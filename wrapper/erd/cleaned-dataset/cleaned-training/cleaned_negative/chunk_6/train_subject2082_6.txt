 Oh. This looks really, really bad. The silly slow motion scene with the bullet, the totally tiresome sound effects in these kind of new trailers, the music, and of course the superficial action scenes they probably had to cut in to compensate the total lack of anything of value I guess this movie has. 




 No, I don't have any reason to limit myself that way. Even if I'm not a big fan of a specific actor, I would never refuse to watch a movie because that specific actor is in it, I think it's better to be more open-minded and not refuse to watch movies because of certain actors. There's of course some movies I would rather watch than some others, but I don't have any need to have a definitive list of actors that I absolute refuse to watch. 




 Kes (1969) by Ken Loach. The cast for the film had authentic Yorkshire accents, which isn't maybe the easiest to understand.    

A little bit of trivia:              

*"In a 2013 interview, director Ken Loach said that, upon its release, United Artists organised a screening of the film for some American executive and they said that they could understand Hungarian better than the dialect in the film."* 




 While I like Tonari no Totoro (1988) more, have you seen Gake no ue no Ponyo (2008)? It's also directed by Miyazaki and could be up your alley too. 




 A good one! One of the better war movies, especially when it comes to portraying the real horrors of war. It's very dark, dirty, haunting and has a great atmosphere. 




 I can think of Le manoir du diable (1896) by Georges Mlis. There's supernatural things happening, but not really any death. 




 Ten of the best/my favourite ones:    

* Eraserhead (1977)     
* Hxan (1922)                      
* Les diaboliques (1955)            
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)                
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)                     
* Onibaba (1964)              
* Possession (1981)          
* Repulsion (1965)              
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)                 
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)             




 There's certainly not many good ones, but I would go with Antichrist (2009) by Lars von Trier. 




 I have the 2-disc set from Artificial Eye that also comes with Krhozat (1988), but I don't remember where the screen came from exactly, I think I've had it on a computer for a while.  









 I would just take it as your favourite director that has at least one movie in the collection. Andrei Tarkovsky for me. 




 One example is L'eclisse (1962). The end is known for being a bit puzzling for many people, but if you haven't seen everything before the end, it will probably be even more puzzling, especially because the main characters the movie is about aren't present at all near the end. You really must have seen the whole movie to be able to put the end of it in some context at all. 




 Liverpool (2008). 




 I don't just like a long film because it's long, time is irrelevant for me. Why I like Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)? Well, first of all, I'm a big fan of the uncompromising outlook Akerman had with the whole movie. It has pretty much everything I love. Static shots, no soundtrack, toned down performances, long takes, depth, important things to say, a very unsentimental story and just a lot of everydayness. The compositions are clever and smart. The color palette is also very stripped down, which works great with the whole form. It almost the epitome of "show, not tell", since it's not that much dialogue either. I really like minimalism, and Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) does it perfectly, but still has great depth in both its character portrayal of Jeanne and the images overall. It's probably one of the biggest and most interesting portraits of a woman in the history of cinema. The portrait of Jeanne is both down to earth and realistic. We really get to know her and suffer with her. It's an important movie both as art and social commentary, mostly because of Akerman's depiction of the role women have in society, what we expect from them and the alienation to society and life. It's a feminist masterpiece if you ask me.       

I like when directors manage to catch the hugeness in the little things in life, which I think is something important in cinema. Akerman even had a theory that you have to look at things long enough to really see them, which is a thrilling point. Just like Tarkovsky, the movie has a sort of disruptive feeling of time. When something has that and keeps me thrilled at the same time, I simply have to embrace and love it.      




 I've watched all those, I also mentioned that No Country for Old Men (2007) looks quite okay. I'm more of a fan of cinematographers like Motokichi Hasegawa, Sven Nykvist (mostly his work with Bergman), Vadim Yusov, Gbor Medvigy, Gianni Di Venanzo etc. When it comes to the newer ones, I prefer Liao Pen-jung, some of Christopher Doyle's work, and Fred Kelemen for example. When it comes to movies like Skyfall (2012) or A Beautiful Mind (2001), I feel that they have that typical Hollywood look that a lot of newer movies have. The specific color gradings, the use of lightning, sometimes too much brightness  for my taste and sometimes not that kind of contrast that has a lot of depth which I like. I'm just not too much into the way those movies look. Sometimes it can do much with the directors certain cinematographers work with, so maybe it has a lot do to with that. If Deakins worked with Lav Diaz or Tsai Ming-liang, then the result would possibly be more something for me, I don't know. As I said, he's not bad at his profession, I simply don't want to put him that high up on my own list. 




 Film Art: An Introduction by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson is a good book to start with. 









 First of all, I haven't seen the movie, so I'm not going to say anything about it's quality, but it still makes me a bit worried and hesitant about it, especially if you know what kind of movies tend to get high ratings. You shouldn't take the IMDb Top 250 that seriously. There's a lot of shadow accounts there, trolls, corrupted votes, people that only use 1 or 10 when they vote etc. And also, any Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account on the site and start voting. I'm not saying that every single user is doing this, but there's absolutely no reason to take the list and the ratings seriously. A big part of the people on IMDb belong to the general public, and I have always felt that the general public isn't the definitive consensus to trust when it comes to cinema, especially not when it comes to a website with that kind of rating system. It's anyways always much more interesting to know what people think about movies if it's those that I know have watched a lot of them, have a lot of knowledge, have studying movies on a more critical and serious level and have a big bubble of references, than just some total strangers I don't know anything about. The IMDb Top 250 is a list by the general Internet public (and possibly some corruption), it's nothing you should look at with a too serious eye. Of course, it's much about taste too. But I think one should have in mind what you are dealing with. For example, people tend to upvote some of the big and newer Hollywood movies like crazy. 




 Of course, just what I said. I can't say I like how movies like The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Skyfall (2012) and A Beautiful Mind (2001) look for example, but Deakins did a better job with No Country for Old Men (2007) to name one. He's good at what he does, I'm just not a huge fan of the majority of his work and how it looks, but that's just my taste. So yeah, there's of course a ton of movies that look much, much worse too. 




 I'm a bit tired of the whole thing with sequels, prequels and remakes in Hollywood today. So I'm not that anticipated for it. Incendies (2010) by Denis Villeneuve wasn't a bad movie, but I can't say I liked Enemy (2013) or the mediocre Prisoners (2013) that much. On the other hand, he is a much better choice as a director than a lot of the other ones working in Hollywood today. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Roger Deakins either, but there's a lot of worse cinematographers out there too. I'm absolutely going to see the movie though. Blade Runner (1982) is a classic, but not one of my favourites, it will still be interesting to see what will be done with this one nonetheless. 




 I believe the person meant that the movie will be based on the novel by Philip K. Dick. 




  and there was one I watched on Amazon prime about a woman who became a photographer in the late 1800 early 1900s but the title is eluding meat the moment.       

You probably mean Maria Larssons eviga gonblick (2008) by Jan Troell. 




 I don't believe it was chosen at random. As I said, the symbol has been imprinted in the culture of Japan for a long time now. You can see it in a lot of places today. Especially in Japan, from lanterns to Buddhist temples. Even the Ku Klux Klan used it. I didn't say it was a direct reference to the clan, but it's worth to read about it and know that it's been used for a long time in different parts of the world. I haven't seen the movie, but since I know it's about the history of Japan and war, it makes more sense that it wouldn't just be a reference to the game series. 




 Here's my top ten films that are non-English:              

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)    
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
3. L'eclisse (1962)     
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      
5. Tanin no kao (1966)      
6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
7. Suna no onna (1964)      
8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)        
9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)      
10. Stntang (1994)    

But yeah, a lot of the foreign films were and still are way ahead of Hollywood in so many ways, especially in this day and age. Most of my favourite movies are not English language ones, it just happened to be that way for now. There's so much good foreign stuff. And of course, a lot of bad. But what's good is quite superior if we compare it to Hollywood. It's the same with directors for me, some of my favourites for the moment are Andrei Tarkovsky, Robert Bresson, Ingmar Bergman, Michael Haneke, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Yasujir Ozu. Right now I'm quite into Japanese cinema, particularly from the 1950s to 1970s. It's almost like a constant project going through foreign/world cinema and discovering and watching films from all over the world, it's interesting and fascinating. And when it comes to overshadowing, it really shows how much foreign cinema is overshadowed if we compare it to Hollywood in a subreddit like this. Not a surprise though, just a thoughtful remark. 




 I don't believe it's a reference to the games, it's a very old symbol that has been around in Japanese culture for a long time. And because this is a movie that's about Japanese history, it makes pretty much sense that it wouldn't just be a reference to the game series.

 It's best to ignore it. It's hard to take the majority of people on those boards seriously. There seems to be a lot of trolls too. 




 Thanks! I totally missed that this is coming before you mentioned it. Pre-ordered it today! I can't wait now! 




 And he's holding some Ozu. 




 1. Paris, Texas (1984)      
2. Naked (1993)     
3. A Woman Under the Influence (1974)      
4. Down by Law (1986)    
5. Do the Right Thing (1989)         




 * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)      
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
* Zerkalo (1975)      




 ICheckMovies has some great and interesting lists. Otherwise it's through books and various film sites etc. 




 Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975). 




 Potential for anything good? Not really. Not if it's going to be in the exact same vein as the previous movies. I feel that it would just be another mainstream franchise that outstayed its welcome. The series was a financial success so far, so I won't be surprised if it actually comes back. I'm just very, very doubtful to the whole thing, but that's me. Especially kids these days would probably like it though. I'm certain that the Shrek series has its fanbase, that's one thing that's sure. If you ask me, I would gladly be without it. 




 That specific quote seems a bit vague. It doesn't say that much for me. Sure, films that scar, make you feel something, stick with you or anything similar are usually those you remember the most and probably stick with you the longest than those movies that are mindless entertainment that you forget about the next day, but it can differ from person to person. People always look for different things in movies, it's always going to be that way. I think Michael Haneke had a great quote going on:      

*"Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that's ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience."*   

I have to say I agree with Haneke a lot. 




 I don't usually look for something specific and written in rock that a horror movie must have for me to like it. It always depends on what a horror movie does and how it does it, that's the main thing. It can be depth, interesting ideas, playfulness, a great atmosphere or anything that just makes me appretiate it a little extra. Horror movies are mostly best when they're not typical in their genre, but rather challenging, innovative, playful or just about anything that makes them stand out in a good way. I guess it's like with any genre, so it's hard to say. I like for example Possession (1981), Repulsion (1965), Spalovac mrtvol (1969), and Onibaba (1964).        

Now, Funny Games (1997) is maybe more of a thriller than a pure horror film, (and the boundaries can be discussed to death) but that's a great example of what I would like to see more of. Movies that are thinking one step ahead and actually have something interesting to say. 




 Which one are you referring to? Do you mean Lt den rtte komma in (2008) by Tomas Alfredson which has that as the English title? If you do, that's a Swedish movie and not a German one. 




 Som great and essential ones in my opinion:      

* Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972)    
* Chronik der Anna Magdalena Bach (1968)      
* Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009)     
* Der freie Wille (2006)      
* Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987)      
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)       
* Faust: Eine deutsche Volkssage (1926)       
* Faustrecht der Freiheit (1975)      
* Im Lauf der Zeit (1976)     
* M (1931)      
* Metropolis (1927)      
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)    
* Stroszek (1977)       
* Tagebuch einer Verlorenen (1929)       

Keep an eye out when it comes to directors like Fritz Lang, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, F.W. Murnau, and Wim Wenders, they have done some of the best stuff when it comes to German cinema. Especially Fassbinder, what a man! He has done many, many great movies. 




 De ofrivilliga (2008) is like Sweden and typical Swedish people in a nutshell. It's almost scary. 




 He's done some good stuff. With no doubt one of the best and coolest directors from Hong Kong for the moment. Maybe even overall. Chung Hing sam lam (1994), Fa yeung nin wa (2000) and Chun gwong cha sit (1997) are my favourites by him.Especially Fa yeung nin wa (2000) must be one of the best films post-2000. I really like the lightning in several of his movies and the use of colors. He's also good at contructing interesting characters that aren't simple and flat, but rather nuanced and at the same time giving the audience both small and fundamental questions about them. There's usually a lot of emotions in the films as well. I'm a bit curious and worried about his latest feature film, Yi dai zong shi (2013), the one about Ip Man, I have to see that one soon. It looks a bit different than some of his other movies. I'm not really a big fan of martial-arts films, so that could also be one reason for my hesitancy.    

When it comes to tracking down Kar-wai's films on DVD, it's quite easy. Criterion Collection released Fa yeung nin wa (2000) on Blu-ray too. And his other ones shouldn't be too hard to find if you look on Amazon and similar sites. I'm happy to help if you have trouble finding something!         

And if we are speaking of similar films, the ones I can think of for now are these three:       

* Bin-jip (2004)       
Kim Ki-duk's movies are mostly either a hit or a miss for me, but this one is probably his best. There's very little dialogue, but I find the relations of the characters to be something similar in the vein of the movies by Kar-wai.            

* Ai qing wan sui (1994)     
More dialogue than the Kim Ki-duk film, but Tsai Ming-liang is much better when it comes to having sparse dialogue. One must check out Tsai Ming-liang if one likes Wong Kar-wai! Ming-liang isn't as straightforward, but I always feel the need to recommend his films. And there's also that similar feeling when it comes to interactions with the characters.         

* Stranger Than Paradise (1984)       
Jim Jarmusch has that special coolness that we can see in Kar-wai as well. Very likeable stuff!     

I don't know if you have seen these three, but it will probably show! 




 It feels like the majority of the movies in that list are big movies people already know of and that already are quite popular on Reddit, for example The Godfather (1972), The Green Mile (1999), Reservoir Dogs (1992), No Country for Old Men (2007), American History X (1999), The Shawshank Redemption (1994) etc. It doesn't have to be a bad thing, but I would love to list some crime dramas that are some of my favourites outside of that list too:      

* Ascenseur pour l'chafaud (1958)     
* Blue Velvet (1986)      
* Du rififi chez les hommes (1955)     
* Le doulos (1962)      
* Le samoura (1967)    
* Le trou (1960)    
* Pickpocket (1959)    
* Pierrot le fou (1965)     
* The Limits of Control (2009)      
* Touchez pas au grisbi (1954)      

None of these are that obscure either, but they're not as well known as some of the big Hollywood classics in the list from the link, so maybe someone discovers something new from my recommendations as well. 




 Sayat Nova (1969) by Sergei Parajanov is a great one. It's a stylized, surreal and beautiful biography of the Armenian poet Sayat Nova. Parajanov was more interested in revealing the poet's life in a visual and poetic way rather than literally. One interesting fact is that Sofiko Chiaureli played six different characters in the movie. There's no real dialogue or any camera movement either. 




 I agree, this should be a standard everywhere. It would especially benefit those who have impaired hearing too. 




 A cracker. According to the Silent Era website, the survival status seems to be unknown, same with the current rights holder. Even the following is stated on the site: "It is unclear whether this film was actually produced."   


Your best shot will probably be to come in contact with the production company, Regia Kunstfilms Co. and/or DFI (Danish Film Institute) and see what they say. 




 Nobi (1959) by Kon Ichikawa is great. War, starvation, absurdity and chaos. 




 I wouldn't say that always suck, it really depends on how they are made etc. But there's of course a lot of bad examples. On the other hand, Andrei Tarkovsky made some of the most amazing dream sequences ever. Zerkalo (1975), Stalker (1979), Nostalghia (1983) and Offret (1986) have all great and beautiful dream sequences. 

Ingmar Bergman really said it:      
*"Tarkovsky for me is the greatest (director), the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream."* 




 Get some from Criterion Collection and Eureka (Masters of Cinema), they have a lot of great movies. L'eclisse (1962), Pickpocket (1959) and Seppuku (1962) are some that I really recommend. 




  Not your favorite movies, but the ones you think influenced the filmmaking industry, or are perfectly told stories.

That's making it a little irrelevant, complicated and strange. It's not always that or this way. Someones favourite movies could be perfectly told stories, the perfectly told stories one prefers could be movies the person thinks influenced filmmaking in big ways etc. Reasons can hang together and differ. For example, my favourite movies are the same as the ones I think are the best of all time. So here they are:      

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)       
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
3. L'eclisse (1962)     
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
5. Tanin no kao (1966)     
6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       
7. Suna no onna (1964)        
8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)     
9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)      
10. Stntang (1994)        




 Krhozat (1988) is great and there's a lot of rain in it. 




  He would often ask his actors to perform the same scene 60 times in a row, until all pretensions of acting and "constructedness" would disappear and what would be left were the words, plain and simple.    

This isn't completely true. It's mostly a rumour people spread around, that he made them repeat something like that so much. In Ingela Romare's book about Bresson, there is a long interview with him where he said that it's false and just rumour about his way of working. He simply made his models utter a sentence and asked them to not think about what they were saying. He could also ask them to think about something else than the content in what they were saying.      




 I think you are missing a lot. First of all, to understand Robert Bresson you have to forget all about how a film "should be". I suggest reading Notes sur le cinmatographe (also published in English as Notes on the Cinematographer), there you will find his own kind of "rules", formulas and guidelines when it comes to cinema. He used it a lot in his own films. Robert Bresson despised the way in which the majority of films were made. He was of the opinion that the majority of cinema was filmed theatre, that's why he created a new sort of film language, his own cinematography. I would also suggest to not even think of comparing Lynch with him, that's just pointless from the beginning. Both of them have made some great films, but they don't have much in common at all. To make it easier, Bresson's style doesn't have much in common with much at all.           

Bresson wanted to separate cinema from the theater, he stripped the cinema to only the bare essentials. He was quite interested in other artforms, such as literature and painting, so much in his style is influenced from those fields rather than film. Look at the acting for example. The people in Bresson's movies were called models by him, he didn't want to call them actors at all. The point with his kind of "acting" was to make the models say their lines in a kind of automatic way, which didn't have focus on them making a performance, but rather acheiving automatism. In my opinion, this also had an effect that made it subtle, powerful and raw. And therefore it also left room to fill the characters with your own emotions, aside from those you already got from the beginning.     

The people in his movies were taken from life, Bresson required that they didn't have any connection to film or theater. Have in mind that I mostly speak of his later films now, his earlier movies were not made the same way. Anyways, he used people which were not taught to be natural. Classic acting had a learned naturalness, something which was absurd to him. The people in his films were supposed to be (models), not pretend to be (actors). Bresson even tried to not use the same model twice. Everything from the theatrical expressions was meant to be taken away, that was the point in which Bresson wanted to bring out the authenticity, a realism in the way of just being human. Facial expressions, movements, gestures and voices, everything was supposed to be as neutral as possible. This is something that was the total opposite of typical acting, because Bresson felt that typical acting was closer to the theater than to cinema. A person who has been indoctrinated in the theater when it comes to expression, that person can't show genuine emotions on screen, that would just be emotions that have been learned, which equals fake emotions. Bresson was interested in the purely "physical" in people. He didn't tell which feelings he wanted his models to show, he just gave them physical instructions such as how the model should move, what the model should look at etc.      

He was also a perfectionist and a minimalist. That means every image, sound, move etc. is supposed to be there and has its own meaning of being there. This is why many of his movies are a bit shorter than your average flick. This guy stripped cinema to the bare essentials, but still managed to make huge art. The thing with Bresson is the special relationship between images and sounds together with important questions about human beings, it's so special that you won't really find it anywhere else, not like in his movies. It's just pure film magic in my opinion. Some people can watch films all their life and still not understand Bresson, which isn't shocking at all, because you really need to study his style to truly understand him, I'm almost certain that you barely scratched the surface of this man and his movies, especially if you think his visual style is "dull", that it's "lacking" and when you say you don't see the point. Study, read his book, watch his films, and examine critically. This can take years, but understanding Bresson isn't something you do after two or three of his movies. It takes time. We are not talking about taste now, have that in mind. We are just talking about understanding. I also have a great book about him by Ingela Romare, but it's in Swedish, so it's a bit hard to recommend if it isn't your first language. There may be something else you could find in English though (besides his own book). Anyways, If you have the interest to understanding Bresson properly, you have to commit and do it properly. Good luck if you want it. And don't rush. 














 I think it will suck too. Just like the first one. It was just silly and trying too hard. Talk about cheap jokes. No finesse or charm whatsoever. 




 Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz. 




 You maybe feel that way because the movies by John Carpenter and George Romero were a big influence on the film's compositions and visual aesthetic. Wide-angle lenses were also used to help give the film its look. The soundtrack obviously echoes Carpenter too.

 One of the best westerns ever made. Amazing soundtrack and memorable characters. A true classic that's very rewatchable. I got sad when I heard that Eli Wallach died. It's almost been a year now. 




 It was quite silly, yeah. But I didn't really expect it to be great, especially as Nolan never impressed me before. I find him quite mediocre. I have been talking about it in some threads before, so I'm probably going to repeat myself, but I disliked Interstellar (2014) mostly because Nolan seems to be unable to tell with pictures. Everything is already explained with dialogue and/or voice-over, there is nothing left to the imagination. But that's probably because the film is so flat and empty that there isn't anything left to leave to the viewer. To make it as unsubtle and clear as possible seems to be Nolan's last hope of deceiving himself and the audience that there is something in the movie and that it's smart.      
Matthew McConaughey's character is paraphrasing and saying that the world only consists of crafsmen, but lacks of visionaries. That's quite funny, because Nolans doesn't really have any visions at all.      

The soundtrack by Zimmer is also all over the place and so pompous and nobby that it feels more like a parody. On top of that, the screenplay had ancient gender roles, doubtful New Age philosophy about love and a lot of silly crying.     

About the IMDb Top 250, that's something one shouldn't pay attention to at all. Everyone can make an account and start voting on that site. A lot of the votes are corrupt, people create fake accounts, some users only use 1 and 10 when rating etc. It's hard to take it seriously, the whole top list is better off being ignored. Another thing, you don't have to be missing something just because you didn't like a movie, it can rather be the movie that's missing something. Everything doesn't have to be so single sided. 














 Hulu Plus seems to be something for you. They pretty much have nearly everything Criterion released and some more. Fandor and Mubi could be something worth looking into also. Another thing to consider is visiting libraries, they actually have more stuff than you think. It's of course not the same everywhere, but it's worth a shot. Don't forget about YouTube either, you can find a lot of classic films there. Many are in the public domain, so those are free and totally legal. 




 George Clooney's first film wasn't From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). He started acting in the late seventies, made his first role ever in 1978 (in a mini-series) and his first movie role in And They Are Off (1982). 




 Threse three are great and a lot more mature than the typical fantasy stuff:       

* Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987)      
* Duelle (une quarantaine) (1976)   
* Ugetsu monogatari (1953)        




 Wu Wu Mian (2015) by Tsai Ming-liang, great short. You can watch it here:

 Ten of my favourite ones:    

* Eraserhead (1977)     
* Hxan (1922)                      
* Les diaboliques (1955)            
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)                
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)                     
* Onibaba (1964)              
* Possession (1981)          
* Repulsion (1965)              
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)                 
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)             




 It's going to be a lot of movies for you if everyone is going to give you three films from each year starting from 2000 until now. And of the ones I have seen and rated from that span, I haven't given a single one more than a 4/5 rating, and those that got it are less than forty movies all together. So I'm going to give you fifteen of the best films I have seen from 2000 until now that I really recommend:       

* A torini l (2011)          
* Book chon bang hyang (2011)    
* Cach (2005)     
* Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009)             
* Fa yeung nin wa (2000)     
* Mies vailla menneisyytt (2002)     
* Mulholland Dr.	(2001)       
* My Winnipeg (2007)     
* Ni neibian jidian (2001)       
* No Quarto da Vanda (2000)       
* Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)      
* The Act of Killing (2012)      
* The Limits of Control (2009)      
* Werckmeister harmnik (2000)          
* White Material (2009)       




 I'm not really surprised. 




  This Transient Life (1970)      

I have to rewatch that one soon. So damn good! 









 Yaju no seishun (1963). Seijun Suzuki did some good action in the 60s. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 I haven't seen Transformers (2007) yet. 




 No female character's dream, big motivation, ambition or idea, is really truly their own. They're not really independent. It's quite interesting to consider that the role of Murph was originally written for a male too. But that later changed. Anyways, what I am trying to say is that the independence of the women in the film only go so far as to make it work mostly for the big male figure in their existance. The women are dependant on their so called hopes to make their special big male figure proud, and in the end also to complete his lifelong dream, not really their own.     
Much of the movie moves along according to men and that they are the dynamic ones, which leaves women in reactive positions. Every woman seems to be forced to hold onto the hand of the big male figure that abandoned them. None of the women would have their ambitious striving without a so called strong, adventurous, independent and lovable male lead. To make it short, this is just some of the problems the movie has, so I hope I have given you some answers to your curiosity. 




 I agree that it's overrated. I dislike it mostly because Nolan is unable to tell with pictures. Everything is already explained with dialogue and/or voice-over, there is nothing left to the imagination. There is nothing that is subtle. The soundtrack by Zimmer is just all over the place and so pompous and nobby that it feels more like a parody. On top of that, the screenplay had tiresome gender roles, doubtful New Age philosophy about love and a lot of crying. 




 The movie you are looking for is Kurutta ippji (1926) by Teinosuke Kinugasa. Good stuff. I recently got it on DVD, but the transfer wasn't really that good. It really deserves a nice restoration, a Blu-ray release would be amazing. It's just sad that the existing print of it is missing a big part of the film too. By the way, when it was screened in Japan in the 1920s, it would have included live narration by a storyteller or so called benshi as well as musical accompaniment. 




 This is what you should be looking after:     
  
* A torini l (2011)       
* Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     
* Krhozat (1988)     
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963)     
* L'amour  mort (1984)       
* Le feu follet (1963)      
* No Quarto da Vanda (2000)     
* Offret (1986)       
* Petla (1958)      
* Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)       
* Stntang (1994)       
* Viskningar och rop (1972)     
* Werckmeister harmnik (2000)      




 Woody Allen. 




 One of the most beautiful movies I've watched this year is Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969). Amazing cinematography. It doesn't make it worse that it's a very complex and interesting look at sex, history and politics. It's what I would call aesthetic perfection! Some user here on Reddit posted an album with screenshots from it, here is a (NSFW) link: http://imgur.com/a/MAxel          




 I'm guessing it could be Rak ti Khon Kaen (2015) by Apichatpong Weerasethakul. But if Lav Diaz, Michael Haneke and Abbas Kiarostami all come out with a new film this year, it could be one of theirs. 




 Easy one. Max von Sydow. One of his most memorable roles for me is as Karl Oskar in Utvandrarna (1971) and Nybyggarna (1972) by Jan Troell. 




 "Top-tier" directors is maybe subjective, I would for example not put Guy Ritchie anywhere near the top of anything. And well known doesn't always mean that someone is good, so we have that part too.

But to answer your question, I think Jeanne Moreau would probably be the hardest one to beat in the first place. Just look at this list of the directors she has worked with: 

* Michelangelo Antonioni    
* Luis Buuel   
* Louis Malle      
* Jacques Becker   
* Marguerite Duras    
* Tsai Ming-liang   
* Jean Renoir       
* Rainer Werner Fassbinder   
* Manoel de Oliveira      
* Franois Truffaut    
* Marcel Ophls      
* Joseph Losey      
* Orson Welles   
* Elia Kazan      
* Theo Angelopoulos    
* Wim Wenders     




 Bronenosets Potemkin (1925) by Sergei M. Eisenstein. The ultimate one. One of the most influential films in the history of cinema, the montage techniques in it are as relevant and important today as it was in the 1920s. Early propaganda movies from the Soviet Union is what you should look into if you want to see montage editing at its best. 




 Il sorpasso (1962). Great road movie about an impulsive and extroverted excitement seeker who meets an introverted and straitlaced law student. A hell of a ride. 




 Have you seen Smultronstllet (1957) by Ingmar Bergman? If not, that is the ultimate one. 




 I think it was because of the cover art and/or the extras. 




 Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) is probably the best one. A great portrait of the contemporary West Berlin from the eighties.     

Some other ones that are very good:       

* Der letzte Mann (1924)         
* Despair (1978)          
* Die Ehe der Maria Braun (1979)       
* Die dritte Generation (1979)      
* M (1931)      
* Possession (1981)      

Worth mentioning too:       

* Germania anno zero (1948)       
* Menschen am Sonntag (1930)     
* Variet (1925)        

I would also recommend to check out Fassbinder's massive and epic Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) if you have the time. It's more of a mini-series, but was made to be a single film, so the limitations can be discussed on that part, but it's a very interesting depiction of Berlin in the late-1920s. All hail Fassbinder! 




 It was already announced two months ago, it was just postponed a bit. 









 Mulholland Dr. (2001) is a must watch. 




 None of them. I watch what I want to watch. I have never used those sites to be sure if I should watch anything or not. 









 Some of my absolute favourite war films:            

* Apocalypse Now (1979)       
* Csillagosok, katonk (1967)       
* Idi i smotri (1985)      
* Ivanovo detstvo (1962)       
* L'arme des ombres (1969)        
* La battaglia di Algeri (1966)       
* Lacombe Lucien (1974)       
* Nobi (1959)      
* Paths of Glory (1957)      
* Popil i diament (1958)       
* Voskhozhdenie (1977)         




 Solyaris (1972), the best movie ever when it comes to space and science fiction. 




 I think I would choose Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969). It would probably be amazing. 




 Favourite actress: Setsuko Hara	   
Favourite actor: Chish Ry         
Favourite director: Andrei Tarkovsky       
Favourite movie: Der siebente Kontinent (1989)        




 I rather feel that bland visuals, no emotions, doing many things and the loud and clear message also applies to movies that aren't independent. I can see these kind of things in both independent movies and the big mainstream blockbusters from Hollywood for example. So the so called mistakes are quite common in pretty much films of all kinds, I don't think they should only be paired together with movies that are independent. The indie label just states that a movie is produced outside of the major film studio system, completely or partly, it doesn't actually say anything else, something that many people believe. Also, if someone feels that a movie is incomprehensible, it doesn't have to be the director's mistake, it could rather be the viewer's fault, something worth to remember. It doesn't always have to be that one sided. 




 1. Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)      
2. Book chon bang hyang (2011)     
3. A torini l (2011)        




 I don't know where you got something Japanese from. Maybe you answered the wrong person? Funny Games (1997) is an Austrian movie in German. The remake is in English. 




 Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz is the best movie I've seen from the last two years. Really great. I can really recommend it. 




 Yeah, you could say that. 




 It's not really that different. Actors and the language aren't the same, but that's mostly it. They're both directed by Haneke. The remake was just aimed for the American audience. 









 Funny Games (1997) is some good stuff. 




 Yaj no seishun (1963) or Buta to gunkan (1961). 




 Some of the better ones working today:   

* Abbas Kiarostami          
* Aki Kaurismki	      
* Aleksandr Sokurov         
* Apichatpong Weerasethakul      
* David Lynch      
* Hirokazu Koreeda     
* Hong Sang-soo       
* Jafar Panahi      
* Jean-Luc Godard       
* Jim Jarmusch       
* Lav Diaz      
* Michael Haneke   
* Pedro Costa          
* Peter Greenaway    
* Tsai Ming-liang         




 I can't see the real challenge in it. It isn't as hard as you may think. Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972), Tky monogatari (1953), La libertad (2001), Le rvlateur (1968), Bu san (2003), and Akibiyori (1960) are some examples I can think of after some seconds. And they don't have any certain plot holes really. Also, there's a lot of more experimental/avant-garde movies that could fit, same with many shorts. My examples were movies with a more standard narrative though. It all depends on where you want to draw the line and how picky you want to be. 




 My favourite is La jete (1962) by Chris Marker. 




 * Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)    
* Stntang (1994)     




 It sounds like When a Stranger Calls Back (1993) by Fred Walton, could it be it? 




 Naked Lunch (1991) and Where the Buffalo Roam (1980). 









 I don't think it's odd at all. I think it's rather great that people dress however they want when they're directing a movie and not going after some special dress code. There's no reason for it. It can get rather hectic, hot, excruciating and stressful on a movie set, therefore people probably show up in what feels best and comfortable for them in that kind of situation. Taste is also subjective. 




 La jete (1962) by Chris Marker and Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais. 




 Here are five of the best ones I have seen:     

* Csillagosok, katonk (1967)    
* J'accuse! (1919)     
* Paths of Glory (1957)   
* La grande illusion (1937)    
* The Big Parade (1925)         




 Still hoping for Woody Allen. 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. A true masterpiece. 




 Some great examples I really like:

* Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978)         
Anna, a female director is on tour for her newest film. She goes from France to Germany and back to Paris. While in Germany, she travels around there a bit and we get to see the people she meets.         

* Saraba natsu no hikari (1968)     
Kawamura is a professor touring Europe. He meets Naoko, a married woman living in Paris, scarred by the Nagasaki atomic bombings. A romance blooms and they travel around Europe trying to find themselves.        

* Stroszek (1977)        
Street singer and former mental patient Bruno teams up with a prostitute and an older man to travel from Germany to the United States in search for a better life.        

* Topio stin omichli (1988)       
A road movie about two children (Voula and Alexandre) searching for their father who dissapeared, but is supposed to live in Germany.     




 You have to check out Posetitel muzeya (1989) and Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) by Konstantin Lopushanskiy. Both have a very similar post-apocalyptic vibe. Lopushanskiy also worked as a production assistant on Stalker (1979). 




 Dreyer! Thumbs up. Such a great movie.
