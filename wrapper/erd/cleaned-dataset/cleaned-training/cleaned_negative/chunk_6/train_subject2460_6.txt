 Howard Stern stayed on air that day long after his usual sign off.  His two following shows on 9/12 and 9/13 really were just as important.  A large part of the Stern Show is that regular employees become "characters" on the show, almost like a reality show.  The 9/12 and 9/13 shows told the various experiences the staff had in the wake of the terrorist attacks, from Robin having to hitch a ride with Scott the Engineer to try to get home, Bababooey trying to get home and explain to his young kids what exactly happened, Stuttering John leaving to go pick up his kids from their school because other children were being evacuated to his kid's school, Doug Goodstein using his press creds. to go down to lower Manhattan to make sandwiches for the rescue workers, etc.
