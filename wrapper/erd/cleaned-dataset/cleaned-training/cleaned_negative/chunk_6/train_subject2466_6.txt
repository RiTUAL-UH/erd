 Detasseling corn in Nebraska. I started doing this every summer when I was in sixth grade. This job consists of getting up at 4 in the morning to catch the school bus that leaves at 5, riding for an hour to some random corn field, getting off the bus, putting on safety glasses and gloves, walking through the dew soaked corn field freezing cold to pick the tassels off the tops of the corn stalks.  Then in the afternoon it gets killer hot (since this takes place in July), and it wouldn't be so bad but you have to wear long sleeves and long pants to protect yourself from the corn.  Then you go home, wash off your crusty mud shoes, through your clothes in the wash, take a shower, go to sleep, wake up for supper, pack your lunch, go back to sleep...and repeat for about 2 weeks (no days off). 




 Did you guys have a falling out with the members of My Chemical Romance, does the song "Pretty Handsome Awkward" have anything to do with Gerard Way....or is all that drama just rumors? 




 nope...he lives with his parents and has tried killing himself three times since the divorce (12 years ago). 




 Cheating on my father and divorcing him all within a short time period.  Not because it hurt me directly but because it about killed my dad.
