 I have a Sony A6000 and I've also had a few Canons and Nikons. I LOVE my Sony. The af and shutterspeed are amazing perks to their line. The only gripe I have is the digital viewfinder. But being that it IS mirrorless, what else would I expect? Don't get me wrong, they do a great job with it, however it can be a bit frustrating. 

The lag isn't bad at all, but definitely noticeable when shooting a moving object. 




 Can anybody here refer me to the best bargain for Canvas Prints?

I want to start putting some of my work on display, and although I don't expect large 3 panel split canvases to be cheap, I am still looking for the best bang for my buck.

Cheapest place I have found so far is Costco, plus they conveniently let me upload my photos and I can preview each concept.

Any/all information is appreciated! 









 I saw the same sign at an abortion clinic 




 It looks like it could get me really high
