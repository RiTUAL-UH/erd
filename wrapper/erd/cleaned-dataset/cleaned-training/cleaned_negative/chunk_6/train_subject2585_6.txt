 Yeah,I thought he cut her baby out because she said she had a stomach ache and her son made a "cute" little thing. But I can never be so sure for there was not enough information. 




 That was pretty good, that actual scared me compared to the other ones I've read. 




 Your amazing! I love this story 10/10 ha ah ha love it. 




 I laughed too, it was pretty funny. 




 This is amazing! 




 For some reason when you mentioned the cameras, the first thing I thought of was five nights at freddy's 




 Always in the name of science...  




 I was thinking that too, because of the cold touch and inhuman strength. 




 This is confusing. 




 Maybe instead of trying to see if the Shampe was real, they could have wanted to capture it. 




 Of course that's normal, just lock it up somewhere before you go to bed. 




 Maybe you should settle down, but you probably won't listen to me anyway. 




 You deserve some happiness, this is the best ending ever!!!!! 




 hmm this is really a problem, you should go to a church or something. 




 How about you try to talk it out with the creepy guy on the phone, he could be death or something.
