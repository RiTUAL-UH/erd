 And American men are sent to other sports like American football, basketball, and baseball.  




 Really depends on height also. I can gain 1 pound of muscle a week.  




 Done with being the tall lanky guy. Boost confidence, be stronger, be able to through my weight around when needed at work  




 Record bench of 250 after starting at 185 a few months ago. 
Record weight of 180. I never weighed more than 170 and was 155 back in March. 
Friends I hadn't seen in months noticed my bulk, talking to girls at the bar has never been easier  




 Unpopular thought here. When you're really skinny your BF is also low. Gain muscle and BF. Who cares if you have fat as long as it's not a gut? Cut when you get to a good size. I've gained half fat half muscle but I still look better and most importantly I'm stronger  




 Gotcha. I'm all in favor of donations funding it. Seems like the most effective "charity donation" someone could make

 It has already received new private funding  




 It's been funded again by private funds.  




 Pac attendence is suffering. I'm not sure how it compares to other years. Colorado is still above 90% capacity despite that embarrassment of a season  




 This is a comment I'd expect from you in /r/cfb  




 Nothing close to Jump Around in Madison. They stopped playing it and consulted with engineers to make sure the stadium could handle the shaking before bringing it back  




 This should become more popular, at least in America

 Thanks for saying "free". Most people don't understand that. 
Clinic visits play a role in preventive health but education and out of clinic programs are huge too. Things to get people moving and eating better  




 Like working on making society less violent.  




 I haven't heard anything from him about preventive medicine. Obesity related illnesses are the biggest cause of death. 3/4 of Americans will be overweight/obese by 2020. That's 5 years away. Yeah the healthcare system needs some work but it's way better to fix health at the source  




 Hunting is how you get bear arms

 Yeah let's have it so only criminals have guns, that's a great idea.  




 No gun? Shit better grab my knife. 
Why do you think most murders are in poor and urban areas? It's culture. 
[A 2001 study looked specifically at 34 adolescent mass murderers, all male. 70 percent were described as a loner. 61.5 percent had problems with substance abuse. 48 percent had preoccupations with weapons; 43.5 percent had been victims of bullying. Only 23 percent had a documented psychiatric history of any kindwhich means three out of four did not.] (http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/actually-know-connections-mental-illness-mass-shootings-gun-violence-83103). Do a little research instead of believing everything the mainstream press tells you.  




 Jeb said he took offense  




 Because it's not about sanders or bashing trump  




 ......exactly  




 It's not mental problems, it's culture. The minority of violent acts stem from mental illness 




 And we know how well that went  




 Ban guns and we won't have shootings! 
Completely wrong. Fix our violent society.  




 His vision is a utopia.  




 "Folks who do not like guns is fine. But we have millions of people who are gun owners in this country -- 99.9% of those people obey the law," Sanders said

 I believe you can get them with permit/certification. It also differs by state

 Who would have expected the poor who couldn't afford insurance would be sicker? I bet obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease make up a huge chunk of the "unexpected"  




 I'd like to see the numbers. How much they got in fees, how much they paid to healthcare, how much was administrative costs.  




 It says he wants to ban semi-automatic weapons but the article doesn't say anything about fully automatic. Shouldn't it be the other way around? I appreciate that he recognizes one 0.1% of gun owners use it for crime but his stances seem inconsistent  














 Except most institutions are constantly barely getting by. Good luck taxing organizations with no money.  




 The purpose of a business is to maximize profit, and many businesses are very good at it. If forced to give people paid maternity leave, they will find some where to compensate the lost money. Possibly expansion funds (yes they exist)  or termination of other employees

 That's why the front page is entirely "Sanders has big crowd!"

 Don't forget about Red Gym  




 Colorado voted against hosting the Olympics because they didn't want higher taxes and a destroyed environment. This works both ways

 Hourly? It's every few minutes  




 It's simple, anything that cost private companies money will be avoided by them. I'm interested in this plan, I'm sure I'll see it on the front page when it comes out  




 I've only met ground crew for fight for life at my ER but the north Colorado med evac crew is great too. Helicopter ems is bigger in Colorado than most states because of how quickly you can be somewhere that it takes hours to get to a hospital  




 defense, TSA, education. TSA fails miserably. We don't need this big of a military. We already spend the most on education. The issue with education isn't money, it's lack of a home life to motivate learning and a flawed teacher seniority system  




 So the tax makes money based on the amount of trade and he wants that trade to decrease which would give him less money than predicted? That makes no sense  




 And this is the same government you want in charge of health care  




 Colorado EMS has lost many people too soon this year. I'm hoping my company does something to reach out  




 /r/Murica 




 Do you not know what day it is? 




 That estimate is with current conditions. Add a tax and the amount of trade will decrease.  




 [Unless you decrease government spending] (http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2015/04/03-government-spending-can-cut-deficit-aaron) 




 [Scale back government programs](http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2015/04/03-government-spending-can-cut-deficit-aaron). The government just throws money at things instead of finding a way to improve them efficiently 




 I have a hard time believing that will come up with the [$400 billion] (http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-total-amount-spent-per-year-on-university-tuition-in-the-United-States) needed. Plus, people will find a way around it. People will follow the path of least resistance. I won't even get into the other consequences of free college because that's not what this posts is about  









 All the government wants is your money  




 Sanders plan is to spend money everywhere. Free healthcare, free tuition etc. I haven't seen anyone do the math on if his tax proposals would generate enough funds, possibly because he's been to vague on his plan.  




 Why not Rand Paul? 




 Yes that was updated 
Edit- the newa originally stated only injuries and the article updated to show the one fatality. Why downvote? 




 CU's season kick off for 2014 also has listed at 23rd 




 On the CU football  wiki, maybe that hadn't been updated since last season  









 Baylor  




 23rd in all time wins 




 In light of reddit recent events, posts the angriest fans of college football 

I'll start with [the classic] (https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2895936/osunoo.0.gif) 




 If I'm doing discontinued teams then I'll do Marquette. The MU and UW combo would make heads roll  




 Spring football/basketball? 




 Yeah I saw that, it's for frats  




 Lurker making a post, forgive me if I missed answers to this. I played some lacrosse in high school, now finishing school in Boulder after deciding against the CU club team because of time restraints. I've been itching to get back into play and have come across some boulder leagues. I was wondering if anyone here plays in them and has recommendations. I'm not sure what gear I have left from high school but I know I'll need a new stick and helmet.  




 I've been on that sub a few times, they love Colorado. I played years ago but didn't have the time for our club team. There's a boulder league I'm looking at but I wish they would do intramural  




 Yeah our men's club could easily make the jump. I'm not saying they would be an immediate power house, but they could compete. They won nationals in 2014, lost in the final last season. Women's moved to d1 via title ix and do decently but were a shitty club team beforehand. We have everything in place for it to happen, they just need to navigate title ix restrictions. A rivalry would easily form between CU and DU. 

The Denver outlaws pro team won a title recently, DU won ncaa, Colorado and CSU have recent club titles, ncaa regional was in Denver, world games were here last year. It's getting big in Colorado  




 Game 3 this year, Sept 19, 5pm at mile high  




 Colorado won nationals in 2014. They had two plays on ESPN top 10 but I can't find the video now  




 [Here's ticket info] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml? DB_OEM_ID=600 ATCLID=209140439). It looks like Oregon is family weekend so that's another way tickets will be harder to get. You should look into mini packs. It's $77 for 3 games but you could get better seats if you pay a bit more money. I highly recommend going to the Rocky Mountain Showdown. It isn't a huge crowd but there is plenty of hate to go around, especially with recent years. 




 We did, and Cross Country  




 What time zone? 
East Coast people can enjoy a 1am match up of Colorado at Hawaii on what's technically a Friday morning  




 What is the most popular spring sport at your school? 
Colorado has no popular spring sport but hopefully lacrosse if it gets added like Girls  lacrosse did  




 University of Denver doesn't even have a team. Their lacrosse though, I would go nuts if CU made a d1 team half that good  




 Are you in the Boulder area? Those tickets will be "harder" to come by. I say harder because season ticket holders and students won't be giving up their tickets, USC has a huge alumni base in Colorado, and Oregon has random fans everywhere. 
Best advice, don't get tickets in the visitors area, those are the worst seats in the stadium. I would just go to the Folsom box office web page and buy tickets before season starts. Sure you could get some scalped tickets a few days before the game but the could be more expensive.  




 I haven't seen any Nebraska or CSU attire on tours. I'll see the occasional CSU shirt and people will look at them funny but that's it. 
For some reason people think it'd 100% OK to never wear CU gear but always wear USC/UCLA. Even when the team comes to town they'll wear that to games. I don't give a shit that you're from LA and your dad is the dean of X California schools, you're at CU now  




 That's just not a person you want at the school if they were serious. Not because of being a rival fan but total disrespect of an academic institution that's taking time to consider you  




 As if I needed another reason to hate Ohio State fans  




 It would be too easy  




 USC  




 Or don't identify with a party and vote who you agree with on what issues you prioritize. According to reddit all Republicans are Bible thumping, Confederate Flag flying, money counting, trump lovers

 I swear CU is half California kids anyways  




 If it makes up the entire front page, it's clearly not being ignored  









 There's a difference between popular and spamming. People are still posting the attendance articles. Do they not look at the front page? They're just trying to spam and get karaoke. You don't need 20+ posts saying Sanders got a big crowd.  




 I didn't say anything about the event, I said this sub is immature.  




 I'm originally from Wisconsin. I had two elections and a recall there. The divide in Wisconsin is insane.  




 Because people will whine about politics and then are too lazy to actually do anything. 
You seem like you vote often, which is good.
