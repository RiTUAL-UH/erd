 Pretty good horror film that managed to glide away from typical horror film clichs, however I felt the third act went downhill a bit. 




 Only in earlier operating system versions. 




 Even though xxPielsTastyxX is correct, the flight time of the entire mission would of only been about a minute long. I attempted launching a large platform craft, however it ran out of fuel as I was hovering over the ocean. Parachutes were then engaged and somehow a big piece of platform and an escape pod survived.
