 [More info on silly hat strap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police#Uniform_.E2.80.93_troopers_to_sergeants):

"The PSP trademark item is the campaign style hat with the chin strap worn in the front under the chin on the winter campaign hat(as opposed to most agencies that wear the strap of the campaign hat behind the head). The hat contains a blackened commonwealth coat of arms. It is required to be worn whenever the trooper is outdoors. It is made of dark gray felt (for wintertime wear) or light gray straw (for summertime wear). The strap of the summer hat is worn behind the head.

Also, as an optional part of the winter uniform, troopers may wear a black "woolly-pully" commando sweater over their uniform shirts, along with a vinyl/fur winter hat." 
























 Mine even had a comment on it. 




 Same thing happened to me
