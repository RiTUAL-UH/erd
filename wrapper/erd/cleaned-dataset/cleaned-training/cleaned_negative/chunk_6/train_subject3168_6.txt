 I quit August 8th, 2013, and now less than 3 weeks until my one year anniversary of being smoke and nicotine free, I feel like I can breath and that I've broken free of something and completed a task that for years I had deemed "impossible".  A person who never gives up, never fails.  




 Wow! Amazing seats! 




 Oh, i didn't know it had it's own video, I saw it as part of something else, like a Not Poop Games.  Thanks though. 









 I also run a headless arch server and have been running it for the last few years.  I'm wondering why would anyone run a server that wasn't headless? 




 *facepalm* I'm dumb, thanks, that did it /u/dangersalad and /u/mrkipling  




 and my ~/.i3/i3status.conf:
