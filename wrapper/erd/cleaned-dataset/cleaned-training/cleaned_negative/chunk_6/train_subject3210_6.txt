 Where you from OP? Your lingo sounds like you're from my neck of the woods.  




 The feeling of being watched is not a sense. It is not observed by any sensory organs. That's like saying sense of humor is a sense.  




 I don't like you anymore.  




 Good luck OP 




 You're confusing sensation with senses. We have 5 senses that gather billions of sensations and retain that knowledge. You know where your limbs are when you can't see them because through your sense of touch you've learned that if you don't keep track of them, you will get hurt.
