 You are right. Youtube titles can never be trusted.  




 It was in an actual court of law.  But that doesn't prove Ray's innocence, just that they found him not guilty. He is innocent because he didn't do it. If you take a look at the evidence, it will probably not change your mind, but it may keep you from saying things are are dumb and unfounded. 

If you understood civil court you wouldn't say it was anything like Judge Judy. 

And to this day the King family doesn't believe Ray did it.  




 Actually they dont have accountability. If they fail at their job, they can falsify reports, their fellow officers will cover for them, get paid leave of absence while the non-investigation takes place, etc.  Then there are the police unions. The problem is they are not accountable to anyone.   




 It's crazy, but I can't wait to see who we get.  In Reggie We Trust.   




 Exactly. People are so afraid of being alone, that anyone will do. 

It reminds me of what some comedian once said: that marriage for him will probably be like in gym class when the instructor tells everyone to pair up. Everyone shuffles around real quick and finds a partner. He's just standing there looking around. Then before he knows it everyone is paired up, except for some girl on the other side of the gym who, by default, must be his partner.  




 To me, denial = delusion. And for every problem you deny, you create about four more that you may or may not be aware of.  




 I used to know an old guy who once told me, "It's better to be lonely than to wish you were." 




 Just got too damn cold. And lonely.   




 Police can't police themselves.  









 If she can't notice a text on her phone from someone she already verbally committed to (and respond), then she should be dropped even quicker.

Right, she's just too busy and distracted with life to undertake the most basic of functions, which don't get much simpler.  She could do it in 3 seconds while on the toilet.
 




 Neither James Earl Ray nor James Earl Jones killed MLK.

["The jury found that King had been the victim of assassination by a conspiracy involving the Memphis police as well as federal agencies."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.#Coretta_Scott_King_v._Loyd_Jowers)

And also [here](http://www.thekingcenter.org/assassination-conspiracy-trial). 




 Yeah, he has a bunch of good stuff on youtube. 




 Im with you. Because Carr would get a synergy with Cooper. We have untapped potential with Carr that Cooper could help realize. If we didnt have Carr, Id be more inclined to go with Williams. Too bad we only get one. 




 Wow. He is telling pickers 1-3 something. More than an implication.  




 Duncan is 39.  I'd take 2 or 3 or 8 impressive blocks, and the many non-shots they cause (which stats don't account for) by a young player, than 1 random block by a 39-year-old any day.  But whatever it takes for Spurs fans to get excited. 




 Exactly. 









 They say "disrupting" like it's a bad thing. 




 Well maybe it was just an accident then. 




 Yes, and I've heard some say that Williams is overhyped.  No one has said that about Cooper.  If anything, they say he's underappreciated.  Sure, that is hearsay, but means something. 









 DeAndre Jordan does this about 8 times a game.  Tim Duncan does it once in a series, and people act like it's the second coming of Christ.   




 This is exactly what I've been saying.  Draft Cooper.   




 NBA needs to hold them fucking accountable. It is not "just part of the game".   




 He whines. Then we see the replay of him and two others taking Blake's head off.  




 I like DJ, but he has to get it together. 




 Yeah, I don't think any of them are Swedish.  




 Yeah fuck him and the NBA for not fining him already. And Parker too. *All they do is flop!* 

But we need to close out games!  Make a freaking free throw too!

That's 2 games we've handed them now. 

EDIT: And fuck you too refs. You do this for a living? What a horribly called game.  




 When is the NBA going to fine Ginobili for flopping? This is beyond ridiculous.  




 I should mention: If you read Kierkegaard, I would start with 'Concluding Unscientific Postscript' then 'Fear and Trembling', or the reverse.  




 Goodell would then investigate it for 3-30 months, and personally destroy all evidence of a delay.  




 It is the internet. Thre is room enough for everything.  




 Yeah. They're thinking about it. For now.  




 Fuck Goodell. 




 To me, it isn't about the weed.  It should be legal.  It's a plant, etc.  But it's about being stupid.  Don't do nonsense like that *especially* before the draft.  No, we shouldn't take him.  And Reg is not the type of guy to see value there. 




 Yeah. And OP's first instinct was to feel sorry for him being a closeted gay? Right.  




 This is excellent.  The Bleacher Report may have a commitment to excellence.  

I'm going back and forth, and forth, on Williams/Cooper/White.  I tend to end on White or Cooper because we could then better realize Carr's potential.  But then they got Crabtree, so are they thinking this isn't as much of a need.  Then I remember Reg is a former LB, so maybe he prioritizes defense somehow.  

I want Williams *and* either Cooper or White.  Too bad we only get one.  I guess I'd be most happy if Reg saw it my way and got a receiver.  But if he didn't I'd be OK too maybe. 




 It's a cop-out because you can't handle it.  The government you advocate is the same government that built the big banks, along with Fannie and Freddie, the Fed, etc., which led to the bubbles, and the bail outs, which led to *no one* going to jail.  They are the same government that already taxes corporations more than most other countries, taxes the rich far more than the poor, *and* writes the loop-holes for them to hide most of that money in.  The powerful (be they the rich, the banks, or the government) like money for themselves, not for you or me. 




 Exactly.  And it explains why anarchists/libertarians have trouble organizing (if we are to see that as "trouble").  Natural freedom entails what appears to be disagreement, but is only difference.  The words keep us apart, because we get fixated on them instead of human-heartedness.  To continue the example of politics:  Democrats and Republicans group themselves in opposition to each other based around artificial concepts, platform planks - pro-this, anti-that - which have nothing to do with real reality.  So they are in perpetual war for their own supposed benefit.  Gay marriage, for instance: Why is any kind of marriage anything more than an agreement between two people, or between two or howevermany whatever?  The powers that be have seized on this artificial issue to the detriment of us all. 




 You're most welcome.  You saw Watts in person, or recordings, or how?  "Tao: The Watercourse Way" changed the way I see the world.

I think you'll enjoy those books!   




 Close.  I'm saying (among other things) that it shouldn't be demanded or expected that anyone trust a scientist or an expert.  That's not good science. 




 Respectfully:  What you lack in substance you make up for with footnotes, and verbiage.  I can give you 8 ways in which black and white resemble each other.  And I can give you 8,000 ways in which SK was anti-Hegelian, and use primarily SK's own statements, not those of academics who enjoy the trees more than the forest.  You are aware of this.  Certainly you aren't suggesting that SK and Hegel are similar. 




 don't worry i'm just an anonymous guy on the internet.  

but you ought to put your money where your mouth is and pay even *more* than you are required to in taxes.  but you don't.  so you aren't as much of a true believer as you'd like us to think. 




 Hogwash.  Praise be to Almighty Science....er, peer review.  Ignorance of experts on full display here.  Why such zeal and dogma?  Where is your skepticism?  Why make a judgement call?  Why not hold global warming as a provisional possibility?  We haven't even gotten to whether it is caused by man or not.  If it is naturally occurring, apart of man, or not.  Or the question of if it is happening, in this giant universe, why the necessity for alarm as if we humans can do anything good to save ourselves.  All our saving of ourselves has only resulted in more wars, theft, etc.  I think it was a scientist who said if bugs go, life on the planet will have about 50 years, but if humans go, life on the planet will thrive.  So the enlightened are supposed to save us from ourselves?  So the tyrants who spout what they want to to justify taking our money for their own benefit are going to save us???  Get real.  

So at least you admit that consensus can be wrong.  You don't hear that from the rest though.  And even you say that if you have a "convergence of data", it is very unlikely to be wrong.  Oh the chances are slim.  I see.  Again you drift into non-science really fast.  If you guys are all talking about likelihood, then say so.  If this is a Pascal's wager thing, say so.  But none of you do.  You say it is happening, and anyone can see it, even though no one can see the data or interpret it properly, etc.  This is how you don't do your cause any service.  But you are the enlightened one, adored by academics and the tyrants.  Make a fucking prediction.  What's the temperature going to be in 10 years?  Al Gore should be able to put $1,000,000 on it.  I'm sure someone would take his bet.  But you can't even tell me the temperature next week.  But that's probably because I'm not a scientist.  

All the great scientists had skepticism and doubt and uncertainty, and were certain of their own ignorance, perceptions, etc.  They even doubted the fucking data.  NONE of the climate change zealots EVER express this.  They are religious extremists.

EDIT:  Nothing personal.  I don't want to be this harsh.  Forgive me.
 




 Here are the [reading lists](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/graduate/master-s-liberal-arts/reading-lists/).

Henry Hazlitt - [Economics in One Lesson](https://mises.org/library/economics-one-lesson)

Irwin Schiff - [How an Economy Grows and Why It Doesn't](http://freedom-school.com/money/how-an-economy-grows.pdf)

[Fredric Bastiat collection](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/The%20Bastiat%20Collection_4.pdf)
Including "The Law", which you should read too.

Murrary Rothbard - [What Has Government Done to Our Money?](https://mises.org/library/what-has-government-done-our-money) Maybe read this first.  Incredible book.

Ludwig von Mises - [Human Action](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Human%20Action_3.pdf)  The first books are short.  This one is long.

I don't know any good nutrition books.  Just wish I had learned it. 

Regarding philosophy:  I would start with the existentialists, and among them Soren Kierkegaard.  Because he was such an incredible philosopher, but also because his philosophy, and that of the rest of the existentialists, is so human.  It is not abstract, is not about concepts exclusively.  It will engage you and bring you in.  A lot of philosophy is difficult when initially confronted by a novice - but not always.  Also read the philosophy on the St. John's list.  Those are the basics.  Perhaps Plato and Aristotle most basic.

[Lao Tzu](http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Lao-Tzu/dp/014044131X) (Tao Te Ching) and [Chuang Tzu](http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Chuang-Penguin-Classics/dp/014045537X) are the 2 basic Taoist texts.  Dating from 600-400 BC.  They are poetic and beyond words, literally and figuratively.  It would also provide a basis for other philosophy reading, though Taoism is not per se a philosophy or a religion.  Plus, it is eastern so it has a different angle.  Many parallels between Taoism and existentialism.  But read these alongside Alan Watts' ["Tao: The Watercourse Way"](http://www.amazon.com/Tao-The-Watercourse-Alan-Watts/dp/0394733118).  It might blow your mind.  Excellent stuff.  And not esoteric at all.


 




 You need some training in basic epistemology.  It isn't a "hard science", but give it a try.  

The point with Galileo, which you probably get anyway, is that the *established consensus was wrong!*.  In your world, the "consensus" can't be wrong, and ignorance doesn't exist.  Let alone the questions of what a consensus is, who establishes it, etc.  You try to dismiss my example and say that they weren't scientists, that Galileo was the "first scientist".  What unscientific, purely rhetorical, nonsense!  "Considered by many" ?????  You and your ilk can keep parroting this considered-by-many delusion as fact in some way, but not only is it meaningless, it is misleading and *unscientific*.  

You argue against yourself when you say that no one but Galileo was a scientist in his time, so all the naysayers get a pass.  But nowadays you heap scorn on all the non-scientists if they don't take on faith what is supposedly established as consensus, though not 100% of course.  Because how are they supposed to process all that data and evidence, if it is so difficult for real scientists to do it?  Oh, by faith.  I see.  Now it's a religion.  Consensus becomes herd mentality.  Science is determined in the comments on reddit.  If I agree with you I understand how science works.  If I don't, I don't.  I'm afraid you don't understand how science works.  

If global warming is happening, you aren't making any good fucking argument for it.  You're making a pathetic, unintentionally unscientific argument not to listen to a goddamn word you say.  

One simple question for you:  Can the consensus be wrong? 

EDIT:  By the way, what's the consensus now?  Is it 90% or 95%?  Unlike with temperatures, the exact number is hard to determine.  Maybe we should just find out what the consensus on the consensus is. 




 i think they know all leaders (of this sort especially) are of strong choleric temperament, and thus extroverted.  so they skew our results to show we aren't too far from that. 




 Innovation will flourish when the government monster dies.   




 Mao. It said I was more extrovert than introvert. Dead wrong. Heck, all these leaders are more extrovert than introvert, by a long shot.  




 I know, I know. The state is all right.  




 Wow. All that is is SK showing some respect for a guy and maybe for the magnitude of his ideas.  Not agreeing with what his ideas actually were. And certainly not espousing them. The last "despite" quote really shows it. At least you included it.  




 Is Galileo in the 95% or the 5%?  Surely none in your 95% are there because people like you would ridicule them if they weren't. Surely none of them are there because they wouldn't get tenure otherwise.  Oh, but we are all for individual radical geniuses, unless they diverge from the "consensus", right?  One shouldn't have to take science on faith, or by Pascal's wager.  




 Sure most people would say SK is anti-Hegel.  And we would know what they mean. In some circles, where people fear being seen as too simple, perhaps they would elaborate. Usually not here on reddit though. 

Like with a lot of philosophy there are layers and there are indirect influences.  And there are contrarian books out there for everything. 

But to say SK was not anti-Hegel is the point that is untrue on its face, and only might be partially true with serious explanation, none that could be derived from what SK himself said, however.  




 Yeah, it matters. Particularly the part about admitting uncertainty. Something we didnt hear from Obama on Earth Day or from most pop scientists today. 

You, in your zeal and righteous indignation, try to come down on me for a quote made by someone else. Something deep inside you must have been triggered. It is this kind of reflexive animal religiousity that is a threat to rationality and real science. And, like any religion, entails massive hypocrisy and denial.  




 Check out the reading list for St. John's College. It is online. 

For economics: 
'Economics in one lesson' by Henry Hazlitt
'The seen and the unseen' by Fredric Bastiat
'Human action' by Ludwig von Mises
'How an economy grows and why it doesn't' by Irwin Schiff

Read philosophy

Read nutrition

Read the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu
Read the Book of Chuang Tzu 
 




 I hope we get this guy unless Reg decides to trade.  




 Green's been pretty effective on D though.  Kawhi might be my favorite non-Clipper player in the league.  Just plays, and it speaks for itself.  He's pure.  A team player, but steps up when he needs to.  Good with the ball, good away from the ball, excellent at defense.... 




 Not bad for a guy who can't jump, or switch directions very fast.  He played well.  He's solid and it worked. 




 Way to play son!!!! 









 ....followed by a flop and a flail.... 




 1.  I would have to assume that this author makes a point based on substance.
2.  I would have to assume that the book description is wrong when is says the book is about SK's problem with Danish Hegelians, not Hegel himself.  
3.  I'm sure I could find 10 books that say the opposite of what this does.

EDIT:  And this guy doesn't seem to be saying "yes and no".  He seems to be saying no. 




 Im surprised by how little discussion there is about how much we need a receiver, or not. If we do, it is a no-brainer we take Cooper (or White).  Seems to me it is that simple.  




 No. This one is a different version/translation.  




 Exactly. Oooooh they're so classsssy.  









 All Parker and Ginobili do is flop or flail into the lane trying to draw a foul.  




 Oh, because the food is shitty in Denver.  




 Keep moving /r/environment.  Nothing to see here.  It doesn't exist if you don't see it.  Now move along. 




 In Denver or at Casa Bonita? 




 Could you elaborate on Thomas Cleary, how he has appropriated it? 




 Read "the seen and the unseen" by Fredric Bastiat. The issue isnt whether innovation happens. The issue is that potential innovation doesnt happen (the unseen) because of insane and impossible barriers to entry imposed by the tyrants.  




 "Science is belief in the ignorance of experts." ~Richard Feynman 




 How do you know the sky is blue?  If you take a cursory look at the news, check any measure you like. 




 Especially because we need a good receiver. And because we have Carr, and need to realize his potential. 

It doesnt mean much if we get a much better defense and dont improve our offense from last year. We need weapons. 

And Im not as convinced as others about Leonard either.  




 Because it is grounded. 
Because it has to do with people and with life. Not just abstract esoteric concepts that only have significance in school, if anywhere.  




 Yeah I got into Taoism several months ago and noticed the same things you did. I recommend 'The Book of Chuang Tzu', the Penguin version. A good complement/supplement to the TTC. Lots of rich stuff there. I find Taoism to be very refreshing and rejuvenating. 

Did you ever read Kierkegaard?  

I think Woody Allen addresses existentialism in most of his movies. A lot of the humor comes from the absurdity of life. Also, 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' is very Taoist-existentialist. 




 Deconstructing Harry
Cuckoo's Nest 




 thanks! 




 Yes, you got it.  Not so sure about everyone else here though. 




 "Lack of medical care" is police-speak for "We broke his neck.  What are you gonna do about it?" 




 **Keys to the Game**

The Spurs defense is messing with our flow.  They are picking CP3 up at just across half court.  CP3 has to work to get around it just to the 3 point line to get the offense going, get a pass off, dribble anywhere.  And they give him different looks with Green and Leonard switching it up. It takes precious time off the shot clock if nothing else.  Hence, we haven't been rotating, cutting, moving, creating opportunities like usual.  When CP3 moves and passes, we are much better.  This should be obvious.

Blake can't be defended by any single Spur.  He needs to just dribble down to the post and shoot a bunny every time, or turn around and make a move.  He will either make a shot, get fouled, or pass to someone else open if he gets doubled.  But last night he didn't do this.  Heck, Splitter is playing him like a little bug.  

Barnes needs to cover Leonard like a blanket.  Don't help anyone else out.  Stay less than one arm's length from Leonard *at all times*.  Don't let him *receive* a pass.  Don't let him touch the ball.  It can be done.

Reddick and/or Barnes and/or Crawford need to be on.  When these guys all have an off night, or even 2 of them have an off night, we struggle big time.  

In the off-season we need to acquire a serious bench.  Hedo, Big Baby, and Spencer Hawes can barely even run.  They seriously look like they are in some geriatric condition, hobbling around everywhere.  And Baby shoots the most blockable shot in the world.  Hedo - at least he does no harm.  Remember when we had Eric Bledsoe, Caron Butler, Lamar Odom....? 




 Two words:  Jamarcus Russell. 




 Pretty much anything has had its counter throughout history, whether legitimate or not, especially in academia and religion.  I haven't come across any criticisms, and I find this itself to be a bit surprising and unique. 




 I agree, but has anyone attempted this misguided effort? 




 Oh....Ouch.  That's the same defense Kobe gives when anyone brings up the fact that his personality has broken up good teams, and is generally bad for team chemistry, and thus prevents (more) success:  "Look at my rings!!!  I gots rings.  They cover a multitude of sins, don't they?"

What about all the rings he and Shaq don't have but should have? 




 Are you saying there is proof the Patriots deflated those balls? 




 What is it with LSU?  If I were a GM in any sport, I'd make a rule never to draft anyone from there.  Even the stars, like Shaq, are underachievers.  At least since Pete Maravich. 




 Are there any criticisms of Taoism?  If so, what are they? 




 So Spurs fans are OK with "flashy" play after all?  Up until now that sort of thing has been frowned upon. 




 Was it really over Blake Griffin? Looks to me like Griffin was about 5' away and never even challenged him.  




 Sexual relations is different than rape. Woods got treatment for sexual addiction. Clinton is a horn dog. Sure women lie. I sure tend to belive them here. i could be wrong but I dont think so. Ive read their accounts and the ones Ive read arent made up. What money are they getting? What point is there in casting doubt where there is no reason to. We all have a measure of realistic doubt with this stuff automatically. That gets influenced by the evidence or lack if it.  




 Cuckoo's Nest
Shawshank Redemption
Sling Blade
Platoon

The new Netflix series Bloodline is incredible.  




 Self-inflicted hair cut.  




 Focus on the tasks at hand. Lead through competence (that is the way INTJs tend to lead). When you dont know, admit it. Dont act. Treat people with respect. Let people follow their abilities and instincts.  Dont play favorites. Dont posture. Dont condescend. Have fun. 




 Man, I like Carr. Hope he and Crabtree - and Cooper - can do it this year.  




 I cant think of any other instance of 40 or so women coming out of the woodwork like this.  




 Yeah, and OJ isn't guilty either. Im all for 'innocent until proven guilty'. Ive spent time in jail due to lying cops. But there is a difference between my opinion and a legal conviction, which he probably won't get due to the statute of limitations.  




 i know. barnes should smother him at all times. everywhere.  i mean no more than two feet away.  




 We gotta finish close games off. 

We cant let their D stop and hold our offense. They we're picking us up just across half court and it would take another 8 seconds to start the offense. CP3 needs to get the ball to the three-point line quick and start moving around. 

If we run and push the ball it will work in our favor. 

We gotta make free throws down the stretch.  




 Rape a few and they throw you in jail.  Rape a lot and they defend you. 




 Marxism was largely dependent on Hegel.  Kierkegaard was anti-Hegel.  




 Thanks!  (I just returned to this thread and saw this.) 




 What is the total count now? 









 Yes and no. Depends on the corporation and one's direct supervisors. When things go bad, they go really bad.  




 /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut

/r/Taoism 




 How should we treat others?  What about empathy?  How should we console a sad child?  Why do children get sad at an age before they have even differentiated between good and bad, fortune and misfortune, etc.?

And I would say that disharmony with the Tao isn't a good thing. 









 TL;DR 




 Yeah, we idealize someone. Then when we meet them we realize they are a real human being, and it's a big turn off.  




 How would we know?  Since there wasn't any coverage.  Oh, are we believing the stats the police give us? 




 That hurt.  But we'll still win the series. 




 Spurs making a conscious effort to guard us at the 3 point line and beyond. CP3 getting around it for now though. He's going to need some help from Barnes and Reddick. Gonna need some 3's this game.  









 The Chuang Tzu is the best for these questions.  It addresses people as really human (human heartedness) and the questions of whether or how to improve things in the world.  It tells what the sage would do or not do.  Most of it comes down to wisdom and seeking harmony, not coercion, not impatience.

EDIT:  In other words, the answers like "What is there to improve?" don't *really* get it.  There is substance to Chuang Tzu's writings.  His book was longer than a reddit comment. 




 I don't know why, but it just wasn't that substantive, seems to use a lot of words and isn't very direct or simple.  Alan Watts is the best for explaining Taoism to anyone. 




 yes. very good.  




 If it rhymes, you'll do time.  




 ive never heard it put that way before. but now that you mention it, i get exactly that way too. all my "pessimism" has to do with people. everything else is a welcome challenge.  




 Yeah, this kicks the other one's ass.  And I think the Japanese will especially like it! 




 Assuming your stats are true, why don't those officers lose their jobs for misconduct?  Why are they protected?  Why do they get paid time off when their conduct is being "investigated" by their friends?

And given the amount of systematic cover-up that exists, if we are relying on stats reported by the police, then certainly they aren't true.
 




 You must not have looked very closely at /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut  Only a few new cases of brutality?  You're a liar.
[And try this.](http://killedbypolice.net/)

Please *don't* become a cop.  Judging by your post history, you like Grand Theft Auto.  Being a cop isn't a game, where you get to live out your fantasies of street justice and run around chasing "bad guys" with your buddies and all your expensive cool gear.

 




 I think so too. 




 You are quite naive.  




 What a load of shit.  Pure shit.  You guys are very well paid. All kinds if benefits, time off, insane pensions, paid leave when you kill someone, police union pays your attorney, fellow officers wont testify against you.  You are all a bunch of goddamn frat boys.  Sacrifice?  Fuck you.  




 If there are good cops out there, why dont they speak out against their murdurous colleagues? All - yes, all - police unions are corrupt. We have an epidemic of police abuse and cover up. Check out r/bad_cop_no_donut and see for yourself.  People getting KILLED everyday for doing nothing. Then the DA's dont prosecute. And we have the prisons full and overflowing with non-violent offenders. The US justice system is fucked up.  









 Yeah it is excellent.  




 The Timmy is what cracked me up even more. But I dont know why.  




 ive noticed many people have a laugh reflex when watching supersick stuff.  twisted.  









 Wow. Fucking Horrible.  Depressing.  Keep the uni's you have.  They are far better than this shit. 




 There were definitely bad calls, but they were on both sides and not gazillions of them I thought. Compared to what could have been.  




 I dont call flops and dives and hacks classy.  




 Yeah we need a bench. What if the refs call a bad game and we get in foul trouble?   




 Yeah did you see all the times they passed up close shots just because DJ was there? Too bad there isnt a stat for that.  




 I know what you mean, but to me they are just quiet, not classy, except for Pop. The reason is that Ginobili and Parker flop way too much. Ginobili is always looking to draw a foul rather than just playing.  




 Magic Johnson 




 Linear TV stopped about 20 years ago.  




 i know. my comment didnt come across as i meant it.  




 Yes, thats my point.  




 I read Rand. Didnt make it through any of the books because the writing was horrible. But I read her. Academic popularity is for sissies.  














 Ginobili going into flop mode a little earlier than expected.  









 there is something in ch. 2 of Chuang Tzu. about not wasting one's energy with others who dont get it because they wont get it. it is referring to leaders and authorities, but still applies. there are probably other references too. 

i try to tell myself to let the substance of what i am saying speak for itself and not be wedded or identified with what i am saying. if i say it, that i will be ok with however it is received, knowing that its reception isnt up to me at all, but only to say it. people are really up against reality and not against me. i try to present it as impersonally as possible. not to say that this is always how i do it though.  




 ....plus Photoshop.  




 yeah i like variety. i like a lot of things and can usually do whatever i put my mind to. but i get bored sometimes. or dont find satisfaction in actually following through and making it real. sometimes just the idea is enough. That said, I do different things all the time and see a lot of them through. I enjoy the challenge.  




 Ive been there. One thing I had to realize is that existence doesnt mean stasis. Things grow and change and learn. 

I would highly recommend checking out Taoism. Discovering it has done wonders for me. The two primary texts are The Tao Te Ching and The Book of Chuang Tzu. But also get The Watercourse Way by Alam Watts as a primer. Taoism shares much with existentialism, but not everything. It is not a religion or philosophy. Essentially, it is the way of nature. Becoming aware of it has helped me realize my place in the world, and helped rid me of existential angst, etc. Anyway, I cant do it justice here, but very strongly recommend it.  




 I can vouch for character concerns in Oakland. Drove through there 3 weeks ago. Parked for 2.5 hours. Got truck broken into and $11k worth of stuff stolen.  




 He puts his shorts on one leg at a time, just like the rest of us. But that was 16 years ago.  




 not really. not the worst thing ever though. the deer appears to have puffy cheeks even. NBA teams should be able to get the best graphic artists, or artists of any kind, in the world. NBA owners and execs have no aesthetic taste is the real problem.  




 yeah. goes to show you cant just copy-paste. 














 Yeah, Oregon doesn't see a difference between spending public money (without consent) and a company spending its own money. Because they know better, and it is for your own good.  









  and everyone was lauding the new redesign for the bucks.  that was a joke too.  why is it that european soccer teams can do it, but americans can't? 




 where do they get these horrible graphic designers? ridiculous.  




 thanks, to say the least. 

im leaning toward cooper or white because they would make carr better able to reach his potential. by getting a WR we tap into that synergy they would have with carr. it is a synergy that would otherwise remain underutilized, if carr doesnt have a WR weapon. though we did just get crabtree, i think the point still stands. looking forward to see what reggie does. we have a lot of good options.  




 The estate tax is one of the worst of many bad taxes.  I don't care how rich you are.  It's basically: you're dead, so what do you care, and what can you do about it?
