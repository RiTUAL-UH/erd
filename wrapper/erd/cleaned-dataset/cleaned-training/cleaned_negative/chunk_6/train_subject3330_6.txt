 Thanks, but i'm going to grab the physical copy. 




 At 65Gb... Even if they offered pre load a month early, I still wouldn't be able to play it on release. 

Curse Australian data caps and shit speeds. 




 There are dozens of us! DOZENS! 




 Hell, they could just cut in old footage of Depp from the previous 4 movies and it'd still be "minimally impacted"

 If you think about the game you lose "the game".  

If listening to the game makes you think of "the game" then yes, you lose. 

But if listening to the game does not make you think of the game then you don't lose the game because your thinking about the game, not "the game"

Get it? 




 Heh, in Australia we use Picoprep - Sodium picosulfate.

Tastes like acid and makes you shoot clear water like a geyser in no time. 




 Jade Cocoon. It was like Pokemon but better.

 




 No, farfetched is a Pokemon. 




 Like darude in the sandstorm... 




 Close. But its about a 26 year difference. 




 It grows on you... well it does on me. 




 Hahahaha, awesome. Thanks for that. 




 well it's called Aotearoa for a reason. 









 They're... they're made of meat?  




 This guy is a fucken knobend, couldn't make it past 30 seconds. 




 Its called Munchausen syndrome.

People like attention and will go to strange lengths to get it. 




 Happened to me as well, I left it that way. 

Fuck em. 




 Whoa, hey, settle down there Cthulhu. 




 ? 




 I dont have the skill for the idea, but Street Fighter.... Chuck could be Guile about to do a Flash Kick and the other guy could be E Honda doing his Hundred Hand Slap move...

Any taker? 




 I love how some people are so creative they have time, vision and ability to do stuff like this. 

And here I am on reddit all day while at work, only occasionally participating in psbattles... poorly. 




 Good luck? 

*Pulls out a toxic, electrically charged, flame covered short sword*

Who needs luck? 




 Main issue for me is the controls, using the rear touchpad for reload / grenade was a poor choice... 

When its hectic they're unresponsive, you pretty much need to swipe the entire back pad instead of a quick flick. 

I find myself having to swipe quite a few times to even reload and also throwing grenades at my feet because of this.

They should patch in the ability to remap controls. 

Other than that is not too bad.  




 No comment. 




 I took this photo 3 years ago at a random art gallery when I visited Perth.

Not that I didnt try to find the artists details, I did credit the art gallery in various posts. 

The artist himself has since messaged me and I have amended my posts to credit them directly.

But thank you for your input. 




 Which means there was always a chicken nearby,  watching... waiting... 




 If anyone wants to try to find the decks or the artist, hit up Ihart productions.

Well played and awesome video.

 And rightly so.

It came out in 2010... 




 That's an aluminum stockpile, the owner is likely saving them to cash in later.

 comparable to early DVDs

Sums it up perfectly, though some Laserdisc titles  are superior to their DVD counterpart due to there being no compression artifacts / blocking caused by digital compression on early (even someof the later) DVDs. 




 I have a few players laying around I keep for parts and one I actually use.  









 Also the Tuatara in NZ. 




 I liked Moira, she served a purpose and was always upbeat. Felt bad the first time I nuked Megaton... 

Never understood the hate undue for her.  




 [Nice try Skynet](http://i.imgur.com/MPhCbpB.jpg)

Edit: [Default restore](http://i.imgur.com/Z6LwZ7R.jpg), if someone else wants to try with the brightness / contrast. 




 Yeah 5 mins if that. Zoom in and you'll see how the colours are all outside the lines.

But if you're happy with it, thanks XD

 I've played enough Resident Evil to know that swapping those two stones around will reveal a key... Probably one with a shield etched on one side. 




 [They Live]( http://www.cultofvhs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/theylive21.jpg) is still [Relevant as ever.]( http://i.imgur.com/RsrSFr3h.jpg) 

Minus the Alien world domination plot of course... 




 Translation :

We've made our many back from the full game and believe that any consumers that were going to try the PS+ version have since gone to purchase the game. 

Those who haven't purchased it yet... will. Because fuck you, we're Sony.

 Move the cat to the position you would like, then erase the part of the cat that is overlapping. 

Changing the opacity / transparency of the cat will help you to see where the cat and person meets.

Hope this helps. 




 Really not sure where I was going with [this one](http://i.imgur.com/zoA3Hnt.jpg)...

 One black layer normal, opacity set at 56.

Another black layer set as an overlay with opacity at 44.

I'm using PIXLR though as I'm at work and dont have access to PS.

 Fuck yeah, I'd imagine the movie being like Taken, only on the high seas... 

Imagine a dark, gritty Popeye while he hunts down Bluto who has abducted Olive Oil... While killing countless sailors/pirates along the way.

 THANKS OP!

Eh, I'm in Australia, we use the proper date format like you so no stress there. 




 GIVE US THE FILES OP AND NOBODY GETS HURT 




 In Australia as well. 




 I went into settings then system software update, it downloaded and installed.

Edit:

Turns out the update has locked me out of all digital content. Everything has the padlock symbol  and has the error "cannot use the content. Cannot connect to the server to validate the license."
CE-33950-0

Cant browse the internet on the ps4 either, another error: "Cannot connect to the Internet" CE-33991-5

Cant access the store... another error: "An error occurred" SU-30709-9

Either psn is down or the update is fucked

Edit 2: After an hour everything's resolved itself, psn is back up and full access to everything restored. 




 All aboard the Douche-Canoe! 




 Those Nuns, always playing with [yellow snow](http://i.imgur.com/BK3u7nl.jpg) 




 It's all about progress not perfection, you're getting close to the later though, keep it up. 




 Snap, guess I was way off. Thanks. 




 It has plenty of good console quality games, along with PS2 and PS3 ports. 

Granted Sony has all but dropped support for the western market and relegated it to an indie and remote play device... On the Eastern side though, there are more JPRGs and the like than you can shake a stick at if that's your shtick.

But again, point being it has console quality games on it.
 




 PS Vita? 




 Yeah you can wait in game and screw around in the tower till it's fully downloaded. Or you can go play something else etc.

If you go back to the home menu and press the option button on the Dying Light menu item then go to information / details you will see the file size downloaded / remaining. 




 Pre install is like 5 or 6GB, the full game is 16GB

You need the full game to be downloaded before you can progress past the intro / elevator. 




 I havent played it myself, but Lords Of The Fallen seems to be what you are looking for? 




 Not sure how that would intimidate... I see that and think "Well theres a guy with extra weight and limited mobility, easy target"

Then again, I know nothing about war now let alone back then. 




 I've seen this [movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1031280/)... RIP OP's sister. 




 Good afterble constanoon. 




 Squaresoft... Those were the days. 




 Guess this was inspiration for [The Homer](http://i.imgur.com/nOI10tR.jpg) 




 So... Fallout New Vegas wasnt too far off with the Cazador... 




 It's the From Dusk Till Dawn of Sci-Fi movies... 

As in the drastic change of pace and themes in the third and fourth act.
