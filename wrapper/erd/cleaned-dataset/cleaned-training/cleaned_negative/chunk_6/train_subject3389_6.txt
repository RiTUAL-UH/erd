 First, you are cherry picking. Oils outperformed the SPX in 2001-2011, but often lagged before and have definitely lagged since. 

Second, that was then. The global scientific community (all 97 national scientific academies, the UN IPCC, etc.) delivered the verdict on leaving most fossil fuels unburned only last year. The Saudi dumping of oil followed that announcement, not coincidentally. Meanwhile, coal stocks have been in decline for five years, and European utils are selling off their coal-fired generation businesses. This is no longer the *new* reality, but just the reality. 














 Did you check the MSCI link? Fossil-free indexes have been outperforming the S P for the past five years. That's the reality that exists. 




 All true, but most of the rest of the world is [driving up](http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2014/01/14/beef_prices_chart.jpg) beef and pork prices as fast as they can. 




 Anyone who thinks these universities would endanger their endowments' performance by excluding fossil fuels, [see this](https://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-acwi-ex-fossil-fuels-index-gbp-gross.pdf). 




 Based on data like [this comparison](https://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-acwi-ex-fossil-fuels-index-gbp-gross.pdf) and [this](https://www.aperiogroup.com/resource/138/node/download), combined with the fact that the entire world scientific community now tells us that we must quit fossil fuels entirely within little more than a generation to avoid running insane climate risks, isn't it time to get out of oil, coal and gas stocks?

I've made this a cornerstone of my stock portfolio. Anyone else doing this?

 So, a small fraction of what we just spent to bail out the corporate banks and pull the world back from the brink of depression and war. Got it. 














 True. However, the takeaway for me is the article's comment from Michael Mann: "the U.S. still needs to create a larger gap between greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth". In other words, relying on market forces to solve this problem over time is woefully insufficient. 









 True. A better headline would be, "Finally, a conservative with morals the oil industry can't buy". 














 The "crash" has already begun, but it's more of a slow crumple, like a supertanker hitting the rocks at low speed.

[This analysis](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/10/fossil-fuel-free-funds-out-performed-conventional-ones-analysis-shows) shows the new market reality: stock indexes that include fossil fuels underperform those that don't. 




 None of the fossil fuel majors are doing squat to diversify into renewable energy. The few that even tried, such as Shell and BP, have backed away. CEOs and directors don't last long, so each has a strong incentive to maximize short-term shareholder return, and screw the future. 









 One item to watch: standing on the pedals too much--as in hill after hill--can lead to leg cramps on longer rides, particularly in hot weather. Try to stay in the saddle, keep a cadence, and hydrate. 
























 Theres a volcano in Alaska, Pavlov, that only erupts during the autumn and winter. The 10cm or 15cm rise in sea level during the winter months, when low pressure comes over, is enough to bend the crust and squeeze magma out. Thats an example of how tiny a change you need, he said.

Fascinating. Thanks for posting this. 




 We need people who know the science but can speak to their tribe. 

Bingo. 




 Except when economists provide cover for pillage and political prostitution. There's *always* campaign cash in those. 




 A fanatic's first reaction to failure is always to insist that the policies tried weren't *pure* enough, so they need to be doubled.  







































 To be fair, Repubs have two approaches--tax cuts and deregulation--but only one ultimate goal: destruction of government. 




 "Washington State photon torpedoed the idea faster than a Borg could mutate."

Hah! 




 Ian, have you looked into the impact of raising cattle and cattle feed in California? [This Bloomberg article](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-13/cows-suck-up-more-of-california-s-water-than-almonds) suggests that it is the top single drain on California water supplies, yet it seems to get little attention.  




 "First, the government should eliminate energy subsidies of all kinds  for fossil fuels as well as renewable energy."

A very false precondition. "The government" cannot level the playing field by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, because the vast majority of them come from scores of *other* governments in developing countries; $550 billion annually. We would also have to eliminate much larger *indirect* subsidies such as public money for fossil fueled infrastructure such as highways, airports and utilities, not to mention the vast military costs of protecting oil fields and transport routes.

Fee-and-dividend carbon carbon taxes are beautiful things in themselves. However, until all the world's nations stop subsidizing fossil fuels, renewables will still need subsidies to compete. 




 Consider the alternative: coal, pollution from which is already killing or sickening millions worldwide, making fish inedible, and cooking the climate. Which is the greater risk? 




 Hey, if it walks like a demon, and it talks like a demon... 









 Shoot the messenger? Lomborg has been hired by a fossil fueled front man to spread doubt about the global scientific community's dire warnings that we must quit fossil fuels very, very soon. That is the story here.

Jotzo is hardly the only economist (or climate scientist) critical of Lomborg's profitable grandstanding: *every national scientific academy on Earth* officially disagrees with Lomborg.

However, the fossil fuel industry just can't get enough of him.  




 You have spent some time building those walls. I won't waste mine trying to break them down. 




 You want credible economists? The IPCC is full of them, and, as a body, they completely disagree with Lomborg, who is no economist at all. 




 Lomborg is more accurately what used to be called a mountebank. Someone who makes a career out of calling attention to himself.  




 Put another way, polluters have learned that buying media and experts to craft messages for it it is a worthwhile cost of doing business. 

PR toadies have responded by creating front groups like the Heartland Institute, which specializes in market research and messaging to divert attention from any harmful business, from tobacco to coal. For a painfully accurate, darkly funny inside look, see the movie, "Thank You For Smoking". 




 Out of sight, out of mind. 














 "These prices" are now low precisely because Saudi producers know they won't have many buyers in the future. It takes decades to deplete a large field. They're dumping product while they still can, and before carbon pricing begins to eat margins. 




 Haven't we all. However, I think one of the better things one can do for humanity is to raise a wonderful person or two. And I don't buy the doomsayer's argument that kids will merely inherit a hellhole of a planet. Not at all. Sure, climate is a challenge we must confront, but I'm reasonably sure we will do so, and it will be neither the last nor the largest challenge humans will face. (Just wait until synthetic biology and artificial intelligence get rolling!) 




 This should be titled "Large *American* cities ringed by car-dependent suburbs are less green". Most European cities are far greener. 




 Then at least pay for your trash: dumping tons of extra carbon into the atmosphere cannot remain subsidized by the rest of us. 




 Bury it in secure storage.

We simply don't have time to solve the climate problem without using *every* tool at our disposal. 




  I don't want to live in a city they are fucking dangerous.

Some cities are dangerous, many aren't. For examples, look at the top and bottom of [this list](http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings.jsp). It's largely a matter of wealth and how invested a city's inhabitants are in its continued wellbeing. Not too different from small towns and rural areas worldwide: some are placidly safe while others are dangerous, also due largely to wealth and emotional investment. 




 We lack time. The world scientific community tells us that we have exactly 27 years, at present trend, to quit fossil fuels altogether if we want to prevent running crazy risks to the climate, peace, prosperity, and the lives of millions. This is now an emergency, full stop. We must develop *every* clean energy source we have, and that includes nuclear. 

But don't take it from some random natterer online. [Listen to the experts.](http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/to-those-influencing-environmental-policy-but-opposed-to-nuclear-power/?_r=0) 




 Suburbs exist because massive government infrastructure spending and subsidies, along with free carbon pollution, *enabled* them to exist.  




  It's called quality of life.

Its called free riding.  




 What do oil reserves matter when at least half will need to stay in the ground to prevent climate catastrophe? 




 The car itself, even if electric, requires a [huge carbon footprint](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car).

Worse, the kind of living that a car enables--big, inefficient, detached homes with thirsty lawns and power machinery, where every errand requires a long drive to still other inefficient buildings, whose occupants *also* depend on driving--is the most carbon intensive by far; several multiples more so than city living. Needless to say, it is also highly water intensive, materials intensive, etc.. 




 If you need a car at all, you are placing a massive strain on resources. It's nearly impossible to live a suburban or rural life without doing so. 




 Then pay for the true cost of [400% more carbon pollution](http://e360.yale.edu/feature/greenest_place_in_the_us_its_not_where_you_think/2203/).  









 The best way to *prevent* an outcome like that may be to do just the opposite: forget the cabin and [stay in the city](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/22/earth-day-climate-change-column/26073883/). 




 Something else that does wonders for mental health is to join others who feel as you do, and raise your voices together in order to be heard. 

Citizen's Climate Lobby and 350.org are great for that, but nearly any environmental group will do. 
 




 Bleak? This is the most exciting, optimistic, important time to be alive that has ever existed, and I'm serious. 

As a species, we are overcoming warfare and injustice faster than ever before. Population growth will soon peak. Our grandchildren will live richer material, spiritual and intellectual lives than we do. 

We simply have this little climate problem to solve, which we can easily and affordably do, if we can just cooperate. Gaining that cooperation is the signature task of our time. So get to it! Just remember that you have two enemies in this fight who are determined to wear you down: one is named social inertia and the other is called the fossil fuel industry. Don't let either of those defeat you. 














 Ugh. If this blog lunatic had even *read* the Tyler Cowan article in question, rather than merely attacking its headline, he might have noticed its point: "Our more peaceful and  yes  more slacker-oriented world is in fact better than our economic measures acknowledge. Living in a largely peaceful world with 2 percent G.D.P. growth has some big advantages that you dont get with 4 percent growth and many more war deaths."

 Sulfates + water = sulfuric acid

Ocean acidification and acid rain are already massive problems that sulfate seeding would make much worse. 




 True, and the most cost-effective geoengineering scheme, sulfate spraying, will actually make ocean acidification and acid rain much worse. It's like a heroin junkie trying to compensate by smoking crack rather than by breaking their addiction.
 




 Lowering taxes on the owners of capital means shifting those burdens onto poorer taxpayers. Meanwhile, on current US trend, the benefits of any extra growth will go entirely to the rich.

Count me out. 




 1) Solar output peaks when much of demand does, during the afternoon air conditioning hours, so intermittency is less problematic than it may seem.

2) Battery storage costs are dropping quickly as well. For example, [this forecast](https://dqbasmyouzti2.cloudfront.net/assets/content/cache/made/content/images/articles/Storage_Cost_Drops_580_440.png) from three years ago actually *underestimates* the rate of improvement. 

3) While some think that solar or wind will be enough by themselves, most credible voices on the matter believe that we'll still need base-load generation from nuclear, biomass and the like. 




 Installation and other soft costs have rich opportunities to fall in the US. Those costs are [more than double](http://greenzone.co/2014/05/04/solar-pv-system-germany-roughly-50-cheaper-us/) what they are in Germany, and German companies are steadily lowering their costs as well. 














 Overcoming limited supplies of commodities is what human ingenuity does best. Don't bet on scarcity. 




  exponential modelling of any product is a fool's errand

So Moore's Law doesn't exist? Sometimes exponential product improvements *do* happen. In the case of solar PV, [Swanson's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson's_law) holds sway. It may not move at quite the speed of Gordon Moore's famous dictum, but the mechanics are similar.

 Four degrees warming isn't *likely* to cost more than half of Earth's people their lives, although it might. It would certainly crash the global economy, reduce the food supply and lead to much more warfare. If global nuclear war breaks out, it's goodbye civilization, and that means goodbye as well to the global infrastructure needed to feed billions.  




 They always are. Tribal hatred and all that. 




 Jeb Bush wants to represent a political party that gets fully 90% of the oil and gas industry's campaign money. Let's recall that his oily brother also acknowledged climate change while campaigning, then actively sabotaged and defunded climate science once in office.  




 And twenty years ago today, conservative fanatics killed 168, including an entire child care center, in the Oklahoma City bombing. Merely the worst of many deadly conservative attacks on America before and since. 

By contrast, the most notoriously violent socialist radical group of the 1960s, the Weather Underground, killed exactly one person. The Unabomber killed three. So much for left-wing terrorism. 




 If there was destructively irrational exuberance during Greenspan's tenure, it came primarily from raging libertarian egotists like him.

 Washingtonians and Oregonians have been battling Californian attempts to steal our water for generations. This is merely the first time they've brought Star Fleet to the fight. 




 But just try to insure those. 




 Better idea: rather than spending billions to move water from Washington to California, primarily to raise [cattle and their alfalfa feed](http://www.businessinsider.com/real-villain-in-the-california-drought-isnt-almonds--its-red-meat-2015-4), why not just raise the cattle and the feed in Washington where the water is now? 




 There are plenty of better places to grow water-intensive crops like alfalfa, almonds, pistachios, beef and rice than in the middle of a desert. 




 California has been trying to hijack the Northwest's water for generations, blithely ignoring the fact that Oregon and Washington fight over that water all the time, and they, too, are suffering from drought right now. 




  the ice has been melting for thousands of years because the earth has gradually been warming.

The Earth has actually been slightly, gradually [*cooling* for the past 8,000 years](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png), after reaching the interglacial peak. The past century's sudden rise looks like a wall on the right side of the temp chart. 














 Back when? 









 When did I say "painless"? You say that climate action, "involves simply taxing ourselves into economical and technological stagnation" and that "abandonment of fossil fuel use would bring about complete economic collapse". I simply quoted the global economic and scientific consensus that says your statements are completely untrue. Solutions are very *affordable*, but no one says they're free.

 




 There's the real objection: if the solution isn't painless, deny the problem. Rationalize it away. Foist it onto others. Shirk responsibility. 




 Upvote for all the above, although I suspect that dumping their oil before it is outlawed is a larger factor than most admit. After all, it takes many decades to really drain giant fields, future extraction technology will undoubtedly extend the life of those fields, and a global ban on burning oil is now inevitable, maybe even imminent. 

The only factor you haven't mentioned, and perhaps this qualifies as fresh thinking, is the degree to which the Saudi oil heartland is also the heart of the Kingdom's Shia population, and Sunni/Shia warfare is breaking out all over, so maybe the Saudis are also concerned about possible future national breakup and the loss of that territory. 




 Everyone's view of where "the other side" begins is relative to their own position on the political spectrum. Where do *you* stand? 









 The article's point is that continued global warming will lead to an economic crash which will then reduce the pace of further warming, although by that time both climate and economic conditions will be dire. 




 I do dismiss the left's solutions as they're often economically unsound

Which "left" is that? There's some range to consider. 




 Except that fossil fuels receive [$550 billion in annual subsidies](http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energysubsidies/), and have been heavily subsidized for generations. That $550 billion is about six times what renewables get, despite the fact that fossil fuels are the largest, richest industry on Earth, with well developed infrastructure that needs no assistance, and fossil fuels represent a global *problem* while renewables are a desperately needed *solution*.

That's the so-called "free market" you're defending. 




 You do realize that the IPCC is also comprised of economists, right?

I'll be moving along now. 




 Not only New Jersey. Coddling cops while attacking teachers has been Republican doctrine nationwide for at least a decade. 

Not hard to see why. More teachers are female, more cops are male. Teachers lean left, cops right. The GOP's geriatric base voters are worried about their own safety but indifferent about educating a generation they won't live to see. 




 Except that every national scientific academy, all 97 of them, agree that we must quit fossil fuels within 20-30 years at present trend, or climate damage will pose existential risks to civilization itself. How is the free market alone going to overcome the entrenched power of the world's largest industry *within that time window*? 




 Did I say that? No. So why did you? 




  I also agree with these scientists.

You agree with Idso, Ball, Lindzen, Singer, et al? Those are merely paid oil company shills singing for their supper, my friend. Others on the list, like McKitrick and Spencer, are conservative political ideologues.
 




  I'm skeptical of many populist solutions that involve simply taxing ourselves into economical and technological stagnation.

 "We cut renewable subsidies but not fossil fuel subsidies, and renewables lost ground to fossil fuels. Crikey!" 




 I certainly don't know what "Christians are for", do you? There's wide variation on that score. But I can easily see what *Christ* was for: sharing.

How is a voter who agrees to a tax for benefits to others not performing an act of charity? 




 It's much easier to calculate the cost of decarbonization, where variables are known, than to forecast future climate sensitivity where variables are less known. 




 I'm merely saying that Nordhaus's forecast represents the low end of a credible range, the high end of which is much, much higher.

Personally, [Weitzman](http://www.macalester.edu/~wests/econ231/Rev%20Environ%20Econ%20Policy-2011-Weitzman-275-92.pdf)   Wagner are more my breed of climate economists. 




 Rhetoric? No, scientific fact. It's called the [DICE model](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/documents/DICE_Manual_103113r2.pdf). 

You expected global climate risks to be cheery? 









  The climate changes during the pliocene are not well explained by carbon, it doesn't even account for a significant portion of the differential.

There is [little doubt](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n1/full/ngeo724.html) that elevated carbon levels during the pliocene accounted for a significant portion of the higher temperatures and higher sea levels then. And that was merely one of [many such ancient episodes](http://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/zachos08nat_141144.pdf) that provide insights into what a high-carbon atmosphere does to life on Earth. And, in each of these episodes, the impacts to precipitation have been highly uneven, boosting extremes--drier here, wetter there--just as we now see developing.

We agree on the need for action, and on the need for credibility, but let's settle down with the knee-jerk attacks. 




  See, there you go predicting doom if humans don't act soon to decarbonize. How can you be so certain of the stakes?

I'm not predicting anything. I'm simply paying attention to the united opinion of *all* of the world's major research bodies, which say we *must* decarbonize due to the extreme risks involved.

Here's an analogy: we now find ourselves playing Russian roulette, while forcing our children and grandchildren to play as well, all simultaneously, but we don't know with real certainty 1) how many bullets are in the guns, 2) at what part of our bodies the guns are aimed. We do know that, over the course of the next few decades, the number of bullets increases, as does the likelihood of the guns being aimed at our heads. Every decade is a pull of the triggers.

That makes the modest cost of decarbonization (0-2% GDP, net) an essential investment. 




 And Nicholas Stern says 6C could cost [20% of global GDP](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/Executive_Summary.pdf)--and that's before we consider the costs of ensuing global warfare, where all bets are off. Look at the global cost of the Syrian drought right now. Needless to say, there is quite a range of possible costs, but any of them would be far greater than the modest cost of prevention. 









 No, not very comforting. 




 1) Very few "predict doom", because most believe that humanity will act soon to decarbonize. The stakes are simply too high not to.

2) The plea to decarbonize isn't coming from "a scientist" or "just *some* scientists"; this is the united judgement of the entire world scientific community, including endorsements from every one of the world's 97 national scientific academies, the UN IPCC, the World Bank, NASA and just about every other research authority one can name.

3) The fact that we don't know with certainty what to expect is exactly why these organizations and individual experts are all so concerned. Their position is that the likelihood of absolute catastrophe is too high to ignore, and growing higher as we dither, so the only reasonable action is to "buy insurance" by investing in decarbonization now. 




 That's easy, because it has happened several times before and we have abundant evidence of the effects. 

For example, the [last time we had 400 ppm CO2](http://scienceblogs.com/significantfigures/index.php/2013/05/10/the-last-time-atmospheric-co2-was-at-400-parts-per-million-humans-didnt-exist/), as we now do, it led to sea levels more than 100 feet higher than today, global temperature 5F degrees higher than today, with large deserts in the North American Great Plains (complete with camels, no less). 

Let's just say that would now be highly inconvenient--except for the camels, which would be somewhat cool. Yet that was merely a moderate warming event, due to atmospheric carbon levels no higher than today's. [Much worse](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6231/229.full) have occurred. 




 Matthew 19:21 - "Go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven."

Luke 12:32-34 - "Sell your possessions, and give to the needy."

1 John 3:17 - "But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?"

Luke 3:10-11 - Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.

Acts 2:44-46 - "And all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need."

Acts 4:32-35 - "Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need." 

Luke 16:19-31 - There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side."

Etc., etc.. 




 All true, but nuclear meltdown is probably among the lesser worries, in my personal view, simply because the *last* thing any government will starve of water is a nuclear reactor; they can be powered down to reduce water consumption; and, even in the event of a meltdown, the damage is usually far more localized than that of war, drought, etc.. 




 The [last time the Earth had 400 ppm CO2](http://scienceblogs.com/significantfigures/index.php/2013/05/10/the-last-time-atmospheric-co2-was-at-400-parts-per-million-humans-didnt-exist/), as we now do, it caused the global average temperatures to rise to 3 to 4 degrees C warmer than today (5.4 to 7.2 degrees F), and polar temperatures to rise as much as 10 degrees C warmer than today (18 degrees F). The Arctic was ice free. Sea level fluctuated between 16 to 130 feet higher than today. Coral reefs suffered mass die-offs. Much of the North American Great Plains turned to desert and dry steppe, complete with camels. 

That's where *today's* 400 ppm is taking us, and never mind what the 550 ppm projected within fifty years would eventually do.  




 True, but it's a small quibble. Temuzjin's fears seem all too plausible. The idea that extreme warming will be delayed or prevented by global economic collapse due to moderate *near-term* warming is horrific. Because, as history shows, economic collapse leads quickly to the worst kind of warfare--which, these days, is as dangerous to civilization as anything a hotter climate can throw at us. 














 Meanwhile, low-cost oil producers like Saudi Arabia have responded by dumping their oil on the world market at half price, to unload their reserves before burning oil is outlawed and to delay the cost effectiveness of renewables.

That's the problem with fossil fuels: selfish-bastard nations with abundant fuel reserves can always undercut renewables if they choose, going by the logic that its better to sell those reserves now at low price than to see them stranded by the coming global bans.

The only solution is to ban these fuels sooner rather than later. The free market will *not* help. 









 The hardcore, unfailingly voting GOP base was born long before the 50s. 




 Millennials don't vote; fossils do. From a coldly calculating perspective, aren't Republicans shrewd to cater to cranky old reactionaries who *never* miss a chance to cast a ballot in every election from the Presidency down to the local school board, and to court lethal industries that most fear regulation?

There's only one solution, kiddos: vote, and organize your friends to vote.
 




 Agreed. This shows a race to scale up and consolidate in order to achieve bargaining leverage over labor, capital, vendors, retailers, you name it. 




 Hell *yes*! 




 "The government"? These subsidies are coming from scores of governments, mostly in developing countries. Very hard to control, hence the developed nations' subsidies for renewables to compete. 




  I don't understand why it would be viewed as a subsidy to the employer.

Because it rewards the worst-paying employers, lowering the floor for the lowest possible wages, speeding the race to the bottom.  




 Looks as if a Nestle boycott is gathering momentum over this, and not just among Californians. 

Nothing improves company reputation more than making yourself look like the greedy corporate bully in a lifeboat movie, guzzling all of the boat's water when the other passengers aren't looking.  









  I would like to see renewables take over without the help of government subsidies.

Wouldn't we all. However, fossil fuels are subsidized *six times* more than fossil fuels, despite being the richest industry of all time.  




 "Hey, maybe we can dump our oil on the market cheaply and sell the shit before it's outlawed, while delaying renewable energy so that we have more time to pump more carbon into the atmosphere!" 




 According to the IEA, we have only two years before a 2C rise is locked in. Time to make climate *the* central issue, whether elderly "perfect voters" are ready for it or not.  




 Been saying this for months: dumping oil on the the market is both a great way to drive out high-cost energy competitors (shale, renewables) and to sell more oil before carbon pricing and regulation kick in. For low-cost oil producers like SA, it's a win-win.

Unfortunately, for the rest of us it's a lose-lose, raising a higher price barrier to renewables and conservation. 









 Why the question mark in the headline? As the lead sentence says, "The world's glaciers are disappearing". 




 Sure, but it's all relative. Free healthcare, free university education, more than a month of vacation, $20/hr wages for McDonald's employees, and a government that taxes 44% of GDP are pretty left wing wherever you go. 




 Yes, we are in an interglacial period. No, there is [no danger of plunging into another ice age](https://www.skepticalscience.com/heading-into-new-little-ice-age-intermediate.htm), at least within the next several centuries, so definitely no need to "prevent" that. 




 Except that in economically comparable places where handguns are readily available, homicide rates are generally much higher, and most are committed with firearms.

In the US, for example, [69%](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_7_murder_types_of_weapons_used_percent_distribution_by_region_2013.xls) of murders are by shooting, and 75% of those are with handguns. 














 "Some left-wing parties have also urged the right-wing government to work out a wider mandate for the fund 

Oh, yes, the "right-wing government" of Norway...

That phrase just made my coffee come out my American nose. 




 Thanks for the great answer! 









 Isn't the model predicated on political differences among counties, states and Congressional Districts? So isn't the result really a map of overall political attitudes rather than anything specific to climate alone? It certainly looks that way. 




 "As Bartlett noted, Federal Reserve policy (slashing interest rates) and the stimulus from increased government spending were also important factors."

Three Pinocchios for Mr. Paul. Again. 




 It's being blamed for conditions in the Northeast as well. The polar jet pushed extremely northward off the West Coast then pulls Arctic air southward to the East Coast.  




 Detroit is merely one of [many American cities](https://www.google.com/search?q=american+city+homicide+rates+per+100,000 client=safari rls=en tbm=isch tbo=u source=univ sa=X ei=bAYnVfqOJMvWoASstIHoDg ved=0CEUQsAQ biw=1063 bih=500#imgrc=iHMcC_C_EJh1XM%253A%3B6gsbx7XDPzh6NM%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fd28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net%252Fimages%252Finfografik%252Fnormal%252FChartOfTheDay_1693_Detroit_is_Americas_Most_Dangerous_City_n.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.statista.com%252Fchart%252F1693%252Fdetroit-is-americas-most-dangerous-city%252F%3B960%3B684) more violent than Glasgow. Hell, many American small towns are more violent than Glasgow. 




 Actually, more guns are smuggled from the US to Mexico than the other way round. Most illegal guns in the US were legally purchased at some point, then stolen or resold to felons, etc.. 

In my area, pickup trucks are magnets for window-smashing prowlers who know that pickup drivers are more likely to keep handguns in the vehicle. Those weapons are then easily sold to fences. 














 The House is the article's focus. As a counterpoint, I simply said that it fails to mention the greater bias against city dwellers in the Senate and the Electoral College.  




 "By a straw purchaser, which is in itself illegal. So legally purchased? Technically. Legally obtained? No.

Cite?  




 However, most U.S. shootings do not happen during the commission of crimes, and the guns are most often legally purchased. 









 "If we use all of the fossil fuels in the ground, the planet will warm in a way that is difficult to imagine. Unless the economics of energy markets change, we are poised to use them.

Unless the economics change...

Which is why no market-based approach will work. We are either willing to sacrifice a bit to maintain a habitable, prosperous planet, or we are not.  




 Good points all, except that killing "sprees" are pretty rare in the US. Most US shootings are in the heat of sudden disputes and confrontations, where, as you say, pulling a trigger is simply much easier than raging after someone with a knife, and with far greater certainty that you won't be killed or mangled in the bargain. But the typical death toll is one or two victims per incident. 




 What do you know about water supply challenges in Beijing, where, due to water stress, some are questioning the city's bid to host the Olympics? 




 True, but it's the second map showing opinions by state that's the most disturbing. All those barely populated, fossil-fuel dependent states like Wyoming get the same number of Senators as populous, progressive states like California. The Electoral College gives a similar (but smaller) advantage to empty states in Presidential elections. In short, the US Constitution ensures that each voter from remote coal and oil country gets three votes against every one for a city dweller.  




 That and aging populations. The correlation with leaded gasoline is [striking indeed](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/01/03/how-lead-caused-americas-violent-crime-epidemic/). 




 [The reason](http://www.humanosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GunViolence.png) is no mystery. 




 To be fair, the UK had tight controls and a very low handgun ownership rate before the ban, so the ban didn't change much. 




 The greatest responsibility most of us will ever shoulder.

Of course we know our kids will eventually follow us to the grave, but the possibility that *their* distant progeny will eventually become the much improved beings that *we* would like to be is worth all the trouble, as long as we don't overdo it, don't you think? 














 "it's doubtful that solar and other renewable alternatives can make up for the vast energy contribution of fossil fuels anytime soon. 

[Not so. And why leave out nuclear?](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/report-maps-out-decarbonization-plan-for-u.s-18362)
