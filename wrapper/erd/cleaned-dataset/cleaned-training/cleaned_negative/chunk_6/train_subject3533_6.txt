 I'm crying on the inside :(( 

I've been running 5* No. 9, 5* Yeo, and 4* Alex for everything, should I start focusing on Alex instead or keep trying for Susanoo? 




 I recently started playing Crusader Quest about less than a week ago and I already have a 5* No. 9 and a 4* Alex, I heard about the Alex/Susanoo/No. 9 combo and I'm almost there.... problem is that every time I promote a warrior, I get Joan. Four promotes in and all I've gotten is Joan. I pulled Joan from a Premium too. Do the RNG gods hate me or.... is this some secret bug or something :( or is this really normal?? 




 This is by far my favorite piece written on this flag issue. Thanks for sharing. I can't believe some students are sending death threats to these 6. I feel like every thing is being blown out of proportion. 




 I started playing three days ago and I was able to pull Sneak off that contract and then used the gems and pulled No. 9 :) 




 I read that as India and was thoroughly confused.... 




 They'll get DS once DST is off Early Access, but for previous owners of DS, does that mean we're just paying 5$ for two copies of DST? Did you get a copy of DS to gift or was it just not there?

 How enforced is the VDC Grad parking lot? I live in VDC Grad but can't get a permit/registration since I'm subleasing, so you think I can get by parking at the lot without getting caught or ticketed?
