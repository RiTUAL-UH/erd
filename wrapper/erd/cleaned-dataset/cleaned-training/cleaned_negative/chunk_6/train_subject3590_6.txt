 Here's plain. Add whatever flavoring\nuts you want. http://ozlemsturkishtable.com/2012/06/home-made-turkish-delight-lokum-and-they-go-so-well-with-turkish-coffee/ 




 Two ways I like:

* Cut in half, where the pit was drizzle some nice olive oil and handsomely season with S\P.

* When I have a little more time, I love to caramelize some shallots with cumin, paprika, lime juice. Throw in some almonds at the end. Put it in a bowl, and make some toast in the same pan. Then I take an avocado, mush it up, add salt, pepper, olive oil and a little bit of balsamic or rice-wine vinegar. Spread that on the toast, and add the shallot\almond on top.  




 Inclusion or exclusion: Perhaps a normally loud atmosphere grows suspiciously quiet. Or maybe some element of the atmosphere starts in a rhythmic fashion, like water dripping or a rusty fan.Or maybe it's nature and the animals that inhabit the enviornment start making alarm sounds.  




 Think of not only where you are, but what's beyond the walls of the scene. 

* What time is it? 
* What season?
* Is it tense? 
* for your restaurant is it fancy, is there also a bar? where is the kitchen?
* How does the environment react to what's goin' on?

If it's a tense winter night, chances are there aren't going to be crickets in the background or children going to school for instance.  




 Mysteries is vastly different than Job - I encourage you to see it. It's 50 different playwrights' individual interpretation of a given Bible parable.  














 I still say "Alblum" instead of "Album"

 Hi All!

I'm having a Sambusah party in 2 days (Iranian pastry empanadas). I've made them before but need advice on making A LOT in the most efficient way possible. This is for around 20-30 people so figure I'm making around 100-150 total sambusahs. 

I plan on making my 5 fillings on day #1.

Day 2 will be all about stuffing and folding them. Then baking some and frying some so that they'll be fresh when people start arriving in the evening. I have 2 questions:

* What is the most **efficient way to prep** so that I can do as much ahead of time but keep them fresh. Can I stuff some day-1 and refrigerate, or will they got soggy? Maybe freeze the ones I'm frying?

* **Folding** them can be a time consuming process. Any tips to speed it up?

*  I was also considering other forms some could take, like an **open cup**. Any tips on how to make puff pastry mini cups? Could I make these day 1 and then fill them right before? Should they be refrigerated or room temp? 




 nope... it actually seems like a marketing stunt for ABC to promote it's new show  




 on new years day there's the "polar bear swim" there which is probably pretty fun to check out 




 Yeah they're great! If you like them make sure you check out the [Golden Festival](www.goldenfest.org).  




 Native Brooklynite here. Use [HopStop](http://www.hopstop.com) to figure out trains once you know your destination. 

I would suggest either walking across the Brooklyn bridge to DUMBO or you could take the F to York or the A\C to High St. Walk around [Dumbo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUMBO) and then go up the hill (or squibb bridge) to [Brooklyn Heights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights) to see some really nice tree lined brownstoney streets and the [Promenade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights_Promenade). 

Some alternatives: Walk the length of **5th Ave in Park Slope.** You could either take any train to Barclay's Center or 2/3 to Bergen.  Cool things to check out there:

* [BierKraft](http://www.bierkraft.com/)

* [Skyice](http://www.yelp.com/biz/skyice-sweet-and-savory-brooklyn) good Thai food that's a bit better than standard fare. Casual. Really interesting icecream flavors

* [Gorilla Coffee](http://gorillacoffee.com/) Strong Stuff!

* [Barbs](http://www.barbesbrooklyn.com) Amazing music every night of the year. 

* etc...  

Or take the B\Q all the way out to **Brighton Beach.** Get lunch at [Cafe Kashkar](http://kashkarcafe.com/) or one of the [Russian places](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Brighton+Beach+Russian+Restaurants find_loc=Brooklyn%2C+NY)  and then walk down the boardwalk to Coney Island which is erie but kinda cool in the winter. Good if you're adventurous and like Russian stuff. 

Don't goto Williamsburg. It's just an extension of Manhattan and full of people trying too hard to act like what they think of as "real New Yorkers"    




 I spent some time this summer interpreting from my non-native second language (Turkish) into English for some friends I was traveling with. When I was in the thick of it, doing it daily, I started dreaming in both simultaneously. It was as if I was interpreting the dialog in my dreams as it occurred.  




 Yeah you're right. I had the impression that she wanted to explore authentic East New York to see "what the city is really about..." 




 * **The Staten Island Ferry** You don't need tickets, don't worry about it. 

* **Ground Zero** No idea, but I'm sure you can just show up. 

* **City pass....** I'm a native New Yorker and never heard of this. The MET is free and you can give them whatever you want at entry so a "discount" seems silly.  

* **Subway** Get a weekly pass. That makes sense since you'll be jetting around all week. Every station has a machine where you can get one. 

* **Tickets** Goto TKTS. Like u/SilverMarch said the one in Downtown Brooklyn is the easiest. From there you can easily walk and see the Brooklyn Heights promenade\DUMBO\Brooklyn Bridge


* **Central Park** Like anywhere in New York, **the best thing you can do is just walk around, get lost and find your own little surprises**. The horses are pricy but easy to find. 

* **Bus Tour** No clue. Be a real New Yorker and walk! 

* **The Projects** Don't be an idiot.  




 Folks have already suggested Kalustiyans and Sahadi's as I was. I'd also add Patel Brothers in Jackson Heights to the list for anything indian. Go there to be inspired: there will be plenty of stuff you don't even recognize.  




 Also check the places across the street from Sahadi's or Damascus next door for middle eastern goods.  




 It is become even less sparsely populated to due to migration after the late 80's onwards. People in the East came to the Istanbul \ the cities seeking work and refuge from armed conflict between the state and the PKK.  




 Seems like the most popular was answer was "I don't think anything about it!"
