 there's also L. Fletcher Prouty's very convincing discussion of how Atsugi airbase in Japan was for the cream of the crop--it was Top Secret--located underground. The men who were stationed there worked on the CIA's U2 flights...

There were also 2 RIFLES found at the TSBD: a German Mauser and the Italian Carcano...You can watch Walter Cronkite informing the public about the Mauser--and see BOTH of the rifles in "Evidence of Revision"

EDIT: if you haven't seen it yet--you should watch "Everything Is A Rich Man's Trick" on youtube (it has a couple of curveballs, but, overall is a must-see) 




 John Brennan being the SPOOKIEST...former Deputy Director under George Tenet...cheerleader of the torture program...then went on to be head of a private corporation which helped add 1,000,000 people to the no-fly list...the corporation was also tied directly to the Obama/McCain/Clinton passport scandal during the presidential election.

I didn't know Carter had written an op-ed calling for a strike on North Korea--that's friggin' scary.  Any strike by anyone would lead to millions of deaths...it's absolutely insane to think this would be good for anyone on earth.

 NEW Name: "60 Minutes of Pentagon Propaganda"  




 I would definitely say a mixture of all 3. we know the police unions lobby for laws to be written in certain ways...we know cops plant evidence and lie in reports...and we know the worst of them become outright criminals...

the cops will not testify or arrest other cops--and whatever drums up business and puts cash in the city/county/state coffers is a.o.k.

the CIA/DoD is on a much larger level--you basically have tens of thousands of the brightest minds in the Pentagon-CIA and think tanks with humongous sums of money to spend to drum up more villains and more war.  the dangerous part is that these people all have a similar world view (they are in the military or have been vetted and then hired only if they are acceptable). 









 US officials were WRONG about Iraq how many times???

Why the fuck is anyone still believing these WARMONGERS??? 




 nbc, abc, cnn, cbs, nyt, fox--it's all just fucking propaganda.

 I highly doubt it--but the postman delivering mail in a gyrocopter to the capitol lawn certainly caught everyone with their pants down around their ankles again...I wonder how much the mailman spent on the contraption and how fast he was going...I guess he flew it into DC from Pennsylvania.

 that was a curveball that bent my mind a bit at first, too...but when you have a CIA guy stating on camera they did do body switches--it adds a little traction...The documentary's final breakdown of the JFK assassination is pretty out-of-the-box as well...

After going to WAR in Afghanistan and Iraq--why couldn't President Bush testify under oath and in public before the 9/11 Commission? 

Even more outrageous is the [5 minute press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) he held afterwards in which there weren't even 6 questions asked. Bush had made 9/11 the cornerstone of our entire foreign and domestic policy--yet he can't spend even 60 minutes answering questions about 9/11 before the public?

watch the 5 minute press conference (link above) for yourself--look at his body language and listen to his answers...important to note that Bushie-boy can't say he testified before the panel--because he wasn't even placed under oath.

 Something has to be FORCED to happen--it's obvious the media are lackeys and all arms of the USG are impotent. 




 This is almost as funny as when the US sued Iraq for $1 TRILLION--claiming Iraq was responsible for 9/11.

Can't imagine the BILL Iraq and Afghanistan and Yemen and Pakistan and Syria will be sending to the USA for KILLING PEOPLE in their countries. If one missionary is worth that much--how much does 3 million Iraqis add up to???  how much does destroying a country add up to?  how much does creating millions of refugees add up to?

 




 I wish our police would attack Pentagon/VA/Banker corruption with the same veracity as they do untaxed cigarettes...all they care about is War and Profit.

 I'm with you...imagine if we had high-speed rails and had swiched over to green energy 30 years ago...If MLK were alive today he would be pretty disappointed I think...one of his last speeches "Beyond Vietnam" was about spending on social welfare and stopping the enormous military violence and expenditures. 




 I think the u.s. is currently still building a new airstrip in Okinawa.

 They are getting ready for U.S. base closures--while the military is OPENING new bases in Japan, Philippines...and who knows where else. I think they did close a couple in Germany I think.

 (I'm copy/pasting the entire Wash Times article because their website is a pain in the ass--but the article is definitely worth a read)

The Washington Times - Saturday, March 22, 2008

The State Department investigation of improper computer access to passport records of three presidential candidates is focusing on one remaining employee  a contract worker with a company headed by an adviser to the presidential campaign of Sen. Barack Obama

The probe by States inspector general will include polygraph tests for supervisors in the passport section to find out whether the three contract employees who accessed the records had a political motive or were part of a political operation to obtain personal data on Mr. Obama, Sen. John McCain or Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Two of the three contract employees had been fired before The Washington Times first reported Thursday on security breaches involving Mr. Obamas passport records. The furor expanded yesterday to incidents involving the passport records of Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton.

**The third employee, who has not been fired, worked for The Analysis Corporation (TAC), which is headed by John O. Brennan**, a former CIA agent who is an adviser to Mr. Obamas presidential campaign on intelligence and foreign policy.

The TAC employee is the only individual to have accessed both Mr. Obamas and Mr. McCains passport information without proper authorization, a State Department spokesman said. That employee, who was not named, triggered an electronic alarm system, officials familiar with the probe said.

The accessed records have the data provided in passport applications and used by the department to issue or renew travel documents.

State Department officials said Thursday and yesterday that the intrusions appeared to be the result of imprudent curiosity on the part of contract employees who were hired last summer to help process passport applications.

In Portland, Ore., Mr. Obama said the series of attempts to tap into peoples personal records were a problem not just for me but for how our government functions.

I expect a full and thorough investigation. It should be done in conjunction with those congressional committees that have oversight so its not simply an internal matter, Mr. Obama told reporters.

Mr. McCain, who is traveling in France, called for an apology and a full investigation of the breach. The United States of America values everyones privacy and corrective action should be taken, he said.

Mrs. Clinton had not publicly commented by yesterday evening.

Mr. McCormack said the investigation also will determine whether the records of other high-profile political candidates were accessed improperly and whether there are systemic problems.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice promised that the department will carry out a full investigation and expressed anger about the breaches, as well as the failure to notify senior officials.

It should have been known to senior management. It was not, to my knowledge. And we also want to take every step that we can to make sure that this kind of thing doesnt happen again, she said, adding apologies to all three candidates, starting with Mr. Obama.

I was sorry and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed if I learned that somebody had looked into my passport file, Miss Rice said of her telephone apology yesterday to the Illinois senator. She also called Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain.

**Officials do not know whether information was improperly copied, altered or removed from the database during the intrusions**.

We are looking at [whether] there is anything more to why these people did this other than inappropriate curiosity, said Patrick F. Kennedy, undersecretary of state for management, who is in charge of the passport offices.

State Department officials met for about 90 minutes with the Senate staffs of each candidate, along with the staff of Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., Delaware Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has jurisdiction over the Foreign Service.

Rep. Henry A. Waxman, California Democrat, sent a letter to Miss Rice demanding to know the names of the contract employees.

Besides the TAC employee, the State Department said the other two employees worked for Stanley Inc., a 3,500-person technology firm based in Arlington that this week won a $570 million contract to continue providing passport services to the State Department, work the company has done since 1992.

**TAC, a McLean-based information firm that has helped the State Department automate the Terrorist Watchlist over the last several years**, issued a statement last night that it had been notified earlier in the day that one of its contractors had acted improperly. The firm said it had honored a State Department request not to fire its consultant to help the investigation.

**This individuals actions were taken without the knowledge or direction of anyone at TAC and are wholly inconsistent with our professional and ethical standards**, the company wrote.

Calls to the Obama campaign about Mr. Brennan were not returned.

Mr. McCormack said yesterday there was a fourth person who breached the passport records, although he described it as a case of inadvertance. He said a passport office trainee last year was learning how to work with passport electronic records and searched for Mrs. Clintons file as a test, but was immediately admonished, and it didnt happen again.

Working-level supervisors confronted the three employees after a computer alarm system was triggered by the effort to access Mr. Obamas records.

What didnt happen is that that information didnt rise up to senior management levels, so that we could be made aware of it. That should have happened, Mr. McCormack said.

If senior officials were alerted to the intrusions, additional safeguards would have been used to protect the data, Mr. McCormack said.

Officials said the computer alarm that was set off includes a notification mechanism that should have alerted States inspector general. However, it is not clear whether the IG reviewed the improper computer activities, the officials said.

Acting Inspector General William E. Todd and the chief IG branch investigator, James B. Burch, a former U.S. Secret Service agent, are leading the passport probe, which began Thursday. **Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey** said his department was no reason yet to investigate.

Miss Rice and Mr. Kennedy did not learn of the breaches of Mr. Obamas personal data until The Times e-mailed questions about the security breaches on Thursday.

As soon as we realized that there were these unauthorized accesses for Senator Obamas passport files, we collected the information, we briefed the secretary, we briefed Senator Obamas staff, all before we ever replied to the reporter, Mr. McCormack said.

Then we replied to the reporter, and then we all talked to the rest of you as the questions came in, he said.

 NICE, thanks for posting...

Fetzer seems to go too far quite often--but this slideshow seems spot-on in many areas...Fetzer points out the vans were erased from the background in the Zapruder film.

Once you add in the fact that Col.

 The U.S. will become involved in another war (or two or three)...at some point oil fields in Saudi Arabia (or Iraq) will be set ablaze--then the prices will skyrocket as the u.s. moves in to control the situation...

will the world be split into a US-UK vs Russia-China Battle Royale???

If this happens I hope we can actually produce some computers/phones here in the US...with California under a drought--we are also importing a huge amount of our agricultural products, too...South America (where much of our food comes from) seems to be tiring of being on the butt end of the our bankers economic warfare and CIA overthrows...

it is so fuct what our government has done since the end of WWII--the whole world would have been happy to have our help--but we took advantage of them...instead of letting democracy sell itself we allowed the corporations to rule and we have become tyrants who sell democracy by bombing countries around the globe.

 It would be interesting to compare 2012 to 2014...maybe using one random sample from each week to see if there is a difference in the variety of sources being linked--and seeing if there is a difference.

 I remember after the changes took place--I pointed out that the bbc/guardian literally made up more than half of the r/worldnews Front Page

http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2arx5o/congratulations_rworldnewsyou_are_becoming/ 




 I think there was also a spycase in the 50's or 60's involving an NSA officer named Snowden (I forget the first name).  He got busted selling secrets to the Soviets and enjoyed buying a Cadillac and a boat with the money.... 




 I agree--I think the electric outage at the White House was a complete false flag designed to SPOOK. Think about the complete rehab the White House got after 9/11--you'd have to be an idiot to think they wouldn't upgrade the electric as they were fortifying it during the construction.

I remember seeing a photo of the WH with the front completely covered with a tarp. I think I remember something about the WH receiving the same type of material which the Pentagon had added (which was hit by a plane or missile on 9/11). I would assume some additional offensive weapon capability was added to the roof of the WH.  In any case, I just can't believe the WH would be connected to the same grid as the general public after 9/11 (obviously commercial and residential buildings are far removed from the WH at this point). 




 I think AJ is a provocateur--in it for the $$$$$$$$$$$.

I think AJ is right about a lot of issues--and is harassed by the gov't on a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis.

I think AJ has seen the writing on the wall--and has made changes in the way infowars covers issues. For example, infowars did not post any articles questioning the Tsarnaev conviction during the trial--because he knows the gov't will come down on his ass even harder.  It also seems like Infowars has also added more mainstream links to their mix over the last year (ex: cbs "news"). AJ also knows that google is fucking everyone and making independent articles vanish when people search for "9/11 WTC 7".

I don't think AJ is "controlled opposition" but I do think he is willingly changing the way infowars operates because he sees what the gov't and google are doing. In the end--it's not much of a difference (effectively the gov't has muted infowars).

I would also note that AJ was most likely harassed "Extra Special" on his trip to NYC (which is when he did the Piers Morgan segment I think).  The authorities KNOW they can fuck with him--and it will affect his performance.  It does not excuse AJ making an ass of himself--but it does show a Reason as to Why he may have been wound extra tight the day he went bonkers on cnn. I think AJ even posted a video of him being bullied by NYPD on his way back to his room...

**THREAT INFLATION**

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

 QUIT watching/reading CNN--you may as well just put your nose up Ashton Carter's anus. 




 The CIA has been out of fucking control since day 1.

In 1947, these fuckers were [operating on U.S. soil to recruit members of the National Student Association](http://www.c-span.org/video/?324828-1/book-discussion-patriotic-betrayal)--a group funded by the CIA. Must have been hard duping 20 year-olds into signing secrecy agreements (before they knew who they were working for)!!!

When the CIA was created by a handful of [OSS-Wall Streeters and Pentagon Mafia](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article30605.htm), the only other people who knew the CIA existed were a few sycophantic senators and President Truman.  It would be 50 years before Americans would find out the CIA received much of their early funding through a secret codicil in the Marshall Plan. That's right: while everyone thought the Marshall Plan funds were going to rebuild cities in Europe/Asia after WWII--the CIA was secretly skimming 5% to buy mansions and fund political parties in Italy, France, Japan (etc). 

FACT IS:  We only know a small percentage of what the CIA did 50 years ago...and we don't have a fucking clue what these fuckers are doing today. 

[WTFU america](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM). Even President Truman thought the CIA was out of control--he wrote an [editorial in the *Washington Post*](http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman's%20CIA%20article.html) exactly one month after JFK was whacked: 

+ For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas.
     




 the fucking criminals at the Pentagon and the CIA don't necessarily have to go to war to profit--all they need to do is scare the fuck out of stupid Americans--strike fear into them so they can spend whatever amount of money they want on their bullshit programs--

FYI: the U.S. had about 300 nuclear weapons in 1950...by 1960 the U.S. had 18,000 nuclear weapons. (Eisenhower sure did a great job controlling the MIC)

 Fucking "Horseface John"...at this point one has to wonder if he was CIA controlled opposition from the start. 




 kc would be a cool spot...tons of talent came outta there...robert altman did a ONE star movie called "Kansas City" with a FOUR star soundtrack...be easier to recreate than most urban centers--and there are plenty, plenty of storylines which naturally occur there ...of course KC's biggest star recorded IN CHICAGO, though.

The Westadt book looks like it hit the nail on the head--hadn't heard of it... 




 It is definitely a positive sign that there are now so many different professions which have scientific questions--the architects   engineers being the most prominent. Adding pilots' research adds another layer to the cake.

But it does seem that there are some fields which have most likely been silenced by confidentiality agreements: politicians, first responders, military...I would bet the victims' families are silenced as well (once they have signed Feinberg's compensation fund). 




 Cheers to Mr. Blum.

As the U.S. dollar is being eclipsed by the Chinese yuan--it might be a good idea for the U.S. to quit dictating to the entire planet. 

Someday the U.S. might actually need some goddamn friends and just about every other nation on earth has plenty of reasons to turn their back on us due to the underhanded actions of the CIA and the lies the State Department cranks out on a daily basis. 

The U.S. has attempted overthrow after overthrow after overthrow--sad that so many Americans don't realize what the CIA has done in our name.  At least in Russia most of the readers know they are being lied to--in the U.S.A. the readers mostly still believe the crap fox-cbs-abc-nbc-nyt is feeding us from the bowels of the CIA-Pentagon-State Dept Propaganda Machine.

How fucked up is it that I get more truth from RT news than I do from these corporate news sychophants??? 




 As it's late nite on a Saturday--I was pretty much joking...

I have watched the Pilots for Truth video and definitely think You Are Right--this is another Big Gigantic piece of information which should be brought up more often. 




 The Hey Day of Jazz was in the 20's and 30's...WWII broke up many of the bands and helped kill Jazz...BeBop emerged on the backend. Early R   B started in the late 40's and Rock n' Roll came about in the mid 50's...the [Chitlin' Circuit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Chitlin-Circuit-Road-Rock/dp/0393342948) does a great job of describing what life was like for the African-American musicians. The shows traveled around the country--often a wide variety of acts were included. There were no huge modern amps back then, so the shows were quite a bit different. But imagine seeing Ruth Brown with Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis (plus many others)--all on the same bill. 

Chicago RULED in the 20's--Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton were there at the height of Jazz in 1926.  The "Chicago School" of jazz musicians would head to the South Side to catch Armstrong--among them were: Benny Goodman, Bix Biederbecke, Artie Shaw and Gene Krupa. The white musicians morphed Jazz into Swing in the 30's--everything popped one night in LA during a Benny Goodman show and the Swing craze started. 

You should be able to find Ken Burns' *JAZZ* documentary on youtube--the first 3 or 4 episodes do a great job of describing the history of Jazz into Swing into Be Bop...one of the biggest surprises you will find is the racism which was so prevalent...even in the 50's and 60's some of the New Orleans musicians remember playing a gig where they would put a curtain in front of the band *while they were playing*.  




 OUCH--my brain hurts...it has to do with UA175 flying faster into the WTC than is physically possible, right? 




 I certainly wouldn't say that...I would say many of them should be prosecuted--but that will never happen. 




 I would disagree--at this point anyone who can read KNOWS the CIA and the NSA are involved in many acts which are morally despicable and constitutionally illegal. Some of these NSA-CIA actions are directed towards Americans on U.S. soil. 

The most recent example being the CIA's creation and funding of the National Student Association--created in 1947 (cough, cough) to act as a honeypot which duped U.S. college students into informing on international students.  




 The ground the Pentagon stands on was also referred to as "Hell's Bottom."

When Roosevelt saw the plans he told them to cut the size in half--they didn't listen.  




 FYI: the is NO relationship between We the People and the CIA.  The CIA was created behind closed doors with no open discussion--a handful of OSS-Wall Streeters and Pentagon Mafia secretly had the Agency created and funded.  

We the People have no fucking goddamn idea what they have done--or what they are doing at this moment. We do know they have LIED and LIED and LIED to us...maybe that's why they won't let We the People see any files--any further exposure would only reveal more LIES.

 




 Thanks...I wrote/posted it last week--it got a few upvotes and drifted into oblivion...

Take it and run with it if you like--be interesting to see what you come up with!!! 




 Yup--I noticed that...possibly "Mohammed Atta" is a popular name (as in there are many people named Mohammed Atta)?

 




 (Partial?) Answer:  [The CIA Is Wall Street, and Drug Money Is King](http://www.american-buddha.com/911.ciawallstreetruppert.htm) 




 The US Government is more interested in WAR than in creating PEACE. The USG hides our own history from We the People. The USG allows War Crimes by our own leaders to go unpunished.

-----------------

The USG allows the bankers to walk away from prosecution. If a citizen transfers money illegally or commits mortgage fraud--we'd be locked up, but the banks are allowed to make out of court settlements with no prosecution on the record. But We the People must follow the ever-increasing library of laws and regulations now imposed on us.

The USG allows the DoD to write their own checks with no audit necessary--while the citizens and small businesses of the country follow the law and submit their taxes or face serious penalties.

The USG allows the intelligence agencies to trample our rights and the U.S. Constitution--no serious investigation of the NSA has taken place. We do not know the true actions of the CIA-FBI-DoD because of the extreme secrecy. How can we possibly know if the agencies are acting in our interest--and within the law--if we do not even know what they have done?  

The USG allows our law enforcement to jail millions. They would rather pay for our citizens to be jailed than pay for our children to receive the best education or provide training for those who need it. 

The USG attacks other countries around the globe--JSOC has boots on the ground in about 100 countries right now. Will we end up in another "war"? Will it be in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? Iran? Korea? China? Russia? Will it be because they attacked our soil or because we are protecting the business interests of the .01%?

The USG also wages economic warfare against other countries which leads to instability and is not a peaceful long-term solution. We do not need to overthrow other governments--they have a right to be their own sovereign nation and to live peacefully. Other nations have a right to make their own laws and choose their own leaders.

The USG would rather invade other countries and build military bases and infrastructure over there than upgrade our own infrastructure. Most of our soldiers should be employed building roads, high-speed rail lines, and green energy infrastructure--but instead they are sent to fight for oil and the PetroDollar. 

The USG allows corporations to write our laws: agriculture, banks, energy, healthcare, media/cable conglomerates, transportation, tax laws...

FINALLY: The USG allowed our country to be attacked on 9/11 with no open investigation. In fact, our leaders openly resisted the investigations of both the Joint Intelligence Committee and the 9/11 Commission. Evidence was destroyed, the investigations were obstructed and the evidence hidden from We the People (and the world).

I do love the people here--but the USG is FAILING. Our leaders should be concentrating on helping us--the tax payers--instead of bombing other countries around the globe and leading us into another War. Who is running things--the Pentagon? the CIA? the defense companies? the bankers?

 Det. Asshole Cherry most likely has done this many other times--this is just the first time it was caught on camera.

Who knows what Det. Asshole Cherry would have done if there weren't 2 witnesses in the back of the car.

 ...and our current president quoted MLK on his way to getting elected, dedicated a statue to MLK once he was elected and, most recently, made a trip to Selma (in part) to celebrate the life of MLK--but forgets to call for the release of the FBI records.

Hollow, disingenuous words followed by disingenuous actions...

NEVER FORGET:  MLK would be abhorred by the 1,000+ drone strikes Obama has allowed and the continuation of the excessive military spending the U.S.A. is pumping into WAR, INC.

NEVER FORGET:  the speech that got MLK killed was his ["Beyond Vietnam"](http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_beyond_vietnam/) speech which he made exactly one year before he was assassinated by elements of our own government.

NEVER FORGET: that the reason we do NOT have a full video of MLK's speech is because the media left after they got some news footage and STOPPED recording--they LEFT the event in the middle of the speech.  Luckily, we do have the audio recording and MLK's full, written speech.
 














 The author does a great job in the book of describing the fanatical taste federal authorities had for prosecuting Al Capone. Eig, thru a stroke of luck, actually got the government to release an unreleased FBI file which showed that Capone was not responsible for the St. Valentine's Day Massacre--it was actually crooked Chicago cops who were killing mobsters to pay them back for a robbery which had taken place a week prior (a cop had been killed in the robbery). Of course, FBI Director/Blackmailer J. Edgar Hoover never saw cops killing gangsters on St. Valentine's Day as a crime.

But, Prohibition had directly led to an upsurge in violent crime among the gangsters protecting their booze and territories. President Hoover appointed a special prosecutor to take Capone down. The prosecutor eventually found evidence from a previous bust of a gin joint--it was an accounting ledger which the government used in their tax evasion case to estimate what Capone's income was. But the accounting ledger also showed the money the cops were being paid off as well. Obviously, the cops were never prosecuted. Same accounting ledger--but all the crooked cops walked as they watched Capone go down. 

Interesting that Eig notes how the prison doctors used "experimental" drugs on Capone while he was being treated in prison for syphilis. Who knows--Capone may not even have had syphilis--they may have just fucked him up while they were using him as a guinea pig.  




 very well written article with some great quotes by former LEOs.

i see the cops literally preying upon the African-American population everyday where I live...they literally drive down a main street from a white part of town, pull into the walmart--so they can check all the license plates...then they wait for them to drive out, pull them over and, cha-ching--more money for the corporate prison complex. 

some municipalities actually have parking enforcement drive around and ticket out of state vehicles once they are parked in an area over 30 days for not transferring plates (it might even be shorter than 30 days).

for those who haven't heard: the License Plate Readers the cops use while they are cruising mall parking lots (or pulling you over) will automatically pull up the registered river's info and make different audio sounds for offenses (a cash register opening for a late ticket payment, etc)....dana priest (Wash Post) reported on this in her 2006 book *Top Secret America* (which was mostly focused on the growth of the government/corporate intelligence agencies post 9/11).

 Fully agree the "free beacon" is either a group of CIA sycophants or a CIA funded operation...

I just wonder if there even was a suicide--possibly the CIA made this up to slow down the release of the report...

...or, more likely, there really was a suicide, in which case there should have been some release of info after the family was notified. The media certainly wasn't interested--that's for sure.

CIA Official Dies in Apparent Suicide

Death did not take place at CIA headquarters

BY: [Bill Gertz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gertz)	  

April 4, 2014 11:46 pm

A senior CIA official has died in an apparent suicide this week from injuries sustained after jumping off a building in northern Virginia, according to sources close to the CIA.

CIA spokesman Christopher White confirmed the death and said the incident did not take place at CIA headquarters in McLean, Va.

We can confirm that there was an individual fatally injured at a facility where agency work is done, White told the Washington Free Beacon. He was rushed to a local area hospital where he subsequently died. Due to privacy reasons and out of respect for the family, we are not releasing additional information at this time.

A source close to the agency said the man who died was a middle manager and the incident occurred after the man jumped from the fifth floor of a building in Fairfax County.

Many agency employees are known to work under stressful conditions and high stress is considered a part of the profession, for the three general types of employees: Intelligence analysts and support personnel, technical services operators, and members of the clandestine services, the agencys elite spying branch.

The CIA is known to operate or rent space in a number of semi-secret locations in the country, including at least one high-rise building in Tysons Corner.

The agency also operates a number of top-secret facilities used by its clandestine service officers, including agency safe houses.

No other details of the death could be learned.

The agency is currently engaged in a high profile dispute with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Sen. Diane Feinstein (D., Calif.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said the CIA has blocked efforts by the committee to investigate harsh interrogation of terrorists.

Committee staff members working at a CIA facility in Northern Virginia to investigate agency interrogation practices also have charged that the CIA covertly searched the agencys computers that were being used in the investigation.

The agency subsequently reported that several Senate staff members had improperly and possibly illegally removed classified material from the CIA. The FBI was asked to investigate the mishandling of classified information in the case.

The agency is under pressure from Congress to declassify a 6,000-page report on agency interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, used to glean information from al Qaeda terrorists captured after the 2001 attacks on Washington and New York.

The agency also this week came under scrutiny from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence over the agencys role in obscuring the facts surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell told the committee that agency analysts concluded that a protest took place in advance of the attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.

Morrell testified that subsequent information revealed this judgment to be incorrect.

The CIA was operating a facility in Benghazi with a large number of agency personnel whose activities had not been made public.

Speculation about the CIA annex in Benghazi has focused on the agencys role in supplying weapons to Libyan militias that in turn were shipping the arms to Islamist rebels in Syria.

------------------ 




 The article in the *Washington Free Beacon* was the only source of info (all other articles merely repeated the vague details from the Free Beacon).

Even stranger still was the TIMING of the release of the freebeacon.com article: **11:46 PM on a Friday night**. It was just ONE DAY AFTER the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) had voted to release the $40 million Torture Report Edit which looked into CIA actions in the post-9/11 era. There had been hearings on Benghazi that week as well...Seymour Hersh had released his article The Red Line and the Rat Line in the London Review of Books (which has been thoroughly whitewashed in the complicit U.S. media)...

In 2011 Barack Obama led an allied military intervention in Libya without consulting the US Congress. Last August, after the sarin attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, he was ready to launch an allied air strike, this time to punish the Syrian government for allegedly crossing the **red line** he had set in 2012 on the use of chemical weapons.

... The **rat line**, authorised in early 2012, was used to funnel weapons and ammunition from Libya via southern Turkey and across the Syrian border to the opposition. Many of those in Syria who ultimately received the weapons were jihadists, some of them affiliated with al-Qaida.

So NO ONE at any news organization has been able to follow-up on this in the past YEAR???

 ---------------

Frustrating listening to this interview--wish Jon Gold had scored a few more points early on--especially with the reasoning behind Iraq. The Iraq War wasn't just about oil--what a lot of people miss is that it was about the PetroDollar. In fall 2000, [Saddam had switched from the PetroDollar to the Euro](http://ftmdaily.com/preparing-for-the-collapse-of-the-petrodollar-system-part-3/) in Iraq's oil-for-food program. The expansion of the Military Industrial Complex greatly enriched thousands of private defense/intelligence corporations. Glad that Jon Gold did mention Dick Cheney and Halliburton and was able to remain quite calm. It's very well documented that the neocons were frothing at the mouth for [regime change in Iraq throughout the 90's](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003). 

I also wish Jon Gold had pointed out how the 9/11 Commission seemed to be set up to fail. Financially, the commission was initially set up with $3 million--which may sound like a lot, but the largest investigation of the largest crime on American mainland soil had to pay 84 people (a large percentage of attorneys). In contrast, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence funded the EDIT the CIA Torture Report with $40 million (right off the bat in 2008). I found Shenon's *The Commission* did a pretty good job of revealing how aspects of the commission were controlled--mostly by Zelikow, but the commission offices were actually in a CIA managed building (and in the wake of what we know of the [CIA spying recently on the SSCI](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/12/calls-brennans-ouster-emerge-along-details-cia-search-senate-computers/)...). It is useful to study the Pattern these commissions/investigations take--reading Gaeton Fonzi's *The Last Investigation* is helpful in this regard (even though it is about the House Sub-Committee on Assassinations).  

Overall, I'm glad I listened and definitely have a lot of respect for Jon Gold who did a great job of separating the 9/11 provocateurs (Alex Jones, Webster Tarpley) from those who are seeking Justice and Accountability. 

I think Jonathon Kay is a sycophant--especially since Jon Gold pointed out that Kay has some slight connection to James Woolsey (a former CIA director). The entire main stream media is corrupted filth--I expect no actual truth from them. They will [LIE us into another useless war soon enough](https://vimeo.com/33033186). Fox, cbs, nbc, abc the nyt--they are all CIA-Pentagon Sycophants (bootlickers, ass-kissers, fawning parasites) who are happy to head home to their McMansions which are paid for In Full with the blood of at least 1.5 million people from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan...and a few thousand dead U.S. soldiers, too. 

----------------- 




 Haven't heard of this before...I would think you should change your password for reddit immediately and contact the mods/sys administrators so they can look into it further. 




 Actually...after WWII, the Marshall Plan was hijacked by the CIA--there was a secret codicil which sent at least 5% of the roughly $15 Billion (about $700 million) to the CIA...these funds were used by the agency to fund political parties in Europe and Japan (as well as to buy large houses for the station chiefs)...the agency also began funding the National Student Association in 1947 (which held conferences around the globe to spy/recruit/tattle on the international students)...

The CIA's take wasn't revealed until about 50 years later (it's always  a great way to control history if you can keep the truth from coming out for at least 50 to 100 years).

CBS, of course, has many CIA ties and would certainly be more than willing to pump out some propaganda. (see Carl Bernstein's "CIA and the Media" article) 




 I just can't believe how often I see VOA (Voice of America) linked to. 




 [*Murrow: His Life and Times*](http://www.amazon.com/Murrow-Times-Communications-Media-Studies/dp/0823218821/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1427847913 sr=1-2-fkmr0 keywords=sperber+edward+r+mussow) by A.M. Sperber...

It was certainly foreboding the way he left CBS, then he took a position for Voice of America and babbled U.S. propaganda in Vietnam. The most trustworthy voice in journalism driven from broadcast tv because he had a dedication to the truth. 

Up until the last few years, I had a deep respect for cbs news and Walter Cronkite--but after researching 20th century u.s. history (especially the JFK assassination, the CIA and 9/11) my respect is shattered. i studied journalism in college--which is what sparked my interest in the Murrow bio. 




 I just wonder: does the head of NSA have an NSA-proof phone, too??? 









 (not trying to break rules...nextgov.com used ALL CAPS in the headline) 




 DoD vs. NSA vs. CIA vs. DIA vs. FBI vs. POTUS vs. SS vs. DHS vs. DEA vs. Congress vs. We the People 




 the article says they sell these phones to private companies and privacy-minded citizens as well... 














 DoD vs. NSA vs. CIA vs. DIA vs. FBI vs. POTUS vs. DHS vs. DEA vs. Congress vs. We the Serfs 














 I read in a Murrow bio that in the middle of WWII Winston Churchill offered Murrow the #1 position at the bbc...he obviously turned it down. After the disgraceful treatment he received from cbs "news" in the 50's I bet he regretted it. 




 would they volunteer if they weren't PAID???

 r/news should be renamed r/NaziNews 




 my point is that I constantly hear people brag about how we have a "voluntary military"...but that seems to obfuscate the fact that they are all paid with substantial benefits (health, education, special financing for mortgages)...obviously, i'm not saying they shouldn't be paid...but there is a substantial portion of troops who are there so they can get money for college and even a small portion who are enlisted so they can receive u.s. citizenship.

the Pentagon employs 3.2 million (some of these are civilians)...i would bet that even the lowest pay grade is somewhere around $30,000 per year...i'm sure there's a significant number who make six figures... 
























 i've never come across the site before--which doesn't mean anything--but many of us "conspiracists" think the government puts out disinfo to make the truthers look wacky. 

i didn't have time to watch the whole interview--that's just my gut reaction. did the architect provide any documents or a photo of him with one of the bin Ladens? the bin Ladens are a huge family and do have a construction company in Saudi Arabia--so there is a chance they may have crossed paths. 

i would also hope the architect would have contacted the authorities at the time if this had actually happened...

glad you like some of my posts--i definitely try to bring some interesting points up... 




 disinfo. 




 very insightful--thanks for posting...i have felt the USG seems hell-bent on war for quite some time because the u.s. seems to be swinging wildly around the globe...i just posted a short essay which expresses my concern for the direction we are on...

i hope we're WRONG!!!

can't believe this didn't even make the front page. 




 The USG allows the bankers to walk away from prosecution. If a citizen transfers money illegally or commits mortgage fraud--we'd be locked up, but the banks are allowed to make out of court settlements with no prosecution on the record. But We the People must follow the ever-increasing library of laws and regulations now imposed on us.

The USG allows the DoD to write their own checks with no audit necessary--while the citizens and small businesses of the country follow the law and submit their taxes or face serious penalties.

The USG allows the intelligence agencies to trample our rights and the U.S. Constitution--no serious investigation of the NSA has taken place. We do not know the true actions of the CIA-FBI-DoD because of the extreme secrecy. How can we possibly know if the agencies are acting in our interest--and within the law--if we do not even know what they have done?  

The USG allows our law enforcement to jail millions. They would rather pay for our citizens to be jailed than pay for our children to receive the best education or provide training for those who need it. 

The USG attacks other countries around the globe--JSOC has boots on the ground in about 100 countries right now. Will we end up in another "war"? Will it be in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? Iran? Korea? China? Russia? Will it be because they attacked our soil or because we are protecting the business interests of the .01%?

The USG also wages economic warfare against other countries which leads to instability and is not a peaceful long-term solution. We do not need to overthrow other governments--they have a right to be their own sovereign nation and to live peacefully. Other nations have a right to make their own laws and choose their own leaders.

The USG would rather invade other countries and build military bases and infrastructure over there than upgrade our own infrastructure. Most of our soldiers should be employed building roads, high-speed rail lines, and green energy infrastructure--but instead they are sent to fight for oil and the PetroDollar. 

The USG allows corporations to write our laws: agriculture, banks, energy, healthcare, media/cable conglomerates, transportation, tax laws...

FINALLY: The USG allowed our country to be attacked on 9/11 with no open investigation. In fact, our leaders openly resisted the investigations of both the Joint Intelligence Committee and the 9/11 Commission. Evidence was destroyed, the investigations were obstructed and the evidence hidden from We the People (and the world).

I do love the people here--but the USG is FAILING. Our leaders should be concentrating on helping us--the tax payers--instead of bombing other countries around the globe and leading us into another War. Who is running things--the Pentagon? the CIA? the defense companies? the bankers?

 In terms of money, I find it even more revealing that the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with just $3 million--while the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence budgeted $40 million for the Torture Report to be spliced, diced and redacted. The attorneys who did the "editing" were CIA-approved. 

I definitely recommend people read up on other commissions--*The Last Investigation* by Gaeton Fonzi does a great job of showing how the HSCA was controlled by the purse strings and manipulated by the CIA (false leads, excessive control of files, etc). The patterns used to undercut the commissions become more apparent when you read Philip Shenon's *The Commission* directly after. (I do recognize there are weak aspects of Shenon's work which David Ray Griffin (?) has pointed out.) 




 LBJ definitely knew he was dying--possibly he felt betrayed by the country or the press or the CIA or the Pentagon for his failure in Vietnam.  Being President wasn't the dream job he had always hoped for. Odd that he would say "The American people had enough of Presidents dying in office."  




 Until I watched a C-Span panel discussion earlier today, I never realized that LBJ admitted this not once--but twice.  [L. Fletcher Prouty mentioned this *Atlantic* article](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4532917/l-fletcher-prouty-describes-jfk-assassination-conspiracy). LBJ does seem to be drunk or heavily medicated in the [CBS interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfFMUWg39WU), but a second admission to a reporter at his ranch is significant--especially since LBJ was very guarded after he left DC. 

I finally watched *Rich Man's Trick* for the first time a few weeks ago--which confirmed one of my biggest suspicions (that the JFK limo almost came to a stop). The Secret Service agent who ran up to the JFK limo was always a red flag for me.

The *Atlantic* article also mentions that reporters would question LBJ about where he was on the night of the 23rd--any ideas about the significance of this? It also reminds me of how Dick Cheney was absent in the weeks following 9/11 (except for arranged press interviews).

 I posted this article which investigates corporate (Council on Foreign Relations-Manhattan Institute) ties to U.S. agencies FBI-DHS-NSA...(got downvoted)...(scroll down for article)

 Background: during the 50's and 60's the CIA recruited members of the National Student Association (NSA) inside the U.S. 

The recruits made reports on foreign students inside of the U.S. but also helped recommend U.S. citizens (college students) to recruit. 

Later it became clear that the NSA was funded by the CIA.

The NSA worked both in the U.S. and internationally.
