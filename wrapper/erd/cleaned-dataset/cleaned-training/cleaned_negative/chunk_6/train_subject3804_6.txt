 I awoke to my alarm. I quickly dressed myself and drove the 15min commute to work. 

All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before. 

I arrived at my workplace and checked in with security. The guard gave me a simple "Good Morning" as I saluted her with my own "Good Morning". After a couple of ID swipes and automated doors, I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. 

All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before. 

I browsed my daily online news articles, then jumped on reddit to read my daily subs. When someone passed my cubicle, I would quickly switch over to an online HTML tutorial. I've read it several times, but I didn't want anyone to know I was goofing off.

All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before. 

The line for coffee was long. Some people looked like they were dragged out of bed. Others were too chipper to be natural. How do they do it? Was it just a mask they wore, hiding their tired, grouchy nature? I drudged to the front of the line and got my coffee. 

All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before. 

I had a brief meeting with my supervisor. She droned on about deadlines, quality, work ethics, and the rest. I nodded my head every so often to appear attentive. I drew funny doodles in my notebook whenever she said something that appeared to be important. The meeting finally ended, and I traveled back to my cubicle. 

All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before. 

I gave away 8hrs of my life for $80 minus the government's pound of flesh. I clocked out and walked through the endless cycle of automatic doors and ID swipes. As I left, the security guard gave me a cheerful "Have a good day" as I saluted her the same. 

All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before. 

I arrived at my house and sat down in front of my computer. I browsed my nightly news articles, then jumped on reddit to read my nightly subs. I played a few games of Hearthstone and CS-GO. 

All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before. 

As I rested in bed, I kept thinking upon the days events. All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before. I recalled every minute of day with such clarity, as if I had re-read this page over and over again. 

I had been feeling like this for the past 5 years now. Every day, the same old routine. Like cogs in a machine, I only fit in with the daily turn. Not tomorrow though. Tomorrow would be different. As I told myself that, I knew I had said those words before.  




 Wow, I remember hearing a show on the radio yesterday about a guy being doused in gasoline and then roasted alive. 

What are the odds?
