 Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House intelligence committee, said last week that Chinese intelligence agencies have for some time been seeking to assemble a database of information about Americans. Those personal details can be **used for blackmail**, or also to shape bogus emails designed to appear legitimate while **injecting spyware** on the networks of government agencies or businesses Chinese hackers are trying to penetrate.

Interesting that he believes all of that. I don't recall him advocating against NSA gathering all of the same information about Americans because of those same reasons. Oh right, the "good guys" would never use that same information for those purposes. 
























 I hear "torture works" - maybe try that to make them tell us? 
























 What's there to "study"? High-end smartphones should've had it since the first half of this year - one of the more disappointing aspects about Galaxy S6 and other flagships. 



















 Not just privacy...but security. You know how encryption would've protected the OPM data? 









 Was yours a secret Court, too? 





























 Which is exactly why tuition prices have spiraled out of control - thanks to the government guaranteeing the loans, no matter how much they hike up the price. 




 Automatic breaking is one of the nice side-effects of research into self-driving cars, and I expect a lot more like it to spill over into "regular" cars in the near future. 




 ZeroCash aims to fix that, but it's not quite finished yet I think. 

















































 Not the "Internet", the 100 or so websites they will allow in their Internet.org project. 




 Facebook does that with like 90% of its announced products. I don't know why people even make a big deal about some of them when they get announced at this point. 

















































 Wait a minute...I thought only child pornographers and terrorists need encryption? What are they implying if they move to encrypting all the sites now ?! 




 This is still valid? I thought Google moved away from that a while ago? 









 Does this ROM have anything to do with this? https://guardianproject.info/

 And yet somehow others managed to stole all federal employees' data.

NSA's actions: both illegal *and* completely worthless. 



















 That's not true. All of Intel's mobile chips are normally significantly more expensive than the ARM equivalents, but they get subsidized for devices.

 




 The chip is more like ~1.3GHz with Turbo-Boost up to 2.3Ghz. The max speed isn't always activated.

Also, the fact that Intel has to do emulation for many apps means that the chip will perform less well than otherwise, and it will also [consume more power](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/02/arm_test_results_attack_intel/):

 The results weren't pretty: when using binary translation on this CPU-centric benchmark, power consumption went up nearly 90 per cent and performance dipped by over 40 per cent. 




 Probably just to catch their own [manufactured terrorists](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/02/26/fbi-manufacture-plots-terrorism-isis-grave-threats/), too.

My advice? Stop giving their idiotic ideas prime time (whether in the media or on Reddit). Don't let their propaganda spread. Just ignore it. 




 The future (in the long term) seems to be to "decentralize everything". I think energy will have to be decentralized as well, which is good not just for individuals but nations as well as they won't have to depend on other countries for oil and such. 
























 I've been asking for YEARS that Google should make a "PC interface" for Android, and then when you connect the phone to a monitor, it would show you that. 

The same could work with a TV, to show you the Android TV interface, although it would have to happen wirelessly otherwise no one will bother. 

















































  It would be nice in the future if there was an internet permission that somehow allowed ads while blocking everything else, although this would obviously be quite complicated

I don't think it would be complicated at all. They could probably just open up a special port on Android that only works for ads. Plus, Google owns Admob, which represents lie 75% of the ads on Android apps, so they could "force" the change pretty easily. 









 Android's ~50% market share in the US hasn't changed for at least the past 2 years, maybe 3.

It's just that in the winter holiday season, the iPhone manages to get like 5% or so extra market share, and then Android drops to 47-48%, and many Apple-loving tech sites point to that as "Apple growing and Android losing" in the US. But then they fail to write about how the numbers jump back up to over 50% for Android a quarter later. 







































 This happens all the time too - I mean those connected to the NSA for instance, leaking classified information to the media that makes the NSA or the government *look good*. But somehow nobody is calling for *those* people to be put for "endangering national security" in prison or even assassinated for leaking the data.

I think it's even emerging as some kind of litmus test. Are those in the media trying to discredit the personality of the leaker and call for his assassination or arrest? Then it must be great leak for the population. If not, then the government probably had a hand in it and is trying to manipulate us through that leak. 




 In other words, Android Pay is nowhere near as private as Apple Pay. Got it. 




 They've had like 3 or 4 restructurings so far. 














 Just some bad apples.  



















 Encryption is for the elites. The rest of you are basically two steps (or should I say "hops"?) away from becoming terrorists. 




 tl;dr: "We apologize - we should've done more lobbying in the EU." 




 This also includes things like banning the Disconnect app from the store (anti-tracking protection).

Google can only claim stupidity for so long on such actions. Was it also stupidity or a mistake when they banned ALL adblockers from the store? I don't think so.

They *should* be punished for stuff like that. 














 I think they've been saying that since 2011. 
























 What makes you think he was joking? I'm pretty sure that's exactly the *main* reason for why he wants to kill the Human Rights Act, but he's selling it to the public as something else.

For instance, Cameron and Tories hardly mentioned their surveillance plans during the election, so they got elected for different reasons, but within a week of getting elected passing new surveillance laws seems to be by far the main priority of the party. So why wouldn't you think that's the main reason for killing the HRA too? 




 "We have always been at war with Eastasia."

"We have never been at war with Iraq." 


































 If you need a free VPN for your phone, [Opera Max](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.max hl=en) provides exactly that and it even allows you to block apps from connecting to the Internet on their own. However, it only works on Android right now. It also  compresses data in about half, which is actually its primary objective. 




 As usual, Microsoft is more about misleading people than doing something real. They purposefully chose the "holo" name to mislead people into thinking it's a hologram - for marketing purposes. That says a lot about Microsoft's honesty as a company. 
























 Moore's Law. 




 If only the US government wasn't so anti-strong security and anti-encryption for the sake of making spying easier. Even as we speak, the FBI is spreading its anti-encryption propaganda on WashingtonPost and other such media sites. 
























 I like how this came out right after Obama patted himself on the back for signing the "surveillance reform he has been requesting for many years", exposing him as a liar and hypocrite (not that I believed him prior to this article, but still nice to see this thrown in his face so he stops with that charade). 



















































































































































































 You mean other than being heavily influenced by the NSA? 




  Homeland Security Committee Chairman warns that encryption is a tremendous threat to the homeland. 

That sounds a lot like something Russia would say. Just replace homeland with motherland. 







































 Probably not. 




 We need to go BIGGER! 




 I wonder if 50 years from now it's new genetically modified humans that will have kill switches in them... 




 OOOH SNAP! 




 I think it's important we at least make it explicitly clear in laws what they can and can not do. The problem is they may be using other programs or have different interpretations, which is why transparency and oversight is also very important. So we need to get more people like Ron Wyden in the Intelligence Committees, and fewer people like Dianne Feinstein, so we can know if they are actually obeying the laws as intended or not.

We also need to *actually cut* NSA's funding by a significant margin (at last half say over the next 3 years). I mean if we're going to stop some of the major "mass surveillance" programs, then they won't need as much budget, right?! Otherwise if we leave them that budget they could just restart the *same* programs under different names and in different locations. Starve the NSA of resources to the point where it *only* has the necessary resources for targeted surveillance. There should also be regular audits (twice a year) of NSA's expenses by the Intelligence Commitee's staff.

So it's not impossible to rein on the NSA. But it does require a lot of political will and some good systems in place to ensure that they *can't* now that they "won't" do some stuff.

We also need to *start punishing people*, even with prison, when they break those laws, which again requires political will, and therefore a lot of activism from us. 




 I wonder if in the past year or so, worrying that the Patriot Act might actually expire, the NSA/FBI started putting everyone "under investigation" just so it can continue spying on all when the Patriot Act expires, thanks to this "grandfathering" feature.
