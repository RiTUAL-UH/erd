 Boondock Saints: Two misogynistic religious fanatics from another country execute countless American citizens without a trial; the public remains divided. 




 I don't think an exact fraction has been named, but giving even half of the sale of your life's work to charity is pretty cool. 









 Also my band Plastic Fifth is opening, so shameless plug. 




 yup 




 Backstory: We thought a "cooking" picture would be funny, but the accidental grease fire was much funnier 




 You're suggesting that his misspoke in all instances linked to above? Yeah, I guess that's technically possible. But I think it's more likely that all politicians feel comfortable with some degree of deliberate distortion. 




 Merriam Webster definition of Lie: "to make an untrue statement with intent to deceive."

I doubt Obama was really trying to pull one over on us with that one. 




 Did you check out my links? 




 It isn't hard to find comprehensive lists of any candidates' lies; check out many of Romney's [here](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mitt-romney/statements/byruling/false/) and [here](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mitt-romney/statements/byruling/pants-fire/).

 That's nuts. 




 Criterion's occasional mainstream releases often help finance their Euro/art offerings, and have the potential to spread awareness of the company's mission to a broader base. Provided they're able to craft a compelling package that makes a case for the films' cultural and artistic merit, it shouldn't matter if they're widely popular or not, hipsters be damned. 




 If you like pop rock, they definitely have a few gems--[Change your Mind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-mW_0TUSy4) is a personal favorite. 




 I can't tell you how many times I've futilely started this film. 




 It doesn't feel all that secure to me--living in Lansing, I'm seeing huge roadside signs for Rogers, Romney and Ryan everywhere. Swing state or not, they're fighting for it. 




 That's a pretty grandiose take on it. 









 Watch good stuff/make bad stuff. That's how you get better at every creative endeavor ever. 




 It always seems strange when people do blatantly phony stuff like this for cameras, especially in this day and age--an olde timey photo op is not the only source of information anymore. 




 ain't no "one of" here, Debando. You're fucking a hundred duck horses. 




 While a very interesting and detailed read, I don't think there's much evidence that Caden committed suicide. The film is obviously surreal and obsessed with death, but it doesn't seem to be governed by anything so concrete--relatively speaking--as purgatory. My two major objections:

1) Caden dies at the end. I would argue that exploring a confused, subjective and decidedly purgatorial life and death is a simpler, more elegant and more meaningful reality for the film than literalizing that purgatory and necessitating an unfocused set of rules for leaving it. Basically, there's no sense in killing the poor bastard twice.

2) There is no afterlife. This film was conceived as a horror film, and deals with all the worst fears a man like Caden can suffer, right up to the permanent disintegration of his tortured but solipsistic ego. Death is absolute, impersonal non-existence, and that is why it is terrifying. 




 or a therapist 














 Seriously. If strangers were excessively nice to a famous person on Reddit, then that would totally affect me somehow. 




 I appreciate that. :) Enough time has gone by that it's fine now, but it really was a surprisingly hurtful, emotional experience. 




 I hardly think this article qualifies as a comprehensive list. 




 home break-in actually, lost a ton of other electronics as well. still good advice though. 




 looks great! do you have any experience with it? 




 A few years ago my laptop was stolen, and it was pretty devastating. I quickly learned the value of backing up important files, but does anyone have any free/low-cost tips for physical laptop tracking and creating comprehensive backups on a multi-hundred gigabyte level? 




 *shhhhhhhhhhhh!* 




 I think it was a house of cards built on illogical and implausible scenarios, I think it violates its own logic throughout the movie, and it panders to the audience with cliche "chance" situations.

Oy. That's a different disagreement entirely.

Ah well, stalemate it is. I've done my best to provide some examples of this movie's unique qualities as differentiated from similar films, but there's nothing to be done about different, subjective reactions to the film's objective novelties. I *will* invite you to consider how your own favorite "original" works fare by the standard you're applying here, but I do concur that we'll likely not agree on *Looper*. 




 Losing a hand is one thing, conscious ongoing torture of a future person through mutilation of their past self is quite another--by the same token, time regulation is one thing and time travel as an exclusively criminal enterprise is another as well. All time travel movies will have some things in common, much the same way that all Westerns or slashers do. A creative genre picture is measured by what the author does within those parameters. 




 Where, if I may ask, have you seen the torture and dismemberment through time travel scene before? That's certainly a watershed moment. :)

I would also be interested to know where, if anywhere, you've seen the organized use of time travel for criminal executions, which is of course the sci-fi premise that distinguishes the movie. The only thing I see that Looper and *12 Monkeys* (1995) or *Frequency* (2000) appreciably have in common is time travel.
 




 To be fair though, you can make literally everything this side of *Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat* sound derivative by reducing it to its broadest elements. The implied gore of the disappearing fingers, the completely unexpected curve into horror territory, the brutal simplicity of the executions, the little things like the Rainmaker's henchmen wearing the same clothes as the character on the poster on the young boy's wall. For me, it adds up to one of the most clever, surprising movie-going experiences of the year. 




 I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see an Original Screenplay nod, that's where the edgy/creative movies go. 




 It's entirely possible to feel sympathy for the professor and overwhelming relief that no one was hurt, and to laugh because it's such a bizarre situation. Go green! 




 Dinosaurs! 




 **FUCK YEAH I LOVE THEM!** 














 I think the point is that it's cool. 




 Yeah, you can tell it's a classy joint as soon as you walk in and see the glossy gold painted walls. 




 I'd just like to chime in in favor of signature flavor Sesquicentennial Swirl, a birthday cake and frosting flavor. 




 Welp, I'm convinced! Thank you, Bob Thompson! 




 By not giving a shit? 




 **I BROKE IT**. Feminist avant-garde filmmaker/dancer/actress Maya Deren [has no Bacon number](https://www.google.com/search?q=bacon+number+maya+deren).

Finally, my degree in film pays off. 




 on 9/11, yes. 




 No disrespect to the Special Olympics, but if someone earnestly asked you if you were going to participate, you'd probably be a little offended too. 




 I laughed at this, and then I thought the sentence "spaghetti is a lesbian," and then I laughed again. 




 Shit dude, you must be starving.

Oh, you mean the picture? That's not so bad. 




 Recently moved, and couldn't take my old TV with me. I cover TV shows for my second job, and I'd like to be able to switch between cable programming and some sort of PC input. Any help is much appreciated! 




 You win? 




 Fireside cats. 




 This strikes me as a reskinned, better articulated version of the classic r/atheism facebook post. Harumph. 




 Fine, I added three unessential words to the conversation. To be fair though, you added nineteen. ;) 




 You're not *universally* wrong, but it's worth exploring how systemic socio-economic pressures shape perception of such opportunities, how effort toward "self-improvement" offers vastly different pay-offs depending on one's starting lot in life, and your own role in the cyclical, real-word social climate propagated through the trite dismissal of the disadvantaged as "lazy." 




 Their [interview with Kubrick](http://paulnahm.blogspot.com/2010/06/playboy-interview-wstanley-kubrick-in.html) is another great non-boob related Playboy article.

 tl;rd: i don't like all these i-gadgets, but that Jason Mraz fella is pretty good! 




 Yeah, the Onion/A.V. Club video player is pretty flaky. Here it is on the contest's [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BlynQBynQI feature=plcp) and on my personal [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/46409913).

 Assuming you're talking about the [tilt-shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt%E2%80%93shift_photography) effect, you can achieve the opposite by making your focus as deep as possible. 




 I believe in plain speaking, foolishnesss. What does "look up Lisa Ferentz" mean? Her institute doesn't appear to offer a Master's program; are you saying that you know her personally, studied under her, or are actively pursuing a trauma certificate?

Regardless, it seems that we're talking past each other. You're describing a hypothesis, and I'm saying that there's no evidence for it. This is compounded by the testibly valid prevalence of false memory--something we both appear to acknowledge--to the extent that "recovered" memories, being indistinguishable to the subject from false ones, should bare no legal, medical or personal weight without objective corroborating evidence. 




 You know, like a masters level class...

What, is this a hypothetical? What is your Master's degree in? What department was this class in at what university? Have you taken this class? Who was the instructor, and what are his/her credentials? 

With regard to your questions:

A) Compare the memory to the objective facts. *Conscious* memory has proven time and again to be surprisingly malleable; "repressed" memory has yielded no provable information to my knowledge. Citations to the contrary are welcome.

B) The brain is a magnificent organ, but it's understandably not great at gauging its own accuracy. Simple as that.

The description of repressed memories as things people "think they think" is reasonably accurate. We code our memories in fairly broad strokes, and unknowingly update the context and details in accordance with our changing understanding of events. When the friendly policeman or the authoritative Freudian suggests that the subject was abused by Satan, he/she slowly and unwittingly updates their memory to comply with their evolving perspective. 




 I don't know what "counseling class" means, but my understanding from five or six psychology courses over the past few years is that A) there's significantly more testable evidence for fabricated memories than there is for repression, and B) *if* repressed memories exist, they're not reliably distinguishable from fabrications, and are therefore not useful in any real sense. 




 [Here you go!](http://imgur.com/9ENJ9) I'm of much the same mind here; I'd like to balance out the hundred of roadside signs everywhere. 
























 is there any answer in particular you were looking for? if I say "ur right no difference," will you give me an asker's best and 500 yahoo points? 




 Nearly every single Beatles song by either is [credited to both](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney). You are correct, however, as that verse is [generally accepted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Better#Composition) as Lennon's. 




 you're getting a lot of shit, but people who think of him exclusively as "badassery and Jack Daniels" are looking at his career pretty selectively. What exactly is bad-ass about "[Daddy Sang Bass?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGUP8oc9Bgs)" 




 Bullshit. This is about consumer sovereignty: if a business engages in a practice you strongly oppose, then you organize a public boycott.The average American citizen doesn't have a ton of of political power, but we sure as fuck have this.

You say "opinion" like these are a bunch of riled up Packers fans or something. No. This is about sending a legal, moral message that bigotry doesn't pay. 




 New protest strategy: serve free competitor chicken outside the store. Undercuts profits, helps the consumer, another opportunity to spread awareness. Not sure about food service regulation issues, but potential media exposure could balance it out. 




 The A.V. Club has a [weekly column](http://www.avclub.com/articles/cake-boss-evolves-on-comedy-bang-bang-and-the-bugl,83349/) on audio podcasts, not too sure about resources for video though. 




 AAaaaa aaaa aass-fucked by debt. 




 bit on the nose, eh? 




 Here's his [blog post](http://www.allegiancemusical.com/blog-entry/keep-myself-physically-strong-mentally-awake-and-morally-straight) on the matter. 




 I'm reading all of his comments in the spazziest, slurringest voice possible. 




 Jimmy Fallon has joined Justin Timberlake in my Small Club of People Who Are Much Cooler Than I Initially Thought. 




 I think you're right that the openness limits growth, and I think that that's completely fine. When "growth" trumps an open forum for provocative and edifying content, I'll leave. 




 There's a monumental difference between supporting the right and advocating the message, one which Hines establishes clearly and is following consistently. I don't think his actions make much sense in the context of what Reddit is as a whole, but it's ridiculous to claim he is in any way opposed to "the right to free speech." 




 Christopher Tin: How do you approach a new composition? Do you start with a melody, a general sound or instrumentation, a chord progression? How involved are project leads in the conception and shaping of your music? 




 If getting optioned in the studio system is the goal then I don't disagree, but you can follow whatever rules you want if you produce independently, which is fairly feasible these days. Study and criticism are hugely important to any creative endeavor, but breaking the rules doesn't have to mean "you're doing it wrong, rewrite" if you're willing to make a film yourself and good/lucky enough for it to make an impact on somebody. :) 




 That depends entirely on your goals as a writer and in life. 




 Chaplinesque 




 It delivers on the theme of hope, for one, as Batman's memory lives on. As for doubting validity elsewhere, Ra's Al Ghul's ghostly appearance is almost certainly a tortured fantasy. 




 One which didn't conflict with the clear, unambiguous depiction of him sitting in the cockpit four seconds before a nuclear explosion--I realize that people are saying it's a temporal shift or something, but that would be an unprecedented break from the film's established editing style and would be jarringly out of place. As it stands, Bruce either deliberately killed himself in spite of having fixed the autopilot, or is a god. Those last thirty seconds are an unfortunate bit of nonsense capping an otherwise incredible, amazing film. 




 With respect to your addition: coercing someone into driving drunk *is* morally wrong by the exact same standard, and one could easily imagine a situation in which the coercer is found liable for wrongful death or guilty of manslaughter, particularly if they're sober. While conceivable, however, the idea of a sober person coercing a drunk person to drive for their own selfish interests strikes me as so uncommon as to be negligible. 




 Because no one understands what we do in western society besides other philosophers.

That is a massive failure on philosophy's part in no uncertain terms. 




 This really drives home for me how old Redditors are. 




 Fair enough. I would still point out that Man *does* imply adulthood relative to Boy, which is the context Ardenfrost initially used it in. Also, I didn't mean to use the "pompous ass" label as an argument for or against any specific points, just as a friendly personal note on the tone of the discussion--that's why I separated it from my content-based arguments with "on a personal note." :)
