 "Fantastic at compiling fake job histories and references" 




 Someone posts the same question every other day it seems 




 Yes people can. Would you like to be bound by something you said 2-3 years ago? 




 Polaris would have nothing to do with it, but yeah, they made it into a makeshift studio. Mark hangs out there a lot.

 




 No, none of that should take 20 minutes. And that's not even real editing, that's just overlaying text, and if that takes you 20 minutes, then you might want to consider a different field. Plus, if you use the same font and color every video (like the Grumps do) then you would have it saved as a preset, reducing a 2 minute job to 2 seconds. Keyframing text to fly in does not take a lot of time, though it would vary, it shouldn't take longer than a minute (and consider that it happens once per episode ON OCCASION) 

With the format of editing Kevin is given, using primarily presets and an assembly-line style of churning out episodes, there is no reason he should have messed up any of the times people have counted (other than laziness) The only time he's even responded to people's criticisms is when it legitimately wasn't his fault (an episode being six minutes long) 




 just because "it's the internet" and it's what people have come to expect, doesn't mean it should be that way and that nobody should focus on improving it 




 If they brought in someone that was funny, I think it'd be better.

Plus, it's only Ross that's played with them, so you haven't seen them play off of anyone else 




 Remove the last one, then replace Kevin with Holly and I'd watch it 




 That would be the best series imaginable! This was one of my favorite PS2-era games, I forgot it existed, I'm gonna go look up and see if I can buy it somewhere! Thank you!

(And like everyone else saying this: It would HAVE to include Dan, so either him on Grumpcade or a series on GG) 




 I'm sure VentGrumps has a good list going. Mostly from what I've seen, people say "Kevin edit this in" and he doesn't 




 Every edit that he's missed or messed up on takes about a minute or two to complete.

Source: I'm an editor 




 oh yeah, I forgot about that.... this might suck then 




 I get it! :) 




 He's just a watered down Pewdiepie to me. Neither of them are funny in any way 




 Well, it's already been debunked quite a few times. Didn't even think it was still a fad. I'm amazed he's on it, considering that he seems to think of himself as educated 




 Or he could just be at their office again.

God, I hope this guy is never on GG 




 I don't think working on something with the Grumps and this project are mutually exclusive. It's not too distracting of a task to stop into the Grump office for two hours to be a guest on their show 




 he's not forced to do anything by a Multichannel Network, they'll just recommend certain collaborations and deals to him, likely providing him incentive to meet their requests.

He probably just hates Los Angeles, most people do, honestly.


But I agree with you, the Polaris collaborations are so pointless. Most people don't know the majority of their partners and most of them are kinda the same youtube channel, producing the same content under a different name. But I'm willing to bet this isn't a Polaris project, but a JonTron project that he requested Polaris's help in scheduling/contacting these other youtubers 




 look, dude, I understand it's just a joke, but I can't suspend my disbelief entirely!

**At his job?** Seriously? Jokes have to have SOME sort of basis in reality here 




 Dude, you gotta follow through with the setting and details: For example:

"In prison." 




 Hopefully this raises awareness enough for people to not put their fucking change collection in an unprotected container in a bathroom! 




 Only funny if it's not a parent or a relative. Just some guy 




 fire 




 probably some kind of "look at this neat trick I can do" video 




 That's some funny goat-related humor! :D 




 Everybody shut up! This post has given me an erection! 




 I think it'd be more likely that he ditches it for his two bands and other projects full time, along with moving to Cali. But perhaps there's also an available physicist job out there? 




 Lol, I had a webseries in mind that was a parody of Dungeons Dragons type stuff that would use this joke.

This is the only sub where I figured I wouldn't get downvoted for using it 




 I created the joke. I always thought it'd be funny if some actual racist people in a fantasy setting referred to them as "Shadow People" 




 It's just a joke, dude 




 lol, "I left mah lyrics at home, nigga!" 




 They're like people, but their skin color is the color of a shadow 




 Kinda funny. Could've been a little clearer 




 Did they sink? 




 Shadow People 




 Argonians 




 I actually want to hear the full song 




 He's black. Blacks (aka, the Shadow People) stereotypically abandon their offspring (mostly just the males though) 




 E.T... phone Health Insurance Agency... 




 I'm not enjoying it. It has some funny moments here and there, but I hate when they talk about the games, which they're doing a lot of here (unless the game is interesting, which Bloodborne does not appear to be.) I was actually thinking about getting it, till they started playing it and I realized how boring and repetitive it seems

Edit: Don't forget to downvote if you disagree with me, cumfaggots :) 




 Other than Dave Chappelle and Ron White, I don't like a single one of those or a single joke I've heard from anyof them 




 Write a youtube comment demanding that he come back. 




 Ya know what bugs ME? Steel Panther is in it. God, they suck 




 Then name me some funnier ones 

(This is not confrontational, I'd actually like to discover some if you happen to name any I haven't heard) 




 lol, that story is what sold me on Jim Jefferies. i saw bits and pieces of his anti-religion stuff, but when I listened to the album that one was on, I realized he can be funny with any subject matter. His TV show is pretty good too 




 The funniest Stand-Up Comedian Alive Today 




 And a shapeshifter (He's actually Danny in his spare time) 




 Jon's getting a sex change operation  




 Beej 2: The *coming* of JonTron 




 As much as stoners like to THINK they are funny or interesting when they're high, they're not. I don't think a single one of them even smokes weed (excluding Danny, who used to) and despite Stout Train existing, none of those episodes were good at all. (And I LOVE alcohol, so I thought it would be interesting, at least if they discussed it)

I wouldn't mind a Drunk Grumps with just Dan and Arin, especially if it's Arin's first time being drunk, but it would have to be a chill, non-obnoxious episode and not act all stupid-drunk like Barry and Ross did. Something more along the lines of Toon Grumps would be interesting. (I mean, they can play games, but be FAR less into whatever is on the screen)

But stoned? Sorry, but I'd skip over an episode of them just laughing uncontrollably for no reason and talking about how hungry they are. 




 That would be the most horrible edition of Game Grumps in its entire history 




 Yep, played it last week. It's aged beautifully and I don't think a single Mario game has topped it since 




 Anyone know when he'll be on Sleepy Cast? I'm more excited for THAT 




 I know, right!? How can they not know shit about the dude who invented **Salad!?** 




 incorrect statement 




 Complaining can get annoying can't it?

Maybe now you understand why we don't like his bullshit with this game (An insanely easy game to master) 




 FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T STICK THAT THING IN MY ASSHOLE!!! PLEASE!! I'll sacrifice the lives of my children if you leave my anus intact! 




 Does this look RARE to you!?!? This steak should've been mooing a little when you set my plate down! 




 fuck, shoulda read the comments first. i posted the same thing 




 Et Tu, Brute? .....and vice versa? 




 This doesn't suck at all! 




 "Your performance in this position has been unsatisfactory and I'm afraid we'll have to let you go"


"Whatever! Come at me, SCRUB-LORD, I'm Ripped!" 




 The Second Endless Ocean is my personal favorite. They're both at the top of their comedic game in that one. That's the first episode of GG I've rewatched (haven't finished it yet though. Been meaning to start it where I left off) 




 lol, dude, Game Grumps doesn't have a parent company and you're reading WAAY too much into them going on vacation. Do you know how much Starbomb albums have sold? They can afford multiple vacations 




 2 is the only good one anyway. If he played the first one I can see why he hate it.

I'd like to see a Spyro game on Grumps. Danny seems to love dragons and shit like that, so that could stir up some passionate discussion 




 He should get one or two stars from each, then fight Bowser 




 My fellow Americans... this nation is------ **I'll be right back!** 




 "Well kids, sorry, but that's the seventh night in a row... you know what that means!"

"We have to eat the firstborn?"

"That's right... Cody, you get a 10-second head start. RUN!"



(Arin.... how do you **LIVE** with yourself!?!?) 




 If you watch Grumps for the gameplay, then something is seriously wrong with you.

However, it isn't entertaining if someone keeps making the same fuck-up over and over and over and over again and blames the game for it. Not because I'm watching the gameplay and I want to see progression, but because the conversation becomes stagnant, and it's just annoying to hear Arin ~~bitch about~~ er- "analyze" video-games.

Personally, I can't even stand when they talk about games at all, because for the most part, they aren't funny about it. But there were a few episodes recently where the fuck-ups actually were hilarious. Maybe they just need to learn to edit some moments out like that. If there are a bunch of fuck-ups that are funny, leave em in. If not, then just cut out that footage, and use the star selection screen as a point of transition, that way nobody knows anything was edited out

Just treat the show like a podcast that uses video-games to inspire discussion and it's entertaining. Otherwise, not so much. Arin and Danny are both super funny guys and I don't watch GG to see them beat games. It'd be better if they stopped playing them every time they weren't having fun 




 I can't stop laughing at this! :D 




 Ah, an illiteracy joke. Clever :) 









 Probably not that far from their real-life relationship 




 did this work? 




 Here's a copy of my resume... You'll find that I did some work for a little organization called "FoxNews..." so I have plenty of experience of instilling fear in the hearts and minds of Conservatives. I heard you have a lot of them down here.

"Same Boss Fight Every Time" is a recurring Staple of the Mario series 




 I think it's just that it can't be only Dan and Arin. Then it would be a Game Grumps serial 




 It's being edited. It's an actual project, not just a Let's Play. These things take time. Perhaps Barry is the editor and perhaps it got delayed because he felt overwhelmed by *real* editing work. Perhaps it's just a really huge/long project and they don't want to start uploading until it's all done.  

But Ross has answered posts like this multiple times with a resounding "yes, it is coming" 




 Literally the most plausible theory I've seen on the matter
