Thank you and keep the videos coming. 




 Emergency fund = cash. 




 You have to piece meal it all together. jQuery and Knockout are libraries, not frameworks.

Knockout gives you two-way data binding.

jQuery gives you a x-browser abstraction for events, DOM manipulation, ajax and animation (high level overview, of course). 




 No back support = not designed for sitting. 




 This is why you keep receipts. 




 In theory, the benefits of everything that comes with either of those frameworks (MVC/structure, two-way data binding, SPA/routing, testing, documentation, etc).  I'm pretty adamant that right now is just the wrong time for us to do a new app in Angular given what we have to support. 




 We've actually used Knockout on a mobile app here, though it's a bit of a pseudo SPA.  I think what Knockout does, it does well, but it obviously is very limited in what it does do. 




 We have a couple developers here who are throwing around the idea of rewriting an ~ 2 year old app in Angular. It's currently a JSF (Java Server Faces app). I don't think Angular 1.2 is a very good idea at this time and I'd like to hear opinions/justifications by those much smarter than myself.

**We have to support IE8** (we dropped IE7 last year, so not very long ago) and it looks like this would mean we'd need to use Angular 1.2. This is a minor version behind the *current* release of 1.3.

I've read the Angular team plans 1.5 - 2 years of support for Angular *1.3*, but we most likely wouldn't be able to update due to needing IE8 support.  This, to me means we'd essentially be hitting production with a deprecated framework.

As for when we could drop IE8 support and have IE9 as a baseline, that's pretty tough to say.  If 1.3 is supported for 2 years, I would guess it might be possible to upgrade any 1.2 app to 1.3 in 2 years, but then we're back to upgrading to a deprecated framework.

Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x is also a big unknown at this time.  I've read that is an unknown upgrade path as well as the angular team plans to work on an upgrade path.  With the fundamental changes in 2.x, it seems any 1.x to 2.x upgrade will be quite a bit of rewriting, if not mostly a full rewrite.

So I could see it being yet another rewrite in a couple years, which seems a bit ludicrous.

We've never built anything in Angular 1.x, either.  I've done a personal project in 1.3 but that was just to go from reading about Angular to actually doing *something* in it.  This is not saying much as I read and play with a lot of stuff just to go from a 50,000 foot view to a 25,000 foot view.

I've looked at Ember as well, which looks like we'd be topping out (with IE8 support) at [Ember 1.13. They also claim an upgrade to 2.x will be "relatively simple" when you can drop IE8 support](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/45#issuecomment-93009469).

Ember looks like a better choice to me at this particular point in time, but I'd love to hear what you guys would do if you were in enterprise land, needed to support IE8 (for the next couple of years at least) and wanted to build some type of modern MV* app.

 Ajax (what $.load() uses) needs to be run via a webserver (not the file protocol) and you'll want to be loading files from the same domain, or else you'll need to look into CORS (cross origin resource sharing), which is a separate set of issues if you don't control all the domains in play. 




 I frequently see this from our back-end java and sometimes .NET guys, so I'm assuming the authors of that guideline came to the front-end via the back-end, i.e., they're your typical computer science guys.  




 Sure, just setup a partial html page that other pages can consume and use jquery's load method.

    $( "#elem-on-parent-page" ).load( "path/to/page-to-load-into-parent.html" );

If you only want to load part of the page-to-load-into-parent.html page:

    $( "#elem-on-parent-page" ).load( "path/to/page-to-load-into-parent.html #container" );

Where #container is just the parent element you want to consume. When you have a space after the url, it acts as a jquery selector so the above is loading page-to-load-into-parent.html then filtering it down to just the element with the id of container.

 Hi frenz. 









 and I'm now following up with scans of 3 of 10 coins I received

Since my original post I've ordered 20oz ASE from another vendor and all arrived without any visible fingerprints or other defects

I think this is key.  In your latter example you ordered a tube so you are most likely getting the coins as they left the mint. Some vendors may go through tubes and cherry pick what they think are the best to send out for grading but I think you have a much better chance with condition by buying in tubes.

What vendor did you purchase the 10 from?

 Are you aware the 2.0 version is not going to be backwards compatible with 1.x? There are major differences between 2.0 and 1.x. You might want to hold off until 2.0 is out before learning a framework (1.x), only to relearn it next year (2.0).

 I don't think those dates are critically important other than the PR angle.  I think they have something like 30 days or 6 weeks to make the payments before they are considered to be in default, so we're talking mid-end May.

 I have a 10 oz Rarities bar, didn't pay too much of a premium for it.  Your 5 oz would probably fetch $100, IMO. That would be a "retail" price, i.e., to someone like the folks here. If you were to sell it to some type of retail establishment, you'd probably get $15-20 less, I'd guess.

I don't know if the 5 oz is particularly rare. I'd guess not so much but can't really speak with any authority. You don't see the Rarities bars much, but I don't think they're that collectible outside of being an older type of silver bar.

 There's a faction here that thinks when APMEX has sales like this, it's foreshadowing spot price going down.

So let's watch what happens this week. We're at $1,189.40 as I type this on Monday eve.

I'm not finding any silver deals from them, though I'm just looking very quickly, filtering down to bullion--silver--uncertified--1 oz.  I see they have a tube of ASEs for $411 but not much of a deal.  JMB has them for $400 shipped at the moment. Silver spot is $16.82 at the moment so if I'm missing any APMEX silver deals, please post it up for the record.

 Or you are here protecting you investments. 

You'd be much better off, IMO, if you would have spent that $ on semi-numismatics.  With those generic APMEX bars, you're directly tied to spot price.  Take a look at the price of silver since 2011 - it has crashed.  What if you would have been doing your research then? Would you still have jumped in with the doom and gloom dollar collapse scenario that proliferates from the silver pumpers? Do you really think you'll find yourself in a silver barter situation?

For someone who has done a "ton of research" and "endless research", yet makes a large first purchase of generics, I'd say your research is failing you. I'm not bashing generics as I have generics, but you really need to be aware of what you're buying. Diversification can be fun, but that doesn't mean it will yield you the greatest gains.

I would strongly suggest researching and getting into semi-numismatics where your silver won't be tied to the spot price of silver, which may not have bottomed yet.

Welcome aboard the silver train.
