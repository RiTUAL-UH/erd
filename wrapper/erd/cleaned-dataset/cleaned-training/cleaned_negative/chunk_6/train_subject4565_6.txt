 The track *Kid A* from Kid A should not have been 5 minutes long, though. Two minutes? Perfect. I'd love the album.    
I'd probably love it more if they replaced that track altogether with I Might Be Wrong (which was recorded in the same sessions) 




 I would adore In Rainbows if they left out Videotape. It's suicide-inducingly depressing and bleak.

 *every CW show* 




 She's unrecognisable in Game of Thrones. She's supposed to be this dark-haired, slim, long-legged [sexy badass](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/iceandfire/images/c/cf/Regodon-asha-greyjoy.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120213162523). They changed her name to Yara (because apparently Asha sounds too similar to Osha) and cast her as [differently](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130611131832/gameofthrones/images/3/34/Yara_Greyjoy_3X10.png) as possible (dirty blonde?). Not saying she's unattractive, she's just not Asha.    
(Edited for several bad grammars) 




 Who else used the flamethrower against the two assistant surgeons?! I did!    
No, really. My save counted 22 hours on Grounded difficulty - the elevator room fight aside David, among other scenes, took me hours to complete. I had to take it out on someone/thing in the end. 




 Stephen King's Wizard and Glass is amazing. Best Dark Tower book IMO. 




 Yeah, I mean, it's not like glasses are cute or anything, right? Total turn-off /s 




 Apparently Eric Clapton's son was quite an accomplished author. I heard he did more than fifty stories before he died. 




 When you get around to it, watch them in the order IV V II III VI. It's called the Machete Cut. Completely leaves out Episode I (1999). 




 Almost everything you said was answered... 




 *What was it that was so wrong with me? What about me?!* 




 It's also a Mass Effect quote. 




 Someone else might have gotten it wrong. 




 She's not even from New Zealand, her husband (the guy next to her) is. 




 Still, for me, the worst one is the one where you attack the fucking bots before they reach the hideout. How was that on Hero? 




 I thought it was hell on Earth trying to complete it on Normal, ffs. 




 I might be wrong. It's a fun read either way, no matter whether you read into the silly little references like I did. Go for it - it's a good book. 




 The Paiks would not have let Jin keep her. He's supposed to be dead, he's probably going to assume a false identity, and Mr Paik would probably put a hit out on him anyway. I think it was justified. 




 From my own personal experiences, you're probably onto something. 




 The Wind Through the Keyhole makes no sense. If Roland is telling the story as it's written, then all of the references within it to Sombra and the MiB are total retcons. That book made me so mad. 




 Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman have been trying to get it financed for years and years. Warner, Universal and MRC all passed on it. 




 I'd make *The Gunslinger x Wizard and Glass*.    
First 15 minutes - Tull.    
Next 100 minutes - The Gunslinger flashback + Wizard and Glass flashback.    
Next 35 minutes - The rest of The Gunslinger and the beginning of Drawing, with the injury + discovering Door One. 




 So everyone dies? 




 I can still respect Lost as my absolute favourite TV show of all time because its highs are so fucking gloriously high, but Season 6 was a total mess.    
Don't get me wrong : *I love the pseudo-religious bullshit*. The flash-sideways and the ending, IMO, were the perfect redemption for such a muddled-up final season. The Temple was a disappointment, Widmore was completely wasted, Ilana is one of the most misused TV characters of all time in my opinion, Sayid's death (if you think about it) is pretty racist, and Ben's character becomes unrecognisably apologetic and meek.     
I love the ending, but oh boy does the show take some pathetic missteps to get there. 




 [Radiohead - *Let Down*](https://youtu.be/-Z_NvVMUcG8). You'll get it when you listen. 




 With Hewitt. Harry's conception. 




 For me, it was the Remastered edition on Grounded difficulty. 60fps and higher stakes gave it this extra layer of realism that really broke me.    
Most cinematic game I've ever played (yes, Ubisoft, even with dat framerate). 




 I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF BENFORD GOT OUT OF THE BUILDING BEFORE IT BLEW UP, GODDAMNIT. 




 What did they say? 




 It stars Uncle fucking Bully. I wouldn't expect less. 




 Isn't *Airplane!* PG? Explicit boob shot in that flick, bouncing around, centred and in the foreground. 




 What song do you identify as something revelatory? How did it make you feel?    
Get real with me, here. 




 *You're a bisexual wizard, Harry.* 




 I will second that recommendation for Radiohead's  [OK Computer](https://youtu.be/w4GsSCfOeAk).

 The **Teletubbies** episode with [the fucking Bear and the fucking Lion](https://youtu.be/ASnh7_zSimU). First time as a child when I was truly terrified.    
Edit: Read the comments section of the video to get an idea of the effect this shit had  on people. 




 *"Hey, Scott!"*    
    
*"I'm Steve; Scott's dead."* 




 Palmerston North, New Zealand. *John Cleese* said that if someone's contemplating suicide but not quite sure yet, a trip to Palmy should settle it. 




 You'll end up really good at the game. My advice is, if you go for it, don't play Vanguard. I can imagine that being the worst possible class considering Charge constantly takes you out of cover. I'd probably suggest Infiltrator (though I played Soldier, which was probably a bad idea). 




 ***You get my father down here RIGHT NOW, and if I'm drunker than he is, you can fire me!***    
Knowing the context with the twist at the end makes this so much more sad. 




 *Hold me closer, tiny dancer...* 




 Furious 7 will make *a lot* of money, no doubt.    
That means nothing against the sequel to the third-highest grossing movie of all time, 




 It's 4:20, Saturday afternoon here in New Zealand. Too early to say. 




 Up until recently when it came on, it was the track [Kid A](https://youtu.be/7RwvZSfLUXM) by Radiohead.    
It made me depressed for the rest of the day; scariest thing I've ever heard. Fuck that song. Deleted it straight away. 




 [I know, right? Great song.](http://youtu.be/rDAjFstQrTk) 




 Christian.    
Not for any religious reasons at all, but I named my first Commander Shepard that after the character from **LOST**, and it's absolutely stuck as a name I really dig. 




 And if you're in New Zealand, you can watch it all on Lightbox. 




 [You mean Rick Grimes?](http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/B9BNAB1oilsl.jpg) 




 Not anymore. 




 The entirety of Mass Effect 2 on Insanity. I spent over two hours on the first combat checkpoint on the derelict Collector ship trap. Completing that game on Insanity with every squad member loyal and alive on my second ever playthrough of the game, and immediately seeing my first platinum trophy ever - best gaming experience ever.    
    
All of that frustration and anger totally paid off. I suck at hard games, but it can be rewarding/satisfying as fuck. 




 YOU AAAAAAALLL EVERYBODY    
and Dharma Lady 




 Enjoyment and anxiety 




 But Tali... 




 The first three seasons and the last three seasons are like two separate shows. The Season 3 finale is the perfect ending to the show as it's set up in the pilot, tying up as many character arcs as possible and doing away with the flashback structure which had been ingrained in the show since the very beginning.    
    
And then the sequel show begins - the final three seasons, during which the show went batshit fucking insane and lost tons of viewers. Not me, though - I loved it. 




 Episode 17: The Garden of Forking Paths, the one where Gibbons captures Demitri and forces Benford to race against time to save him - this was probably their best episode. Ironically, it was the first episode they aired after the show officially cancelled. 




 Massive LOST fan here. I disagree about the pilot. On rewatch, in comparison to the style and structure of the rest of the series, the pilot is super clumsy. It may have some eerie moments and tense scenes, but the dialogue and the directing are awkward and uneven. *Guys...where are we?* - I hate this line so much.    
Get to episodes like The Brig, Ab Aeterno, The Man Behind the Curtain, Through the Looking Glass, Jughead, Flashes Before Your Eyes or The Shape of Things to Come and the pilot is hilariously outmatched. 




 IMAX 




 This had better be international eventually. NZ PS+ shouldn't be the handicapped little brother of the big US PS+. We've been on the same level of value this whole time. Don't change that now, Sony. 




 Not quite my tempo. 




 Oh...*OH*...**OOHHH** 




 Is Cliff Curtis playing a Mori character, or are they pretending he's Mexican like in Training Day? 




 The exact episode he becomes sympathetic is episode 4.09. He went too fucking far by not coming out of the goddamn house. That whole "She's not my daughter" scene kills me. 




 It's about someone trying to try as hard as humanly possible to avoid seeing themselves as they really are. I loved it. 




 Tali, no contest. 




 **WE HAVE TO GO BAAAAACK!** 




 Juliet causes the pregnancy issues by detonating the bomb, giving the Others a reason to need a fertility expert in the first place. Faraday sets his entire life in motion by giving Eloise his notebook, which is the source of all of her wisdom. Locke was the one who told Richard to find him as a child, Richard believed him because Locke was a time traveller and in effect the reason the Others believed John was special is because John told them he was, giving MiB the perfect opportunity to kill Jacob. Ben helped get everyone on the plane, which gets Sayid back to the 70s where he shoots kid Ben, leading the Others to take him in and make him the person he becomes.

 *"Why do you find it so hard to believe?"*    
*"Why do you find it so easy?!"*    
***"IT'S NEVER BEEN EASY!"*** 




 IIRC that's Season 2 Episode 19, S.O.S. 




 **Lost**: The entirety of Season 5 is spent having its most of its characters cause their own misery. The whole thing is one big paradox without any rhyme or reason other than to cause itself. Faraday, Juliet, Locke, Ben (present and past) end up causing some of the most important events in their own lives believing they're doing work of the utmost importance, and instead setting off events which may end humanity.    
People in general looked past this, but it's fascinating how deep the irony goes. 




 Hey, not always. 




 Used to be obsessed with CoD Zombies 




 I wouldn't have thought of blind people to be big fans of eyes. 




 The flashback structure is so iconic for Lost, that it felt weird to watch another show do the same thing. 




 The post is called Watch Chappie, but the post was tagged as *Recommendation*. 




 *Go and see this movie or don't* isn't that groundbreaking a point. This post recommends a film, so we're supposed to take that as it is - someone we've never met adding a positive opinion to a divisive movie. That's worth something. There's no need to shoot it down. You'd be better off saying why you didn't like it, but you didn't give off the vibe you'd seen the thing. 




 The difference is that Chappie seems like it's trying to make statements about the nature of humanity, whereas John Wick is trying to be a simple fun action romp.  




 Could have been longer. Yes, it was very well polished and virtually bugless. But we could have had more enemy types, side missions more akin to inFamous 2, a longer, better story more comparable to the two previous games etc.    
Rushed job was a terrible choice of words on my part. 




 Both are well regarded. It's pretty much impossible for either to be underrated. 




 Second Son was a rushed job. I'd love a legitimate new inFamous game without such a weak, short story and filler side content. 




 He should do *The Dark Tower*. Get Ron Howard and Akiva "Winter's Tale" Goldsman the hell away from DT and let the best Stephen King director of all time work his magic. 




 The Russos are directing Infinity War, so unless Whedon is doing Captain Marvel, he's free. 




 *You* referring to the other guy, not me :) 




 It's not confirmed he'll be in SS, just BvS. Could you link the interview?     
(Even if I'm wrong, I still like reading) 




 It's most likely because the showrunners were part of the Lost writing staff for 5 years, and let's hope that's it. 




 The island all of Lost (bar two scenes) was filmed on. 




 Which also spells cock 




 Whiplash: *"Upswinging!"* 




 The story was sooooooo dull. Killed any tension for me. 




 Is there a Vita trophy list? 




 I still can't get over them calling a character Dick Rider. 




 :( 




 No one asked the obvious: *"How long is the movie?"* 




 *We have to go back, Kate! WE HAVE TO GO BACK!*

 [Fucking really, OP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2xi7pe/what_phrase_makes_you_cringe_every_time_you_hear/) 




 I think you might be getting the wrong idea from that phrase.

 You also find out that he got her pregnant and she has a daughter named Clementine that he never visited. I hope that happens in Focus. 




 It's happening because it's a cue from a recent surprise box office success, not because the idea's new.
