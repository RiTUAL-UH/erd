 Dear god, please hear my prayer and Figgy's too. Please make [this](http://scolgin.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/bacon-tree.jpg) happen, Amen.

 I [fixed](http://i.imgur.com/S3VWSsm.png) it! 




 I have not, She has a plastic fetish too so this is an excellent Idea. I'm going to try it! 




 This is very true, you said it so well too. I do appreciate the effort it takes for my cats affection, It's like playing a really hard level to beat in a video game. It's frustrating but when you actually beat the level you feel accomplishment. But instead of a feeling of accomplishment you get affection. 




 Excellent read, Touching story. Good on you for treating this sad individual to some human respect by visiting his grave. He had no-one and now he has you to remember him. 




 I have a female cat "Babs" I bought her a 30$ Cat Bed all plush, soft inviting and what not. She knows it's for her, she acknowledged it but sleeps not on it but in front of it... Cats are dicks but we love them. Why?

 Shut up Meg!

 Exactly what I was thinking, Mini-Amphitheater!

 Ok, Now I feel bad. Have an upvote. 




 Nancy Grace? 




 The chair on the left bottom is an asshole, I had one on my biology class that would pinch the hell out of your leg! 




 Thank you. 




 No, I have no Idea what word cloud bot is either. 




 That is the fattest most worthless piece of shit excuse for a human I have ever had the displeasure of watching for a short time. And she/it has the audacity to yell at her mother about who is playing the god damned piano? I would vote yes on a bill for euthanasia on worthless gub'ment suckling Pieces of human garbage like this fat blobenly  Tuna crotched degenerate! And snake bite piercings? What does that make you hot or something? I/Us all paid for those you well fair receiving burden! And you talk about art... You are nothing close to art, you are a disgusting burden and EXACTLY what is wrong with America. Get a job you fat bitch! 




 You ruined the spaghetti! 




 Account deleted/terminated.
 




 There is always one dick shoe on the internet that sits in the shadows waiting for some poor bastard to misspell a word/name so he can pounce and a make him/herself feel like they have some sort of authority or power in their utterly meaningless (I live in my parents basement) shoddy existence. But he got a few upvotes, that's better than sex to him/her. 




 I cut them off at the ankles, I had Huge 125 lb ankles. 




 Good job guys. I was once 375 6'3" and am now 250. I know it has drastically changed your life for the better. 




 I am a "break even-er" And still mine. I own a few BTC and hash happily at 90 GH/s and still at about 6 dollars profit a day for the last 7 months. I have been in the game since 2011 and have a petty good understanding of how the price fluctuations go. This is the calm stage with the uncertainty if it will still be a viable currency. My "Gut" prediction is that it will be in the 3k-6k (US$) range in 6 months~ So I will not sell. 




 This happened a year or so after my girlfriends brother slammed his finger in the car door. His was essentially over production of calcium on the wounded spot. they took a doctors rotary rasp thingy to it and shaved it down. he got a band-aid and one stitch and they sent him on his merry way with a lollipop. No big deal brutha! 




 If you love your dog, bring him/her inside to sleep in your bed. Animals cannot tell you they are scared, but they get scared the same if not more so than we do as logical thinking individuals. Example: My cat is scared of floating balloons, She doesn't know how or why they float so it scares her (Cat Mind Fuck), we know why they float, helium is lighter than air etc... But get a picture if you see it again. Trail cam perhaps. 




 No amount of "White washing" would change the fact that everyone knows this is Neil Degrasse Tyson and he is African American and fricken awesome! Not everything has to be about race, I think its just a magazine cover, that's it. 




 Ha! 




 Newport, Oregon, [Undersea Gardens](http://www.marinersquare.com/undersea-gardens/) and an [outside view](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cd/84/b5/oregon-undersea-gardens.jpg). Cool place. 




 That's exactly what I was thinking. Across the street from Rippley's and the wax museum. I think they call it the undersea gardens or something. 




 Oh man, 350 bucks I paid for the [voodoo 3dfx 3500](http://img.tomshardware.com/us/1999/11/18/3dfx_productshot.jpg), TV tuner and video in was crazy technology! 




 Ever heard of Google? QQpayne is absolutely correct. 




 I have had A GEO Metro most of my driving life (Amongst other cars/trucks), And I will give a GEO Metro this... They may be a slow eyesore but hell, at least they're not a Prius! All gas and 40+ MPG! 




 He does it because he is a " Gooood boooooy!!" 




 Mary Magdalene for the win! 




 It looks like treats from a Spanish holiday. It's called  Da de Muertos, Celebrated for 3 days compared to our U.S. 1 day Halloween. Looks good... Who doesn't want to eat dead candy skeletons and stuff? Am I rite?
Heres a link  [-Here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead) 




 That is a shrimp I think. 




 I'm pretty sure the old cases took AT style motherboards. The new standard is ATX so that case is no good. And the power supply was probably like a 230 watt, not to mention Windows 7 takes 35 gigs (For 64 bit) 7.5g is too small, That old AGP card couldn't even run angry birds. Try finding games and software to install on "CD rom". So, New case, new mother board, new hard drive, new DVD rom drive, new graphics card, new power supply, Oh and ram, lets not forget that= New PC. Your old CRT monitor should still work. If Emachines honored all that for 99$, They most certainly would Rock! 




 Thank god I'm not the only one that does this, I thought maybe I had mental problissues. 




 Thank you sir. 




 Yeah, what CarbonGod god said! What the hell is that thing in the background? A thunder? It kinda looks like a Del-sol truck.
