Narration: Over one hundred years ago... 

Half of humanity was eaten by the titans that suddenly appeared...

 The humanity that remained created a giant wall, and lived peacefully.

Text: Anticipated by the whole world!!

Text: Live-action film green-lit!

Mikasa: The world is cruel...

Eren: If we mess up, that's the end for humanity.

Title: Attack on Titan

Text: The attack begins on August 1!

 Is this some kind of a World History set ? 









 This is why we can't have nice things. 




 I have been always pondering about the movie for a long time now. This is what I always thought about the movie : 

The country in which the movie takes place is a mixture of both the United States and Germany. Sometimes, the movie hints at Germany and sometimes at the United States. Let's start of with the main character - Sam Lowry. He is a normal guy. Who wants a normal job. He loves old music. But, Is always unable to listen due to the government poking their nose in his affairs (Stasi reference maybe ?? ). Then, there is the infamous Flying scene where Lowry is trying to save a damsel in distress. But, he is constantly being stopped by forces such as huge walls (Berlin Wall maybe ?? ). There is a scene where a bomb explodes in the restaurant but the people seem to be going on casually after it explodes showing how they have been brain-washed by the government to believe that everything is okay (Censorship and prohibition of free-speech.) 

Sam Tuttle (De Niro) represents whistle blowers and the group of resistance who always oppose the Government. He always points the common people in the right direction.

Could someone tell me if I am interpreting this the wrong way ?? How did you feel after watching the movie ?? What do you think the movie is about ?? 














 was recis ? 




 "You shee Johnny Boy, If you shaven't watched al of Chris Nolan's movies liek I did, you are a digusthting pleb. Nothing more to say now. Bugger Ohff."

  Casting of the film was difficult. Jason Robards was originally cast in the title role, but he became ill with dysentery during early filming. After leaving for treatment, he was forbidden by his doctors to return. Herzog considered casting Jack Nicholson, or playing the role of Fitzcarraldo himself, before Klaus Kinski accepted the role. Herzog had done considerable film work with Kinski. By that point, forty percent of shooting with Robards was complete. For continuity, Herzog had to begin a total reshoot with Kinski. Mick Jagger was originally cast as Fitzcarraldo's assistant Wilbur, but due to the delays, his shooting schedule expired. He departed to tour with the Rolling Stones. Herzog dropped Jagger's character from the script altogether as he reshot the film from the beginning. Brazilian actor Grande Otelo and singer Milton Nascimento play minor parts.
