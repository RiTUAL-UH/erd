 Sylar killed everyone and sneaked onto the Enterprise. Probably. 




 [This is from an Australian sketch comedy show called *Open Slather*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4582410/) 




 Glad you like it : )  
I'm still going to mess with it - still needs a larger k in there somewhere

I am not a bot due to me not being smart enough to write a bot. If this comment receives a total comment score of -1 I will post more weird taco gifs.

 wow...went full circle on that one 



















 /u/Ninjar2033 made this 














 gah that sucks  
i've used it without too many problems on both fedora and ubuntu 14.10, currently using it primarily on 14.10, if that helps at all. 




 kdenlive is kind of like premiere, I guess. I can chop stuff up easily and apply most effects (composite, transitions, speed) but it crashes if I apply too many at once. One of these days I'll have to make a miserable hifw trying to learn blender gif.  
Also, I could never get motion tracking to work in kdenlive, hence ae/ps 




 holy shib i could not figure out animstack until just now.  
[Thanks jl3 and co. Thanks so much.](http://i.imgur.com/XlMjvya.gifv)

Awesome gif 




 I've found it easier to composite in pngs of the text using a video editor and then use gimp for the final crop/touch up stuff. If you use linux kdenlive+ffmpeg+gimp can get you started. I think /u/matt01ss did some gimp tutorials a long time ago. Maybe /u/jimlast3 or /u/chemicalole can chime in on your specific question. 




 The Cable Guy

finally decided to go with a random sampling of the top HQGiffers from the past month or so (with hero, t_l_c, and e l, obv)
