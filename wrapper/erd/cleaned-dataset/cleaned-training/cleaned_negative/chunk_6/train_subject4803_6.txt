 What time was this taken at? 









 I saw the same thing happen, except it was an average guy running full speed on the treadmill. It was very early in the morning so the gym was relatively empty. He slipped, and the treadmill shot him straight back, his towel flying into his face. Dazed and confused, he looked around to see if anyone saw. I did, but he didn't realize so he tried to get back on, without realizing that the treadmill was still on full speed. He slipped again, fell on his knees and got shit backwards into the stationary bikes. Probably one of the funniest things I've seen at the gym.   




 I thought he was more like "come at me bro!" 




 Isn't this Stephen Lang?
