 Upgrade your weapons at Andre.  If you want to melee sif, try grabbing a summon to help, and stay under him and hack away.  or if you have to cheese him to move on with the game, you can jump to the ledge left of his fog gate and blast him with poison arrows.  He just sits there and takes it. 




 After killing the zombie Dragon, do a jump two hand attack on his legs and his half body will stand up (which to me is probably the coolest/weirdest thing in Dark Souls) then you can jump directly down to Pricilla!  




 Near the Avelyn? : ) 




 Across the universe // wristcutters.  Somehow was a double feature at a 1$ dollar theatre, walked out, came back, walked out
