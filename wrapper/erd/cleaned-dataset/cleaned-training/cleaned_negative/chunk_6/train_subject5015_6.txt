 I'm guessing the former. 




 Whole frontpage is still full of these posts. Looks like they're being deleted as fast as they come up.

 Elo Elo Elo.. that name rings a bell... isn't he the one known as the 'slippery man'? 




 Nice video, but why would you take out the comms, that's the best part! 

Edit: Didn't check the description, comms in original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGLtv78bleM 




 Thought as much. 




 Am I missing something or is this just a standard shitpost?

Edit: I take that back, this song is actually pretty good. 




 IRL 




 10/10 




 The expansions are free, what you're probably paying for is some useless ship skins and a few really cheap frigates. These links pretty good: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1c211z/the_have_a_tip_leave_a_tip_eve_thread_round_v_the/ 




 Personally i'd go 3 torps and a scram. Not sure if that's the correct decision, however. 




 Really? Can people still do this even though CCP owns the rights to the game? 




 Damping is basically the more reliable version of ECM. Personally I prefer ECM to dampening, purely because it's more rage inducing. You're right, things like the scorpion do tend to get primaried. I'd suggest going into the tech 2 frigates for small gang (Keres and Hyena are the most favoured) and the Recon for fleet/black ops fights (although even those tend to die fast, as they're not very tanky at all). Something to note too, techinically the Armageddon (Amarr battleship) is an EWAR ship as it gets very good bonus' to neuts. I even think BRAVE might have it as its doctrine.  




 I think it's just 4chan trolls trying to make reddit look bad. What they don't realise is that reddit probably shares a large ammount of its userbase with 4chan. 




 Use the extension hide fedora. 




 Yeah i'm more thinking of lowsec/nullsec. 




 Shit, should I have added a /sarcasm tag? I can't tell who's joking anymore, this is too meta for me. 




 You need someone to refer you. Sent you a pm with the link (posting it in comments is a big no-no.) 




 Awesome iniative. I might donate if it gets rolling. A sidenote, battleclinic has some *really* *really* bad fits sometimes. I find it useful to corroborate them with zkillboard losses, and always check the date on the fit, in case it was made a few years ago. 




 Lmao. Space drama best drama.

de*veldrin: you walk around like you're fucking high and mighty. my morning shit today had more value then you

Best line.

 




 Holy shit. If that isn't the most stunning thing i've seen all week I don't know what is. 




 Do ittt! I'll even double your isk if you come back now! :D 




 Yep. There is a warning before you accept the contract, however, saying that you might not be able to enter the station. You have to be pretty silly (or tired) to accept it. 




 Don't know *where* you wont be killed, but I know ships like the Skiff are a deterant to suicide gankers becuase they're so tanky and deal so much damage.

Also the lower the sec status (0.5 vs 1.0 for example) the longer it takes for the space police to respond and kill your attackers. Keep that in mind. 




 Imagine having a courier contract set to inside fort knox. Basically guy turns up in a fedex truck and gets told to fuck off. 1 day later courier contract fails and the scammer gets the collateral. 




 An apt description of the couirer contract scam (one of them, at least). 




 really cool video. Would probably be a lot better if voiced differently (something about the tone is off?). 




 Think I read (dont quote me on this) it was going to be around 1.1b, bit cheaper than a freighter. 




 You should watch some videos on how to fit a ship (looks like most of your ships are missing rigs, and modules) , then go on zkillboard and look for losses for some example fits.

Edit: if you'd like I can help you out with the whole fitting a ship thing, PM me. 




 How much did he get you for?

Edit: Nvm. 




 I would have given the money back. 




 Fught ev0ke a few months ago who were in HAM(?)gu's and basi's. Good number of them too. 




 I'm sorry, the anti-PL circlejerk is only okay in my eyes if it produces some quality OC. 




 Yeah I think they did. Maybe make them have 0m/s, need support machs to bump them! 




 He changed his flair, hes INK now! Magic! 




 I think if it was that easy CCP would have done it already (or they think it's just fine as it is). From my quite limited experience dealing with them, i'd say maybe you could make them go slower. Most of the problems i've had with them is actually catching the damn things. 




 Yeah, that Tech 2 sentry train is a bitch. I guess we'll only know when there's something better than them, not necessarily when they're balanced. 




 No idea, should ask someone that uses them! 




 Pretty lazerbeams. 




 Yeah i'm relatively new to the game, I don't think i'm in a position to suggest nerfs or buffs. If it was so easy that I could suggest something (or even you, having used them extensively) to 'fix' it then CCP would have done it already.

Granted too most of the bitching i've heard is either from reddit or corp mates, i've never actually flown one. I can see however why they're considered OP. 




 Not turning off formatting in pidgin 




 Good question, I don't really know the exact numbers or even the bonus', thats up to CCP to decide through tons and tons of playtesting. It's pretty well agreed, even by the people that use them, that ishtars need a proper nerf. They're the goto PvE and PvP ship right now, I know that much. 




 I'm fine with that as long as Ishtars are nerfed too. 




 https://zkillboard.com/kill/42928756/

What is this ship meant to do? 




 Good thing my railgu is almost finished. 




 It's basically real life spaceship simulator with no rules against scamming and infinite respawns. 




 A suprisingly apt description. 




 And nothing of value was lost. 




 In the end, there is only one survivor.... the one with the most ishtars. 




 CEO is also fond of SeBo'd fed navy commets... https://zkillboard.com/kill/42636105/ ... is this actually a thing? 




 Aw yeah, Widow represent. 




 I'm more interested in the people in the right corner. I wonder what their story is. 




 Then you think of some clever work around to get that function working. It's all downhill from there. 




 Someone with 10 accounts going around and downvoting everyone, rofl. 




 Well if you weren't banned before you're going to be banned now... Also is it possible you didn't warp because maybe you lagged? There's plenty of possible explanations as to why your Garmur died, and they're not all CCP's fault. It's certainly not worth getting your account(s) banned. 




 Was he in a paladin? That looks like a bastion or a siege module on the right? 




 Means he got shadowbanned. 




 I wonder if this would make people actually use them. 




 Yeah it looks fine on firefox, probably just my browser. 




 I mean you say that... but I still don't know how territory is counted. Maybe it's the app I play on that fucks it up but I doubt it. 




 Or cuts your hand off with a machete, either work. 




 Must have accidentally set a break point before the REM function. 




 Sounds like a dream vacation. 




 I'm on windows 7 64bit, I do get some other wierd text errors on some websites so it's probably on my end. Weird because it's showing up as Helvetica Neue light on my end (using whatfont). 




 Probably intentional, like the Phased Weapon Navigation Array Generation Extron, or PWNAGE. 




 http://puu.sh/dgwmq/8d1615979a.png

The text at the bottom and on the side looks really packed in, is that intentional? I'm on Chrome 40/W7 - no extensions. 




 Not just any nubbins, *hisec* nubbins. I can't tell if this is a troll post. Look at that rattle fit, then look back at the thread title. 




 Is... is he on a fucking tower? ANOTHER FUCKING TOWER? GOD DAMNIT UBISOFT WE DONT NEED TO CLIMB ANYMORE FUCKING TOWERS. 




 Here we see a perfect example of autism. 




 Recall program got cancelled. 




 Mostly used in industry, however the game interface is slightly reminding of spreadsheets, the dscan (http://evewormholecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/scannnooor.png), overview (https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5ce9kSbuijY/TWO1_vdep4I/AAAAAAAABHQ/8lVO5nuiozI/s1600/bb_overview.png) and market (http://justinandrewjohnson.com/sites/default/files/styles/fullsize/public/imagepicker/1/market_veldspar.png) to name a few. Don't let this intimidate you however, it's pretty easy to pickup in the first hours of playing. 




 I'm curious your opinion of this:http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/sep/24/slavery-exhibition-black-actors-cages-shut-down ? 




 They'd have to pay *me* to get me in there. 




 rofl 




 riiiip, do ratting carriers usually have those highs? 




 Toppest of keks. 




 What would they do to fix this? 




 shieeet, thats one blingy caracal. 




 Too bad nothing expensive died! 




 It's not directly said but it could be inferred from "You are buying/selling the character ONLY and nothing else".  




 CHECK CHECK CHECK, i'm pretty sure that word looses all meaning when you say it every two minutes.

["They're not awoxers, they're waffles, theres actual waffles in the fleet."](https://i.imgur.com/wUmTrQQ.jpg)  Quote of the day.  




 Am I missing something or does that FAQ not state that all assets stay on the character once transferred? I appriciate that he probably could give it back out of good will, but I don't see it in the rules. 




 You should take out those pictures of the GM conversation, pretty sure that's against the rules. Not sure what that GM's on about either. At least from my interpretation Rule 7 just states that you can't *list* items for sale, not that you have to return them if the owner forgets them. The FAQ pretty clearly states you lose those items afterwards. I could be missing something, however, and this is just my uninformed opinion.

Edit: I see how you could interpret that rule to mean that you're not allowed to leave any assets in the character, this does however seem to contradict that FAQ. 




 Not sure about the hat on the medic but the soldier looks really cool. 




 Launchers useful if you're going to be switching characters on the same account a lot. Don't have to enter your username/password every time. 




 Are the fittings for the ships in the cargo fucked up? https://zkillboard.com/kill/42721905/ looks like the hyena is a tengu.... 




 You forgot: Kills a 4 year old CFC vets titan by accident   




 Its fine tho, didn't you hear? It's already replaced, didn't want it anyway. 




 CFC just awoxed a blue, 4 year old CFC vet titan, i'm pretty sure you're not allowed to shit talk for the next few days. 




 Sometimes a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do. Aint noone that can stop soemone determined enough from just breaking it into dance. 




  I'm 90% sure that's Niles Crane from Frasier, just by looking at his body movements and hair. 




 I am the Mittani. 




 Here's a list of the coalitions and the alliances in them (dont believe that dude underneath me): https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2fdcpk/rough_coalition_headcount_thread/ 




 I have very limited knowledge on this, but I know there are some alliances that have people specifically to produce caps/super caps, so theres that. Even if you join a big alliance as an industrialist you'd probably be expected to be able to fly some of their doctrines, I imagine. 




 Have you considered seeing a counselor or therapist? Would most probably help. 




 I mean, you're not wrong. Part of the reason I love playing eve is because of the political drama, real or fake, and i'm sure thats the case for a lot of other eve players too. 




 Just turn yourself in and it will all go a lot easier. 




 Don't get me wrong, I love the circlejerk, but that's about 20% of my motivations, the rest is me wanting the CFC outed as the completely insane alliance they are. Again, you're right, if this dude is telling the truth (which he probably isn't) then he should just go to CCP/the police, my intentions are selfish (mostly). Also awesome username by the way! 




 You're right, he should, if he has concrete proof on that, which he probably dosen't. Getting someone to verify his identity is really a service to the community, more than anything, so that we know for 99% sure that          the titan kill was wrong, and that anyone trusted at alliance level in CFC is likely to be doxxed illegally. It would be a huge blow to the CFC. 




 Check out this, hah: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2nlncj/on_goons_and_doxxing/ 




 This means nothing unless you're willing to verify you're identity with a trusted third party, /u/ChribbaX, for example. Someone you can trust not to reveal your identity to CFC, but that we also trust not to lie to us. Otherwise, assuming you're not lying, good read and thank you for posting. 




 Cool model. 




 You're right, not like releasing evidence would stop CFC super pilots from looking over their back, wondering if they're going to get kicked for frequenting the wrong bar or misspeaking on teamspeak. 




 I don't even think they know tbh. 




 Why would you even say this if you're not willing to provide any evidence, and thus further the discussion in any meaningful way. From what I gathered at least Reddit was dropping the subject, as they do most drama within a few days. I also wonder what GSF would have had to say if they hadn't kicked him, i.e. if SMA would even be in CFC anymore. 




 Any chance of getting it without the vocals? 




 Do you think that's the majority of people? I'd imagine the majority of people on private trackers know what they're doing, maybe i'm too naive though. 




 Dude its super secret opsec that they can't reveal (even to renew the trust of CFC super pilots who can't talk perfectly 100% of the time). 




 Nah man, it would "compromise our IT services" 




 [Hmmmm......](http://replygif.net/i/1242.gif) 




 The place is actually pretty clean, nothing like that sticks out in my mind like that (oh wait, I just remembered I found a hair in my sauce once, but that dosen't really bother me). I've never gotten ill off the food (at least to my knowledge), and i've been eating it for years, which makes me wonder what the criteria are for these ratings. 




 Aaand my local chicken shop has a rating of 1. Well, it hasn't killed me yet. I'm also curious how stringent the criteria for these ratings are. 




 Ah I see, it makes sense now, cheers for the explanation.  




 Is this just a badly hidden advertisement for your characters? I don't get the joke, sorry. 




 Oh, yay, it looks less like a space turd! 




 Eve is real. 




 Look at the interviewers face too, he's shocked at how much of a fool he is. 




 Gallenite looks the best. 









 This photo was taken before 100 titans jumped through that cyno, however. (/s)
