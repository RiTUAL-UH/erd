well, i put to rather large "hills" in, similar to the ones on taviana. each color change in 20-30 meters, and everything that is white is between 0 and 30 m high. in the image it is compared tot eh size of namalsk, for reference  




 Well I was hoping to get road map and after that put in the geography 
 




 me too 




 hes a hipster 




 or you could just learn how to read russian 




 nobody cares 




 tldr 




 dayz 




 try epoch or overpoch, epoch lets you build bases, and overpoch is a combination of overwatch, which adds more guns, and epoch. (ps taviana is best map NA) 




 how about you look on the map

that might help 




 ive run in to many hackers on sa, meanwhile on the mod i have never seen one 




 right click
move mouse
click 




 when does it come out? i remember on your previous posts you said relatively soon 




 i feel like you could get rust poisoning from flippping the kara around your hand :)  




 i also like teh tiger tooth, a golden knife. i hope there are rare stripe patterns 




 yes i think so, i havent seen or heard of anyone getting a knife other than th new ones in chroma 




 are none of these on Huntsman? 









 So i have the basic outline and locations of towns/cities/airfields, i just need help with design. i need help with building placements. If you could also help with road placements, but i feel as though thats too much to ask 


here is the concept: http://i.imgur.com/7z6huty.jpg

if you can help me out at all, it would be greatly appreciated
