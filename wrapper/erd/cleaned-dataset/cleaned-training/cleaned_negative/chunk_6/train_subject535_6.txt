 Taking someone else's photo and simply blowing it up is about the pinnacle of work-stealing.
  
But that wasn't what he did. 
  
I take it you're not an artist.
  
What makes someone an artist?  




 I'm curious, what makes this art a disgrace and an embarrassment?  




 Because creating art means being original in some way.
  
How isn't what Richard Prince doing original? How many others have done this? And why is doing something original a prerequisite for it being art? Is painting a sunset or a bowl of fruit art? As neither is truly an original idea.
  
All this guy does is rip off actually creative people.
  
I would say that Prince's transformation of these photos is way more creative and interesting then the originals.  




 This work would most likely fall under transformative art and thus be protected under fair use.  




 Slightly altering and blowing up someone else's photo doesn't make you an artist.
  
Why?

[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.

The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

  
  
Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India.

  From areas that we have data, GMOs have been beneficial to developing nations.
  

[From a study which analyzed available data form the Philippines.](http://i.imgur.com/KXcsl0T.png)
  
Form their conclusion.  
  
[Using farm-level survey data from the Philippines and quantile regression techniques that control for selection problems, we find that the effect Bt corn on yields is generally more strongly felt by producers at the lower end of the yield distribution. If we subscribe to the typical belief that lower-yielding producers are mostly poor smallholders (i.e., subsistence farmers), then the results from our analysis provides some evidence that Bt corn technology has benefited poor corn farmers in the Philippines through higher relative yield effects as compared to the more commercial producers at the upper end of the yield distribution. It is likely that the proportionately higher yield effect observed for poor smallholders is made possible by the damage abating property being embedded within the Bt technology. This suggests that Bt technology does not require substantial levels of technical skills and learning for it to be an effective insect control technology (i.e., as compared to, say, some Integrated Pest Management control practices that require season-long Farmer Field School training to effectively implement).](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919213001395)  
  
  
Also the net effect of Bt-cotton has mostly been favorable to farmers in India. . . 
 
 
  
The role of genetically modified (GM) crops for food security is the subject of public controversy. GM crops could contribute to food production increases and higher food availability. There may also be impacts on food quality and nutrient composition. Finally, growing GM crops may influence farmers income and thus their economic access to food. Smallholder farmers make up a large proportion of the undernourished people worldwide. Our study focuses on this latter aspect and provides the first ex post analysis of food security impacts of GM crops at the micro level. We use comprehensive panel data collected over several years from farm households in India, where insect-resistant GM cotton has been widely adopted. Controlling for other factors, the adoption of GM cotton has significantly improved calorie consumption and dietary quality, resulting from increased family incomes. This technology has reduced food insecurity by 1520% among cotton-producing households. GM crops alone will not solve the hunger problem, but they can be an important component in a broader food security strategy.

 Bt cotton has reduced pesticide applications by 50%, with the largest reductions of 70% occurring in the most toxic types of chemicals. Results of fixed-effects Poisson models confirm that Bt has notably reduced the incidence of acute pesticide poisoning among cotton growers. These effects have become more pronounced with increasing technology adoption rates. Bt cotton now helps to avoid several million cases of pesticide poisoning in India every year, which also entails sizeable health cost savings.

We address this shortcoming by
analyzing economic impacts and impact dynamics of Bt cotton in
India. Building on unique panel data collected between 2002 and
2008, and controlling for nonrandom selection bias in technology
adoption, we show that Bt has caused a 24% increase in cotton
yield per acre through reduced pest damage and a 50% gain in
cotton pro
fi
t among smallholders. These bene
fi
ts are stable; there
are even indications that they have increased over time. We
further show that Bt cotton adoption has raised consumption
expenditures, a common measure of household living standard, by
18% during the 2006

2008 period. We conclude that Bt cotton has
created large and sustainable bene
fi
ts, which contribute to posi-
tive economic and social development in India.

Accounting for possible selection bias, we show that the Bt pesticide reducing effect has been sustainable. In spite of an increase in pesticide sprays against secondary pests, total pesticide use has decreased significantly over time. Bt has also reduced pesticide applications by non-Bt farmers. These results mitigate the concern that Bt technology would soon become obsolete in small farmer environments. The survey data on actual pesticide use in farmers fields complement previous entomological research.

  There is a broad literature on the impact of Bt cotton adoption in different countries, but few studies have explicitly looked at environmental and health effects from an economic perspective. We analyse the impact of Bt cotton on environmental efficiency in Pakistan, using farm survey data and a doubly heteroskedastic stochastic production function framework. Negative environmental and health effects of chemical pesticide use are quantified with the environmental impact quotient. Bt-adopting farms have higher cotton yields, while using lower pesticide quantities and causing less environmental damage. Bt farms are both technically and environmentally more efficient than non-Bt farms. Bt adoption increases environmental efficiency by 37%. Achieving the same reduction in negative environmental and health impact without Bt would cost conventional cotton farmers US$ 54 per acre in terms of foregone yields and revenues (7% of total revenues). Extrapolating this shadow price of the technology's health and environmental benefits to the total Bt cotton area in Pakistan results in an aggregate value of US$ 370 million. These benefits are in addition to the profit gains for Bt-adopting farmers. Our results suggest that Bt technology can contribute to sustainable agricultural development.

 You're wrong, Bowman wasn't in Food Inc. Percy Schmeiser was.
  
Though Schmeiser also wasn't sued over cross pollination. 
  
 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.
