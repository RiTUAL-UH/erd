 Looks like maybe money can't buy everything?

Although I do know it can buy you a haircut and style. 




 but why dont they call hillary a capitalist democrat? or Jeb or Walker Capitalist republicans? 




 LOVE THIS!! 




 i love drum lines! 




 they're afraid that their viewers might google socialist 









 Joined, liked and shared 




 rainbows too...oh the horror! 




 so, then are you advocating for corporate welfare?  Because if they don't pay their workers enough, the taxpayer is on the hook for it 




 There is help for people who are seriously impaired to pay their bills...its why we have social security disability 




 Pass the popcorn please! 




 me too 




 excellent point 




 Yes, this is about a fairer distribution of wealth 




 but only if you're straight /s 




 If a company cannot afford to pay a livable wage, that company is not viable and should close its doors.  Raising wages allows more people to have money to spend into the economy, increasing demand, and therefore creating jobs 




 ummm...good luck with that 









 I don't think any worker is worth less than a living wage...if I want to hire someone for a job and can't find someone to do it for $8 hour I can pay better or do it myself 




 well Roe v Wade was over 40 years ago, and they're still fighting that one...
