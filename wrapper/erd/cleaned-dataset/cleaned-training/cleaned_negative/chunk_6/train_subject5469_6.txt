 It's a new defense called *The Firing Squad* defense. 

If you have 13 people shooting at someone - make sure the other 12 get off on lesser charges (or no charges) and throw the book at the 13th (to calm the mob). 

Then when the 13th person goes to trial the prosecutor can shrug and say 'We don't know beyond reasonable doubt if *this* guys bullet is the one that killed the victim".

So make sure if you ever go to commit murder to bring at least 12 friends along. Apparently in America it's a "Get out of Jail Free' card now, seeing as it is enshrined in precedence.  




 I stated:

 If you think that running from the police should automatically mean a public execution, on the spot, maybe you are in the wrong country.

The Bill of Rights, state laws and the oaths that police officers take do not hinge on personal opinion.  




 New York City alone has belched up half a billion dollars since 2009, to settle [police brutality civil suits out of court.](http://www.thenation.com/blog/204425/police-story-unravels-how-did-nypd-break-nba-players-leg?_ga=1.150872820.338813853.1432479337)


I bet if that money were coming out of FOP retirement funds, things would change in a hot minute. 




 If the job is too mentally stressful for them to abide by the Oath that they took upon getting the job, then it's time to quit and get some mental health care.  




  Look at the comments. Submit or die.

And you are just going to accept 'submit or die' as the way things are in the US now? Why don't all of these 'commenters' just go have a good old fashioned Constitution burning party? Then they can lay down in the street and show everyone their big, fat yellow bellies. 




 I don't know what they were thinking before they were turned into target practice. I have never been black. 

They didn't have any drugs or weapons in the car and they weren't wanted, so logic tells me that they were in fear for their lives.

If you think that running from the police should automatically mean a public execution, on the spot, maybe you are in the wrong country.

 




 Thanks. I'm too old to bother about being yelled at on reddit. I just want young people to wake up to a few things, or they are going to have a really bad time. 




 Never heard of 'roid rage'? Seriously. 

Of growing concern to physicians and psychologists is the mounting evidence that anabolic /androgenic steroids cause severe and sometimes permanent mental disorders. The addictive nature of steroids often leads users to administer progressively higher doses and more exotic combinations of the drugs to maintain and increase the initial muscle building effects.

***Abundant clinical and anecdotal evidence suggests that steroids often lead to unusually aggressive and irrational behavior.***

And using steroids isn't a problem for a guy who straps on a gun every day and goes out to deal with the public?

Just using a little common sense here.

 Wondering where all this water is coming from? 

Short vid from a 2012 Rutgers study: https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU 









 The Jet Stream has shifted - finally. Have you seen this? 

https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU

It is the very best explanation of 'weather weirding' that we have seen lately.

I first found her study when i noticed the Jet Stream doing very anomalous things in 2013. 









 I think that is why this web group is collating officer involved civilian deaths by collecting media stories. Right now that is the only way to get a real number.  




 When the car backfired, the plainclothes reported that it was a gunshot. That brought in the Rambos. 




 The really sickening thing about this case is this. I have relatives in medicine- one is a coroner. He has autopsied 2 'hero' police officers killed in the line of duty. Both of them had cocaine in their systems. One exhibited long term steroid use. 




 You forgot a 0.

By the narrowest measure possible  in which we give police every benefit of the cause of death doubt in incidents where they Tasered or restrained suspects  85 percent of the sampled incidents were the sort of police killings the government might be expected to keep track of. If we include other arrest-related deaths (and theyre included in Bureau of Justice figures), then 93 percent of incidents qualified as police killings.

Applying these percentages to the total count at Killed By Police would imply that officers acting in the line of duty have killed in the neighborhood of 1,250 to 1,350 people since May 1, 2013. Thats about 1,000 deaths per year.

http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/another-much-higher-count-of-police-homicides/ 




 113?

 It is *exactly* like saying "it's ok". It sets court precedent that automatically justifies future shootings, chokings, beatings, etc by the police.  




 One thing that everyone seems to overlook here. Every single one of these cases in which a cop is found not guilty of killing a civilian stacks the deck on precedence in a court of law. 

If this keeps up, police will be able to show justification in any court of law for killing anyone for any reason- due to precedence of prior case law. 

And it won't matter what color you are. 




 I have one issue with the mannequin element. There were 5 shots to the womans head that was not on the mannequin for some reason. 




 officer reported that was not the case and at 10:47 p.m. radioed: Passenger just put his hands out asking us to stop. He does not have a gun. He has black gloves on, the officer said, according to the transcript.

Theres a red pop can in his hand.

 It was a plainclothes cop in an unmarked vehicle attempting to pull them over for not using a turn signal. That's what started them running. 

If some stranger in street clothes tried to get you to pull over, would you?

 Pine nuts are the little seeds between the 'shells' on the pine cone. Take a fully dried but fresh pine cone (like just off the tree for a week or two) and hit it hard on something- they fly out. Pine nuts sell for about 12-15 bucks a lb around here.

Washoe   Paiute Indians [make pastes and flour out of it](http://travelnevada.com/sites/default/files/styles/rotator_detail/public/field/image/PineNuts_Paiute.jpg?itok=py4U05Og) and you can eat them raw like regular nuts. Delicious and very good for you. 




 On a related note, my kitten can't hunt.

 This is why old people look like hell. All the hugs. 




 Obviously the point of the matter isn't the deed, but the *justice* or *injustice* of the deed combined with viewers personal immersion with the character.

You are trying to shift the point of the matter to fit some pre-defined political stance.

People *did* go out of their minds at the Red Wedding - because of perceived injustice toward innocent people. 

People *didn't* go out of their minds with the golden crown scene, because the brother was a violent, stupid dick who sold his little sister to barbarians.

People *did* go out of their minds when Ned was beheaded, because it was unjust. 

People *didn't* go out of their minds when Ramsey (justly, give or take) tortured Theon, because Theon killed or had killed hundreds of innocent people who were nearly family, including 2 little boys.

Sansa? It wouldn't matter if she were raped or had her hand cut off or was flayed or poked in the eye with a pin. 

It wasn't the *details* of the act that mattered. It was the *unjust* violence against this wholly innocent girl who has been with viewers since the beginning- and who has already been through total hell. 

Capiche? 




 Of course we didn't. Point being that nature has managed to generate an exquisitely balanced series of symbiotic relationships within biological and geographical systems that functioned pretty damn well before humans came along. And will continue to do so long after we are gone- if we don't succeed in utterly wiping it out.

To imagine that nature 'needs' us to keep things straightened out is the height of arrogance. 




 Santa Barbara did a study on coyotes killed because they had become urbanized  - autopsies to check their dietary habits. Out of 200 coyotes they found that 80% of their diet was rodents. Rats, wild rabbits, mice and shrews. The rest was mainly garbage. No cats. No dogs. 




  Coyotes only expanded to most of the United States relatively recently, and as a result of us killing off wolves. 

You just made my point. You kill off an apex predator- another will come along and fill its place. "Nature balancing itself out." And the prey animals, rodents to deer, will overpopulate until that occurs. 
 




 Ok I'll make this clearer.

Bob kills 100 people, including 2 little kids. He gets the death penalty. 

Everyone shrugs.

An innocent, 15 year old girl does nothing wrong. She gets the death penalty.

Everyone raises hell.

Obviously the point of the matter isn't the *death penalty*, but the *injustice*.

 Sansa is a naive child who has been pretty much harmless her whole life. She lost her entire family in horrible ways and has been used as a pawn for 3 years.

The man Ramsey mutilated and tortured killed most of the people of Winterfell, men, women and children that he grew up with, including his teacher and weapons master - then had two innocent children killed and bodies burned to hang on the wall - in front of people who loved them (they didn't know they were farmers boys)

So of course peoples sympathies are with Sansa. Peoples sympathies are always with the innocent. Has nothing to do with sex.

 That's an important point. People got to know each other. You couldn't server hop, no blended servers. To ninja or act like an asshole back in the old days would get you shunned. 




 I lived in a hay growing area in NV. One year the good ole boys had a 3 day coyote hunt. For 3 years afterwards they lost tons of hay to Jackrabbits.

Coyotes are native to every state in the US. Best to leave shit the hell alone. It will balance itself out. That's what nature does.  




 I saw what someone else posted to the wow forum and it was right on. http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17346427864

 I would flawlessly recreate the Vanilla servers. The only elements of new content I would add is reforging and transmogging. Besides these, this game would follow the original game, right through WotLK. No LFR or LFD. No player/server phasing. Recreating the sense of community is a goal here.
 
 Other content that was hinted at, but not followed through with, would be added; like the Emerald Dream. This would extend the time frame of events and add new content within the old framework. 
 
 It would be available to all players for a one time fee of $10, same for returning players. And I can guarantee there will be returning players, millions of them. So many would come just to see the Emerald Dream fulfilled.
 
 Upon log-in players would have the normal choices of servers and characters- but with an added choice upon making a new character- in Vanilla. This would be the fork in the road that players who paid the $10 fee could choose.
 
 This would not eliminate the new game, it would still be available for ez mode players. 

This would make me so goddam happy. 




 I saw this yesterday and posted it to reddit.  I would immediately drop $10 make a new toon on this and never look back.

 Blackrock chain running- actually sparked my fear of heights. I would hold my breath all the way.

I just realized how badly lfr/lfg impacts immersion.  




 These weren't created when we started. It was full on guild run to the dungeon. Damn those were fun times- killing shit along the way. 




 I noticed [this chart of subscriber stats](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/) just yesterday and noticed that the downward turn started in '10. Right about the time lfr/lfg started.
I wondered about a connection, seeing as lfr lfg had such a huge impact on player experience. 




 I loved ST. Hate what they did to it.  




 Traveling to get to the dungeon was the first half of the adventure.  




 But they were pretty much color coded shortly after release. 




 Is there such a thing as power leveling any more? You can sleepwalk through it and it happens so fast you barely see half of the world.

 Funny story about LBJ.

A very good friend of my mothers was the (young, pretty) widow of a gentlemen who had been in French politics. She and her dead husbands brother were invited to a dinner party at a major hotel after a diplomatic meeting in France and LBJ and his retinue was there. Things got drunkenly boisterous and flirtatious as the evening went on and she eventually retired to her suite.

An hour later she answered a knock at her door and there stood LBJ, in a silk bathrobe with a bottle of champagne, a bouquet of flowers and a huge cigar- with two secret service men flanking him.

He said "Madame, your President has come to pay you a call."

And she let him in.

When he left in the wee hours the secret service men were still standing there outside of the room.

She said he "was not pretty, but he was very persuasive". 




 Early 40's through late 70's. They raised 4 children. They bought one home and then they had a large home built in the mid '50s on 10 acres. They took two week (or longer) vacations every year. They could have been the poster children for "The American Dream"

It had a strong union. I remember my grandfather going out the door to a strike with a lead-filled baseball bat. And he was white collar system designer.

My grandfather had briefly played for the Pittsburgh Steelers (back injury) and my grandmother was a Rosie the Riveter who got her degree between having babies.

They retired before NAFTA - after which the plant moved manufacturing overseas. 




 "**The question is whether it would make them fear for their safety, or the safety of those around them..**

[A criminal threat,](http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/criminal-threats.htm) sometimes known as the terrorist threat, malicious harassment, or by other terms, occurs when someone threatens to kill or physically harm someone else.
 




 
Sure people need electricians, etc. But who is going to design the systems in the first place? 




 The only reason we won WW2 was because of our massive and innovative manufacturing base. We needed a large number of educated people to design, innovate and create for those manufacturers. 

Now we cannot even make umbrellas. 

WW3 is not going to be won by ranks of baristas and we cannot maintain superpower status with herds of burger flippers.

The US produced large quantities of military equipment into late 1945, including nuclear weapons, and became one of the strongest, most technically advanced military forces in the world. In addition to out-producing the Axis, the Allies produced technological innovations including radar (instrumental in winning the Battle of Britain), sonar (improving their ability to sink U-boats), the atomic bomb (eliminated the need to invade Japan) and the proximity fuze. Five times as effective as contact or timed fuzes, the latter was devastating in naval use against Japanese aircraft and so effective against German ground troops that General George S. Patton said it "won the Battle of the Bulge for us."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_production_during_World_War_II 




 My grandparents worked for a major appliance manufacturer here in the states. They both had degrees and would not have had their positions without them. 

It's not that we have too many people with college degrees, we no longer have an innovative, massive manufacturing base to support them. This is what needs to change. 




 I know someone who works for them- this melt is exactly what they have been waiting and planning for so they can move in to drill.

 How about the best Pranks Blizzard ever played?
 
Corrupted Blood Plague (actually a glitch- but funnier than hell, regardless). https://youtu.be/RxDvxKeLWlA 
We would actually go fight Hakkar just to port hunters back to main cities to spread this. 

DK Plague:
https://youtu.be/7DUzJklzJ0Y?t=13s

And the Zombie Plague (actually part of the scourge invasion):
https://youtu.be/zdT3Tert6DQ 




 Under a 14 yr old boys bed. 




 One of the main ones was kiting dragons and mini bosses to main cities. 

Blizzard ended up tethering them. But the fun and excitement of doing it- or other people doing it and the spontaneous mini raids that would form to kill it were part of the excitement of 'whats going to happen today?' when you logged on. 

The last one I was able to kite was Shan Bu to the Emperors Step. Someone forgot to tether him or they thought it couldn't be done. He stayed there through the weekend until re-set. 

Album: http://imgur.com/a/4vqEV

The other prank, also removed, was snowballs. 

[This was hysterically funny.](http://i.imgur.com/eA2QeC0.jpg)

When they first made snowballs in the game the victim would flip over onto it's back. Everyone loved them. 

Also, as I discovered when my friends and I went to have a snowball fight on the SW/IF Tram, snowballs travelled at exactly the same speed as the tram. So the result was that once they got off the tram they would be hit by every snowball thrown at them during the ride. 

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM - the target would be doing flips in the air, totally stun-locked.

So we would lurk around the station, wait till some poor, unsuspecting player got on, get on the last tram car and start pelting snowballs at them. I'm laughing right now thinking about it. They would fly through the air- same speed as the tram - and all catch up once the victim got off the tram.

Also we discovered that if you threw a snowball at a target at the *moment* they mounted a taxi bird, the snowballs would hit them as soon as they landed - anywhere. Took exquisite timing. Best was when you and a friend were going to taxi somewhere- let them mount while you pelt them. The cursing in pm when they landed .. freaking hilarious. 

And blizzard stopped it.. such a bummer. 




 Holy shit you don't know what you are talking about.

'talking about'? I am looking at a graph that is basically in a constant state of plummet, besides a few bumps, since end of WotLK. 




 Interesting, LFR and LFD were rolled out between 2009 (lfd) and 2011 (lfr) - about the time that blizz had 11-12 million subscribers. 

By Q2, 2012 they had dropped to 9 million subscribers. So that's pretty damn interesting. The only times it has come up above that number is briefly during expac releases before going down again.

Hell, maybe it did kill the game.
 




 So basically it is losing a million subscribers a month. Unless they do something drastically imaginative, the game is dead by fall. 




  the biggest rise of subscribers ever?

Do you have a link for this? I don't know of any 'rise'.  If it were different, you would not have stated this:

normal servers are already struggling.

I know of a lot of players who came back, hopeful, then left again.

Here's the numbers: https://youtu.be/8dOsT8x6iy8
 




 From your post of 6 days ago:

Yeah, but Lich King dropped a weapon for every spec and class. Therefore, all players had access to slightly higher item level weapons and no specific classes were left out. Same with Spine/Madness in Dragon Soul - between the two bosses, all classes had access to a weapon/trinket of the same ilevel to their peers. 




 Normal servers are struggling to maintain a player base after losing millions of players due to WoD. This could refresh that player base. 

If you didn't like Vanilla, that's fine. You don't need to play it. A lot of people did and still do love it. I know a lot of old school players- all but two of us are on WotLK servers. As one of them put it "If Blizzard won't do it, someone will (and has)."

ps How did you get from Vanilla to WoD unless you played it through? If so- it obviously wasn't 'bad'. If you never played it- how would you know? 




 Thank god people blinded by nostalgia can't decide what Blizzard does or doesnt do.

If you enjoy WoD, how would this impact your game? 

I think the post is brilliant. It takes nothing away from the current game, while giving a lot of people what they want. You have a personal problem with that?

I have watched players unsub for months now and know more old player friends who are now on WotLK rogue servers than in the official game.  









 I like how you put that; 'chupacabra'. 

It was while studying the Jarrell that I first discovered Gravity Waves in relation to amping up storms. I have a fascination with resonant waves and effects so it is very interesting.

I had heard of Jarrell, but had not really studied it until during the 2011 outbreak one of the tornados took a 'backward' track and I went into research mode. I cannot recall which tornado that was now. 

Thank you for your info. I did not know the other tornados you mentioned were also linked to gravity waves. 




 Except for the Republican crabs, who all sit around and chant 'DOWN WITH SOCIALISM!' as they slowly strangulate. 




 Unbelievable that we have gotten to the point of nearly killing off our prime pollinator. Sometimes I feel like I have stepped into a different dimension. A bad one.  




 In Ohio my mother was married to a top end blacksmith. He did ortho horse shoeing with a veterinarian. He had an aussie named Sassy and Sassy would sit on a stool in front of the horses, literally calming them to the point that they looked hypnotized. 

 This was good because he would have to work on them for longer than standard shoeing would take. 

Very smart dogs. 




 ..potential to be really, really bad had there been any sort of population center in the way.

Like Philadelphia, MS.

 Thank you for this information. I will look into this event, it seems extraordinary. 

I have had a serious love/hate relationship with tornados since 1974. I was 14 and lived just outside of Xenia. 

I had just asked on /r/stormchaser if you were *the* stormstalker of the blog. I am so glad you are. I am a big fan of your blog. It's extremely well written. If you ever have any questions about Xenia,  I'm available. I remember it very well and possibly remember a few things that haven't been written about. Like the 're-planted tree' in a neighbors field.

 Possibly more like the Mussolini style of Fascism. Where certain corporations ruled the government- and quietly kept competitors subdued.

 schooling
skooliNG/
noun
education or training received, especially at school.
"his parents paid for his schooling"
synonyms: education, teaching, tuition, instruction, tutoring, tutelage; 

In the late 18th century, Thomas Paine was amongst the earliest proponents of universal, free public education, which was considered to be a radical idea at the time.

Apparently, for some who want us to go back to those days of uneducated masses and slavery, it's still a radical idea.  




 Of course you know that a tornado can double back when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core. In this case I believe it had to do with the massive gravity wave to the south east -that generated a strong pocket of localized shear as well. 

If I seem wrong on any of this, please correct me. I am always learning. 




 That's another option- trees or bushes ripped out of the ground, leaving holes. Pretty brilliant actually.  




 Report to whom? The priest was a priest for a corrupt police dept.  




 Yes, I suppose we don't need all of this silly edumacation, seeing as it has done nothing for U.S. advancement in the world. Yep.

  They deserve the "college experience" right?

Actually our country deserves to have the brightest kids with the best education moving out into business creation and the workforce. Our former high levels of affordable education is what grew this country in the first place. As it fails- so does the country.

 




 Yes, apparently it was at 2mph when it hit Double Creek. I was thinking that possibly those divots were from surface removal - apparently they also had to remove top layers for recovery purposes in some areas. The clearly circular patterns, though, seem odd for this.

Also, the [gravity wave effect study](http://homepages.vvm.com/%7Ecurtis/Jarrell/Jarrell.htm) is fascinating in regards to 'backward motion' and the low shear, high CAPE of that day. I had just posted a story on /r/StormComing on this http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/36azjw/the_incredible_jarrell_tx_tornado_probably_one_of/

  




 That's a possibility. I am going to scan more aerial tornado damage images to see if I can find anything similar.  




  no one (read: employers) in America will recognize your school.

And why would anyone want to go back to work in America?

Germany: The law requires a minimum of 20 paid days of vacation annually, but some companies give much more than that, sometimes as much as 30 paid days.

Paid sick leave is six weeks, during which you will continue to receive your full salary. After that time, health insurance pays 70% of your last salary until you either return to work or have to retire because of your health.

Mothers are allowed six weeks leave at full pay prior to the childs birth and eight weeks at full pay afterward. The mother or father is then allowed up to three years of unpaid leave to stay at home with the child.  




 We adopted 2 young sister cats - both preggers. They gave birth within 6 hours of each other. We had set up a long clothes closet for them to do this and have privacy- one cat at each end. Within a day one of the cats had moved to the other end with the sister and sisters kittens. 11 total. Thereafter it was just one big nursing cat/kitten pile. I don't even think they knew whose was whose after a while. 




 Thanks. I was thinking the same- about the spacing and regularity. They just look very odd. 




 I know 4 'top tier' Americans currently studying abroad, and one more getting ready to go to Germany.. Americans studying abroad has become, once more, the thing. Mostly because of the high cost of native universities.

And once there - a lot of them decide they want to stay. One of my friends ended up with the Berlin Orchestra and married. Another is currently at Oxford, teaching.

Do you happen to have statistics of what you claimed? Europeans coming to American Universities in droves? And students from third world countries do not count. They are escaping a bad situation as much as anything. 




 I have noticed in several ground 'after' pictures of the Jarrell TX May 27 - 1997 there are these odd round circles on the ground. I am familiar with cycloidal arcing, drag marks, etc. but don't recall seeing these before in tornado damage images until Jarrell. 

https://extremeplanet.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/jt-dc-1.png

Is it possible, since Jarrell was a multi-vortex, that these are touchdown 'suction' marks from small vortices within the larger body? They seem very tightly clustered. I just can't figure out what else they could be. 




 Ok if american tax payers are so fucking tight fisted- the smart kids will go to other countries and they will benefit.

 Better than watching them go to other countries that will educate them for free.

 The class capable of chipping in is a ten ton elephant at this point - and since it is the 'job creating' class it will benefit the most.  




 You know what? Fuck Chase Bank   Wells Fargo, fuck the brain drain they have created, fuck high college tuition rates. 

"...the German government fully funds the education of its citizens -- and even of foreigners."

"..Finland charges no tuition fees, and it offers a large number of university programs in English.

"French University programs charge only a small tuition fee of about 200 dollars for most programs (covers everything but off campus living situations).

"Norwegian universities do not charge tuition fees for international students. 

So fuck the banks and any kind of possible excuse you can come up with for them.  




 College finance loans were originally designed to be non-crippling- at 1-2% interest when I was in college.  




 Thank god maybe we can start catching up with the rest of the civilized world. 




 The Jarrell Tornado has also been called the Dead Man Walking tornado from [this image.](http://lssn.us/image/JARREL~1.png)

By the time it passed through Jarrell, Tx. it had cleanly removed yards of asphalt from the road. Fragments of human victims were mixed with bits of formerly living livestock. Human chains of recovery personnel slowly moved across the landscape, combing through mud and debris for every trace of remains that could be retrieved for identification and burial.

The Jarrell tornado had another unique identifier, [it actually reversed course at one time- moving 'backward'.](http://homepages.vvm.com/~curtis/Jarrell/Jarrell.htm) 

In my years of experience in studying storms the Jarrell tornado is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, of tornados spawned in the United States.

 That's a very crafty bird right there. 




 Don't get too relieved. We had laying hens and I had a few that I raised from the egg. When I would come out and sit on the porch they would come running up and compete for lap room, just like small dogs. One would lay her head up on my chest for a cuddle. No food involved. Just feathery cuddles and low cooing noises. 




 Did that with my Warcraft account 10 yrs ago. 

So this year they sent an ugly Orc statue to some poor asshole at a pizza place in downtown Detroit.

 Maybe they were just waiting till Affirmative Action laws were overturned. Save on reprinting. 




 I knew Lisa Levys family (She was one of Ted Bundy's victims at the Florida sorority house). Her father was of no certain religion, but very spiritual in nature. He wrote letters asking for life instead of the death penalty for Bundy.  




 ... and bought a dozen donuts and a gallon of milk.  




 She blew him.. but he didn't give her the Coup de Nom? Even if she knew the phone was ringing...  




 Of course .. there would have been a *Juicy Couture* sign under it if it were for the prepubescent set. 




 And just how many porn sites do you cruise in a day? 

..and 'letting'? Is your wife/girlfriend like..12? 




 Actually laughed out loud
 









  This time, though, Maskell didn't bring Wehner home. He navigated his car past the Catholic hospital and industrial buildings that surrounded Keoughs campus and drove toward the outskirts of the city. Eventually, he stopped at a garbage dump, far from any homes or businesses. Maskell stepped out of the car, and the blonde, freckled teenager followed him across a vast expanse of dirt toward a dark green dumpster.
 
 It was then that she saw the body crumpled on the ground.

 Socialism as in collective buying in order to streamline, save money and improve efficiency. Unlike the American Consumer model where everyone is expected to buy their own 'thing'.

Wealthy people and corporations practice this type of socialism on a daily basis. If you ever spent time in a wealthy neighborhood you will soon see that none of them own a lawnmower. They all use mower services. And most corporations have a fleet of cars that are used by mid-level management on up. 

It's only the lower classes who are discouraged from this by accusations of 'socialism'.  




 Another part that they missed- the part after they are 'raptured'.

The Apostles ask Jesus where they will all go and he answers:

 Where, Lord?" they asked Him. He said to them, "Where the corpse is, there also the vultures will be gathered." 

Luke 17:37 




 We should have left Saddam and his wood chipper the hell alone. 









 Thing is, Saddam was a Secularist and a lot of the folks that were in his 'torture prisons' were hard core islamists who wanted Iraq to toe the line with the rest of the Islamic fundamentalist nations. Some of the IS that were captured had spent time there. 




 in 25-50 years, they'll just say "Who could have known? The science wasn't in."

People are already [on to that one:](http://i.imgur.com/xNc31Or.jpg) 




 If you think about it- if the GOP got every single wish fulfilled - the US would resemble Bangladesh in a few years. 




 The U.S. Military is one of the most 'socialist' organizations on earth. No one seems to notice that part though. 




 Somehow they missed the last chapters:

The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. **The time has come** for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small-- and **for destroying those who destroy the earth."**

Rev. 11:18 




 She looks incredible. T'would take a brave man to climb that tree. 




 Damn. Glad I only got sheep. 




 My gynecologist, when I passed one and took it in to him. If I hadn't used a pad that night because of a particularly heavy, late period I would never have known. 




 Feminists? Probably over 80% of the really nasty posters were men jumping on a bandwagon. I'm a feminist. That makes no sense at all. 




 You came in 'making claims'. So according to the rules, you first. I'll drop back in after I go have some wine and kill some orcs.  




 And they are dealing with this along with the Meningitis outbreak. . man, what a mess. 




 It got cold as hell in the mountains today and started spitting snow.. brrr! 




 Thank you. I have had a habit of growing my annuals from seed for a long time. Much more fun that way. 




 Hey! I was right in the framing of that statement. You had me second guessing myself for a minute there. 

[Prey Animals](http://digital-desert.com/wildlife/prey.html)

The term prey refers to an animal that is sought, captured, and eaten by a predator. A predator is an animal that hunts and kills other animals for food in an act called predation. Smaller predators, such as mice and lizards can be, and often are, prey for larger predators. 




 High school debate?

...it says with big, innocent eyes. 

Give it up dude. Basic statistics already wrap all the things you tried to state into a big bullshit burrito and flush it into a cesspool of hyperbole.  




 High School level debate team? Declarative statements based on fallacy and framed as questions are very overused, boring and blatant. Find a new trick.  




 I detest the ultra conservative republican party- and I detest Fabian Socialists. Hilary is a Fabian. Just praying for a Bernie win. Or we are pretty much fucked.

 Prey animals i.e.: predators prey on them. But maybe I got the .. nm. fml 




 Take it from a one time endurance rider: it's done all of the time, regularly, over rough terrain. Horses are prey animals who have developed great night vision.

 This is why I really do wish for a God to deal with assholes after death.. cause they sure don't seem to be dealt with here on earth. 




  I was wondering what was so NSFW about a tornado. Brazil just had one last week. 




 There are.. in Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands, UK etc.

Just not in the [U.S.](http://consumer.healthday.com/senior-citizen-information-31/senior-citizen-news-778/u-s-seniors-health-poorest-global-survey-shows-693917.html?lexp=true utm_expid=38353063-4.pIV1hUrQR8K_MJ1_OqjLag.1 utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) 

 




 I got hooked on trains when I had to go to Chicago from San Fran. I had the time and something about it just seemed appealing. I figured if I didn't like it I would get off in a major city and hop a plane. 

I got a cute little sleeper (came with three great meals a day) and I loved every second of it. It was like a mini vacation and was almost the same price as flying. That decided me. 




 I had a friend who lived near a private area used as a shooting/training range for the Michigan Militia.

If they started shooting before 6 am he used to aim his speakers out the upstairs window and blast the Barney Song. 




 I live in a resort area and have to go to san fran regularly. I used to drive it- utter nightmare. Now I take a nice bus to the train, have breakfast on the train, catch up on emails, Skype, prep for meetings. Get off refreshed and ready to go. It's wonderful; and cheaper than supporting a car. 




  Mussolini, who is credited with creating fascism, often said that fascist governments should be "corporatist" regimes, essentially ones that were run entirely by companies and the elites of society.

Fred Koch, father of the Koch Bros helped Mussolini develop this style of Fascism. Then came back to the US to spread it here via the John Birch Society and, apparently, his sons.  




 My idea of [glorious miles](http://www.iamtonyang.com/1208/concord_coach_bus_interior.jpg). Let someone else drive while [I kick](http://johnnyjet.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BobRavitzFloridaCarTrain20085.jpg) back, drink coffee ([or have a drink](http://images57.fotki.com/v1418/photos/2/211932/13400374/AMTRAKSPACIFICPARLOURCAR2-vi.jpg)), do emails, listen to music and watch movies. 

Got rid of my last car a few years ago and have saved around 6k a year ever since. Haven't regretted one moment.  









 This is not good.

 According to Ibach, the farm has been quarantined and the birds on the property will be killed. NDA will work with Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality to ensure proper disposal of dead birds. The likely method is burial at the site of the infection.
 
 In addition, facilities within about 6 miles will be quarantined and those within about 12 miles monitored. 





























 The National Weather Service says a 9-inch rainfall over a three-hour period may happen only once every 500 years; meteorologist Melissa Huffman said Clear Lake received 11 inches over three hours Tuesday evening.
