 Disable the Verizon software.  It's just there to snoop on you. 




 That they're blessed by CM rather than being produced by individual maintainers now (though generally the same folks are doing much of the active coding work).  First official builds were on the 5th of Jan. 




 What sort of issues?  Wired or wireless, with or without mic?

 You're still running the old unofficial build?  That's waaay out of date.  Head here and grab the official latest nightly (pro tip: clean flash the first official one you flash; after that, dirty flash is OK)

 I've never encountered Mr Oakley before but I have to say, he's fucking adorable. 




 Poison, poison, tasty fish! 




 That depends on where they work. 




 Yes way. :D

"One thing you won't find on the Aquos Crystal is an earpiece. For phone calls, the entire screen vibrates to produce sound. Sharp calls it a "Direct Wave Receiver," but to us it seems exactly like the bone conduction speaker technology we've seen pop up in Google Glass and a few other out-there devices. Just press it up against your head and you'll hear sound. Like a bone conduction speaker, the sound gets louder when you plug your ears, or if you press the Aquos against a pair of headphones, the sound will go right through them."

 I didn't say you did, was pointing this out for the benefit of the OP and other less knowledgeable folks.

It was changed because they're become more mainstream and don't want users getting into trouble having root enabled by default.  It just means those of us who have a clue have to do more work now. 




 Tapping the build number seven times is not unique to CM.  It's Android.  Though on CM it's where the root enable setting is now hidden. 




 This is called parking lights FYI.  In some places driving like that is illegal.  Just something to be aware of. 




 It's not a conspiracy, nor is it a theory.  It's a fact of how Facebook operates.  There is a ton of information online about how their algorithms work.  It's hardly a secret.  It kills your credibility to doubt they do it when it's full acknowledged by Facebook themselves.

I'm perfectly happy for folks who want to put themselves out there but I don't feel like putting up with ads and having my likeness used to convince my friends and family to buy things.

 I'll add, Facebook is turning the internet into a curated experience much like AOL back in the early 90s when it controlled a large portion of the experience; back then the internet was still a new thing for most consumers.  It's damaging how one entity has so much control over what people see. 




 Because I don't use Facebook; I don't have an account.  That's all.  Not a big deal...  you can make a forum thread as organized or disorganized as you want.  Facebook gets organized however Facebook wants to organize it to ensure they get paid. 




 Funnily enough the side mirrors are probably the most functional mod on this vehicle.  APR baby!

 No, some of us jusr appreciate the ability of a vehicle to actually drive down the road and go around corners, that's all.  Not scrape hard parts because they hit an ant. 




 There's a plastidipped metallic purple one in Southern Maryland I've seen a few times. 




 No worries, I was just curious ;) 




 Do you plan to make a version of this build log that isn't dependent on suckbook, out of curiosity?  Say on ft86club?  I'd like to follow along... 




 As a motorcyclist and FR-S owner I just have to ask - what is considered a tank slapper in a car?  I've never encountered that language in reference to a four wheeled vehicle before. 




 If you live somewhere a visual inspection is required (varies by county) then you better have a stock header and stock catted front pipe.  And yes, they do provide pictures to inspection stations of stock vehicles.  Source: lived in CA for 28 years.?

EDIT - You also can't change your intake FYI 




 Two other ppl on XDA reported this but we don't seem to have a common denominator yet. 




 When I was a kid I had a tape recorder (the one in the link) that I would run around with playing Wham (Make It Big, duh) and singing along.  Ah, the joys of a free spirit unfettered by social moires.

 Yes.  Probably somewhere during 19 or 20 is when it ended.  And now I'm a well adjusted (lol) 34.5 year old.  Family and other folks passing away, last year of HS was a rollercoaster, and I too was dealing with being bi (tho at that time I was convinced I was gay). 




 Good on ya.  I deleted mine a few months ago. 




 You wrote March. 




 FYI US IRS will not start processing 2014 returns until January 20th 2015 




 Uh, try April 15th or the next business day thereafter, in the US, dude. 




 Oh cock. 




 You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means. 




 One of my coworkers called him Mister Who...I about died. 




 Didn't mean to imply a gender connection with this feature outside of my family specifically. :) 




 To some people a car is a means of getting from Point A to Point B.  For others, it is an expression of who they are (for better or worse).

All *I'll* ever need in a car?  No. 




 The story of a former high school football star on an around the world yachting journey.  Told as single sentences randomly uttered throughout a movie about a community college... 




 The coming of age story of Chris Hansen.   




 You have to know about 127.0.0.1 to know about "Hey". 




 Like, literally? 




 $3200 of insurance and three years of increased rates because I "lost control of my vehicle" but yeah physically I was fine.  Full gear saved my ass. 




 06 January 2009, black ice on a motorcycle.  Honestly, I didn't even have a chance to go "Oh, shit!" 




 FFDP - House of the Rising Sun 




 All the men in my family have this, including me. 




 I lost 82 pounds over 2008-2009 and let me tell you...That muscle your doc told you about in your buttocks, I'm still missing it.  It really only bothers me flying, so I took two of those stadium seat cushions and made a seat with a gap at the back so the seat puts no pressure there on my tailbone. 




 Good lord, 5 and 6 kids.  Where do these people live and how can I make sure I never find myself there? 




 In my experience, being friends or in regular communication with an ex is never a good thing for either party.  Move on.  You'll be better off. 




 I don't see there being another phone with this feature.  There's just no usage case that makes it worthwhile.

How do you know when a company is making profit hand over fist?  They come out with silly niche products like Samsung has here. 




 http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/25/google-io-2014-by-the-numbers/

To make the numbers easy, let's just use 1 billion total Android devices.  The OP says builds with less than 0.1% penetration are excluded.  That means, less than a million devices.  Given how the largest markets and most popular devices don't have released L builds yet...It's hardly unreasonable.  




 The point is there are more frequent accidents per capita.  One can draw the conclusion that quality here is not as good as elsewhere.  I linked the weather.com article but there were 10 more just like it referencing the same data. 




 Something seems to be keeping your phone awake a lot when you're not using it.  Do you have a bunch of apps set to auto update your feeds all the time like Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, News Plus, etc.? 




 Ad blocking, yes, need root to be effective.  Ad-Away from F-Droid market (not Play store).

Can Fb/Twitter be uninstalled/disabled in Settimgs  Apps  All?

You might want to check out /r/Android since you seem to be a new user. 




 You will always need to flash a GApps package if you're doing a clean install.  GApps is not now, has never been nor will it ever be included in CM. 




 Not so far.  Less than 2% battery drop overnight (6 hrs 45 minutes) as well. 




 GG4 was announced in mid-November.  This phone was in development since early summer at the latest, so that's why.  They're not trying to screw you, don't worry.  It takes more than a month to design, prototype, test and productionize a new item for sale on the consumer market. 




 I haven't seen either of my cousins in any way other than a Twitter profile pic in 25 years.  So it's entirely possible to not be aware of these things. 




 Well, the entire DC area has statistically speaking more of the worst drivers than anywhere else in the US (not the absolute worst but the greatest quantity of pretty crappy when all the cities are considered):

 Over on the other side of the Potomac we had 142 accidents in one county (Anne Arundel) alone.  I only saw a few flakes as I went through the base gate this morning down here in St. Mary's.  Stay safe out there fellow Mid-Atlanteans. 




 So I'm not sure that the slidey ruler is the best way to determine how much one prefers a particular gender relative to one's own gender.  Also, it might be useful to ask how recently one had sex with same/opposite gender in addition to how often typically.  Also if one is in an LTR... 




 Up until the last few weeks it was black with a few Splendas.  Lately I've taken to adding some milk (say 3 oz in my 24 oz Contigo), which cuts the bitterness more efficiently for me. 




 No. 




 Changing a few suspension bolts and updated engine software do not make a new generation.  Every manufacturer does things like this every year.  When they redesign the HPFP so it doesn't chirp on non-Japanese fuel, THAT will be a generational change.

 First off, take a deep breath.  Second thing, go get a pregnancy test.  If she's missed a cycle then you probably know the result; HOWEVER, stress, diet, etc. can play havoc with women so it doesn't mean she is pregnant necessarily.  Then, depending on the results, consider your options.  You can find out about pro-choice help in MA here: http://www.prochoicemass.org/ 




 NEVER take an update without checking here or on XDA first.  Unless you're stock and are happy being potentially stuck that way forever.

There's at least one in that search.  At first blush I didn't see anything NSFW but no guarantees.  




 Mmmm...Cake.  Mmmm...Pie.

But, what if I'm feeling like tiramisu?  Yep, I said it. 




 Yes, it breaks the Community Guidelines, which I posted in response to several comments earlier this morning. 




 That's incredibly unlikely in the New York metro area.

 yes, there's definitely a risk.

 I reported the comment on YT.  Hopefully others do as well. 




 Noted.  Thanks! 




 Nope, not an engineer.  Source: not looking at his or another person's shoes. 




 Thanks :)  I've got one with my GTO somewhere on my desktop too.  Don't think I'll get one from there with the FR-S though.     




 Anne Rice's Vampires.  No doubt in my mind. 




 Holy wow flowers and chicken parm?  Marry me! 




 Rear fog lights are a luxury only feature in the US, typically only on Mercedes/BMW etc.  My C350 had it.  If you ever see folks driving at night and one taillight is brighter, it's because they're running the rear fog and don't realize it (on my C350 the headlight switch pulled out to turn on fogs - first detent was front and second was front and rear together).

 We need a version of this as Saved by the Thrones since someone mentioned Sansa as Kelly Kapowski up above.  Littlefinger as Belding, how bout it? 




 What are you to do?  Simple.  Date.  See where it goes, if anywhere.  Maybe slow down on the sex and get to know him more.  Don't count your chickens before they're hatched. 




 Treasure Island?  Taken pics there many times over the years.  Usually I go on the west side of the gate facing the city and hope for a moment alone.  Doesn't always work out though.  This was from visiting family before we moved to MD in 2013 (the Ram).

 Skydragon is very popular on the Verizon side.  Has a good thread going for TMoCo as well.  OP over on XDA isn't being updated, but thread is.  Latest build version looks to be 1.1.0, linked in this post

 You guys both did an absolutely bang up job by the looks of your rides.  Right on!  Can you comment on how much prepaint prep work was required?  Also, paint source? 




 THANK YOU!

 There's also threads over on ft86club all the time by people looking to swap trunks w/spoilers for those without... 




 And they're done this way because of past failures trying to do it all at once. 




 Plenty of folks (and there are a ton of Canadians over at ft86club.com) recommend snow tires and some weight.  A little caution goes a long way - no matter your vehicle you shouldn't be putting yourself in a situation where severe rotation is a possibility.  Modulate that throttle pedal, it's not an on/off switch. 




 OFT can do anything ECUTek can, short of auto rev match (so far).  It can be used to do dyno tuning, just like ECUTek can be used to create off the shelf tunes, which many people seem to think is the only thing an OFT can do.  And unlike ECUTek, OFT doesn't permanently modify your ECU at memory locations that can't otherwise be accessed.  Plus it's about half the price (if you buy the cable, and it doesn't look like you did).

 You take that back! 




 Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization.

I say "your" civilization because, when we began thinking for you it really became "our" civilization. 




 Ugh, tell me about it.  35 in less than 6 mos.  I used Mosaic when I was a kid.  And Simpletext for writing websites.
