 The [Brazen Bull](http://cdn8.openculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/brazen-bull.jpg) 









 When I have a great interaction as a customer, I make sure I get their name, and then . . . 

- As I walk to my car I use Maps.Google.com to get the store/restaurant phone #

- I immediately call on speaker phone so I can do it NOW while I'm driving and it costs me no time

- I ask to speak to the Mgr, and say "Hey, you need to know what just happened with one of your employees . . ."

- As they brace for yet another complaint, I hit them with how fantastic Jane was (and why), and it's people like this that make me a loyal customer.

I guarantee: you, the manager, and the employee will all have a better day because you took the time. 

Edit: I thought about it, and I agree that an email, if you really will take the time, is even better since it creates a permanent record. I will now do both. 




  why you do bank on the hypothesis of a successful uprising

Did you even read my posts? I clearly stated:

"And, to be clear, Jang Jin-sung said the internal solution is "the forces of the market", not an overthrow of the government."

Attempting to converse with you is pointless. I'm out.  




 Thank you for the correction and additional info. 

I heard about this on a radio program and it was absolutely frightening. 

To be dismissed as dead, as you hear everything around you, with no way to break through, and to live that way for years, that would be crazy making.  




 As a matter of pure statistics, it would be highly improbable that Trump would not present some positions now and then that actually make sense.  




  Go check yourself

I checked. Can confirm. Trump is an [ass-hat](https://sfcmac.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/asshat.jpg) 




 black hole in my brain	

collider pushing limits

 I know, right? Yet I get downvoted without . . . oh, why bother? 




 And this is how the revolt began: 

"The type of robot that crushed the employee is usually kept in a cage. The man was working on the robot inside the cage when he was grabbed." 




 I skimmed the article, and here are some snippets: 

**Operation Uranus**: encirclement of the German Sixth Army to envelop German Army and Romanian headlong. Soviet troops were not without problems, due to commonly arriving late. Soviet forces on Axis forces, German reserves were not strong enough to parry the Soviet spearheads, did not react quickly enough to disengage. Soviet forces linked up encircling some men instead of attempting to break out of the encirclement. 




 You are more fired than a Mexican, drug-dealing, rapist, criminal. 




 It, and he, are an **Ass-Hat**. 




 Yah - but just in case ... 




 This guy is a walking **ass hat** - - in more ways than one. 




 **Being "boxed"**. That is being in what looks like a vegetative state, but you can hear everything that is going on, but you cannot respond in any way. 




 Costco/Kirkland products are frequently made by big brand suppliers.

Ex: Kirkland coffee is supplied by Starbucks. 




 Wow - solid post. I was just going to post: "**I would smile**". 




  The woman police said Coleman shot and injured was Coleman's grandmother.

The sentence The Charlotte Observer printed Marusak wrote and butchered was Marusaks work product. 




 Very timely. A group of a-holes have have been *"causing emotional distress" on the Internet* to me. I've been pretty well traumatized. Who  do I contact about [this crap?](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2013/0168/latest/DLM5711810.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_Harmful+Digital+Communications+Bill_resel_25_a p=1) 




 "So if you ~~at a govt job~~ owned slaves for 20+ years, and out of nowhere they change the ~~duties of your job~~ law to include something that may go against your morals. Do you feel they have a right to ~~fire you~~ take away your property? Have you ever heard of grandfathering people in?"

Interesting argument. I'll need to think about that one. 




 The mechanic is expired.  




  if they enforced federal law and raided pot dispensaries legal under state law ...

Like I give a flying fuck. There's this thing called Google. If you type in "DEA raids dispensary" you get:

- DEA Raids 2 Los Angeles Medical Marijuana Dispensaries

- DEA raids four Denver marijuana sites

- DEA raids 10 pot shops - LA Times

- DEA Raid Legal Medical Marijuana Dispensary...Again

- DEA Raids Washington Marijuana Dispensaries

BTW - I'm no "kid", as if that makes any difference in the veracity of my arguments vs. yours. Good day. 




 Um, Mr. Bennett, we can totally tell that it's you. 




 You know, pitching and catching . . . soon to become catching and pitching.  




 I really hope several judges and clerks push the issue as far as they can. I would love to see federal marshals go in and enforce the law like a replay of "Little Rock Nine" in 1957. 




 If they refuse to do their govt. job, then they should not have that job. I don't care if they are fired, or moved to another position. If they won't do their job they should be gone. 




 Hilarious! I was trying to figure out how he'd be saved by this [lanyard](http://www.sportys.com/media/catalog/product/8/0/8096_2.jpg) 




  the US is due for a fascist dictator . . .  LIBERALS are thankfully preventing that

No, capitalists are preventing that. The wealthy and the corporations are in charge and have the most influence on who gets elected and on what policies are enacted. 

U.S. Politicians are much more like puppets than dictators.  




 My library even has a flier describing how to copy the file so it never expires . . . AKA piracy.  




 "The airline purchased an additional 23 safety lanyards following the accident and reinforced procedures for their optional use."

What are these "safety lanyards" and how would they prevent this? 




  Military intervention? Covert ops? Peaceful dialogue between the two Koreas?

Do you really think any country is going to invade NK? And if they did, that NK wouldn't detonate nuclear bombs before facing defeat? In reality it wouldn't get that far since China would step in immediately. 

Covert ops? You don't think that was tried as NK was developing their nuclear program? It was. It failed.

"Peaceful ..." NK is still at war. There is no "peace" yet, and they have NO interest in pursuing peace. So, good luck there.

And, to be clear, Jang Jin-sung said the internal solution is "the forces of the market", not an overthrow of the government. 

I have no solutions other than shaming China into either owning the problem, or getting out of the way of others that want to "influence" the situation.  




 They would never go to prison. They would simply be charged, booked, and spend a few hours in jail before being released pending a plea deal (or, very unlikely, a trial if the prosecutor really wants to make an example of them - not likely). 




  imprisoning people for their religious beliefs

For their beliefs - absolutely NOT.

For illegal actions ABSOLUTELY.

These clerks with convictions have 2 simple remedies: do your job, or work elsewhere. 




  there are alternatives for regime change

Please, do tell. 




 Well played, and very good point.

North Korea confounds me beyond any other country. I have no clue what the right approach might be.

I hate the regime, and my heart goes out to the people. 

From what I've read, I don't think an externally imposed solution makes sense. 

Given that, I see alternatives of (a) status quo, or (b) internal change.

I quoted Jang Jin-sung because I also believe that the change must come from within.  




 If I had to vote right now - I would hold my nose and vote Hillary. 

That said, I don't trust her poll driven "convictions", and I don't think I am alone.

That is why I'm looking/hoping for viable alternatives to step up in the Dem party. 




 I guess I'll just let go, 'cause  . . .

Why did I have to act so mean?

Don't I know I'm human being?

Born of a mother with the love of a father

Reflections come and reflections go

I know sometimes I wanna let go

I know sometimes I want to let go 




 Any publicity is good publicity as long as they spell your name right. 




 Jang Jin-sung says stop funding food aid:

North Korean exiles will tell you that the international community must stop funding food aid. We say this not out of spite with regard to a nation whose leadership invests in luxuries, nuclear tests and missile launches while the welfare of its subjects remains low among its priorities. We say this for pragmatic and humanitarian reasons, because the assumptions that lie behind funding food aid have hindered economic reform in our homeland, not helped it.

Today, the fatal threat for the regime lies not in the outside world, but within the country itself. More specifically, this is the jangmadang  an underground economy arisen from the ashes of economic collapse in the 1990s, and which consist of market activities taking place beyond the remit of the regimes control mechanisms.

In todays North Korea there are two rival forces in battle: the forces of the regime and the forces of the market. The formers interests are better served by the maintenance of existing party, military and surveillance mechanisms of control. The latter are equivalent to North Koreas progressives, who believe in a future that is possible beyond the absolute, stifling and structurally inhumane confines of the regime.

An international community wishing to assist the North Korean people should recognise that funding food aid is a channel of limited efficiency. The majority of North Koreans depend not on the regimes munificence but on market forces  they have already found this a more successful alternative, despite a disproportionate lack of international support or awareness.

Jang Jin-sung was one of Kim Jong-ils favourite state poets until he defected in 2004. He founded the North Korea news website New Focus International 




 Hey OP - That's a lot of bull!

I think that is in line with what Quasy1999 is talking about. But, whatever . . .  




 No surprise here:

"upheld a ruling that determined Apple to be the leader of an industrywide conspiracy among book publishers to raise prices of digital books." 




 I was slammed by Reddit for saying this previously, but I truly feel that Clinton's toughest fight is against herself. She is just so prone to missteps, and actions that appear dishonest, that she will likely continue to alienate her base.

That escalated quickly. (that said, I agree with you entirely)  




 I try to keep it positive. 

I'm tryin', Ringo. I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you. 




 Elizabeth Warren for VP !!!

Clearly a tragic situation and outcome.

But ... HOW? ... Did she sleep at night, then go back to . . .

Just scary to even think about. 




 I find it hard to believe that **racism** and **hate crimes** are not involved here. 




 Yah, like I'm supposed to believe that. 




  you are cherry-picking

So posting current YTD and prior year (past 18 months) performance fits your definition of "cherry-picking"?

As an investor, I respectfully disagree.

 Thank you for putting this out there. Schwarzenegger is an ass. Very successful, but still an a-hole. 

Judge Lloyd Connelly called Schwarzenegger's decision to reduce Esteban Nunez's sentence from 16 years to seven years distasteful and "repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state," but within his executive powers as governor.

 This is such bullshit! Another blow to freedom.

Judge Michael Mosman of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ruled late on Monday that the Second Circuit was wrong and that the program could resume.

"Second Circuit rulings are not binding on the F.I.S.C. and this court respectfully disagrees with that courts analysis, especially in view of the intervening enactment of the U.S.A. Freedom Act," he wrote. 




 Flying kites at the beach. 




 The sounds were accompanied by a shock wave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometres away. The majority of witnesses reported only the sounds and the tremors, and did not report seeing the explosion. The explosion registered at seismic stations across Eurasia. It is estimated that, in some places, the resulting shock wave was equivalent to an earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale. It also produced fluctuations in atmospheric pressure strong enough to be detected in Great Britain.

 The Investor-State Dispute Settlement, or ISDS is [*The Trans-Pacific Partnership clause everyone should oppose*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kill-the-dispute-settlement-language-in-the-trans-pacific-partnership/2015/02/25/ec7705a2-bd1e-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html) (By Elizabeth Warren February 25)

ISDS would allow foreign companies to challenge U.S. laws  and potentially to pick up huge payouts from taxpayers  without ever stepping foot in a U.S. court. Heres how it would work. Imagine that the United States bans a toxic chemical that is often added to gasoline because of its health and environmental consequences. If a foreign company that makes the toxic chemical opposes the law, it would normally have to challenge it in a U.S. court. But with ISDS, the company could skip the U.S. courts and go before an international panel of arbitrators. If the company won, the ruling couldnt be challenged in U.S. courts, and the arbitration panel could require American taxpayers to cough up millions  and even billions  of dollars in damages.
