 I feel like we need a picture of your cat OP 




  I SAID BOIL THE NOODLES.

Yes food sorcerer. 




 There is a hidden benefit with this fad at least. Because there are more and more people who eat gluten free, this means that more and more companies are producing gluten free options. Actual celiacs should be happy with that at least lol 




 I thought this was a poignant statement about the real issue we face todo with the mass death of bees.

Then I read the last line and I'm not sure if you were just setting up a pun. 




 Have you checked the fridge? That's where mine hides. 




 This is why I use the metric system in my private life. Who wants to measure flour by horses? 




 Oh god this is hilarious, I didn't want to spell the joke out or it would lose its oompf :P

Don't worry, upvotes for you 




 Nah, I've sworn off Dim Sims. Thanks though. 




 I agree with you, it's perfectly healthy to want to play around with tasty food. What I think the OP is getting at, is for some people to distance themselves from romanticising some foods.

If you take a step back and look at sugar from a pragmatic standpoint, having a can of coke is fucking stupid lol 




 It took a bit for me to realise this. I initially dealt with those 10pm cravings you get by having an apple. That did the trick, but now I realise that this 'hunger' I feel isn't that big of a problem and while that apple is fucking delicious, I ask myself "Is this superficial hunger really worth the 100 calories this apple will give me?" The answer is invariably **no**.

My daily intake budget is set in stone so that those extra calories are just that, extra. Still love me some fresh apples though. 




 Now I'm up shit creek without a paddle and a canoe :( 




 20 dozen eggs isn't impressive? That's 240 eggs, that's 40 omelets. If scrambled that's 19,200 calories.

If that doesn't impress you, just picture 20 egg cartons.  




 why does it need your name

So that they can complete the police report in conjunction with your 'missing' dogs. They're onto you.. 




 They're surprisingly dense and a 15 lb watermelon is rather large 




 Holy shit, that's a lot of damn cheese. We sell 1kg blocks of cheese in Australia, imagine 13 and a half of [these bad boys](http://shop.coles.com.au/online/national/coles-cheese-block-tasty-287609p) 




 *whoosh* 

haha 




 That's great, but what did the website tell you that you've lost? 




 Using the ['I lost what?'](http://ilostwhat.com/) website, what have you lost so far?


I apparently have lost a 15 foot canoe lol 




 Really good post, the concept of skinny is lost on many of us.

Skinny is just an obese person sans fat.

We're not the default position. 




 It's all about willpower, something which all of us losers need.

You need to show to yourself that you can say no, easier said than done sadly 




  If you're in a rocking chair or a knitter (like me) you'll have to take it off for those because it will count them as steps.

Also when you're adjusting change in your pockets aggressively for 2-5 minutes. 




  Swiggity swooty, I'm coming to congratulate you on your great success towards your weight goals.

I have no idea why I find this sentence hilarious 




 He is better, thanks for asking.

The whole 'playing the field' thing isn't important unless you make it so. I personally couldn't care less how many people I've hooked up with as long as I've found the right chick. You may very well be the same, but that can only come from being conscious of the need, if you have it :)

Best of luck on the dating scene :) 




 Karma.

You'd be surprised how many people love the validation of internet points. 




 The 'fuck Jenny' thing was a massive TIFU post about a man who accidently discovered that his wife Jenny was cheating on him with another man, he then documented his clandestine discovery of her infidelity with the help of a private detective. It was this whole indepth thing a while back. He ended up deleting everything shortly after and people started noticing holes in his story, it was likely just some dude making shit up.

The 'F' thing is an injoke about a Call of Duty game. There is a cut scene where you're at a funeral and to progress the scene you have to press 'F' to 'Pay your respects'. This is of course the butt of  all jokes because of it being a stupid example of 'game immersion'. So when someone posts 'F', they're 'paying respects' to the poster. 




 If you **know** that you're about to get a job. Get a credit card. Credit cards get a bad rap, but only by those who don't know how to use them properly.

Credit cards should be used for mini loans, not for constant expenses. Using credit cards, then paying the money back also establishes a credit history which in the long run will be beneficial to yourself. 




 It's always been a thing for moronic dudes who have no concept of STDs. 

Wear a fucking rubber with strangers people. Jesus. 




 I did and I feel rather crappy about it.

Many years ago I met and hooked up with this gorgeous girl who was on a 'temporary break' from a guy she was dated (he has the same exact first name as me lol). Anyway, we had a insanely strong connection and she contacted me after getting serious with her BF. So we started a platonic friendship and we had the absolute best time. We became fast friends. Would talk most days and nights.

Things with the BF had always been on the rocks, he was emotionally distant and she couldn't date him anymore. She ended up leaving him for me and we had the most incredible relationship I've ever experienced in my life to date. 

I've always felt kind of responsible for it, but I've been assured that the relationship would've been over even without my existence.  




 Lets look at this issue in context. Let's say you meet a guy and go out for a few dates. Are you going to be talking about how many guys you've dated at this stage? Not likely, I doubt he'd ask and you'd tell.

So in essence, it's not relevant. 

However.

It's important for you to know yourself. What I mean is, following the above example, let's say you guys date for a few years and get engaged and married.

Is your inexperience likely to affect your relationship with someone that you're now fully committed to? Do you think that you could settle down with someone when you've never seriously dated anyone else?

These questions are important for yourself because I could think of little worse than being married and having kids, then realising "Oh shit, I *need* to play the field". Which causes problems in the relationship.

Sorry for rambling, but I have a close friend whose girlfriend of 10 years left him because "she wanted to fuck around and didn't get to do that in her early 20s". Completely fucked him up, they were about to get married. 




 I'll add that these are not the two best dramas, nor are they even the two best HBO dramas. 

But If I had to choose, I'd say The Sopranos. I say that with lots of reluctance though.

Oz is truly amazing but it's brutal. Like, really brutal.

That scene with the spoon? I don't want to watch that for a second time. 

 




 I've been losing weight for the past 4 months and part of that is being sober. I honestly thought the hardest part of giving up beer would be the parties. 

It's easier than you think.

I drink nothing, maybe water if I'm thirsty. Our culture dictates that you need to get drunk to have fun but that's total nonsense. I'm not going to stay away from drinking for ever (I love the taste of beer still), but my view on alcohol and the obsession people in their 20s have with it has changed over the past 4 months. 




 I used to work manual labour (roofing) and 8 hours of work would fly by

You answered your own question, you work hard.

I work a 42.5 hour week doing software development and my week days go incredibly quick. But that only happens when I keep myself busy with work. 




 euphemistic treadmill

Oh, I like that 




 I compare any sort of past time to the most common past time.

**Seeing a movie**.

In Australia, an adult movie ticket costs $20~ AUD. That $20 provides 90-120 minutes of entertainment.

So if I spend $18 for a month of wow and get literal weeks of entertainment, I consider it worth it, by comparison.

Using a better example, I played competition 8-ball 6 months out of the year. So every week, I pay my $12 playing fee and I attend 3-4 hours of practice on Mondays and I play for 4 hours on a comp night. When you take a step back and look at it, the cost vs entertainment duration factor (for me) makes me consider a hobby as *worth it*.  




 I'm 5'9 1/2, I honestly couldn't care less. My latest girlfriend was a netball player who was 5'10, the people who care about something so silly are the people who are focusing on the wrong thing about a girl.

Height doesn't matter. 




 This happens so often, when the guy in delicately rubs the girls clit during sex and you can see the girl isnt into it. 
This hurts the clit, some may be into that much pressure but it would say most dont 




 Not even kidding, i have never and will never fap to porn with fake boobs in it. Id rather watch porn with a girl who has small ones. 


Its almost like a boycott. 




 Balding by 22, GG sexiness. 




 PERFECT, this is what the character needed in the MCU. A young and relatively unknown actor, had it have been some better known person like Miles Teller, it would've been really distracting.

I'm excited. 




 Obviously Im talking about your average drinker and not someone who binges on booze every single day. 




 My mum asked me "so they're giving my email address out, what's the big deal?"

The internet is still very much the wild west as far as privacy is concerned. 




 By my count, you look like you just earned a new /r/loseit flair! Well done :)

Assuming you're a man in your 20s, we have very similar stats :D 




 It really makes me thankful that my over eating was just due to being a lazy person who loved food more than wanting to be healthy. I can't even imagine how much harder my progress would have been if I had had the same situation as you :(

That being said, congratulations on the progress you have made I really am hopeful I'll get the flair that you have soon :) 




 I like that there is a real lack of shit posting. I know this subreddit cops some flak from other places due to the celebration of the little victories (Been a week since my last soda, etc), but there are so many of us for whom these small victories add real help.

 




 OH man, how good are scrambled eggs!

Any other Aussies out there, try scrambled eggs on Vegemite toast.

Tasty as shit. 




 Yeah, his first kill was a 1 on 1 fight with a bandit IIRC. Or was Barristan? 




 It is true, but it's certainly not healthy. 

My calf muscles are actually huge due to carrying around my fat arse all of these years.  




 I think on of the problems is equating exercise with weight loss. How many times have you heard someone say "I would like to lose weight, but I don't have enough time for the gym'. I was one of those people not that long ago, we need it to be common knowledge that weight loss is primarily done with diet. Exercise is recommended but not wholly necessary. 

Also people find dieting hard because they think a diet should be excluding food instead of the better option - eat the foods you want to eat, just less and with better balance. 

I love me some steak, I really do. I'm not going to give that up. So I just buy smaller and more lean cuts and make sure that I have something green in my sides. It's so easy that I'm kicking myself that I didn't start sooner.

40 lbs down and counting :)  




 Speaking as someone who (at their worse) was 100 lbs overweight. Do something about it now. I'm facing a probably bout with loose skin once I finally get my weight down to normal, I wish I had made these choices when I was at your weight ratio.

Best of luck, that rationalising can be dangerous for sure. 




 You're going to see weight problems due to drinking long before you'll see liver disease problems due to drinking.

The empty calories in booze are some of the most brutal, I'm down 40 lbs in 4 months - most of this is due to being sober. 




 Please tell me that the sex scene with John Cena (Sex Cena lol) is as hilarious as it is in the trailer 




 There are so many fucking assholes in porn. 




 I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the OP doesn't really care about girls wearing make up, he's just painting a picture of someone who goes to the gym to be seen, rather than going there for a workout.

I find those people annoying too, it's like those people who take endless selfies of everything they do. 




 Their are plenty of reasons why people do this, I'm not sure why your so upset. It's probably just you're sensitivities. 




 I know there are greater ones, but this one is so powerful even though it's really short.

The final scene we have with Jesse in Breaking Bad. Where he's in the car, we get that close up of Jesse doing a mix of crying, screaming and laughing. It's an incredible moment which required no words. It was all in that facial expression - amazingly well acted.

He had been in captivity for months, saw his girlfriend executed and had finally been given his freedom after confronting Walter and gotten closure against Todd. He perfectly expressed that incredible mix of emotion to the screen. It was so emotionally solid that it didn't need a follow up "X months later" scene. 




 In Australia - we got rid of them too. The 1 and 2 cent coins are gonzo :) 




 I dislike her no less than book Dany. I'm just not a fan of her story arc :(

I empathise with the character, I just don't find it interesting. 




 Total and complete chaos. I agree, who will side with who? Jon was the fabric which kept the peace. How will the wildlings (led by Tormund) act with such chaos? The Nights Watch may very well be exterminated. Far out, TWOW is going to be awesome. 




 I normally respond with "I believe in total equality between all genders". Social egalitarian I think is the more broad moniker I identify with. 




 Dredd was good because of this.

More recently? Kingsman - they could've easily made Roxie a love interest, but they decided to focus elsewhere. 




 The fondest memories I have growing up was when my brother, myself and my father spend 6 months putting 3 broken 1980s dirt bikes back together. We would spend hours **every** weekend slowing building them back up. I learned so much and loved it. They were all in such disrepair. One was launched into a river, one had caught fire and my one had broken in two.

For those interested, two of the bikes were 1981 Suzuki TS185 and the other was a 1982 Suzuki DR250. We ended up having those bikes for many years. My TS185 sadly was destroyed when our shed caught on fire and the DR250's engine finally gave out. My brothers TS185 is still kicking around though :)

I treasure those memories 




 holy shit, this is some real talk right here 




 My friends call each other douchebags all the time, if it were serious then yes, it would be an insult.  




 Actually yes! Same sex love is a major factor, especially between a main character and another one.

It's kind of like a Ross and Rachel thing, but with far more gay sex. 




 They're so fucking different. I loved Oz and I love OITNB, but they're totally apples and oranges.

With OITNB there is no where near as much tension, it's more about the characters and their back stories. It definitely leans more to the drama and comedy side.

Oz is a brutal crime drama, holy crap do they deal with some real issues. There is always a sense of doom and worry with most scenes. Oz is definitely not for the faint hearted. It is an excellent show however.

To be honest, I probably wouldn't watch OITNB if it weren't as R rated as it is. This isn't just because of the nudity, it's because of the language and the subject matter. They could've easily made it a PG tv series, but that would've taken the realism involved with it. 




 Not quite that extreme, but with an ex I would wake up to find her resting her hand down there. I asked her about it and she said something about it just 'being nice to hold while going to sleep'.

Go figure :) 




 Don't forget free time, the extra money is nice but having the free time is also a benefit. 




 Welcome aboard, come to Melbourne - the greatest city in Australia :P 




 I've actually had this too, half of the girls I've dated have been against getting head. It's been for a variety of reasons too. One of them even said "I once had a guy do it so well that it has ruined head for me", which is kind of stupid. 

Sucks too, I love doing it :( 




 This is actually a concern for me going into the future. I'm in the process of losing weight and getting fit again (40 lbs down so far, yay!). Knowing what I know now and doing what I'm doing now - I'll be keeping this lifestyle for the rest of my days.

But with that comes the fear that I won't meet someone else who is as health conscious as I am now. I've been on the receiving end of this topic and it fucking hurts. Sorry I don't have an answer for you, it's a tough thing to bring up. 









 And I know, who will sit on the Iron Throne."

Woah that's a massive deal! How did I find this quote like 5 comments down 




 Interesting idea, but we see at the end how he shuts the lights off his bike, we can see his face, it seems like he suddenly gets frustrated. Frustrated because he doesn't have the guts to commit to suicide? Or perhaps (following your impression) frustrated because he can't match this mysterious rush he is trying to replicate. 




  How likely is it that a guy that age and in that kind of shape is impotent?

PTSD can manifest with impotence, it can also manifest with hypersexuality. I like the gay angle (phrasing?), it could be both.  




 So going into this episode I was concerned about Taylor Kitsch's character. The pilot has alleviated those concerns. He was the character I most empathised with.

I have a sneaking suspicion that this bribery lie will come back to bite him in the arse. To us, we can see that he most likely didn't accept the sexual bribe (since he cant get it up), but he's probably going to have to accept the potential consequences of the accusation **or** he will have to prove that he couldn't have done it due to his impotence.

I loved the pilot, I'm so fucking amp'd for the rest of the season.

Edit: Alleviated not elevated lol 




 Thread's over boys, who wants some candy? 




 Hahaha I remember that feeling. I was like "Woah, what the hell is that. What ever I'm doing feels so much better". 




 I had the same condom break issue, when I told my dad he asked me "How can you break a condom? Doesn't the smell of burning rubber tell you that you should slow down?"

Thanks dad, I'm a 17 year old having a freak out and you're joking around. 




 Because Fathers day is still months away.

 If you loved the movie, check the TV series out! It really grasps what made the first movie so special. The show is essentially a 10 hour Fargo movie.

Season 2 is airing shortly :) 




  That's why I never let a guy choose where to finish. You can't sticky me without my consent!

 You're right, I've found there is a middle ground though. I've looked at all of the food I love and I know the rough calories for them. With that knowlege I make mental guestimations for my daily meals.

I'm 40 lbs down in 15 weeks without doing daily accurate counting.

This isn't for everyone, but I'm a slave to routine, so it's just what I find easiest. 




 I was thinking something similar when I saw that doco. I think their point was that sugar is the culprit, when copious amounts is consumed. A donut here and there isn't going to fuck up your weight loss efforts (you're the case in point). But those who have shit loads of sugar in their diet will feel the effects described in the doco. 




 I found out that a close family memeber was into inter racial preggo porn. 

yeesh. 




 Yeah, when I said 'nothing' I didn't mean literally not moving haha

I still went out and did stuff. I just didn't alot any time for strenuous exercise :) 




 When I was 12 I accidentally stole a penguin eraser. I was in a souvenir shop and I accidentally bumped into a shelf which had all of these novelty erasers on them. I turned to try to catch what ever I had knocked over. But as I looked down, I saw nothing fall. I was sure something fell.

Anyway, fast forward 25 minutes on the next leg of our drive. I reached into my jacket's side pocket and found a penguin eraser. Turns out my subconscious is a slight of hand master and when I bumped into the shelf, the eraser fell perfectly into my jacket pocket.


Yes, I have had a boring and legal life. 




 Hi. I'm a 27 year old Australian. We have had fluoride introduced to our water systems since the 70s. I'm part of the first generation to be brought up on it. 

I don't know of a single person in my generation who has teeth problems. There are some (mainly who don't do any dental care), but most of us have strong and healthy teeth. Look at the baby boomer generation by comparison.

Fluoride addition has saved the average person hundreds and thousands of dollars worth of dental bills.  




 Nonsense, it's not a fucking waste. The pron industry (which we **all** love) has been gutted by piracy. I pay for a sub because I wan't to support the companies so that legit companies don't go under (giggity).

That's like saying "Paying for HBO is such a waste, just torrent". 




 Ever had onion salad? That shit is amazing and there is no lettuce to be found.

How it's made? Chop a bunch of onions and tomatoes, mix them in a bowel with a dressing made of vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper.

You'll be tasting the deliciousness with every burp for weeks.

Warning, only eat when single and not wanting a relationship. 




 I should clarify. I exercise on the weekends. Friday-Sunday. So I do vigorous sessions all 3 days. The past week I added extra days worth of work on tuesday and wednesday so by the time it hit the weekend I had been working out 5 out of the 7 past days. 



 




 My work schedule is flexible, I can start when I want as long as I do my 8.5 hours.

So I've found that it's much better to start at 7am to finish at 3:30pm. Having those extra hours before dinner is amazing.  




 Why not just plain water? None of those drinks actually refresh you as much as ice cold water 




 I get that, to a degree. It's healthy to have apprehension towards foods that's you know are high in calories. It can however be ok to have a little bit of those types of foods every now and again.

I remember feeling a moment of sadness when I saw how many calories were in a short stack of pancakes with ice cream and maple syrup. It had been years since I've had that, but it all hit me that I won't be eating that stuff for a while.

I guess you don't know what you've got till it's gone. 




 Another week, another loss. 40 lbs down in 15 weeks :)

But that's not the main reason I'm posting. I'm also posting to remind everyone to **take a day off once in a while from exercising** .

For the past few weeks I've kinda gotten a bit obsessed with getting into shape, so much so that I was not really giving my body a chance to recover. So what did I do yesterday as far as exercise is concerned? Absolutely nothing and it felt great. Having an exercise cheat day is as helpful for the soul as having a cheat meal is for a diet.

I'm giving myself a day or so of rest, then it's back on the horse!

**Edit:** For the sake of clarity, I exercise on the weekends. Friday through Sunday. What brought on this break was adding extra days during last week. This meant by the time it hit yesterday (Sunday), I've been at the gym almost everyday. I could tell my body needed a break. So when I say *take a day off*, I mean take a day (that you would otherwise be exercising on) off. 




   and I get the smugness of getting him off.

I love that this quality is shared between the genders.

 It was a rather contentious issue with my last relationship and I'm suspecting my weight was largely related.

How has your loss affected you? 




 Totally, for me my last break up was clean as fuck. Literally I broke it off with her, we had a mature and adult discussion about it. I then left and we've not spoken since.

It was truly bizarre. What I did notice though. I felt 10000000x times better after doing it.

I'm now 100% sure that staying in a relationship that you don't want to be in is bad for you. 




 I so was committed to my indifference that I honestly couldn't tell you.

It would've just been awkward if we spoke TBH, we've not spoken since the break up. 




 I can't even fathom being back in onederland. 5'9 SW:285 CW:247.

I'm going to try to get there before 2016 :) 




 A 2014 series called Manhattan. It's incredible.. I've watched through it twice now and season 2 should be airing shortly.

It's a period drama set in the Manhattan Project, there is some artistic licence but it's mainly about the struggles of two different types of atom bombs. It has intrigue, science and great dialogue. 

Definitely check it out. 




 It happened recently actually, I just pretended I didn't notice her and keep walking.
