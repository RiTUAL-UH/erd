 In all seriousness [this](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15563650500514590?journalCode=ctx) is the only source for the Romans-eating-it stuff but it's behind a hefty paywall for me. If anyone has free access to it it would be fascinating what if any sources they had for ancient Romans doing this. 




 How about this one? If identical twin men have sex with a woman at the same time and get her pregnant with non-identical twins, there's no way of knowing if they are full siblings, half siblings, or even who their father is! 




 [This one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2co5kb/til_of_the_dream_fish_a_fish_that_causes_you_to/). The link doesn't work. 




 [Another story](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28811232) on this beetle appears to have the answer, which is a little unexpected:

 Cyphochilus beetles are native to South-East Asia, where they live among white fungi.

 This new study proves that they have been optimised by natural selection to be camouflaged among their surroundings, while keeping the scales as light as possible - which is crucial for flying insects. 














 [Here is a recent piece by that guy telling the story.](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/what-i-did-after-police-killed-my-son-110038.html#.U_NpBFHfu5k).  
























 One of the least insane posts I have seen in the last few months. 




 Some people think that's the way natural right-handers *should* play golf, because the leading arm in a golf swing should be the dominant/stronger arm. The leading arm in a "left-handed" swing is the right arm. 









 This is a real Collector's item! 




 The paper is [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/ecoop14-tsls.pdf) (PDF). 





























 [Here's a video of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPYwlXOTzQ), probably from the 90s when the Indian authorities made some efforts to contact them (which they do not do any more). Amazing stuff. 




 How many times has a random stranger asked you to say "One does not simply ... (insert line here)"? 




 It is more accurate to say that 96% of the matter/energy in the universe is undetectable, but is predicted to be there by our current model of physics.

Either it is there and our current model of physics works for it, or it is not there and our current model of physics is wrong. 




 Not many. Don't shoot the messenger! I just pointed out that they have a rule and that it's strictly enforced. I'm neither endorsing nor disfavoring the rule.

^(The story in this post I find personally very interesting, however.) 




 From the [rules for submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules):

 Every submission must be a direct link to or a summary of peer-reviewed research with appropriate citations.

 




 It has become clear that there is an important eukaryotic component to the gut microbiome of ruminant mammals, mainly in the form of anaerobic fungi and protozoa. However, when we talk about the human intestinal microbiome we always hear about bacteria. My two questions are: Are there eukaryotes in the human gut microbiome? If so, do they play an important role, with potential clinical implications? 









  The process by which the medication was made available to Brantly and Writebol is highly unusual. It may have fallen under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "compassionate use" regulation, which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials. Getting approval for compassionate use is often long and laborious. 

A sad fact is we're looking at years if not decades before this treatment is approved for widespread use after the requisite clinical trials, and even then it may be prohibitively expensive for use in Africa. I may be proven wrong, but I don't see it being distributed to the hundreds of sick in the current outbreak.  














 Seems to be so. Comments in the article and /u/arrc clear that up. 




 My bad, I just trusted the article, including its headline. That's a pretty awful error on their part. 




 Well, if that's the case, a remastered release of the trilogy on next-gen while we wait, *please*! 




 All are good summaries but to clarify, the stop being negative one is in particular about other people. Quote:

 Needing to talk badly about others indicates low self-esteem. That means, 'I feel so low that instead of picking myself up I have to cut others down,' 

 




 Steer clear of the comments below OP's article, fellow redditor - it must have been linked by the Drudge Report or something. 









 Well he's got an appropriate name if that's the case. 




 This is what you have to do when there's no bale of hay down there.

 So this is after one of Liberia's top doctors dies yesterday. This is sad and scary. 




 Aussie and Kiwi kids have been doing this [at their schools.](http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/google-maps-still-shows-giant-graffiti-penis-graffiti-at-schools-many-years-after-they-were-drawn/story-fnjwnhzf-1226902303410). Heck, one kid drew a penis on the Google Street View *camera* itself.

 This seems fitting, since marijuana legalization will do a great deal to reduce the incarceration rate.  




 That last quote is actually paraphrased from this Hadith:

 Classic. [Here's what Justin has to say about that.](http://i.imgur.com/Gty6OM4.gif) 




 [He died in 2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Sendak) by the way, so it's not an is but a was. 














 The British were awful to the Australian Aborigines, no doubt about that, *but*, from OP's first paragraph:

 A number of historians point to **introduced disease** as the major cause of the destruction of the full-blooded Aboriginal population.

A similar thing happened to native populations in Central and South America upon arrival of the Spanish.

 Oh boy, that video is painful. The guy doesn't know he's in a hole and keeps on digging and digging.

 Here's something mildly interesting: Israel's [worst ever defeat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_national_football_team) in soccer was 7-1 against Germany. The exact same scoreline and opponent as Brazil's recent humiliation in the world cup, to which the Israeli gentleman was referring. 




 Yeah, his imitation isn't bad. Needs more tongue out. 



















 I'd bet the farm that the NHL is the least provincial by this metric. 




  10 crew members were onboard. 9 were killed in the crash except the Navigator, 2nd Lt Wallace F. Kaufman. He was captured by the Japanese and executed. 

Sobering. 




 This needs to be higher. FGM is only widespread in Africa and has little to do with radical Islam. I hate ISIS with a passion, to put it mildly, but this story doesn't make much sense. I'll believe it when they themselves publicize it. 














 And that's what you're made of.

You can't make this stuff up. 




 To paraphrase Hitchens: give that guy an enema and you can bury him in a matchbox. 




 The pilot who shot down the plane [gave an interview late last year](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/131224/ex-pilot-says-he-performed-duty-shooting-down-s-korea-). He says he was following orders and has frequent nightmares about the incident, but these parts stand out, there are many coping mechanisms for the unthinkable or inexplicable:

  But some Russians still believe no passengers were on board on the Korean Air Lines' jumbo, including Osipovich's wife Lyudmila.

 Lyudmila, 67, told Kyodo News that her husband did nothing wrong, claiming the United States has woven a false story and that no passengers were on board.

 But Osipovich said he saw only the South Korean plane and no U.S. military planes, and that he is sure there were passengers on the plane. 




 I imagine the flight data recorder could in theory be used to determine the *direction* of the missile's impact, based on tiny differences in the times certain components failed. If this is the case, it could be very incriminating when combined with known locations of any surface to air missile sites in the area.  




 Here is an [AN-26](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-26). Can they be that stupid to confuse this with a 777? Apparently so. 




 You can find it at /r/undelete 




 Glenn Greenwald lives in Rio, you can add him if you want. 




 There are Brazilians of every skin color you can think of. This comment is absurd.
