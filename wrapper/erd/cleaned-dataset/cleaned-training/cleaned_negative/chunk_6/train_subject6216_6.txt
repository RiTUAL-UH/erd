 My friend wants a specific discontinued bath and body works lotion for her Birthday. Breathe Romance. They are super expensive on ebay and I was wondering if there was a good subreddit that I could post and maybe buy a partly used bottle of this stuff for a little cheaper 




 That really does sound lovely. Our weather isn't cooperating at the moment but I appreciate the thought, Thank you 




 Your thoughtfulness is very much appreciated and unexpected, thank you. I sent you a message and can't say how nice it was to receive this one 




 I'm requesting healing and supportive thoughts be sent my way. I'm a strong believer in the power of positive thinking but have not been able to manage it for myself lately. I'll attach a picture and tell a little bit about my situation if that will help any of you focus your intentions.

I am a 23 year old female living in Oklahoma. A little over a month ago, I was released from the hospital after spending a week in inpatient while they switched my medication around. In the past, I've been diagnosed with something called Borderline Personality disorder, which basically means I have trouble controlling my emotions, especially the intense ones. I ended up in the hospital after breaking it off with my then significant other. Even though this was my choice, it left me feeling out of control and a risk to myself.  
  
Sense being released, I have been physically ill for most of the time and am just now starting to feel like I'm close to getting well. I have had strep, a flu bug and an infection over the course of this last month and am absolutely drained. The people at my job, which I have been at for 7 months, really seem to like me a lot but I know my having to be out for the few days that I had to go to the doctor on top of being out for a week in the hospital have put a strain on things here and I'm not exactly viewed as the most reliable person anymore. My worrying over this has also caused me to lose some much needed focus on my tasks.  
  
I take naps immediately after I get home from work every day and I know it is worrying my roommate, but I am just so tired all the time that I can't help it.  
  
I miss having energy and motivation to do things. I miss being reliable at work. I hate feeling lonely all the time and doing dumb impulsive things in attempt to put a proverbial bandage over that feeling.  
  
I have just completed my orientation process for volunteering a couple shifts each week at the children's hospital and I'm really hoping my severe lack of energy doesn't effect my ability to complete these shifts. Its so important to me to be able to have some kind of interaction with people.  
  
I could really use positive, encouraging and healing thoughts being sent my way. 














 I don't have a therapist I see anymore, haven't had one for about 3 years. I have decided there isnt much more I can do other than check myself in. Im trying to work up the courage to go but Im really scared. I dont like not knowing how long theyll keep me for 




 This will be a messy post, I'm sure.  
Running on very little sleep the past few days.

Where to start.. Maybe a little about myself. I'm a 24 year old female. Friday night my significant other decided to break off our relationship. Needless to say this was upsetting, though it wasn't really the problem. The problem is I've been using the relationship as a sort of bandage to cover up numerous insecurities and phobias. Now that its gone, there is nothing holding back the floodgates in my head. Word vomit is spinning in circles around my mind and driving me crazy for lack of a better term. What seems to help quiet the noise in my head is interacting with other people and pacing or doing another activity that requires use of my, at the moment, very limited supply of energy. Friday night, or Saturday morning I should probably say, I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am when I passed out from pure exhaustion. I woke up a little under two hours later after a terrible nightmare and couldn't go back to sleep. I spent the rest of the morning quietly pacing the house and shaking from the effort until my roommate woke up and we could start our day. Now its 2 am on Sunday and I'm so very tired that its making me sick. I'm hungry too but I'm fairly sure if I eat I'll throw up. I seem to have terrible nightmares when I'm stressed and after last night I'm not really eager to do a repeat. But I desperately need to sleep. When I lay down I can't stop the spiral of thoughts from crashing down on me so I started just kind of rocking back and forth and petting my dog, trying really hard to not think about anything at all.  
  
It occurs to me now that its highly doubtful I can function like this at work on Monday, having what will probably be a total of only 4 hours of sleep in a 72 ish hour period. I feel like my body is already trying to shut down. But if I don't go to work then I will need a damn good excuse. At this point, the only thing I can come up with is going to admit myself to the hospital. Which might not be such a bad idea given my mental state, but I'm absolutely terrified of the place.  
  
I had to spend a week in the psychiatric ward about 4 years ago and over half that week was not voluntary. The doctors were not friendly and most of the other patients either annoyed or scared me. Participating in the group activities was very difficult because I'm extremely shy, which made me seem even more difficult to the doctors, who subsequently liked me even less. I could tell I was frustrating them because all I wanted to do was sleep and pace around my room until they fixed my medication to their liking and I could leave. They didn't think fixing my medication was good enough so I asked to leave at which point I was told that I would then be held involuntarily and would end up needing a court order to leave and spend a minimum of 30 days there if I didn't calm down. At that point I became extremely claustrophobic and panicked and spent a day refusing to talk to anyone. They chalked this behavior up to a bad reaction to a new medication they had just tried to switch me to and switch me to something else. Things did get a little better from there but the facility was still very daunting. The sheets were not comfortable to sleep on and having someone come in to my room every hour wore on my nerves to the point where I broke a few times and told them to get out. I try very hard to always be polite and not throw fits like that but to me this hospital environment was truly terrible and I wanted desperately to go home the whole time. Most of the books I asked to be brought I wasn't even allowed to read because they were science fiction and the doctors said that they would encourage some delusions.  
  
I'm not anxious to go back to this hospital for any kind of mental condition. The thought absolutely terrifies me. So does the thought of losing my job and not being able to pay my bills.  
  
I believe if I do admit myself to the hospital, my job cannot legally fire me and likely wouldn't because they do sincerely seem to like me. I've only been at this place for 6 months and already had to miss two days from two separate episodes of strep throat. I hate missing work. I want them to see me as reliable. I'm only a temp and not hired on permanently yet so I'm worried too that if the hospital kept me too long, they could let me go anyways simply because I am only there on a temp basis right now and they don't need a valid reason.  
  
I could try and go to work Monday, but I'm already cringing at the thought. I'm shaking from lack of sleep and trying to exert to much energy today. and I'm physically sick from not being able to eat enough. I feel like throwing up and have a terrible headache from crying and having a little panic attack (at least I think that's what it was, I've never had one of those before).  
  
I work in a cubicle doing data entry. The work is very repetitive and will allow me too much time to dwell on things that I really don't need to be thinking about right now. Which will likely just make me cry and then panic because I can't stop crying and I'd be too near people that they might hear. Talking about my diminished mental state with any of my coworkers is not something I want to do. I do not want to seem mentally unfit in anyway to my boss. I cannot afford to lose this job.  
  
So I am caught between a rock and a very hard place. Going to the hospital would be terrifying and I don't want to do that. Going to work in this state is also equally undesirable.  
  
I am not sure what to do.

And because I feel like I'm out of plausible options, I'm ready to be done with everything. 




 Last nights dream was just weird. And scary. I'm not religious and while I do have nightmares a couple times a week (I usually give my anxious mind credit for these) I can usually see why I might be dreaming of a certain thing. But I was feeling pretty good when I went to sleep last night. And it was the most sleep I had gotten in a couple of days so it should have felt good. I have never dreamed of anything like this before. My dreams/nightmares usually have reoccurring themes like zombies, falling from a high place, seeing people I know or things like that so this is quite perplexing to me.

What I remember is being in a dark cavern like place with glowing veins of red running through the rocks, lava maybe. There were thousand of "demons" around me. That's the only way I would describe them. I woke up immediately knowing that. They all looked different. There were no people around, just me and the demons. And a couple of them were trying to communicate with me, to get me to attack or defend myself from others. I got the feeling that I was probably demonic too. We were floating in the cavern, like there was no gravity, but they didn't need it and moved freely in any direction. At one point I was running or fleeing from a group of them. Then after prodding from a few of them, I set thousands of other demons on fire that were surrounding my small group, using my mind.

I have no idea what to make of the dream/nightmare. It was definitely very unsettling.
