 Best Juri I've ever seen. No wonder he annihilated Daigo at Evo. [](/Kreygasm)  









 Am I the only person that gets really disturbed and creeped out when Daigo is just casually smiling in a high-pressure situation match? 




 That match took like 2 minutes WTF 




 Aiai is one of the best Juri players in Japan. 




 Luffy is gone now. Itabashi Zangief really has his number. He beat him at Dreamhack Winter 2014 too. 




 Itabashi Zangief eliminates Luffy 2-0. Cya Evo Champ! 




 I mentioned "phone" not "phones" mate 




 If Australia are losing wickets at this rate, I would be pissed if Steven Smith gets stranded before reaching his double century.
