 Cheapest ribeye at my local grocer is $11.99/lb  




 I bet it would taste like a piece of jerky too 




 Oh I'm not actually going to buy it haha

 those peppers on the diablo are hot!  




 Haha but then... Never mind

 Sushi for sure 




 Did you find the keto to hinder your endurance training at all? I'm a cyclist and I noticed the lack of carbs to affect my endurance riding
