 There's actually a mod to THUG2 called THUGPRO that's takes all the levels from thug1 and 2, thps4, thaw, and more. The community is growing. Check it out! Just Google it.  




 Thank you to the team for making this! I am reliving a huge part of my first gaming experiences. I hope the community builds again!  




 I remember Create-a-review. That's was the place for the community! I remember hanging out with the Tho guys. Tek was really cool.  




 Just some beautiful animation there. I love how Quagmire just stands there stone faced, unblinking. There's so much liveliness in the characters, especially if you remove Peters mouth. Walt Disney would be proud.
