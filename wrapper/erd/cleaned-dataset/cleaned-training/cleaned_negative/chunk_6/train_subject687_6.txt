 I wish I were you. 









 Not many people join my subreddits, despite the cool CSS... and I'm like the only one who posts. Is there a way to put my subreddits more out there? 




 I am sunk in the depths of failure, as of now. 




 Happy? Sad? Thinking about telling your crush something? Feeling accomplished? Feeling failure? Excited? Worried? Not much really?

 Proof? 




 Nope... 




 Yeah... the eye in real life is actually the eye of a calf. 




 Dude, you're lucky. She most likely likes you and is just very nervous when near you. The best thing to do next time you see her is to go up to her and be like "Hey, whatsup..." 




 Yes, this is very true. 




 Similar situation... except that we met about 4 months ago, but we've only seen each other like 5 times because we have no classes together and the school is huge...  














 ooooo spooky... 









 I wonder why :( 




 It's not a single bot... it's like thousands of bots, but Dairelldz is the main one. 




 Doot Doot 




 Nah... it's just natural. 




 Oh... 




 I'm gonna check it out! 









 This is calming... more than I initially expected... ahhh 




 If only you had waited just a bit longer :'( 




 Sulfur 




 It probably is.... 





























 It's unknown yet... we're trying to somehow decode the codes.

 I don't know... I wonder that too 




 D: 









 I know, I feel that emptiness too. 




 Even after trying many different decoders, I can't crack it! I've been using this:

http://encoders-decoders.online-domain-tools.com/

But I better take a rest from this frustration for now. 




 MAJOR DISCOVERY: The bloody-eyed Snoo is gone!!! 




 I noticed that phase 1 has been failed D:  Also there's a countdown... probably the time we have left to complete the phase. 




 Because it is getting to more and more websites. Each website it gets to, it "conquers" and takes down. It will probably end up taking down the whole internet.... 




 Time to delete my account. 



















 This is so frustrating }:| 




 Trash 




 Hope the world won't end. 




 Anything. 




 Stab my knee-cap.
