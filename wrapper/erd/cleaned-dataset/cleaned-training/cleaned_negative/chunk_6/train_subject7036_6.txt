 I know! Check [this](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-02/26/spotify-axes-apps) article. Looks like the apps took away from actually listening and discovering music aside from a few key players. Musixmatch was so popular they just integrated it.  




 Soundrop has been removed from Spotify as have most 3rd party apps. We used to use Soundrop at work but have not been able to since they decided to do away with 3rd party apps. Will have to look into plug.dj! 




 Yea ive been using their activity feed for a while and it's great. I'm hoping they make this live. For example: a listen with button or something of the like. Then you really are listening along with friends or artists. Totally at their discretion 




 Next level social-music listening experience. I would love to see this happen.  














 We give it all a power scrub after each brew.

 I am blown away every time I dry my hands in a bathroom with a Dyson Air Blade. I want to know how you came up with this restroom marvel of the 21th century. Thank you! Here are my questions.

1. How did you come up with the idea for the Dyson Air-Blade?

2. Who did you tell first about the idea to affirm your desires for a superior hand dryer and how did they react to learning that you wanted to make something that blows air out instead of being sucked in?

3. Do you think your invention has revolutionized modern bathrooms across the globe and if so, how?

4. Have you ever left a restroom using your own invention saying to yourself "Wow! My hands are so dry and that was fucking fun" just like we all do when we use your product?

5. What is your favorite type of chicken wing sauce?

 Nice purchase! I have Caress of Steel and a signed copy of Grace Under Pressure. They are my favorite band! 




 The [chair](http://i.imgur.com/s5xdy7o.jpg) is as deadly comfortable as a real Zebra-Leopard would be in real life.  




 Thank you kindly! Those have since been moved to the other side of my room and leaned between bookends neatly. Many of my new additions are from my dads college collection. 

The table is great, I love it. Got it on sale at home goods. Very sturdy.

For Under 500 USD you can get your music room similarly set up. It really is very solid IMO! If I had my way I would have gotten better speakers but as long as you have music and a comfy chair (my great grandfathers leopard colored-zebra patterned is what I use) you are golden! 
 














 perhaps but I feel that some genres still command a core following; a certain type of 'stereotypical' listener. Or it might just mean that music is more accessible and due to this people are listening to all different genres rather because they are all so easy to find. The internet is a global musical-ecosystem where all of these genres are floating around and is easy to access by all types of people. In contrast before the internet, it was much harder to find different types of music outside of what your community's radios were playing. That was why your spectrum of choice was mostly influenced by the radio and perpetuated to the other people around them and down the line to kids etc etc.  




 Love Streetlight Manifesto. Huge into jazz also. I work for a company who work with tons of metal artists and when I hear about all the subgenres I cant begin to wrap my head around it. Huge appreciation for the musicians but I just cant seem to get into the music. I do like Meshuggah though. I also love some Girls Day. (K-Pop) 




 I love Enya. In grade school I had [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTrk4X9ACtw) on repeat. Prob gunna listen to all of her stuff again now. Thanks
 




 all of my friends had a Sublime phase. I never had one. Nothing against them. It just was never really introduced to me 




 speaking of which, [footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ7qgrOyKQ8) from the pit is amazing. I am a trumpet player so I eat this stuff up. This bass trombone at the end is dirtyyyy 




 in every sense 




 As someone who is into both hip hop and system of a down I see nothing wrong with this! 




 I sang along to wicked last week.
