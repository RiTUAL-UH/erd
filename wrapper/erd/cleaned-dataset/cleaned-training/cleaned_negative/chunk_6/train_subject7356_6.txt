 Thankyou so much for your message. I want to stay with him, we have been together for three years and I want to be there for him. But it's confusing me when he acts happy and seems perfectly OK and himself, and then treats me poorly (forgetting our anniversary, not being there for me through things, not seeing me often). I am associating his bad behaviour with what he is going through, but then he doesn't seem any different and I'm finding it difficult.
