 Yea that's the point I've reached after biting it for the 30th time during breakfast this morning. 









 This actually made me lol  









 In a 400 level electrical engineering course:

*Awkward guy in class raises hand in the middle of the lecture*

Guy: Whats a derivative?"
Professor: You're telling me that you're getting ready to graduate with an engineering degree and you don't know what a derivative is?"
Guy:Well I know what it is"
Professor:Well then explain it"
Guy: ............."

*Class busts out laughing and the teacher goes back to teaching* 




 In a college algebra class as we're discussing inequalities:

Girl: Wait, why are there letters and where's the equal sign?"
*Class gets awkwardly silent and the teacher stares at her for a good 10 seconds in silence*
Teacher: The letters are variables or numbers we dont know yet and there's  no equal sign because this is an inequalitity"
Girl: If there's no equal sign then you can't do anything"
*professor turns back around and goes back to teaching

She dropped the class the next day 




 No, Maryland 









 A little back information: my Dad and Grandma were notorious for playing pranks on each other when they'd visit each other, putting stuff on each other's face while they slept, my dad hid a full bag of trash in her car when she went on a trip back home, etc. Well it was Christmas in like '97-'98(I was about 9) and we had received a package from Grandma and were supposed to open it on Christmas Eve. We open it to see a bunch of what look like gourmet chocolates, so we all enjoy the evening and each the chocolates without anyone noticing. We get a call from our family who lives near my Grandma and they're just laughing it up and barking throughout the entire conversation, come to find out that she ate all the actual chcolates and dipped dog food bits in chocolate and repackaged the box. Come to find out, apparently chocolate covered dog food isn't that bad tasting.
