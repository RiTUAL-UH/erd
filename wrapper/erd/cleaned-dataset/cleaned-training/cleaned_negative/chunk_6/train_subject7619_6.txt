 But if you do, it's cool. I mean, it's annoying, but it's not like we'll cut your head off or anything. 









 Perfect! 




 Interesting. I think it reminds me too much of old school Titans. I kind of liked the bulky look, but maybe they're trying to create some visual distinction so he doesn't resemble something like Marvel's War Machine. 




 When did Cyborg shrink? [He was huge](http://i.newsarama.com/images/i/000/102/537/original/cyborg_03.jpg) before. 




 It's both. 




 LOL! SO FUNNY! EVEN THOUGH THOSE JOKES HAVE APPEARED 52 MILLION TIMES ON THIS SUBREDDIT I LAUGH EVERY TIME! 




 And a [4chan green text](http://i.imgur.com/H39tuWI.png) long before that. 




 This is a classic Reddit trope I see all the time. I swear this website has to be made up of some of the most socially retarded people on the planet. /r/tifu is full of this shit. One slightly socially awkward blunder and it's like the Armageddon. 




 It's also kind of a less funny version of [this classic 4chan green text.](http://i.imgur.com/H39tuWI.png) 




 If you think you're going to change the mind of a conpiratard with facts, I have bad news for you. 




 For me it's the fact. This is literally just a quote from a book that anyone would know if they read the book, and, last I checked, it's pretty much on every school reading list. 

You might as well post TIL we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. 

Subscribing doesn't do much for me if 90% I'm just rolling my eyes and muttering "no shit" to myself. 




 The point is, as soon as the animated white-out eyes start moving/expressing motion, they will appear animated, fake, cartoony, and silly. For Deadpool, that will work wonders and fit the character perfectly. For Batman, a more grounded and realistic character in more grounded and realistic movies, it work against the look, feel, and tone of both the character and the movies. 




  Who's to say it has to be goofy and cartoony?

Because that is exactly what is going to happen when you try to apply a cartoon/animated feature to a live action person.

[Picture this](http://media.giphy.com/media/14iEFCXZcJmfXq/giphy.gif) on a real actor. 









 You'd either have white-out eyes that don't move and don't express emotion, which no filmmaker or actor would want, or you'd have animated white out eyes which would be goofy and cartoony. Either way, not appropriate for any remotely serious Batman movie.

Again, Deadpool and Batman are very different animals. 




 It's not an issue of money. Of course Nolan and others have had the budget to white out the eyes; they don't want to for reasons posted throughout this thread, but mostly because the filmmakers want you to see the actor's real eyes. 

Also, because Batman is a more grounded, realistic comic book character compared to Deadpool, they took a more grounded, realistic approach to the look. The white, animated, expressive eyes in the Deadpool movie will look cartoony, and for Deadpool, that's perfect. For Batman, it would be laughable. 

Now I can't stop thinking of Batman: The Animated Series and the [infamous squint.](http://media.giphy.com/media/14iEFCXZcJmfXq/giphy.gif)  




  because they are among the best comic book movies of all-time

As long as we're not including Rises in that phrase, I agree completely. 




 I like both for different reasons. 




 That *was* true, which is why the current comics Batman does (and has for a while now) rocked an all black (actually shades of gray) costume. Inks and paper have improved vastly since. People tend to forget that comics character's [black hair was blue](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114711/3191617-9264010257-bruce.jpg) as well. Is anyone demanding "comics accurate" blue haired Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent?

The Spider-Man villain [Venom was depicted as blue](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/156-VenomSBHImage_1135.jpg) even though he was blatantly referred to as being all black in the comics.  




 That's an in-universe explanation that only appeared in Miller's non-canonical Dark Knight Returns. The truth is that it was that way specifically for trademark reasons. Once they were able to get around that, they restored the oval-less chest emblem. 




 Whole different animal. His white eyes in the comics and in the movies are animated and expressive, part of his cartoon qualities. 




 Too true. Aquaman can swim at 10,000 feet per second. 10,000 feet per second is more than 3 kilometers per second, or 6,800 miles per hour. 

For comparison, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps can sustain a speed of 4.7 miles per hour. 




 Coupled with invincible plot armor makes him every bit as powerful as Superman.

Popularity is a hell of a power. 




 The Ultimate Nullifier is almost a literal deus ex machina. 




 But *they* didn't give him claws. He was born a mutant with claws. This goes back quite a ways. Even when Magneto ripped the adamantium out of him he had bone claws. 




 That's a really good point. At the time of Justice League's beginning, the concept of creating a superhero team didn't even exist. 




 It's cool you like Superman, but are you going to kick Strawman's ass all day? You're literally arguing with no one. I never said a good writer couldn't write a team of Kyptonians on earth. I never said a good Justice League story couldn't be written with or without Superman, so you're arguing with an imaginary friend.

As for downvotes, I rarely use the button. I'm not the only man on Reddit. 




 The dynamic of their powers works because there's variety; the writing makes the story work.

Do I really have to spell this out? I'm talking about one aspect specifically. Superman's presence on a team is like having God with a team of lesser gods who each get maybe one or two of God's powers. It's redundant. That's the only point I was making. 




 Yes, because I'm pointing out the redundancy of Superman's powers with those of his teammates I must be completely failing to grasp every Justice League story that has ever been written. You nailed it. 




 So I've bounced around working here or there, and I don't know how it is people amass these portfolios. Any work I did for various printers and ad agencies was considered theirs. I didn't get a copy. Should I have? Now I'm looking for work and suddenly everyone asking for a portfolio. I don't have one besides the one I needed to graduate with ten years ago, which doesn't really reflect my talents now. Should I just invent stuff? I feel like I missed a vital lecture/class that everyone else in the industry attended. I feel quite stupid and lost. Any advice? 




  the whole idea of Speedforce is that it's in every univers

In every *DC Universe*, which is already novel considering there are some pretty significant differences between the various universes within the DC universe alone. You don't need to explain that anymore than you'd have to explain there not being a Phoenix Force, Captain Universe, or Power Cosmic in the DC Universe. What's true in one isn't necessarily true in another. 




  Clearly DC and Marvel are in some kind of agreement in that scenario

Yes, and they agree, per DC Comics copyright and interests, that "Speed Force" is a unique property of DC Comics and does not/can not exist in the Marvel Universe, just as the Infinity Gauntlet proved useless to Darkseid in the DC Universe. 




 DC Comics doesn't get to decide what does and doesn't exist in other companies' multiverses. 




 I'm actually sick to death of Batgod. A man who is fallible and isn't the be-all/end-all answer to every conceivable question is a lot more interesting.

I don't even have a problem with "world's greatest detective" and best martial artist in the DCU, but does he have to perfect in every way? It's always either that he knows everything and is the world's leading expert, but in the rare case he isn't, he will be by the time you come back with coffee. 




 That's kind of my problem with Superman and the Justice League. The X-Men work because they're a team with a variety of powers. Yes, some are more powerful than others, but there aren't really much in the way of redundancies. 

Super strength? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct assistance), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, and the Flash (infinite mass punch anyone?). 

Flight? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter. 

Neigh-invulnerable? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct shielding), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter (more likely density shifts through it, but he's still physically tough), etc.

Super Speed? Superman and The Flash, although Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman are able to get to wherever they need to go quickly, including across vast expanses of space.

Justice League *with* Superman just seems kind of redundant. Superman is a one-man superhero team. 




 Yeah, but not in seven or eight months. I'd say there's a good chance of a lot of people seeing this for the first time.

 Okay, but his accepted origin story now across multiple media is that he always had claws, and even before that, the Weapon X program lacing his bones with adamantium isn't the same as saying he has claws due to his healing factor. That doesn't make sense. 




 "Bad Hair Day" from a couple seasons back, season 4 episode 16. He played "Tater."

Tater: I was wondering who was the lucky man who married the beautiful Claire Pritchett.

Phil Dunphy: Luck had nothing to do with it. She saw, she liked, I got her pregnant, had to marry her.

US did the same thing back in the 1930s to stop the dust bowls: "After the howling winds passed and the dust settled, federal foresters planted 100 million trees across the Great Plains, forming a giant windbreak  known as a shelterbelt  that stretched from Texas to Canada."

Actually this project was started first in Algeria in the 70's. It's called the green dam.You can see it in this picture http://imgur.com/E140PYS

They used to take the kids from school from all over the country to plant trees there once a year. Drafted soldiers participated too. The forests exist to this day, I remember finding mushrooms under the trees. You can even spot animals like rabbits there.

EDIT: and it does work and the best economical way to do it is to have the community participate in planting the trees.

Love him or hate him, John cena makes kids wishes come true.

He legitimately cares about those kids.

I was at raw about a year ago, there was a kid there in a wheelchair in the crowd you could tell that he didn't jut break his leg. He was sitting pretty close and John cena threw his shirt, his hat, and I think his wristband things to this kid, everyone could tell it was for him and when someone near him caught it, cena would look at them and motion to pass it to the kid. Everyone did. It was really awesome.

The Foo Fighters wanted to release a cover of Prince's "Darling Nikki" on a b-side, Prince told them that they couldn't due to copyright, so instead they just played it at shows for a while in the early 2000s. In retaliation, Prince played a cover of "Best of You" at the 2006 Super Bowl. However, his revenge didn't work out as planned, as Dave Grohl was stoked to get covered by one of his musical idols.

TL;DR Prince is a pretty reliable copyright dick
 




 What's really amazing is that 50 out of 69 actually found that review helpful... 




  I think the film is cheap and vapid

You've got my attention. How so? 




 I would if it was the word I required, yes.

I'm really not getting all the fuss over my word choice. I never considered "modicum" such a highfalutin bit of vocabulary.  




 Fair enough. 




 Borderline pedantry, but when you're right you're right. Either way, you understand why I'd consider Momento a postmodernist film in that sense. 




 I have read and re-read the post that continuously gets the downvoting and it's far from pretentious. It sounds like you're saying I have to dumb down my comments in order for /r/movies not to have their intelligence insulted, which is actually *more* insulting to their intelligence.

A fellow commenter claimed this movie was postmodern. I disagreed politely and explained my reasoning. If that's something considered a "dick move" by the Reddit masses, so be it. Negative Reddit karma isn't going to keep me up at night.

And I'll keep "modicum." It's a lovely word when it's precisely what I mean. 




 Are there formal and informal versions of /r/movies? If not, what is it about /r/movies that demands exclusively informal speech? How is "modicum" even beyond informal speech? 

You're telling me /r/movies is no place for serious, academic, formal, or even relatively learned discussion about film? Then please, direct me to the subreddit that is, and please do so while remembering that it was not I who brought "postmodern" into the discussion. I'm just the one being crucified over daring to question it. 




 So glad you asked! I think Memento is postmodern in its depiction of life and memories. It supports the postmodern claim that truth is what we believe it to be, and memories are not reliable because we sometimes lie to ourselves, sometimes even unknowingly. The underlying idea is that 'real' truth does not exist. If postmodernism is, at its core, questioning the certainty of things, surely our own minds and the way we lie to ourselves is valid. 




 I aim to please. 




 Postmodernism *is* a vague category; it would be wholly ironic to try and define it with passionate certainty since that is exactly what postmodernism seeks to critique. That being said, I don't see it as a synonym for meta humor or any self-referential or self-aware comedy. That was the crux of my comment. I consider--as I suspect many do--that postmodernism carries deeper meaning than that. 

Obviously I haven't seen "A Deadly Adoption," but I would expect it to be like an hour-plus SNL sketch lampooning the Lifetime movie clich. If that's all it is, would you really categorize it as "postmodern?"

And let's say you would. Fuck me for having a contrary opinion? I have been under the impression that the point of these comments sections was for discussion. If everyone is going to just upvote everyone they agree with and comment the same thing worded differently, what's the point? 




 I'm glad I'm not alone. I've questioned the downvoting of some of my comments and posts, but this one left me truly baffled.

Of course, whenever one is dealing with the written word, there's what you write and then there's what people will read into it. 




 I write as I speak. What's wrong with modicum?  




 [Or zombie strippers.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0960890/) 




 It's a joke that you're taking seriously. 




 I quite like both ;) 




 Explain to me how any of that was the least bit pretentious, rude, or how it could sound "awful." 

*I tend to reserve*

As in me, my opinion. Not saying the other chap is wrong, but here's what works for me. 

I list a number of fantastic films that I consider prime examples of how I interpret postmodernism. What a dick. I mean really, who does that? /r/movies is for discussing movies, not... discussing... movies?

Finally, I simply state the definition of postmodernism from which I am working so that /u/I_AM_LOOKING_AT_YOU and others can understand where I'm coming from, and then I offer another potentially more accurate term for the aforementioned Lifetime movie.

There's nothing "pretentious" about my post. I politely disagreed with someone and explained exactly why. If that's pretentious, you'd have an awfully hard time having any conversation that isn't. 




 You'd think *someone* would have the initiative... 




 For the lazy:

Insofar as I may be heard by anything, which may or may not care what I say, I ask, if it matters, that you be forgiven for anything you may have done or failed to do which requires forgiveness. Conversely, if not forgiveness but something else may be required to ensure any possible benefit for which you may be eligible after the destruction of your body, I ask that this, whatever it may be, be granted or withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to insure your receiving said benefit. I ask this in my capacity as your elected intermediary between yourself and that which may not be yourself, but which may have an interest in the matter of your receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this thing, and which may in some way be influenced by this ceremony. Amen.

This is taken from *Creatures of Light and Darkness*, a 1969 science fiction novel by Roger Zelazny. 









 Not really; he just didn't remember. 




 That's what I figured. It's funny because I thought of the exact same thing when I saw this post. 




 Disagreeing politely and contributing meaningfully to the conversation = pretentious.

Ah, Reddit... 




 You're not wrong. I'd suggest the loosest definition would be skeptical or critical works of their own time/genre/artform in the wake of modernism. 

 




 Makes a lot more sense than they're all right. 




 Only if said wrestling involves [zombies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UaY4idyLww). 




 I forgot that this is Reddit, where contributing to a conversation with a modicum of intelligence is considered "pretentious."

Next time I'll just comment "this." 




 I don't get Reddit sometimes. All I did was explain why /u/seven3true is correct in that celery can be considered less calories than listed. Why would anyone downvote that?

 Correct.

Kind of.

[Sauce](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/myth-or-fact-celery-has-negative-calories.html) 




 Yes, but celery has "negative calories." 

As a plant, celery stores its calories throughout its body, just as every other plant does. There are plenty of food calories in celery; the difference is that humans cannot adequately process those calories.

The majority of energy that celery has locked within it passes through our digestive system without being processed. The cellulose calories celery has is irrelevant; all that counts is the six or so food calories we can get from each eight-inch stalk. Since it takes more than six food calories of energy to digest the celery, the net result is that digesting celery does, in fact, exhaust calories. In a very real sense, celery is a "negative calorie" food. 




 Of course. 




 That's not odd; it's logic. 




  I'd love to see their list

You mean the PDF I posted to make this TIL?

Also, in the introduction of the Wikipedia link you just provided:

***This is not a complete list***

That's basically the opposite of "comprehensive." 




 Brilliant. 














 Right, because it's an unpopular opinion that gets downvoted like crazy. I don't find most of these particularly funny or creative either.

Now let's see what happens to my comment. 




 I went to Castaway Cay for my honeymoon. I was very tempted to hide and not get back on the cruise ship. 




 Well, I'm sorry you lost a friend but I'm very happy to read that you and your boyfriend are still going strong. Congratulations. 




 Aw... happy for you and your guy. 




  Well, only because you are just thinking about sex

I'm really not. True, I'm not sexually attracted to men and definitely don't want sex with a man, but more importantly, I don't fall romantically in love with men. I have two or three male friends whom I love, but it's a brotherly love, not a romantic or sexual love. I can't see that working in a relationship, even if he could fix my car for free, which would be amazing...

I like your analogies, though. Definitely laughed out loud at "your balls small funny." 




 That's a fascinating story. So you and your boyfriend (the original) are still together and totally "survived" the experience?

Also, CJ happens to me *my* initials... freaky. 




 Haterade is too sour for my taste buds. 




  Be a man, break it off, don't cheat.

Been saying this forever bro. 




 If you consider pedophilia and incest fucked up, yes. Yes it is. 









 Your user name plus dropping an Alan Moore reference to explain things means we're friends now. 




 That would be no different that straight people cheating then. I'm talking about 3, 4, or even more in a loving, committed relationship, kind of like polygamy, but that's almost always one man and like a dozen women, and the women are all for the one guy.  




 I legitimately had a hard time with Ratatouille for that very reason. For some reason, I could easily suspend my disbelief for the talking rat that can cook and whatnot, but controlling a man by his hair? Preposterous! 




 Seriously. The word "misdemeanor" doesn't even appear in the article, probably because it's not a relevant term in this context.

I guess "results in relatively lighter punitive measures" wasn't eye-catching enough. 




  No, there is not much evidence to back up this idea.

Or Freud in general, but he *is* a fun read.

 A grenade thrown into a kitchen in France would result in linoleum blown apart.

"Linoleum blown apart" is a pun on the name "Napoleon Bonaparte," one of France's most famous historical figures. 




 DAE think a young Philip Seymour Hoffman (as seen in OP's L O clip) would have made a phenomenal Foggy Nelson (of Daredevil fame)?

Then again, Philip Seymour Hoffman would make a phenomenal lots of things... 




  So in this instance, the damage is done and his daughter is going to grow up to be a serial killer, am I right, or am I right? ;)

If so, as the proud father of a little girl myself, I only hope his doesn't kill mine ;)

 I appreciate your civility and lack of defenciveness, but it's more than an opinion; it's an opinion based on quite a lot of research. 




  I believe that exposure to hyper-realistic violence in a controlled enviroment is a practical approach to parenting

Can you read that again and tell me you're actually being serious?

A four-year-old has no ability whatsoever to comprehend what he or she is seeing. Why would you show them at that young and impressionable age where they're still trying to make sense of the world people intentionally and purposefully doing wanton violence to one another? That's the impression you'd want a young child to have of the world? Just dash their innocence against the rocks right off the bat?

As for citing a source, I don't know how to narrow it down from [these 386,000](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=exposure+to+media+violence+children hl=en as_sdt=0 as_vis=1 oi=scholart sa=X ei=wlFsVYzBGMaagwTQtoP4CA ved=0CBwQgQMwAA), but feel free to pick the first three you like and peruse.

Here's a quote from the [first one](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-23323-000): Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley describe the reaction of the games industry to scientific findings that exposure to violent video games and other forms of media violence constitutes a significant risk factor for later aggressive and violent behavior.

Here's a more [recent one from 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285914003325): Child-reported media violence exposure was associated with physical aggression after multivariable adjustment for sociodemographics, family and community violence, and child mental health symptoms (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.17; video games, 0.15; music, 0.14). This association was significant and independent for television, video games, and music violence exposure in a model including all 3 media types (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.11; video games, 0.09; music, 0.09). There was a significant positive interaction between media time and media violence for video games and music but not for television. Effect sizes for the association of media violence exposure and physical aggression were greater in magnitude than for most of the other examined variables.

Here's another [recent study](http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/03/09/scan.nsv025.abstract): Media violence exposure causes increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior, suggesting that media violence desensitizes people to the emotional experience of others.

This really shouldn't surprise anybody. 




  The notion that hyper-realistic violence should not be exposed to children is utterly arbitrary

Not according to the many, MANY studies done on the subject, and your anecdote is meaningless; anecdotes are not evidence.

There are hundreds of thousands of studies I could link to supporting what I'm saying: a young child, a four-year-old, should *not* be exposed to the kind of violence depicted in Mortal Kombat.

Like I said, I'll take the downvotes, because fuck me for caring more about the welfare of children than... what? I don't even know why this warrants downvoting. I've been a fan of Mortal Kombat since the original hit arcades in 1992. I was eleven at the time. I've owned the home console version of all of them including X, but I don't play them in front of my now 5-year-old daughter because it would be grossly irresponsible bad parenting. 




  I doubt OP does fatalities/x-rays while his daughter is watching

What are you basing that doubt on? Even if OP doesn't, there's nothing stopping the opponent from doing it.

Besides, this is MK9 we're talking about. The regular gameplay and even backgrounds are graphically violent. 




 I don't care if I get downvoted for this; a four-year-old girl should not be exposed that kind of violence.  




 Great advice. Thank you. 




 As I said in my original post, it's all about convenience. There are currently about 20-30 bottles of delicious water in my refrigerator at about 34 degrees F that I can grab and drink at my leisure. The containers are also convenient, because even if I'm on the go, I can crush them down to almost nothing and screw on the cap. They fit right in my pocket until I can find a proper receptacle. 

So, back to my original point, I use bottled water for the same reason I use floss picks rather than spool floss. Convenience is king. 




 There are lots of reasons including [breakdown on the plastics](http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/clinical/departments/medicine/divisions/digestive-health/clinical-care/nutrition-support-team/nutrition-articles/LeisingArticle.pdf) by reuse and the fact that the bottles turn into [bacteria parties.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12353459) 




 Seriously, people are buying this? 




  the floss picks are the only thing keeping daily flossing convenient enough to actually do

Same rationale I use when buying packs of bottled water. I know I'm supposed to drink water rather than soda, juice, etc., but without the convenience of the bottles and the awesome coldness of the refrigerator, I know I won't. 




 Yeah, as a parent of a five-year-old girl, I would not be comfortable with her seeing this. 




 Which is amazing when you consider how hilariously tame it looks next to something like MKX. 




 I don't even consider it "soft" atheism. Atheism is just a-theism, i.e., without theism. I'm irreligious and I don't believe in god. That's what an atheist actually is, regardless of how many people try to define it on their own terms or make ridiculous line graphs. 

In other words, I'm not making any extraordinary claims. In spite of tons of reading, research, and opening myself up to many ideas, I see no evidence supporting the existence of god, nor do I see the need for one. I stop short of saying there is no god because that's impossible for me or anyone else to say meaningfully. There's no proof either way. 

God either exists and it's wrong to say god doesn't exist, or god doesn't exist and it's impossible to prove a negative. I can't prove pink unicorns that eat rainbows and shit butterflies *don't* exist, but it's perfectly reasonable for me to not believe in them.

Therefore, rationally, "I don't believe in god" is the only sensible statement. 




 Meh. It's not as if I have to re-read it. 




 If every bullshit post were appropriately downvoted, there'd scarcely be a Reddit left. 




 Seriously. I'm 34. I cannot convey to today's teenagers and young adults how outrageous it was to see this in the arcades back in 1992. Minds were absolutely blown. A new ratings system was introduced because of this. People lost all their shit. All of it. 




 Character is unique by being completely black.

"Hey guys! I got a great animal for Noob Saibot! A black panther!"

"Anteater, yo."

"But-"

"Bro. Anteater."

"But he's-"

"Ant... eater."

"Sigh. K." 




 I can't even discuss Transmetropolitan because I start physically shaking with joy. It's that damned good. 




 Warren Ellis is easily one of my favorite comic book writers ever. His run on The Authority was brilliant. 




 I didn't fail to grasp anything. Either is wrong. You're making a statement of fact about something that cannot be proven. It makes no more sense to say God or gods exist than it does to say God or gods don't exist. 

The sensible thing to say is either "I don't believe in god" or "I don't believe in gods." 

It also doesn't matter which one you say as "god," singular, would stand in for any god; it doesn't matter how many there are. 




 Neither is correct. 

Atheists don't believe in god, but in the same way that there is no evidence for god, one cannot disprove a negative. While I certainly don't believe in gods or anything else without proof, I nor anyone else can claim with 100% certainty that an improvable thing doesn't exist. That is logically impossible.

That being said, one should rationally say "I do not believe in god" rather than making any factual statement that they do not exist or cannot exist.

Taking that to OP's point, there is a semantic difference between "I don't believe in god" and "I don't believe in God." The capitalized "God" is a specific one, and, in the United States, most often assumed to mean the Abrahamic God, an even more specifically, the Christian trinity god based on demographics. An lower-case "god" could refer generically to any god, goddess, or similar deity and is therefore a perfectly reasonable substitute. You don't need to pluralize "gods" any more than you'd need to say, "I don't believe in God, god, gods, goddesses, or deities of any kind."  




 We can all read. Your post is 

"There is no God" is incorrect. "There are no gods" is the proper term. 

You're saying one is incorrect and the other is correct.

Not only are you wrong, but you're telling everyone *they're* wrong just because you have an opinion.

  Rajnikanth, chuck norris of INDIA

You've insulted Rajnikanth. For your sake, I hope he shows you a modicum of mercy. 




 This. They never quantify the number of combatants in the song. Dude could've walked into a room in which 2, 3, 4, or whatever small number of people are fighting in the martial arts style of Kung Fu. 

This isn't rocket surgery. 




 I mean, the man *is* a doctor... 




 Excellent point.  




 Fascinating. 




 "This sub" doesn't hate anything or love anything; its subscribers have a variety of opinions.

I personally hated The Widening Gyre and pretty much anything else Kevin Smith does. That's *my* opinion and probably relatively uncommon to that of most of /r/DCcomics subscribers.

As for Gotham, I never tried so hard to like something and still managed to come up so short. It had its moments, but overall, a huge disappointment. 

As for Endgame, I haven't read it yet. 




 [Harley seems to think so.](http://i.imgur.com/wlqTTNe.jpg) 




 Specifically, Whoville is on a *speck*. Horton puts the speck on a flower. Grinch could take place many years after and the speck has come to rest on a snowflake. The first few pages of Horton establish that, prior to Horton, the speck was just floating around.

If you like Kevin Smith, he's actually written a few comics including for Daredevil and Batman. 




  I always thought of the grinch as a recluse Who who was pushed out of the town by the other who's because of his appearance.

Maybe he is, but it never suggests that in the book.

 Quiver, Kevin Smith. 




 Because Kevin Smith.

"The package says 'He-Man.'"

"Arm Fall Off Boy!" 




 I couldn't agree more. I like Batman dark as the night itself. It doesn't make sense to have a bright yellow belt when the idea is to be stealthy. Brown, tan, or even black leather would make plenty of sense. 




 They eat fat? 




 Egregiously so. Has any limit to his power been established? The kid literally alters realities and has even created new ones, wiped people's minds, and traveled between dimensions. What *can't* he do? 




 Mine is left out on the counter by the sink, so definitely don't use that, right? 




  You can also take all of your fats and mix them with sodium or potassium hydroxide (you can get this online) to make soap. 

I'd have a hard time feeling clean after rubbing animal fat all over my body.

 He doesn't grow new ones; they just detach and reattach.

He can use his arm as a blunt weapon and swing it like a club, but aside from a few novelty uses, it's not a very useful power.

  the grinch is still a Who as well

Is he?

  I know where you can begin, reading comprehension courses.

Really? Because here's what you *actually* wrote:

Exactly, making Sue black would have been a lot less confusing. Some people don't seem to get that it has nothing to do with race and everything to do with fucking with the character's for what seems like no other reason than to be "edgy".

making Sue black would have been a lot less confusing

How is making Sue black *less* confusing? The only way her not being black could be construed as confusing is if you didn't grasp the incredibly simple concept of adoption or step siblings. This isn't hard.

fucking with the character's for what seems like no other reason than to be "edgy"

The only "fucking with the characters" (no apostrophe needed there) the filmmaker has done was to make Johnny Storm black, so that's you thinking black = "edgy."

I'm not the one in need of reading comprehension courses. If anyone needs an education here, it's you.

 My theory is going primarily by the books. I didn't know The Grinch shows up in the Horton Hears a Who! movie, nor was I aware of Seussical.

EDIT 1: Which movie version of Horton Hears a Who! did the Grinch appear in? There are two.

EDIT 2: Actually, I have to insist this theory sticks to the books only as there have been two Horton movies and two Grinch movies. The movies contradict themselves and it cannot be sensibly said that one is canon while the other is not. This is strictly a book theory. 




  Jesus was born in the spring, and they moved the celebration day to coincide with the winter solstice

The Gospel of Luke references shepherds grazing their sheep in the fields implying a birth during the springtime, summer or early fall, so yeah, more or less. Your point stands.
