 Thanks for the love! Yes, I'll most likely return to the series, or at least the CONCEPT of the series at some point in time. 




 I would absolutely be interested in approaching that subject, but probably not from a novella standpoint. I think things would be very, very different overseas for various geopolitical reasons, so I think broaching that story would take a little more than a novella. But it's definitely something I've thought about! 




 Definitely something else. For now.

My book that's being shopped right now (Wolves) is post-apocalyptic, but that's really more of just the setting of the story, and not necessarily the story itself.

The book I'm writing right now is...dystopian. And has to do with revolution, which is a touchy subject. But I'm having fun.

Well, the rights are taken. We'll just have to cross our fingers and see what happens!
