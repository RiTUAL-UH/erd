 Regardless of what happened. When someone pulls a gun on you and does not seem to be an imminent threat, you DO NOT argue with them no matter how wrong you think they are. Someone pulling a gun like that in a situation like this probably isn't too stable, and the best thing to do is to move along and call the police. 




 Just about anybody that improves their diet, sleep and health habits will likely see both physical and mental improvements. 

This study seems a bit odd. Reported results were subjective, and there is nothing substantiating that the patients were not still at a major cognitive deficit. It seems to me it is less about 'reversing' Alzheimer's losses and more about reducing the number of other factors that lead to cognitive impairment (like stress, sleep deprivation, malnutrition, etc etc). 

 




 I have a neuromuscular disorder that causes severe pain and this is the way things are for me. I'm still quite young, but I don't feel things like I should because the background pain masks it. Somehow I recently got a gigantic bruise/abrasion on my leg that covered my whole thigh, but I have no idea when or how it happened because the pain never broke through the existing pain. It sucks. 









 There is a certain type of bot that is 100% indistinguishable from a human user when using Reddit. They cannot be feasibly detected outside of requiring non-software-trivial manual intervention (like captchas) on the part of the users of Reddit. Even then the captchas can be farmed out to real users for solving.

It's Reddit's Achilles heel. Such bots could network together or use embedded upvote/downvote logic to wreak havoc on Reddit. The "solution" would likely involve invasive captcha style validations paired with two factor authentication, but as a solution it also ruins Reddit simplicity in other ways. 




 Lakes like this can be so freaky and misleading when it comes to depth. I remember going to a clear alpine lake like this when I was a kid. Being a kid I had a little toy boat and had it attached to kite string so I could put it on the water and have it blow out towards the middle of the lake.

It only sank once, and it wasn't very far from the shore, out where I expected I could wade out and get it. But as I watched the crystal clear waters it kept sinking, and sinking... and sinking.  I watched it sink probably 15 feet all the way to the bottom. From the shore it looked like the water would only be a few feet deep. Nope nope nope nope. 









 Localized in the sense that it was not an organized group perpetrating the attack.
 
The Canadian attack was considered terrorism related because it was an attack against the government, and the ideology behind it was driven by a call from ISIS for lone wolf attacks against governments. It was not a hate crime.

The Australian attack was similar, and was directed towards the general public of a country labeled an enemy by ISIS. In that case too the man behind the attack was driven by ISIS, and even had victims hold up an Islamic State flag.
 




 Because it appears to be a localized hate crime. This should no more be considered a terrorist attack than if an atheist black man shot three white Christians because of their religion and race.

It's tragic, it's terrible, but labeling it a terrorist attack seems unfounded. Even if the races were reversed. 




 Windows Intune is for managing existing Windows systems in a centralized fashion. It is not a new form of Windows client or an "online version" of Windows. 
























 Not to my knowledge in terms of significant dietary methods, but I'm not too up to speed on that. I do know lots of supplements claim things that really haven't been substantiated well by evidence.

You can use coffee to get a small boost.

I think the best advice is to eat healthy and to stay active. 

 




 The news sources seem to have quieted down now and French TV stations are mostly back to original programming. I don't think this is a terrorist attack. Police at the scene also appear to be all to calm and not in defensive positions that would be expected if it were terrorism related. 









 At least he's honest. 




 Seeing those Japanese soldiers roaming the streets must have been absolutely terrifying to civilians. They look like invaders from another planet. 




 The West Coast doesn't even feel like it's part of the same world anymore. Over here for most of the region it's felt like spring/summer for over a month now. We're breaking heat records and many of the sky resorts are bare. It's hard to imagine the other side of the country is on the opposite side of the spectrum and in the dead of winter. 




 ELI5: Your body controls your desire to do things. But you have the ability to influence your body with your actions. By doing activities you enjoy and playing outside you may feel happier and more motivated to do the things you don't enjoy.

Better? =) 




 Cocaine and other stimulants work very well in increasing dopamine levels for a short while, but long term they will wreak havoc on the dopamine related systems (and others)... especially when you try to quit and your body is still expecting very high levels of dopamine (but has suppressed more natural production due to previous excesses).

I would definitely not recommend it. 




 It's due to levels of neurotransmitters in your brain changing due to large variety of physiological, environmental, and emotional factors. There are likely a lot of neurotransmitters in play that have a huge impact on motivation, but currently the most well-known is one called "Dopamine". 

People who have disorders involving dopamine regulation dysfunction (such as Parkinson's, some forms of Depression, MS, etc) have severe disruption in motivation. The lower the dopamine production/uptake, the lower the motivation. They lack what would be considered a normal motivation drive, and typically see improvements in this motivation when undergoing pharmaceutical therapy to increase levels of dopamine.

So what can you do to influence dopamine? Well, the field is still very young and is full of unknowns, but it seems that one way to increase dopamine in healthy individuals is to have them partake in activities they **enjoy**. Exercise also has an effect on dopamine levels and as a result may increase levels of motivation. 

So if you're feeling unmotivated, perhaps it'd be wise to spend some time among friends or go for a quick jog/walk/bike ride before returning to your work. It could have a very positive impact. 




 If we're talking about a legit murder weapon, then I'd have to go with the poison dart frog. It's silent, it's deadly, it's small, and it'd be hard if not impossible to trace. 




 Things are not so black and white (no pun intended). There are a lot of factors in play here, like how statistically blacks are more likely than whites to be living in a poor neighborhood. Living in a poor neighborhood usually means more police patrols, which means more arrests.

The title is FUBAR.  




 Do they though? Most of the people I know with BMWs are either young professionals or older individuals and take care of their vehicles. I see people beat the crap out of Audis a lot, but it's rare for me to see someone treating their BMW in any way that could significantly affect its future reliability. 




 Ah... Somebody has been using a clay bar =)

 









 I would be surprised if they weren't. My friend who's a mechanic says people give both Audi's and BMWs too much credit for reliability. Apparently they have a lot more problems than most other brands, but the difference is that the owners are usually wealthy and can afford to fix them 




 Are GameStop's really doing that bad financially? I live in a big city, but all the GameStop's in my area are usually pretty busy. 









 I'm curious to know if they continued followup of the rats after 10 weeks? I would guess not, as they were likely dissected. Prolific cancer seems to be one of the biggest hurdles/side effects of current experimental stem cell therapy. Is 10 weeks long enough to say the treatment did not cause cancer? 




 I would hope so for those that have little chance of coming out of it (like those facing medical issues or those who have lost all that is around them). I'd be curious as to whether addicts could use this as well... So many of them have zero hope and are essentially already taking their own lives in a slow manner that other people pay for...

In practice however I doubt there will be any approval for anything but terminal illnesses or those which are progressive and do not respond well to treatment. 









 Cool data, horrible visualization. =( 




 As automotive automation and natural language interfaces become more advanced it'll be interesting to see how much the common jobs change. Perhaps in 20 years this map would be mostly software developers.

 




 This isn't really something they can push things for that limit the cyber rights of citizens. This is a company that was attacked by hackers and it doesn't relate to NSA policies that people have grown to hate (and probably should).

I can see a few legislation proposals:

* Tougher sentences for those who hack with malicious intent
* Sentences for those who support those who hack with malicious intent
* More security assurances required by holders of large amounts of customer information
* Fines for companies found to lack sufficient data security

All of which I would support.  




 It's impressive how quickly they are shuttering Office Depot stores. One near me was open this morning, and then I drove by this evening and the windows were boarded up and all but the main street sign had been taken down. 




 That's what happens when you don't have a screen for a fireplace.  









 Saudi Arabia is what happens when a group like the Islamic State comes to power and people are no longer willing to fight it.

When the barbaric ISIS members behead people or cut off the hands of criminals in the street the world cries foul. When the Saudi's do it the world largely accepts it.

Saudi Arabia is the ultimate functioning terrorist state.  




 This seems very Google glass like. Very cool technology, but unlikely to be adopted by consumers barring some killer app.  




 It looks like you live inside of a lego. 









 This article doesn't have much backing evidence to suggest the downfall is imminent. In my area shopping malls were largely left idle and empty shortly after the 2008 financial collapse. However recently I've definitely seen a big uptick in the number of active stores and customers in the malls around my region.

If they are estimating the collapse based on the dwindling number of new malls being built that seems like a poor metric. Many of those malls built prior to 2008 were bad ideas, and now the backers realize that... so why would they build more? 




 Yep. Statistically Hispanics are not very wealthy in the US, but it's certainly not absolute. 




 There is a coalition already doing this. The US is performing most of the strikes, but additionally you've got Jordan, Saudi Arabia, France, Britain, Iran (coordinated through Iraq), among others providing support against ISIS. 




 Japan is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. It's time to share that technology with ISIS, in the most meaningful way possible: attacks from the sky.

If Japan does not retaliate militarily it will appear weak and frightened.  




 As virtual reality and robotic technology grows we'll probably see wealthy population fertility rates plunge much like in Japan. As sick as it is, it's bound to happen. Porn alone probably has a statistically noticeable effect on the amount people have sex with real people. 

HoloLens anyone? 




 I hope Japan unleashes hell upon these cowards. ISIS is now a direct threat to Japan, and should be decimated. 




 How the hell did this woman become a patrolling officer? This is the same woman who recently came under fire for lying about an elderly black man threatening her with a golf club (it was his walking aid), and she has had other incidents in the past.

She's on "administrative assignment" now. I support police... But god damn. Seattle: Take her off the force already, she has no business being there.  









 I'm surprised they ignored me as someone who sells plutonium down by the corner of 5th and Main.

Come on 56. Come on 56!

... I get very little correspondence.  









 Because of rising nationalism and the perception that people are willing to sacrifice more to expand their country. If he backs down now Russia will look weak, mostly because of the language used by both sides in their "demands". Russia leadership has to make it look like they've won something, and they likely bit off more than they can chew when they weren't satisfied with Crimea. If they lose ground Russia will appear weak and nationalism will fall, and meanwhile the economy will still be in tatters. 

I think they also want to make a strong statement for why Baltic states should not move towards NATO, and it's because of the threat of "separatism" (aka being invaded by Russia under a guise).  Imposing fear of demise (country, person or otherwise) is a tactic that works well. Just look at the case of former KGB agent that was poisoned with plutonium in Western Europe after publicly challenging Putin and his ways. You can bet your ass such people will now be much more hesitant to publicly criticize Putin if they previously served with him or were in a position of power.   



















 There is an old abandoned garnet mining town in Idaho where I used to go as a kid. It was pretty incredible, there were huge piles of discarded garnets just feet from the forest service roads. On field trips we'd load up solo cups full of shiny garnets and take them home much to the dismay of our parent's who would be finding garnets all over the house for weeks to come.  




 It's good to know that all of those Islamic Extremists walking out in the open and manning checkpoints during this video are probably dead or cowering in corners now. 




 Interesting, I did not realize this. They are also one of the biggest supporters of the new Iraqi government/military. I wonder where the bigger allegiance lies. 




 Doubtful. The Kurd fighters are skilled and dedicated, but they do not have very large numbers. Iraq would likely have support from Iran and other regional governments... Possibly even the US in a giant clusterfuck.

The Kurds would gain nothing by attacking the Iraqi government, and vice versa.  









 It seems as though they asked the question to randomly selected registered voters over the phone, along with a lot of other questions. If I were put on the spot and also a bit annoyed on the phone, my mind my go blank and I might mutter "I don't know" and the pollster would check a box and move on... even through I do know of quite a few living scientists. 




 Just looked at his wikipedia page... JK Simmons is one prolific worker! How the hell does he have time to do anything else =O  




 Interesting. I wonder how this will affect the job market. From my perspective things are starting to slow down in the engineering market, or at the least becoming saturated. When I used to do interviews as late as 2012 for my employer it became a bidding/benefits war to get the top talent... Now we often have many very high quality candidates to choose from that have been looking for work for months, usually after jumping ship from startups.

Even though those 100k IBM employees being let go surely aren't all engineers, it's gotta have some impact on that already changing market. It's going to be interesting times for sure... 




 There is a lot of infrastructure which is weak all over the developed world, and in the US for the electrical grid it's amplified by the vastness of the country. If someone wanted to do major disruptive damage to our infrastructure, it would unfortunately not be very difficult. 




 It's becoming clear that Russia is not going to back down. NATO really isn't standing up for Ukraine outside of harsh remarks. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, the threat of Russian advancement and land grabs is a major threat to members, especially when it's done in a way that's so hard to prove (with Russia claiming the Russians there are "volunteers").

NATO should begin providing Ukraine with better defense and anti-tank equipment and if necessary more offensive weapons too. Russia is not going to wave the flag of surrender, so the best thing to do is forcefully halt the advance and deal with the consequences of previous incursions and land exchanges. 




 "Confirmed on twitter?"

That link isn't even the same thing. Their report says there were unconfirmed reports on twitter of an execution and the hostage situation is still unknown. Your "article" AND your spammy reddit submission from yesterday both stated that the hostages had been executed.

All your posts are for the same damn spam website.  




 Dude. Stop using the hostage situation as a way to spam your website to get more views... Yesterday you were wildly linking to your blogspam about the hostages both being executed, which was false and inappropriate. 




 Turkey was a Muslim nation/government done right... but for the last few years it's really been headed for the dumps. I hope the good people of Turkey will fight the government and push for a return of true secularism and freedom.  




 It's spam, and the OP is a horrible person for trying to get website views out of potentially traumatizing bit of information that is completely baseless at this point.

Look at the OPs history. All of his submissions are for this blogspam site. 




 *"unconfirmed reports on twitter"*. 

I don't see ANY reputable news source reporting on their deaths. Instead I see news reports about how Japan is still holding Skype talks with ISIS "representatives".

Their fate is currently unknown. 




 No. That's a ridiculously large amount of grain. It must be at a major port? We took in about 40 loads daily during the Summer with the average load coming out to around 700 bushels per truck (our trucks weren't semi's, but they were still fairly large). That comes out to 28,000 bushels per day. Let's say we had 60 days of loads coming in at that rate, though it was actually over a longer period due to different source regions and grain coming out of other neighbor's storage. That puts us at 1,680,000 bushels of incoming loads per summer.

According to Google the average weight per bushel of wheat is 60lbs, which gives us a grand total estimate of 100,800,000 lbs coming into the elevator (and also eventually leaving it) for a total of ~50,000 tons per year. That's a drop in the bucket compared to what your elevator has coming in. 

With the physics of heat and aging aside, one year at your elevator is equal to 60 years in ours. Which means we shouldn't have to worry about replacing out chutes until... oh... about the year 2240 =)

 




 Most likely the chutes are poorly engineered, and/or perhaps the metal is softer than it should be? My family has a grain elevator that has functioned with very high traffic every summer/fall, and spring. During the summer when everyone is harvesting, it's in constant use (neighbors use it too) from about 7AM to 11PM. 

It was built in the 40s, and I've never seen anything like the damage to your chute, especially after 5-10 years. Our chutes and pipes are shined up for sure, but structurally sound. Where was your chute located? At the end of a **very** large and high angled drop perhaps? 




 *Russian forces

They might as well be the Russian army, they are being trained, supported and supplied just as normal Russian army units would. 




 +1 for the GIF of SeaNilly being smited. 




 I think the major factor here is that with Glass the intention was to have it worn all the time... whereas this Hololens is more for special use scenarios where it can be more immersive.

I want to wear my VR at my choosing for fun experiences. Not be forced to wear it all the time and look like a dork just to get my moneys worth. 




 As much as I'd like to stick it to an advertiser, I choose to answer truthfully because unskewed data is a source of income for website/service owners who do provide valuable information.  




 Do you have more than just links to Google queries? I don't see any stories about crowds attacking and burning mosques.  




 Maybe they'll even get some picketers near the business just to spread the word to those who don't spend much time online. Though if the manager is really the nut job people are saying he is online, he'll probably shoot them, 




 Saudi Arabia's government should be the civilized world's and the United States greatest enemy if everything was based on principles. 














 "US elects new President. Nowhere to be seen." 




 It's awesome that it also worked on the mosquito species they tested, but I wonder how viable this is in terms of the amount of light/energy required? In their paper they describe the rough number of protons required... can someone provide an equivalent  measurement in laymen's terms? 




 I see them popping up all over in bigger cities, almost to the point where I wonder about credentials, as they are even showing up in small strip malls.

For most smaller towns however urgent care facilities are usually shared with the ER. It can be confusing because if it's past hours or you don't explicitly request urgent care, you will be charged ER rates.
