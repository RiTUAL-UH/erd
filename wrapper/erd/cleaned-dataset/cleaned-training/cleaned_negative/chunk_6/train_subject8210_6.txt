 You're an idiot pal.

Says the guy who "can't" provide links.

We're done.

You've said this about 4 times now.  You're not very credible. 




  for some reason this makes creating links problematic,

Isn't that convenient.............

Follow - the - instructions - I've - given - and you'll be there in the wink of a pixie's twat. 

And as I've stated, it's not my job to support your case.  That's on you.  I want to see the site you pulled each quote from.  It's easy to make something up and throw it online and say it's true.

*"Reddit user -mArtiAn- caught fondling goats overnight at local farm."~Farmer Bob.*

It must be true now.  And I don't have to provide a link to show a credible source that I took it from.  It is true because I said so. 




 What the hell difference does it make if she's black or not?  I mean, the group is called the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  If she's working to advance colored people, then what's the problem? 




 You're being stupidly evasive

How so?  I'm asking you to support your statements with the links/sources.  Yet you haven't.  

And I'm the one being evasive?  OK......... 




 Link? 




 But if you're going to continually cite my inability to create links

I'm going to continually cite your inability to support your statements with sources. 




 You don't even know how to operate your own phone and, while you can look up random quotes on the internet and store them in a folder on your phone, you don't know how to look up how to use your phone.  

[OK.......](http://i.giphy.com/hhy5zwTKXRXxe.gif)

To avoid the appearance of nepotism as the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, he changed his name early in his career to Nicolas Cage, inspired in part by the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage. 









 Still don't see the importance though, I'm not quoting the source.

Because it gives fuller context to the quote, as well as highlights what site is reporting on the article so you can immediately notate the likelihood of bias. Additionally, merely because people may have said something, does not mean they witnessed it firsthand. They may be repeating something that an unknown person told them or have heard about elsewhere potentially making the information circular anyway and ultimately all from one source.

Quotes like these are easily verified.

Then verify it.  Show me links.

You want to dismiss them without consideration, fine.

I'm asking you to support your posts.  Apparently, you are unable to do that.  Speaks volumes about the credibility of either the quote or the source you used.
 


































 I don't know how to make links on this phone. 

Since you're supposedly so adept at looking things up on Google, maybe you should do the same with this.

That stuff is all bits I've saved in my tinfoil, conspiracy nut folder.

[Seriously?](http://i.giphy.com/i4OfVOFke0jxm.gif)  You save quotes on your phone about this?

Why's a link so important,

Because it gives fuller context to the quote, as well as highlights what site is reporting on the article so you can immediately notate the likelihood of bias.  Additionally, merely because people may have said something, does not mean they witnessed it firsthand.  They may be repeating something that an unknown person told them or have heard about elsewhere potentially making the information circular anyway and ultimately all from one source.

just copy and paste 

You mean like what you should do with the links for the quotes you provided?

and look it up

We've been through this before.  You provided the quote, you provide the source.  Not my job to support your case.

 it's pretty easy to trace this shit to its source. 

Then it should be pretty easy for you to provide the links to the sources you provided.   




 So you were able to copy/paste all of those but not the links from where you pulled them?  

Ok buddy.... 




 Must have forgotten its Life Alert. 




 credible

Here's the thing.  How do you know they are truly credible?  Because someone threw it up on the internet and said they were?  What you did is you searched "credible" and looked for things that supported your already held ideas.  Ever seen [this](http://www.challengefuture.org/static/upload/uploads/abe-lincoln.jpg)?  There is a reason that was made.  Because too many people believe what they find on the internet to be true just because it's on the internet.

sorry if I've been rude with you, but I find it extremely insulting to be called nuts for exercising basic logic.

I don't recall calling you "nuts" but when someone wants to be a jackass and make statements like:

And that sir, is the marvelous way in which the masses give themself permission to exercise zero logic rather than consider a potentially uncomfortable truth. Go back to sleep America.
 
and

Gomer, what, now you can't fucking read either?

and 

I gave you the name, find it yourself you lazy cunt.

You can then take your "I'm insulted" and shove it up your ass sideways.  Hell, you already said once you were done with this topic but you still came back.  Why?  I guess you lie and are thus not a credible person.  [Take care.](http://gph.is/14hiivF)

 




 And the quotes?   




 Again, not my job to support your own postings.  Your inability to provide the source of your information tells one of two things.  

1) You're full of shit.

2) You're internet "sources" are not credible and very likely from 9/11 conspiracy sites. 




 So, to summarize, your answer is "No, I don't have any links/sources for these quotes and what not that I am posting." 




 I mean really, do you have any links/sources for these quotes and what not you're posting?  You're obviously copying/pasting from somewhere.  Let's see from where shall we? 




 not gonna find the paper

"I can't support my statements"

More quotes. Great. Give me facts pal. Quotes don't mean shit.  




 You provided a quote buddy. What's the context? I can say "My cock is the size of a Yukon GMC". Does it make it true?  Fuck no! 




 It's up to you to back yourself up. Not me. 

Do you see prosecutors making the case for a defendant?  I sure don't. 

Back out all you want. If you can't back up and support yourself with credible evidence, that's on you. Enjoy your tin foil hat.  




 Look into it and let us know. 




 She'd still be cheating and thus, would become my ex-girlfriend or ex-wife. 




 consider a potentially uncomfortable truth

Bring facts to the table and I'll consider it.  Otherwise, I'll carry on with my life not wearing a tin foil hat. 




 And?  Lots of stuff happens every day that is "absurdly unusual."  

 




 Hell yeah I do!  I never understood the stigma surrounding people who go to movies/bars/etc by themselves.  I have fun with it.  I can come and go as I please and I usually end up having conversations with interesting people I never would have spoken to otherwise if I was with others.

If people want to judge you based on you doing things alone, let them have at it.  They are the ones with issues that they need to deal with. 




 Hoping they will look in the mirror and realize that "Hey, I'm not a religious expert.  Maybe I should quit preaching it." 









 So does that mean these fuckers will stop telling us what should be done because of what is right/wrong by the bible? 




 All of them.  

Well, except for the one that al-Qaida planned/plotted the attack.  That one is true. 




 What about it?   




 The only issue with that line of thinking is that the police don't know your intent.  For all they know, you're waiting to get to an area more "friendly" for you. 




 It's not like we can change the laws...

This is a line of crap right here and an example of the attitude as to why laws won't change, because people accept defeat without even trying.  If you want laws to change, it can be done but time, work, and effort need to be put into it.  Hell, look at where things are moving with cannabis.  Change can happen.

What if the crimes are victimless and the laws are unjust? 

Prove to a solid majority of people in your area with unbiased information that supports your point that the crimes are victimless or laws unjust.  Simply saying it doesn't make it so.  It just sounds like one person stating an opinion.

Like selling cannabis or sex? 

I personally believe, and this is only my opinion, that there are more crimes and "victims" with these two items being illegal in most places.  The only reason I can figure why they haven't been legalized is because the people in office haven't yet figured out how to make more money off of them with them being legal yet. 




 Which is not relevant at all.  Police don't make people commit crime.  The people who commit crimes do that on their own.  If they chose to stop committing crimes, the need for police would drop. 




 It's Saturday.  Go live a life.

Two studies published in 2013 and 2014 have found that people who are identified as trolls tend to have dark personality traits and show signs of sadism, antisocial behavior, psychopathy, and machiavellianism. The 2013 study suggested that there are a number of similarities between anti-social and flame trolling activities and the 2014 study suggested that the noxious personality characteristics known as the "dark triad of personality" should be investigated in the analysis of trolling, and concluded that trolling appears "to be an Internet manifestation of everyday sadism." Their relevance is suggested by research linking these traits to bullying in both adolescents and adults. The 2014 study found that trolls operate as agents of chaos on the Internet, exploiting hot-button issues to make users appear overly emotional or foolish in some manner. If an unfortunate person falls into their trap, trolling intensies for further, merciless amusement. This is why novice Internet users are routinely admonished, "Do not feed the trolls!" The 2013 study found that trolls often have a high expectation of what it means to be successful, which is higher than they are able to attain, and this results in them resenting others who think they are successful but who fall below their standards.

In 1791, partly as a result of the Copper Panic of 1789, Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits, which led to protests in frontier districts, especially Pennsylvania. By 1794, after Washington ordered the protesters to appear in U.S. district court, the protests turned into full-scale defiance of federal authority known as the Whiskey Rebellion. The federal army was too small to be used, so Washington invoked the Militia Act of 1792 to summon militias from Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey. The governors sent the troops with Washington taking initial command. He then subsequently named Henry "Lighthorse Harry" Lee as field commander of the troops being marched into the rebellious districts. The rebels dispersed and there was no fighting, as Washington's forceful action proved the new government could protect itself. These events marked the first time under the new constitution that the federal government used strong military force to exert authority over the states and citizens and is also the only time a sitting U.S. president personally commanded troops in the field. 









 No. Especially since the reason given by many isn't even the reason the subreddits were banned in the first place so they don't even know what their point is.  




 Other than the incessant whining of little children, it's fine to me. 




 Were you required to purchase gold or spend money on redditgifts to use the site? 




 TIL many redditors don't understand what the First Amendment truly means.

You mean like all the people crying because the subreddit they use on a free service was taken down? 




 So why didn't you just like, not look at any fathate* pages or posts?

I never said I did.

And one more question, do you enjoy looking at all of the other racy subs? Did these ones just strike a nerve with you?

You very clearly don't understand why these specific subreddits were removed.  Instead of following the mob mentality, go out and educate yourself as to why it was actually done. 




 Nope. 




 Shut the same subreddits down that they did and carry on with their day. 




 If you say "Hi" to a redditor they will get pissed off half the time.  The people who are in an uproar need to step away from their computer, open the front door, and realize there is a great big world outside with lots of interesting things to experience other than reddit and a subreddit being deleted that was provided free of charge anyway. 




 I saw similar once in my son's preschool class. 




 Wow, the sense of entitlement is worse than I thought in this place.  Are any of these morons paying to use reddit, imgur, or other sites that are in actuality free to use?   




 No.  

I really don't get the uproar.  This site is free to use, as is imgur and others of the like.  Reddit has no obligation to allow you to do whatever the hell you want.  If you were paying them to use their services I could see an argument but as it stands, you're not.

Raccoons can carry rabies, a lethal disease caused by the neurotropic rabies virus carried in the saliva and transmitted by bites. Its spread began in Florida and Georgia in the 1950s and was facilitated by the introduction of infected individuals to Virginia and North Dakota in the late 1970s. Of the 6,940 documented rabies cases reported in the United States in 2006, 2,615 (37.7%) were in raccoons. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as local authorities in several U.S. states and Canadian provinces, has developed oral vaccination programs to fight the spread of the disease in endangered populations. Only one human fatality has been reported after transmission of the rabies virus strain commonly known as "raccoon rabies". Among the main symptoms for rabies in raccoons are a generally sickly appearance, impaired mobility, abnormal vocalization, and aggressiveness. There may be no visible signs at all, however, and most individuals do not show the aggressive behavior seen in infected canids; rabid raccoons will often retire to their dens instead. Organizations like the U.S. Forest Service encourage people to stay away from animals with unusual behavior or appearance, and to notify the proper authorities, such as an animal control officer from the local health department. Since healthy animals, especially nursing mothers, will occasionally forage during the day, daylight activity is not a reliable indicator of illness in raccoons.

there's actually video evidence that it was a neighbourhood lady coming over to fight with the kids
