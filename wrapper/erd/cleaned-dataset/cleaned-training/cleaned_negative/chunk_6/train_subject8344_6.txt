 Thank you. :D 




 What medicine do you take? 




 Sure thing.  




 Looking for a two bedroom rental in Bidderford for a wonderful family.

I posted about this before:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/3bodcn/hey_maine_an_awesome_family_really_needs_your_help/


But now we are looking for something more permanent for them. They have good jobs, are good people and just need a place **immediately** to move into. We have the proper funds but need something affordable and right away.

Please help me find this family a place. They are currently in a hotel and need something to move into now. 




 Which I would be happy to do. And we would be happy to promote your sub as well.  




 You fail to mention that over half of that money given came from me. I gave her that money because I know it was a legitimate cause. You people just love to omit any fact that does  not support your twisted  bullshit witch hunts. 

Please if you think you can do it better, I challenge you to do so. You will soon see how hard it is to give thousands of dollars to people and then have worthless pieces of crap like you make such accusations. 




 Hey whatever works. :D 




 Good for you.

 If the clerk's office had another person that would issue the license there all the time, that would be fine. But that is not the case. These people are being told they have to go to another county. As long as the service is provided, then it would be up to the office there to decide if they want to keep her. But many places are not going to hire two people to do the job of one.

And with the McDonald's analogy, if the employer wanted to hire someone knowing that they would just do fries, that would be up to the employer. Not the employee. 




 I have no room to talk. I'm trying to work up the balls to do this myself. I just see your week as an enormous accomplishment. I am jealous. I would hate to see it go to waste.  




 Having just one cig will hurt more than any other cigarette you will ever have. Man i am so envious of you quitting for a week. As I work up the balls to quit myself, I see folks like you who have made it a week and am amazed.

Seriously dude, you are awesome for what you have done. Don't blow it now.  




 You never know. They may already be doing it. :O 




 This lady is the only one in that entire county that performs that duty. If she can't deliver to 10% of the population due to religious beliefs, then they either have to get another person that does, or replace her altogether. 

But even so, as a liberal, I do not agree with the headscarf thing. A company should have the right to dictate the uniform. 

 




 If your religion forbids it then it up to you to do what it takes to comply. 

 




 I love this! :D 




 Exactly!

 ***Did you see the part where may violate his rights?*** 




 "May" being the operative word. To rule in his favor would open up such a can of worms that cause chaos. It's not going to happen. Just like the clerk will not be able to refuse marriage licenses. If your religion doesn't let you, then you need to get another job. 




 Then he needs to get a different job too. Don't see any religious obstacles in the laundry department. 




 They do the same with the constitution, the bible, and states rights. Only when it suits them. 




  Trump on Mexican immigrants: "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."

So he assumes some of the rapists are good people?

  She pledged to never issue a marriage license to a gay couple.

 Its a deep-rooted conviction; my conscience wont allow me to do that, Davis said Tuesday. It goes against everything I hold dear, everything sacred in my life.

Well that is fine and dandy. I have no problem with that honey. But you obviously have to get a new job then.

If it is against my religion to eat cows, I can not work at McDonald's and refuse to sell people hamburgers. 
 




 Cool.

 Hillary Clinton's 2015 shattered the $26 million the former first lady raised raised in the first quarter of her 2008 bid. That number was made up of $19.1 million for the primary, and $6.9 million for the general election.

The aide added that 91% of Clinton's donations were $100 or less

 Cool. Good to know.  Just have to get these folks over one last hump. :D 




 Those damn sporkelfrackenloogersplatas. 




 They are one normal looking family. Hard workers and great people. A pic would be a great idea. 




 Thank you very much for the info. You guys are providing some great leads. :D 




 See, I am already confused. 




 Thanks to you awesome people in Maine, we have some really good leads. We'll know tomorrow when they arrive. Fingers crossed. :D 




 Thank you. Your post is all set. Good luck. :D 




 Cool. We have a place for them to stay for a few days already.  We will attack the rest when they get heretomorrow. :D 




 Thanks for your response. We are having some luck here and the people of Maine are impressing the hell out of me. Some very kind people there. 

They will arrive in the state tomorrow and hopefully one of these leads will pan out. If not they may have to so what you suggest. Having the four girls will prove difficult. they can't leave them in the woods while they go to work. But we are working on a solution.

And by-the-way:

Happy Cakeday!

 Thank you. I have been calling some of them. Very pricey for this weekend. I think we may have better luck after the 4th. Thanks so much for reading and offering your advice. Much appreciated. 

Have a happy 4th. :D 




 Thanks for helping. We'll get them through this. It sure helps to have folks like you help us with some leads. Thank you so much. :D 




 That is a great suggestion. Being 4th of July weekend coming up, we are having an extremely difficult time finding some. But we haven't ruled that option out. :D 




 A cabin would be awesome. I would help with the rent if it is not too much. 




 I am the head mod over at r/assistance where we help people in amazing ways due the the awesomeness of reddit..


Currently we have a family, one that is very dear to me and I will vouch for wholehearted. Actually it is one of my long time mods who has helped hundreds of others. The husband and wife worked at the same place and long story short they lost their jobs due to a very unruly owner.

The two have both found new jobs in Biddeford. They start Friday. They have packed up all their belongings and are currently in Vermont heading that way. But they have no place to stay. I have found arrangements for them and their four girls, and two small dogs as of July 7th. But they need a place to stay until then. Even someone's backyard. 

They start their new life but need help with a place to stay for the week so they can go to work. The last thing we want is for them to screw up on the new job. It was a magnificent break for them both to get jobs there.

Again these are good people and they just need to get through this tough time. For now, all we need is place for them to stay this next week. Maybe somewhere in Biddeford, Alfred, or Saco.

They really need your help. Please open your hearts and help me help them. I personally guarantee they are a good honest family. I am lucky to call them friends.  




 The GOP may be regretting a lot of things. We can only hope. 




 Best of luck. :D

 Sure they cool. Just over-rated. 




 Firefighters are severely overrated. More people risk their lives every day constructing a building than saving them from burning down. I know lots of firefighters. Many of them are douches and think they are god's gift to society.

 Reddit expected to get 68 posts about it.

 Yes, Real Clear Politics who predicted Romney would win handily. 




 #When the past calls, let it go to voicemail, believe me, it has nothing new to say. 




 Yes. Have you watched MSNBC lately? Rachel does stuff on him every night. He gets way more coverage than Hillary. The same on the Huffington Post. With some 20 declared candidates and a plethora of those who  soon will, Bernie gets the most coverage out of all of them. 




 real clear bias

Boy that website sure has gone downhill. 




 Bernie is getting plenty of coverage. More so than almost any other candidate. This whining about coverage is getting old. It also is not true. 




 He didn't lose it. In fact he kind of fucks with the director. It was quite humorous.
