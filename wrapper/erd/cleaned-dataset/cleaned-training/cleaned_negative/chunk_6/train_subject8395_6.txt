 Me there a month ago. I actually stood on that set. Here is that photo but you can see a lot more. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151883610634208 set=pb.834289207.-2207520000.1379889721. type=3 theater 




 If people ain't seen it, they ain't seen it. 









 Happy Birthday too us Mister Crash Bandicoot. 




 She was really pleasant to talk too despite her day off and was happy to take a picture. You'd be surprised actually, another 6 people recognised her when she was walking away.  




 It is indeed. 




 She is actually filming outside of Dubrovnik at the moment so could be filming anything anywhere ;) 




 While her physique gave us the clue, I recognised her by the scar on her lip while walking alongside her.

 I bet you are right and I have only been too one place so far.
