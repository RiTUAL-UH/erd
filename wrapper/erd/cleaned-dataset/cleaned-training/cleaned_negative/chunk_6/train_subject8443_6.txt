 Try a telescopic pole from Home Depot or something. Pretty much the same price and you get something lighter and longer than a broomstick.

Definitely going to need a shock mount of some kind or you are going to get mad handling noise! 




 The I/O setup is great! It definitely looks like they heard the complaints about Audio input for the other cameras. No meters and all that. Now they have huge meters and you can see the waveform, I'll be able to check levels on camera from across set, or from a plane.   Crazy, but awesome.  




 I started on the 744t and it is awesome. But it has some limitations . For starters, you need to pair it with a field mixer like like the 442 or 552 in order for it to be really useful. And the end result is a 4-track recorder.

Where as the 664 is a Mixer with a built in recorder. It still has timecode, it has a much quicker UI and a lot more Input and Output settings. It is shipped as a 6 track recorder but with a newer firmware update, is capable of having 12 iso tracks, which is amazing for the price.  I find it to be a lot more User friendly than the 700 series Sound Devices. And compared to a 744t/552 package is it cheaper and has more iso tracks.

One of the downsides is it is powered by 5 AA batteries that last all of about 1.5hr. But that is because AAs are only there to play backup to your external power, like a battery distribution kit. 

All together, the 744t running off the Sony rechargables will probably put you at a $5000. And the 664t with the very necessary battery distro pack would put you at about $5200. It is a much better deal.  




 Definitely one of the reasons H4ns are prosumer. But for a lot of people on this form they only budget a few hundred for sound equipment and the Tascam and h4n are their best bets. 

I'm running a Sound Devices 664, but that is a whole other level of investing haha
