 Come back in 10 days or somethin'

I'm a last-minute kind of guy. [](/derpsrs) 




 I'm boring with my ships.

Fluttermac, Soarin'Dash, and TwiDash. 

[](/pinkiefear) 




 Yeah, I normally do that, but I've got a pretty terrible shotgun right now, so I'm alternating between assault rifle and revolver and firing from the hip with the sniper (I've put some points into the accuracy trait.)

I'm struggling in the caustic caverns, I've got a little too far in the story for my level and everything is kicking my ass down there atm.  




 Yeah, I always end up just picking their HP down with a Slag sniper, but I always end up running out of enemies, and I'm not near a reinforcements button. I'll get to it eventually, I just like trying as I see them. 




 Theshers. Full stop. All of them.

Goliaths - not because they're hard, but because I'm trying to get the Goliath - Meet David achievement. I can never have them get that last level.

Anything that moves fast. Stalkers, Rats.. I'm a sniper, can't do shit to 'em. 




 I did practically nothing!

Mostly trying to adjust my sleep schedule for my new hours at work.

[](/ppfreakout)But I played a lot of Vidya games. this is bad, I should be studying or writing my novel.  




 He's just turned 11 this year. Gettin' a bit old now, We've had him since I was around 12 years old, I'm 23 in about a month. 

Still, he outruns me when I go jogging and still likes to play [](/mlyra) 




 Aaaah! Goldie! I love Golden retrievers. Big, strong, loyal and fluffy.

A bit like Big Mac, then.

[](/macstare "wait what?") 




 For anyone who still wants to check the mail links, this is a really nifty Chrome extension that removes everything but the article. 

[Mail Sanitiser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mail-sanitiser/ncghnblnficlppbkjdnfljpackcjhfma) 




 [](/rtwiwtf)Hurt my pride a little, I was wearing steelies/waterproofs, So I was just stomping about through frozen puddles. Then one was too thick so I just slipped instead.

[](/ajsly)Border Collie licks aren't sloppy anyway. What dog have you got? 
 




 'Tis rather nippy out there. Walked the dog down the park and slipped on a patch of ice.

[](/cheereww) Dog thought that was code for "Give kisses now" so he decided to walk on over and lick my face off.  




 During the main cutscenes, subtitles show what the character's actually saying, but elsewhere, it's just "Mumbles" "Groans" "Roars"

Remade my character. I tried to Humanise and R63 Zecora.

[I'm super lazy when it comes to customisation.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hZn81eDSDhs/ULtqJn5rOAI/AAAAAAAAdf4/l3sOv0Cv4NY/s1531/2012-12-02_00001.jpg)

[](/zecorawat) 




 I made a new character to play with a friend on Co-op

He has fabulous bright pink hair, looks old, and has a voice like a zombie.
Can't understand a word he says, but it's hilarious. 

[](/hahaha) 




 Meanwhile, I do things like [this](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NI8UWVtUgLI/ULfprXxZpLI/AAAAAAAAdY0/zuYVkWKGVvY/s1493/ss+%282012-11-29+at+11.01.50%29.jpg)

[](/ppend "I should at least try and take it a bit more seriously")
 




 How about a delicious can of Tab? [](/flutterlean) 




 I got one a few years ago on my day off.

Played like you did - they asked to use the remote desktop connection. Uh, no.

Laid into 'em. Asked them how the fuck could they know I have a virus?

I know I don't have a virus because I check my system damn near every night, and I'm not a stupid fuck, I know what to download and from where.

They hung up midway through my rant. :(

[](/btwicrazy) 




 I know that feel, I just added 5 more games to my "To Finish" list.

[I posted this 3 days ago.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lr5WGl-6D9g/ULPH9sObipI/AAAAAAAAdLQ/h15K5Zpwf-k/s567/SEETHIS.png) 

There's probably more to actually finish, but I'll probably never play them. I picked them up because they were HOLY SHIT CHEAP! - played them once, couldn't get into it, abandoned

I now have 125 games in my steam list.

[](/twiannoyed "I'm procrastinating on playing games, what is wrong with me?") 




 Well it's pretty dark out, just past midnight here.

And I just remembered, I haven't put my frost guard on my car windscreen. [](/twidurr)

Tomorrow morning is going to be fun. 




 Would you ever get a pony-related tattoo? Subtle or Loud, doesn't matter! 




 I wouldn't wish a Mancunian accent on anyone, nor scourse. A good Yorkshire accent might be good on AJ 




 was thinking something show-related, not fanon, but tempting!

Was thinking maybe Twi's cutie mark on my shoulder or something, small and inconspicuous - All my tats mean something to me! Ponies have been a huge part of my life for the past year and a half.. 




 It's a little awkward when silence hits and small talk has to be initiated. 

I'm _terrible_ at that.[](/tsawkward) 




 Yeah! Red is awesome. [You need context, but this is one of the saddest scenes in the game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxn1kxzwL4s).

He's a bit like me. Don't talk unless you got somethin' to say, and make sure it's worth talking about. 

[](/twibiggrin "Makes me sound antisocial, huh?") 




 I go to the best artist in Bolton - he charges 70 an hour, this was 3 hours so far, and I'm due for another hour, maybe hour and a half, so this as is cost me 210, with another possible 105 on top.

[](/twidance) Worth it! 




 This is my 3rd Tat, I'm considering maybe getting a subtle pony tat next. 

But gotta get this finished first! It wraps all the way across my arm pretty much..

Red XIII has been my favourite character in any media EVER for the past **15** years, only felt right to get a full tattoo of him to honour the decade-and-a-half 









 Labour voter all the way through here. After the last election and the debates, was close to marking down Lib Dem for their policies, but my MP is rockin'.

Bolton North is a safe labour seat anyway.. 




 I fight the system. I look at NSFW at work! Ha ha!
But seriously, I'm sat in an office and my screens face away from everyone else. :D 




 I think I'm going to go curl up in a corner of the office for now.

Damn man, what was going through your head? ;_;

[](/cadancewat) 




 So, sort of like [this](http://cartoonlion.deviantart.com/art/MLP-And-Then-Foals-Happened-245427860) then?

[](/cmcgrin1) 




 I have my kindle, and I swear by it!

I do miss physical books though. They smell nice.

You better smell them when they arrive.

[](/twismug) 




 Black Friday. MEH. BritPony here.

Although those Amazon deals they had looked pretty sweet, I'm broke as noodles until Payday - which is this thursday! 

[](/discordsmile) 




 [](/dashiechef) I guess I would look a little nuts if I said I'm excited for the day my name gets pulled

Probably. 




 Eh, why not. I've always wanted to do an AMA! [](/05) 




 I posted mine the other day because holy fucknuts so much dashie, but here's mine again.

[Would you believe me if I said Applejack was best pony?](http://i.imgur.com/xbyNA.jpg)

[](/5c "What, I can't help it if I'm still deciding")
 




 I'm cravin' some crisps right about now.

Mmm, cheese and onion crisp butty..[](/twigrin) 




 Stop it, you're making me hungry! [](/ajsad) 




 Well, duh! McMuffins are the best. [](/twiexcited) 




 [](/dhexcited)**YES!**

Now I want one. [](/rdcry) 




 So do I. I feel like I accomplished something today.[](/derp) 




 Guess! [](/derppoker) 




 Stuck at work.

Bored.

But I have breakfast! [](/ajyay) 




 I wish to be tagged, but please hold on the Spray paint.[](/27) 




 The ping! _The Ping!_ [](/thehorror) 




 They would kill us all - including themselves. They want to be Martyrs. Their Leader - Aragath Brighteye - had a bad dream one night and based his whole terror act on that.

Of course, if they succeed, we'll be extinct. If they don't.. Well, We gotta be careful in that spaceship of ours.

I don't think they'd do anything to the rest of the Galaxy, but I wouldn't put it past that twisted freak to change his "vision" 




 I guess so. I mean, I've not even heard of that conflict.

All I know is, the Iskaldi think we're going to fuck the Galaxy up something fierce - so they're trying to stop us, either by isolating us to the planet, or by killing us all.

Evacuation plans are almost finished and we're in the last weeks of preparation, they're desperate and some fucknut in the Council left their access codes to the radioactive waste dumping ground. There's enough material in there to wipe us out ten times over. It's a race to get us off the planet before they find it. 




 [Here you go!](http://mamandil.deviantart.com/art/Tiny-Twi-has-a-cold-334418210)[](/ajwink) 




 Nah, it's cool. Just having a bit of fun with it, probably just running it the one time, like I did with Desktop Ponies 




 [](/scootscared)Make it stop!

http://puu.sh/1tWFJ 




 Pinkie breaks everything and makes multiple RDs appear.

[Please help.](http://i.imgur.com/xbyNA.jpg)

[](/spitfuck) 




 That's just about most mancs'[](/llaugh) response to anything thrown at them.
I'm serious. 




 [](/ajsoawesome)Oh man, Karl is the best.

I live in Manchester - where Karl is from. It's amazing when people say "What did he say?" and I understood him perfectly. 




 We, the Feln are a Race of peoples living on our planet - Luetem. We're in the Itern system.  Our Galaxy - Lomia - is the nearest neighbour of the Andromeda.

We're a - well, the humans said this, anyway - Feline-like race. Our legs are Digitigrade. Naturally curious, our technology evolved quickly. The Humans were surprised when our Recorded history was "only" 5,000 SUY old. It apparently took them around 10,000 SUY to even begin deep space exploration.

I mean, That's the Gist of it. I could probably go find a Scholar or something and they'll lecture you on what it _means_ to be a Feln or what have you. Boring stuff. 




 As one of their fellow countrymen, make sure they end up with a cone, or something similar on his head. Otherwise that night just didn't happen.

Seriously though. Drunk brits are either massive cunts, or giggly dunken messes. Make sure they go to bed!

[](/berryparty "A happy hungover person was one who woke up in bed!") 




 1. If it comes up in conversation, I'll say "Yeah, I'm Asexual". Though I have an Asexy bumper sticker. :D

2. Not that I can recall, I've never "wanted" to have sex and all that, just after getting to know some people "Hey, she'd be pretty cool to sit on the sofa and cuddle with"

3. Yes and no.. Sometimes I'll get the urge, It's a very tiny urge, easily ignorable. A few minutes and it goes away, nothing I'd act upon, even in a relationship.

4. If you call "Cuddling on the sofa and maybe eating ice cream" a sexual fantasy, go for it!

5. Intimacy is kind of important, but not a deal breaker, One of my favourite things to do when I used to hang out with my ex (We split for distance..) was just cuddle on the sofa.

[](/twismile "I Mean, who'd pass on snuggling on the sofa?!") 




 UK Here - I don't even remember _having_ sex ed lessons. Reproduction in humans came up in Biology, so that counts, right?

[](/grumpyjack) 




 Okay I actually felt ill looking at that one[](/ajyikes) 




 22 male here.

Been ace all my life pretty much. There's just no desire or attraction there.

As for "Coming out", unless they're really getting on your case about grandkids (Like mine were), I can't really see them caring. I mean - so what if you don't like doing the deed? It's not like you describe what goes on to them.

[](/ajhappy)Are you a Romantic Ace or Aromantic? That can make all the difference sometimes. 




 [](/bppseesyou) Sign up to the Facebook.. constantly getting competition info, lock-ins.. I used to go a bit before I got my rig set up proper, got absolutely packed on the weekends. 




 I'm hoping the Nexus 4 is back in stock.. Want so much! [](/dashiedowant) 




 So I just installed it after coming across this thread.

Holy crap how much have I missed? [](/twilight) 




 It's like the weather wanted to share in the misery. Windows nearly blew in at work.

ruddy rain. [](/whooves) 




 [](/ppboring) [Me neither.](http://imgur.com/8Ftvg) (Edited, because I left contact details in, like a numpty)
Luckily I work on the phone, so I can doodle while talking, it's great.


[](/flutterfear)Except I'm using up all my stickies. 




 I have survived many years of Alcohol abuse. Mostly with other bronies. That's always super fun.

Almost 23 here. You know you're getting old when no-one asks for ID anymore..

Also Happy Birthday! Drink one for all of us!
Yeah, all 6,811 of us. Make Berry proud! [](/punchdrunk) 




 I'm pretty high ranking as far as the foot soldiers are concerned, and I am "unofficially" brought in to advise the strategic council from time to time. 

Our current enemy is almost 1/4 of the population of the Feln, under control of a cult - the Iskaldi.

((Woops, good start there.. Typo'd her last name. It's Sharptooth) 




 I do have DOTA, but I've not played much, I'm pretty bad at it.  









 I'm playing a lot of GW2 recently, but I'm up for lots of things!

Mostly play PC - my sister pilfered my xbox. Add me on Steam if you want. :

Zeifer Rei (I'm the guy with the pony avatar) 




 I would, I miss wearing my old ring. Unfortunately I can't find one that I like. I'm not a big fan of elegant designs, and I can never find a plain black band on etsy.. 




 It's always funny finding out people's "Brony Origin" story. :D 




 First picture I saw?

[This one](http://i.neoseeker.com/mgv/485572-Jeremy/572/29/1298787074140_display.png)

Then I found /r/mylittlepony and it was all downhill from there. 




 wasn't that /r/reddit.com ? 




 Snacks? You want snacks?

Banana's are bitchin'.

Peel that sucker and bam! Instant fruity goodness. 




 Anywhere but his bed!

We leave him downstairs, he has a good wandering area. I'll come downstairs some nights and he'll be on the rug, in front of a chair, in a doorway, under a desk.. 

He's good and doesn't jump on chairs or beds unless you pat and say "Come on then!" 




 Border Collies are one of the best dogs around. You'll have a friend for life in Penny. Her colours are amazing too! 




 Yeah, that probably would have worked. I'm just as derp as she is, it seems. 




 Ah, RP instances like yours notwithstanding of course. Maybe he could make his own last name? :D 




 Okay, so I work in IT training, but I work with a particular girl who knows what she's doing most of the time, but sometimes has moments of extreme derp.

Anyway, we use a databasing software, which is limited to a set number of open process.
We wandered off for a quick meeting about the upcoming influx of Windows 8 machines we will be using to train our customers.

Anyhow, we come back, and our hero's computer [We'll call her Jane] was having a minor freakout. (I just bailed right to my desk on the other side of the room)

"[train_subject8542]! My computer's spazzing out, I've got like a bazillion copies of Customer Enquiry open! I've got an e-mail from [Network Dude] asking me to stop opening them, no-one can uses Axis!"

So I walk over to see what the fuss was about.
Her bag was on her keyboard.
for nearly 30 minutes, holding down enter.

"Your bag is on your keyboard, damnit!"

I forgot how long I was sat there clicking "Cancel" and "End process"
But we were all laughing about it the entire time. 

We had an in-joke, and it just got reinforced. 




 Nope, all of mine do. Always try and give last names to characters in MMOs if I can, makes my character feel more unique! 




 jtechs beat me to it. But what he says is pretty much it. I'll have to change my plan because I put my sim in an old sony xperia for a week or two while I sent my phone in for a repair and I leaped over my data limit like an Olympian leaping over hurdles. 500MB ftl.

giffgaff seem to do a pretty good deal here in the UK, unlimited internet and texts and 250mins of calls

 




 Super behind, mostly through starting late.
Only at 2k so far, but I'm beating my attempt from last year!

(That was Skyrim's fault) 




 I played with Symbian in 2010 and deemed it "Perfect for what I use it for".

Then months down the line, Nokia was all "Yeah, we're going Windows phone now."

Counting down the days for my "Contract renewal". Sim only, Nexus 4 here I come! 




 AS WELL AS ALL THAT COURSE SHIT I POSTED ABOUT THE OTHER DAY, I'VE GONE OFF THE FUCKING DEEP END NOW, COATED IN CONCRETE

I'M DOING THAT AMAZING FUN THING CALLED NANOWRIMO

TELL ME TO STOP LOOKING AT GOOGLE+ AND REDDIT AND GET MY ARSE WRITING. I NEED MOTIVATION 




 Walking, Gaming, Writing and usually once every two months, I'll jump the Pennines and get wankered 




 FUCK YOU.
I'M GOING TO GO LISTEN TO "PHOTOGRAPH" JUST TO SPITE YOU.

WHAT _IS_ THAT ON JOEY'S HEAD? 




 I WILL QUOTE SUM 41 ALL I LIKE FRIEND.

BUT THANK YOU

YOU MADE ME REALISE HOW FUCKING AWESOME I COULD BE. I'M GOING TO GET HOME FROM WORK LATER AND I'M GOING TO OPEN THOSE BOOKS AND EAT THE WORDS WITH MY EYES.

THEY WILL BE DELICIOUS. 




 I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE ANY REGRETS OR ANYTHING

BUT I SIGNED UP TO A GAME DESIGN COURSE _AND_ A COMPTIA A+ **AND** NETWORK+ COURSE

NOW 
I NEED MOTIVATION TO PICK UP ON MY COMPTIA

I'M PROPER SLACKING, LIKE.

TL;DR: *YOU LAZY FUCKS*

CAUSE I'M IN TOO DEEP, AND I'M TRYING TO KEEP, 
UP ABOVE IN MY HEAD, INSTEAD OF GOING UNDER.  




 Not entirely sure, but my reasoning is the "flat" is all on one floor. Some flats are in converted houses, some are in high-rises. I think Apartments might be reserved for the high-price range stuff. 

I drive to Manchester sometimes and I see "apartments for sale" signs, but driving through my hometown, there's "Flats to Let" above shops and in house windows. 




 I posted this vid on my G+ profile and eventually went off on one:

I don't mind it, but it appears to have infected most FPS' games that hit the "mainstream"  I might enjoy the occasional interactive-movie-like game, but sometimes I just wanna get chest deep in a game and spend weeks playing it.

Borderlands 2 is my crack atm, got like, 6 hours and I'm only scratching the top.

FPS' are the most immersible game but breaking flow so often really pulls you out of it. I like to call Single Player "Multiplayer Tutorial" 

MoH: Airbourne was pretty fun. You were given objectives and given an choice of 3 landing zones, though you could just fuck 'em off entirely and land where you like.

Obviously that was dangerous and you'd be on your own. No linear paths to follow, just a huge map. Do the objectives, lead into a single "end-level" objective, mission done 




 Almost time for hometime here.

I'm in my new job and I actually have my own desk.
Not a shared desk.

It's _my_ desk.

It feels awesome.

[](/wahaha)**FRIDAY!** 




 FRIEND

DID YOU JUST MOTIVATE YOURSELF?

MY WORK HERE WAS DONE BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN 




 THINK OF IT THIS WAY PAL

THAT THING YOU WANT TO DO TOMORROW INSTEAD OF TODAY?
WHAT IF SOMETHING PRETTY IMPORTANT COMES UP? NOW YOU HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS IN ONE DAY

NOW I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO PULL OFF MIRACLES, TWO THINGS IN ONE DAY MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR YOU TO HANDLE

BABY STEPS, FRIEND. DO THAT THING, DO IT NOW.

THAT REALLY IMPORTANT THING? PROBABLY GETTING RUN OVER BY A TRUCK, OR MAYBE GETTING MAULED BY A VICIOUS TIGER THAT ESCAPED FROM THE ZOO

DO IT. YOU MIGHT DIE OTHERWISE. 




 Hm, might take you up on that! Although I don't get paid until thursday..

I'll give it some thought and get back to you! :D [](/ajhappy) 




 The guys are saying December 15th, but that's subject to possible change. 




 I have no idea.  I can get the info for you if you want? [](/bonbon) 




 We're a rare breed indeed.

There's another meet scheduled for December, if you want, you can get a ride with me if you're near manchester or live near the M60 (north) or along the 62! 




 I'm sure there's a bunch of Bronies down there too! I have some friends in Bristol and they go to meets occasionally.. 




 That was the intent. Someone put a fez on him, then the fuzzy hat came, then all of a sudden:

"TF2!" 

hats come out of everywhere.

[](/ppboring) 




 Do it filly! We have a laugh, and I break everything the group stands for by being the resident Lancastrian who just turns up, hangs about, drinks, dances, then bucks off back to Manchester 




 well. Beer, alcohol, whatevs.

I was on shots and cocktails all night, but I'm a cider guy. Kopparberg is delicious. 




 It was awesome. It was my 6th meet, 5th with these guys, they're awesome! 




 Spilled beer. I spilled my Derpy shot. [](/derpwizard) 




 Beer, hats, internet. 

I was lucky enough to get a hold of the portal gun.

Lets just say that night, only one or two people were sober, out of the 30-ish people who carried on to the bar. 









 GSRM - Gender, Sexuality (and Romantic) Minorities 

OP put it in the original post, I didn't know of the term either until I read this the other day 




 Yes I know, I took this on a potato.

My hair isn't normally this straight, I just got out of the shower, it's normally just a little curlier though.

I usually just tie it up in a ponytail, because I love whipping it out at gigs and having a good ol' headbang 









 HEY LISTEN

YOU KNOW WHEN THE ZOMBIES COME AND YOU WANT TO BE OUT THERE SURVIVING AND KICKING ASS AND STUFF

YEAH WELL BEING A LAZY BUTTHEAD ISN'T GOING TO GET YOU ANYWHERE

RUN LIKE YOU'RE BEING CHASED. PRETEND YOU'RE LEVELLING UP FOR THAT BIG BOSS FIGHT THAT YOU JUST KNOW IS COMING UP AROUND THE CORNER

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE
THAT FAT GUY WHO DIES FIRST, OR THAT AWESOME HERO THAT SAVES THE GAL AND PROCEEDS TO HEROICALLY POSE, AND WRITE A BOOK BASED ON HIS ADVENTURES AND GET MONEY

REAL MONEY 




 Oh my god

That reminds me when I used to do distance driving from Manchester to London for work.

winter was the best, used to pull up at Norton Canes services and grab a peppermint mocha. Tastes like christmas! Sat in a freezing cold car park, slightly warm van, tasty-as-shit minty coffee in my hands.
