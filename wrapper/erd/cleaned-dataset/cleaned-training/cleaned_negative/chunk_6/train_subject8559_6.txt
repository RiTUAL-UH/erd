 It looks like a publicity shot for an upcoming Lord of the Flies remake 




 I played Countrstrike on dialup in australia and it didn't lag as much as this game does. Mind you I am playing against a friend who sits in the room next to me :S

 I can understand why people like it, but not why they rave about it. 




 420 volts 














 My gaijin understanding of it was that disrespecting a senior isn't forgivable in any circumstance.

 No more than posting to r/gaming turns a person into a domestic terrorist. Of all the top posts featured on R/all, one wouldn't reasonably expect an over representation of self mutilation given the subs purpose.  




 A girl at work told me homeless people choose to be homeless and she thought I'd agree because we work in finance
