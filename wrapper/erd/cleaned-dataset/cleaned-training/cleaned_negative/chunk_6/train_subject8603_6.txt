 The 2nd girl's cheerful "Hello :D" really makes it for me.

 This exactly.  




 I'd recently had my car totaled and found a new car to replace it, and financing it through USAA. After dealing with a few snags, it finally came time to do a title transfer from the dealer to myself, but with my mother as the cosigner on the car. The Leon County tax collectors required an original signature, but seeing as my family lives on a Navy Base in Italy, that process would take a couple of weeks to resolve. My parents are getting a power of attorney for me to complete any transactions requiring her signature be on the actual title, but seeing as how even priority mail might not get here for at least a week, would a photocopy of the POA provided by Naval Legal suffice for a title transfer into my name?

**TLDR: Is a photocopy of a military power of attorney viable in Florida until the actual document arrives about a week later?** 




 I somehow knew that this exact gif would be here.  




 It had to be done. http://i.imgur.com/q9aV7.jpg 




 Hoof it down to Mcdonalds or Subway and mix sprite and blue powerade. It is a close approximation.
