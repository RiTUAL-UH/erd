 The answer is a resounding 'maybe'. 

Like so many science things, there isn't yet a clear answer...but it does appear that, under certain conditions (like dehydration), the urothelial cells that line the bladder can express "aquaporins". Aquaporins are essentially pores in the cell wall that allow movement of water across a cell membrane. These are the same kind of pores that are in the renal tubules to allow reabsorption of water in the kidney. 

But, a lot of the work examining this is in cultured human urothelial cells, and bladders from rodents. More work needs to be done to see when and if these aquaporins contribute significantly to water or sodium reabsorption from the bladder. Truly, there has been a lot of interest lately in the role of the urothelium in regulating bladder function, and it appears that it isn't just a barrier that's impervious to urine like we originally thought.

 This is taken directly from [rediopaedia.org](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/endometrial-thickness), a site designed to assist radiologists and ultrasound technicians:

In premenopausal patients, there is significant variation at different stages of the menstrual cycle.

* during menstruation 1,4: 2-4 mm
* early proliferative phase (day 6-14): 5-7 mm
* late proliferative-pre ovulatory phase: up to 11 mm
* secretory phase: 7-16 mm
* following dilatation and curettage or spontaneous abortion: 5 mm, if it is thicker consider retained products of conception. 









 Lyme disease? I can't imagine that any physician or hospital ethics board would let someone be put in a medically-induced coma for Lyme  disease...but I could be wrong.

The protocol was designed for Rabies treatment of patients who did not receive the Rabies vaccine in time. Rabies is an awful, awful disease that is nearly always fatal if untreated; thus why this experimental protocol was devised.

The theory (as I understand it) behind the protocol is that since Rabies super-excites certain receptors in neurons in the brain (NMDA receptors) to cause peripheral nervous system hyperactivity and death, if you were to induce a coma by blocking NMDA receptors with something like ketamine, you could prevent the autonomic dysfunction that usually leads to death and buy the patient enough time to mount an immune response against the disease. The coma also allows doctors to manage other effects of Rabies (vasospasm, sodium depletion, dehydration, etc.) carefully and continuously since the disease progression is slowed, and administer drugs to get the immune system going and/or antiviral meds.

Success still isn't terribly high (8% from a quick glance), but I guess that's better than the near-100% fatality rate expected without treatment at all.

I can't find anyone using it to treat Lyme; if you can send a link to something about that, I will try to decipher why on earth this might work for that disease...but it doesn't seem to make a ton of sense outside of Rabies.
