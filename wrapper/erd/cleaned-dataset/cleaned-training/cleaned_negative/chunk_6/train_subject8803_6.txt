 The neo tokyo remix of this song is one of my all time favorite tunes. (cant link from phone)

Original never dissapoints too though!  




 Even better than [this](http://youtu.be/tAHSPR1iY_0?t=2m37s) 




 Ha, i live at about a 5 minute bikeride from the ziggo dome! 

Sadly that is the bad part of the city :( 




 Met bier en Starcraft ben ik al een heel gelukkig man. 




 Oh wow! very nice to see this happening, I'll be there! 




 You can keep a close eye on [Ticketswap](www.ticketswap.nl) Its a safe(ish) website where people sell their tickets if they bought one but are not able to go. Other than that you can search for the facebook event, at most concerts there is someone who tries to sell their ticket (mostly last minute though and there is a possibility you get scammed) 

Good luck! 




 A shame i didnt see any of the last game, horrible lagg :( 




  Get a lock that is more expensive then your bike.

This is gold advice (but a bit over the top) you can get a really decend bike for 50-80 euro's (or 10-20 form a junk) and a really good lock for +-40. 

also, a bike stealing friend of mine once told me: "if your bike is not attached to something like a post or a rail with its lock, then its not locked" 




 This is more a question for /r/allthingszerg. I think you will get more response and constructive feedback than on this subreddit.

 Wow, where does the original picture come from? i had [this picture](http://imgur.com/boty6lO) as my phone background for the longest time but never knew it was from somewhere/something.. cool shop btw! 




 I was thinking why this line was so familiar to me.
It is actually used at the beginning of a PvP game of star conflict (f2p online steam game with spaceships), pretty cool! 




 Aaand save 




 Nice touch on the Pick of Destiny! 




 Wow, nice pickup for millenium! Hopefully he will now grow out to be the top Protoss he always looks like he is trying to become. gogo babyK!
