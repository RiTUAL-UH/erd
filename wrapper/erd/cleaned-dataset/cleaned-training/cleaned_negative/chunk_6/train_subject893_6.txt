 I can't take credit for the video, I just came across it the other day. 




 Damn those trucks are riding low 




 Anyone else like the board shape a lot? 









 He still couldve been injured. He landed on the bike so he'll be kinda cut up and have some awkward bruises for a bit. 




 Haha I still can't figure out of he's a cop or of he just wanted to join in  




 Daaaaaaaaamnnnnnn that's a lo. Did it fuck with your sleep at all? I can't sleep if I take mine after 1pm so I can't imagine what a 200mg redose would do to my sleep schedule 




 It doesn't turn at all. It's completely stuck. I've put about as much force into it as I can and it won't budge 




 What dose were you on? I've been on 150 mg of xl for about a year now and even when I was prescribed promethazine codeine by the student health center I never experienced any seizure symptoms (knock on wood) 




 I take this stuff and it's done wonders for me but whenever I plan to go out drinking or take adderall to study I skip my dose for that day. It definitely helps that I'm a bigger guy and my dose is on the lower end of the spectrum though. 




 They're just the standard muirskate bearings I'm thinking of getting bones reds though. The bigger problem is the stuck nut and I have no idea what to do about it. 




 Nope I'm in the dorms right now so all I've got is the skate tool muirskate gave me 




 Need a bit of help guys. It sounds like my bearings need to be cleaned and lubed as they're making sort of a *ssfiiiiiit* type noise but the nut on one of my wheels is stuck. I've tried to get it off like 5 times now and it just won't budge. The others move just fine. Any ideas? Should I just take it to a local skate shop? I got it off muirskate like six months ago  









 It's rare but it's not unheard of for people to turn violent during a road rage incident.

 Idk I saw a post on silverfish from about six months ago that seemed to indicate that they had ended production. And the funbox website is down so idk 




 I thought churchill stopped making those? Go ducks btw. I grew up in Eugene and moved to socal last year.

 It's short but it's really wide. It makes it kinda awkward to lug around 




 So I'm looking for another board to add to my quiver, and idk what to get. I'm looking for a lightweight portable campus cruiser that's under 26 inches, and this is going to sound kinda weird, but I want a small kicktail. Oddly enough the penny fits the bill but I want to explore alternatives before I settle on it. Pros for the penny are that it's cheap, lightweight, small, and smooth for its size.
 




 I mean it's not too hard.... I got most of my Karma in the first 8 months of being on reddit. 




 I never said I supported prism, I don't. I do however, support international surveillance programs. And that's where he fucked up. I would support his actions 100% if he had only released information regarding prism and similar domestic surveillance programs, but he didn't. He foolishly decided to release **classified** information  regarding **legitimate** surveillance programs on political and military figures in nations like Russia and China and Pakistan. That is where he fucked up. As I said, a right doesn't excuse a wrong. There was no reason that he had to leak information about legitimate programs. You and the hivemind seem intent on ignoring half of the facts regarding his actions.    




 Or they're realists that understand that you can be right and wrong at the same time. Stop sucking his dick and try to comprehend the fact that him exposing NSA spying on US citizens is NOT an excuse for leaking information about international surveillance programs. You are the epitome of the hivemind and it sickens me that people like you are so blinded by your own ideals that you can't understand that he majorly fucked up. Yes, he exposed a program that is infringing on our rights, but he also fucked up several legitimate programs. One does not excuse the other.  




 To say that he didn't commit espionage is a lie. American citizens can be charged with espionage against the US. There is precedent for it. And do you honestly believe that he didn't give Russia any of that information? How naive can you be? Russia isn't hosting him because they enjoy his company. Beyond that, an entity can be many things it does not have to be a country. 




 Gotta edit that. It's the definition of espionage. 




 That doesn't make it right, nor does it excuse him. Edward Snowden could've done what he did in such a way that it could legitimately be considered civil disobedience, but he leaked more than what was necessary for his cause. For that he is a traitor. There is no way to get around that. Edward Snowden is a traitor for leaking states secrets and then fleeing with that information to not one, but two countries that are in a quasi cold war with the western world. He fucked up. Simple as that. 




 Colorado? 




 Every force in the world worth their salt spies on each other. Every. Single. One. Russia spies on us, China spies on us, Israel spies on us, Pakistan spies on us, Iraq spies on us, Egypt spies on us, the list goes on. And we spy on them. It's how global diplomacy has worked since WW1. To think otherwise is foolish. To think that we shouldn't because we should set some kind of moral precedent is just plain stupid. For revealing the NSA spying on US citizens, maybe Snowden should be let off the hook. That's up to a judge and jury though. For royally fucking up global relations, and fucking the hell out of many of the CIA's legitimate surveillance programs he should face trial, and he should probably be convicted of treason and espionage. 




 We shouldn't be spying

Yes we should. It's  naive to think otherwise. The world isn't perfect and in this imperfect world exists weapons with the capability of leveling cities, states, even countries. It is imperative that we know what countries have what weapons, how stable their leadership is, and if they plan on using them. It's not a matter of morality. It's a matter of life and death. 




 I'm just going to copy and paste a response I used for another comment.

The problem is that he didn't just leak information regarding NSA spying on US citizens. If he did he might have a defense. He fucked up in a real bad way when he leaked information regarding US spying on foreign nations, which is legal under US law. Any "civil disobedience" defense he might have had went right out the window when he did that. When you expose classified info of surveillance programs designed to gather information about terrorists and hostile nations then you are, by the very definition of the word, a traitor.

 Those are the definitions that have existed since the laws are written. Regardless of how you feel about Snowden, he did break the law. The criminal justice system in the United States is not based on the court of public opinion, nor should it be. Tell me, if you truly believe that he should be found innocent, what should his defense be? You can't say that he didn't do it. You can't say that he deserves an exception to the law. What is the reasoning behind your idea that he simply shouldn't be punished? 




 Let's talk about this for a second. The legal definition of civil disobedience:

A symbolic, non-violent violation of the law, done deliberately in protest against some form of perceived injustice. **Mere dissent, protest, or disobedience of the law does not qualify.** The act must be nonviolent, open and visible, illegal, performed for the moral purpose of protesting an injustice, and **done with the expectation of being punished.**

Like it or not, civil disobedience is not a get out of jail free card. Otherwise anybody could commit any nonviolent crime they want in the name of ending injustice and get away with it. Snowden and his supporters should have absolutely no expectation that he will get away scott free just because he did it in the name of justice.

Here's the definition of espionage in the US:

The act of securing information of a military or political nature that a competing nation holds secret. It can involve the analysis of diplomatic reports, publications, statistics, and broadcasts, as well as spying, a clandestine activity carried out by an individual or individuals working under secret identity to gather classified information on behalf of another entity or nation. In the United States, the organization that heads most activities dedicated to espionage is the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

What Snowden did falls squarely into the definition of espionage against the United States of America. If he gets convicted it's not because he had an unfair trial. It is because he publicly committed treason and left a massive trail of evidence while doing it. 




 So you're saying that humans are the Americans of the animal kingdom?

 It's in Lane county and held just beyond Veneta on the highway between Eugene and the oregon coast. Depending on the town and county Oregon can have very lax laws regarding nudity.

 I will! If you don't mind my asking, what frat were you in? I'm sure you've heard that beta and phi sig both got shut down this year 




 I found the sister's Linkedin and she did go to UCSB which is a well known party school in SoCal so I believe him. 




 So have you gotten over the graduate depression yet? I'll play a round of snappa in your honor. 




 So I went to a pretty well known party school in southern California

I'm guessing UCSB  




 Muirskate is pretty amazing. They've always been very helpful whenever I had questions for them. The only time I've ever thought about going elsewhere aas when I found a board for $30 less on another site but it ended up being the same with shipping. 




 I'm in sb. Regional differences I guess.

 The only problem is the fine is obscenely high. Like 4 times what a high speeding ticket would be in the US 




 The roof above the rear seats has been crushed at least 2 ft downward. It could have easily killed someone. The only thing that would've saved the driver is that he drove forward a few feet. 




 Do you think the stock setup (paris 108mm street trucks w/ divine wheels) is better than what muirskate is suggesting (109mm independent stage 11 trucks w/ 60mm abec 11 retro bertZ's)? From what I can tell the biggest difference between the trucks is that the independent's will need a .25 riser pad to accommodate rhe wheels while the paris trucks are tall enough to accommodate the wheels without a riser.

 How do I get me some of this fancy alcohol infused tobacco? 




 Where do you live that experiences sand storms? 














 The RAs are aware of the situation and they say their hands are tied because besides the noise problems he's not actually breaking any rules. My only course of action is to file a "concern for student" report with the school which means they'll interview him and decide if he's in need of mandatory therapy sessions.

Most importantly of all, have you told your roommate his actions are unnacceptable? 

I have but he's one of those people that basically argues with you until you say something slightly contradictory and then he calls you on it and decides that he's one the argument. Talking doesn't help. 




 I feel sorry for him to actually. He doesn't know anyone so he has nobody to live with next year. But honestly, I think he just needs to take a year off and grow up a bit more before he wastes his parents money on another failed year. 




 He never showers.   -- Who the fuck cares?

I do because he smells like ass.

He gets bad grades." -- Dude, who the fuck cares?

I wouldn't if he wasn't constantly complaining about how hard it is to get good grades in college while simultaneously playing 70 hours of LoL a week.


"He doesn't have any friends." -- Dude... who the FUCK cares??

I do because  he is ALWAYS in our room. Literally the only way for me to get space from him is to physically leave the building.  




 I doubt it. During the same time period that coke had coke in their sodas it was a common thing in france to put cocaine in wine, and it was fairly commonly prescribed in the US.

 It's a secret but it's assumed by people that have gotten it that one is an OG. The problem is that only the one source grows it so you never actually know if you're getting the real thing, as evidenced by the [pictures of it on leafly](http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/khalifa-kush/photos). So consequently nobody can make an accurate guess since they might not even have the real stuff. 




 I don't think he personally cultivated it. I think he just chose the parent strains and a grower did the rest. 




 Mine is Khalifa Kush. My dealer sold me some stuff a few months ago that was supposedly Khalifa Kush, the strain that wiz himself designed. They say its not available to the public and the only way to get it is from wizs grower. Idk bout all that but I know it was fucking dank. 




 I believe that I remember reading somewhere that mosquitoes are so insignificant to the global ecosystem that they are literally the only thing on earth that can be made extinct with absolutely no repercussions. 




 So I have a roommate, I guess we will call him Matt. At first it seemed like I had lucked out with Matt, he brought a fridge, a microwave, and a few game systems. He mostly kept to himself and he was pretty quiet even when he was playing LoL with his friends from high school. He only played LoL in the common room too so it wasn't really a big deal. Well one day our suite mate invited some people over and they were hanging out in the living room so Matt asked me if he could play LoL in our room. I said whatever nbd. Fast forward two weeks and matt has pretty much stopped moving to the living room to play LoL (which he was doing more frequently at this point) and is basically only playing in our room. His volume is also increasing, he's laughing and yelling at his friends, making retarded nerd jokes, and getting angry when they're losing. His friend group is also completely dysfunctional so they're always arguing about some petty bullshit.  

Fast forward another three weeks and Matt still hasn't made any friends and frequently skips class for one reason or another so he is ALWAYS in our room. To top it off it turns out that Matt is a goddamn insomniac so after I tell him to shut up so I can sleep I still have to listen to him rapidly clicking his mouse (I once woke up to piss at 4 in the fucking morning and he was still just sitting at his desk playing LoL). He has also become loud to the point that on a nightly basis our neighbors or an RA is coming to our door to tell him to shut the fuck up. 

And if all that wasn't enough he has tossed personal hygiene to the wind. It's not uncommon for him to wear the same clothes for two weeks straight, now I know what you're thinking, that's gross for a shirt but it's not terrible for pants, well this motherfucker sleeps in the pants that he wears during the day. Yeah you read that right. This disgusting motherfucker sleeps in his jeans and his khakis. Just goes to bed, wakes up, goes to class, and repeats for weeks on end. I don't even know if he changes his boxers. What I do know is that he does not shower, like, at all. I know this because the cleaning people come once a month to clean our bathrooms and when they do that they take all of the shampoo out of the shower and put it on the back of the toilet.  It usually takes Matt a few weeks to a month to put his shit back in the shower. YES THIS DILLHOLE DOES NOT EVEN SHOWER ON A BI-WEEKLY BASIS. We started the current semester in early january and I know for a fact that he has not showered since the first week, so it has been OVER A MONTH since he last showered. I got curious last week and picked up his shampoo bottle that he has had since the beginning of the year to see how full it was. Almost completely full... Like it feels like it has been used twice. 

But wait, there's more! I told you how he is constantly playing LoL, right? Well it causes him to procrastinate, like a lot. He took 9 credit hours (with three classes) last semester (You're considered a full time student at a bare minimum of 12), and he was always complaining about all nighters. He probably pulled one all nighter a week. Almost without fail on a daily basis I would hear him complain to his friends from high school about how hard the workload is in college, and how much work he had to do, and then he would go and play LoL at least until I went to sleep at 1am. That's not all though, Matt somehow managed to get a C- in his Algebra class last semester (Yes you read that right too, he hadn't reached college level math yet so he was taking an algebra class to be eligible for college math courses), a low B in his History 101 course, and a B in his intro to art history course. Yes, with 9 credits, and one class that wasn't even college level, he managed to finish the semester with a GPA around 2.5..... and his excuse was that his teachers sucked.


Now you may be wondering, why haven't I introduced him to some people? Why I haven't I helped him make friends so that he would leave our place more often? Well believe me, I've tried. Matt will only go places with me if he has an incentive to go there. That means that he will only leave our place if there is an incentive for him to do so, which means he only leaves to go to class or get food. He has actually only left our room for something besides food and class three times this entire school year. Twice were with me. I've invited him to go with me to my friends houses and dorm rooms before and his response is that he thinks we're going to peer pressure him into drinking or smoking weed, I told him that if anyone did that we would leave right away. He said that I was lying. 

And that's Matt, if you're wondering, no he still has not made a single friend to this day, and no he has not yet realized that he's disgusting.

**TLDR** My roommate showers once a month, wears clothes 24 hours a day for weeks on end, plays LoL on a daily basis with his friends from high school and yells loudly while he does it, and hasn't left our dorm room for any reason other than class and food more than three times this semester. 




 The worst part is that with this mentality they're going to go out and drive drunk again as soon as they get a hold of a vehicle without a breathalyzer ignition. I have an immense amount of respect for recovered alcoholics because a lot of them never learn. 




 That explains it. I think you're pulling the "overseas tourist" and underestimating truly how big the US is. You need that north south division or else things get all sorts of confusing. 




 It's true. I've found that very few people are truly ugly. It's definitely something that for the most part you can control.  




 Haha you guys have basketball  




 Nah bud is only sorta kinda legal here. It's oregon and Washington that has the legal recreational stuff. Now wait just a minute, let's not forget which USC is a div 1 football powerhouse and academically superior. 




 People that go to school in socal, such as myself.... 




 of course the apex dd is fragile. It's three ply. I agree that they wouldn't be my first choice but at the same time a lot of their boards are good for younger kids that want to try longboarding. 




 Why? Their videos have helped immensely with growing the community. 




 The other thing is that it's much easier for bikers to control themselves in a stop. Like once you enter a slide on a board then for the most part you're committed but the biker can brake and unbreak to swerve as needed. 









 Image sells. Have you ever noticed that he only does something douchey before an album or clothing line drops? 




 What, acknowledging that an artist is good means I'm sucking their dick? Do you realize that you're exactly like the "edgy" people from the past that hated the Beatles or elvis or sinatra or the stones or any other mainstream artist just because they're in the mainstream? The question is, are you "le wrong generation" edgy or "the only good music is stuff nobody has heard of" edgy? 




 Why would I shoot Kanye? Whether you want to admit it or not, he's an amazing artist. Who else has changed their musical style for every single album and still had commercial success with every single album? And the douchebag thing is an act. He's actually a rather intelligent and down to earth guy. [As evidenced by this video](http://youtu.be/MHSP8KuTa7U). 









 duck dynasty. It's shockingly funny. 









 Girls started acknowledging me! The first time I realized that I was starting to actually get fit was when I sat down to lunch and this cute girl at the table across from me smiled at me and started asking me questions about myself. The confidence boost is incredible too. 




 Two things,

I wish I had tried. I was one of those kids that was smart and knew it but was too naive to realize that I had to prove that I was smart to other people. By the time I realized that I had fucked up I was halfway through sophomore year with a sub 2.5 GPA. It was too late for me to get into a good school. I was just accepted into my dream school as a CC transfer. Yeah I saved a bit of cash, but I missed out on the opportunity to join a frat and I never had a true dorm experience.

I also wish I had played a sport. Once you leave high school you basically lose the opportunity to play a lot of sports. Most communities don't have adult (tackle) football or lacrosse leagues so it's really your only chance. 









 When I first saw the video I kept thinking it was going to kick him. I guess camels aren't as scrappy as horses 




 [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CyiJtp-B8g). The video is even worse because the camel keeps grunting and making terrified noises and the guys keep laughing. 














 People do amazing things in real life. They climb mountains that can kill you. They surf waves that are taller than some houses. They jump out of planes and fight wars. And believe it or not, some of them make enough money that to them dropping a grand is akin to you or me buying a friend a sandwich. The point I'm making here, is that you would be much less skeptical of things other people do if you weren't on reddit so much that you're using subreddits as hashtags. 




 I don't know much about the tech industry but I imagine it has to do with advancement in the company. Once you reach a certain level it becomes more valuable for you to know how to apply your previous tech experience to the business aspects of the company and not so important that you know how to do tech related things
 




 They were. This is saying that Vermont would be the first state to legalize through state legislature, which essentially means the decision would be made within the state government. Colorado legalized through a bill placed on the ballot, which means that they voted on it publicly. 




  Personal cultivation would be limited to secure indoor facilities.

So does that mean that you could only grow at designated "gardens" or you could only grow in your house? 




 I have the tugboat, love it. 




 Why? I support eating meat. I don't want to live near a slaughter house. I like boating, doesn't mean I want to live on a lake with speed boats going by constantly. I support air travel, doesn't mean I want to live near an airport. The all or nothing mentality you have is retarded. The fact of the matter is that windmills DO make noise, and they can be somewhat of an eyesore. I'm sure she would be happy to support the building of windmills in an area that didn't effect her neighborhood's scenery and property values.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?

 I just went with the number that yelp gave me but point proven! 




 So I'm currently a freshman at a CC in California and I love it but I'm not sure I want to wait another year before I can transfer into a University. I was looking up good econ schools and I noticed that IU has a pretty good econ program and doesn't require 60 credits before you can transfer so now I'm interested.

1) What is the party scene like? I live near the UC Santa Barbara campus so I can basically rage whenever I want and the alcohol is plentiful. Do you need to go greek to go to good parties? Do people ever just kickback and smoke weed?

2) If I decide to go greek is it hard to get into a top frat or are they pretty welcoming? I've got a lot of friends here that are Betas and ATOs and most of my friends from back home are Lambda Chis, idk if that would help me get into those frats but I've got that connection.

3) Is housing expensive? I'm currently paying $650 a month for a shared room in a 5 bedroom house so lower housing costs would definitely be a plus.

4) Is the econ program significantly more difficult to get into than the school itself? 

Thanks!

Edit:

Also the campus looks pretty big, how do people get around? Most people skate here but my guess is that you can't do that in the winter. 




 Because washington did it terribly and had a ton of hiccups in the process an there are only like one or two recreational dispensaries in seattle while denver has like 10.

 While I'm not in the marijuana business I feel I can give you some insight on at least some of this.

How did you maintain a continuous stock that likely includes several strains? 

Marijuana is semi-perishable, meaning it's not like milk but it also can't just sit on a shelf for a year. You'll want to utilize a "just in time" inventory. Meaning you only order more when your stocks are dwindling. It makes absolutely no sense from a business standpoint to have surplus inventory, especially if it has a shelf life.

Did you couple your business with other accessories such as glass, grinders, tobacco, vapes, etc?

Most dispenseries carry at least a few essential smoking supplies and devices; grinders for sure, rolling papers, some cheaper glass pipes, etc. With the existence of online head shops it doesn't make too much sense to carry high end glass because if anyone comes in to look at it they're probably going to end up buying it online for a cheaper price.

How much competition did you initially experience?

so far no states are letting you just open a recreational dispensery willy-nilly like you can with a convenience store. Dispenseries require special licenses that are handed out sparingly, if you can get one then it's beneficial because it limits competition. Unless your pricing model is so fucked up that people are willing to go across town to the other dispensery then competition won't be an issue for several years.

Was the business failure rate in your area following legalization?

Recreational dispenseries have only existed for about a year in two states. That data doesn't exist yet.

The second time was a few hours later and I took maybe 5-6 good sized hits and again didn't get noticeably high. This was good shit too, I gave some to a homie earlier this week and he got absolutely ripped. Any ideas why I wasn't getting high? I didn't grind my weed this time, I just ripped up the nug and packed it.

 So awhile ago I moved to southern california for college and I live really close to the ocean. Ever since the Idea popped into my head a few months ago I've really wanted to use a gravity bong in the ocean. Are there any dangers I should know about? I'm worried about pollutants, parasites, and bacterial infections mostly. 









 I mean if you want a bitch car then sure, go for the miata. Theyre completely different animals at this point. It's like comparing apples to oranges. The miata isn't fast. It's lightweight and fun to flick around out on a twisty country road. The new Z's aren't like their predecessors from the 70s and 80s. They're not fun little lightweight cars. They're big and heavy and better suited for a drag strip or a full race track than an auto-X course. If you want a fun lightweight car that doesn't have the reputation of being a chick car (cough miata cough) then look into the Scion FRS/Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT-86 (they're the same car just rebadged for different markets). If you want a convertible that's lightweight and fun as hell then hunt down a Toyota MR-2 spyder or a honda S2000. But unless you're trying to be mistaken for a 16 year old 90210 princess I'd avoid the Miata. I'm not trying to say the miata is bad by any means, but there are other cars that are a hell of a lot more fun that won't havd people making fun of you. 




 It looks like broccoli lol but its actually just ditch weed. Offer him $10. Honestly tho it's going to be too much trouble to pick out all the stems and seeds and leaves. 




 I've been wanting to buy a rig but grass city and a couple of my local smoke shops don't have more than a couple complete concentrate rigs and they have various pieces of rigs. Where can I buy a full and complete ready to go rig for dabbing?  




 How old are you? When I started college this last fall I knew nobody and my two roommates were the RA and this straight edge kid. Finally after about a month and a half I nutted up and told one of my friendish acquaintances that I was looking. He hooked me up with an eighth and after I passed the love around a bit I met three dealers and a few connections.
