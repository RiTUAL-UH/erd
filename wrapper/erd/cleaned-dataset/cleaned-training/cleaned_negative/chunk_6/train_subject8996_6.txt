 Haha.  














 Yeah, you got them. It's too bad the Browns 1.0 won it in Baltimore. 

 




 I couldn't agree more. Jason Kidd was a big one too.  




 Respect for the honesty. We all know the warriors fanbase doubled up recently.  




 Are you too young to have seen Charles sink that jumper in David Robinson's face?  




 I hope you're not also a Browns fan?  




 Me too! Stopped having the knicks be my east team after Larry Johnson left though.  




 Nash and Finley, you'r welcome.  




 you see him play before the knee injuries?  




 No Peja? Maybe a little Hedu? 

#whitechocolate  




 i'd still put  my money on the spurs

his suns source is probably optimistic more than anything substantial  




 Marcus Morris. Then he and Markieff would jump me and stomp me out cause that's how they do. 




 a great man with great news apparently  




 breath into a bag! 




 *then 

then it's the suns, not than 




 How are the Suns getting closer to signing LA?  




 chad's number was tweeted and he was going to get a new one in the episode but chad showed all the numbers of people who contacted him

so that's gotta be it 









 It has some business. Name one country where the government doesn't tell people how to live or what to do with their money. 




 More like Oliver Miller. 

And who is this 10 foot guy?  




 lol thx 




 thx 




 ur joke didn't go over so well lol 




 OHP? 




 Of course she's not, she's swimming in her big bank and big cable company money like Scrooge McDuck. 




 How good will the Spurs be with Duncan, Parker, and Manu retired?  




 For one year only, not franchise. Does the answer at all depend on the makeup of your team? Who are you taking? 




 It should have been dwight at 25 vs dirk at 35. 




 waiting for embedded episode 3.... 




 I want to see this version and the new one they put up later to find out exactly what they don't want us seeing.  




 Trump warned us.  




 It gets the 85 IQ Fox viewer voting. 




 Republicans won't get rid of it because it's worked. If they did get rid of it, millions of people would lose their health insurance, prices would climb drastically, and they'd get killed politically for it. They just want to complain about it. They don't actually have any ideas themselves.  




 actually they do! before the govt started telling people what to do they would die up in burning buildings 




 If by kook you mean in line with the majority of Americans more than any other candidate, then yeah he is.

Oh no, he wants more well paying jobs, a livable wage, healthcare for everyone, a little equality, and a strong middle class....how could we live with all of this? **How do we allow ourselves to live without it?** 




 Reebok: fuck you that's why 









 Diego would end up a bloody mess.  




 why don't you? 









 I can see that. Just put up a ton of shots. But how long can he stay healthy? I'm not optimistic. It's sad seeing him like this.  




 **Ben Simmons** 

You bet your ass they're tank! They won't be the only one either.  




 I hope they trade him away period.  




 If Kobe is healthy next year, what kind of numbers can we expect from him? 15/5/5?  




 nothing for miami or LA or portland? 









 so what about the other 35%? is that portland?  




 people are killing me with the 100% joke responses 

you're being sarcastic, right?  









 I didn't believe she wasn't  going to run for the longest time, but I have come to accept that reality the pat few months. I came over to the Sanders Bandwagon earlier this year and I'm glad to see him picking up so much momentum and I hope he can keep it going.  




 not in practice

rarely ever does the VP have anything to do with the senate  




 I hear that. Best wishes. Kick it's butt!  




 it's got what plants crave 




 treasury secretary would be dope!  




 Agreed. I love her as a senator though. 




 let's not be delusional lol 




 I told him to listen to my **mix tape** in a well ventilated area!  














 Bo and Deion did it. 









 are there any other resources you would recommend? I'd like to find something that groups medications by class (maybe with tables) rather than just a big list 




 oh, you're going to asu law school (sandra day O)? it is a great law school! congrats! 

can i ask what your gpa/lsat score was? curious what students are getting nowadays who  go there 




 tell that to republicans who vote down vets benefits  




 this is by far the most realistic list 




 I'm not doing it for the money lol. If I wanted money, I'd go MBA. 

That's good to hear about the connection just in case. Best wishes man! 

What attracts you to AZ?  




 got it, thx

So, if I'm an NBA player could I have a tiny little condo in the state of Washington to pay 0% state income tax? And then just live in other place? 




 That's good to hear. The money isn't what it used to be. You thinking of working for the govt / private? or going out on your own? 

Nursing. If I had to do it all over again I would have done med school, but I'm not trying to be in school another decade.  




 He'd be the centerpiece and #1 option on the Suns.  




 Bernie Sanders doesn't vote to go to war and then neglect our veterans like so many politicians. Bernie Sanders is the leader America needs.  














 double taxes or split up depending on where they play? 




 When it happened. 




 hahaha 




 besides just more, what's the  difference in toronto?  




 I think the Lakers got too much help from the refs for it to be coincidence. Statistically, the calls they got were outrageous. I think the game was fixed.  




 they're so incompetent Lopez will probably just elect to retire than play for either one  




 is Robin Lopez the Lakers Tyson Chandler?  




 lol 




 has he gotten better since he left the suns? because he was not good in phoenix  




 Refs stole game 7 from you! that wasn't right  




 92-93 Suns have to be up there 




 at least wait for LA to be signed 




 how can the republicans not be tire of this?  




 you gotta bring the heat!  




 i think hillary is more component than that

is there a top like a 10 somewhere of the funny/good stuff?  




 alright lol, we're gonna have to agree to disagree, but respect, you do you 




 F5 for Aldridge's selection.

 Name me 3 good songs of hers  off the top of your head besides rehab?  




 there's no room for the "truth" in mainstream media  




 copy paste the text on top of the story on google and then go to the result and you get the entire story!!! very quick way around that paywall 




 I have. I still only like this one song.  














 PoliSci, plan was law school. Worked at a law firm, then later at the court. Dragged my feet for years, and since the legal field is dying somethin' fierce, I decided to go into healthcare which I'm pursuing right now. What are you thinking of doing? Criminal Justice field? Legal field? If the latter, I would advice you to be practical and look into it and be 100% it's what you want, because law school is not a good investment anymore. Back in the day (say before 2006ish) there were many well paying jobs out of school. Now, even people out of Ivy league schools in the top 10% of their classes are struggling. Partnerships in law firms are diminished. Plus, keep in mind something 90% of lawyers don't see a courtroom. They're in the office 12/hours a day doing paperwork. 

I think choosing something that will get you a well paying job out of school is the best route to go, regardless of what you want to do after your undergrad, be it law or something else. So if you did engineering, accounting, nursing, computer science, etc something practical like that, you'd still have  something to fall back on. 

 




 +1 

And there is already enough hype. It would be a waste and it might actually take away from what they currently have.  




 ASU grad here, what are you studying?  




 Choose your fighter: 

select player 

it should say select fighter 




 Rehab was her only good song. She's very overrated. If she hadn't died, everyone would have forgotten about her by now. 









 most likely [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmZp8pR1uc) 














 **select player**

they give so little fucks about the fighters they can't even change the word player to fighter  




 I hope he plays a bad guy. It's way more fun and a better part.  




 usually something comes up automatically that allows me to translate, it doesn't here, i don't know how to translate it  














 for what? they can't double team stomp people out? this is the NBA, teams are not obliged to keep you together, it's a luxury/privilege and they don't deserve it 




 why only one year? why not 3 or 4? 




 which one? i don't speak Portuguese  




 my f5 key is more worn out than Kim  




 The early Amare was the best, but after he busted up his knees he was never the same player. As a person, he's overly materialistic. I couldn't be a fan of a person like him since I can't relate to him.  




 Based on the median age of MVPs it seems unlikely. If he does it will most likely be in the next season or two. 




 I feel bad for Mark that he has a snitch in his family. The shame. 




 This can be arranged.  




 no idea what you're talking about 




 tldr 




 i always wonder what the curve is for players, some of them are as good as they're ever going to be after one year, but some of them take a few years to start ballin'  




 someone will get hurt, someone will start playing bad, it happens every year 




 29, lol 

seriously though, when is he making up his mind? tonight?  




 why does everyone assume all the teams are staying the same? some will get better and some will get worse. You never know, you could have like seeds 2-6 all be within a game or two of each other and phoenix gets hot and end up getting the 2nd seed. You never know bro. 




 You're kind for saying 4-6 instead of 6, thank you. I'm sorry about Amare.  




 is warren ready?  




 Lakers should trade Kobe to a contender and get something for him, and rebuild.  




 Oh, I see. And I respect that, I was just curious because I have known people who are trans, but never anyone personally.  




 Lakers are back in the race! 

For the 8th seed. 




 LA   NY must be really toxic organizations  




 can someone measure traffic this way? I think we'd have the highest posts on avg that way 




 surprised we're so low, i am guessing we just talk the most?  




 and you're now on a list 




 This would kill the NBA.  




 you guys are getting screwed by the back room draft lottery too

usually by that many years of sucking you'd have a few studs
