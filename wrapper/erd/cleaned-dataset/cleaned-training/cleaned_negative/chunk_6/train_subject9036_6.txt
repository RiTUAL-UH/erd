 Campbell Hall doesn't exist at the moment, so in fact your method is quite difficult.  




 I'd guess it's about 50/50. I got in from number 23 I think last year but I don't know how many more people got in. I can't imagine a ton. Great class though. If you don't get in this semester, definitely try again next fall.
