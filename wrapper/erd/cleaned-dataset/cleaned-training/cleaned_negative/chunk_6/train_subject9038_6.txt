 Never thought of the guild thingy. Will do so. I hate being serious in a guild - that's the problem. Right now I am in 2 guilds. Both of them are pretty serious but I said to the main guy that I won't be serious and I will be more like a representative of those guilds. If they want they could kick me - they didn't do so. 




 One word: IKEA 




 OMG This is Beautiful!!!!
