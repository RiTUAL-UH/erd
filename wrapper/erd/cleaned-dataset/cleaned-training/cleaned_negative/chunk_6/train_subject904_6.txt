 I just wish I could've found a black armband rather than yellow. 









 /r/thalassophobia is what you are looking for. It's a subreddit dedicated to your fears. Don't feel bad I have it too... 




 I have it. Yesterday i was in the deep water, and I *dropped* my paddle in the water. I watched it sink, and was too scared to try and get it. I was out and stranded... The deep areas do a real good job of giving me anxiety attacks. Ive had two half panic attacks when a shark came out of *nowhere* and I just could not climb back into the raft.
