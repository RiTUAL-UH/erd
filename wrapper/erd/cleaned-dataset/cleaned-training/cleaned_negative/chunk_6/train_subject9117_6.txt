 Hi there Canadians of Reddit. I'm a 23 y/o Australian and I'm thinking of moving to Canada for work. I am working for a mining company in Australia and have a Trade certificate as a Mechanical fitter and machinist. (I fix and maintain fixed plant machinery) I was just wondering if there are any jobs that are similar to mine in Canada. any help would be greatly appreciated.
