 May Kirito be with you. 
























 I'm getting tired of the usual cliches, so I'm looking for new ones. 




 I want to watch a movie with my younger brother. I can't watch R-rated movies with him (and he won't watch them), so I need to go below that. I would like to watch something that's intelligent or emotional this time, not really dependent on action.

We've already watched: E.T., A Beautiful Mind, Jurassic Park. I think we've both watched Spider-Man. 


































 Inverse of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/39ze0v/what_bad_anime_has_excellent_source_material/), because I'm not interested in reading good source material.
