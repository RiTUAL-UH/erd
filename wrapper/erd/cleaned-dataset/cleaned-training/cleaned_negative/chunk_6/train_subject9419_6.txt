 That's a very disparaging characteristic. Some of us like Bernie Sanders as well as Hillary Clinton but find that both of them align with us politically about the same, despite some rhetorical differences in spelling it out. So, if that is the case how do we choose who to support? Their views aren't enough if they align practically the same, as is my case.  




 I don't understand this idea that the media somehow is against Sanders? Don't they love competition in order to increase suspense and thus ratings? That's their main goal, I thought. They did that in the 2012 election; making it seem like Romney had a bigger chance than he actually did. And I've definitely seen Sanders mentioned on CNN and MSNBC. Hell, Rachel Maddow has clearly not hidden her admiration for him, as have other hosts.
