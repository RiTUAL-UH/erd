 Have you ever read 'The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'? 




 Why did you decide to write on the Dhammapada? 









 I'm sure a) its age doesn't affect its truthfulness 

b) it continues to reach new people each time it's posted

c) it is just as important now as then

Propaganda = that which is to be propagated

Of all the things deserving to be propagated this is right up there, IMO.

 I'm know I'm more likely to go out and spend money when it's light out in the evening than when it's dark. I guess that'd be the same for others too. 




 So your 11pm figure was a bit off, wasn't it? On balance and in the round I think the changes would be a very sensible thing. 

Look at the charts at the bottom of this page to see how many more hours of sun the changes would provide: http://www.lighterlater.org/benefits.html.

The UK isn't nearly as blessed as Portugal is in these matters.

 How are you working that out?

 **Keep clocks forward to boost health, say experts**

Permanently moving the time zone forward an hour would encourage children to do more exercise, according to a study that has revived calls for Britain to ditch Greenwich Mean Time.
MPs, scientists and charities argue that putting the country on central European time would have significant benefits for public health, road safety and the economy.

The main proposal is for Britain to have the clocks two hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time in summer and one hour ahead in winter, giving people more light at the end of the day throughout the year and effectively placing the country in the same time zone as France and Germany.

The idea, known as Single/Double Summer Time, would give people about 200 extra waking hours of daylight each year. It has broad support among backbench MPs.

Rebecca Harris, the Conservative MP whose private members bill for a review of Britains time zone was defeated by a filibuster in 2012, said that there was a strong case for bringing new legislation after the general election in May. Its certainly possible that perhaps in the next parliament it might be picked up, but there are already campaigns around the country trying to get it into various political party manifestos, she said.

When my bill was going through the Commons it had considerable cross-party support. The big health benefit was seen as being having an extra hour of daylight in the evening when children and adults are more able to make use of it for extra recreation and being outdoors.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative backbencher who helped to filibuster the bill, said: That we tried it before and reversed it [between 1968 and 1971] and Portugal did the same indicates that people do not like long, dark mornings. Essentially, there is not enough daylight in the winter and muddling with the clocks wont create any more.
Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Bristol found that children in nine countries got more exercise when sunset was later.

Shifting Britains time zone to match other western European 
countries would lead children to do two minutes more exercise each day on average  an increase of 6 per cent, they said.
Anna Goodman, the lead author of the research, which appeared in the International Journal of Behavioural Nutrition and Physical Activity, said:Introducing additional daylight savings measures would affect every child in the country, every day of the year, giving it a far greater reach than most other potential policy initiatives to improve public health.

Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said that the idea should also be revisited for its environmental benefits.

A separate study published today suggests that seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a form of depression that affects sufferers acutely during the winter, may be more widespread than thought.

In a YouGov survey of 2,000 people, 8 per cent said that they had clinical SAD, while a further 21 per cent said that they suffered from the condition to a lesser degree. Previous studies have put the level at between 3 and 4 per cent. In all, 57 per cent said that their mood tended to be worse in winter.

Lance Workman, professor of psychology at the University of South Wales, who oversaw the research for the Weather Channel, said that SAD could be due to mankinds poor genetic adaptation to living in northern latitudes. We havent lived at these latitudes that long  only 50,000 years  so we may not be particularly well adapted to winter.

Ms Harris said: A lot of people wrote to me saying they suffer from SAD, and they would much rather have the extra hour in the evening.

 Yes. And how do you define 'my'? 




 Cool. Artaud served that function for me. 




 In the light, the earth remains our first and last love. Our brothers are breathing under the same sky; justice is a living thing. Now is born that strange joy which helps one live and die, and which we shall never again renounce to a latter time. On the sorrowing earth it is the unresting thorn, the bitter food, the harsh wind off the sea, the ancient dawn forever renewed. With this joy, through long struggle, we shall remake the soul of our time. 




 That white looks very clean. 














 Notwithstanding the violence, maybe there's not all bad with drugs and religion. 




 Yep. That's how I read it at least. 




 The filming of Tennant's Hamlet didn't do it justice. 




 Go read the essay "how many children had lady macbeth"

Yes do. Still fresh after 80 years.

The essay "How many children had Lady Macbeth?" does not attempt to answer the question it poses. Not in the literal sense. What it does attempt to answer is in what sense it is appropriate to answer in when 'answering' Shakespeare. 




 It's about grace.  




 Extraneous question-mark? My advice for your acting would be to be certain in regards to your character's certainty. Or otherwise... 




 Living people once bestowed 'honour' will soon attract critics - detractors - therefore it is impossible to have honour whilst living. 'Suffer' is used in the sense of 'abide' in this instance. 'Detraction' is used abstractly for 'the capacity for detraction amongst men'.

Falstaff's argument is that honour is useless to the dead and impossible to maintain for the living - thus a flimsy 'sticking-plaster' and not a thing of substance. As a shield's ornament ('scutcheon') is to the shield itself so is honour to virtue. Therefore Falstaff'll have 'none of it'. 

Addendum: My sentence concerning 'virtue' may appear to some to overreach the content of the speech. I'd however argue that Falstaff's sense of virtue is intermingled with his sense of pragmatics. 




 The 'y' in 'dayes' evokes the wistful day-time moping ('why, why, why') of the ruminating day-dweller. 

The 'i' in 'daies' evokes the eye that sees his love at night in dreams.

Shakespeare's sonnets are worth reading that deeply.

 I don't think that's true. 




 In the US, federal maternity leave only applies to women that work in companies that employ 50 or more people (not to mention other restrictions). The "50 or more" benchmark applies to most state leave benefits, as well.
Now how many businesses employ 1-49 people? According to census.gov, it is roughly 4.5 million (http://www.census.gov/econ/smallbus.html[1] ). That's not 4.5 million individuals who do not qualify for leave, it's 4.5 million businesses. If the US workforce is somewhere around 156 million, this leaves a HUGE chunk of women (if not the majority) with nothing but the mercy of their employers.
Trust me, I've looked in to the situation. I am one of the women this affects. I am the sole female in a 10 person tech company. First pregnancy in the company's history. I get nothing.
EDIT: btw, I should have started out with the fact that the federal leave most women aren't even entitled to is totally UNPAID!!! It just guarantees that your job will be waiting when you get back 12 weeks later.

 Astonishingly, *Comfort Food* was only written because the project [Jamie] Oliver next intended to work on  a book and TV series on vegetarian food  was rejected by Channel 4. It seems incredible that any channel would turn down a Jamie Oliver project, given what a powerhouse of sales he is: 2012s *30-Minute Meals* became the fastest-selling non-fiction book ever published in Britain. Hes not exactly the Swedish Chef from *The Muppets*.

Although Oliver himself was surprised  The public, more than ever, really want to eat more veg  his final reply belies someone with a fortune of 240 million and one million subscribers on Food Tube. Its fair enough, he shrugs. Channels have got their own thing to worry about. And you know what, if I did 130 five-minute veg videos over the course of a year [and put them on Food Tube], thats probably what Ill do. I was gutted, he adds, but Ive done most of the hard work, and itll happen at some point. The books on top of a cupboard somewhere. Waiting.

On the first day of training, I didnt start the session that well and he tapped me on the shoulder after a half an hour. He said: Are you alright? and I replied, Yeah. And then he asked me: When do you start training then?. That put me under pressure straight away...
