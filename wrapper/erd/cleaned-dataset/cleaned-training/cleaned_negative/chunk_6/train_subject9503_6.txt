 [Absolute Beginner English](http://esl.about.com/od/teachingbeginners/a/ab_beg_intro.htm) may have something you could use. 














 I didn't at all mean to imply the person's evaluation changes.  Just that tense they use might.  Make it about the meal instead of the restaurant.  Would most languages make the shift from **I like** to **I liked** at the same time? 




 Two weeks!  Stay three months in NZ, join a [hostel network](http://www.bbh.co.nz/) and really see the country, both islands.  You won't regret it.  Then spend three months in Oz.  You'll barely scratch the surface of Oz in that time. 




 What an amazing lack of appreciation so many of these comments display for any sort of notion of the common good.  It's entirely possible to want less wealth inequality because of something other than wanting to take your money and put it in my pocket.  As though an increase in wealth equality takes something from you personally without giving anything back.  How about being able to live in a country with less wretched poverty? 














 I had no intention of doing a corpus study.  All I want is to see whether knowledgeable people have commented on this phenomenon, if it exists.  This is a mild curiosity of mine, not something I can justify with evidence. 




 I have an intuition that languages differ in their criteria for switching from the present tense to a past tense.  For example, when does 'I like this restaurant' shift to 'I liked that restaurant'?  Just before leaving, just ourside the door, after arriving home?  

Not knowing how to characterize this so as to research it, I keep running into prescriptive advice not to employ tense shifting, along with explanations of the various uses of tenses.  

My notion is that English is quicker to switch to a past tense than many other languages, such as possibly German, Spanish or Japanese.  How do I go about investigating this on the internet? 




 I recommend watching [Griefwalker](http://www.nfb.ca/film/griefwalker), a film that may transform your relationship to death and dying. 



















 I'm a Stein voter and it worked well for me.  My 1/129,064,662 of a cent went to the person I preferred.  I wouldn't have done that if I weren' t voting in a state safe for Obama. 



















 I recommend checking out [praise effort not ability](https://www.google.com/search?q=praise+effort+not+ability aq=0 oq=praise+effort+ sourceid=chrome ie=UTF-8) 




 Meant to use this full title:
The 40 Year Recession: The Modern Economy's Long Downward Spiral | How the "Long Recession" led to the "Great Recession" | "Between 1971 and 2007, real hourly wages in the U.S. rose by only 4%.  (Thats not 4% a year, but 4% over 36 years!)" 









 Oh come on, you can paint with a more delicate brush than that.  I'm writing from Michoacn and there's plenty of peace here. 







































 Pretty much everyone calls SS entitlements but it would be fairer to call them earned benefits.  The entitlement comes from their having been earned. 























































































































 I understand that Social Security is an earned benefit, so it's puzzling that you characterize social insurance as "redistributive". 







































 Yup, that's the point of the article. 













































































































 Well then, good luck to you. 


































 There aren't a lot of photos of that kind on my subreddits, but I am bothered by sexist comments when I see them.  I'm also amazed by the comments here by those who don't notice it or don't care.  But then I'm an old geezer. 




 I just recently stumbled on the work of [Stephen Jenkinson] (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=23 cad=rja ved=0CNYBEBYwFg url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.matrixwissen.de%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D703%3Astephen-jenkinson-culture-of-dying%26catid%3D118%3Ageschichte%26Itemid%3D98%26lang%3Den ei=ic0EUbmEK6jyigLuhYDoDg usg=AFQjCNGkomT_ohOGokpFWiaZItc1Bs8THw sig2=ldTK4Bm0_yjgABW4Tj2ElA bvm=bv.41524429,d.cGE) and I was blown away by the power of the guy and what he has to say.  Though everyone from 8 on up should hear him speak, I believe it has special relevance for you, both for yourself and for your relationship to your mom.  Uplifting and inspiring thoughts on a topic our culture considers a downer. 




 I don't see how you get *sole providers* out of that quote, or the article as a whole.  Anyway, chacun  son got. 




 From the article:
... men obviously also suffer violence, largely at the hands of other men, and every violent death, every assault is terrible.  But the subject here is the pandemic of violence by men against women, both intimate violence and stranger violence.  

Is this focus not allowed?  What makes it out of line? 




 This is a subreddit for discussion and conversation concerning the topics of equality in all subjects (such as racial equality, age equality et cetera) but mainly focusing on sex/gender equality.


So I didn't think it would be out of line. 



































































































 I've been buying [Acer Aspires](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_st?keywords=acer+aspire qid=1358283439 rh=n%3A172282%2Ck%3Aacer+aspire sort=price).  Good value. 




 There are lots of [online sources](http://www.darntough.com/online-retailers.html). 









 A Unitarian Universalist community would provide a moral education and a respect for world religions without inculcating doctrines. Many UU members are atheists. 




 Not mine -- it's from the article, which is worth a look. 



















 There are some interesting comments on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5054618). 



























































 The the *overly non factual editorialized title* was supplied by The Guardian.  I agree that it's a distortion of progressives' views.
