 Powerful Joe Rogan.  














 [It was called AIPAC: The Israeli Lobby] (http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/aipac-the-israeli-lobby/), and it was a great documentary. 




 They will ban you and then accuse you of having an agenda. 

I got banned there for questioning why the mods removed my documentary critical of the Israel Lobby. The mods reactionary response was to accuse me of having a malicious agenda. When I responded by saying that their censorship of my submission was the implementation of an agenda on their part I was banned instantly. I tried appealing but with little success. It seems like they have a narrative there that they don't wish to see disproved and that agenda would appear to be:

Arabs = the Terrorists 

Israeli's = the Victims of Arab Terrorism  
























 ThinkProgress must changed the title of the article at some point today after I submitted it to /r/politics. When I submitted the article, the title *was*,  "*Private Prison Corporations Spent $11 Million to Lobby For More Aggresive Immigration Policies*"

Do you think you still have to leave it removed ? Is it possible for you to leave the submission up and flair it something to the effect of "Title changed" ?  




 This is a great article. 

NBC News is such an utter shit show.

This completely dwarfs the Brian Williams scandal. Richard Engel is complicit in implicating the Assad regime and the Iranian government in his kidnapping during a time where US intervention in Syria was being debated in Congress. Engel absolutely knew that this would sway the American public in favor of intervening in Syria on behalf of the "moderate" rebels.  




 Please stop violating rule #1 of the sub. You can make your point without the racial slurs. Another comment like this will result in a ban. Thank you.  















































































 This will get downvoted out of easy visibility. I submitted a similar article and it didn't stand a chance, it was downvoted immediately after it was submitted.

 It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.  



















 Yea, I banned him for having no account history except for attacking other users on this thread. After I banned him for accusing a user of hacking into TimesofIsrael they threatened me and deleted their account before I could respond in kind. 

He's a real fucking nut and now that he's deleted that account he's probably here with an alt account now in a different form.  




 **TOM COTTON'S 3 STEP PROCESS FOR SUCCESS IN IRAN**

2. ?????

3. Profit 




 All I know is Anthony better be logged in to his Reddit account for the funeral of the sub. 

I swear if Anthony's not here for the funeral of the sub I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive him (*sniff,sniff*), **period**.   









 Well Opie definitely strikes me as someone who likes to dole out ultimatums to people, because he enjoys having leverage over people in uncomfortable situations, be they professional or personal.  



















 This is a very serious issue that deserves careful consideration, and I expect to have a classified briefing in the near future, Schumer, who is Jewish, said in an emailed statement to Politico, the website reported on Monday evening. I strongly believe Congress should have the right to disapprove any agreement and I support the Corker bill which would allow that to occur. 


































 No wonder management likes him so much.  














 With the overall fan base, yes. 

With the Pests here on /r/opieandanthony, no.
 
Too much time has passed, it would be awkward now. The Opster certainly wouldn't get any solidarity points from me. 

B4 Ant got fired I foolishly thought these guys had each other's backs. Opie exposed their friendship for what it really was, they were good work friends and nothing more. 

To Opie, Ant is no more important than the person that you linger at the water cooler with to talk about sports and shit.  




 Yes, and you can endorse inherently racist policing practices, it won't change the fact that the majority of people aren't racist and won't condone institutionalized racism the way that you just did.  




 "I endorse apartheid"
 - /u/br0keit 




 Yes.  




 "redditor for 19 hours"

Nice try Opie. 
 




 I read this in Ant's voice, and it was awesome. Especially the 'Christ ! Even the Rolling Stones held it together'  
































































 Removed, rule 1.  




 "The report prompted a massive manhunt and topped the evening newscasts, even as a global nuclear deal with Israel's archenemy Iran was being announced."

They are attempting to keep their own citizens fearful of Arabs/Iranians/Palestinians. Elements within the Israeli defense department, most likely Mossad, don't want average Israelis to feel that bilateral progress was being made in the region with a treaty. This hoax topped the evening news in Israel, relegating the real story, the US treaty with Israel's nemesis Iran, to minor coverage, prioritizing it to a lower status than it truly is.  





























 Well it was filmed in LA and he's got a prescription. 




 "It appears Velentzas eventually became suspicious of the undercover agent's identity, allegedly using her phone in November and December to access webpages with titles like "Learning the Identity of a Confidential Informant," "How to Spot Undercover Police," "Is S/he an Informant?" She also researched how to detect bugs.

Yet she and Siddiqui continued to meet with the agent in the months that followed. Siddiqui purchased several propane tanks and stored them in her basement, and discussed them during the meetings. "I got everything up in this joint, I already told you. If you guys... once we learn... I got everything up in this joint," she allegedly said. "Yo, she got everything. This is like the Home Depot," the undercover agent responded."

 














 Thank you, this submission title is very misleading and I don't think OP has a very good grasp of the situation in Yemen. He seems to be conflating the Yemeni government which was recently ousted by the Houthi rebels and said Houthi rebels.   




 Are the Houthi in charge of the Yemeni military ? No, they are actively fighting the Yemeni military, there is an ongoing power struggle taking place here. To say the Yemeni government is gone and the Houthis now undeniably control Yemen would be inaccurate at best. 

Also I can't find what your title is iterating anywhere in the article you linked to, so there's that.  




 This title is misleading. If Saudi forces continue to bomb the Houthi rebels in Yemen, then *Houthi rebels* and not the Yemeni government, will launch a ground offensive against Saudi Arabia. For one thing, Yemen's ousted governments are the ones asking for Saudi intervention, to say that Yemen is going to invade Saudi Arabia is misleading to say the least.

You can't equate Iran-backed Houthi rebels to the Yemeni government and military.  














 TY kind sage.  




 Solid Coke plug on that surfboard. Amazing picture like that, and all I can concentrate on is that Coke logo. Way to ruin an otherwise great pic.  




 In the picture on the left, Jupiter looks like the Moon from the Smashing Pumpkins, *Tonight, tonight* video.
