 I've never backed anything on kickstarter, so I'm not sure how it totally works with the add-ons. I'm looking at backing Trickerion, but I'm wondering if I need to. I'd love all those stretch goals...do stretch goals normally go into the production or are they exclusively to kickstarter backers?

 I dig Trajan a lot. It scales well from 2-4 and I think different strategies are highlighted with different player counts.

 I was at the house of a friend who has two boys: a 4 year old and 18 month old. The 18 month old waddled over and open hand smacked the 4 year old in the back of the head. Dad yells at him to not hit, 18 month old waddles over to Dad, and with a sad face puts his arms up to picked up. Dad picks him up, kid open hand smacks him in the face. 


Later that day he took the kids to a play place for kids. They have a big sandbox there. 18 month old would go around and throw sand at all the boys and kiss all the girls.

 nothing in this has anything to do with social awkward or awesomeness.

 oh good grief...lying??? He's telling a specific story of Chris Kyle. If anything short of telling the entire story is a lie than every movie should just be a 400 hour documentary of whatever war they're focusing on.  




 I don't see here what makes me wrong. I was reacting to 1. the quote in the link trivializing and marginalizing soldier's emotions and reactions to war; and 2. on why the movie was and to what aspect of war it chose to focus on. I never said that war movies have no affect on their audience. That's an entirely different debate of whether that is a responsibility film makers should choose to bear or not. Similar to 'athletes have influence on youth, thus they should be required to act like a role model' whether that athletes cares to or not. Clint Eastwood wanted to make a movie about Chris Kyle's life. What people think when they leave the movie is up to them. But it's not wrong to make the movie.  




 Unless this was your ex's shirt or some custom mall t-shirt with a spray painted caricature of the two of you banging that she got for you, this doesn't matter at all.   




 Then I suggest you spend a day at a facility that treats soldiers with injuries and PTSD. Try telling one of those people who put their life on the line to do what they thought was right in fighting terrorists that they're "warmongers" and undeserving of empathy.  




 That's fair, but it doesn't really say anything about slavery or black history month. Whether a slave owner treated slaves with kindness or cruelty is like saying a murderer tortured his victims first or executed them with a painless lethal injection. It's wrong either way.  




 "Wrong people" is a completely subjective opinion. The director of this movie wanted to focus on what a soldier (who I'm pretty sure is an "actual" person) goes through, so he focused on exactly the right person. There are other movies that focus on the citizens of a war torn area. If you prefer those, that's fine. But don't say something is wrong or broken because it looks at an immensely and impossibly large scope through a specific lens to tell the story they want to tell.  




 well shit...someone direct me to the burn unit 




 Welcome to 5th grade french class. 




 This again? Shit like this comes up every war movie. Remove the political biases from it and whatever motives governments may or may not have had to enter a war and continue a war. It's a movie. Soldiers enlist for many different reasons, and during their service, yes, things "make them sad" and a million other feelings as well. Humans enjoy seeing stories about the human emotion; at heart we are empathetic creatures, and are pulled to stories that pull that out of us. People like this "comedian" are infuriating.

 I live in Buffalo, NY so I have some insight. Buffalo has an insane amount of infrastructure to prepare for winter conditions. The city and each surrounding town has an incredible number of plows and salt storehouses. They can clear highways and main roads in no time. 2 feet of snow on a Tuesday night? Bet your ass you're going to school on Wednesday morning. 

Other cities just don't have the infrastructure for it and, just as devastatingly, people don't know how to drive in the conditions, which clog up roads so those few plows that do exist can't get through. It basically comes to cost for these cities: is it worth it to purchase millions of dollars of plows, storehouses, salt stock and pay workers for the 1 storm a year or every few years? Generally, no

 What? Yes they did. They got the top forward. If/when they finish last year which is extraordinarily likely, they are guaranteed McDavid or Eichel 




 Would this be good to listen to as an audiobook? 




 I'll take that bet everyday of the week. I will also take the team with the #1 farm system in hockey, is about to get McDavid or Eichel and didn't just trade away their only talented forward. But way to come in to another city's sub, politely chime in with your thoughts then turn into a dick when you're rebutted. That'll work out nicely for you in life.  




 hahahaha. Good luck with that. Enjoy the next time you lose your franchise.  




 It's the price of doing business. We're not trading the lottery pick. We have 3 first round picks this year. The other two we got from the Isles   Blues. Those will likely be very late picks. We're giving up the lowest one.  




 It's definitely a lot. But there was a lot of teams calling for Kane. Make a move to get your target, I guess. Trades are usually at a higher cost when it's not right up against the trade deadline. I'll miss Armia   Lemieux, but I think we have enough similar guys to fill in fine 




 But enjoy Armia and Lemieux. Both will be fun to watch. Armia should be up, in your top 6 next year. Has grown a lot this past year and is, by all account, a great kid. Lemieux will be a solid 2nd or 3rd line power forward. Loves to hit and has good hands. 50 points and 120 PIM in 46 games in Barrie this year.  




 Boston said the same for Seguin. He's doing ok for Dallas. 

And regardless of where you stand in the trade, if you think our GM and brass didn't do proper research when pulling off a trade like this, you're delusional. Is it a risk? Maybe. But "attitude" stuff is so overblown. Seguin got run out of Boston because he partied and supposedly had a bad attitude. If Kane scores 30 goals, I don't care where he travels to.  




 From a quick google search...Places with NHL Farm System Rankings:

Sabres #1 in all of these sites. 




 You know the farm system isn't just Rochester, right? The Sabres farm system is ranked #1 in the NHL right now in terms of prospects. Sam Reinhart, Justin Bailey, Hudson Fasching, JT Compher, Connor Hurley, Mark Pysyk, Jake McCabe, Johan Larsson, and until today Joel Armia and Brendan Lemieux.  




 Nope, I like it. Our farm system is loaded with talent on the level of Armia   Lemiuex. And we got proven elite NHL talent in Kane. You have to pay for that. Hurts to send away Armia   Lemieux, but that's been the plan all along. Acquire as many prospects and picks as possible and use those assets to trade for proven young talent and get as close to the top of the draft as possible. Elite talent wins.

 How is the pit? Too close? Looks like it's only rear balcony, or the pit or way off to the sides in the lower area 




 I was looking at tickets for upcoming shows and I was wondering about seat suggestions. There's nothing available in the front orchestra areas, except to the far sides. There's a few in the pit, the "loge" and then rear balcony. I'd go for the pit, but I'm not sure if that's too close, like sitting front row at imax?

 **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** is loads of fun. I like it better than Suburbia as it's less fiddly without the population/income tracks   checking other peoples' towns. Plus the theme is great. Castles are awesome! And the Master Builder mechanic adds some nice depth and strategy to it. Easy to get to the table, easy to teach and fun to play for newbies or experienced gamers.


Of everything you listed, **Dominant Species** would be the hardest to get the table. It's heavy and a really long game. Can easily be 4 hours. 


**Terra Mystica** might be hard if people aren't into heavy games. This game is heavy. There are a lot of rules and sometimes they're a bit scattered in the rulebook. That said, it's #2 or 3 on bgg for a reason. It's a masterpiece of a boardgame. Everything works together wonderfully, it looks incredible and has loads of replayability.


**Machi Koro** is definitely light, but it is fun. If you get this, get the Harbor Expansion with it. It evens out some of the OP strategy. 


For Co-Op, you can't go wrong with Pandemic. It's a classic, and you can uprade the difficulty if you want to to make it more challenging. Same with lots of Co-ops.  




 Well, which is it? Are you suspicious or are you him? 




 At least in America, I find far too many dry scrambled eggs. People leave the eggs in the skillet, still, as they harden, then they flip and break em up a bit, like they were making a diced omelet. For me, the key is to constantly keep stirring them. Keeps any part from cooking too long and ensures optimal moistness throughout.

 I've heard the new expansion rewards large spread footprints for end game scoring so races that tend to have smaller settlements like Dwarves or Engineers are at a bit of a disadvantage there 




 So what does that mean if you have them in the box? Just throw them out? 




 Yea, a bit. Still a risk/reward of driving someone up on the price I guess. Are the designers working on any rule changes to balance it out? 




 Seems the Shapeshifters are the one imbalanced thing here. Does the bidding balance it out at all? 




 This is the only time I've ever heard something negative about the expansion. I just picked this up now as TM is my favorite game. Only things I've heard is that this takes a great game and makes it even better.
