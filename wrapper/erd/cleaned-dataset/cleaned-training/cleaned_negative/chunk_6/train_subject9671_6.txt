 That...is a good question, upvoted to find the answer. Interested in seeing gay guy's perspectives on this. 




 House M.D. and Scrubs.

Scrubs has got some great feel-good stuff going for it, but House REALLY knows how to set the right music to a mood. 




 You got some weight on them there shoulders buddy? Feel free to PM me if you want to vent :) 




 She's priceless!

In all seriousness, she's not "mine" to sell; you'd have to ask her for a definitive price. 




 Make a homeless person's day - go out, find a likely prospect and invite them to come for a hot meal. Spend that $30 on a cheap, warm meal for them, and sit and chat with them for a while.

It'll feel very rewarding, and you'll literally make their day. 




 I'd KEEL YOU, infidel!

 This, both of these. My girl just loves the effort, that I thought to think of her. That's what makes it special, remember, not any amount of money, gifts, food or cards - that YOU thought of HER. 




 A phone call to tell my girl that I love her.

Yeah, I went there. 




 The only chair free in the entire form room was with three other boys...they'd been friends together since before primary school, and I was the odd one out, within an hour I was "one of them", and by the end of the day I'd assumed general "leader" of the group. That was fifteen years ago, I'm STILL absolute best friends with them all (not so much leader now, but more decisive decision maker when they're all uming and arring). 




 A quick way to make money without working, selling myself, my girlfriend, or anything I own. 




 Being a newb to competitive generally helps, though it has come in handy once or twice! 




 I always go down on my SO and rub her clit (quite often at the same time) and/or include G-spot stim with two fingers BEFORE we go anywhere near intercourse.

After two/three goes (sometimes she works her clit for me), we switch up and we have sex. Occasionally she'll orgasm from this penetration but only after cumming the other way first.

This wasn't always the case- she faked it for a long while at the start of our relationship, but once she had owned up (she was hesitant to tell me that she only ever came through clit stim usually), she taught me how she usually did it, and viola! Satisfaction every time.

I guess the ethos here is communication. 









 Hey all, after mucking about and not really getting anywhere properly on here, I've bumped to OU to learn the ropes. I've kept this team on the books for when I know what I'm doing better. In the meantime, I've got an OU RMT going on here; http://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/2uyx6c/rmtou_rate_my_team_please_also_suggestions/

 




 So, brace yourselves, this'll be exhaustive. I've literally started competitive yesterday, so I'm learning in process. After some mucking about in UU, I came up to OU (being the standard smogon tier) to learn with a greater range of Pokemon to choose from. I created a team, as best I could, trying to cover weaknesses and give a good spread. Here it is;


My original team, "1.0";


Uluru (Tyranitar-Mega) @ Tyranitarite

I put this together with Sandstorm in mind, giving a couple of non-sandstorm Pokemon to balance. Mamoswine would lead, cast stones and then I'd roll with the punches as best I could. Here's the five battles I had with this set-up:


1.0 Battles

http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208667959


Of course, if you watch those you'll see I didn't get pretty far (there are probably those of you who could have predicted this before even seeing the battles). So, I made notes as I went - I had nothing to dish out fire, no water, no grass, no psychic. I also had no hazard clearer, as the eagle-eyed among you will have noticed. So I dropped Zapdos, it being the one Pokemon that ALWAYS failed, and felt wrong in the line-up, and replaced it with Charizard (with Y Charizardite). 


With a SpA setup, Charizard covered Fire, Grass, Fighting and a hazard remover tweak. I also dropped roost from Gliscor as it never got used with Toxic Orb and Poison Heal, and replaced it with Hidden Power [Ground], for STAB. Finally, with the fire covered by Charizard, I dropped Fire Punch from Tyranitar and gave it Aqua Tail, to give the team a water move.This resulted in my current team;


Current team, "1.5";


Uluru (Tyranitar-Mega) @ Tyranitarite
Ability: Sand Stream

So I have tended to lead with either Tyranitar or Mamoswine, though on occasion I'll get straight into sweeping with Charizard-Y. I've played ten full battles with this team, the replays are here for those dedicated helpers among you;

So far, so good. They're working well as a team, I think. Two of the above battles where I've lost I got distracted IRL, so can't complain about them there (I forget which two). Again, I've taken notes, and have the following to say;


- Defog on Charizard just isn't practical, I need another hazard remover


- Missing an Electric move (and some water types are getting away with murder once Charizard is out of the picture)


- Missing a Psychic move, and because of this Gengar is often being the key to unlocking my whole team.


- I NEED a stronger water attack than Aqua Tail, as Heatran walks all over me. See end of next point for potential solution.


- I didn't realise you can only one-mega-evol per battle, so I'm kicking Tyranitarite out, as Charizard is just so much better with his. Therefore I'm thinking of running Crunch in place of Dragon Dance and a choice scarf to make up for the speed drop. My only other thought on Tyranitar was to change him to a full SpA spec, with Surf/Dark Pulse/Earth Power/Thunderbolt.


Any help and suggestions would be great; as I said they all seem to work pretty well together, and have all had their moments pulling through for the team. I need to remember to not keep Tyranitar in against Fighting, as he sucks against them.

EDIT: Took out my suggestion of swapping substitute for Psychic, as it's an Atk, not SpA Pokemon, so that'd be stupid. 




 Well, for starters I'm trying to figure out how to balance a team...right now it seems every team I make it's very hit or miss.

So I guess to start with it's team building advice! 




 Hi guys,

Old-timer Pokemon player here (though not an actual old timer - only 25!), never really got into competitive before, but want to give it a shot. I understand most of the basic terms, but need someone to help me organise myself and address weaknesses and such (I know there are websites that show you weaknesses and coverage etc, but it helps to have someone knowledgeable explain it all to you as you go through it!).

For your information, I am dabbling on Showdown team editor, and am aiming for UU level.

Edited: Added in tier 




 Here it is;

Sir Reginald (Escavalier) (M) @ Assault Vest
Ability: Overcoat
Shiny: Yes
EVs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe
Adamant Nature
IVs: 30 Atk / 30 Def / 30 SpA
- Pursuit
- Megahorn
- Drill Run
- Iron Head

Frill (Vaporeon)
Ability: Water Absorb
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe
Calm Nature
- Scald
- Wish
- Baton Pass
- Ice Beam

Specs (Flygon) @ Chople Berry
Ability: Levitate
Shiny: Yes
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
Jolly Nature

Giggles (Darmanitan) @ Choice Scarf
Ability: Sheer Force
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
Jolly Nature
- Flare Blitz
- U-turn
- Rock Slide
- Superpower

Ice Cold (Cloyster) @ Focus Sash
Ability: Skill Link
Shiny: Yes
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
Jolly Nature
- Icicle Spear
- Rapid Spin
- Shell Smash
- Toxic Spikes

Naughty (Chesnaught) @ Leftovers
Ability: Bulletproof
EVs: 252 HP / 84 Def / 172 Spe
Impish Nature
- Wood Hammer
- Roar
- Synthesis
- Drain Punch


Escavalier and Vaporeon are the core - they don't seem to do badly in any of the matches I've played so far. Flygon is generally a great Pokemon, and Darmanitan/Chesnaught are both very hit or miss. Cloyster seems to get out his toxic spikes then die, so looking ideally for something more sturdy (also as he's part water he adds extra thunder/grass weakness to the team that already is there from Vap). 




 Ah, my thanks. 




 This is the team...

Okay so I've listed them in order of what's losing the most. Crobat and Donphan aren't helping at all right now, and Blissey isn't really doing her job. Vaporeon, Escavalier and Chandelure are rocking, but I need to change it up a bit. Any suggestions/advice?

Edit: Now chandelure isn't doing too great either. I really like him, but if he's going to keep failing like he has in the past few games, I want to just build my team around Vaporeon and Escavalier 




 Haha! Aww that's understandable, Pokemon IRL would be the best. Yeah, they are pretty cute - you must have loved Gale of Darkness (if you played it), getting to start with an Eevee!

Ooooh you did!? Can I ask to see a pic/pics without seeming creepy? :P 




 1. That's awesome.
2. That's also awesome.
3. Boo! Umbreon's the best! ;) But fair enough, to each their own. 




 Not in the literal sense, obviously - I mean look through their submitted/comments sections to get a better idea about them? 




 Species: Lorikeet

Age:?

Sex/Neuter status:?

Breed: Lorikeet

Body weight: Overweight (in comparison to other Lorikeets that are around here)

Clinical signs: Overweight belly, ruffled feathers, doesn't close its wings fully once it lands, has a piercing shriek cry instead of the chirrup/whistles that the other lorikeets do.


Your general location: Sydney, NSW, Australia

(It's one of a flock of wild lorikeets that often come sit on/near our veranda ledge - flock is about 10 in total I think?) Have only been here for a little under two weeks, but have heard it's odd cry the whole time I've been here, so I'd imagine it's unlikely that it's changed condition anytime since. 




 I'd have an Umbreon, if any. It's my overall favourite pokemon and eeveelution - couldn't stop playing Pokemon Coliseum (Gamecube version) 




 1- How did you decide on the order/placement of them, or did you ask the tattooist to work it out?

2- Are you having them 'actual' colours, or slightly odd/off/different tones to the 'classic'?

3- Which is your favourite (that's right, I asked it!)? 









 Says the person calling OP a man... 




 How do you keep track of your submissions? I mean, some stick with you really easily in your head, but as for others...how do you remember what stories you wrote for which anthologies/magazines, and when they were sent off etc?

I'm starting to get this problem, so wanted to get some ideas before deciding on a system for myself to use! 




 Will have to look into this then. Thanks for the recommendation! 




 A generation ship (I'm not sure if that's the correct term but it's how I know of them) is a spaceship designed to hold thousands of people (or millions, maybe), and for each subsequent generation born and raised on the ship to take over running/maintenance of the ship, to enable humans as a race to a) travel farther without going faster than light (because we don't know for sure if this will ever actually work) and b) survive beyond our own planet/system.

What problems do you forsee that a generation ship would face (I'm thinking serious ones like radiation exposure or food supply, rather than say alien contact) and, if you can think of any, what solutions would you present?

My favourite one is oxygen, and I put forward the idea of massive forest rooms/levels dedicated to creating oxygen/taking CO2. 




 I don't think we'll be travelling light years very fast any time soon. Travelling them in normal time? I'm for the concept of a generations ship, similar to what they ended up with in Wall-E but without the AI robots, laziness and death of muscle/bones. 




 Chest tattoos on a woman.

Probably get some hate for this, but I really don't like them at all. Just my personal opinion. 




 Also, would you mind if I used it as inspiration for a short story I'm writing? 




 Which is better, or is it best without either? (for your teeth, obviously) 




 Gotta say, love the name. True spirit of our sci-fi culture mixed into our space-faring future. Have some adoration. Keep us posted on the details of the mission (don't suppose you have a link to somewhere where we can follow/subscribe to updates about it do you?) - what is the mission's name do you know (if it's not the same as your craft). 




 Don't know if anyone has shared this already, but it's a darn awesome watch.

Kudos to the creator.

 I always have the heat up so high that if I do, I get light headed and close to passing out, so no, you are not the only one who enjoys masturbation-free showers... 




 Snowballs? 




 My five questions.

1. How much did you know about A.K.A. Jessica Jones before you heard about the production?
2. Did you apply for the Harper role, or did you go for another?
3. What other Marvel character would you like to play (or would you like to have played, if it is an already-cast character)
4. Your most well-known role was as Trinity in The Matrix trilogy, did you enjoy making these films?
5. What was your favourite part of the Matrix "journey", whether that is a particular scene, character, funny backstage moment, crew member, whatever?

I'd give a Reddit gold to anyone who can help set this up. 









 Sorted.
