 My daughter is almost 2 years old now and I absolutely love spending time with her. I always look forward to how happy she is to see me and seeing her. The way she lights up when we play together and even when I just talk to her. 

All of that makes the time spent with her worth it. I'm not sure why your husband would be so detached but perhaps it just takes a while for some people to warm up to the idea of having children. Maybe it has to do with how he was raised. Simply my thoughts but I am in no position to make assumptions. 

In the end, I love the time I spend with my daughter because of what she gives back to me.
