 Rates of thickness change (m/decade) are color-coded from -25 (thinning) to +10 (thickening). Circles represent percentage of thickness lost (red) or gained (blue) in 18 years. Only significant values at the 95% confidence level are plotted (see Table S1). Lower left corner shows time series and polynomial fit of average volume change (km3) from 1994 to 2012 for the West (in red) and East (in blue) Antarctic ice shelves. Black curve is polynomial fit for All Antarctic ice shelves. We divided Antarctica into eight regions (Fig. 3), which are labeled and delimited by line segments in black. Ice-shelf perimeters are shown as a thin black line. The central circle demarcates the area not surveyed by the satellites (south of 81.5S). Original data were interpolated for mapping purposes (see Table S1 for percentage area surveyed of each ice shelf). Background is the Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (LIMA).

 Welcome to the Anthropocene 









 But there are five Guardians of the Galaxy. I suppose RR, being compact, doesn't need a seat? 




 I'm content to let her live the rest of her life in an Alabama state prison and be buried in the prison graveyard.

Revenge is tempting but won't bring the girl back. There's too much killing already. 




 In the meantime you've got apocalyptic movie sets. 




 Just a bunch of sea critters all mashed together, after all. Metamorphose it and you've got real value. 




 You are an excellent parent. 




 A very clear, easily understood exposition of the wankel engine. I only wish they had shown how the motor is cooled. 




 Put your back to the bike when you pick it up. 




 The food at Starbucks is crap, too. I hadn't eaten at McDonald's in years and gave it a try in a wee town in Utah last October-not advocating everyday, mind, but it got me down the road. Like the folk at the McDonald's better, too. Kids having fun relaxes me. 




 [Superstore's](http://www.motorcycle-superstore.com/11321360/d/motorcycle-helmets-for-kids) offerings 




 I prefer McDonald's coffee, which is surprisingly good. 




 Always loved early Floyd best, and this truly weird piece made for interesting *visualisations* 









 Nice, but I've always been partial to [Judy Collin's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zp8xUAO7Hs) rendition. 




 It was hard for me to stomach his support of the PIRA, which he eventually renounced. May Ireland be whole one day, but by peaceful means. 




 Quite right, but his early career was certainly British. LAMDA, West End, Warner Pathe  c. *This Sporting Life* was his first starring role, produced by the Rank Organisation.

 *Inferno* - Circle 6 - Canto 10: Farinata Uberti, a heretic, addresses Dante and Virgil. The two were political enemies in life, and when the Ghibellines, of whom Uberti was a leader, won the [Battle of Montaperti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Montaperti) Dante, a Guelph, was exiled.

 This "lyric rhapsody" never fails to move me. It was commissioned by Steber, and the libretto is excepts from the preamble to James Agee's *Death in the Family*. Barber and Agee were alike in many ways, and both used an improvisatory method on this work.

 It's discouraging that when commenters are anonymous the interwebs seeth with racism. 




 Those of us who've lost bikes might feel like shooting someone in the head, although that would be a horrible, inhuman thing to do.

Damn I still miss that K1 




 '60-inch cyclotron, 1939. This shows the cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley, soon after completion in 1939. The key figures in its development and use are shown, standing, left to right: Dr D Cooksey, Dr D Corson, Dr Ernest Orlando Lawrence (1901-58), the inventor of the cyclotron; Dr R Thornton, Dr J Backus, WS Sainsbury, Dr LW Alvarez (1911-88) and Dr Edwin Mattison McMillan (1907-1991).'

 Rocky Rococo! 














 *Bike* (UK) is distinctly different in this regard. Their reviews are not like a recanting of a sales brochure; there is actual *criticism* (the horror!) and yet they somehow stay in business (just published their 50 year anniversary issue). 




 Just like all American motorcycling publications 




 Summer, in a park, in Munich. The horror. 




 This is why I live alone in the bee-loud glade. 




 Shoot. I did a karmadecay and reddit search, nothing turned up. Would not have posted if I'd known. I posted the title that accompanied it on the website I found it on.

 Now I know what (   ) means. 




 Codified law and collective governance were made practical, and there was rhetoric, theater, engineering and art. The standard of living even for slaves could be better than those across the Rhine, and a slave could become very wealthy, and free. 




 But that's not why the Romans were so successful. The lands the assimilated were Romanized, and those who lived there liked it. Remember Maximus in *Gladiator*? He was from Hispania. Eventually even Emperors came from former non Roman lands: Marcus Aurelius - Gaulish and Spanish. 




 Yes. They probably all "lost" by day 2. 




 Check with Mdecins Sans Frontires. They still have operations in Haiti. 




 It's hard to disagree. Certainly those single individuals had an enormous influence on so many lives throughout history, but the structure of modern society is so strongly shaped by Roman precedents. America's founders took as their model not some religious ideal, but a Roman one. Washington was the quintessential Patrician. 




 Ain't reddit grand? We have a real informational gold mine here. Between reddit and Wikipedia there is so much groovy stuff to find out. And do you like the Engineerguy? He did a great presentation of Michaelson's [Harmonic Analyzer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAsM30MAHLg)

 An inclined plane is one of the six [simple machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machine). (I'm guessing the cone and the access cover are not the deflectors.)

 Vets Hospital I worked at in the 80s had a fair number of Oglala men from South Dakota. They wouldn't mix, bad blood. 




 I was agog after seeing *Billy Budd* when it first came out. If you haven't seen it take a look. There were a lot of great Brits in American films in that era-Burton, O'Toole Harris, Harvey-and Stamp seemed to disappear. For me he didn't really make an impression again until *The Limey*: "You tell him I'm coming!" 




 I liked him in *Major League*. I hope he gets his shit together.
 




 I like the counterweighted doors around the top of the sphere.  




 Used to be Bull Bear people (Pine Ridge) didn't get on well with Red Cloud (Old Smoke/Rosebud) people but maybe they've buried the hatchet by now. 




 Mixed feelings about that. It's a damned shame that we waste so much of the nation's treasure on something that doesn't help the citizen, like a bridge or a school.  But we'd be fools not to let the world know we will defend the nation-and if need be, on our opponent's land rather than ours.

I do believe that if we need such a weapon that we invest in one with such capacity and durability as we have here.

And of course I can't wait to see her at sea!
