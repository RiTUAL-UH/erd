 They'd love your input at the github portal for the law, I'm sure. 




 Thus keeping most cases civil instead of criminal and the law organic through judges rather than regulated by legislatures. It will be nice. 




 From at least the perspective that humans are rational and have natural rights which extend from their capabilities rather than their needs, yet a government has to impose force to curtail those rights in favor of the needs of other humans for the purpose of civil society.

Society can be civil without central government, but people have a hard time imagining what it would look like since it has been so long since any group of people has lived like this. In the end, there is no central government tying the entire human race toether so we are all effectively anarchists, anyway.

 except they aren't even on the island - they are on Serbian territory waiting for Croatia to get its head outta its butt. 




 It just took a while to [type out](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/38jawf/im_the_president_of_the_liberland_settlement/crvkyex), I guess. 




 truck nutz. but the post before made me think of switching them out in the story. 









 How, when the cartels flip politicians and police - or do you contest that? If you do not, then guns come before political control. 









 This makes me imagine my high school art teacher walking out with bolt cutters to a drafting table sitting in the student parking lot with the table tilted up so it is visible through the big wall of windows on the art rooms, snipping the chain link, and walking back into school with an entire project folder full of McMansions which go directly into the trash.

I grew up in East Coast farm country. The poor pickup truck didn't even get a treat after being neutered. 




 So better for the builder, worse for the buyer? 




 Chop the bottom half off and we have an accord. 




 It is telling that instead of considering whether people should be paying taxes for this or not, you went straight to talking about how goosenecking money through administrative channels should not be forgotten when considering how people will be forced to pay for their healthcare through taxes, as if that was terribly different from being forced to pay any other way.

*The simple fact that healthcare is perceived, by you, like a universal public service instead of a commodity is really something.* I'm very interested that your reasoning is not purely ideological at the surface, and I have to agree with what you say in many ways.

But it is the way America has treated it's healthcare and nutritional guidelines which is horrendous. People treated healthcare like a public service and the public servants got it wrong (as humans are known to make mistakes and/or be corrupt). One set of rules across the country and a news service to back it up then made sure that nobody was breaking dogma and getting away with it. If deciding how to treat the sick and feed ourselves wasn't managed on a national level, we'd have shaken off our stupor by now through competition and offering more options. Instead we basically became a technocracy on the mental and nutritional health fronts for eighty years. The externalities of poor decisions in these areas is extremely dire, no doubt, but would not be so severe at the present period if the incorrect funding levels, subsidies, and programs had not been held above competition. Long before now, the evidence would have made it clear mental patients needed more supervision and less psychotropic drugs, saturated fats and cholerserol are not evil and are not well managed by statins, and the general state of medical insurance is a gaping wound in American finance practice no matter which way it is looked at.

I'm not going to say I haven't looked at the data, not that I should know exactly which data you mean from the perfectly broad statement, but why would data make anything more clear given what we agree on? You don't know me, but I have listened and read up on the different views.

What we have is a difference of philosophical opinion, and I'm not sure you accept that, nor understand the consequences.

You are opining government is the best and only way to provide healthcare, it seems. I do not share that conclusion. The place we really disagree is probably the definition of rights. I want to know how you think a democracy can operate when that most basic of assumptions is contested?

And, btw, you never asked me to "question the claim stated in the last statement of your first paragraph." I asked you a question and you obliged. Thank you for that. I kinda riled you up. I wanted an answer so I did that on purpose. Rand used very strong language, and was ultimately making a flawed argument as it is heard in the [video.](http://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/diverting-non-urgent-emergency-room-use-can-it-provide-better-care-and-lower-costsd) I just found the entirety of the video and will be reviewing it. Without the context of philosophical matter supporting it and cushioning it, which I am not sure he even provided in the hearing, the argument is laughable on the face. That doesn't mean the statement he intended was, necessarily. 









 It is very early, but what kind of plans does the LSA think they will consider approving for development once recognition happens?

Where is that discussion taking place? 




 And believe it or not, the Catholic view is that it is not a disorder. 




 Is this where I call you a bigot for not respecting my personal views and the way I live my life as a Catholic? 




 As a Catholic, he is right on.

Ever seen [The Third Way?](http://www.blackstonefilms.org/thethirdway/) 




 Well it looks like all these organisations have a stock in supporting it, but Hopkins doesn't have a stock in not performing ops. 




 Next trailer, probably. 




 Well you not approaching this in an open and academic way isn't exactly convincing. Rand's position was ill stated but is easily explained as half a duality of necessary restrictions to providing a service by force of law. Either the service is forced to not be paid for the trouble, or the customer is forced to pay.

Way to miss that, Mr. Grad. Waaaaay to go. 




 Until people teach their children or themselves otherwise, that will be the case. Same with Russia. The prison is in the mind. 




 Everyone plays their part. Not every ISIS member needs to be an American, emigrate, or work in online forums to radicalize people. 




 I still think you don't, probably. Take the recently reposted video where Rand and Sanders debate mandatory healthcare. Is Rand's position incorrect (granted he did not relate it fully and clearly)? Rand said doctors would basically be slaves.

 Should we just sticky this to the top, already? ;] 




 For some, both.

And by that I do mean the people using the excessive powers our various levels of government have from outside any elected body. Unelected officials, lobbyists, and cronies use regulations and law against competitors and against the people.  




 Denmark: High public trust. The Royal Family knows the country doesn't have a stable future unless the economy improves or some austerity is implemented.

Sweden: History of economic conservatism. The boat is slowly turning back that way, as well. Last decade it became apparent in policy circles that the honeymoon with socialism was ending.

Norway: Can you say oil? Oil.

To note how much these populations still pay in taxes is to realize how much the socialist state requires. Factor in the differences between us and them and you see the price would be higher here. More cronyism, more economic stagnation, less oil per capita. Americans are not prepared to give that much - just like our government is not prepared to handle it. 




 Those are the ones I am talking about. They are either floating on natural resources, a history of laissez faire, or is one of the few countries that actually has a different level of public trust and lacks potent corruption from special interests.

I'm not counting dollar signs. 




 I was in traffic court (as a witness) yesterday. Has anyone ever used this to get out of a speeding ticket, I wonder? 




 The idea of subsidiarity is to make each decision at the smallest level capable and relevant to the matter. Since fracking is accused of poisoning ground water the decision to ban may exist at the body responsible for that resource. 




 New polls have Rand doing quite well and he is also looking good for early primaries and caucuses. 




 Just because you don't understand his arguments doens't mean he is a loon. Plenty of people don't understand the more academic arguments Bernie makes and see him as insane, too. 




 You mean the ones with tons of oil which can spend oodles on state programs without having to tax people as much as we would? 




 So the UN should make vaccinations mandatory the world over? Why not let the states decide?

The other option is letting the community of insurance and lawyers find the right level of risk and indemnity. This will create a reaal price for going unvaccinated and will cause those people to self-select and make a value judgement on whether they want to live in the woods, alone, or in society with a vaccination. 




 So we should leave the door open both for civil litigation against people who are un-vaccinated (or the gaurdians of children who are) when contact brings disease and also the freedom for these fools to self-select and move away from contact. Why would they move away? To reduce risk of being sued. 




 Sounds like you have discovered that democracy cannot prosper when the basic structure of the law is contested. 




 This is why every marketing group needs an engineer or Army specialist to be a designated pun and acronym reviewer.

If it makes them laugh, it fails. 




 The NRA are also really ineffective. They basically collect dues and emails to lobby for the interests of gun-related corporations.

[The National Association for Gun Rights](http://www.nationalgunrights.org/) doesn't do that. They are oriented towards activism and real protection of rights. 




 Get back on the horse and try to think patiently and scientifically about what factors may be causing your hair to get more oily after being fine for a while. Two months isn't that long of a time for our bodies.

Did you alter your diet? Splurge on something?

Have you tried baking soda, vinegar, lemon juice, etc other home cleaners? Maybe your hair needed more than a hot water rinse, maybe it was actually dirty - or maybe your scalp was. Maybe you didn't brush for a day. Maybe the temperature changed with the season.

I keep a sulfate and silicone-free shampoo around in case my hair gets really bad, like if I decide to use Brylcreem and then need to remove it or I go swimming or to a construction site.Sometimes a day in the inner city or on the farm makes my hair dirty enough. If I need to clean, then a light application is all I use. 




   The trick here is how (should he be elected) can Sanders (or anyone else) remove the bureaucracy and money interest to make the government work for all and not for a few.

I can't see this happening in any way other than an increase in subsidiarity and truly or effectively closing federal departments. I have not seen that Bernie is for this, but there is time for me to find out.

Rand is certainly for this. I wonder if Carly Fiorina is as well. 




 Are there any tutorials you recommend? 




 I just finished watching the American Dad episode where Patrick Stewart hosts an episode made to look like a broadway tragic play.

If someone were to make (or has made) a play to this, I would enjoy it. 




 Why did you not x-post this in /r/trees? 




 What IPs are available? Harry Potter? Indiana Jones? Star Wars?

LEGO has strong internal IPs, but I'd like to know. 




 That said, this game will likely be a different beast. Will I can see mods being allowed, but will the code be as accessible? 









 Are you assuming that listening to all people you have the same amount of skepticism at all times, or do you agree that once you know someone is a Scientologist you have to listen more carefully for subtle or sophistic fallacies? 




 Yeah, it would matter that he was a Scientologist only because it would augment all that work identifying the wrong parts of his arguments. Hooray, we agree! 




 So I guess you didn't watch the video.

The plow has ruined entire civilizations. That doesn't mean nations or cities... it means economies. The Bronze age ended in famine and war because the plow created a technology bubble. But instead of money, it was a bubble of human population. The soil eroded away into the valleys and seas and then people died.

Go 31 min into that video and you'll see how not all agriculture decimates soil. Note that the graph only shows erosion, not soil growth. 




 It only means you need to listen more carefully. Not everyone makes the clean arguments that are free from ideology and centered in bare reason and evidence. I still follow CCHRINT on FB for news 




 Or never return but have a lawyer deal with it for you, promptly. 




 I'm here from /r/Soil 
just want to opine that I do not think feedback loops are in play or any of that jazz, but I do think that humans have actively desertified massive areas of the planet and that has caused downwind and downstream areas to be devastated. Yangtze River, (not so) fertile crescent, American dustbowl. (American Colonial agriculture, Indus River die-off, Greek famine, Tiber river valley, Susquehanna river watershed/ Chesapeake Bay...)

The plow has killed more people than the sword.

  This is another case of creating more problems than actually resolving. By further limiting the already limited parking situation downtown and within the Inner Harbor, you place more vehicles on the road at any given moment whom are all actively fighting for already limited parking spaces.

I agree with you, here. Without ample street life, the city still requires weeknight and weekend injections of commerce and places for parents to park in the day to take children to attractions. Removing parking garages can be done after all the other problems are met and mass transit projects have been completed. Parking *lots*, however, are a blight. The ones in Mount Vernon seem to be hanging around because of management, profit margin, or fear of failure issues.

  Previously, there have been incidents in China, such as the Peng Yu incident in 2006, wherein **Good Samaritans who helped** people injured in accidents **were accused of having injured the victim themselves** and in many cases **were forced to pay for the victim's medical bills.** Some commentators have explained that this may have caused people to fear getting in trouble for doing the right thing in Wang's case, thus failing to help.

 What consummate gentlemen. 




 A definition of guttural: harsh-sounding

A tap is *arguably* less harsh than a clap. 




 People didn't always clap in the modern era. There has always been a rash of general banging around. For instance, wherever you find a gathering of gentlemen with canes you can be sure at least some will tap it on the floor or a desk in applause rather than the relatively guttural reaction of hand clapping.

 There is a lot of stuff in this article coming from every angle. Yes, no, maybe! It was a fun read. 














   a decision is known

Maybe I should have stated it differently, but I specifically said I was not referring to a supernatural. I meant to say physically predetermined through that particular phrase.

I think your argument is suffering a gap in reason but I can't put a finger on it right now. 




 For dry goods? It has no spout, so that makes more sense. 




 Have you ever read about [Molinism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molinism)?

Just because the decision is known does not predetermine free will. It merely highlights the limits of humanity.

I do not mean to bring this up as a religious point. I am thinking of it in the context of a non-supernatural world where we merely cannot access the knowledge yet, if ever. 




 I think it is very important to learn that carbohydrates either are already sugars or the human body converts them to sugars and that sugars are addictive. Sugars, particularly fructose, have various proven effects on the human brain and some deleterious ones which require more studies. What is known is that sugars trigger more "happiness" signaling chemicals. Eating them consistently makes the receptors matching these chemicals partially close, making the effect of all triggers lessen.

A calorie-restrictive diet based on carbohydrates will leave people hungry and lacking "happiness" chemical reception. Willpower is not possessed and/or planning is not accessible to everybody in the amount required to follow their chosen diet. I think being hungry *and* depressed at the same time is what causes people to fail to follow their own goals.

EDIT: Re-wrote second sentence, second paragraph. Original: "The willpower or planning that it takes to follow this kind of diet is not possessed and is not accessible to everybody." 




 Having influences on our mental state and knowledge does not preclude us from making decisions, it just affects what decisions and options we perceive. In that, there is always an option to try and learn more.

 I had a staph infection on my wrist in college and when I went to the hospital they numbed it and let is sit for a few minutes. Two guys come in and get ready to cut it open and drain it. "You might feel a little tugging."

They sterilize and get the scalpel... and boy, I feel that tugging. These guys are cutting my skin and I can't feel any pain but I can feel *everything else.* POP!

A little pus explodes on to the mat they have down. The guy cutting says "Oh, that was cool. A big one." His assistant just nods and mutters, "yup."

They milk more out of it and then clean it and stuff paper in it. A bandage goes on and I'm outta there.

It is really weird to experience things that would normally have one sensation. Like, if your finger wasn't frozen you probably would not have heard the sound. 




 The ACA has two main ideas.

* require every person to get insurance

* thousands of pages trying to make it easier for people to get insurance through personal means, employers, or state assistance.

Notice how it does not say that the state must provide health care; it says the individual must acquire health care.

IMO, health care is a debacle because of two things. Pharmacuetical, medical insurance, and hospital companies are protected from competition by lobbying the government and professional licensing associations. The companies are using the state to make mioney off us, which is not capitalism. The other problem is our perverse attachment to employer-provided healthcare. This started being a thing in WWII, but the job market has changed drastically and it makes no sense for offices and restaraunts to offer this when people might change jobs yearly. Every three years is common. 




 Yeah, I can't imagine any other part of the human body so resilient, versitile, and active. Teeth floating through it? No problem. You need a screw in that socket? I'll take it. Let's make something almost as hard as diamond? No problem, how about a few dozen!

 I have a coconut allergy. Why does it take so long for the rash to go away? Is the process the body goes through for eliminating proteins recognized as allergic inefficient? Is it hard for the body to designate a protein for elimination? Do our bodies make the molecules inert and then remove them?

If anyone has literature or links, I would appreciate them.

I know all about allergies up to the point where antibodies are supposedly attaching and capillaries have dilated to send in the white blood cells... but I can't find anything that tells me what happens next.
