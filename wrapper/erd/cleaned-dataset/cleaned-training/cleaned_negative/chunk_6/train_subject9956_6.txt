 Why would advanced aliens build crystal cities on the Moon? It would be far more convenient just to go here and when in the need of the materials which are rare on Earth but plentiful on the Moon just to pop off there for a minute.

 Considering that we eventually will have to move off this planet, I don't think extraterrestrial bases and manned mission are a waste of money.

 Ah, I didn't know that and wondered why my probe couldn't land. I think I am glad for that - before I was using caseless ones because price and weight, because installing the other ones brought no advantage save that they were prettier.

 Thanks, I was thinking that it would be somewhere near those mountains. I was landing there a several times when returning, but didn't notice anything (I acribe it to the fact that it is in the mountains, thus harder to spot). 




 Either I was looking on the wrong desert, or it is too small to see from a landing spacecraft. I know about this easter egg, but I haven't discovered it myself yet (nor almost any other). 




 Well, yes, basically practically technically yes.

 I hated playing it because of only one reason - it frikkin scared me. I don't like horror games - I can play some, though, like more action ones like L4D or KF -, call me a chicken but I can't do it. 

On my first playthrough I got scared shitless almost to the end of Ravenholm and I stopped playing there until two years later (recently), when I thought fuck it and finished the game with cheats - it made it much easier for me. Subsequently I made it through E1 and I have yet to complete E2.

I think best thing about HL games is the world itself, the lore, the story and the atmosphere - it is mysterious, alien, attractive, and desolate. I am no big HL fan, but there is much to be read about it on the internet.

 It is 1600 mHz and DDR3, it may not be listed on the website, but I see no reason it shouldn't work well together (given that other Vengeances of the same specification are there). I have to admit I didn't even check the specific model on my mobo's page because I didn't know I could, I just went with the general compatibility rules. 




 Just defended a Swagian castle with my men and the castle staff against 800something men (they retreated after I mauled 160 of them). So many soft peasant bodies down the cliff... 









 The building guides usually say what should be compatible with what. 




 I had read that it was supposed to creak, but I still thought my money went to the drain. :D 









 I had always had obsolete PCs, mostly second-hand - I had spent a good amount of time gazing at screenshots in game magazines, drooling and dreaming. I had never thought I would ever play those shiny shiny games. I know very well the ails of lowest setting gaming and slow 90s PCs. The breaking point came a year ago when I knew I would have a part-time job and I was wiser and knew that my dream could come true, especially thanks to Reddit.

Prior to the building I thoroughly went through every BaPC guide and BaPC-recommended guide to learn how to build a PC, I even went through rookie-mistake-horrors threads. When I finally picked the parts after some googling and consideration, I asked here if it is good and subsequently changed over half of the parts according to advice. I am not a good picker, I guess.

The building itself went good, though I was nervous as hell and it took me all day. Like "Gosh, my fingers sweat so much, argh, my hard-earned two-month pay have just gone out of window it will all burn out on the first go" everytime I touched anywhere. I don't think I should worry so much about touching the components, should I? The feeling when it turned on was worth it, though.

The sad thing is, I remember how to connect and take out parts and whatnot (during building I was surprised that I almost didn't need a guide how to connect the parts together, it is very obvious - literally, as BaPCers say, like a Lego), but by now I have wholly forgotten what to look for when picking parts (unlike some people here who just go to the store and casually pick up good compatible parts), but I suppose I can consult the internet when the need arises.

Did the mods there become SRS or what that they get offended so easily? Or do they heal their complexes by taking it out on users? 




 Ah, that would be the problem, I don't think it works on mobile. 




 It is a game. Choose nickname and play. Addictive, but aggravating :D 




 Especially the non-pressers. They had one chance to press the button and they will have missed it. 




 What an accurate description! 









 I disagree a bit. It is now commonly thought that spirituality has to do with supernatural, but Saganian definition of spirituality applies to us all. I wish the word "spiritual" wasn't associated with the supernatural, superstitious or gullible.

 Spirit comes from the Latin word to breathe. What we breathe is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word spiritual that we are talking of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything outside the realm of science. On occasion, I will feel free to use the word. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or of acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.
 




 I think that scientific understanding of the world can bring some consolation. You learn that all dies and ends, but however sad that is, it is okay and it is natural to be sad about that. Our little while living in this vast and wonderful cosmos is so much more precious. 




 You don't wanna cuddle, I WILL MAKE YOU CUDDLE!

 That would be sweet if doable. Rovers bounce horribly and are very unpractical atm. I think there should be at least an option to let rovers stick to terrain, because driving several tens of kilometers is just tedious with all the explosions and whatnot. It does not even have to be teleporting, I would love to be able to ride on planets discovering interesting locations, but as I say, riding rovers now is just terribly done. 




 A bug. Unfortunate. I encountered this with Jool in 1.0, under 1000 km there was a ghost force giving me velocity. 




 Don't timewarp so much. Often there will be some miscalculation or whatever with SOIs and it may throw you out of the system.

I think you could alter your orbit a little bit and see if you still get caught by Tylo, if not, then wait for a good opportunity to burn to get an intersect with Bop/Pol.

 Yes, I mean, if you read the Bible as a fantasy that it is, you can draw good lessons from that and discard the bad ones (like you can do with any other book). When you believe it is a innerant guide to life and morality, that is where the problem arises.
