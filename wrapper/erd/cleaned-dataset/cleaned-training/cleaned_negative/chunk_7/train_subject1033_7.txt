  To call it a terrorist flag is a bit of a stretch.

Not really. The KKK has always been quite fond of it, and remains so along with most other "White Power" groups.


 




 As well they should. It's the flag of traitors and domestic terrorists. 









 I's say what is "entirely stupid" is running around waving Confederate/KKK flags as if it's something of which to be proud, rather than ashamed. 




 It will be fun watching these various Republican candidates (who so frequently and proudly dub themselves as members of "the Party of Lincoln") navigate this one. 









 They were sent to die to protect the interests of the permanent leisure class of their day: the Plantation Owners.

Most of them were poor sharecroppers living on the Plantation Owners' land, and didn't have a choice. They were conscripted to preserve the economic interests of their Masters, who owned these poor whites nearly as completely as they did their African-descended slaves.

The "Southern Pride" meme that has taken root has helped these poor white sharecroppers and their descendants psychologically deal with their exploitation by their own white Masters who used them as cannon fodder to protect their cotton profits.

These poor whites have been angry at precisely the wrong people for over 150 years. 




 That the United States still has a huge Confederate problem. 




 Why do so many Americans cling to the flag of sedition, treason, and human bondage? 









 Being a member of America's Permanent Leisure Class has its perks. 




 Good. It's the flag of traitors to the United States. 




 from Rand's offer letter:

"My Dad taught me how to grift from poor, ignorant people. Will you teach me how to grift from rich, ignorant people?" 




 I'm sure the County Sheriff would have been right on that. 




 Bluntly, anti-intellectualism is in many American political circles *celebrated as a virtue.* 

Rank ignorance used to be seen as something to be ashamed of; now it's often promoted as a badge of honor. 

It's quite clear who this anti-intellectual trend is designed to benefit, financially and politically. 




  de-humanizing people by denying they have any validity as human beings at all

Well, that's what the traitor's flag of the Confederacy stands for, after all.

 




 "Southern Pride" in what? 




 There's a reason it's called the war of Northern Aggression in the south.

It's because the Confederacy got their asses kicked, and still can't get over it. 




 They're more likely to shoot themselves. Another problem solved! 




 Oh, "the North invaded"?

Tell us more, traitor. 




 A bunch of toothless, illiterate assholes will wave their guns around? 




 Shut up, traitor. 




  that flag is affixed to the pole and cannot be lowered.

Then how did it get up there? It can be taken down. Hopefully SC will recognize right and take that traitor's flag down before it's taken down with a flamethrower. 




  I like the Confederate flag as a symbol of the state's past.

How about as a symbol of sedition and treason against the United States, resulting in the death of 740,000 Americans? 

 




 Maybe the federal government should tell South Carolina to "fuck off" when they're sucking on that sweet, sweet federal money tit.

That might get South Carolina's priorities in order. 




  damn it, it's a cool looking flag. 

To whom?

 




 Well, Charleston is "the Cradle of the Confederacy." 




 Because the Confederate assholes just moved it to a new pole. 




 It's not *just* a racist flag. It also represents treason against the United States, cowardice, and poor illiterate sharecroppers being forced to lick the boots of the Plantation Owners. 




 I don't think you understood what I meant by "secret assholes." 




 The killer had a "Confederate States of America" front license plate on his Hyundai. 




 Then why require a supermajority to override the seditious display?

It's because the lousy sons-of-traitors know that their treasonous flag would be gone if put to a fair vote. 




 Confederate-Baggers gotta Bag, I guess. 




 Can it be reached with a flamethrower? 




 It seems there are always lots of "secret assholes" running around among the American Right.

Ted Haggard, Larry Craig, and Dennis Hastert are three that come to mind. 




 Or gets their history from Neo-Confederate revisionists like Ron Paul   Co.

Behold: here's [Ron Paul's *The South Was Right!* speech.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEC68vTQwP8) 




 It wasn't flown there before 1962, so there goes the "heritage" canard.

 




 The American South should have been de-Confederatized, just as the Germans had to be de-Nazified after their similar fool's errand.

Seriously. Rename the streets, take down the Confederate statues. There's no "honor" or "pride" in being traitors to the United States, especially considering that the Confederates started the bloodiest war in American history to protect slavery and the Plantation Owners' Leisure Class. 




 Good. It's the flag of cowards, traitors, slavers, and dirt-poor sharecroppers sent to die for the Plantation Owners' "Lost Cause."

How strange and ironic that so many of the descendants of those very same poor sharecroppers who were sent to die (purely to preserve the Plantation Owners' fortunes) still today wave the Stars-and-Bars as sign of "Honor" and "Pride" rather than of their great-great grandfathers' forced military servitude to the Masters of the Old South. 




 Absolutely, because it is. 




 Why give those swine more money? 




 the murdered minister was a state senator. is that not political enough for you all, or did some reactionary complain? 




 He read it in the *Ron Paul Newsletters.* 




  If anyone is willing to find a way to make these cuts, it's going to be Rand Paul.

Good God, the "LIBERTY!" cranks are still every bit as deluded now as they were with Saint Ron.

 




 Can you name a single leftist idea that has worked as promised in reality?

Vaccinations. Or is catching polio and being confined to an iron lung now defined as "LIBERTY!!1!" ? 




 *This is what Foxtards actually believe* 




 Absolut Paultard. Should we buy gold, too? 




 I wonder if Jesse Ventura will beat Johnson for the Libertarian nod?

Or will the Libertarians go to their "deep bench" of candidates, like 2008 candidate Bob Barr? Or 1988 candidate Ron Paul? 




  Do you seriously believe all of us libertarians are conspiring against the world to raise inequality and enriching 1%? That this is our primary goal? We simply want to screw over the poor?

I believe that middle/lower-caste Libertarians are so goddamned starry-eyed over their greed-driven, bankrupt ideology that they they can't see how they'll be crushed under the wheels of the 0.001% leisure class they live to fellate.

And so we come to the central delusion of Libertarianism: most all Libertarians are so fucking gullible they believe they'll *be* among that 0.001% that calls the shots.

As satisfying as it would be to see all of these "Liberty-Lovers" working on chain gangs at the whim of their newly-installed Masters of Capital, prudence and a love of this nation prevents me from wishing they get a chance to find out how truly, deeply, and disastrously wrong they are.

Beware, Libertarians: *the "poor" you screw will be yourselves.*
 




  And why would anyone want to eliminate all such institutions, leaving only entities that pursue only profit-driven motives?

That's what Libertarians call "LIBERTY!!1!"^TM

 




 A slingshot? 




 I hope you enjoy your life as a serf constantly licking the Kochs' boots! 




 "Well, no *true* flat tax..." 




 You can always tell a Libertarian, Republitarian, or Republican by the way they misuse "bias." 




  I'm not giving credit to Rand here; from what I've read he surrounds himself with some impressive economists and technocrats.

Like "Austrian Economics" loon Lew Rockwell?

 




 This is a well thought out plan to redistribute wealth from the working class to the capitalists. It's what all libertarians want in the end.

And these gullible middle/lower-caste Libertarians never seem to realize that they'll be the first ones thrown under the bus, even after they've worked so hard to give over our the nation to their honored and revered Feudal Lords of Capital. 




 There's a holiday novella by Charles Dickens that you really should read. I think you'd identify quite closely with the protagonist. 




  Why should anyone feel entitled to success? The old saying the world needs ditch diggers rings true.

The hilarious thing is how many Libertarians who think they'll rule the roost "in a *truly* Free Market" will wind up scrubbing toilets to earn enough bread to survive for one more day of toilet-scrubbing.

Libertarians/Republitarians: if we ever get to your fantasized "RandWorld," be sure to wash you hands VERY well before scarfing down the Daily Bread ration your Masters have so graciously afforded you! 




  As an example who would come out of college in a better position, someone whos parents paid full ride and got wasted 5 nights a week, or someone who worked 40 hours or more and paid for their own school and board while building a resume and work ethic? Id vote for the latter.

Are you including inheritance from Daddy?
 




 People patting themselves on the back because they're so smart and talented.

It's a very frequent delusion among Libertarians/Republitarians. 




  Just maybe they're smarter than you, more talented than you or they just flat out worked harder than you.

Or maybe "they" screwed their workers by systematically exploiting their labor to reap egregious personal profit, all while dodging societal responsibilities.
 




 And many of them assume they'll be counted among the "haves" after their glorious revolution, or at least their obedient lapdogs, rather than the miserable masses.

That's what's makes it so funny: so many Libertarian clones with the social skills of Adam Lanza fantasizing that they will be hailed as the natural and rightful leaders and commanders of "GaltWorld."

These maladjusted, self-fantasized "Captains of Industry" would be lucky to get jobs shoveling shit for their new "LIBERTY!!!1"^TM Masters. 




 in the Quicksand 




 Maybe the right-wing apologists are going with the Santorum strategy and pretending he said "I'm here to kill all the blah people." 




 The funny thing about the "Obama didn't call Benghazi a terrorist attack!!1!" Fox-AM meme-lie is that the President ***DID*** identify it as an "act of terror" at a press conference in the Rose Garden *the very morning following the attack.*

That's how Romney got his ass handed to him in the debate: he asserted his Fox News meme-lie on a non-Fox controlled medium. Romney got called out on it, and just stood there like a fool with his ass waving in the breeze.

To this day you'll ***still*** find right-wing mouth-breathers who regurgitate the *"But... but... he never called them terrorists!!!1one!"* lie. 




 [Help help, I'm bein' repressed!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/49c35091e4d9d2716c7d32d7f0328f7a/tumblr_mj88inc4aw1rnzcl1o1_500.gif) 




 Like an "Oops!" kind of "accident," Rick? 




 Why do Confederates always resort to such violent imagery? 




 The flag of cowards, traitors, and slavers "works here"?

I don't think so. 




 Man I really wish we could give them a second shot at the whole seceding from the union thing.

Even if so, they'd be on their knees in Washington DC begging for re-admission within a decade. It might give them the much-needed dose of humility that they failed to learn the first time around.
 




 It's the flag of cowards, traitors, slavers, and sharecroppers sent to die for the Plantation Owners' "Lost Cause."

How strange and ironic that so many of the descendants of those very same poor sharecroppers who were sent to die to preserve the Plantation Owners' fortunes today wave the Stars-and-Bars as sign of "Honor" and "Pride" rather than of their great-great grandfathers' forced military servitude to the Masters of the Old South.
 




 And he's absolutely right.

Let's start calling the perpetrators of such violence what they really are: domestic terrorists. 









 The NRA and its affiliates are now not so much "gun rights" organizations as they are "domestic terrorist" organizations.

Any American with a sense of honor or decency resigned from the NRA a long time ago. If you're still allowing yourself to be a victim of LaPierre and his fellow scamsters, though, it's never too late to repent and resign. Do it today. 




 And the American Right just keeps on trying to make excuses for another of the products of their own propaganda... 




 Rick Perry doesn't just drink the Tea  he gargles it first. 




  There's a good chance that this person is both a racist and a Republican.

I say (in sorrow) that the line dividing the two grows more faint daily. 




 Because the Republican base is full of Dylan Roof's kind, and the Republicans are sure as hell not going to call out their own supporters. 




 Keep on apologizing for right-wing domestic terrorists. You'll go far in life, no doubt. 




 How about Ted Nugent (also an NRA Board Member) who has repeatedly threatened the life of the President and repeatedly called him a "subhuman mongrel"?

You lie down with dogs, you get fleas.

I (along with most other Americans) am sick of right-wing dimwits, domestic terrorists, and their apologists being cut a free pass because of the widespread "they's a-comin' to git mah gunnzzzzz!!1!" delusion. 




 Given all the race-baiting horseshit that Fox and AM radio broadcast daily, quite probably. 




  Who brainwashed this kid and turned him into this monster?

Traitorous Neo-Confederates who still can't get over their ass-whooping, even 150 years later.

 




 The Minister killed was a SC State Senator, for one.

Also, read what the killer shouted while he was perpetrating the crimes. But somehow I think you won't, or will find some way to explain it away if you do. 




  Please give me an example of when a sane person committed a mass murder.

Timothy McVeigh.

 




 Don't forget his "Confederate States of America" front license plate. 




 the extreme left who at every chance rambles incoherently about banning guns

Oh, please. There is no left in America, let alone an "extreme left," and no one want to "ban yer gunzz."

This sham idea is a product of NRA mass mailings designed to separate the gullible and paranoid from their money. It's a shame it continues to work so well for LaPierre and Co.

 




 If there are any honorable members of the NRA left, this is your cue to resign from that fetid organization.
 




  Usually you'll save more lives by engaging the shooter anyway.

Oh look! It's the "I'MMA HERO PATRIOT!!1!" delusional murder-masturbation-fantasy again.

 




 The White Wing of the Right Wing in America is growing ever more dangerous and violent.

Their domestic terrorism must end. 




 Does Jeb Bush feel the same way about Evangelical Protestants? 




 The Gunbertarian Downvote Militia has arrived. Surprised it took them this long. 




 Why would you want to return to the Age of Confederate Traitors? 




 We can't ignore the of White Wing of the Right Wing anymore.

Domestic terrorists.

 




 Why did Ben Carson retire as a brain surgeon? 




 We can't afford to ignore the White Wing of the Right Wing any longer. 




 If you're an NRA member, the only honorable thing to do is resign.

Do it today. 









 If you're an NRA member, the only honorable thing to do is resign.

Do it today. 




 Because he is a terrorist. 

Right-wing domestic terrorism can't be explained away anymore. We continue to do so at our great peril. 




 See above. 




 *A reading from the Newsletters of St. Ron Paul*

Blast 'em?

"If you live in a major city, youve probably already heard about the newest threat to your life and limb, and your family: carjacking.

"It is the hip-hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos. The youth simply walk up to a car they like, pull a gun, tell the family to get out, steal their jewelry and wallets, and take the car to wreck. Such actions have ballooned in the recent months.

"In the old days, average people could avoid such youth by staying out of bad neighborhoods. Empowered by media, police, and political complicity, however, the youth now roam everywhere looking for cars to steal and people to rob.

"What can you do? More and more Americans are carrying a gun in the car. An ex-cop I know advises that if you have to use a gun on a youth, you should leave the scene immediately, disposing of the wiped off gun as soon as possible. Such a gun cannot, of course, be registered to you, but one bought privately (through the classifieds, for example).

"I frankly dont know what to make of such advice, but even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, Ive urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. **For the animals are coming.**"

 Right-wing domestic extremists are the terrorists we need to worry about, especially since so many of them call themselves "Patriots." 




 2-day-old account, -65 karma. 




 Your citations are from all of Europe *over a period of ten years.*

That decade-long list looks about the same as any given two-month period in the United States. 




 Is he kidding?

Paranoia about "gunz and 'bortions" is just about the only reason people vote Republican/Libertarian these days.

This won't play well with his dad Ron's White Nationalist/Neo-Confederate base. 




 So "wnd.com" is allowed in this subreddit, but "salon.com" suffers under  *de facto* censorship?

Must be all that "liberal bias" we keep hearing about. 




 The White Wing of the Right Wing is increasingly dangerous to our nation. 




 Fucking delusional, they are.

I fear that these "Patriot"/tacticool/Militia assholes will soon act out again in a big way, such as Timothy McVeigh did in Oklahoma City. 




 Maybe Sean Hannity could be waterboarded with Kool-Aid (for the troops, of course.)

How many days has it been now? 




 That may not be accurate. For all we know he could have riffed off Rick Santorum and announced "I'm here to shoot blah people." 




 TIL Count Dooku was on drugs. 




 "and minimum wage."

You have this fantasy that eliminating payroll taxes would suddenly motivate the busboy's boss to give said busboy a 15% raise out of the goodness of his heart.

That's a self-evidently nave scenario, but sadly typical of most Libertarians and the economic Fantasyland which they inhabit. 




 Nope, sorry. His boss will keep that for himself. 

It always intrigues me how Libertarians detest the government, yet blindly and navely trust the Ownership Class that treats them ten times worse.

I guess Libertarians don't mind licking boots as long as they are worn by those they worship as "Job Creators."

This is one of many reasons why no one can or should take Libertarians seriously. 




 White Nationalists have long fantasized about a "coming Race War."

There's a RWNJ decades-old race-war novel out there ("The Turner Diaries") that many extremists of the American Right view as a blueprint  (Timothy McVeigh among them.)

Ron Paul's racist 1990s newsletters addressed the  "Race War" topic often.

I fear right-wing domestic terrorists and their sympathizers are growing restless again. Given their self-gratifying "Hero Patriot" fantasies in which they "restore America," we should all be aware of the dangers they may pose. We've seen it boil over before, as in Oklahoma City.

 




 Redrum Springa 




 Surprised it wasn't Doc Martens with red laces. 




 Clearly it's violent video games 




 Eleanor Roosevelt comes to mind. 




 The Kochs have more money than they could ever spend in 10,000 lifetimes of the greatest opulence.

It's control of the entire system they're after, and the power which accompanies it.  




  what would have been implemented under a McCain administration.

Or a Palin Administration.

 




  these people don't care about it because they can afford to: hire their own police/fire dept, pay medical bills, and protect their assets.

See also the rise of gated communities.

 




 Because "LIBERTY!"^TM dies when they can't fly their private jets, anywhere, anytime, and for any reason (up to and including into things/one another.)

 There's a subreddit for people like you.

  doesn't this brand of libertarianism inevitably lead to some form of feudalism? 

Absolutely, yes. However, most libertarians delude themselves that they will be among the Lords of this new a Monarchy of Capital.

May they never get their wish, and learn how truly, truly wrong they are.
 




 Please tell us all how, as a busboy who "live[s] off tips and make[s] minimum wage," the Kochs' agenda will benefit you.

It would make a great AMA. 




 As it is for most Libertarians, the Age of the Robber Barons is the Kochs' fantasy era. 




 Their father was a founding member of the John Birch Society. 




 TL;DR: even 150 years later, Ron Paul still can't get over it.

FTFY.

Libertarians are largely paranoid goldbugs who think Reaganomics was weak sauce.

It is ***astounding*** that the story of this [Koch coin](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/david-kochs-got-dime-you) hasn't received more attention.
