 Added. I thought I had it added when I initially posted the story. Totally forgot. Thank you for the heads up.

 The article is from APS which is "The American Physiological Society is a nonprofit devoted to fostering education, scientific research, and dissemination of information in the physiological sciences. The Society was founded in 1887 with 28 members. APS now has over 10,500 members. Most members have doctoral degrees in physiology and/or medicine"

The lead researcher, Irina Petrache, has done numerous research on the dangers of smoking. Her main area of research is actually focused on the damage caused by smoking cigarettes on the lungs. http://medicine.iupui.edu/faculty-profile/ipetrach/Petrache-Irina 

The article also happens to be peer-reviewed here: http://ajplung.physiology.org/content/ajplung/early/2015/05/11/ajplung.00411.2014.full.pdf

The lead researcher also has articles in other journals like Nature on the dangers of smoking cigarettes.

I guess my comment here is an exercise in futility. Aside from some, it seems everyone else made up his mind here that big tobacco paid a user to get a post on a subreddit as if every earthling reads r/science (which btw would have been awesome, its a very insightful corner of reddit)
