 "Ruining cinema" is never valid. 




 Apart from Jurassic World (and maybe Pacific Rim), you'll appreciate all of the films you just listed a lot more by paying attention as they're all quite rewarding, well thought out and one or are open to complex analysis (The Raid 2, Mad Max). 




 You're overanalysing. No, I'm not, I'm just explaining to you why I don't like this movie. 




 
* High Noon
* The Good, The Bad and the Ugly
* The Outlaw Josey Wales
* Unforgiven
* True Grit (remake)
* Django Unchained

I like revisionist Westerns. What can I say? I also like posts in chronological order. 




 East of West 




 For me CinemaSins is different because they shit all over movies they really like and I find that better IMO. 




 Which guide are you using? 




 The real losers were the readers. 




 Spider-Woman, She-Hulk, White Tiger, Moondragon, Quasar, Mantis, Hawkeye and The Runaways are my picks. 




 Die Hard. 




 Cheesy is really stylised dialogue. Bad dialogue is a pretty major compliant as it can ruin immersion and characterisation and sometimes it's not enjoyable to watch. If you're watching an 80s action movie and complaining about one-liners being bad dialogue, then that's not a legitimate complaint as it's a stylistic choice. 




 It's annoying because films are an audio/visual medium. Style is substance. 




 It's as valid as saying Spielberg or Marvel are ruining cinema. 




 Storywise, I think there are more interesting interpretations, but in storytelling method (visuals in the instance) there is none better. 




 They're funny when you agree with them. If you don't it feels like their either shitting all over a film or unjustly praising it.  




 Dimestore philosophy.

A) this is normally applied to blockbusters so give thwm the benefit of the doubt
B) the philosophy shouldn't be judged on its complexity, rather how well in keeping with the themes of the film it was
C) there are always going to be people who find it interesting if you don't. Maybe it'll inspire them to look into some of the deeper stuff. 




 His son is Spider-Man + edge. 




 Why? 




 The aim of the deck is to gift the enemy as much health as possible and use Hope for Escape to draw as many cards as possible in the hopes of drawing Exodia. I'd appreciate

 I think Bendis is just speaking from the experiences of his multiracial children, but isn't aware it doesn't matter too much to everybody. To me, it makes a big difference - I always notice when a film is all white people and it takes me out of it. 




 The Dark Knight Returns 




 It builds to the action really well. Like it takes forever to get to, but when you get there, it feels more than worth it. 




 95% artistic control. If a writer/artist wants to do something really stupid their editors will try and stop them and also the editors advise quite a bit. 




 Probably because a large chunk of DC heroes are actual Gods. 




 Resurrection. :'( 




 Oh absolutely. Video games are much more *capable* then movies, yet aside from blockbuster games, most games lack a decent storyteller on board and don't utilise the medium full potential. 

Honestly, movies are the third most capable medium after video games and comic books. 









 With early Spielberg films, they're completely dependent on whether or not you accept that sense of awe. If you don't feel that, you're not going to enjoy the movie. Yhat's how I feel about Jaws and Jurassic Park. 




 Thank God, there are two of us. I thought I was alone in this sea of downvotes, but now I've found a companion. Gee, how shitty are the Lord of the Rings films? 




 I don't like Lord of the Rings. I actually think they're abysmal.  




 Yet most video games fail to use the medium to its strengths to tell stories. 




 Batgirl: Year One? Batman is only in about 20% of it, but their shared screentime is a highlight. I've enjoyed all of Batgirl's fleeting appearances in Tomasi and Gleason's Batman and Robin. Volume 4 and 6 mainly. 




 It implies Wolverine tried to have sex with her, but he didn't because MJ said no. The guy is an absolute scumbag and probably a rapist (seeing as he was created by Mark Millar), but he didn't rape MJ. 




 No Black Widow? 




 [Here's some good Batman](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/39sz97/i_just_spent_the_past_few_months_reading_a_lot_of/cs6fbwk) 




 I'm not to fond of her wearing the Jewel outfit. Almost all fansites have pictures of Her in that outfit and I think it's a complete misrepresentation of her character. 




 I don't recall Daryl saying anything racist. I thought people just assumed because his brother did. 




 Season Seven was decent. 




 Isn't there an animated film? 




 Maybe he thought it was less controversial then telling the truth - he isn't a fan of Chris Pratt. 




 Made by someone who understood the novel. 




 That completely makes sense. Characters change over time. None of the Friends were as two-dimensional as they were in Season 1 in Season 6. But, take the Simpsons, the characters slowly improved over the first decade or so, but then they devolved into stupid charictures of themselves and worst of all, it wasn't as entertaining. 

That's how I feel about Community, except by Season 6 and it has retained the same writers. Yes, these characters are expected to grow and change, but I think the way they've grown is pure shit. 




 And I don't like Lord of the Rings. [There isn't a place for us here.](https://38.media.tumblr.com/548808390d76dd057811cc2d9f3f8942/tumblr_nc6y8lJXWF1tkl30lo8_500.gif) 




 This may be the worst place to discuss this, but I'm watching Season 6 and it's really pissing me off. At the start Britta seemed kind of clever and likable, but slowly devolves into a dumb, pot-smoking, hippie. Then she switches back and forth every other episode. Abed used to be the cute kid with Asperger's, but by Season 3, he is just a vehicle for meta-jokes and an excuse to cannibalise other shows. Pierce started off really funny, but by the end his racism was no longer endearing and just cringe-worth (probably collateral damage from Season 4 though). Chang is just an excuse for a few one-liners here and there. Frankie-as-Yahoo was interesting for one mediocre episode, but it left her very bland later on in the season. More often then not, the show is too Jeff-centric to give the other characters anything meaningful to do in the A-Plot and I'm still not sure where I stand on his daddy-issues, narcissism, Jeff's need for his friends and his leadership skills. All of those things seem contradictory to me.

What's worse is Harmon seems to be aware of all of this and not give a damn. His self-aware brand of humour is consistently pointing out his awareness for these things and he doesn't do a damn thing to change it. It's worse when Harmon is just using characters as mouthpieces for things he doesn't like (Avengers, The Sting, Big Budget movies). It isn't subtle and the characters all suffer for it. I find the fact he only every does this to critise stuff really disheartening as well. Personally, I think it's kind of nihilistic how he never praises films through this. Sure, occasionally you'll get a Die Hard homage or what-have-you, but it feels more like a passing reference and more of a directorial decision.

The AV Club's review of Advanced Safety Features inadvertently highlights why this is such a problem for me.
I certainly wouldnt call Features one of the best episodes of Community, but its the first one of the season to completely reveal the shows core of sadness and sentimentality. Without that core, Community would be an alienating, smarter-than-thou, up-its-own-ass single-camera sitcom, and the world needs another one of those like it needs another Madea movie. 

For me, this sentiment all is sourced from the characters, but I feel the show is lacking it because it's characters suck and as a result it is an alienating, smarter-than-thou, up-its-own-ass single-camera sitcom.

So, anyone up for Madea? Madea? Madea? Madea? 




 I have a few puppets in my garage. Want me to put on a show? 




 Super. 




 Fast and Furious and Mission Impossible. They're both big, tense action movies where the characters do physics defying stunts and banter among themselves. I feel Mission Impossible would also focus on highlighting the tight friendship of the group like The Fast and The Furious demonstrates. You could probably throw in The Avengers as well.  




 Funny you say that as all of the comics he's written have been pretty shitty. 




 What matters is that it was a good real. 




 Comics are an art form. Art - not all, but some - should be able to contribute to discussion and provoke thoughts. 




 Marvel Unlimited. It's cheap, accessible and has such a wide range. 




 Is Pak's run good? I wanna pick it up. 




 The writing still has a little ways to go. I wish they would stop spelling everything out for us. Once they start doing that, it'll be a prestige drama.

My favourite example.
They open the boot of a car to find a walker with her legs and arms bound together. Maggie looks into the boot and begins contemplating what it means in silence. Carol comes over and says "She was trapped..."

That's fine and is still kind of subtle, but Carol's next line kills me.
"Like us."

However there is a lot of ambiguous symbolism in the show nowadays, certain in the episodes directed by Greg Nictero (easily the show's best director).

I think Daredevil will be prestige television come next season as the worst episodes were written by Steven DeKnight - which was a shame as I really like the man - and now he's left the show should improve. DeKnight did the same thing as The Walking Dead writers where he'd explain the hidden meanings behind everything and it bugged me. Also he directed the last episode which had some of the worst action in the series. It turned really superhero-y with a dependence on cinematic music and larger than life fight moves. It wasn't interesting to watch and wasn't helped by all of the jump cuts. Now that he's out of the picture, Daredevil will certainly be prestige drama.

I don't now whether many people like Agents of Shield on this sub, but I feel that having 22 episodes helped the plotting quite a bit. They divided the series into three distinct chunks - Search for the City, Skye Dealing with Power/Real Shield and the Inhumans - this meant there was room for some pretty complex plot webs and character work. People who were previously kinda boring became interesting thanks to having episodes dedicated to expanding on their character (looking at you Ward). The cast is also too big to deal with the 15-odd characters in 13 episodes. Coulson, Fitz-Simmons, Skye, Ward, Mack, Hunter, Mockingbird and May all got pretty decent arcs in Season Two and most of them would've been forgotten about if there was a 13 episode season.

Managing to tell three stories actually makes it similar to three four-issue comic book arcs which I guess is quite faithful to modern comics where everything is quite decompressed and it takes a while for things to pay off. This is kind of the opposite of the Flash which had a Silver-Age meets Claremont plotting; one wacky conflict every week with some soapy elements and foreshadowing future episodes. Agents of Shield tried this in Season One and it didn't really work, but come Season Two's more serialised plotting, it was a vastly improved show (helped that they got some decent directors and fight choreographers too). Also, [the dialogue is superb and constantly funny](http://imgur.com/a/VhB00). The last episode provided my [new favourite line in the MCU.](http://i.imgur.com/H6wz2Qq.gif)

Because of all of this really interesting character work and really complex plotting, I could make the case that would be prestige television with a few revisions. Namely the direction and the action. The directors need to get the actors to do more physically. They spend too much of the episode standing still with their arms crossed. They really need to be more active to present a similar energy to the rest of the MCU. The colouring is far too bland and reminds me too much of a crappy 90s Batman. I'd love to see much more colour on the show. Light blues and greens would really work in my opinion. Lastly, the action needs a lot of work. The slow-mo in the finale was timed dreadfully and had no weight to it. There are a few really great action moments - [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hReYNlIoIWE) and Face My Enemy come to mind, but often it's not really clear what's going on or Clark Gregg feels too much like a middle-aged guy playing pretend. I'd love to actually see Coulson get tired after a fight or get really out of breath. If this can be achieved, I think it'll be in the same league.

 Personally, I'd recommend getting [Marvel Unlimited](https://marvel.com/comics/unlimited/home? options%5Boffset%5D=0 totalcount=12) to read it all digitally as it's cheaper and more easily accessible, but if you don't have a device for it or have an aversion to reading digitally, I've added Amazon links.

 Sent. 




 Would you mind if I gave you some Daredevil recommendations? 




 True and I did love Daredevil. I hope it goes into more of the crazy shit from the comics later. I need Typhoid Mary, Bullseye, Elektra, Stone, White Tiger and the Out storyline all to happen eventually. 




 I'd love for Balder and Bill to show up out of nowhere and everyone act like they've been there the whole time. 




 Free Bird. Right guys? 




 It's important to pay respects to both Greek and Roman interpretations equa- no, this is bullshit. I misspelt it. 




 Iron Lad? As in the guy from the 30th century who discovers he'll become a supervillain and kill his friends if he returns, but the world will be destroyed anyway if he doesn't? That *lame* Iron Lad? 




 Ehh. He's not my tempo. 




 Wait. It's not OK to own black people or castrate gays? Well shit...

Edit: Is it still OK to jail gay people if they've committed a crime? Need to know ASAP. 




 So something like 24: Live Another Day is comparable to another episode of the original series? I think there is a notable enough difference there. 




 Isn't the X-Files a sequel show whereas AD is the same show continued? 




 But the Marvel universe contains men in robot suits on roller skates, a 95 y/o super soldier and mother fucking Heracules. 




 Isn't AD just between seasons? 




 I don't think so. It's still got the highest rating on IMDb and - despite this being a relatively finite number of people - most people I've talked to agree it's the best. 




 The Sandman is pretty much responsible for comics being a medium I can get behind. Vertigo and modern Image can all be traced back to his work. 




 I've read Gotham Central if that helps.  




 The we'd lose Kate Mara who is a very entertaining actress.  




 Did anyone else really enjoy his Deadpool? 




 Surprised this hadn't already been mentioned. For me it's the Ultimate Fallout issue with Peter's funeral. 




 When I hear beautiful movie, I immediately think about movies with great visuals and I love the animated movie 5 Centimetres Per Second. A great series of coming of age stories. 




 They hired Michael B Jordan to play Johnny Storm because that's the actor Josh Trank wanted for the part. They haven't been exploitive in their marketing IMO. Frankly, MBJ is an excellent choice and will really blow people away if they could see past his race. 




 I mean... Shit... We just got Morgan back. 




 Shit. They're introducing Heath from the comics next season. We just fucking got Morgan back. 




 Someone should recheck Arrested Development. 




 Saga. 




 I love this story, but I still don't really et what's sad about it. 




 Don't take away my hope for Vin Diesel ad Black Bolt. 




 Bradley Cooper. 




 Not even The Hoff? 




 I've read it and love it, but nothing there is particularly heart-wrenching. What do you think is? 




 Rucka returning to the Big 2? Star Wars truly is miraculous. 




 Like ten. They have a small department for it. 









 Too old. 




 I'm curious what your friends' problem with Brienne was.  









 When you write a film, do you have a paticular voice actor in mind? 




 Mike Carey's masterpiece turned into a crime procedural... 




 Hannibal - the main character is reinterpreted as such.  




 It's not a great book (The Walking Dead that is), but it's fun, great for beginners and has pretty good female characters. 




 [If you're into Marvel movies, I recently posted a recommendation for someone else about all the upcoming MCU characters.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/39vj3m/comics_to_read_before_upcoming_marvel_movies/cs6wbec) 




 I'd include Sex Criminals and (maybe) The Walking Dead. 




 I agree, that twist was handled so poorly, but I think that most of those flaws would have been overlooked had it been made in the 80s - on reflection - like I do for most of Spielberg's work. 




 Sugar 




 High Noon 




 No, but it averages at 7s-8s out of ten, and I feel if it was made 20 years prior, it'd be considered a classic. 




 Pierce Brosnan as Old Man Cyclops. I just want to hear Brosnan's beautiful singing voice again. 




 That's because his character was identical to his usual big-screen persona. 




 I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but it is a very CGI heavy film. 




 I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but it is a very CGI heavy film. 




 Now try John Bishop's. 




 Do you have a schematic or a world save? I'd love to check it out. 




 It's high on my list of comics to buy and from what I've seen, it looks very good. 




 There's worse, but the question was worst/uninteresting and I just find them very uninteresting as a big fan of both characters. 




 Captain America: The First Avenger and Super 8. I'm not sure how much more of an impact they'd have, but I think they'd be better received. They are the most Spielbergian films I've seen not directed by him or Robert Zemeckis. 

Also, if the Avengers had been released 3 decades ago, we would have had a myriad of shared universes in the 90s and they probably would have been done so poorly that the concept would have died off in the 00s. 




 If you're into comics, you might want to check [this](http://www.imgur.com/gallery/0cC6o) out. 




 I'm not sure whether we can consider a setting a clich. I love Westerns, but I wouldn't call the American Frontier a clich I love. 




 Other than the fact it is dreadful, it misrepresents almost every character involved. Because of its dreadful characterisation, it will give a really poor representation of characters in the MCU. 




 I don't think people become psychopaths. 




 I know it's really immature, but Rider's name cracks me up every time I read it. 




 Exactly, it's so stupidly inaccurate I can't believe that quite a few critics stated it.
