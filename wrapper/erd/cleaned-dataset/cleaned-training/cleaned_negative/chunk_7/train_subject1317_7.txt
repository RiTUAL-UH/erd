 Yes I am. Black Tahoe Limited. 




 Which episode? I'll have to see it. I must be behind. Building a 71 Monte Carlo and we used to drag race one and I've always called it Monster Carlo. 









 Yes. Country Classic Cars off I-55 Staunton, IL exit 









 That's the place! 




 Not racing. I'll be long hauling though. Look for this truck http://imgur.com/kBxvkld 




 Maybe it's an improvement over a stock Dart? 




 A few more shots.
