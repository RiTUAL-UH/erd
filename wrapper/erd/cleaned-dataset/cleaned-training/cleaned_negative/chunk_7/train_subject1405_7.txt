 [Quinoa casserole with kale and chickpeas](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/03/05/foodiesphere-baked-quinoa-casserole-with-kale-chickpeas/)

Ingredients
bushel of kale, diced
two tablespoons olive oil
two cloves garlic, minced
feta crumbles (4 oz.)
1 cup quinoa, cooked
1 can chickpeas 
tablespoon lemon juice
2 Roma tomatoes, diced

Directions
Preheat your oven to 350F. Chop the kale well, meaning into small bits that have less than an inch of stem. In a skillet, heat olive oil (peanut or canola or vegetable oil will do as well, it doesn't matter). When it's hot, add kale and garlic and saute until fragrant and the kale is bright green. When done, place into a large bowl with chickpeas and diced tomatoes and mix.

I cook quinoa with a chicken bouillon cube, but you could just as easily use two cups of stock or just water (again, it doesn't matter). When the quinoa is nearly done, drain away half of the liquid. Pour the rest into the bowl with the kale, chickpeas, and tomatoes. Mix it well, then pour into a casserole dish (mine is 7 x 11) and even it out.

Put into oven and bake for 30 minutes. After about thirty minutes, remove from oven and sprinkle the feta over the top. Place back into the oven for at least 15 more minutes.

Ingredients
1 tbsp olive oil

 Store bought BBQ sauce is loaded with added sugar. I love BBQ sauce, but I hate diabetes. Something has to give. So my wife gave me a barbecue sauce recipe that she had scrawled down from somewhere to use in a recent slow cooker pulled pork dish I made. [Full post here](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/02/26/foodiesphere-three-simple-things-bbq-sauce-frittata-a-casserole/)

Ingredients
2 tbsp peanut oil
medium onion, diced
2 cloves of garlic, diced
tbsp chili powder
2 tbsp worcestershire sauce
2 tbsp mustard
1/3 cup honey
can tomato sauce
tbsp liquid smoke
tsp seasoning salt**
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar

Directions
Saute the finely diced onion and garlic in peanut oil for 5-10 minutes. Add everything else, bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. Stir regularly.

**I made my own seasoning salt:
2 tbsp salt
1/2 tsp paprika
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cornstarch

This bbq sauce turned out nice. To my palate it tasted like a very potent sloppy joe mix. 










































































 I've always felt The Woodlanders deserves more attention 




 this was the recipe I based my version on, I just needed more peppers! 



















 that looks like a good variation! I like the paprika   it certainly ups the tomatoes

 [Creamy Tomato Basil Parmesan Soup](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/02/19/foodiesphere-creamy-tomato-basil-parmesan-soup/)

Ingredients
2 cans diced tomatoes
1/2 cup diced celery
1/2 cup diced carrots
1 cup diced onion
1 tsp dried oregano
4 tbsp dried basil
4 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup olive oil
1 cup ground flaxseed (I used a coffee grinder)
1 tsp each salt and pepper
1.5 cup shredded parmesan
2 cups half and half, warmed

Directions
In a large soup pot, heat oil on medium heat adding celery, onion, and carrots once hot. Saute for 5-10 minutes.

Add tomatoes, chicken broth, basil, and oregano. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer.

While mixture is simmering, melt butter in a separate pot. Once the butter has melted slowly whisk in flaxseed flour. Add some of the liquid from the soup (a cup or so) and whisk until smooth. Then pour mixture into the soup. Stir until the soup thickens. Add Parmesan mixing it in well. Stir in warmed half and half, salt. and pepper.

Let soup simmer on low heat, covered, for 15-20 minutes. Keep an eye on the soup to avoid letting the Parmesan stick to the bottom of the pot. When the carrots are soft, the soup is done.

 [Edamame Fried Rice](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/02/18/foodiesphere-moroccan-crockpot-chicken-with-chickpeas-edamame-fired-rice/)

Ingredients
cooking spray
2 eggs, well beaten
2 tablespoons peanut oil
8 ounces sliced mushrooms
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
4 cups broccoli florets
2 cups kale, chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 cup uncooked short-grain brown rice, cooked according to the package instructions
1 1/2 cups frozen, shelled edamame, defrosted
3 tablespoons soy sauce (or fish sauce)

Directions
First, the eggs. Coat a skillet with cooking spray and set over high heat. Add the well beaten eggs, turning the pan to coat it with a thin layer of eggs. Cook 30 seconds, loosening the inside edges of the eggs with a spatula. What youre looking to do is create a thin scramble. Once done set aside.

Place a large skillet over medium heat (you can use the same skillet as you did for the eggs but make sure its large). Add half the oil. Once hot, add the mushrooms, bell pepper, broccoli, and kale. Cook 5-10 minutes, turning often, until the vegetables soften. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant.

Increase the heat. Push the vegetables to one side of the skillet and add a little more oil and the rice. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, turning the rice over with a metal spatula and scraping up bits that stick to the pan. Add the edamame and soy sauce. Stir well to mix in the soy sauce for 5-10 minutes. Turn off the heat but continue to stir until well mixed, then add eggs.

 good input! thank you 




 Chickpea Coriander Burgers

Ingredients

can chickpeas, drained
a sprinkle of lemon juice (less than a teaspoon)
1 tsp ground cumin
tablespoon of ground coriander
1 egg
cup of breadcrumbs/Panko
1 medium red onion
1 tbsp olive oil/peanut oil

Directions
I have a small a food processor in which I put the chickpeas, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, and the egg. Once the mixture is a good thickness, scrape it into a bowl. In the bowl, add breadcrumbs and the diced onions. The mixture needs to chill for at least 10 minutes. Form however many patties youd like but try to keep them uniform in thickness and width.

I use peanut oil to fry with these days because it has a high smoke point (meaning its damn difficult to burn peanut oil, Im not skilled enough to fry with olive oil and not make a mess). Pour at least a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan and let it get hot (every oven will vary, I dont have an oven with a proper flame so I tend to use Medium-to-Low), which usually takes about two or three minutes. You dont want them to burn but you want them crisp on the outside. Fry them for about four minutes on each side.

Quinoa Sliders

Ingredients

1 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed
2 cups vegetable or chicken stock
can of chickpeas
1/2 cup freshly grated cheese (provolone, mozzarella)
1/4 cup Panko/breadcrumbs
1/2 cup chopped carrots
2 green onions
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 large egg
3 tablespoons olive oil/peanut oil
Directions

Cook the quinoa with the stock. Once cooked, remove from heat and set aside.

Chop green onions and carrots and mince the garlic, then place in a bowl with the shredded cheese and panko and mix the ingredients. I again used my mini-food processor to chop up the chickpeas. Once the chickpeas are thick, add it to the bowl. Add quinoa and and egg, mix well. I always place the mixture in the fridge for a bit (10 minutes).

I usually make my patties from flattening the ball Ive rolled around in my palm, but you can do whateverjust make sure they are uniform.

Heat your skillet with olive or peanut oil. Once hot, put the patties in and fry until crispy (between 3-5 minutes on each side). If youre a dolt like me, you may need to have more oil at hand and occasionally clean out the skillet of burnt debris between patties.

Twice-Baked Butternut Squash

Ingredients

1 butternut squash (medium or large)
2 shallots (small or medium)
cup of quinoa
2 cups of water
cup of gorgonzola
Directions

Preheat oven to 400. Slice butternut squash in half length wise. Scoop out seeds. Place each half cut side down in a 913 pan (or whatever size you have, I used a 99) and pour a cup of water (water is important, make sure its in your pandont put the squash in the oven without it). Place in oven and bake until tender, about 45-60 minutes. Once done, remove and set aside.

Dice the shallots. In a skillet heat oil. Saute shallots until they give off a nice aroma or are translucent (in plainspeak this means 5-10 minutes). In the same skillet add quinoa and cup of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer at let cook until water is absorbed, 12-15 minutes. Essentially, just cook the quinoa and then add the sauted shallots.

With quinoa done, go back to squash and scoop out the inside. Leave some in but youre carving out space for the quinoa. Cut side up return the squash to the pan (chuck the water, you dont need it anymore).

The squash you scooped out you need to mix with the gorgonzola cheese. When the quinoa is done, mix it with the cheese and squash mixture. Take this mixture and fill in each half of the squash in the pan. If youd like sprinkle some gorgonzola over the top.

Return the stuffed squash to oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese has melted and the tops begin to brown. Remove from oven, cut eat half in half, and serve.

 always makes sense to actually read the article before you comment. just saying 





























 Definitely a legit issue   I thought about that, but I figured that a whole-cloth reinvention would be more alienating. So this way it's kind of anchored, at least, that's my thought. 




 I think that's a valid point. But I don't fancy the over-the-top covers usually employed in the genre. I've never believed that a fantasy or sci-fi couldn't have tasteful covers, so for my books I'm going kinda against the grain with the cover.
