 But still, he paid the same amount of money for the same car, warranty, and loan that a 21 year old would get, so he should be allowed to get a loaner as well.

 Not too different from that time when I saw a group of teenagers, three boys and two girls, walk up to a 1970s Trans Am they saw in a parking lot and the girls took turns posing on the hood and taking pictures of each other.

 Without hard mode, this is just too easy and looks like a piece of cake to begin with since this car is German made. 



















 If I were driving the pooprah or box vic, I would be pleasantly surprised if someone said either was cool. Most people don't pay much attention to those types of cars.

Edit: Does anyone make Men in Black, Sabotage, Blues Brothers 2000, or Matlock references when they see the Vic?

 Just another shitty article with a clickbait title. 




 Fastback Coupe. The Bentley Continental GT and 2015 Ford Mustang are modern cars with this body style. 




 For some reason I didn't think his response was "pretty much explaining it" and thought the question made sense. When I think "unpopular opinion" I think of an opinion that most people may not agree with but can understand why somebody may think that way (e.g. Communism works). When I think "fringe opinion" I think of an opinion that would make most people respond with something along the lines of "are you fucking serious?" (e.g. President Obama is actually a space alien). I was trying to ask where to draw the line between something that is not widely agreed with and something that is considered ridiculious.

Edit: I think I just answered my own question. If an opinion would make the overwhelming majority of people say you were nuts or doesn't make sense, or is extreme it is "lunatic fringe", but if a good number of sane people would agree with it and make positive arguments in favor, but not the majority, it is simply unpopular/fringe.

 I understand that I might the flamed because you may assume that since this post is about Justin Bieber it must be a troll, but that is not the case. If you look at the recklessness, idiocy, and entitlement that Bieber has exhibited and the paths that many has been celebrities go down, I wouldn't be surprised. On top of that it is relatively rare for a teen idol pop star to have fame that lasts for decades to come. 

Think about MC Hammer, another pop star who became rich and famous while still young and went into multi million dollar debt after splurging on mansions, cars, and other luxuries a few years after his peak, or Lenny Dykstra, the arrogant Major League Baseball player who formed a series of unsuccessful businesses after his retirement and resorted to credit card fraud, car theft, and stealing his seized possessions after going bankrupt. Has been celebrities, expensive lifestyles, and entitlement are not a good combination. 




 You're probably right unless he does some other stupid shit shortly after and goes back to prison. It will be 23 years since the murder and car chase, 20 years since the murder trial, so many if not most people will either not care or be too young to remember what happened. 




 Any details about this? 









 1980 Mercedes 300D. Was for sale right around the corner from my house. They said it was too old (this was last year), rusty, and expensive to maintain. 




 I wouldn't be that upset, they haven't aged well IMO.

 Mandatory use of car seats and the advent of child locks made it uncomfortable and unnecessacary for parents of young children to drive them around in two-door cars. Sales of non sport/luxury 2-door coupes really plummetted in the 80's because of this. 














 1974-79 Buick Skylark. Similar to the Chevy Nova, Pontiac Ventura, and Oldsmobile Omega.

 I looked it up and Wikipedia did say that the 1.0 Yaris has 70 hp, but according to some of the answers to a question I asked on this sub once, many Germans are able to make it onto the Autobahn in low hp vehicles.

 Their White population has been in decline for years, but I guess "nonexistent by 2050" is probably too much of an exaggeration. According to [this article]( http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/number-of-whites-in-steady-decline-1.1223994#.VWuSoP3JDcs), it is predicted to be 20% lower than in 2010 by 2040. However, unless there is a big economic boom and South Africa becomes developed like a European country, I don't see how the number of Whites over there can do anything other than decline. 









 Geo Metro, 85-00 Corollas, Buick Century, Ford Escort 




 Racism (either their own or directed towards them), crime, unemployment, and poverty will make all the Whites leave by then. 

Edit: This would probably apply to most other African nations with a sizeable White population as well. 




 A repeat of Pussy Riot may happen, but that's about it. 




 Probably not in our lifetimes. Germany still feels incredibly guilty for the Holocaust. 




 and salt water vs. fresh water makes a big difference. On some car forum I remember once reading a thread about a guy who unwittingly bought a Katrina Corvette, but lucked out because it turned out that it had actually come from an unaffected area of New Orelans where the previous owner flooded it with a garden hose to scam money out of the insurance company.

 A few questions about this happening that I can think of,

1. Will this change the "face" of Islamic terrorism?

2. How will this effect the spread of ISIS influence to the rest of Europe?

3. Could ISIS cause another war in the Balkans?

 Looks like psychotic Hillary Clinton and a talking movie dog. 




 On another site, it said that when the victim's body was prepared for burial, his face was reattached. 









 I don't think this was done by Baumeister, though it has been incorrectly attributed to him online. Baumeister was a gay serial killer who picked male victims up at bars, he never murdered his father.

 Considering that at this point self driving cars seem to be at least 50% hype, I still see a good chance that in 10-15 years we will see the continuing advancement of electronic driver assist features, but a fully autonomous car will be a broken promise of sorts. A practical one that actually functions in all situations and environments and won't get hacked or glitch up is very distant if it will ever come. 




 Looks like it has drag queen makeup on. 




 There's a few articles I saw, but they are all in German.

 I would consider his view to be valid in Europe. 




 This type of car is becoming less common and seems to still lag behind older models and European counterparts in terms of collectibility. They are overlooked as an attainable way to enter the classic car hobby.

 I just realized that there is a GMC Sierra and a Ford Sierra. One is a large American pickup truck, the other was a European family sedan and hatchback. 









 Where's the performance-luxury fighter? (that approach worked pretty well for Cadillac).

There was the 300 SRT8 up until last year. 




 The name and look is like something designed by Rockstar Games. 




 Are you the Jeep driver's defense attorney? 




 They were in the 70s and 80s. 




 [This is the first thing I thought of,](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2015/2267447154_ebf4cd2633_z.jpg?zz=1) it's at the Hard Rock Caf in Orlando. 




 There isn't anything I can think of that makes them exceptionally terrible cars, but their sales seem to lag far behind Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, and Lexus.

Edit: Maybe its the current lack of a compact to compete with the 3 Series, C-Class, A4, and IS. 




 GMC, they're mostly just redundant rebadged Chevys at this point. Kind of like Mercury during its last few years. 




 The new Continental concept, with its limousine like back seat and Bentley inspired styling looks like it might be promising.

 On reddit, on another site, or in person? If so, why? 









 Also, many POS cars tend to look better than they actually are in pictures. I know that there were factory authorized conversions and assumed this was one without really looking too closely. 









 I never did this, but I see other drivers do it all the time in my area, though I have always thought it would be illegal. It usually happens on main roads going through town where they will basically use the shoulder as if it is a turning lane to get around straight moving traffic that is stopped. 




 Why do half of the cars on this sub look like they are early 2000s timewarps? 




 I actually think this is a pretty well done conversion, though I wouldn't choose it if I were in the market for a G-body. 









 He's not high, he's just a tinfoil hatter. Look further at some of his other posts and you'll see. 




 Which I guess means it will drop in value significantly after being discontinued and then be beat to hell or dilapidated by a new group of owners who buy it because it will be a late model car available in large numbers for cheap which can be financed with no credit. 




 I decided to ask one question for all four since they are all in the Balkans and thought that asking individually would be cumbersome.

Edit: Forgot to include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo. 




 or they've been stolen. 




 Like the Golf GTD or M550d. 




 I don't see too many Golfs from before the mid 2000s anymore, so that might be a good predictor for newer cars. Same with Jettas, but interestingly, B5 Passats seem to still be holding up. 




 Even if gas prices stay low? 




 Pretty much all the late 70s-80s large American cars (e.g. Chevy Caprice, Ford LTD, Dodge Diplomat) were still common 5-10 years ago depending on where you went, but now they are becoming a rare sight. 









 Up until about five years ago, Lexus LS400s were still all over the place around here. Now I don't see them that often. 




 I was kind of thinking that since Castro's death will most likely coincide with the current thawing of U.S.-Cuba relations, it will mark a symbolic end of an era for Cuba. 









 A car that I once forgot existed.
