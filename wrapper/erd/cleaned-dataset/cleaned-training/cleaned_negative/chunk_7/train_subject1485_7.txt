 I'm surprised the BBC allowed a Reddit screencap with that particular comment about Islam! 














 I think the difference is that she has already graduated and therefore the university cannot do much directly. It's the Student's Union that is being hateful by continuing to employ her.

I wonder if there are other options open to the University, if they can't discipline her directly and if the SU refuses to do the right thing then perhaps they could just ban her from campus? 





























 Here's an alternative report: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-32781942 












































 Yes. More good news from the recent election.

 Here's a fairly recent case they didn't prosecute: http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/woman-who-made-false-allegation-6661309 

A huge amount of wasted police time and the false arrest of three men. They gave the false accuser a 90 fine! 




   GMP has never prosecuted a victim for making a false allegation'

If the allegations are clearly false then why are they described as a "victim". No rape happened so what exactly were they a "victim" of? 




 Here's a fairly recent case they didn't prosecute: http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/woman-who-made-false-allegation-6661309 



















 They always outline the reason on the certificate so just click on the link to that. 









 Found this story via a Greater Manchester Police Twitter feed. They're the ones who refuse to prosecute false rape accusers and have never done so as stated here: https://web.archive.org/web/20150517211511/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/15/behind-the-scenes-at-a-police-rape-team-bbc-documentary 


































 Go defend child sex abuse somewhere else. 









 What if there was a belief system involving cutting kids arms off, or ears? 




 Some openly oppose it, others just try to sabotage the legislation and come up with random esxcuses why it shouldn't happen. The best known case is opposition to hared parenting by the National Organization of Women in the US (one of the biggest feminist organisations in the world):

https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/20980-as-it-was-and-ever-shall-be-now-opposes-equal-rights-for-fathers

http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/opposing-shared-parenting-the-feminist-track-record/

The good news is that exposes of the track record of such groups has led to them purging the proof of their opposition to equal parenting rights from their websites, so they do at least seem to be becoming ashamed of that fact they openly opposed shared parenting 




 They already did ask him and he doesn't want it to happen. The court has ordered the surgery against his will. 









 Fine, so an adult can get circumcised if their family has a history of foreskin cancer (something that doesn't exist).

I still don't see why you want to mutilate and abuse kids so badly. 




 You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. There are at least four distinct types of FGM, some of which are more severe than MGM and others which re in fact less severe.


All forms of FGM are illegal, including the least severe ones. in fact even a ceremonial pin prick is against the law.
 




 When on earth are healthy breasts removed? A breast reduction is performed to reduce back pain when the breasts are too large. They wouldn't be against removing a foreskin that is for some reason 20 times longer than it should be and it causing some sort of health problem as a result. 




  you ignored the multiple healthy body part procedures listed

All of which grow back when trimmed. 




 They support shared parenting, which is something strongly opposed by most feminist groups.

Their only other good policy with any sort of gender link is to fund STEM university students, which will benefit more males than females (though perhaps not for long if the education system continues on its current feminised path). 









  if parents have the choice to abort a fetus and completely deny the child the right to live their life, how is trimming a bit of penis skin off an issue?

So genital mutilation is ok becasue abortion is also allowed? Female fetuses get aborted too you know, presumably FGM is cool too? Also if we can abort fetuses then why not kill the baby when it's a week old too right? 




 He obviously meant any **healthy** body part. No one is opposed to removing diseased/damaged foreskins (or tumors etc) 



















  I think I finally met a Tory politician I like.

Same here, though the problem is that he's very much a Tory rebel rather than the norm. I expect he'd be popular with the grass roots of the party, the problem is that those in charge are mostly nothing like him really.


The fact that they've got one really good MP doesn't really make the rest of them any less shitty and out of touch with reality (though it does help a little that he's got a position of at least some importance).

It's also noteworthy that Raab has barely mentioned gender issues in the 4 years that have passed since he made these comments. I guess the various attacks from Labour, the BBC and the left are quite effective at silencing people from speaking uncomfortable truths. 









 Lost of disgusting comments here making fun of child abuse or mocking normal male anatomy.

On the plus side people are upvoting the story and so at least most people support the protests. 





























 It was more of a rebuttal of her comments and her myopic assesment of world history. 




 There's actually a long history of Africans invading small English and Irish coastal towns, abducting the population and taking them back home to use as slaves: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_slave_trade 




 More good news from the General Election, seems like a genuinely great guy. 









 Didn't think this article was their best work, but I've actually noticed their London branch actually has some quite talented writers and thinkers.

There's been a very noticeable decline in the quality of newspapers here, the latest example being the Telegraph which haemorrhaged almost every single one of its best writers over the last few years. It has gone from perhaps the best UK newspaper as recently as 2008-10 to an average publication today. Therefore new developments such as the launch of Breitbart London are extremely welcome. 




 That's becasue people like this either end up in politics or obtain influential positions in the media. The progression of idiots from senior National Union of Student' positions to roles within the UK Labour Party is basically automatic these days. 




 I hope you mean the Youtube OP and not me. I'm completely against sexism against both men and women and would never deny that either could exist. 









 Some news coverage of her statement: http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/goldsmiths-university-diversity-officer-in-racism-row-i-cant-be-racist-because-im-an-ethnic-minority-woman-10243202.html 














 Someone has tagged this as **"Old story, 1st reported weeks ago".**

It's true that the original racist/sexist incident was weeks ago, but this is a new report, which outlines her response to the allegations of racism and sexism. I.e. it is a brand new development, with a number of different outlets all picking it up today.

**Please remove this misleading flair**. Thanks.

 




 It will still be better than her speech though. 









 There are rare cases of politicians campaigning to help men and fix men's issues. Can't think of any off the top of my head in the US, though I expect people at NCFM or the National Parents Organization would know a few.

Of course, most areas will have zero pro men's human rights candidates, though it's still worth doing your research. Furthermore, if there's a misandrist feminist standing in your area (or perhaps a pro-MGM religious nutjob) then please just go out and vote for any of their opponents.

 So the BBC finally let Ray on air, though only 24 hours before the polls opened!

I expect this broadcast wouldn't have happened at all were it not for everyone's complaints and the significant interest in BBC Nottingham's bias. 









 Not sure if there's a men's rights angle to this yet or not, though Twitter is known to partner with radical feminists to censor content so I'd expect there is. Most filters tend to disadvantage the freedom of speech of men's human rights advocates, so even if the radical feminists haven't been involved I'd still expect there to be issues for us to deal with here. 









 Labour still beats the Lib Dems hand down when it comes to misandry.

Two of their equality ministers (harman and Hewitt) were found guilty of sexism against men, with one also given repeated official warnings from the statistics authority for lying about the gender pay gay.

I'd say the misandry of Labour's Vera Baird alone matches everything the Lib Dems have. 




 Jo Swinson got booted out too, she's someone who thought men should pay more for insurance for being men. 









 She has a long history of feminist anti-male sexism. Easily the highlight of the election results. More on here MGM comments: http://equality4men.com/2013/09/18/featherstone-proves-she-is-uks-most-sexist-against-men-mp-with-crass-comments-about-boys-willies/ 









 An agenda to ensure doctors don't harm patients? That's certainly true, I don't deny that, I'm fully against the mutilation of kids but I have plenty of other medicine related interests too. I would hope most here have the same opposition to doctors harming kids, though given only 44% upvoted this post then perhaps not... 









 I have a variety of interests and expertise relating to medicine. Areas include cancer, genital mutilation, mental health.

Apologies if I've posted too much on any one of these and not enough on others of late, but I don't have any agenda relating to any one topic and this particular link is clearly of huge value to this community. 









 I wonder is the "Survivors Manchester" organisation is actually trying to get this problem fixed? I couldn't see anything on the website about the need to sort out the definition of rape (though I only read through a few pages). 









 Actually that's **exactly** how it works: http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/07.20/10-deathquiz.html 




 If a woman reaches the age of 70 then they've got a decent chance of making it past 82. I'll admit I did forget that female life expectancy was as low as 82 there, in other countries it tends to be nearer 84 for women. 




 She'll be 70 if she serves her whole sentence (and I bet that doesn't happen anyway). Even if she get released as late as aged 70, well that's not especially old these days, particularly if you're a woman. 




 Wouldn't a life sentence have been more appropriate? 




 In legal matters there's a commonly used Latin expression which is as follows: **"Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius"**. This translates to "The expression of one thing is the exclusion of another."

Such an expression might not be of much relevance were there numerous parties ignored by De Piero, or if there was another excuse or it it was sheer forgetfulness (for example if Mike hadn't showed p to the count or if she didn't know his name/party). However, Mike went out of his way to target De Piero and highlight her misandry and it's pretty obviously she's deliberately chosen the words she used. Even if she was so bitter an childish that she had decided against acknowledging him specifically she could have said " Helen, or Philip, or Simon and others" then that would have been ok. This didn't happen and therefore it's more than reasonable to assume she's against helping anyone who voted for J4MB unless she says otherwise.

 














  Is he stupid enough to think that gay men and lesbian women are all just one big borg?

The author is actually also 100% homosexual himself. 









 The photobomber is campaigning for the rights of fathers and their children. 




 Mike has clearly made an impact if she's not only shunning him but also anyone who dared to vote for him. She actually has a legal obligation to work on behalf of everyone who lives in the constituency. 









 Interesting that Mike's opponent appears to be refusing to represent any constituents who voted for Justice for Men and Boys! He's certainty made an impact there for her to have shunned the party's voters in such a way. 




 That's a third party listing which happens to use Amazon's site. I was talking about products actually sold/stocked and hence endorsed by Amazon.

There's a big difference between some random person putting something up for sale on Amazon and the company itself actually choosing to sell it. 




 Under UK law "Rape" can only be committed by men. I'd assume the police are using the same sexist and exclusionary definition and therefore this campaign is focusing on the minority of males raped by other men. 




 The problem is the double standard. All the content the feminists find particularly objectionable has already been removed from sale. So we're now in a situation where Amazon will only sell material inciting gender based violence if the victims are male. 









 Amazon is one of the few remaining retailers that insists on selling the "Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them" books

Complaints to david.holdsworth@bbc.co.uk 





























 The BBC has a legal obligation to be 100% impartial becasue of the way it is funded. If other organisations act as badly as the BBC, then it's still actually a far less serious issue becasue of the differing legal obligations. 




 Mike's a better writer than he is a broadcaster. His colleague Ray Barry is the best at handling tv/radio though of course the BBC have refused to let him on air in the last couple of months. 




 So, would you care to show us a recent BBC broadcast showing J4MB interacting with someone who isn't female?

People forget just how powerful the BBC are, they have 70% share of UK tv news. 




 Exactly, even some in the men's rights community don't even support Buchanan. This story is about one of the most blatant breaches of the BBC Charter imaginable. It's about journalism, not any political party. 




 This is clearly related to journalism ethics and the BBC clearly has an agenda. Just yesterday the published the most incredibly biased article about Joss Whedon: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32591260 




 As requested I'm resubmitting this with a better title to illustrate exactly what's happened and what the new developments are in this story.

Apologies for not choosing a better title first time.

Can we put some pressure on the BBC management to investigate this? 



















 Perhaps I should resubmit with a better title? 




 No it's far worse than that. Remeber, the questions were mostly about helping women.

Therefore in your analogy, every discussion would involve the right-wing candidate being forced to discuss how best to further the policies and goals of the left.

The BBC rigged not just the audience, but the questions too! 




 The development to previous posts about this story is that the BBC have admitted to imposing the all-female audience on J4MB entirely deliberately. 









  fair treatment is making sure that you only get asked on your specialist topics in front of your preferred audience?

No, that's the problem becasue it's exactly what happened to the Labour candidate isn't it? 




  Yes, how dare the BBC not give proper time to a fringe party that will not get any seats.

Did you even read the article. They've already given a load of praise to a fringe party that isn't' even standing yet.

Furthermore, it's not really about airtime at all, but fair treatment. Had the BBC given 10 times a more coverage to J4MB than they did but continuing with the same spin and bias then everyone would have exactly the same concerns.

 WNBA teams are usually owned by their NBA counterparts. 














 It was probably true 60 years ago. 














 It barely gets any attention from anyone, but the only significant discrimination I can think of is the lack of HPV vaccine for boys.

It's far from exclusively an LGBT issue of course, and almost all aspect of men's health are underlooked/ignored by most politicians. However, of the 2,000 male lives every year, gay/bi men would be massively over represented.

Shame we don't see the LGBT lobby up really focus on this instead of the insignificant issues that do get attention. 




 That's Sandi Toksvig, author of "girls are best". 




 All the abusive comments listed with any sort of gendered angle are directed at men, yet somehow even her opponent spins it as sexism again women. Wouldn't vote for either of them if I lived there. 




 So, Toksvig is an "equality" campaigner yet somehow also the author of a book titled "girls are best". 




 So Sandi Toksvig is going to lead an "equality party" whilst also being the author of the book "Girls are best". 




 Is this the same Sandi Toksvig campaigning for "equality" who also authored a book titled "Girls are best"? 




  Politicians won't support the MRM, but they will look at specific issues (especially if they're cheap to back).

Almost all men's issues are cheap to back or even have a significant gain for taxpayers. The government clearly hates men, otherwise they'd have implemented the cost saving ones ages ago just to save cash.

* Getting rid of MGM (actually makes money for the NHS in cost savings)
* Fixing family courts (basically free and saves money in legal costs)
* Shared parenting (free, though loses the CSA their cut of child support) 




 SNP are worse than the Lib Dems for sexism against men, I'd bet there are 3 or 4 Lib Dems in the country who are well worth voting for, but zero for the SNP. 




 Remember, **you can get rid of your tv licence and still legally watch BBC iPlayer**. A lot of people don't know about this loophole. The licence fee only covers live broadcasts. 




 Yes, shame they can't be more neutral. Most of their policies are neither left nor right-wing in nature really so it seems a shame for them to describe themselves in such a way. 




 J4MB are standing in two constituencies (was originally three) and plan to contest 50 next time around. The other candidate wasn't invited to his own hustings debate, therefore making this far worse than you suggest.

Also, I don't see why boys get their genitals mutilated without their consent (and at taxpayer expense) whilst females get protected by law. That's probably the party's strongest policy and it gets huge support. 




 Ray's your candidate, not Mike. Try watching some videos of him instead (even Mike admits that ray's the better speaker of the two).

Ray has been a regular on the tv show "The Big Questions" every so often. 




 Good point, though most of the MPs in that area would be SJW sympathisers too.

Also, if enough people email multiple staff the BBC, then we can win. Not everyone there is a complete asshole (and even some that are do realise when the organisation has gone much too far). 




 Ray Barry wasn't allowed to attend the BBC Broxtowe hustings. A shame really, he comes across as very knowledgeable and above all else really compassionate.

Are you saying you'd like to have a chat with him or meet him to get to know more about the party? Or have they already got your vote? 




  Why did they do that? I don't understand what this is supposed to accomplish.

They obviously don't like the party so decided to do everything within their powers to intimidate its members and sabotage their election campaign? The BBC is well know for it's left-wing SJW bias, though this particular example is particularly blatant even by their standards.
 




 Good point, though I thought they counted each women as half a man? 




 A few questions I asked in my complaint:

1. What is your organisation's justification for banning men (and the discussion of their issues) from only UK hustings on the BBC to feature the political party in the western world representing the human rights of men and boys? Do you at least now accept it was clearly a mistake to do so?

2. Why couldn't a non J4MB seat be chosen instead?

3. Which member(s) of staff were responsible for imposing this gender based discrimination at such an historic event?

4. Why was Ray Barry not invited to his own hustings? Who was responsible for failing to send out his invites? Was this bias a deliberate act or supposedly a mistake?

5. When can we expect to see a men-only hustings discussing men's issues on BBC Nottingham prior to the 2015 General Election in order to ensure fairness and gender balance in your output?

6. When will Ray Barry get his chance to appeal to voters on BBC Radio Nottingham before the election?

7. How many members of staff at BBC Nottingham have a gender-feminist political outlook and are therefore naturally hostile towards the human rights of men and boys and/or J4M B? Did any of the individuals who are hostile or dismissive of J4MB have any role in this scandal?

8. Why was the very existence of J4M B portrayed as a problem on the Midlands Daily Politics broadcast? Why was Ray Barry yet again airbrushed out of existence?

9. When will we finally see the party engaging on-air with its supporters or at least the very many supporters of its ideas?

10. You all follow various political parties and local political personalities on Twitter, yet not a single one of you follow someone as high profile as Mike Buchanan. How do you expect to keep your listeners informed of stories relating to local politics if you're all blatantly ignoring one the the area's most significant political figures, someone who attracts global interest?

11. Have you apologised to Mike and Ray for the horrendous mistreatment of them and their party by BBC Radio Nottingham? If not when are you going to apologise? (I'd suggest doing so publicly, on air and BEFORE the election, not afterwards).

12. When are you also going to apologise to your male listeners for denying them a voice?

 




 There are 649 other constituencies where the BBC will also have held hustings debates. I can't find a single other case of a single sex audience at at on of them. 




 OK, fair enough. 




 It doesn't matter what their political position is, the BBC have clearly attempted to sabotage their election prospects.

Secondly, ignoring the slight Conservative bias, the fact is that 75% of the manifesto is mostly spot on and covers hugely important equality issues that get sept under the carpet. Furthermore, if there's specific media and entertainment industry ethics issues you'd want them to cover, or any mistakes you've spotted, then drop them a line in a couple of weeks. They do tend to be quite receptive to feedback.

 That's a kind offer, the thirst for activism and gettings things done on this subreddit is really admirable. Some email addresses:

* mike.bettison@bbc.co.uk (BBC Nottingham editor)
* philip.chapman@bbc.co.uk (BBC Nottingham editor)
* David.Holdsworth@bbc.co.uk (in charge of all local radio)

 




 Plenty of other media ethics posts here of late. 




 Note that they also rigged most of the questions so they were about women's issues, therefore preventing J4MB from discussing its manifesto.

They also held a second (mixed gender) debate in the constituency of the second J4MB candidate, though they didn't actually bother to invite him to take part! (and he's their best speaker)

**Therefore the BBC has completely banned men in from any interaction whatsoever with the only men's party in the UK.**

The BBC is funded by a compulsory licence fee, and as a result is duty-bound to be impartial. What they have done breaks countless BBC editorial guidelines and it's blatantly obvious that they have directly interfered in the apolitical process and attempted to sabotage the campaign of a party who's views they disagree with.
