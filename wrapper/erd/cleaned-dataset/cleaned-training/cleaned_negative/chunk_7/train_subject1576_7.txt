 Of course, you realize that the President of the United States is the President of the United States 24/7.  The problem with the Kasich situation is that we the Ohio voters elected him to do one job; and, on our dime he is abandoning his job to run for another office.   














 I get up every morning at an early hour.  After a shower, feeding the pets, and making a pot of coffee to leave by my wife's bedside table I head out to my local Starbucks where I read the New York Times and hang out with my pal aka, the Dude.  The two of us have become such an institution at this SBUX that we've made tons of sober friends, SBUX regulars, and even networked various business deals including recently introducing an orthopedic surgeon to his new medical practice--just by hanging out and learning the names of regulars.  




 Good for you, please keep doing what you're doing. 




 Congratulations, you have a running start on a whole new way of life.   




 Thanks for this insight. 




 Exactly right. 




 I've been there, but by continuing not to drink it got better and it got better pretty quickly.  









 That sounds just like my "adventure in moderation" after 15 continuous years of sobriety.  After two weeks I descended into a 7 year hell-on-earth relapse.  I am truly grateful to be a month away from my 6 year anniversary, again.  I did it one day at a time.  




 There are lots of living examples of this right on this sub. 




 Good job on telling on yourself.  I hope this was cathartic for you.  If I were you, I would focus ENTIRELY on recovery for the next 90 days and listening.  Noon and early evening AA meetings work for me. 




 I'm so glad you are choosing to begin again.  I am not drinking TODAY in solidarity with you. 




  My own prison was in a bottle, my own dark thoughts were the razor wire, I don't want to go back there either.

This reminds me so much of the Harriet Tubman quote, I paraphrase: I freed a thousand slaves, I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew that they were slaves. 







































 "Hedge" really sounds like he's saying: I love my wife, but her in-laws can stay out. 



















 Not a problem, didn't see it. 





























 Yeah, the Massey Energy CEO, Don Blankenship bought chunks of the WV Supreme Court just to win a civil lawsuit.  He loved it! 




 Hey, /u/SoggyAugi -- I wrote a "what's next" post [called the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  The Baby Steps are entirely based on my personal experience, but lots of us on /r/stopdrinking use these ideas in our own ways to find a path.  Good luck to you. 




 Nothing bad in my life, nothing at all--was ever improved by adding alcohol.  I have been at the precipice, and by choosing to not drink my life got better.  I feel for you, brother.  Hang in there. 




 He had remarkable insights and he was a deeply compassionate teacher. 












































 Yeah, this is how I make the distinction between interest and commitment.  I am committed to my daily decision not to drink TODAY, so I doggedly persist.  I am interested in playing my guitar, and too many days in a row it merely sits at my elbow...condemning me, LOL. 




 I saw Father Martin, live at the Cleveland Masonic Auditorium back in the late 1980s, what a hoot.   




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; keeping Thursday SOBER in Cleveland.   
























 Welcome /u/Leaping_ezio to r/stopdrinking.  At this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Maybe you will find some ideas there that will be helpful to you.  Good luck. 




 My body and my central nervous system were healing for the first month or so.  It makes some logical sense that you might be feeling nausea in the early days sober.  The healthy gut bacteria may be rebuilding its biome in the GI.  If you continue to have symptoms, by all means go see a licensed professional. 




 When I stopped drinking in both 1986 and then later in 2009 I found psychological counseling invaluable to addressing anger and other troubling issues.  I'm grateful that I had the resources available to me at that time to obtain counseling. 




 Good work.  You might also [do the morning check-in with us.](http://is.gd/afsucks)

 Wow, that's terrific!  I am so proud of you.

 I was sentenced to federal prison about a year after I returned to sobriety in August 2010.  I had been a nationally prominent civil trial lawyer with a business worth potential millions.  I was disgraced and fearful and miserable and I didn't drink.  I didn't drink the day I was sentenced or any day since that time by doing what I talk about all the time: I made a daily decision not to drink TODAY and I doggedly persisted.  No single event, no bad news or good, no sadness, no disappointment, no loss is too great to bear for one day.  Then I repeat, tomorrow.  

My life is filled with happiness, joy, and freedom because of the decision I make TODAY not to drink.   














 That one was really my bad, I intended to send that to whole other subreddit.   




 Yes, but why are the citizens of Ohio funding our Gov's run for another political office.  Security for a presidential run is a whole lot more involved and expensive than for a vacation for a non-presidential candidate.  I think then SC Gov. Mark Sanford proved that. 




 Well, then again, there's that. 




 I think it's a mistake to think just because someone makes money they can't also be an idiot or politically and socially unacceptable.  Trump falls into that category in my opinion.  He is beyond the pale.   




 There are also online meetings: [here](http://www.aa-intergroup.org/directory_venue.php?code=AV) and [here.](http://www.aaonline.net/) 









 OK, I'm glad I asked.  

Personally, I am not that different than you in terms of the underlying anxiety issues and to be honest, even though I live in a major American city (Cleveland) AA can be a little like high school from the standpoint of early sobriety.  On the other hand, given some blind courage and a gritting commitment to just go and actively listen my entire life (including my bipolar disorder) changed positively for the better.  Also, most of my preconceptions even about how I would be received were completely mistaken.  This has been my experience with AA everywhere I've gone over 30 years.  

Go it alone didn't work for me, but it may work for you.  Good luck, and I hope you will consider keeping /r/stopdrinking for support. 



















 Good for you, /u/Trunner3000.  Preparation is ACTION and personally, I found acting my way into better thinking worked a whole lot better than trying to think my way into better acting. 




 Congratulations, /u/cake_or_radish on 345 days!!!

 Why is AA bullshit (in your city)? 



















 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping hump day SOBER in Cleveland. 




 This is great progress.  Too often newcomers in the throes of early sobriety give up hope of feeling better but you are am example that even a couple of weeks cam be huge.  Keep doing what you're doing
 




 Great to hear from you, GS.  Don't be a stranger if you can help it. 




 I have so many activities that 24 hours is insufficient to the purpose, but I do remember that time in early sobriety when I felt at loose ends--what now?--I asked myself. I jumped into AA meetings and activities, that was huge.  Then I asked myself what did I always want to do.  In my case I always wanted to play guitar, so I signed up for an adult education class, then private lessons, and then I joined a group.  It was great.  I resumed avid cycling and I joined a cycling group for weekly night rides.  I joined a sober bowling and gold league.  My life was soon overwhelmed with activities. 




 I actually did some of the pioneering law in this area in the US.  In my experience families are universally viewed as the victims of abuse; although in one instance I represented a family who came into possession of photographic evidence of abuse and who turned over the evidence to prosecutors only to be charged with possession of "child porn."  The charges would in due course be dismissed, but I suppose it goes some to prove your point. 














 I've read extensively in the Orange Papers and while the obsessiveness of Agent Orange is remarkable, the work is poisoned by the sort of thinking that has no actual meaning or purpose other than to air out Orange's grievance and crap all over other's recovery.  As SM2L says, it has nothing at all to do with my experience in recovery.   




 Or maybe just truing. 




 They should be smoking. 



















 Welcome /u/BlackDogBlues66 to /r/stopdrinking -- at the [link is a post that sets out some "next steps"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) for the newly sober that are based on something my AA sponsor called "baby steps."  I hope you feel motivated to check-in regularly on the sub and keep us posted on your progress. 




 Ah, I'm sorry, /u/equallyconfusing that you find yourself in this sad situation.  I've been there in so many ways and for me it always began with the first drink.  I had to stop drinking, [the Baby Steps are how I did it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Then I needed sustained time sober, finally I needed RECOVERY which gave me a systematic way of making the appropriate amends to those I hurt.  Until I did all those ACTIONS, my words were worthless.   














 Maybe a week or two at most. 




 Hey, /u/thenewmeihope -- this is what I call "writing checks drunk, that sober I can't cash."  It's OK. It's more than OK if you draw the lesson you're drawing.  Down the road, maybe you can make amends, but for the time being, let it go works best in my experience. 




 After 15 continuous years of sobriety, I went back out to drink moderately.  I was successful too, for 2 weeks.  Then I descended into the deepest, darkest hole.  It took many years and it was only by some miracle not of my doing that I was able to come back to life in 2009.   Nope, not for me.  




 Wow, powerful stuff that.   




 Interesting, but I don't think the medical and mental health communities are at all focused on the "spiritual entity" part of recovery when they make the recommendation to attend AA meetings.  I think instead they realize that AA meetings are the most easily accessible, affordable, and effective programs of recovery.  

And might one, just "skip the middle man" and just go right to some conception of God?  If that were true there would be no drunk Roman Catholic priest, LOL!  In my experience, it is not a religious zeal, or spirituality that is at the heart of the recovery from alcoholism--it is instead an appreciation that ALCOHOL is the higher power and self will or will power alone can not in the usual case, beat the disease.  Instead a core recognition that the power of fellowship with like-minded others who are on a sober journey IS the solution.  From time immemorial, religious "cures" had been proposed and failed.  AA grew up as a radical reaction against the "moral" cure of the Women's Temperance Union, the Baptist pledge, and the Oxford Group.   




 I slipped through a changing light the other day in a retail district of my town.  The Honda from the side street that I passed on my right pulled up beside me and the passenger rolled her window down and said, "You give all bicyclists a bad name."  I replied, "Yeah, that's a shame, but even people on bicycles make mistakes, though I'm sure you never do."  Let's not all pretend that every action or inaction is from a place of malice or arrogance. 




 Well-said.   




 Great and powerful post, /u/rose_the_wolf.  I am majorly pulling for you friend. 




 Let's do this, CR! 




 Welcome to our sub, /u/heyizabella (Isabella was my fav cat)--so at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.  I hope to see you checking-in daily. 




 Good for you! 




 I think there is pretty good evidence that in early sobriety coffee is a net positive.  It's frankly why one of the symbols of AA is the coffee pot. 




 I toughed it out; because my brain, my body, my central nervous system were healing and the experience of others told me that it would take a little time before I reached equilibrium.   




 I totally agree.  This isn't support, it's purchase. 




 Did you ever read my /r/stopdrinking [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Why don't you come join us on that sub?  We are actively taking action to stop drinking. 




 Seriously, folks, don't screw the clients. 


































 The discipline I imposed on myself in my early AA was to go, listen and listen actively to each person without judgment.  It didn't take me long to see myself in many aspects of what others said and to learn some discernment skills, taking what helped and leaving the rest behind.  The mere action of going, and listening was all that I needed in the first days and weeks.   




 You are on the verge of being eligible to do the morning check-in if you're interested! 




 Outstanding, I've been off for several days around the holiday, too.  I go back to work tomorrow and I agree, the time off has been wonderful. 




 Welcome /u/silkslittedsheets to /r/stopdrinking -- if you've been in "lurk" you may or may not have come across the [Baby Steps link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I'm convinced based on some feedback that the Baby Steps are not a bad place to start stopping.  One of the things that I've also found very useful is the sub's Daily Check-in.  It's turning into a running narrative for a lot of us as we go along.  Good luck. 




 I'll do more than wish you luck; I'll share [the Baby Steps link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) with you in the hope that something that worked for me will resonate with you and help as you go along. 




 This observation about speakers trying to convince themselves that AA works, may be true.  Remember, as they say in recovery "De-nile (denial) is not a river in Egypt" and in early recovery we are often still awkwardly selling ourselves on recovery.  Embedded in AA recovery is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy--a deliberate focus on changing behaviors in order to change thinking.  I often compare it to learning how to play guitar--which I successfully undertook in early sobriety.  At first it's really hard, awkward, uncomfortable.  Nothing came easily for me.  But as I slowly learned chords, scales, and songs and I practiced my brain automatically sped me up so that I sound pretty good even with my rudimentary skill set.  The same's true for new people in AA.  They may look awkward, or even phony, but let's not judge--in many cases these are the same hopeless, helpless drunks that made little or no sense when we sat on the barstool next to them staring at Sportscenter on the TV over the bar. 









 I would highly suggest that you post at /r/alanon or better yet check out an Al Anon meeting IRL.  This is not a "blow off" my ex-wife's most powerful and loving action--working an Al Anon program--changed her life and mine.  Best of luck to you and the alcoholic in your life. 




 What worked for me were the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  These simple sober actions worked for me and lots of others too, long before I ever came across them and re-worked the ideas for this sub.  So good luck to you, /u/funkhouser1907. 




 Here's the thing about your powerful post; because you have 9 days and are saying these things you have the proximate credibility to be persuasive to newcomers when with some years of sobriety we can say the words and fall on deaf ears.  Congratulations, keep doing what you are doing and you will find your authentic self. 




 My sincerest sympathies, my friend.  My thoughts are with you this morning. 




 But the savings on "product" makes it so worth it. 














 Apparently :D 





























 r/titlegore 









 Anger and resentment are the chief offenders in relapse. 




 Good for you! 




 I describe this self-insight as that moment when I crossed the line from someone who is stopping drinking because it makes sense in light of all the bad consequences; to the ex-drinker who truly values my new sober life.  At this moment in my experience, cravings left me.  As long as I keep putting one foot in front of the other, I am confident I will not drink again. 














 Did you participate in the making of this video?  Hmmmmm... 
























 I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; sober in Cleveland again this morning and off to Starbucks to read the New York Times.  Have a great day, everybody! 









 Cedar Point is an hour from my house.

 The wisdom of labeling alcoholism a disease is this central concept; we have an effective treatment for which we OURSELVES are empowered to address by our daily choices and participation in recovery. 














 So /u/field__notes did you ever read through the [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It's what I do everyday to stop drinking for TODAY, only.  Why not join us on the daily check-in tomorrow morning?  We can all start stopping together. 




 Good luck.  Working with others is the best way to get and stay sober.   




 Welcome /u/titty_sprinkz --thank you for sharing your thoughts about Fernando.  Somebody once pointed out to me that our eyes don't see inward, we need to look to others for our own reflection--that sounds like what you did so powerfully in speaking of Fernando.  So I stopped drinking and I got sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.  Good luck. 




 Absolutely, I didn't mean to pre-empt the debate, but merely lay out my thoughts on the one topic he mentioned in his post.   




 Wow you are in a dark place if I'm reading your post correctly.  I see myself 6 years ago, in your account of where alcohol has you.  I had to get help and stop drinking in order to find true happiness, and my authentic self.  Sustained sober time was an answer to the lies that alcohol was telling me and I got sober doing the simple actions I detail in the [Baby Steps post at this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Let me be clear: I can't be happy drunk when drunk I text others about suicide. That simply is not rational and I suspect you know it or you wouldn't be posting here.  Good luck and keep posting and commenting. 




 Congratulations, /u/Hollow_Ponds -- an invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow unless one of the other DINO mods beat me to it. 




 I just suggested in a comment to another post that the 90 day no drink challenge might be a way to gain some clarity on the issue you're grappling with.  The way I stopped drinking was via [the things I discuss at the Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Why not see if you can arrive at your own answers by simple sober actions for some sustained time without alcohol? 




 If I were you, I would stop drinking for some time, maybe set a goal of 90 days in order to gain clarity around my relationship with alcohol.  I found that my problem wasn't the 3rd or 4th beer or drink, but the first.  My way of stopping goes right to the heart of that problem:  [the Baby Steps are focused on learning how to stop drinking in the here and now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you. 









 It's interesting, almost the entire medical and psychological communities agree that alcoholism is a disease; but, the occasional dissenter when given voice in popular media or by Penn   Teller tends to animate the debate.  It's like the anti-vaxxer-thing in my opinion.  So why is alcoholism NOT a disease in their opinion?  Well, for a variety of reasons almost all of which are highly debatable--but, the big one is: you can't "catch" alcoholism like you can AIDS or Dengue Fever or Small Pox.  But alcoholism isn't an infectious disease (although if you think about it, maybe it is to some extent)--alcoholism or the disorders that we conventionally think of as alcoholism is more like diabetes or heart disease.  Our early life choices, and our genetic predispositions often bring on the disorder.  As far as I am concerned, I may not be responsible for getting my "disease" but I am wholly responsible for daily treatment. 














 Why don't you talk about those things you don't know whether you agree with on this subreddit?  At least we can supportively discuss the issues with you. 




 infrequently 




 Good for you, you have a real running start on a whole new way of living.  Solid insight about the reach of this "disease." 




 I suppose this would be surprising if anyone truly believed that Breitbart was anything more than a crew of rightwing grifters pretending to be hard hitting political journalists. 




 I'm upvoting you. 




 I'll bite, what? 




 How much did you donate? 














 Actually pretty descriptive. 




 Kasich did the same thing in Ohio (it must be an ALEC initiative)--give tax dollars to a secretive bunch of corporate oligarchs ostensibly to "create jobs."  Sweet deal.
