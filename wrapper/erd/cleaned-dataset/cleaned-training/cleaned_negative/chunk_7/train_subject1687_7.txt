 You are a one righteous dude, Jim! 




 Since you're a vet, I highly recommend you contact the Red Cross in SLC and reach their veteran mentoring division. They might have a list of vet friendly companies that could be hiring now. And if you fall on hard times, they can definitely put you in touch with the right people (VA, VSOs, etc).

I work for said division in Provo, so feel free to PM me :) 




 To be frank, they're not that bad. 




 Apocalips Now sounds like a good name for a certain type of movie... 




 They're politically active or work (or want to work) in the non-profit sector. Swoons me instantly. 




 Someone here said they wouldn't date people who enjoy weaving 17th century French baskets. I lost my shit, yo. 




 Yup. The imgur extension for Chrome does this really easily. 




 Besides what others have suggested, you could maybe see if they list certain authors that are related to the arts.  




 The Underground Railroad, though it didn't destroy slavery, certainly aided a lot of people to freedom. And Woman's Suffrage (in the US) worked.    




 Just don't overuse it. It can get annoying if you do that. Otherwise, whatever.  




 Share you profile.  




 I've had work come up and cancel the same date on me twice. It happens.  




 Let him know you know, check to see if he is poly. If he says yes, ask if you can talk to his partner too.   




 Wasn't a priest ;)))) 




 Shop of the Lin Family by Mao Dun. Very short, very poetic. It's a lot of political thought packed into sixty pages.   




 So try and find smaller get together groups. 

There's also volunteering!  




 Not bad! I'd add what hobbies you've been quick to learn, just to make you stand out a little bit. 

Also your dad (?) looks like Ron Paul. I had to do a double take.   




 My church crush gave a speech on honesty and I sat there all starry eyed. Swooned instantly.  




 1. Contact MTV

2. Get on their show Catfish

3. Stalk girl/guy with cameras 

4. ???

5. Profit 




 That's fine. I don't see anything wrong with that. 

 




 My new job with the Red Cross! Weeeee! 




 On a second look, the CBPP's look a little higher than Heritage's, depending on how you define entitlements. 

So are the numbers correct or is something amiss? I always thought the CB was a neutral group, but you seem to be indicating the numbers are different. What sources are you referring to? 




 Which technicalities? 




 Is the CBPP not trustworthy? They show similar numbers. I thought they were a neutral source. 

 http://goo.gl/Lq57Ev

What's wrong with the numbers? Is the CBPP doing their data wrong? Or are they biased (assuming you know since you didn't provide a source)? Thanks!  




 According to the CBPP, the numbers look right: http://goo.gl/Lq57Ev

Am I missing something? Thanks.  




 Yup! I've tutored there for a little bit. It's absolutely awesome. The program does a lot of emphasis on writing creativity. Super fun.   




 They're not socialist, they're social democracies. There's a difference. Capitalism still thrives in Scandanvia.  




 Is their data wrong? I remember reading similar numbers from other sources.  




 Lobbying. I've done it, and now a law I lobbied for is close to becoming law. Feels good.  




 What courses are you taking? 




 Seconded. We need to weaken unions and overturn CU.  




 Can you think of a better way to challenge a well armed military that has tanks, bombs, and battleships? 




 The Twilight series actually has some Christian undertones (more specifically, Mormon ones) relating to marriage and pureness.  




 Bring a book! The outdoors is the perfect place for reading. 




 He has tinnitus, which is a constant ringing in the ear. He apparently got this from working on Star Trek. 

Here he is talking about it: http://youtu.be/E7bL9BhESYA 




 Mormons are okay, but the church is a little not okay. It has way too much influence in politics here in Utah than it should. Not they shouldn't have their say, but they shouldn't try and control the legislature. 

I appreciate Mormons themselves though.  




 Why? 




 Tree fiddy.  




 Anything special about it? Never heard of it.  




 Yes, they're national, but they're only in one or two cities and not spread out across a whole state. I think that makes them kind of local.  




 My best guess is ceremonies and parades. Can't see any other reason.  




 Lynn might be, but Salem and Peabody are definitely not. They're pretty safe and affordable.   




 This is why I moved away from Mass. Too expensive and the job market sucks. Both of those need to change.  




 *Into The Wild* will make you want to drop everything and go hitchhiking across a country.  




 Ah, thought it was Utah. My bad! 




 Here in Provo, Utah (where Google Fiber was first set up), you can get up to a gigabyte for residential and small business, which I'm sure many people use.

I'm jealous of your speeds though! I'd kill for that. 




 It's a way of getting mail and information in your mailbox for your computer, but instead of getting it from overpriced companies which overcharge you, you get it from some local company which is pretty nice to you. 




 My complex provides it for free, so my speeds aren't top notch (5mbps/download, 1mbps/upload), but it is reliable. I've had no issues with it thus far, which is good. A lot of other ISPs will have outages, faulty modems, etc., and I've had none of that. 

So, no complaints from me! But it's nothing outstanding.  









 What's wrong with it? 




 which corporate loopholes Sanders wants to close

Which ones did you mention? 




 If you haven't read him, a lot of works by David Friedman helped me understand their ideas. 




 Which specific tax-loopholes, if closed, would garner the most money for such a feat to be attempted? 




 update? 




 Is there a secret menu I can order from? 









 Thank you! I might apply because of this posting.  




 If we do part-time do we get to make our own schedules?  




 Oldboy (Korean Version) 




 No. But I assume many woman skip over bi men like myself.  




 Purity Ring and Braids at The Depot, Monday! 




 My school (SSU) voted on having them part of our tuition back in 2012/13 




 As said, Cape Cod is pricey and booked in advanced. Though not as scenic, you can try the South Shore (Scituate, Hull, Cohasset), which is a region between Boston and the Cape. These are also coastal towns with plenty of beaches and a few light houses. Cheaper, too. 




 There's some abandoned day care in SLC. Someone posted here inquiring as to what the building actually was, since it still seemed to be maintained, yet no children were ever spotted near the building. /r/conspiracy eventually picked it up, and started an investigation as to what the building was actually being used for. Though most of the text has been removed (due to doxxing the business) here's some discussion about it:

 Just run for office. I did, at only the age of twenty. Didn't win, and didn't intend to win, but it was a starting point.  




 I've only received two out of the blue messages from woman. Responded to both. So...100% response rate? 




 Lots of call centers and a lot of IT type jobs. Construction and trucking seem to be big too. Good amount of NGOs are stationed here if that's your thing. It's really not hard to find something that pays the bills (rent in SLC and the surrounding area is very cheap, like $400/mo for a room). Within a month of moving here I got several interviews and call backs. 

You can check out this site to get a feel for what's available: http://www.ksl.com/jobs 




 If possible, there's always moving. I moved to an area where jobs fall out of the sky. Of course that's not possible for everyone, but if it's an option, take it.

Edit: For reference, I'm in Salt Lake City, where there are "Hiring" billboards and signs dotted across the land. Yes, actual "Hiring" billboards. 




 No, but, if we are to have positions of any sort we must be prepared to defend them. To question ourselves constantly assures us our reasoning is sound. To blindly go around claiming things without knowing what backs them up doesn't make one a good thinker. 




 This is how it is with my new job as well. We're allowed one unexcused day, and after that there's possible disciplinary action, though we have some added protection due to unionization.  




 I'll never forget a pair of JW missionaries coming to my door. I was listening to them politely until one of them mentioned JW's were the only faith to send missionaries out worldwide. I brought up the Mormons doing the same thing, and the two seemed generally confused. almost defensive about their claim. Was very weird.  




 I'm too good for this world. And too cheap. 




 I wear Axe sometimes. 




 Listening to the debate about this on Wyoming NPR, as I understand it, the bill only applies to private land, not public.  




 Yes. I spent a good amount of time being original. Every profile I come across seems so similar. The number of times I've seen "Message Me If...You want to" has killed me.  




 I don't know what I did, but thank you  









 Ah, apologies. I thought the Dems controlled Congress at one point since Reagan. Didn't know the GOP has held both houses entirely since. 




 Though the Dems have controlled the Presidency and Congress since 




 I would think people would be inclined to believe anarchists if they did more work for the better good in the public eye. As good as Food Not Bombs and print shops are, they're not enough in changing our political system. 




 Salon, Mother Jones, NYT, Jezebel and similar publications constantly post negative pieces on him.  




 State law for my school (Massachusetts) dictated that if we didn't do the pledge at least once a week, we would be fined $5 per week we didn't do it. I always thought that was a little funny.    




 It's just investment and trade deals. Chinese folks aren't flocking to Africa to move.  




 Hm, I'm only showing one on your profile. Might be an issue on my end.  




 Don't forget to pahk da cah.   




 * More pics 
* Use the word I less in your opener.  




 Have you read the Kite Runner, too? A Thousand Splendid Suns is my next read, so do you know how the two compare? 




 Good job. That was great! The buskers are my favorite part of Boston. 




 Or organize locally. Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and other states are ripe for the placement of colonies.   




 Yup, I'm a deist, though I use the Bible as a guide. 




 Did you try turning your account on and off again?

But srsly, it's not your fault. 




 BYU (Mormon college) housing. 

It's cheap. Like really cheap. No judging, mmkay? 




 Most likely not. Parody is protected free speech.  




 I miss that dirty water. 

Have fun, ya fuhking jerks.  




 What are you drinking?

Apple beer. No actual alcohol allowed in the building. 

Help.    




 Seasteading is exactly this. /r/seasteading 




 I work with vets. Best advice: learn their stories, be mindful, and don't get upset when they disagree with you. Many of these servicemen have be mishandled by the military or the government (and in the case of the US, the VA). 

To bring them to the ideas of statelessness, connect their ideas of patriotism (if they are patriots) and steer that towards a love not just of their own country, but for a love of all mankind.  




 The US government is the most well armed force on the planet. To take on such a foe would require a great amount of strength, and an even greater amount of sympathy from those within the ranks of the Feds (military, politicians, DEA, FBI, etc). Local police forces would also have to be convinced to join the site of the rebels rather than the side that funds their pensions. 

The US, being so large and diverse, would also have to find some unifying factor for rebels to be supported by a grand majority. This factor would bring together conservatives, progressives, radicals, and the apolitical alike. 

Such a rebellion would also have to be very well organized, or so popular that so many come on board the cause that taking on the US military could possibility result in victory. 

Be mindful that if we're talking civilian versus army, these means that it's guns versus tanks, fighters, war ships, and missiles.  

So, a rebellion could take place, but a successful one would be hard to come by.  









 You could try Americorps VISTA or one of their other programs.  After serving with them you become eligible for an education award (the amount depends on your length of service, which can generally go up to a year). I'm actually with Americorps myself, and after a few months of part time work I'll be eligible for a $2k education award. If I served a full year, that number would be about $5k. 

Or find a company that does tuition reimbursement.  




 Do it. Getting that degree allows you to enter not only into fields that will feed you better, but fields that are also more benefitial to your community, like non-profit work.

 I have faith in God, and follow Christ as my teacher. However, I don't need clergy for these beliefs. To me, any belief is fine, but religious hierarchy is destructive towards one's own way to God.  




 I applied for a VISTA position in Wyoming, and was one of only two people to apply. So there's that. 




 When I was living in Wyoming I made a 7 hour drive down to Denver (I think she only accepted the date because I was punny, and she didnt realize I was in a different state for some reason). It was totally worth it.

Now that I'm just near Salt Lake City, I'd say a two hour drive is my maximum. which I've done a few times.  




 I just fantasize about getting my own apartment with rabbits and cats to keep me company. One day... 




 For what it's worth, during the Civil Rights Movement there were some Return To Africa groups pushing for black Americans to go back to their ancestral land (and these were run by black Americans, such as the father of one Malcolm X). The effect of that movement was negligible.   




 Submission Comment:

According to the author, Jeb Bush has a staunch history of being an active conservative governor on things like education and the Second Amendment, yet Republicans seem to often ignore this, either due to ignorance, or his "non-conservative" stances on immigration and Common Core. The article shows how tough Bush will have it come 2016. 









 For VISTA, you will definitely become poor, and you will grow to embrace it (unless you have a killer amount of savings in your bank). My stipend was $900/mo, and rent was about $400/mo, which gave me $500 to things like food, clothing, and entertainment. Wasn't terribly hard to live by, but it was a struggle on occasion.

Also, if you're a first year VISTA like I was (NGOs can host a VISTA up to three consecutive years), you'll be breaking ground for the organization, so expect some bumps along the way.
