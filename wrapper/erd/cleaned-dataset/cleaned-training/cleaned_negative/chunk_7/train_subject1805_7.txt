 We genuinely couldn't give a fuck about losing him on a free, keeping him this year would be worth more than what you are offering 




 Critters? Sounds similar can't remember the clown but not seen it for a while 




 Fair play to him  




 Thank you for 20 RVP and for giving Fergie the perfect send off 




 What the fuck is CMV? 




 No they aren't  




 Yeh we will definitely sell for a big loss after one season 




 He can still be a professional about it instead of act like a cunt, imagine if he was a member of your staff or someone on your team. I'm a united fan so couldn't give a fuck but he's still acting like a prick 




 Jesus what a little wankstain 




 After he has picked a pug and gets asked why

"It's a bulldog innit?"

Kingsman 




 I watch other leagues and couldn't give a fuck who wins, it gives me true enjoyment as I'm a neutral who gets to watch great games but couldn't care less about specific teams 




 No because it's weird

Haha at bandwagoners downvoting me, I'm sure you support all the better teams in the different leagues because you feel a real "connection" with the teams 




 He was only 20 then in all fairness so maybe couldn't adjust that well but since then he's been all over with the national team so he might be ok now 




 Trust me mate he's painful at times because you know he can be an absolutely brilliant fucker but instead he just causes you physical pain  




 He has but he will never kick on, he will have a game where he looks like a world beater and you think fuck me what a player we have and then he will be absolutely abject for the next 6 games and you'll want him benched and then he will have a great game and then be fucking abject for 6 games etc etc time is a flat circle yadda yada 




 You are right, he is too inconsistent. It's not so much bad work ethics I genuinely just think he has a bit of a mental block when it comes to taking the next step, he always seemingly sabotages himself by doing something stupid/infuriating 




 We've no idea how well he will do 




 Yyyeeessss finally!!!!! Can't believe he is finally leaving and getting off our wage bill.

He was great in 2010-11 and one of the best in the league but fuck me he is probably the most frustrating cunt I've ever had to watch and I've had to watch a lot of them
