 Rise my child , rise to realize your true potential, unleash your power and awaking the eye of the world

 I think Nintendo made the splatoon test so they can test their servers for the launch day  




 Xenoblade x is massive, and don't forget its the first HD game for the studio so don't expect 1080p ultra  




 Floppy Wiener .. Floppy Wiener ..
