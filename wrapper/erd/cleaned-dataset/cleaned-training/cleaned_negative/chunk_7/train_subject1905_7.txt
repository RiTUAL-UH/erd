 I'm sure you could find it in BexMo. I live in Del Cerro and I'm pretty sure they carry it in KnB Wine Cellars. Are you not able to find it?

 Very sexy!

 Traffic isn't that bad. I work in Mission Valley but live just east of there and traffic isn't bad. I used to live in Little Italy and East Village and the traffic wasn't bad at all heading to work. It's nothing at all like LA or New York. 

Groceries aren't that bad and there are a LOT of small markets (shop in the Vietnamese or Mexican markets for cheap produce).

Don't forget that your utilities will drop. We don't need heat for most of the year (I think I've had it on once this winter) and you don't really need AC.  




 Something like that...lol 




 I've heard that there's this thing called a torrent and that there are places where you can download said torrents. 

But I would never do that myself. 




 Isn't this more of an ad than an actual infographic though? 




 This is really, really cool. It's probably been commented on already but it would be interesting to see this over the course of American history. 




 I don't want to live in a world where I can't drive.

 Take it for what it's worth but I've had my lever belt for four years and it's not broken.  




 It says "native". I don't get it. 




 Wow, what a cutie! 




 He's surrounded by women after being surrounded by nothing but guys. Why is he not just grinning from ear to ear?
