 Tons of books have contemporary technology in them? Or am I not understanding the question? 

Like there are both lots of stories where characters have cell phones and use computers, and there are lots of books that incorporate emails and stuff into the text.  





























 I think it's publicly available, but Melville House also published it in book form 






















































 "no one speaks in prose" as they say. 

At the same time, keep in mind that the books you are likely referring to only deal with the upper classes who, especially at that time in say England, were obsessed with seeming cultured and proper.  






















































 This is silly. You can absolutely teach students a diverse range of literature without cutting all of the old canon.  



















 such a great book! 




 Ursula K. Le Guin for sure. 

Neil Gaiman for sure. 

C.S. Lewis for sure. 

Robert Howard for sure. (Unless you are trying to make it just "high fantasy" and not all fantasy)

Gene Wolfe might be a good call too. 
 














  I'm going to back the heck off and argue that right now is a golden age for both readers AND writers. There will be more written and published this year that I want to read than I will be able to read in my lifetime. The gatekeepers are being made obsolete by sites like Smashwords, and yes, Amazon. And yes, as a consequence, right now the market is being flooded. I agree. There is definitely a lot of crap out there -- but there's also a lot of great communities that help people wade through and find some absolute gems. That's the thing -- remove the gatekeepers and the words will flow.

I think it's weird that people assume that gatekeepers are a purely bad thing. "Gatekeepers" also make sure work that gets through is professional, edited, revised, formatted correctly, etc., in addition to theoretically making sure it is good. 

I think the ideal situation is one where gatekeepers exist AND there is a way around them, but where authors still get paid decently. A world where authors don't get paid well, but everyone and their mother can publish Harry Potter fan fiction is... fine I guess, but not a great way to insure good lasting work.  



























































  Tons of plot in the series does not involve the Starks at all and nevertheless contributes to its themes,

Sure, all to be fair the books start off almost all stark. There are 72 chapters, plus a prolog for AGOT. 53 (or 74%) are Stark characters. Tyrion and Dany are the only non-Starks with POV chapters (plus the one prologue) 

ACOK adds a few Davos chapters and Theon chapters (although Theon is a Stark ward so is part of the Stark tragedy), but is still basically all Stark. Book 3 adds Jaime and Sam (the latter is part of the Jon/Stark tragedy), but is again a majority Stark chapters.

It is really only in books 4/5 that Martin starts going into the other non-Dany / non-Stark storylines. That's when we really see the non-Tyrion Lannisters, the Iron Islanders, the Donrish, and so on.  




 I mostly agree with you, but at the same time I have a hard time calling someone who sold people into slavery (Jorah) or a pillaging pirate (Asha) "good" people. Even Dany has caused tons of horror, though I guess her heart was in the right place at least.  




 sigh, not sure the semantic game you are playing. He outthinks his opponents, whether that's "cleverness" or "results driven" or "early deconstructionist knight" is kind of immaterial here.  




 As I said in my last post, Bronn is only one of the many lucks Tyrion gets so I don't want to argue too much here. All i'd say is that Bronn is only as skilled as an average knight, but he is way more clever than 95% of knights in his depiction.  




 I'm not really acting like anything, just saying Tyrion has lots of luck! look, skip past Bronn being his savior found randomly in an inn. Tyrion is saved from death by Varys for no super logical reason (Varys risks losing so much there.) He escapes despite stopping to kill his dad. He is saved from the stone men, he is saved from drowning, he survives outside of Meereen... he's constantly surviving when probably most people would die. 

It's totally cool, almost all narratives do this. I'm just disagreeing that only the bad guys have luck while only the good guys have bad luck ala the post's original argument.  




 Also 

 a single Knight we have little reason to rate as a champion fighter.

I mean, we don't get power ratings or something, but he is the captain of the Eyrie guard. He should be a pretty great knight  




 Your argument is that your average rando sellsword could have accomplished all Bronn did?  









 The book still presents him as someone near the top of warriors you'd place money on in a contest. He's not top 3 maybe, but probably top 15...whether it is "cleverness" over "pure strength" or not. That's pretty good luck for Tyrion! 




 Godly warrior, as in like the strongest around? No. But he is sold as one of the most CLEVER warriors. He defeats the Vale knight, he helps plan Blackwater, he runs the gold cloaks...he's pretty stellar all around. 

And the fact that he is just a random sellsword at the same inn that Tyrion and Cat happen to both run into each other at is totally luck. 

I'm not saying some luck is bad, just that "good" characters do get plenty of luck in the books too.  




  Amazon seems to have really wanted to reward authors of well-written, lengthy novels and stem the flow of poorly-written shorts. 

This seems smart to me. The old model really rewarded shitty, quick, short books. That's not good for anybody. 

But I agree that I don't know if this fix will solve the problem.  




 Yes agreed. Martin is flipping those Tolkien idealist fantasy stories on there head, but that doesn't mean he necessarily thinks one is 100% true or false.  




 Well we have to define what we are talking about. In Martin's world we aren't just following random people, we are following the RULING class. Kings, princes, generals. People who are born into wealth and power, or who gain it through war and conquest. 

Can you ever be a good person who gains power by war and conquest? Martin does a good job of showing how people can commit horrible acts but still be "nice guys" you'd want to have a beer with or whatever.  

But I agree it isn't necessarily intrinsic to the human race. It probably isn't even necessary in all parts of Martin's world. But it is intrinsic to a power structure like the Westerns world when you are in the ruling class.  




 I mean it's our news too. Politicians have sex scandals and shit every day. We venerate people like Steve Jobs who were famously assholish to everyone around them (Jobs even lied in court to prevent child support payments to his daughter). The NFL has players who were involved in stabbings or ran dog fighting rings. 

Basically, we venerate power not goodness.  




 The real world of 2015 or the real world of... medieval era times? 

I think it's probably pretty accurate that for most of human history rulers were horrible assholes for the most part who constantly trampled on the rights of those below them. The poor people have been shit on forever, and Machiavellian schemers DO tend to do better than idealistic good guys.  




 I like this analysis! Although I'm not sure if it is entirely accurate. 

The books (and show) have kind of bent over backwards to help out our heroes many times over. 

Take **Tyrion**. He just happens to get one of the apparently best fighters in Westeros--Bronn--on his side? Bronn is a random sellsword who is both willing and able to defeat knights in fights to the death for a stranger and a little pay. 

Plenty of luck and plot armor has been needed for **Arya** to survive, or for that matter for **Jon Snow** to survive the wildlings adventure. Arya survives being around so many enemies for so long. Snow somehow doesn't get killed by wildlings who really have no reason to trust him, then survives climbing the wall and so much 

**Dany** has luck coming out the butt at every instance, although I guess since she is magic and prophecized you can explain it. I mean there a dozens way she should have died marching with the Drogo. Skipping her magic shit, she still should have died in the red wastes, or in Qarth, or in one of her various military campaigns in Slaver's bay. 

etc.  









 Blood Meridian 




 Seems accurate for Martin's world, right? At least so far in the series, the "good" characters---Ned, Jon, Robb, Tyrion, Sansa--all are either killed or constantly undermined and abused. 

But I think the article is right that the ending of the series might be more of a "good guys win!" thing 









 I know people are probably sick of GOT articles, but I thought this one was actually very smart and made interesting points about fantasy storytelling in general 














 I think it is certainly true that much fantasy serves as escapism, especially with the white washed nostalgia for the medieval era being so common (part of the ASOIAF appeal is that it makes that era look horrible instead of super awesome knights and princesses battiling evil with happy songs) 




 ah yours didn't show up when I searched, guess cause you had social media tag stuff on the link. Sorry!  





























 Genres all overlap too though. Is Lethem's "Gun with Occasional Music" a Crime/Noir or a Science Fiction book? Is Gene Wolfe's Book of the New sun fantasy or SF? 

Anyway, contemp lit just means contemporary literary fiction. Last 40 years maybe?  




 Thought this might be inspiring to share (cross post /r/books) 









  Every other red priest DOES actually seem to be aligned with Danny. So the fact that Melissandra seems completely detached from this is odd. I do know she's classified as a shadow binder.

Not Thoros, the only other red priest in Westeros. 

This is a world where there is very little communication across kingdoms. Most of Westeros only knows vague rumors about Dany and her dragons. It's not like the red priests are calling each other on the phone discussing their crushes every night, you know?  




 ah yeah I always took it as blonde hair (ie the proof of their bastardy)  




 it doesn't say that he will die super young though, does it? Or even before Cersei?  





























 despite the headline, it doesn't seem like either person in the interview is advocating that 




 Yeah, I mean it depends on what we are talking. Small presses pay more like 1,000 to 5,000 on average. Big 5 imprints pay more like 15k average for a debut novel, from what I've seen. But often much more too.  




 I'd say the main thing to know is that ideas are a dime a dozen. It is the execution that matters. What kind of execution? Depends on what you are trying to do... write literary novels with great prose, or work that fits neatly into a specific mass market genre. Either way, your idea is only getting you 25% of the way there. The execution of the idea is the main thing.  




 I think the claim is more that the average debut book advance is $5,000. I think that's low, and it's probably more like 5 to 20K depending on the genre. Still, not a lot.  


































 Agatha Christie had a whole series with an old heroine detective, the Miss Marple novels  









 Agree with fighting the 1%, just think that would be better done against banks, wall street, tech companies, and agro-mutlinationals... not authors or even publishers (most publishers aren't really that big, and the ones that are are big for shit like cookbooks and celebrity memoirs, not quality fiction. The fiction imprints don't make that much money) 




 Sure, but those three don't single out artists in the way that the vast majority of internet commentors do. 

We live in a really weird world where people call authors greedy evil assholes for asking for a few bucks for a book they spent years writing using their 500 dollar phones and sipping their 5 dollar lattes.  




 That's an uptick from digital books after Amazon did a lot to damage profits in print books for years though. I dunno, it's impossible to pose an alternative history and figure out if Amazon's nonexistence would have helped or hurt. 

I do think that in ANY industry having one player have so much control of the market is bad. It is doubly bad if that one player isn't really invested in the production, but just in the distribution and sales. 

I'm not sure piracy is as much of a problem in books as film and TV though. Even today, the print market is much larger than the digital market. People aren't as keen on ebooks as they are on digital music/film/tv 




 Although I still root for Stannis, in the books at least, I like your AA theory. Makes sense that Melisandre would mix them up that way instead of just being 100% wrong about who is AA.  




 Well I think any of them could die before "The final fight" but I'd say the following are unkillable until at least the last half of the last book, based on the narrative weight Martin has given them: 

* Dany
* Jon Snow
* Bran
* Tyrion

Others I really don't think will die before then

* Euron (think he will be big baddy along with White Walkers) 
* Sansa (think she survives whole series, though she is certainly "killable" if Martin wanted)
* Arya

Character I hope lasts till near the end: 

* Stannis 




 You'd argue that based on what stats or inside publishing data?  




 What I never get is that people freak out about artists wanting money, but no one calls Steve Jobs or the CEO of Chipotle or the head of some toothpick brand or whatever else some "greedy capitalist arse" who we should steal from... even though I'd much rather huge corporations lose money than writers.  




 I'm sure Spotify and such help curb piracy, but they also pay complete shit. Like they are killing the music industry it seems.  




 yeah video games are much closer to like feature films... or TV shows. So many people involved.  




 the NYT is still held in very high regard too, it's the gold standard of newspapers even if papers are dying. 

Also, the fact that the NYT hosts the best seller list doesn't have much to do with their journalism or the reputation of newspapers in 2015. It's like, the Bailey's Prize for Women's Fiction is sponsored by Bailey's Irish Whiskey, the Michilen guide to restaurants is run by the tire company, etc., but even if people hated Michelin tires they'd still respect the ratings int he restaurant guide.  
































































 A bunch of these already exist. The best is Oyster. 




 Well even if this theory was true, which I don't think it is but hey it's fun, no way could they fit this into the finale. 

In King's Landing alone, we will have to deal with Cersei and Margery and their dealings with the High Sparrow. That will probably take up all our King's Landing time, since we still have Jon Snow being killed, Stannis marching and maybe attacking, Sansa/Theon/Winterfell, Dany's advisers dealing with her leaving, Arya killing Trant, and probably a scene with Dany.  




 Although really I think probably only 3-4 of those 6 will die: Jon, Trant, and either Kevan or Bronn 




 I listed Jorah, but even though he has death sentence, narratively it makes sense for him to stick around until he has infected a few people with Grayscale 




 Don't think that Balon will be shown. That will happen in season 6. Really don't think Stannis dies yet, hope not at least. Anyway: 

5) Jon Snow
4) Meryn Trant
3) Kevan Lannister
2) Bronn
1) Ramsay

HM) Jorah 




 I'd say: 

1) Arya will certainly appear, probably kill Trant and get blinded. 

2) Stannis will absolutely appear, as he was in the episode trailer. Not sure if we'll see any battle with the Boltons though. 

3) Something along those lines has to happen to finish the Winterfell arc. 

4) 50/50

5) I think this will happen, 75%

6) I think we'll see Dany land somewhere, maybe encounter the Dothraki. 

7) Yes, gotta have some Drone follow-up/reveal. 

8) Yes, 100%. Olly will stab him. 

9) Nah.  




  Eat whatever the Wildlings survive upon outside the wall. And defend the wall!

a) The Wildlings fled south precisely because they couldn't survive north of the wall anymore. 

b) Even ignoring the White Walkers killing everyone with zombie army, the Wildlings were surviving during normal summer and winter. This is the long night, the horrible winter that will potentially destroy the world. 

 Or name yourself Lord Commander after saving the NW--they couldn't deny him that.

Yes they could, and that doesn't solve the problem of not having enough food to feed an entire army for years during an impossibly long winter anyway. 

 Use all that iron bank gold to buy food from Essos.

Winter has only started and the snows are so deep Stannis cant' even march! Trading ships from Essos are not delivering food to the Wall. It's cut off.  




 Davos told him to go back, but Jon Snow made it clear that Castle Black couldn't feed and house his entire army for the winter, which likely lasts years in Westeros world.  




 Dunno, I think it would leak. I mean, honestly, bookstores get books well in advance of the release date. You can't just deliever a book to millions of bookstores the day you want it released.  




 I think Stannis, in both book and show, legitimately feels like he is both forced to be king and forced to fulfill the prophecy to save the world. I don't think he did it for himself like Walter White.  




 Littlefinger doesn't seem like the fighting type to me. He wants to sit in the shadows and see how the chaos plays out. he wouldn't risk getting killed by either side.  




 Not really how book publishing works. Takes a few months to go through editing, production, printing, and distrobution even with the quickest of turn arounds.  




  It also is very obvious that they can be pretty awful when they try to invent plots from scratch without adapting from the source material.

They are always adapting from the source, IMHO. They just combine and streamline a lot, sometimes really well and sometimes really badly. I think all their choices have been really logical, even if the writing or directing failed certain subplots.  




  But would be wrong with having those two as advisers.

Not sure i'd argue his death was good or bad, but Dany has Daario and her dumb husband as advisers, and then Tyrion comes and Jorah semi-returns. I can understand wanting to simplify things there. 

 I wish they would have stayed true to the books for that storyline. I thought the rape scene with Sansa was unnecessary and her being there is very strange for me.

Stayed true by having Ramsay rape and torture a fake Arya stark character who hadn't been set up yet? I think TV viewers who didnt' follow the books would be totally lost there.  




 Feel like this season was very mixed. the Hardhome episode might be the best of the entire series, and it was wildly different from the books. On the other hand, many of the book changes were weak and the Drone stuff in particular was really bad. Hoping that it was set-up for important Dorne stuff in season 6.  




 Left column: Stannis gives speeches about how it's totally right for single innocents to die to save thousands, and he tries to sacrifice an innocent child to the flames. 

Right column: Stannis believes the end of the world is near and he is the only hope. Melisandre told him seasons ago that he would have to betray his family to win the great war.  




 Does he even really have powers? He resurrects the one dude over and over again, but he never resurrects anyone else. I think the implication is that the Lord of Light wants him alive, not that Thoros has great powers.  




 Gotta disagree, I think the show (and books) make it very clear that blood is required for magic. Miri kills Dany's child to "save" Drogo. Dany kills Miri to waken the dragons. Stannis is half-dead after Mel creates the shadow assassins.  As for Thoros, I guess no blood is used exactly, but Beric comes back more and more a shadow of himself and LSH... well.  









  It also pisses me off that Benioff would implicate Martin; he knew full well that the episode would cause controversy (which seems to be this season's running theme and it's starting to get on my nerves

Are the showrunners really anymore gleeful about causing controversy than Martin himself (when he talked about how the Sansa sample chapter would make people freak out, etc.)?  














 Word, agree.  




 This is a semantic question. What's the line between mythology and fantasy or folk lore/fairy tales and fantasy? Is the Odyssey fantasy? Are the Grimm fairy tales? 

Personally, I'd say the real first modern fantasy is whatever prose book that used fantasy elements but WASN'T directly based on or retelling myths/fairy tales/folk legends should count as the first real fantasy work.  




  I mean, they're certainly reprehensible, but neo-Nazi is just inaccurate

Vox Day (Rabid Puppy guy) is completely a neo-Nazi, and I'm not one for hyperbole. I don't think that label fits the Sad Puppy guys at all though.  





























 ah link didn't come up, but I guess new Republic just republishes New Statesmen pieces now 






























































































 Yeah, but honestly my guess is that he will just wrote more books. I'd be surprised if we don't get at least an 8th.  




  Why do people seem to think writing a great show and sticking to source material NEED to be mutually exclusive?

I didn't say that. But you said they should have changed the plotlines they wanted to do in order to fluff up the show and make it take longer than they were planning for it to take. That doesn't make sense if your goal is the best show (according to their standards.) That only makes sense if you think staying behind martin matters the most. 

 It's at least one more year before you have to add filler. 

So now you want them to add "filler" to the show for possibly years and years until Martin finishes? If book 6 comes out in 2016, which is a big IF as far as I'm concerned, then it took Martin 5 years. It took him 6 years to do ADWD and 5 to do AFFC. So he is averaging over 5 years a book. 

So let's say he does 7 books (I think he will probably do 8 but...), that's 2021. And since the show has to be filmed and come out after that, we are talking 2022 for the show. The show is planning to end in 2017. You want them to add FIVE YEARS of filler just on the hopes of staying behind Martin? 

Honestly, your and my personal preferences aside, that's just logistically really hard. You have actors who want to do other things can't be locked into contracts that long. You have show runners who want to do other things. And you have the fact that GOT is the most expensive show ever made. Can it really sustain itself for 12 seasons? How many prestige dramas have lasted that long? Most Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, etc. type shows last half that, and they are much cheaper to make.

 1) their goal is a great show, not staying behind Martin's writing

2) what would one season help? Martin MIGHT finish book six by 2016, but it will take years for him to do book 7 (and he may well stretch to 8 or 9).  




 Plus the two books don't even cover the five years, right? Only like one year has passed 




  b) That GRRM is going to start writing the books to dovetail with what the show is doing and deviate from his own original trajectory.

I think the exact opposite, that he will change his original plan to make the books move away from show 
























 Oh, last month? The book is City on Fire by Garth Risk Hallberg (might have the name slightly misspelled). Comes out this winter I think. 

It's totally rare, but that's just an extreme example. Even if you publish a book with a small indie press that only pays you 1,000 dollars, they will send a hundred or more review copies out, get your book distributed to bookstores, set up readings, radio interviews, and the like. 

Presses do a lot of marketing work.  




 That isn't really true though. Yes, all debut writers have to do some marketing, but that doesn't mean that presses don't do a ton of it for you and do MORE of it based on how they think you will sell. I just read an article about a debut novelists who got a 2 million dollar deal and his publisher (Knopf? I think) was sending out 6,500 advance copies to reviewers. Something like that is HUGE at getting your book talked about and sold.  




  IJ isn't that great of a benchmark for long novels 

True, BUT IJ is one of the longest single book books. Like, on that wiki list you have Proust's In Search of Lost Time which was released as 7 different books over the course of many many years. 

But, yes, there are books longer by both men and women.  









 Sure, but what does that have to do with my post? I'm just saying he DOES get lit snob respect these days 




 Kind of, but I think basically every real publisher deals with Amazon (and Barnes and Noble and every other big place) because they have to to survive.  









 Here's the thing though: studies say that 1 million books are published each year. The major publishers put out thousands of titles each year. Books have been written for centuries. 

So, there are many millions of books out there. 

As such you and me and everyone else relies on a ton of filters to decide what we read. Right? And those filters--from book reviews, to marketing budgets, to "the canon" taught in school, to what your friends read--are skewed by the racism and sexism in society. 

This isn't your fault or my fault or any individual's fault, but it's how everything ends up shaking out. 

So to be clear, I'm not saying YOU are racist or sexist. I'm saying society is. And it takes a lot of work to overcome that.  




 Authors don't control that, their publishers do.  




  You read like another self hating white guy. Why the fuck would I go out of my way to "diversify" my reading log? Why would I want to read worse books just because black women wrote it?

In a world with billions of non-white people, and huge histories of fantastic literature in tons of countries all around the world, why on earth do you assume that diverse reading means "worse" books?  




 I think it's a pretty great time to be a white female author. But it's minority authors, that's a different story in America. 

Look at the bestseller lists. Almost no one on them is non-white.  




 You... never heard about slavery? Or Jim Crow? Or the statistics of wealth distribution in America?
