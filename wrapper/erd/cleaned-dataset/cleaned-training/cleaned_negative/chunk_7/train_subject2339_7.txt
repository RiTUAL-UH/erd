 How did you convert the tail?  and did that battery give you good operating time?  I have been thinking about going with something larger.  Another person mentioned the brushed motor might be inefficient do you think it would be worth getting a brushless to convert it? 




 Thanks for the suggestions,  I think if i make the ailerons big enough and with enough throw they should make a difference.  As for the motor i have thought abought replacing it, but the problem is i have no idea what to replace it with.  This is my first project, and I don't really know how to decide which motor to buy. 




 So I have an old 2 channel fighterbird from a long time ago.  

http://www.hobbyzonerc.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=HBZ4000

I am trying to convert it from a 2 channel to a 4 channel.  I think the only things that i am really going to save are the motor and the fuselage.  The electronics are just too old.  My question is what kind of esc should i use with the motor it has.  I am pretty sure it is a brushed motor.  It looks almost exactly like [this one](http://secure.hobbyzone.com/search/hcag1055.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjwqe-rBRCv_J6qs6isp6EBEiQAmbctFvBjGdlD69sZoG2TEcgYfqfWj6G93EO6dwa5Rk4JyqcaApkF8P8HAQ).

The problem is i can not find any statistics on this motor.  I would like to figure out what the amps and voltage requriements are so i can buy an appropriate ESC and battery.  

Can anyone help me out?

I feel like this could be a fun project, I just need some help figuring this out so that i can move on to the other parts of the airplane. 














 Stay tuned at /r/New_Horizons  for updates. 




 This sounds like it would do great over at /r/nottheonion  




 I am so tired of everything being about profits.  They do it to satisfy investors in the stock market, but as soon as you have a bad year or something Investors leave you behind.   




 I knew they were out there I just did not know how to get them. 




 I edit mostly in JOSM. 




 But I only visit Puebla once or twice a year.  Is there some repository for GPS traces? 




 I am mostly trying to map in Mexico.  There have been a lot of new bridges and  roads in Puebla so a lot of the old imagery is outdated. 




  Bing Aerial Imagery Analyzer

thanks for the link 




 So I remember hearing a while back about a possible deal to get the imagery updated for OSM.  I was wondering when can we expect it to be updated?  in some places it is getting as much as 4-5 years old which is a big problem because It makes mapping new features exceedingly hard.  

I am just wondering how long is the time between imagery updates typically? 




 Yea someone mentioned that it might have been slightly purposeful.  They compared the bending in LOK to boxing, which makes sense with it being a similar time period to the 1920s.  It's still boring though. 




 Bending from Avatar The Last Airbender.  That or the force from Star Wars. 




 I completely agree the animators for ALTA were much more creative in their choreography camera angles and blocking than LOK was. 




 I agree although frame by frame the quality was higher, I feel like they were much less imaginative blocking out the scenes and with their camera angles.  I also really missed the choreography of the ALTA fights.  I feel like LOK often involves the characters just using their bending to throw things at each other.  A great comparison is the [Toph, Aang, and Azula fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdcdhgn0zHM) vs the [Kuvira and Korra Fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqYY17r1UjQ).  For me the the Korra Fight is just plain boring visually compared to the ALTA.  They are standing in pretty much in the same place and just hurling things at each other.  

This is just one example there are plenty of others in Korra where they are just throwing things and ALTA ones where there is excellent choreography and it it is really fun to watch. 




 We need proof. 




 Is this really a Go Pro?  or is it just a fisheye camera?  It seems like any small camera in an extreme situation is called a Go Pro these days. 




 My question is what was Saudi Arabia's motive? 




 Basically if the pages were to prove this, it would show that the Bush administration basically cherry picked the data they wanted so that they could get public support behind attacking the countries that they wanted to.  Politically Saudi Arabia has been a relatively good ally in the region.  

The motive would be they did not want to attack a country that was an "ally" and also pretty well armed.  They preferred to focus on countries that were not friendly to the US and would be relatively easy to invade.  Like Iraq and Afghanistan.  Notice they did not invade Iran, because that country would have been able to defend it self much better, even though Iran was much more of a threat by the "Axis of Evil" standards than Iraq was. 




 How did your computer not die from the part count?

here is the conversation over at /r/space 




 It tries to prevent people from rating out agriculture companies when the people leak about bad practices going on.  

There are many ways to go about doing it, in some states they have made it illegal to lie about your intentions when getting a job.  I believe this particular one makes it possible to sue the employee for damages which is just ridiculous.  It would be like If the car companies had quality control issues and started passing laws saying they could sue an employee for lost sales if they go to the media about the quality control issues.  The only difference is this is our food which makes it even more scary. 
























 he looks a lot like [Elon Musk](http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/610-e-musk-1.jpg) 









 Why was PETA even taking the dog? 




 True if you are in the middle of nowhere but when you make an approach this close to an object it is more likely there will be other stuff. 




 This was a joke with a fun Youtube video. 




 I wonder what the surprising observations are. 














 I guess it can be slow sometimes. 









 Google cough cough  









 The two main companies are Telcel and Movistar.  I would suggest Telcel, but both should work just fine.  Telcel is like the Verison of Mexico.  Have a great time Puebla is the best!!! 




 yea i completely agree with this OSM has a huge advantage of being open source and everyones map.  plus there is no controversy 




 What you are not accounting for is the money.  If SpaceX wants to continue to develope they need a steady inflow of cash.  CRS is an amazing source of income for SpaceX which enables SpaceX to continue to develope other things like the raptor the falcone heavy and much more. 




 is there any backstory to what is happening here? 









 Less fuel, happy customers. 




 ohh that makes sense 




 PARTY!!!!!!!  They should have built this section first. Before they did the northwestern section. 




 and you can usually race them at your local yacht club.  which give you great opportunity to grow your interest. 




 yea good idea.  When i had my 3GS i updated it  and eventually it got to be a glitchy slow mess. 




 Ok thank for the heads up.

 Come to /r/New_Horizons we are posting updates all the time. 




 I wonder how many more moons they are going to find before this is over. 




 Wow great article I did not know there was a Elon musk biography coming out. 




 Do you mean the name? 




 yea i found that out from someone else I was never taught to use the flaps except on short and soft field. 




 What is a DF? 









 You are a true hero in a time of need. 



















 I think it has something to do with 2016 I lol'ed so hard. 




 This is my favorite one so far the missile launcher is the best part. 




 O my god they just keep getting better and better. 




 That cracked me up so much they are spending 1k on horse 600 an sword 7000 on girl. 




 Wow over the last day we have almost doubled the amount of subscribers to /r/New_Horizons. I want to say welcome to everyone new, I know everyone is looking forward to seeing awesome pictures of Pluto in July.

As a quick memo to everyone, updates from New Horizons have been a bit slow lately We expect them to pick up more as New Horizons gets closer to Pluto.  We will post updates, photos, ect as soon as we find them, but sometimes we can go a few days with out any new material.  If you see something interesting don't be afraid to post it. Anyway to the main point of this thread.

This is our second comment thread.  If you have questions, comments, theories, ect post it here. Hopefully we can answer anything you are wondering about. 
 




 I googled and this is the best I could find I can not spell. 




 Really I have never heard of taking off on a long runway with 10 of flaps.  I thought 10 was for short field. 




 Also they took off with the flaps down on a gigantic runway.  I wondered if they bothered to get the POH or a Checklist when they got the airplane. 




 He has [downgraded from the Jet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHi6vuikhZ0).  Also the "North Korean made Plane" looks ~~offley~~ awfully familiar I wonder if they have been exporting it ;P

Edit: My spelling IS that bad. 




 I Think the way they are doing it now works pretty well.  Wikipedia has had to be more organized with their efforts to stop vandalism mostly because they have encountered more organized vandalism like from Scientology and congress lol. 




 That tends to be pretty unusual though.  Usually the people messing with the maps are new people that just make a couple gag edits for fun and never come back. 




 I used to do map maker.  I stopped a few years ago when i started to realize more and more that I was basically giving this billion dollar corporation free labor.  

I found out about OSM when I was looking for maps for my GPS and came across http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/ great site and I made a profile and started contributing to OSM after that. 




 All those things are exactly what Google Map Maker had in place.  It's not impossible to solve but it would be difficult.  I feel like wikipedia has shown that it can be done though and I feel like OSM should use similar techniques to Wikipedia to solve the problem of vandalism if it starts to become a problem.  

I also feel like one thing that has protected OSM for a while is actually how the learning curve is steep.  Especially for JOSM.  Having multiple editing tools makes it a lot easier to stop vandalism in my opinion.  The ID editor is the easiest to use and would probably attract the most trolls.  If you needed to you could put more restrictions on the easier editors or something like that. 




 It used to be a i did not have to worry about when something said (spoilers all) because the books were well ahead of the series. But i am starting to be afraid when it says (spoilers all) i should watch out that the series does not spoil something for me. 




 It's all about demographics  California is having issues with antivaxers in some of its most affluent neighborhoods. 




 ohh god you got to love the news 




 I was in elementary school and I just remember thinking about how long it would be till 2015. 




 Yea I feel like the only thing that keeps OSM from experiencing this problem is the small size of the community.  If OSM were to get as popular as google maps you would start running into a lot of the same problems. 




 I feel like the only problem with this picture is the ages are way off.  Toph is still book 2 size meanwhile Sokka Looks like he is in his 20s 




 Can you be more specific? 




 I think i enjoyed the later seasons more because Korra matured and stopped acting like a jerk.  I don't like watching shows with characters who are disrespectful and act like jerks most of all when they do it to the people who are most important to them.  There is a difference between being strong willed, and being disrespectful, and Korra was disrespectful up until she went back to Tenszin in season 2.  I remember one episode that stuck out for me from ATLA was first episode of Book 3 when Aang made a point to be nice to Katara's dad even though Katara was obviously unhappy with her dad.  That made him so much more mature in my eyes than if he had just sat there. 




 I am that guy. I wish we would have gotten to travel and see more of the world like we did in ATLA.  Avatar is about saving the world, not just Republic City. 









 you should come check out /r/New_Horizons we are posting updates about the mission. 




 Yea but this is under a very controlled circumstance.  Aborts don't happen when everything is going right.  also the reason it didn't start tumbling was because of the trunk.  In general you want something to be passively controlled in circumstances where you might not be able to be confident in your data or your systems.  People forget that lifting the trunk is not that big of a deal.  The Soyuz lifts a fairing and the habitation module as well as the decent module during its aborts. 




 I just realized is that Azula bending fire?  It seems to me that the intro is [Pakku](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Pakku) bending water, [The Boulder](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/The_Boulder) earth bending, [Azula](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Azula) fire bending with orange fire instead of blue, and possibly an older version of [Aang](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Aang) air bending?  The air bender seems the most ambiguous. 




 I thought you were asking a question.  




 maybe but I think you need more extreme height differences for it to really be a factor. 




 There is only tallest mountain in the world, and we are sort of turning it into a trash heap with a crazy amount of tourists. 




 I think the problem with raising the price is you just further make it into a rich persons vacation.  Ideally you want real mountain climbers climbing the mountain not rich people looking for a cool vacation.

I would be up for closing it completely or really limiting it, but if you do that China and Napal have to work together.  Because if you only close the Nepal side people will just climb from the China side. 




 It's not really a surgery, it takes seconds.  It doesn't grant you magical STD protection it just gives you a slightly lower likelihood which doesn't really matter in places with relatively low STDs.  And it doesent really matter on the individual level, but can make a big difference for the population overall in places in Africa where 15% to 50% of the population has HIV/AIDS 




 Only one guy has only done it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Delsalle 




 Not to mention that you would only be able to carry one or two bodies down at a time.  It would also be really expensive.  You would have to pay millions to for the helicopter as well as pay some people a lot of money due to how dangerous it is.  As of now there is no one willing to pay that cost. 




 I am guessing the percentage of oxygen in the air is about the same, but at a higher altitude there is less air.  So you take a breath and less molecules are going into your lungs. 




 Yea I feel conflicted about how its like a rich person adventure now.  It's kind of sad how the mountain is just getting covered in trash and dead bodies. 




 I listen to music while I am driving, but driving does not include radio calls, marking checkpoints, and so on.

 It is crazy to hear the stories about guys skin coming off their legs like socks.  It's horrible and amazing at the same time. 




 As I said I am not advocating for circumcision.  I am not saying everyone should be circumcised.  I am just pointing out reasons why it is less controversial and generally not considered to be on the same level as FGM by the medical community and the general public. 



















 I do agree that it is morally questionable how circumcision is usually done to infants. 




 It tends to fall into 3 major categories.  Almost all of the time it involves removing the clitoris and then depending on the type they may remove other parts.  The less extreme forms would be comparable to cutting off the end of the penis. the most extreme forms would be comparable to removing the whole penis.  Either way circumcision does not affect the mans quality of life in any way close to the way FGM affects a woman.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation#WHO_Types_I.E2.80.93III 




 http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/  There are a lot of reputable sources saying it does. 




 Circumcision is less controversial though, is generally not detrimental to the mans well being/sexual health and arguably has health benefits like reducing the transmission of HIV/AIDS as well as some other STDs.  FGM is more like cutting off the whole or part of the penis.

Edit: I didn't realize stating facts would be so unpopular.  here is a link talking about how HIV transmission is reduced with circumcised heterosexual males.  http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/

Edit2: Everyone calm down, I am not saying I support circumcision.

Edit3: Defined well being.

Edit4: /u/blank_sunday_stares posted a good link showing no correlation between circumcision and STDs http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19115756 I thought I should put it in my post.  I did say that it was arguable wether it reduces HIV/AIDS transmission.  As always more science could help. 




 I have been seeing in a lot of posts recently showing people listening to music while they are flying.  I want to know peoples opinions on it.  

Personally I don't think I would listen to music while I am flying.  I feel like it would be a distraction and possibly make me miss radio calls from ATC if I have flight following or something.  But I want to see what other people think.  Do you listen to music while you are flying?

Also what is the legality of it?  What are the restrictions and so on? 




 I think the advantage would be you would have a means of transportation once you got to your destination.  That still omits the fact it would be ridiculously expensive. 




 i think you underestimate the depth of rich peoples pockets i think if he could sell 50 of these he would be successful and i would be tempted to say that there are 50 people in the world that would buy this. 




 I think the best way to do a movie would be to make a completely different story line from the books maybe something after the events of the tv show.   









 There have not been any updates on New Horizons in the last few days.  There have also been no new pictures in the last few days either but rest assured that we will post them as soon as they come out.  It takes a while for pictures to be uploaded by Nasa.  Many times new pictures were actually take weeks prior.  Even when New Horizons passes Pluto you should not expect to start getting the bulk of the pictures until at least a week after. 




 If it makes you feel better I am a 90's kid. 




 I am amazed how easy it was for her to turn that nob I would have thought the o rings would have created more friction than that.  Are the o rings lubricated? 




 lol i didn't even realize that was your post.  Thanks for that by the way i can fly my rockets now without feeling like i am flying through honey. 




 It was I personally think that 1.0.2 with these small physics edits is the best of both worlds. 




  machConvectionEnd = 3.5
 newtonianConvectionFactorBase = 1
 newtonianConvectionFactorTotal = 1

What do these factors do? I have not edited them and i am a little afraid to do so because they were not in the original aero edit post.

 Change the physics values back to 1.0 its so much better.

 I grew up in the south in the 2000s American Exceptionalism is proud and strong in the south.  You here it all the time about how the US is the Freest country in the world, best at this, best at that.  Most of the time these people have never left the country. 




 I made a gigantic fuel station out of orange tanks back in .20 it lagged so much.  Docking would take 10 minutes.  I didn't even realize how bad it was until I docked two normal Kerbal pods together it was so fast took like 2 minutes. I was like man that was easy what have i been doing? 




 My computer is lagging just loading that photo. 




 Yea i just found that video. 




 Do you have a link to that?  I didn't know about the Book 3 DVD extras 




 Does anyone have a mirror?
