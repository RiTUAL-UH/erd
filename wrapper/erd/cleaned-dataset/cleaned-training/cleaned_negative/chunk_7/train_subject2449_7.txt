 Well I'm in the UK, so it's a bit different here, all of the people in my year/grade (year 10) have to take all the sciences, maths  religious studies etc and I take an exam at the end of next year which is our 1st important exams we do here. Thanks for the nice comment :) I appreciate it :) 




 Thanks :)
