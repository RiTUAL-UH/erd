 Buzzkill.  The second skit where they pretended to be a spring break shuttle for college students, then pulled over and pretended to rob a store.  This was before the CKY videos and Jackass, the third skit where they pranked MTV really made the show cutting edge. 




 Magneto and Professor X - X-Man First Class.  Paul Rudd and Jason Segel - I Love You Man.  River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton - Stand By Me  




 I can't find The Howard Stern E! show with it, but Artie Lange's Pig Story is simply amazing.  "That's a pig doing cocaine!"      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD6pYH0-GbQ 




 Are You Afraid of the Dark, specifically the clown episode where the kid steals the cigar from the funhouse clown.  Fuck clowns, fuck em.
 




 Ocarina of Time (Water Level and all)  




 X-Men 2 with Nightcrawler is pretty damn good.
