  When did I say those breeds shouldn't be handled the same way?

/u/lol_wat94 asked the question: "why are we spending all this time ganging up on one?" You replied that "those 20 other breeds rarely, rarely, rarely do when compared to this one breed." The implication of your answer is that it's reasonable to gang up on pit bulls and not gang up on the 20 other breeds, i.e., that those 20 other breeds shouldn't be handled the same way as pit bulls. If that wasn't the intent of your answer, then please clarify how you feel the 20 other breeds should   shouldn't be handled the same way as pit bulls.

 But obviously, they are not the biggest problem.

How so? The data in the [Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf) suggest otherwise.

  How is that not a problem?

When did I say it wasn't a problem? /u/lol_wut94 asked the question: "why are we spending all this time ganging up on one" when there might several other breeds (perhaps 20) that are equally or more dangerous? So far you've evaded the question rather than answering it. So if you   I agree that pit bulls are dangerous (/u/lol_wut94 might disagree), then what's your answer to their question: why do you seem to be only focusing on pit bulls? 




 While it is true that pit bulls account for the majority of dog bite-related fatalities (DBRF), that does not in itself demonstrate that they're more dangerous than the 20 other breeds mentioned by /u/lol_wut94. That's because in [risk assessment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment), relative dangerousness is objectively measured not by fatality *numbers* but instead by fatality *rates*. Here's how it's described by the CDC in their [report on DBRF](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf):

 Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the **relative dangerousness of each breed**. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.

When relative dangerousness is calculated in this manner, then fatalities by those 20 other breeds are not so rare when compared to pit bulls. Feel free to run the numbers yourself based on the most recent [Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf).

 [According to the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf), there are approximately 800,000 dog bites per year that require medical attention. [According to the CVMA](http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.colovma.org/resource/resmgr/CLSD_Data_Presentation_Sept2.pdf), pit bulls account for 9.35% of dog bites (as opposed to fatalities), so about 75,000. [According to Merritt Clifton](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf), pit bulls make up 6.7% of the dog population, so about 5.5 million.

800,000 dogs attack per year out of a population of 83.3 million (1.0%). 75,000 pit bulls attack per year out of a population of 5.5 million (1.4%), which means that 98.6% of pit bulls don't harm anybody. Your sources are well   good but they only show that the 1.4% of pit bulls that attack are more dangerous than the 1.0% of other breeds that attack. However, your sources don't disprove /u/Schneiderman's claim that "the majority of pit bulls do not harm anybody." 




  Even if you take the pitbull stats and cut them in half- they are still by far the most dangerous breed

You make a valid point but seem to forget that this is not statistically how relative dangerousness is calculated in risk assessment. Here's how it's explained by the CDC in their [2000 report](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf) concerning dog bite-related fatalities:

 Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.

When fatality *rates* are considered in a more statistically rigorous manner than simple fatality *numbers*, it could be argued that other breeds might be more dangerous than pit bulls (which just so happens to be the conclusion of the 2000 CDC report). 




  Total bite-related fatalities between 1979 and 1998:

I think that you mean *total dogs involved in bite-related fatalities* between 1979 and 1998. That is, it looks like you added up the 6th column in Table 2, which are the numbers of dogs, as opposed to the 3rd column in Table 2, which are the numbers of fatalities. They're not the same because sometimes multiple dogs were involved in the same fatality.

Here are the other numbers for comparison:

* Grand total (fatalities): 238
* Non-pit bull: 162
* Pit bull: 76

Top 5 as a percent of total:

1. Pit bull: 32%
2. Rottweiler: 18%
3. German Shepherd: 11%
4. Husky: 9%
5. Malamute: 6%

As an added bonus, here's how the top 5 stack up when comparing fatality rate, i.e., % fatalities divided by % population, as described in the first paragraph of the Discussion section of the CDC report:

1. Malamute: 6%  0.08% = 75.0
2. Husky: 9%  1.0% = 9.0
3. Rottweiler: 18%  2.8% = 6.4
4. Pit bull: 32%  6.7% = 4.8
5. German Shepherd: 11%  3.7% = 3.0

  What do we lose by banning dangerous breeds?

Keep in mind that the councilmen have suggested banning only pit bulls and not all dangerous breeds. It's possible that the problem is a combination of potential for injury and breed popularity, since pit bulls are the 2nd most common breed after only Labs. And according to a CDC report from 2000, Rottweilers were responsible for more injuries 20 years ago when pit bulls were less common. So, banning only pit bulls might not solve the problem if owners simply adopt other dangerous breeds instead.

  I'm not the one singling them out, they're doing that themselves.

How so? According to the [Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf), the fatality rates for Akitas, German Shepherds, Huskies and Chows are likewise disproportionate. Citing the Wikipedia page on fatal dog attacks certainly indicates that fatalities from pit bulls are disproportionate to the breed's population but it doesn't disprove /u/nomecks's point that there are other breeds with a similar issue.

  The risk to humans during encounters with pit bulls far out-weigh their prevalence as a dog breed.  Thoughts?

The same can be said of wolf-like breeds (including German Shepherds   Huskies) and Chow-like breeds. According to your source, the fatality rate (fatality % divided by population %) is 9-to-1 for pit bull-type dogs, but it's equally disproportionate for wolf-like dogs (4-to-1) and Chow-like dogs (20-to-1). I would propose that your interesting   reasonable options should be considered for all three breed groups and not just pit bulls. Otherwise, if those options are only considered for pit bulls, then the data suggest that other potentially dangerous breed groups are being unreasonably excluded.
