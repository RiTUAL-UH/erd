 Ahhhh.... I get it, that was a great twist at the end. Honestly I didn't see that coming, awesome! 




 Oh my, I have to admit, that was pretty good. 




 I love it, I didn't expect that twist and if certainly wasn't predictable like the other stories I've read. 




 Well I hope you the best on your plan. 




 I don't get it. 




 That was strangely sweet and sad at the same time. 




 Why don't you just hit the save button, so you can check on the story later? 




 Well.... yeah, I'm not doing that. But I am interested in hearing the rest of your story. 




 I'm pretty sure the artist didn't mind.

 It's okay the cops probably won't come before you get murdered, but at least locked the doors. And maybe if you got a knife to defend yourself, you might be able to hold off long enough for the cops to arrive in time to see you stab her. But hey, I'm just trying to be positive here, there are so many other things that could happen.... 




 Umm..... you said titties instead of titles. 




 Probably not if she didn't know why she was in the living room. 




 With our deep dark desires of course.
