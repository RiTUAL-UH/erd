 yeah 14.04, think I'll give 15.04 a shot, I was actually going to get 15.04 at first, but ironically chosen 14.04 so I could avoid the bugs...  




 But I don't like the NSA and all the third party anti privacy backdoor stuff that comes with it :( 




 Computer is all new. I've got to reinstall the whole thing now, simply because I can't login or open terminal, which means getting the ethernet cable out and going through all that pain again. All I wanted to do was install Ubuntu. I'll try again probably tomorrow... thanks for the tip! :P 




 I've ran it in a Virtualbox with no problems. 

But dual booting it, it seemed to want to throw everything that could possibly go wrong at me.

Totally broken the OS now, like straight up broke it. Can't login, can't open terminal cos it goes black when I do. Fml. 




 The usb wasn't bad, it was another usb (LEDS.... some freakin lights....) that was causing the issue. Ubuntu thought the CPU had died...

Nvidia GTX 980, went onto the additional drivers menu, chose one of them (xorg), broke everything, selected another (532), partly works but buggy as hell. 




 A nightmare.

* - Spent 2 hours figuring out why it wouldn't boot the installer, it was caused by another usb.
* - Spent another 2 hours trying to connect to the internet, I used an ethernet cable in the end to get the drivers needed for the adapter to work (WHY THE FUCK WEREN'T THEY FUCKIN INCLUDED IN INSTALLATION?!?! WTF GOOD LOGIC.)
* - The wifi adapter kept going on and off, I fixed it finally though, somehow after half a day.
* - Spent over 3 hours trying to get the freakin video drivers to work, I'm running on a GTX 980.
* - Installed video drivers, buggy as fuck. Tried fixing the bugginess, broke the operating system.
* - There is no logical method of finding out what video drivers you need.
* - Couldn't login, would go black and return to the login screen. Opened the terminal and fix it that way.
* - Ran some updates. Broke it again.
* - Tried to login again, same thing as before.
* - Me being super wise thought I'd just put the backup I made in earlier. There's no option to do so via recovery.
* - Thought I'd repair broken packages in recovery, did literally nothing. Like enter ubuntu is now afk
* - Currently uninstalling this disease.


And they call this Linux with learning wheels?

Rating: 2/10. Very shiny. Requires a degree in space rocket launch sequences to get it simply in a running state. (And this is all using fairly popular hardware...)

Going to go cry in a corner now.

Edit: Installed 15.04 instead of 14.04. Installed flawlessly. Maybe there's hope? :O 




 ***EVERYTHING!!!***
