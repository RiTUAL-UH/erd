 Anyone else really pissed Jade didn't get a rose? I feel like she was the only one who would actually live in Iowa with Chris. I don't see Whitney moving, Kaitlyn isn't ready for marriage, and Becca just doesn't have the chemistry/is too 1-dimensional.  




 I think people that commit suicide are completely pathetic. You should be able to help yourself before you get to that point.  




 Anyone here on r/aves also going to this show? I've read other threads on how Armin's live sets are amazing, and echostage has gotten good reviews on this sub. Anyone have any tips for tonight (this will be my 5th rave).
