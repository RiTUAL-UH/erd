 I use vim for everything. 




 awesome, yeah i didn't hear back from you as to whether or not you had success. 




 hey g33kdad, I talked to you on #jupiterbroadcasting yesterday, did you end up getting the touchpad working on your i3? 




 In this world gone mad, you don't fuck the Hulu, the Hulu fucks you. 




 Hulu Plus works in linux natively...fuck Netflix. 




 Congrats to you, I'm approximately 36 hours from hitting my 1 solid year smoke and nicotine free myself.  Smoking is ass. 




 Trust me, there were a lot of false starts before I actually quit.  I mean my new years resolution for 2011 was to quit smoking, it only lasted a few days, but it started a series of quits that led to this year long one.
