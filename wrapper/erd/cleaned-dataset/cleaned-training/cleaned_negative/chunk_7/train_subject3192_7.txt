 Entourage 




 My friends and I went to go see that Wayans brothers movie "A Haunted House," which is obviously a African American humor movie. It was fuckin god awful. We were about 6 rows back from the screen right in the middle. Literally the only white guys there. We wanted to leave so bad, but everyone else was loving every bit of it. We didn't want to offend or disturb anyone and with that being sad witnessed the shittiest film I've seen in awhile.
