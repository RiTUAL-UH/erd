 Nah yo. Old bay isn't that chunky.

 I'm just gunna leave this here. http://www.pappascrabcakes.com/Main/index.asp 




 We have a restaurant in my area that has the best crab cakes and I'm pretty sure they will ship them anywhere. Place called Pappas.  




 Most of the world will never know how awesome a Maryland style crab cookout is. It's a damn shame.
