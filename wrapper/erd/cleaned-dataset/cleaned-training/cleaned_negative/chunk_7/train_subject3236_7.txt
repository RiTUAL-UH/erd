 Your welcome, and sorry for the mess.. 




 nope, I believe that we all have the right to love anyone we want and get married with anyone we want, I don't critisize people for who they love, I just don't like the idea. Freedom is for everyone and that's my opinion. Sorry but please don't continue the argument, we have opposite opinions and that's not a reason to ruin this gentlemans request. 




 I learned something from this picture, that's why I mentioned it. Please read carefully before commenting, people tend to get aggressive in these topics. 




 and that's exactly why I believe in freedom of speech! You did very good job there, looks great! 




 thanks
