 It's a fighting game.. the online is the same as the single player / couch VS.

All they need to mention about the online is how stable it is, that's it. 




 They may as well have made them an on screen prompt

 It might have been a spell yeah, havent played it since it came out.

Edit: Just checked and yeah, it's Aura. 




 What was that item that gives you instant limit breaks?  I remember farming an area for them till I had 99 and the rest of the game  became way too easy... 




 Those are Jandles... 




 Heh, TIL. Thanks man.

 Rocky.

Every single time I watch Rocky I get the urge to get up and move, to do something... 

But as OP mentioned that motivation is short lived... And usually wasted on doing something like doing my laundry or going to the store. You know, feats hardly worthy of montage. 




 Paaphenalia? 




 I wish, not sure who did sorry. 




 [Perhaps this will help explain things](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/w5MHii8 ) 




 Netscape Navigator? 




 Agreed, she has some decent plot that is yet to be revealed. 




 Really? Hahah damn, guess I'll soon be raging along with ya. 




 I didnt start doing the Chalice Dungeons till late game when I was lvl90+... They've been a walk in the park so far. 




 Isn't that how animation works though,  there's always a few key frames of exaggerated features or movement so we the viewer fill in the blanks rather than drawing the full 24 frames to achieve fluid animation?

 I'm level 59 and lost 75k odd last night, didnt even care. I can beat the enemies in the area easily and more than likely the upcoming bosses at my current level.

You get to a point where collecting echos becomes secondary, it's all about advancing. 

When you hit a wall and feel you cant advance then yeah, you start to farm again. 




 Thats my strategy as well, works perfectly. 




 Nope, this is how I've handled him every time I fought him, even when helping other players. 

Keep your distance but not too far away or he'll do his frenzy attacks, just close enough and he'll do that one swipe which you can avoid easily.

At the end he goes crazy and I get tagged a few times before I get back into the rhythm of the attacks. 




 All enemies / bosses have a tell... Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ajzTudyWg) and see if it helps 




 Possible spoilers:

Took him down in about 3 mins without getting hit till the end of the battle, I choked once I needed to use items...

 [Same thing happened to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ajzTudyWg) 




 [Its my characters time to shine]( http://imgur.com/wq3H7QO ) 




 Heh, this morning I posted saying you can farm him for these and got downvoted.

And here we are with a vid to back it up. Thanks man.

 I'm not saying that all, what I'm saying is this a gameplay mechanic in almost every single rpg ever made.

Run out of an item? 

YOU NEED TO EITHER FARM FOR IT OR USE YOUR CURRENCY TO PURCHASE IT.

If you dont like that then tough shit. 




 And a group of woman is called a "Gossip" 




 When you get more than 20 of the health items or bullets they go into storage.

So If you run out and die, rather than farming go back to the hunters dream and restock.

If you run out of both... Then yeah, you have to farm or purchase them. That's a simple gameplay mechanic present in most if not all games. Or do you expect games to just hand you what you need so you dont need to actually play the game?

 [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sxCinAZrqU) 




 Well I got the "Blood Gem Master" trophy from farming him... 

Edit: I meant "Blood Gem Contact" trophy, my bad.
Heres my [trophies](http://psnprofiles.com/trophies/3431-Bloodborne/DukeDuG) for the game, I'm still at the start and only just beat the Cleric Beast. After that I was farming and found I could get easy gems from [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sxCinAZrqU) 




 I've been getting them from that big guy with the cleaver at the very start of the game. Every other kill he'll give me a variant of them.

Not sure if I'm lucky or if people killed him once then ignored him after that.  




 If you have unlocked the slide kick... use that as it breaks their leg and kills them in one hit.

It's stupid but I guess in a zombie apocalypse a broken leg is a death sentence. 




 Did Garrett leave any money or pay for his share of the rent and bills before leaving?

If not... Classic Garrett.

 Every time I meet a voice actor or someone famous with a distinctive voice I get them to say "Purple monkey dishwasher". 

Best one was the dude who voiced Goku, got him to yell it out like he was powering up a kamehameha, then again as King Kai.

Though not once have I have I recorded them saying it... 




 I'm aware and fine with that, when the game is released. 

Not in alpha, especially after already paying an access fee to test their game.

 




 I have brought great shame upon my family... 




 Wait.. isnt the final game going to be free?


Why are people paying to play an alpha / to be a tester... as well as pay a monthly sub fee to do so.

Remember the days when companies paid people to test their games, when games came out as final products and DLC / expansions where an after thought and not part of the games build / business strategy... 

 




 Some of these are awesome, especially [this one.](http://i.imgur.com/zMQMX.jpg) It looks like an alternate universe or another planet for some reason. 

While some other pics... Damn man... the reality of that war...

I recommend you xpost these to /r/estoration and /r/colorizationrequests, you'll be able to get a few of these fixed up.

 PlayStation Gold Wireless Stereo Headset

You can pick them, up for about $99 these days, if not cheaper.

They're confortable, the sound quality is decent, battery lasts a few days on one charge, they support different sound profiles / uses the PS4 app to change equalizer settings, and well... they're wireless which is always a plus.

Now, figure out if I'm serious or not. 




 No they are not, I have lost two accounts so far.

The first one I had since PSN first launched, I spent months fighting with Sony to recover it after it was hacked... I had over $2000 worth of digital content on that account, games for PS3, PSP, Vita, and PS4... Sony said they could not verify any of my information. I guess as it had been changed, the name, address and email had been changed more than 3 times... Apparently their system doesnt keep record of the original information if it is changed enough times. So too them I never owned the account, all the receipts of purchases were useless, all the information I could provide was moot, there was no way I could prove it was my account.

The second time it happened, within the same year I might add... I didnt even bother trying to recover it.

I have since cut back majorly on using PSN to purchase digital content, and if it werent for all my firends being Sony/PS4 users I would have switched over to XBOX or PC.

 Congratulations on your success, use it to buy more Nutella? 




 Yeah I know how and why the US/AU price difference works, and I'm generally ok with it.

But this... this is obscene, collector editions etc are usually around the $129AU mark, which is still high but whatever.
I really hope no one purchased this edition off PSN... 




 What the fuck, who in their right mind would pay close to $200 for a game, a digital copy at that... Not sure what the price is anywhere else but I'm sure it's still going to be way too high.

I just dont get gaming anymore...  




 He probably thought Nutella was a health food and joined a class action lawsuit after he found out it's not really all that good for you.

Meaning he is either retarded or he jumped on the bandwagon to be part of the lawsuit in hopes of getting some money.

Just a guess. 




 Heh, I stand corrected. I just did a search and yeah, it is [rather big...](http://attackofthefanboy.com/news/final-fantasy-type-0-hd-ps4-larger-file-size-xbox-one/)

As others have mentioned, some PS4 games will download a part of the game, the intro, sometimes a prologue section that you can watch or play while the rest of the game downloads. 

That seems to be the case here. 




 Well yeah, it's an up-scaled PSP game... Dont see how it would exceed 4GB regardless of the changes. 




 So what you're really saying is that at Christmas, if you're bad and a goy you'll get coal... But If you're Jewish, then you get gold?

So that is why Jewish people dont celebrate Christmas, to be on Santas naughty list and ensure a delivery of gold... Very crafty Jews, very crafty indeed.

 "Hey guy, buy our incomplete game at full price. We'll patch in the missing content at a later date, you know, the stuff that we promised would be available at launch. The stuff we even delayed the release for... But dont worry, the game looks good, shiny like.

Feel like the base game content is a bit barebone, a bit sparse? Dont worry, we've got all this other content coming out for you... Which you can pay for, as single dlc packs or as a (*snickers quietly*) season pass.

Whats that, is this an early access title? No, it's a AAA game (*chortles audibly this time*) so dont worry, we'll have all the content and bugs fixed by the end of the games life cycle... But thanks for your $56.95 + $27.95, we may choose to provide this content for free to other users who purchase this game once it's complete.

Thank you early adopter and race on!"
