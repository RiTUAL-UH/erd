 It's absolutely incredible out here. We're on a big road trip, and we found ourselves adding a lot of days here just to take in all the sights and trails. We leave for Breckinridge tomorrow.

Hit a patch of gravel at just the wrong time in the middle of a switchback. Bailed just in time to see my fairly new 800 gs slide across the gravel and off a cliff. I walked away, the bike made it out okay with some nice battle scars, so not too bad. I was back on the trails in two days
