 Help I'm having a test tomorrow and I'm certain this question will come up.



A square has four points ABCD

D is missing, C has two missing coordinates. 


A=(-3|-6|-3)

B=(1|-4|1)

C=(c1|-8|c3)

I can use the dot product and the fact that ABAD=0 also AB AD are equal in length. 




 De nada 




 I wonder if, if you calculate the angle you'll find a huge bow  




 Only problem...she never calls :( 




 I duplicated the skin's folder


Right-click on that skin while loaded
Where there is a string of 
Option=...
Value=...


Enter

Option=Flip
Value=1
