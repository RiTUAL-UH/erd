 Maybe I just suck but it was a 6 star Naz that was spamming his passive like crazy. First it goes wolf then it's passive. Or it was a 5 




 Do you think toast would do something about that? Most of my losses come from this :( 




 I've tried anut and it seem to work or I just killed naz fast enough. 




 He keeps spamming his passive every second, is this bugged? If I don't get the right blocks or kill him fast enough my team just gets knocked up every second and just melt. 




 Oooo thanks, I just randomly use all my bread  









 Doing bread dungeon, boss at like 100 health or so, accidentally hit two three chains in a row......... instadeath everywhere. EoG and RNG why... (Was doing the 2-chain one) 




 I think if you take the gift at max you don't get any?  




 I had full meat when I started, got free 30 meat in the mail. I'm expecting it to just go over but nope, meat didn't change. Is this the new feature?
