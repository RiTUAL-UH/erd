[FB Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1463670323866314/)

Join Tipsy Oxcart for a night of funky Mediterranean madness at Radio Bean. All the way from Brooklyn, Tipsy Oxcart plays electric, sweaty, bumpin' Balkan music, channeling the spirit of 36 hour weddings to keep the crowds dancing until the sun comes up. Serving up originals and fresh, upbeat arrangements of urban dance tunes, the band deviously infuses the sounds of South-Eastern Europe with elements of jazz, funk, and more. Dig naughty violin solos, atomic accordion grooves, freak-me-out clarinet, and the baddest rhythm section this side of the Mediterranean. A party with Tipsy Oxcart is guaranteed to shake the dance floor all night long!
