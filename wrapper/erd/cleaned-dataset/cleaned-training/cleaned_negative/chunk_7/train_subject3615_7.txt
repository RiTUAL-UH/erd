 quite a bit can be found in Mark Mazzetti's [**The WAY of the Knife**](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/2hi86o/the_way_of_the_knife_the_cia_a_secret_army_and/)--check the index in back for Pakistan.

There's a documentary called [**CORE OF CORRUPTION**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhdReD6MAo) which has the Bob Graham and the newspaper from India publishing the article linking Pakistan's ISI to funding. (The doc has great information...but the music is a little annoying)

**STRANGE** that the CIA spent untold amounts on operations as well as untold amounts of cash bribing everyone they could in Afghanistan and Pakistan to find out where UBL was...then they finally get lucky--after spending BILLIONS--and have an informer  WALK-IN who worked for the Pakistani ISI come in and cough up UBL's location. 

**STRANGE** that the U.S. gave Military Aid to Pakistan from 2002-2011--up to $3 Billion per year ($30 Billion total). 

**STRANGE** that Porter Goss, John Kerry and Bob Graham were with the head of the Pakistan's ISI on 9/11 in Washington DC

**STRANGE** that the head of Pakistan's ISI quit about a week after 9/11 because a newspaper from India published an article outing him as having sent the 9/11 hijackers money

...but most folks don't remember all that.

 Finally started reading Part 1--Kinzer really knows how to shine light on all the important little details without getting bogged down--can't wait to pick up a hard copy of this book so i can make notes and underline with my red pen...

In addition, former CIA Director Porter Goss has registered to lobby for Turkey--guess he'll be lobbying for funds, weapons and training.

(quotes from book)----------

Cover photograph by Dennis Rolfe shows a typewriter and bugged case planted on the author presumably by the CIA.

---------------

(forward by Patrick Breslin) After a stint as an Air Force officer (for cover) and CIA training, Agee arrived in Quito, Ecuador in late 1960. During the glory years of the Alliance for Progress and the New Frontier, he fought the holy war against communism by bribing politicians and journalists, forging documents, tapping telephones, and reading other people's mail.

But it was a faraway event which seems to have disturbed him more. Lyndon Johnson's invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965 was an overreaction Agee couldn't accept. In 1968, he resigned with the conviction that he had become a "servant of the capitalism I rejected" as a university student"one of its secret policemen."

--------

(begin Philip Agee) When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book.

--------------

Even after recent revelations about the CIA it is still difficult for people to understand what a huge and sinister organization the CIA is. It is the biggest and most powerful secret service that has ever existed. I don't know how big the KGB is inside the Soviet Union, but its international operation is small compared with the CIA's. The CIA has 16,500 employees and an annual budget of $750,000,000. That does not include its mercenary armies or its commercial subsidiaries. Add them all together, the agency employs or subsidizes hundreds of thousands of people and spends billions every year. Its official budget is secret; it's concealed in those of other Federal agencies. Nobody tells the Congress what the CIA spends. By Law, the CIA is not accountable to Congress.

----------------

I grabbed a sandwich at a blind stand and then took the shuttle to the Executive Office Building. (Those blind standssandwich bars operated by blind peopleare in practically every building. I guess it's a good thing for the blind people to have that work, and the company can let them in the buildings because they can't read secret papers. Everybody wins.)

------------------

The interrogator announced that I had reached the final phase of the security clearance procedure necessary for access to Top Secret material and, of course, for employment with the company. He assured me that all employees of the company, even Mr. Dulles, submit to the polygraphnot just once when they're hired, but periodically throughout their careers.

 DoD: "I know we can't account for [$8.5 TRILLION](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget)--but *TRUST* us on this one!!! 




 Synchronicity is always good. Do you remember when Bush-Cheney first got into office and Cheney was being so secretive about the Energy Commission? After a year or two a few pages of what they were working on finally came out thru a FOIA lawsuit--one of the only pages which was released was an analysis of Iraq's oil/gas fields. 

Another thing that I think may have happened is the U.S. most likely had Iraq sign up to supply U.S. forces with gas/oil as part of the security agreement to have U.S.-led forces remain there. 

I would think Iran is off the PetroDollar. The PetroDollar is why the U.S.-NATO took out Gaddafi, too. Now look at what a mess Libya has been since. 

China and Russia have signed agreements to use their own currencies in energy deals. China's President was in Moscow over the weekend with Putin for the 70th of VE Day--most likely forging deeper military and economic ties. 

 




 WOW...surprising difference all those years and Hollywood films made! 




 is this that awful NYT mini-comedy wanna be documentary? (I hate the *NYT*)...when I first joined reddit someone posted it and I got in this 2 hour argument...i basically dissected it as propaganda with some funny piano music at the end...the *NYT* is one of the CIA's mouthpieces--even when they tell you the truth, it's not the *whole truth* 




 you can go to r/TSBD and find a free pdf of it...(see if you like it)...

one of my favorite books...info about the Marshall Plan is in the second or third chapter--like pages 30-50...short 10-15 page chapters--each one with great quotes... 




 The Marshall Plan was certainly important but the CIA also hijacked at least 5% of the funds to set up political slush funds which were used to alter the natural course of sovereign countries--Greece, Italy, France, Japan. This had a very negative impact and the CIA only let this be known to the public about 50 years later. (source: *Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA* by Tim Weiner)  




 Thanks for posting the TPP link--hadn't seen it although I've had a critical eye on the TPP since it came up last year. I've picked up sound bites on Bernie--Good Luck to him, but I just don't know if the system will allow him (or any other politician) to alter things.  




 I certainly don't want or think it will, but the expansive inequality is becoming apparent more and more everyday. Last fall (?) Target in Canada laid off 10K or 20K workers when they folded--but the President walked with $22 million which was equal to or greater than what the workers received as compensation.  




 Fully agreed.

The Iran-Contra hearings may have been the last chance to try to reign in the Cabal--everyone knew it was crooked and vile, but somehow the media just slept. Americans acted like they had just got done watching a 3 1/2 hour movie.

Then they elected "The First Ever Civilian Director of the CIA". 




 I have some relatives that are selling their house and moving to Costa Rica next year...they have visited there 3 times--gorgeous.

 My cousin was a Marine and went over for the Gulf War--he was a solid 180. When he came back he was sickly--maybe 145. They couldn't figure out what was wrong with him. Still has physical issues to this day. 




 Thanks...absolutely shocking. 




 Thanks!

I never heard of this...SHOCKING. 




 WOW. As a Anti-Corporate News Activist (ACNA) I was wondering if you could copy/paste this?  I refuse to read the *NYT*... 




 I've even heard that the U.S. trained Russian pilots in Alaska during WWII (not sure if it's true). 




 the SYSTEM IS BROKE...which is why I wrote this essay! 

I hope people think about it--maybe even pass it on! 




 Saudi Arabia has financed CIA projects since the Iran-Contra days--they coughed up $25 million for the Contras in just one year. To be clear--Porter Goss was formerly the head of the CIA and must be cleared by the government to work as a lobbyist for another country. Turkey has also been leasing drones from the U.S. for years (you can read the U.S. State Dept. memos on wikileaks) 




 NICE!

WWII in under one dozen words!

"ww2 was won with American material, British ingenuity, and Russian blood." 




 The decline of the PetroDollar could be why the U.S. is so hungry to overthrow Syria. At this point I'm sure there's much of the infrastructure there that needs to be rebuilt. I also think the thought of a pipeline going from Iran-Iraq-Syria is seen as threatening to corporate America (et al.). 

Rumor is Turkey along with the Saudis are amping things up to take care of Syria--and former CIA director Porter Goss just asked for permission to be a "lobbyist" for Turkey. 




 4 words: Trans Pacific Trade Deal...can't believe the public is going to let this slide by...but then after 2 illegal wars, secret prisons, legalized torture, NSA scandals, CIA scandals and DoD looting--nothing surprises me. 




 In fall of 2000, Saddam Hussein took Iraq off the PetroDollar in the Oil-for-Food program (he switched to the Euro). Alternatively, [Scott Ritter](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003) claims the U.S. was out for regime change in Iraq after the Gulf War ended--so the PetroDollar may have just been Saddam's final middle finger gesture to a determined pack of neoCons. (video link is 15 minutes of C-Span with Seymour Hersh). 




 must've been before the private contractors took over security! 




 very interesting--have never heard of Glubb or Todd...thanks for sharing the pdf--I will check it out...

Hopefully you're RIGHT and I'm WRONG! It just seems to me that the USG is focused on short-term solutions and in a downward spiral of overthrowing countries to take advantage of their natural resources (and let the corporations LOOT). 




 FYI: if you scroll to the bottom of the article there is a link to the **1 Page** NSA document the entire article is derived from--it is actually from an internal NSA history...how many pages are there that are still NOT released? (this was volume 1 of a 3 volume set) 




 For some reason I have a feeling it may start this summer--most likely in Syria-Iraq...if this happened I fear it could easily spread like wild fire in ways the generals and the think tank consultants haven't properly thought out. Paul Craig Roberts (who is the last link in my post) worries about Russia going nuclear...pretty alarming when neoCons like Dick Cheney are walking around grunting about it, too. 




 I would urge you to watch some [Chris Hedges](http://www.c-span.org/video/?303072-1/depth-chris-hedges) 









 I can easily see lists being drawn up of those who dare to speak dissenting words or ideas--this would most likely would be done by the intelligence corporations which are paid premium dollars (with our own tax money). 

The info likely is spread upwards into the official government lists--to be used when convenient. We know the FBI-NSA spied on peace activists in the 60's. They also spied on U.S. politicians, journalists and high profile figures. Among the politicians was Sen. Frank Church--who was on the Intelligence Committee looking into the abuses of the FBI-NSA. This was only revealed in 2013.

http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/09/25/secret-cold-war-documents-reveal-nsa-spied-on-senators/ 




 imagine if suspects were allowed 10 days before being questioned and allowed the luxury of being told the charges and seeing who was making the claim... 




 Definitely agree--I have posted quite a few free pdf files of books on [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/)--many of which focus on the CIA since WWII. 




 As per the homegrown resistance--one of the most shocking things I read was in Daniel Ellsberg's bio where he stated that within the Pentagon Papers he read that there were a few generals at the Pentagon who knew, from the start, that the US would need 500K to 1 million troops to properly control Vietnam. These generals kept this from the public--and from the President(s). 




 often it seems as if the Corporate press will report a story, then 2 days later there will be a retraction. 

the HEADLINE is often all people read, so the original (false) story accomplishes the goal: propaganda designed to instill fear or hatred. 




 For example, at Stalingrad: 

------------

The Axis suffered 850,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and its allies; 400,000 Germans, 200,000 Romanians, 130,000 Italians, and 120,000 Hungarians were killed, wounded or captured.[95]

On the material side, the Germans losses were 900 aircraft (including 274 transports and 165 bombers used as transports), 500 tanks, and 6,000 artillery pieces.[2]:122123 According to a contemporary Soviet report, 5,762 artillery pieces; 1,312 mortars; 12,701 heavy machine guns; 156,987 rifles; 80,438 sub-machine guns; 10,722 trucks; 744 aircraft; 1,666 tanks; 261 other armored vehicles; 571 half-tracks; and 10,679 motorcycles were captured by the Soviets.[96] An unknown amount of Hungarian, Italian, and Romanian material was lost.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad

-----------

Kursk: 

---------


Karl-Heinz Frieser, who reviewed the German archive record, calculated that during Operation Citadel 54,182 casualties were suffered. Of these, 9,036 were killed, 1,960 were reported missing, and 43,159 were wounded. The 9th Army suffered 23,345 casualties, while Army Group South suffered 30,837 casualties.[9] Throughout the Soviet offensives, 86,064 casualties were suffered. In facing Operation Kutuzov, 14,215 men were killed, 11,300 were reported missing (presumed killed or captured), and 60,549 were wounded.[295] During Polkovodets Rumyantsev, 25,068 casualties were incurred, including 8,933 killed and missing. Total casualties for the three battles were about 170,000 men.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk

----------

Moscow:

-----------

Both German and Soviet casualties during the battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Not all historians agree on what should be considered the "Battle of Moscow" in the timeline of World War II. While the start of the battle is usually regarded as the beginning of Operation Typhoon on 30 September 1941 (or sometimes on 2 October 1941), there are two different dates for the end of the offensive. In particular, some sources (such as Erickson[82] and Glantz[83]) exclude the Rzhev offensive from the scope of the battle, considering it as a distinct operation and making the Moscow offensive "stop" on 7 January 1942thus lowering the number of casualties.

There are also significant differences in figures from various sources. John Erickson, in his Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies, gives a figure of 653,924 Soviet casualties between October 1941 and January 1942.[82] Glantz, in his book When Titans Clashed, gives a figure of 658,279 for the defense phase alone, plus 370,955 for the winter counteroffensive until 7 January 1942.[83] The estimate of 400,000 German casualties by January 1942 reported in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, published in 197378.[70] On the other hand, Wehrmacht daily casualty reports show 35,757 killed in action, 128,716 wounded, and 9,721 missing in action for the entire Army Group Center between 1 October 1941 and 10 January 1942.[84]

Regardless of these disagreements, the Battle of Moscow is considered among the most lethal battles in world history.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Moscow

------------
 



















 Obviously, Russia was wrong in invading Finland and Poland--but they did fight for 2 or 3 years before the Allies hit those beaches...The U.S. gave Russia Billions in military aid to enable a large percentage of the German War Machine to be destroyed--thousands of tanks and hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

---------

Edit: Another important consideration should be all of the resources which Germany had to use to take their War Machine to Russia. Oil, gas, transportation resources for all the weapons and soldiers to go deep into Russian territory...  




 Thanks for the thoughtful feedback--I think you're definitely right about the USG primarily serving the upper class. The only book I've read so far that has exposed me to the history of socialist thought in the US was by Beverly Gage, titled *The Day Wall Street Exploded*. Gage is a Yale history professor and gave some backstory of the socialist movement in the US as she proceeded to tell the story of the [Wall Street Bombing of 1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_bombing). 

I found her categorization to be a little dismissive of the possibility that the US industrialists had ostracized the socialists because they were attempting to keep the unions from demanding higher wages (etc.). 

One of the most interesting aspects of the book was that she was unable to get the USG to release any files--even though the incident happened in 1920. She provided an appendix with notes on sources in which she expressed frustration.

It does seem like the US population is beginning to understand we are being misled--hopefully the Chris Hedges of the world will have a farther-reaching voice very soon. 




 I'm definitely open to that possibility...Scary to think the USG is but a puppet! It's obvious the politicians are...any good docs/articles you've seen lately? 




 Thanks...I stand corrected...I might need a pair of glasses! 




 [The USG allows the bankers to walk away from prosecution](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/05/no-wrongdoing-here-just-6300-corporate-fines-and-settlements.html). If a citizen transfers money illegally or commits mortgage fraud--we'd be locked up, but the banks are allowed to make out of court settlements with no prosecution on the record. But We the People must follow the ever-increasing library of laws and regulations now imposed on us.

The USG allows the DoD to write their own checks with [no audit necessary](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part2)--while the citizens and small businesses of the country follow the law and submit their taxes or face serious penalties. Every taxpayer, business, and government agency in America is supposed to be able to pass a financial audit by the feds, every year. Its the law, so we do our duty.

The USG allows the intelligence agencies to trample our rights and the U.S. Constitution--no serious investigation of the NSA has taken place. We do not know the true actions of the CIA-FBI-DoD because of the extreme secrecy. How can we possibly know if the agencies are acting in our interest--and within the law--if we do not even know what they have done?

The USG allows our law enforcement to [jail millions](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/13/wonkbook-11-facts-about-americas-prison-population). They would rather pay for our citizens to be jailed than pay for our children to receive the best education or provide training for those who need it.

Will we end up in another "war"? Will it be in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? Iran? Korea? China? Russia? Will it be because they attacked our soil or because we are protecting the business interests of the .01%?

The [USG also wages economic warfare against other countries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-a6jzU0YgQ) which leads to instability and is not a peaceful long-term solution.

The [USG would rather invade other countries and build military bases](http://www.rawstory.com/2013/05/authorization-for-use-of-military-force-a-blank-check-for-war-without-end/) and infrastructure over there than upgrade our own infrastructure. I wish most of our soldiers were employed out of the military--building roads, high-speed rail lines, and green energy infrastructure in the U.S (and around the globe--HELPING people).

The USG allows corporations to write our laws: agriculture, banks, energy, healthcare, media/cable conglomerates, transportation, tax laws...

FINALLY: The USG allowed our country to be attacked on 9/11 with no open investigation. In fact, our leaders openly resisted the investigations of both the [Joint Intelligence Committee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0) and the [9/11 Commission](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/911thebigcoverup). Evidence was destroyed, the investigations were [obstructed](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) and the evidence hidden from We the People (and the world). GW Bush couldn't even testify under oath and in public before the 9/11 Commission--he held a [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) press conference afterwards.

I do love America--but the USG is FAILING. Our leaders should be concentrating on helping us--the tax payers--instead of bombing other countries around the globe and leading us into another War. Who is running things--the Pentagon? the CIA? the defense companies? the bankers?

I seriously FEAR that WAR, INC will take things too far--and the Corporate Perpetual War may very well end up in [WWIII](http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/04/15/will-washington-kill-us-paul-craig-roberts/).

 I see what you mean...IMO the U.S. funded a great deal of Pakistan's military/intelligence (the U.S. gave Pakistan up to $3 Billion a year from 2002-2011)--it is also well-known that Pakistan is aligned the Taliban (Mark Mazzetti's *The Way of the Knife* covers this...pdf in r/TSBD)...

I still think its a somewhat useful observation because of the vast cultural differences between the U.S. and Russia. The U.S. has hundreds of years of embedded racial inequality and a much more diverse population which has, until recently, not been allowed to be seen as equals.

I see the statement as an exercise in how countries misjudge what they can control when they invade another country.  














 If this is the main reason for the Operation--then the DEA-FBI-NSA obviously have the means of capturing the central dealers by spying on the phone/emails/texts of those involved. The U.S. has literally spent Billions upon Billions of dollars for the technology.

I think its completely unnecessary to run an Op which clearly is targeting a very wide population base. 









 another GREAT article by PCR--here's the Meat of it (but I would urge you to read the entire article--especially the MLK quote at the end!)


------------

...in the cop culture that is America today, the Bill of Rights doesnt amount to much. Unless, that is, its the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBoR), which protects police officers from being subjected to the kinds of debilitating indignities heaped upon the average citizen.

Most Americans, oblivious about their own rights, arent even aware that police officers have their own Bill of Rights. Yet at the same time that our own protections against government abuses have been reduced to little more than historic window dressing, 14 states have already adopted LEOBoRswritten by police unions and being considered by many more states and Congresswhich provides police officers accused of a crime with special due process rights and privileges not afforded to the average citizen.

In other words, the LEOBoR protects police officers from being treated as we are treated during criminal investigations: questioned unmercifully for hours on end, harassed, harangued, browbeaten, denied food, water and bathroom breaks, subjected to hostile interrogations, and left in the dark about our accusers and any charges and evidence against us.

Not only are officers given a 10-day cooling-off period during which they cannot be forced to make any statements about the incident, but when they are questioned, it must be for a reasonable length of time, at a reasonable hour, by only one or two investigators (who must be fellow policemen), and with plenty of breaks for food and water.

According to investigative journalist Eli Hager, the most common rights afforded police officers accused of wrongdoing are as follows:

* If a department decides to pursue a complaint against an officer, the department must notify the officer and his union.
* The officer must be informed of the complainants, and their testimony against him, before he is questioned.
* During questioning, investigators may not harass, threaten, or promise rewards to the officer, as interrogators not infrequently do to civilian suspects.
* Bathroom breaks are assured during questioning.
* In Maryland, the officer may appeal his case to a hearing board, whose decision is binding, before a final decision has been made by his superiors about his discipline. The hearing board consists of three of the suspected offenders fellow officers.
* In some jurisdictions, the officer may not be disciplined if more than a certain number of days (often 100) have passed since his alleged misconduct, which limits the time for investigation.
* Even if the officer is suspended, the department must continue to pay salary and benefits, as well as the cost of the officers attorney.

...in the cop culture that is America today, the Bill of Rights doesnt amount to much. Unless, that is, its the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBoR), which protects police officers from being subjected to the kinds of debilitating indignities heaped upon the average citizen.

Most Americans, oblivious about their own rights, arent even aware that police officers have their own Bill of Rights. Yet at the same time that our own protections against government abuses have been reduced to little more than historic window dressing, 14 states have already adopted LEOBoRswritten by police unions and being considered by many more states and Congresswhich provides police officers accused of a crime with special due process rights and privileges not afforded to the average citizen.

 all because the US and the Saudis want to STOP a Syria-Iraq-Iran pipeline...(and because the US is addicted to WAR) 














 GREYSTONE

BLACKWATER

the CIA-Pentagon KNEW they had to CREATE AN ENEMY--otherwise the Defense Budget would continue to SHRINK.

So in 1997...PNAC was formed...Blackwater USA was founded...plans for 9/11 were refined

Operation Darkheart (1999-2000) was an experiment, a CASE STUDY--to be used post-9/11

All they had to do was STEAL the Election. 














 "Sorry, I can't answer your question because I'm a brainwashed State Dept. propagandist...Good Night!!!" 














 Regarding 9/11: 

1. How can the 4 hijacked aircraft have been allowed to fly in U.S. airspace with no reaction from the US military?

2. How could the aircraft have exceeded their recommended maximum speeds? The jets which hit the WTC 1 and 2 were each going 100+ ~~mph~~ knots OVER their maximum speed for the altitude...

~~http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=22727~~

edit: ~~the documentary goes into the maximum speed of the WTC flights at about 26 minutes 40 seconds)~~

actually, this is the video which analyzes the WTC planes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZrpNK4lJVc

 




 1. Do you think Lee Harvey Oswald (who was stationed at Atsugi AFB and working on the U2 program) was CIA or ONI???

2. Do you think JSOC (or their associates) whacked Michael Hastings?

3. Do you think Edward Snowden is a CIA Limited Hangout???

4. Have you ever performed an Operation which was targeting Americans on U.S. soil??? 







































 This is from a 2006 conference in Los Angeles which was hosted by Alex Jones...somehow it actually aired on C-Span.

http://www.c-span.org/video/?193155-1/september-11th-terrorist-attacks

(Fetzer speaks at about the 40 minute mark) 




 Even worse--these settlements do NOT result in PROSECUTIONS--the corporate criminals simply pay the FINE.

Even someone convicted of selling "loosie" cigarettes is placed on probation (possibly even JAILED) and the conviction goes on his/her criminal record.

These White Collar Corporate Criminals are allowed to BUY a GET OUT OF JAIL card over and over and over and over...with impunity. 









 SYNTHETIC TERROR SCAM: 

------------------

Late Sept. 2001...the U.S. sends in the CIA to Afghanistan to find UBL...CIA pays Afghan warlords millions--but can't find UBL...U.S. Congress approves initial $50 Billion for military...

Dec. 2002: U.S. funds the 9/11 Commission with an initial $3 million (another $10 million will be added in 2004)...U.S. spends $150 million on Guantanamo prison in 2002...

2002-2011: The U.S. gives Pakistan $3 Billion a year in military aid for 10 years ($30 Billion total)

May 2011: U.S. raids a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan to find UBL--they kill UBL and dump body in ocean

In total, the U.S. has spent over $4 TRILLION in Afghanistan and Iraq to find UBL and his circle who helped plan 9/11...so if there were 100 who planned 9/11, then it cost the U.S. $40 Billion to capture or kill each Al Qaeda member who helped UBL plan the 9/11 attacks.

$40 BILLION to capture/kill each of the top 100 Al Qaeda members who planned 9/11.

 awesome, thanks! 




 thanks for googling...all of those links are to articles which reference the original article.

what I'd like to see is the original article--but access to it has been blocked. 




 I just want ANSWERS...someone was lying--who was it? 

The reporters and witnesses who were there said the suspect was shot, while the BPD spokesman (who wasn't there) said it never happened. 

Why O' Why should we trust the BPD--they just got done LYING about Freddie Gray!!! 




 Shouldn't there be a resignation letter (or a firing) of the Fox News producer Mike Tobin--who called in Live On-Air to announce he witnessed ONE GUN SHOT???

 Nice essay...so sad that Americans would rather continue watching fictitious CSI shows (along with 100's of hours of useless sports per year) than actually ask questions about the most horrendous crime in our lifetimes. Even more appalling is their insistence on harshly criticizing those who do question the Official Story. 

Americans have an unexhaustible belief their government is good--Uncle Sam would never LIE to them. They have bought into the "Land of the Free" propaganda which they have been indoctrinated with by July 4th fireworks and forced daily childhood readings of the Pledge of Allegiance. 

In my lifetime, this Good Government Goo-Goo Crap was exposed during the Iran-Contra hearings--the CIA caught *in flagrante*, yet everything just went behind closed doors. Most of the country knew there was mass criminality--but the "Free Press" and the brainwashed population just gave it a YAWN like it was the end of a 3 1/2 hour movie.

 




 I think the fucking STORMTROOPER shot the man and the media is helping cover it up by issuing retractions...the [original fox news report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OkKa5g10Xc#t=16) was by a fox news producer (Mike Tobin) who was there when the incident took place and said the STORMTROOPER shot the man one time in the back.

watch the original fox report before it disappears!!!  




 "We screwed up and told the TRUTH...We apologize to all the hard working STORMTROOPERS in Baltimore."

--Fox "News" 




 **"We screwed up and told the TRUTH...We apologize to all the hard working STORMTROOPERS in Baltimore."**

--Fox "News" 




 not that I have seen so far...there was a 2nd witness who was interviewed on TV who said the suspect was shot "right in front of my face"...it looked like it may have been a local Baltimore station--the 15 seconds of footage was recorded on a phone and uplinked to instagram...now that link doesn't work--I will re-post if I find it again.

There is also a [PHOTO of a ~~cop~~ STORMTROOPER with his gun drawn](https://twitter.com/BmoreDoc/status/595324211318661124/photo/1) 




 Freddie Gray had a broken fucking spine--you really think BPD would call a medic because a suspect had an illness??? 




 BPD spokesman just told media the man is not injured and was NOT shot...If the man wasn't injured--then why did paramedics take him away on a gurnee???

 add to that the recent anonymous admission by a Florida officer that cops regularly LIE and PLANT EVIDENCE to frame people:

--------------

Jeffery Schultz: You mentioned specifically implicating a black person. Does your agency target based on race?

Deputy Sheriff: I wouldnt say target based on race but is is, you know, um, it is much easier to do this on a black person because they have no credibility anyways. The charges stick better to blacks than to a rich white guy that can afford a lawyer. That is one school of thought. Then you still have the deputies who like doing it to the rich white guys because they say it removes the smug look from their faces. They get their kicks from the power like its a game. Most cops though, they, um do it to get bad guys off the streets. The last group of deputies do it for personal gain.

Jeffery Schultz: Personal gain? Like what?

Deputy Sheriff: Sometimes a deputy will use the threat of planting, you know, dope on a person to get some cash or something from the perp. Uh, like a few hundred bucks can make the problem go away. Its pretty rare but it happens. Usually its the deputies that live large and need supplemental income. They tend to keep it really quiet because thats like, you know, really bad stuff. We even had a guy put the suspect in the back of his green and white [patrol car]to drive him to an ATM machine. We were all like what the hell is he doing? And another time a deputy arrested a guy for possession after he said he found the baggie on the guys floor board. Then he, um, he didnt charge the guy in exchange for oral sex from the guys wife. I thought that was, you know, really wrong. Taking things just too far. Way to far. But I kept my mouth shut because, you know, you cross that line even a little and you dont have the right to complain about those crossing it a bit more.

---------------------

Jeffery Schultz: How does this Sheriff keep his job? Dont the people in your county become outraged?

Deputy Sheriff: The people in our county wear blinders. They dont care what we do or if deputies are planting evidence as long as they keep believing the lie their crime is going down and they are protected. They only care about themselves and pretty much, that is fine with us. We get some of the highest salaries in the country, incredible benefits and cars that we can use for our personal use any time we want. No matter how bad our deputies think Sheriff Bradshaw is, money talks and as long as it keeps flowing into our bank accounts, we arent going to make any waves. And um, it is quite the opposite. Almost every civilian employee of the Sheriffs Office who voluntarily worked on the Sheriffs campaign got a nice, shiny unmarked county take home car they use when ever they want and gas paid for by the tax payer. Were talking like 150 cars or something completely obscene like that. Who is going to want that to go away

In the course of our investigation into the national response to the attacks, the 9/11 Commission staff discovered that the official version of what had occurred [the morning of September 11, 2001]  that is, what government and military officials had told Congress, the Commission, the media, and the public about who knew what when was almost entirely, and inexplicably, untrue.

I am 100% convinced that the attacks of September 11, 2001 were planned, organized, and committed by treasonous perpetrators that have infiltrated the highest levels of our government ....Those of us in the military took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic...it is our duty to expose the real perpetrators of 9/11 and bring them to justice, no matter how hard it is, how long it takes, or how much we have to suffer to do it. We owe it to those who have gone before us who executed that same oath, and who are doing the same thing in Iraq and Afghanistan right now. Those of us who joined the military and faithfully executed orders that were given us had to trust our leaders. The violation and abuse of that trust is not only heinous, but ultimately the most accurate definition of treason!

 I thought there was a video after 9/11 in which bin Laden had mountains in  the background...then they went to audio because "bin Laden" didn't want to be located 




 The CIA knew there were at least 2 Al Qaeda members in the US--yet they failed to notify the FBI. In fact, they ended up staying with an FBI informant in San Diego. 

The US defenses were lowered by having so many War Games being run on 9/11...Fighter jets were scrambled 100 miles away from DC instead of over DC.

An embassy official in the Middle East turned down several Saudis from being allowed entry into the US--the CIA overruled him and forced him to OK their entry visas.

 




 You could be right about the Israelis--but I think for the 9/11 Operation to be successful the US had to have it's guard down and there had to be someone inside making sure the Cover Ups worked. 

I think the US set it up using the CIA or the Pentagon to do it...the Saudis helped find the patsies (the hijackers), the Saudis and the Pakistanis helped fund it (wasn't very expensive)...and the Israelis set up the WTC...

But most of that $4 Trillion just went to make rich men even Richer.

Spreading Democracy was a sales pitch. 




 I'm surprised the US didn't fabricate the evidence--the US and especially the NeoCons had [regime change in Iraq](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003) as their #1 goal since the end of the first Gulf War.  
 




 you can just watch the WTC parts=2 hours

how do you get symmetrical collapse from asymmetrical damage?

 




 I don't remember that interview, but it doesn't surprise me that cbs would stoop that low. I remember the Freedom Fries and fox and nbc having on Scott Ritter for 3 minutes--so their hosts could tear him to shreds with insults. Funny how all those fox interviews seem to be missing on youtube.  




 100% WRONG. The U.S.A. has gained the most from the attacks--$4 TRILLION spent in Afghanistan and Iraq Wars (plus even more to the MIC)...

The US didn't attack Iraq for oil--the US attacked because in the Fall of 2000 Saddam had switched off of the PetroDollar to the Euro (and because Cheney is a bloodthirsty, greedy motherfucker).

As for the complete incompetence--YES--not one person even lost their job or was demoted. George Tenet held onto his job for another 3 or 4 years.  




 The day a cbs executive allowed their advertisers to affect the reporting of Edward R. Murrow...There is a scene in *Goodnight and Goodluck* where the president of cbs tells Murrow "my Wednesday night program costs half as much and I don't get complaints from sponsors" (paraphrasing). 




 Highly recommend that any of you who truly want some answers on the corporate media, Occupy, and the Iraq War should watch this [**C-SPAN interview with CHRIS HEDGES](http://www.c-span.org/video/?303072-1/depth-chris-hedges**).

The corporate media can spin any story upside-down in 3 minutes--these issues take in-depth coverage to even begin to fully understand. Until the population Turns OFF cbs, fox, cnn, nbc--we will continue to be fed Shit-On-A-Stick.

 




 There is no direct evidence that the USG had direct links, BUT...what do Criminals do? They hide evidence, they try to disrupt the investigation...

Footage from 89 security cameras was immediately confiscated from around the Pentagon by the FBI...Still, to this day, the USG has only released 3 frames of footage. (what are they hiding--its 14 years later).

9/11 Commission: [Our Investigation Was Obstructed](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/)

Sen. Tom Daschle: [Cheney Asked Me NOT To Investigate 9/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0)

It also took more than 400 days--and pressure from the victims' families, before the 9/11 Commission was allowed to proceed.

Criminals also try to stay out of the spotlight--which is why Bush would NOT speak to the 9/11 Commission in public--or UNDER OATH...what is so hard about putting your hand on the bible and swearing TO TELL THE TRUTH?



Any honest detective would be suspicious.

 




 Here's a great example of the rubbish the corporate media fed us (9/5/2002): 

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lawsuit-iraq-involved-in-9-11-conspiracy/

http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/09/05/ar911.iraq.lawsuit/index.html

Obviously, it's easier for the media to teach the viewers to hate than to ask real questions about 9/11 and get real answers.

 If he was working on a drone story...that could very likely involve the CIA. I thought I heard about some kind of Stratfor leak which showed that CIA madman John Brennan was cracking the whip like a stormtrooper on reporters. 




 CORRECTION: Only Giuliani commented on the temperature.

At 1hr 12 minutes of the *9/11 Exposed* documentary Rudy Giuliani states: "There were fires of 2000 degrees fahrenheit below the ground." (The source was nbc/today show)

At about 1hr 26min Gov. Pataki states the concrete was pulverized (fox news with bill hummer) 




 Thanks for posting...

Mayor Rudy Giuliani and NY Governor George Pataki even acknowledged the extreme temperatures...(I think their quotes can be found in the latest ae911truth documentary *9/11 Exposed*)... 




 I've read quite a bit about gov't committees and hearings--I think you'd be better off reading Russ Baker's *Family of Secrets* (if you want to get closer to the Truth). The gov't will rarely allow any real facts to come out--better to look into the Deep Politics...you should be able to find a few of Russ' chapters on his website: http://whowhatwhy.org/2012/05/07/watergate-revelations-the-coup-against-nixon-part-1-of-3/

"Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, **until some other adversary could be invented**. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."

 Paul Jay and Kiriakou also get it WRONG about what the CIA knew before 9/11...One part of the CIA knew at least 2 members of Al Qaeda were in the US--but didn't tell other parts of the CIA or, more importantly, the FBI...

in the interview Jay and Kiriakou act as if the CIA didn't know--this is false because the CIA arranged to have pictures taken of the Kuala Lumpur meeting--then they found out at least 2 members went to Los Angeles after the meeting. 




 [**118 FIREFIGHTERS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ4dVo5QgYg) reported EXPLOSIONS at the WTC...some of them even specifically refer to **DEMOLITION CHARGES POPPING OFF** 




 hmmm...wonder if they show Ol' Henry getting his nazi awards?

or the FACT that Ford owned a plant in Europe which supplied the nazi war machine with trucks.

Hitler's American Business Partners:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMKnH2BlkBA

 




 the CIA-FBI still hasn't released 1,000's of JFK files--it makes no sense to think they would tell us the truth about 9/11. I fully understand Paul Jay's argument, but it is extremely naive to think the CIA-FBI will ever release files.

 I think John Brennan took his ass down by either listening to Patreus' lovey-dovey phone calls with Broadwell--or he honey-trapped Patreus (in which case it is possible she is a foreign agent). 














 you can also browse the pdf links at r/TSBD...there are also tons of [used books](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/2hw8i0/list_of_cheap_dirty_conspiracy_booksmany_for_one/) at amazon--many for just one cent + $3.99 delivery (US). (no, I don't work for amazon--but if I can get a very hard to find book for $4 I'll take it)

I generally like to read the actual book, but use the pdf to see if I like the author's style/content. 




 The post would definitely confirm my suspicions about the mods in the larger subs (and many of the comments/voting patterns)--but there is just hearsay with no actual verifiable source. 

If the user could provide info, like next week South Korea will be pushed hard or a specific example of their work--at least then we'd have something to base the claims on. 




 Issuing a citiation at the hospital and releasing him for a DUI involving an accident with a parked car?

If his family wasn't prominent he'd be slapped in cuffs and hauled off to the clink until bail was provided and he had slept off the moonshine. 




 Russ Baker is actually quite conservative in his investigative reporting--that is, his research is generally very meticulous. He strains not to make any gross leaps of judgment, building fact-upon-fact and clearly notifying the reader when he does attempt to fill in the blanks. Most important in all this is the sources--the interviews he personally made for the book and the extensive list of books/articles which he cites. 

If your personal background has been very trusting of the government (and the republicans-CIA) the book can definitely have some shock to it. If you read something in there you question, then read the sources for the chapter in the back of the book. 

*Family of Secrets* is actually quite conservative compared to [Webster Tarpley's earlier book on GHW Bush](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/2culc7/ghw_bush_unauthorized_by_webster_tarpley/). It was actually the first book I read about politics, too--I have moved on and now have read quite a handful of authors and can judge what level of trust I can have in their words by comparing it to other books and sources.

Hopefully you will keep reading more books and learn what level of confidence you can place upon different authors as well--but the Source (the document or testimony) is always the most important aspect to analyze. 




 I think the failure of the corporate press has much more to do with the cozy relationship which developed during WWII. The US press became subservient to the military during the war--the relationship between the OSS/CIA/FBI became interlocked. The agencies began to demand the press hold stories and omit facts. NBC was owned by RCA--which produced radio equipment the soldiers/pilots used.

During the Gulf and Iraq Wars this became more pronounced due to the Billions the Pentagon was spending on advertising to get more recruits. The corporations completely lost their will to be the Fourth Estate and gave up their right to a Free Press. The corporate press no longer print stories--they check with the DoJ or the State Dept first, then they print (or not) after the USG has ok'd the article. 

I think it has become almost worse than the propaganda Russia often feeds its citizens because, as it is now, the citizens of the US THINK they are being fed the TRUTH--when its actually just press releases from the State Dept or the Pentagon.

I've never looked into whether this doc is fake or not--but Oswald being CIA seems beyond doubt. His work at Atsugi AFB in Japan required a high level clearance because that is where the CIA's U2 spyplanes were flown out of...Oswald affording the money to go to the USSR via Europe...Oswald renouncing his citizenship, then 18 months later coming back to the U.S. with a ticket for him, his new wife and his newborn--all paid for by the U.S. State Department--highly unusual to say the least...Oswald NOT being immediately arrested by the FBI upon return from the USSR...Oswald with George de Mohrenschildt (CIA) as a handler (his address is in Oswald's address book)...Oswald working at a High Security photo lab upon return (????-Stovall)...Oswald being seen with David Atlee Phillips (CIA-Latin America) by Antonio Veciana (he finally ID'd David Atlee Phillips before his death)...

Much of this is covered in these articles:

How many times is r/conspiracy going to upvote bunk to the top?  I've seen this happen 3 or 4 times in the last week alone...WTF... 




 FYI: Politico actually changed the title after their original post...I have reposted the submission with the new title... 









 I fully agree with you that Obama has been quite vicious--definitely not the peacemaker everyone thought they were voting for!!! Over 1,000 drone strikes--not exactly anything Martin Luther King, Jr. would approve of. Obama used to quote him often--but obviously forgot all about his "Beyond Vietnam" speech.

80,000 deaths in Pakistan since 2001 (even though we are not at war with them). You're definitely right about Libya, too--another country turned to chaos just because Gaddafi was switching off the PetroDollar. 

I think Syria has a lot to do with stopping a possible Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline. 210,000 deaths in Syria since 2010.

I no longer see this as entirely a republican-democrat problem--it seems the CIA-Pentagon get their wars one way or the other. 




 Short Answer: Oswald was set up by the CIA to be the Patsy--to take the fall. Many think Oswald worked for the CIA when he defected to the USSR in the late 50's. When Oswald came back to the U.S., the State Department paid his airfare--quite odd considering he was a defector (but not so odd if he was CIA)!  Then he passed out pro-Castro leaflets in New Orleans and was recorded by a tv station getting in a fight with anti-Castro Cubans (most likely a staged event).  All of these layers made him the perfect Fall Guy, some even think the CIA/Pentagon wanted to go to war with Cuba and get revenge for the Bay of Pigs (Oswald's commie background seemed to fit this possibility). 




 The chemical/bio weapons Saddam had were EXPIRED--no longer usable (they have a short shelf life)...Saddam was truly evil--but that didn't keep Donald Rumsfeld from shaking his hand just a year or so after he had gassed the Kurds. 

At least we agree that there were no terrorists in Iraq before the U.S. went in and created chaos. ISIS has a large percentage of Saddam's Ba'ath party and the Iraqi Army (which the U.S. broke up). I think one U.S. general even said what a huge mistake it was at the time...

The most recent death count in the Middle East is 3 million killed since 9/11 (includes Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Yemen).

Yet the republicans still want to bomb Iran--I guess they haven't made enough money off their WAR, INC stocks. 




 YES--exactly...the Wall Street-CIA mob. 




 Interesting--the whole Lindbergh kidnapping case always stunk to high heaven...any links about his father and his books? 

if you are just starting on JFK there are three great docs--all of them are ~~pretty~~ very long:  *The Men Who Killed Kennedy*, *Evidence of Revision*, and *Everything Is A Rich Man's Trick*...you can find them all on youtube...i would say it's best to see them in that order (which is chronological by release date)... 




 It's just crazy--if you look at anti-war.com they still list everyday dozens or hundreds of deaths in Iraq. the corporate media is rarely ever bothered with those body counts. 

makes you wonder how many journalists, editors and publishers have investments in WAR, INC.  

the corporate media certainly does make more money when the US is at war--the Pentagon spends billions to recruit, the defense corporations have to expand... 




 88 years old and the CIA **STILL** can't outsmart him. 




 He's 88 years old--but the CIA **STILL** can't outsmart him. 









 Mark Lane and Joachim Joesten were early on the trail, too...but no denying that Mae Brussell and Jim Garrison led heroic efforts as well. I think Joachim Joesten wrote *The Dark Side of LBJ* just a year or two after the assassination (printed in Europe).  




 Mae Brussell thought so, too...
