 The shortcut through the Corn field 

tempts you as you're walking home

the clouds above keep the moon concealed

As you enter the swaying corn, alone.

*-*

The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,

the path you chose is muddy

it grows in rows without scope or end 

and in the dark, you hurry

*-*

You don't see the standing forms

As you pass them on your way

they stand still amongst the swaying corn

which hides their pallor, and decay

*-*

hundreds gather in this field tonight

though you see none at all

yet still you look around in fright

but the corn grows too thick, too tall

*-*

You tell yourself as you continue through

"*Its merely the rustling of the leaves,*"

But they see you, and they hear you,

And they might not let you leave.

 Next time you happen to be in a cornfield at night, you will remember this comment. Because there is a distinct possibility that you are not alone in that cornfield. You can't see anything around you because the corn is too thick and too tall, but for all you know there could be hundreds of stationary, standing figures all around you, and you wont be able to see them. The thing is though, they can see you. And they can hear you. And they might not let you leave.

 A girl is playing in her room, when she hears her mother call her from the kitchen. She puts down her toys and rushes to meet her mother, when suddenly a hand reaches out of a cupboard and pulls her inside, while another hand is wrapped around her mouth to stop her from screaming. "Shh, please be quiet angel," whispers her mother's voice in her ear, "I heard it as well."

 If exercise is easy, you aren't doing it hard enough. Before you all downvote me to oblivion, this only holds true if you want to build visible muscle or lose lots of weight. 

While the body is ticking over, for example if you are jogging at a relaxed pace, your heart rate is slightly above average and your muscles are using slightly more oxygen. This is okay if you are simply trying to stay in shape, but not if you are wanting to drop weight etc. If, however, you carry on working until your muscles grow tired, your heart and muscles will be working so much harder in order to keep them going. So if you are running for a while and quit when you get tired, thats okay as you are getting fit and healthy, but not okay if you want to lose weight. It is people who can keep going through the pain barrier and force their body to work when it feels like it cant anymore that really will lose weight and tone up. The same is true for muscle building and weight training, if you are doing 3 sets of 12 reps, for example, the muscles for the first 8-10 reps will function normally until you really start to strain, when the muscle is working so much harder because it is tired. Again, it is people who can push themselves to do the extra 2 or 3 reps when their arms are tired who will build muscle most efficiently.

TL:DR - If you want to just stay healthy then exercise should be fun and easy. If you want to lose weight and build muscle exercise should hurt like a motherbitch.

 That is quite a slippery-slope argument.

What upsets people about the recent NSA scandal is that there seems to be a great deal of evidence appearing the ordinary, law-abiding, tax-paying people are have their phone calls, emails etc bugged or recorded. The NSA, thanks to The Patriot Act and other legal documents, are within their rights to do this, despite it being a gross breach of privacy for ordinary citizens. What has upset so many people (and quite rightly) is it is ordinary people who are being so jealously spied on by the NSA.

The crux of the argument is most people would agree that this level of spying is good when it is potentially dangerous individuals who represent a danger to innocent people being spied upon, but problem seems to be that  the NSA does not limit itself to that, and seems to have spent a great deal of time and effort spying on the American public en masse, as well as (according to recent news developments) various international offices and embassies.

This obvious does raise larger arguments such as the problem of deciding who represents a significant enough danger to society to warrant the level of privacy invasion the NSA seems to have wielded with such indiscrimination, and it could be easy to get drawn into a debate regarding racial, religious or social profiling.

So in answer to the question at hand: no, even if the NSA had successfully intercepted and stopped multiple terrorist attacks, this does not justify indiscriminate and Orwellian-like constant surveillance by the, or any, government on the population at large, as a whole. Personally I find the distinct and traceable rise of totalitarianism in American politics a lot more disturbing that potential terrorism.

 Actually, the first time Harry has Butter Beer is when he sneaks out of Hogwarts using the Marauder's Map and the invisibility cloak in book 3. He, Ron and Hermione go into 'The Three Broomsticks' to drink Butter Beer when Hagrid, Professors McGonagall and Flitwick and Cornelius Fudge walk in and force Harry to hide under the table. Harry never drinks Butter Beer in 'The Leaky Cauldron', only in 'The Three Broomsticks', 'The Hog's Head', Hogwarts and No. 12 Grimmauld Place.

Boom.

 Partially agreed. I felt the film was *in general* very well made and Henry Cavill did a great job, there was just far too much time spent where the film seemed to be saying "look how awesome all this CGI is!", the fight scenes went on forever and were thoroughly disengaging after a while, as well as the fight scene at the end. It just went on without development, i was actually bored by the end. The plot was a little weak and Zod's character could have been much better developed with a little more time, instead we just got a ton of special effects and endless destruction.

 Not strictly true and a bit over-simplified. It was actually Socrates who was instructed by the Oracle of Delphi to become a philosopher.

 This is the only sensible answer I'm afraid. Humanity will continue to search for the answers and maybe one day we will stumble across a new theory of everything. Due to the unlikeliness of physical evidence being found to explain the universe, it may remain a theoretical problem forever.

The only thing that is really certain as that as we continue to research the origin of everything the more amazing and incomprehensible the world around us becomes, but at least we know less and less about more and more.

 "*IAMA Crew member of The Californian. Don't ask me a fucking thing.*"

**Quick Edit:** The story of *The Californian* is surprisingly unknown, considering it's implications. For those who don't know, *The Californian* has been remembered by history as '*The Mystery Ship*' that was seen from the deck of *Titanic* as she sank. Captain Smith reportedly intended for the lifeboats to go back and forth from *Californian* in order to overcome the problem of the too-few lifeboats.

The crew of *Californian* had warned *Titanic* of three large icebergs in her path, saw her distress signals and heard her distress call, but mysteriously failed to act. To this day, no one fully knows why, as the crew acted very evasively upon returning to port and the on board record from the night of the sinking were destroyed by the crew.

 He editted his comment to use my picture, which doesn't really illustrate his point very well as only the summit of Everest is visible on the left 




 Correction: Everest *is* the most prominent mountain in the world, as 'prominent' means to measure from the base to the summit. Some mistakenly think that Mauna Kea in Hawaii is the tallest, however this isn't true as to measure climbing prominence you measure from the base, ergo the part you start to climb at. 




 The moutain in your picture is not Mount Everest, it is an entirely seperate mountain called Ama Dablam. It is in the same range as Everest, but hugely smaller. [Here is a photo I took last time I was there of Everest, Lohtse and Dablam.](http://imgur.com/B4HWHCN.jpg) Note: Dablam was a great deal closer to me in relation to Everest and Lohtse when I took the picture, they are a lot further away than they look. Only the pyramid summit of Everest is visible, and from some angles Everest is roughly pyramid shaped, especially from the east, assuming this picture is a sunrise.

**EDIT:** u/skatelinsy has edited his comment using my picture. This doesn't illustrate his point very well, as only the summit pyramid of Everest is visible on the far left. Lohtse is the peak to the right of Everest and Ama Dablam is on the far right of the picture

 in this case, BPD isn't a good acronym, which one are you talking about?

Many Bipolar individuals are manic for a few days or weeks, then will become depressed for days or weeks. 




 I know, someone already posted the video and I already said the direction of Kennedy's head was consistent with an exit wound. The Penn   Teller video I found painful to watch, I usually enjoy there material but that particular video was incredibly insensitive. 




 You're right, this does seem to be a little pedantic. The point here though is that some conspiracy theorists (not necessarily myself, as I say I am undecided) make the argument that Oswald didn't take the easier Houston Street shot because if he waited for the car to turn onto Elm (where Kennedy was shot) it placed the Presidential Motorcade in a 'triangulated fire' position, ergo Kennedy would be trapped between the Book Depository and the Grassy Knoll. 




 No worries, someone made a similar point! [here is my response comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ectu8/what_great_mysteries_with_video_evidence_remain/c9z7f47) 




 That was an interesting read, thanks for your input! The story is still full of holes though. From everything I've heard Oswald insisted outright that he was "*just a patsy*" etc, completely denying being involved in the assassination. So my point is this, yes the fuzz may have had a very small and circumstantial case against him for the murder of Officer Tippit, but what evidence did they have that he had anything to do with the assassination of Kennedy? I highly doubt he confessed and they only tied him to the Carcano Rifle *after* he himself was shot by Ruby. The only evidence seems to be that he worked at the book depository. Yet it seems within minutes of his arrest he is booked with the assassination.

As for the shooting itself, I have also heard the theory that the first shot hit a traffic light and ricocheted (hitting James Tague, who was standing by the overpass) and it seems convincing. Frankly, the easiest part of the story to believe is that the shooter was on the sixth floor of the book depository, although there are still loose ends here. The fatal shot does seem to come from behind Kennedy, although over fifty witnesses did report to hear shots from the picket fence, and (although I believe the 'Magic Bullet' theory to have been disproved ad nauseum) I have heard a slightly convincing theory concerning the Zapruder Film, which shows Kennedy clutching his hands to his neck while Connolly turns in his seat. The theory I have heard is that the shot that took Kennedy in the neck came from the front, while Connolly was hit seconds later by a separate bullet from the Book Depository. The evidence for this theory being that Connolly himself identified the moment he believed he was shot on the Zapruder film as several seconds after Kennedy has already raised his hands, as well as the Texas autopsy identifying the bullet wound in Kennedy's back as an exit wound.

As I say I don't find all of this convincing, these are just theories, but I do maintain there is a lot of strange and conflicting evidence. 




 I have no definite source, but from some very brief research I found that there is a theory that [this is the Babushka Lady's photograph](http://imgur.com/pQl91RQ.jpg). If it is, I'm amazed it isn't a bigger deal, and it's taken me this long to see it! 




 As much as I enjoy Penn   Teller's usual material, that was just painful to watch. Yes a lot of those people were mad as a bicycles, but what a terrible way to handle the subject matter. 




 I haven't seen that one! Just in case you (or other people in this thread) don't get the reference, it is from the film '[JFK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MLc0udf_74)' 




 Is you're last name Oswald, because you just blew my mind!

EDIT: [Ladies...](http://imgur.com/0jFtE4S.jpg) 




 Back, and to the left.

EDIT: There are several aspects of the assassination that still don't add up for me, the direction of the fatal headshot being the least of them (as many of you point out, the movement of Kennedy's head is consistent with an exit wound). Some point's worth considering:

* Oswald's Arrest - There is considerable confusion around Oswald's alleged murder of Officer Tippit and his subsequent arrest. Oswald was arrested in a cinema only a few hours after the assassination with over a hundred officers present. Oliver Stone comments on this as "the greatest display of police intuition since the Reichstag Fire".

* Kennedy's brain has disappeared. Seriously.

* Why not shoot Kennedy as he drives up Houston Street, its a far easier shot.

* There are several secret files apparently being withheld from the public concerning the assassination. If there was no conspiracy, what are these secret files about. I need citation for this, can anyone help me out?


I am not laying blame at anyones door as that would require more evidence than is available. But I am of the opinion, because of many of these discrepant facts, that some more than what meets the eye was happening that day.
