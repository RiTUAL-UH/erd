 "This is not a test." 




 Was hoping for nsfw... 




 I ask because it seems like every woman takes serious offense to the c**t word even if its not directed at them, and I honestly can't think of any male counterparts. 




 Don't the 90s include the year 2000? 



















 I have zero business sense and even less ambition, I'm just a guy laying in a beanbag chair. Ideally someone else would put in all the leg work, carry this idea through to fruition, then get super rich off of it so I can send them a screenshot of this post in a few years and try to get a couple million dollars in sympathy money from them, all without leaving my beanbag. 









 The safety is always useful, regardless of whether the gun is loaded or not because it provides an unambiguous indication of the weapon's condition to anyone, and secondly we are not talking about weapons with organic safeties we are talking about a MK17. 




 Yeah true. I guess that's why they don't put safeties on guns, they just assume the gun owner just constantly checks the chamber instead of flicking a pesky switch, amiright. 




 That's exactly my point. If you rack it and put it on safe, then you know 100% its safe. Then when you're done taking pictures of it to show people on the internet, then you can again visually clear the chamber, put it on fire, and release the firing pin to relieve spring tension for storage until the next time you want to take it out and take pictures of it.

 Put it on safe, dumbass
