Violent protests, including riots, and then full blown revolutions, are just part of a scale - the scale of "how much you're inconveniencing the government" with the "protest".

It's the *government* that should be listening to peaceful protests - such as let's say Occupy Wallstreet - but they don't, and then leave people no choice, but to "escalate" the protests. And when violence and window breaking starts, it appears to be "sudden", when in fact it's just the people letting out their old frustrations that are bubbling up. 









 [Halo](http://www.catholictradition.org/Saints/patrons-halo4.jpg) authentication. Calling it! 









 Along with an 8k resolution. 














 Great point. 





























 Wasn't France the one that broke international law and stopped the Bolivian president plane just on the *rumor* that Snowden might be on board?

 Or it could be a Mexican drug cartel using Chinese botnets. How do they really know? My guess is that if it *was* a Mexican cartel trying to get info on US government employees that they can blackmail, then the NSA wouldn't say it's them anyway, and would probably still blame it on China. There's nothing to gain for the NSA from saying it's a Mexican cartel that did it. What would they do about that (politically) - start *another* war on drugs?

Either way, it seems the US government is taking absolutely *zero* responsibility for the hack "well, because China...and they have good hackers" - or something.

It would be even worse if say Nigeria or hackers from Moldova got all that info. Because that would make *them* look like the main people to blame for it, as they would look completely incompetent.

Also, Recorded Future and I'm sure other security companies as well, have found that this info is [all over the web](https://www.recordedfuture.com/government-credentials-report/) already. So it really doesn't matter if "China has it" anymore. *Everyone has it* (interested enough to pay for it). 




 So when is end-to-end encryption coming to Hangouts? 



















 All SF86 forms were leaked, not just the data of OPM employees.

 Will 4.0 finally bring end-to-end encryption as well (both chat and video)? 

























































































 What about TextSecure's multi-party protocol? 




 Apps authenticating with the OS means significantly stronger "sandbox". It seems even the current mobile sandboxes (which are kind of state of the art among *mainstream* operating systems) are still rather vulnerable to hacking/malware:

http://www.macworld.com/article/2937239/zero-day-exploit-lets-app-store-malware-steal-os-x-and-ios-passwords.html

 




 OpenDNS will provide some security against *known* malware domains.

For privacy/anti-censorship it might be better to use something like https://www.opennicproject.org/ 




 Because people are completely clueless about:

1) how much data they are willingly giving to web services that they can make public

2) how much those companies track them

All they need to do is get that data from those companies. Many people say "I don't have anything to hide" - until something like that actually happens to them, and *then* they realize just *how much* they care about privacy. 




 I'm perfectly fine with this sort of limitation. Give 5GB a month at full speed, and the rest at 300-500Kbps. 




 Only if 500 million of those are pirated. 









 The Enigma Machine, Part 2. 
























 Great, the MPAA has infiltrated both the ICANN and the [W3C](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dont-let-the-mpaa-buy-the-web) now. 




 Apps that are authenticated with the OS seems to be all the new rage now. I want that. 




 CYBER CYBER CYBER!

And you know how we can improve cybersecurity? By asking all the major companies to put backdoors in their encryption and by collecting even more of everyone's data, which will be kept "OPM-safe" in the government's "cloud"! What's not to like?

 That's interesting - wouldn't this ruling nullify the "Third Party Doctrine" as well then? 




 The story of the Obama administration, pretty much. No one is ever responsible for anything and there are never admitted "abuses". 


































 Usually it takes about 10 years (8% density improvement year over year) to *double* the capacity for the same price (and size).

I really think we're going to see *at least* a quadrupling in density for batteries over the next 10 years. The first doubling is going to come by default as mentioned. The second doubling will come through a combination of Tesla's Gigafactories significantly lowering the price of batteries (so you can add bigger density for the same fixed price) and new "breakthroughs" such as this new manufacturing process, or by switching to solid state batteries, or whatever else will become reality in the next 10 years.

A quadrupling in density would mean even $15,000-$20,000 cars with 300+ mile ranges will become a reality over the next decade. Even if on paper you'd get a $20,000 EV that has the same specifications as a $15,000 gas-powered car (so $5,000 more expensive for the same specs, because of the battery cost), you'd still be better off in the long term because of much less maintenance, much cheaper charging and so on. So even if people intended to buy a $15,000 car, they would still try to buy a $20,000 EV because they'll know it will cost them much less in the long term.

When 300 mile batteries will be only $5,000 of the price of a car, EVs will start replacing cars *at all price levels*. 



















 But that's not the only thing. It's also Moore's Law. 1440p LCDs displays these days probably use about as much as 1080p LCDs used 2 years ago, too. The problem is when companies like Sony use those  2012 1080p panels to tout energy efficiency.

However, there's also the issue of needing a more powerful GPU. New Adreno GPUs are only like 30% more powerful than last year's high-end generation. Same goes for other GPUs more or less. 

















































 I thought it's at least a little relevant here, because I know there have been some discussions in the past about whether to enable encryption on Android by default or not. Although I think most here would do it *as long as there's hardware assistance* to make the performance impact negligible. 

Hopefully with Android M and beyond all OEMs will enable encryption by default, as they should all have hardware that support it by then, even at the low-end (Cortex-A53 chips).

Besides the given reasons in the post, there's also that whole other issue of scrambling your data so that when you sell your phone, you don't let others recover your pictures, or Google accounts and so on. 
























 But that would ruin the "nation-state villain" profile the US government is trying to put in Americans' minds when it comes to hacking.

It's much easier to pass new surveillance laws when "China is attacking us! We NEED THIS!" than "China, but also Russia, and Bulgaria, and South Africa, etc are hacking us...but also tons of random hackers and criminal organizations....and also that's mainly our fault for thinking encryption is literally Hitler so we shouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole and for securing our stuff so poorly because we invest 90% of our "defense" budgets on *offense*...oh, and we're hacking others much more than they do us, too, and we want to give the same powers to the FBI and the US police to hack anyone in the world as well."

I mean that already paints a much more complex and confusing picture about hacking and would make passing laws to give themselves more powers and strip away more of the Americans' rights much more difficult.

So "China is hacking us!" it is. 




 I agree for the same reasons. It's so much easier to "make it" in the US, because the market is almost completely homogeneous, making it "easy" to sell products for millions of dollars, and for the same reason to get investments of millions of dollars in your startup. It's a zillion times harder to do the same "in Europe", because Europe is so fragmented, and English not being an official (at least second) language hinders things as well. 




 So? That doesn't explain why the subsidies weren't cut let's say 10 or 20 years later. Subsidies should only be used in the early years of a new technology or industry to give that industry a "boost". Otherwise you could also make the argument that renewable energy should get subsidies for 100 years as well, until we're all using 100% renewable energy (which seems to be the rather weak goal of the G7 countries right now).

Yet, in countries like Germany subsidies for renewables were already cut after about 5 years only, and in the US they are about to go down from 30% to 10% in a year and I think completely gone by 2020.

The problem with leaving subsidies for much longer than 10 years or so is that the industry gets accustomed to that money from the government and doesn't invest in increasing efficiency as much as it should when they are forced by the market to drop prices below a certain price level. Or they simply pocket that difference in profit. 

The oil companies are some of the richest companies on Earth and have been for their entire lifetimes, yet somehow we *still* need to subsidize them - why?! Do you really thin that if their subsidies were cut, they *wouldn't* bring down their prices and cut into their own profits? Of course they would. Because if they keep prices at say $6 per gallon instead of $4, then many more people would be interested in buying an electric car. 




 Seriously, probably the best way to drastically increase the security of its systems is for the US government to switch to its own distro of Linux.

And no, I don't just say that because "Linux is more secure than Windows" or whatever, but because the fact that 90% of the world's computers run on the same OS means a TON of people are invested in exploiting it, which means it's not just a top priority for *many* governments to hack it (not just China or Russia, who would focus on breaking the US gov's Linux distro anyway, but others with lower budgets as well) and it's also much easier for them to buy exploits from the black market.

If the US gov alone used say a distro called "Gov-X", it would also be much easier to track those who try to exploit it and hack it. The same thing is futile with Windows hackers, as there are always thousands more waiting in the shadows. 




 Condoleezza is a real material girl, isn't she? 




 Because it can be abused. 





































































 My favorite part is how they say they only spy to catch terrorists, yet actively try to break "commercial security software" that would only ever be used by *enterprise customers*.  





























 Not sure if Uber fits in this so well. It's not that cheap...

Also, if Uber "wins" we're going to have one mega-corporation owning 50-60% or more not just of a country's "taxis", but of *all* of the world's taxis. That is the opposite of decentralization. Do we really want one company to be the "Google" or Windows of taxis? (in terms of market share). 












































 It seems like Microsoft would like to benefit from all the PR of "giving Windows 10 away for free!" - without actually really doing that, except perhaps for a very small number of users. 














 Upvotate de r/romania, un subreddit de calitate.

I know, truf hartz. 




 A glass/metal Nexus 5, better design, 3,000 mAh battery, 1080p (modern) panel, Snapdragon 820 with Sense ID and this hybrid auto-focus, along with 13MP camera with 1/2.3" sensor would be sweet. 




 Nvidia? Intel has been doing it for years by bundling its CPUs and GPUs *even if the notebooks already came with a GPU*. 




 In theory, it should be better. It has both laser focus and phase detection, that's the whole point of this video. 




 Sony has been using a 1/2.3" sensor for quite some time, and it's quite thin (Xperia Z3+ is only [6.9mm thick](http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z3+-6878.php) - just because Apple puts smaller sensors of 8MP that are thicker than that, doesn't mean everyone does that, too). At least I'd like to see more 13MP cameras use a sensor that large. 







































 This is why when the media says "the attack came from China!" you shouldn't immediately believe the attack was done *by China*. It could be anyone in the world using any of those tens of millions of zombie PCs to do their attacks - including people from the US. 


































 It's actually a smartphone that *looks* like a camera, not a camera that has smartphone functions. But Panasonic being a camera company, I guess it preferred to go with the "camera" marketing positioning (a mistake imo). 

So the answer is yes. 




  How do you propose a tax like this and still come up trillions short in revenue?

Who said you're coming up trillions short in revenue? Are you referring to that article/top comment on r/politics from a few days ago?

That article and top comment were only referring to the 14.5% tax on income and touting how then the government would come up short on revenue. But as this article here says, the 14.5% VAT tax would bring twice as much revenue as the 14.5% income tax. 

















































 How is the security compared to ChaCha20? Does it obtain its extra performance mainly by reducing the security as well? 




 And by that do they mean giving yet more billions of dollars to ISPs and carriers based only on the promise that they will expand their networks without actually see if they've followed through on that promise? 
























































































































































































 The US gov just lost a big trove of spy database (which likely included connections to UK spies, too) to Chinese hackers a week ago - and now they blame Snowden's 5 year old documents for this? Yeah, what's not to trust?! 














 If only they focused on actually mandating strong security and encryption in government agencies instead of trying to pass more surveillance laws.

The NSA is promoting the lie that it can "protect the networks" by acting as an anti-virus. From recent Snowden docs we learned that the NSA was already illegally doing that, yet it didn't stop the OPM hack, and it couldn't have. Security tools like anti-viruses and even firewalls don't work as well anymore. 

What they need to recommend is strong *end-device* security, not strong network security. So when a hacker tries to breach a network, with strong end-device security, he would have to basically hack every single device, rather than the network gateway and then easily get access to thousands of PCs. Google is doing the [same thing](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43231.pdf)(pdf) with its networks now, and it's what everyone should be doing. 

But of course the NSA doesn't want strong end-device security, because that would mean stuff being harder for them to steal as well. So the US government needs to decide once and for all if spying is more important, even if it means getting all of its data stolen as well, or actual security and protecting everyone. 









 The US gov just lost sensitive data for intelligence personnel in a hack and now they're trying to put the blame on Snowden's 2+ year old documents, but they are getting the UK government to do the propaganda for them on this. If you may have noticed the US and UK governments have quite coordinated public campaigns when it comes to stuff like this.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/06/13/standard_form_86_data_breach/ 




 They're trying to put the blame on Snowden now. Yeah, the US gov just lost sensitive data of millions of federal employees including military and intelligence people, and somehow Snowden's 2+ year old document leak is to blame for putting spies at risk. 




 AKA "more cyber". 




 1) ISPs can insert ads (on top of the regular web-based ads)

2) you can actually get [malware](https://citizenlab.org/2014/08/cat-video-and-the-death-of-clear-text/) this way  




 Start harassing them everywhere you can about it: Twitter, Facebook, comments. They'll listen eventually.
