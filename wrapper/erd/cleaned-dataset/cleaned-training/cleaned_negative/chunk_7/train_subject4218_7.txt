 It's truthful, though, which to some people is the highest thing a film can aspire to be. It's okay not to like it, but that doesn't make it bad. 









 Hard core truegaming answer time. In film and narrative theory, there's a school of thought that **meaning** is found in **excess**. Basically,that means that the bare bones of story have a limited ability to *say* things, and that the substance of a work is in what you layer on top of the story--the excess, if you will.

The literal textbook example of this is the work of a director named Douglas Sirk: he almost exclusively made melodramatic "woman's pictures" with fairly basic stories, but he's commanded a cult/academic following for the decisions he made in terms of color, pacing and composition--innesential to story, but crucial to how his films are interpreted. A more modern example is Quentin Tarantino, a filmmaker who's essentially made a career out of excess: broken down to their narrative elements, *Pulp Fiction* and *Inglourious Basterds* are fairly simple stories. What makes those movies memorable are the things that have nothing to do with story: the visuals, the side conversations, the allusions and music cues, *that's* where the personality, the meaning and the substance is--in the excess.

With Nintendo: at this point, the Mario template is an established narrative: jump on bad guys, power up, get coins and save the princess. The meaning of a Mario game then, is in how it delivers and diverges from that formula. I make the case here for *Super Mario Galaxy*: the plot is the same as every Mario game since the 80s, but the *excess* is a bizarre, sublime and surprisingly thoughtful abstraction of human exploration of the cosmos: gravity, our Newtonian rock in every Mario game ever, now varies with context. Representations of infinity are introduced: if you run forward in any other Mario game, you'll eventually hit the boundary of a level; run forward on a sphere in space and you'll just keep running. In terms of narrative excess, we have nothing less than [a living universe of star stuff lovingly experiencing itself, transforming, and being born again.](http://www.mariowiki.com/Rosalina's_Storybook) The Mario template is the means of delivery; the meaning is the stuff of *Tree of Life* and/or a particularly poignant acid trip, and it's a particular Nintendo brilliance that so much of this cosmic exploration is conveyed through the ever-evolving game mechanics.

All of this is to say, I couldn't care less about "new IPs." If new characters and settings are the best method to convey a new game idea then that's wonderful, but there's something enormously powerful about allowing beautiful games to draw from and engage with established stories and settings. You can overwrite Mario through a convoluted narrative arc, you can give him a dark backstory and complex human emotions, or you can tell a different story--a universal story--by running, jumping and coin-collecting through a whole new universe. 




 Don't forget visual design, not great with that either. 




 with all due respect, that's why preorders are dumb. 




 [Here's a post-RBF Scotty song called "The Hilarious,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdUaxsccTo) well worth checking out. Also, his side project album *[Better Bookends](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Better+Book+Ends/285653)* was a formative one for me--Scott's still one of my favorite voices, I'd love to see him record more. 




 I loved *This is the End*. The last scene was funny, but it didn't really match the tone of the rest of the movie--it would have worked better about thirty seconds into the credits, with the "official" ending being the ascent, that way it could still be included and get laughs without detracting the darkness of the rest of the movie. I guess that's not a question. Anyway, great job, I'm looking forward to your next directorial work! 




 Well, that's pretty obviously not the point. Printing guns with intent to sell or supply to others is the far more logical territory covered here, and I think regulating that is perfectly reasonable. If you print a gun off the grid for hobby or sport, and someone else, with or without your permission, uses it to kill people, you should bare some legal responsibility. 




 Hey guys. I'm sure that we can all agree that whatever value the correction above may or may not have had, everything after it including this was a waste of time. 




 This site looks like awesome, I just bought a sample poster with my own design. I play in a few bands and work on independent movies now and then; if this works I'll definitely be back for some big orders at some point. 




 Yeah, that's pretty characteristic of the site. Less emphasis on decimal point review scores, more thoughtful long form analysis--very much in keeping with the /r/games and /r/truegaming ethos, I think. 














 It's exactly that sort of equivalency that is fueling much of the Obama criticism, I think. Many on the left are eager to appear fair-minded and non-partisan and such, so they're attacking Obama with the same vehemence they did Bush. That certainly doesn't apply to all Obama critics or all liberals, but it is a phenomenon that I'm noticing in my personal circle. While this sometimes results in some silly comparisons--most of the administration's failings fall short of 9/11 and the Iraq war, in my opinion--I generally respect the impulse.

That said, the OP's point stands that people should be engaged in legislative races if they want to change anything. I think that a really good presidential candidate could get a lot done by consistently reminding people that there are other big races, and spreading awareness of platforms and records in the legislative arena. The old, statistically borne out adage is that American's hate congress but love their congressmen; I think people on the national stage who really care about change should address that as much as possible. 




 [Drink it up?](http://youtu.be/RKQ3LXHKB34?t=40s) 




 That's pretty much the point of the subreddit, isn't it? if you come in just looking for an excuse to change positions for ulterior reasons, you're not really operating in the spirit of the challenge. 




 Sometimes I'm pretty puzzled and surprised by what *really* makes me laugh. This is one of those times 




 I love Arrested Development and have enjoyed David Cross's other work, but he really comes off as a bit of a douche sometimes. 




 Exactly, we're all adults here. 




 That's an oddly succinct portrait of me as a ten-year-old

 I just want him and Jay-Z to play the [Grey Album version of "99 Problems"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2l-dvU9tOw) live. Just once. It would be awesome. 




 I mention this because I was just thinking about Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven." When you're a kid, the prospect of a talking bird who only says one thing is at best creepy and at worst silly. As an adult though, the prospect of the answer to every question being "nevermore, never again" is kind of terrifying: at some point, "never again" applies to everything in life and everything beyond it; it's pure, true, universal horror, and the more you think about it the scarier it becomes. Are there any other things like that that become scarier with maturity? 




 Having just moved here, this will help me feel a lot less generally clueless. Thanks! 




 Expressing clear regret and dedicating the rest of your life to personal and political improvement certainly helps. 




 I have to say, I have very little sympathy for this point of view.
Appreciate your life. 




 i said. good day. 




 It's either other individuals or the very idea of crowd-sourcing, but *certainly* not Reddit. Right. 




 The more this joke gets downvoted, the funnier I find it. 




 *shhhhh* 




 Gather ye black toner while you may. 




 Oh my fucking god you are impossible. I am sorry I try to avoid getting angry on the internet because I know it's stupid but I don't even know what the fuck point you're trying to make. You've switched your wording from "personal" to "private" information, but that was never the fucking conversation, Jesus *Fucking* Fuck.

**HIS *PERSONAL* INFORMATION, INCLUDING NAME AND FAMILY FACEBOOK PAGE, WERE SHARED AND UPVOTED IN A THREAD ABOUT TERRORISTS, DIRECTLY CONTRADICTING THE RULES OF THE [THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1cmtub/fbi_released_photos_of_suspected_boston_bombers/), THE [SUBREDDIT](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/), AND [REDDIT AS A WHOLE](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE A CONNECTION, AND IT DIRECTLY LED TO HIS FAMILY BEING SAD AND CRYING FOR NO REASON. THAT IS BAD AND THE PEOPLE WHO FACILITATED THAT SHOULD FEEL BAD. THE END. GOOD DAY TO YOU SIR.** 




 [The Boston PD did no such thing](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/it-wasnt-sunil-tripathi-the-anatomy-of-a-misinformation-disaster/275155/)--please read that article before proceeding. There is no evidence that the Boston P.D. ever named him as a suspect in public or private; please let me know if my objection is within the bounds of your comprehension now. :P

Incidentally, one of the users running the live update thread was actually banned from /r/findbostonbombers for his vocal stand against Sunil. When some random sourceless twitter user fabricated the Boston P.D. accusation against him, the anti-Sunil O.P. released that information instantly, accompanied it with the [Ron Paul "It's Happening" gif](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vpE6uMJ37dk/UOScrne47aI/AAAAAAAAEL4/Ki-4IWO-SoY/s1600/ron-paul.gif), and left if up for at least 20 minutes or so. The information spread from there, and the brave new instant crowd-sourced media became a joke. In case you couldn't tell, I was very disillusioned with the whole process.

As for the rest of your objections, you still seem like you're just trying to be difficult, but I take you at your word that you are not. It seems obvious to me that appearing in an unrelated news article a few months ago does not exempt Sunil from Reddit's privacy policy, that his tangential brush with journalism is no substitute for concrete evidence before tying him to terrorism, and linking to that article rather than naming him in plain text is not an acceptable loophole by any stretch. I don't think that a suicidal missing civilian is a sufficiently public figure for the purposes of this conversation, nor do I think his family should ever have had to suffer the accusations they did, but if we simply disagree then I won't belabor the point. 




 You, my friend, are driving me nuts right now. Literally every single point you made deliberately ignores context in some crucial way. Rather than type swear words at you, which is what I did three times before arriving at this draft, I will use your point by point rebuttal system against you, albeit in service of a coherent larger point rather than a bunch of persnickety semantic objections.

Reddit publicly releases names all the time. Almost every article has someone's name in it. A mere name is not in and of itself personal information.

**Context Ignored:** This was not an article submission. An article submission uses the names of **public figures**, as vetted by the journalistic standards of whoever published the article. Linking to an unrelated article about a civilian in the comments, particularly implying some connection to the submission subject "FBI released photos of suspected Boston bombers - Can you identify them?", is the same as naming them.

**You're Demonstrably Wrong Because:** Naming a civillian is and always has been a violation of [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), and it's somewhat baffling to me that anyone would think otherwise. This is why, for example, facebook screenshots are required to blur out names, and violators are subject to immediate account deletion.

I am arguing that they are not responsible for the actions taken by other people when following provided links. They are responsible for their own actions only.

**Context Ignored:** Their own actions were wrong. When they linked to the Tripathi's family-run facebook page--Rule III of /r/pics outlaws links to anything hosted on Facebook's servers, by the way--they enabled hostile traffic.

You seem to be arguing that they simply enabled *all* traffic in an entirely neutral way, but come on man. They routed a whole bunch of people *trying to identify murderers* to that page. Best case scenario, nobody does anything. Likely scenario, people will be dicks to a grieving family. In this context, they risk putting a great deal of unhappiness in the world for no particular good. Regardless of whether people are good or bad in that situation, that risk is a moral net loss in any sense, utilitarian or deontological.

No, you're misunderstanding my intention entirely. I used Google because it's an algorithm, not a person. If mere linking is the crime, then the algorithm should be banned because of the results it produced.

**Context Ignrored:** I am not, to be fully clear on an entirely obvious point, saying that neutral linking carries the same moral weight as linking with an agenda or linking in an intrinsically hostile **context**.

An algorithm lacks intentionality in the traditionally human sense, and therefore can't be be held responsible in the same way. I never said "banned," but a faulty algorithm could certainly be altered if it were suggesting irrelevant personal pages to universally hostile audiences.

Honestly though, that's a pretty terrible example. It wasn't an algorithm that submitted and upvoted links to the "Come Home Sunny" facebook page on the "FBI released photos of suspected Boston bombers - Can you identify them?" thread, it was members of the Reddit community--people. That's why I used people in my example.

Again, it's really weird that you think I'm opposed to "linking" on its own. I mean, seriously.

 Here's another way to put it. If you can find a torrent link using Google, is Google responsible for copyright infringement? Your argument is that the source of a link is responsible for the actions that third parties take when visiting that link. That philosophy would have an incredibly chilling effect on the Internet.

**Context Ignored:** Algorithms lack intentionality and therefore can't be held morally responsible, people can. Why are we talking about algorithms again? Pure obfuscation?

That's not anywhere near comparable to what occurred. It's more like your search term is "some guy who's whereabouts are unknown and kinda looks like a person who might be a terrorist".

In order to make your position seem reasonable, you had to completely blow things out of proportion. That should tell you something.

**Context Ignored:** I'm going to allow myself one swear word here, and call that an unequivocal load of bullshit. The thread that Sunil Tripathi's name and family-run facebook page were posted to was called "FBI released photos of suspected Boston bombers - Can you identify them?"

**Everyone on that thread was literally literally *literally* searching for the most wanted murder terrorists in America.** They were not searching for some guy who's whereabouts are unknown and kinda looks like a person who might be a terrorist. You're being ridiculous.

What are you talking about? Reddit isn't a court of law. We share web sites all the time, and the rules are clear: no personal information. There's nothing about "evidence" at all.
There isn't a higher standard just because this was a story about bombings.

Setting aside the fact that Reddit's prohibition of personal information *was* violated in no uncertain terms, I'm asking for people to use judgment that extends beyond  the letter of a terms of service checklist. Naming Sunil Tripathi as a Boston Bombing suspect with no evidence was **morally** wrong. Reddit users went public with bad information, real people were affected, we can do better next time. 




 I believe the line drawn was initially no publicly released names, which is entirely appropriate in that case. There was a secure tip line for providing relevant names.

You seem to be arguing that the people who linked to this guy bare no responsibility here, and that blame lies solely on rude commenters. Let's put it this way:

The thing is, there's a huge difference between linking to a site and making rude comments on that site. Is Google to blame if it helps rude people find your blog?

If a group of people at Google, however well intentioned, link to my blog at the top whenever you search "most wanted murder terrorist in america," then yes, that was irresponsible. Not to be a dick about it, but those people should be fired and the rest of Google should clearly condemn their actions. And if my family is inundated with hate and harassment, Google will have to bare some of that blame.

Edit: To be clear, yes, all of that stuff you listed was clearly and explicitly off-limits by virtue of naming someone without evidence. 




 Not his personal facebook page, but the "come home sunny" facebook page that his family had made for him. Just a collection of heartbroken photos and memories from the people who loved him--about an hour before Reddit linked to it they were posting about how they hoped he would come home to bake and eat ice cream with them.

So yeah, all that those consistently upvoted links accomplished was the facilitation of a bunch of hostile traffic, a bunch of demands for that poor fucking family to speak out if they had nothing to hide. And the funny thing is, there's *no fucking way* that posting that information on Reddit could *ever* help in the investigation--certainly not when the anonymous FBI tip line was available. It doesn't even matter that he was innocent; if he had been guilty then the FBI could have just investigated the accusation in private. There was nothing to gain from that bullshit, only a bunch of pointless sadness for his heartbroken family. Fucking shameful. 




 I feel so bad for that family. They had just put up something earlier today about how they hoped to cook food and eat ice cream with him, and now all this. The heartbreak must be be unreal. 









 [Here's some more info for those interested.](http://www.crutchfield.com/S-27S12WD9cpx/learn/learningcenter/home/antenna.html) I'm always a little surprised that more people don't realize this is an option, but combined with a Netflix-like service it pretty much covers all the bases. 




 Exactly. It's HD, completely free, and probably uses less compression than cable. 




 Jesus what a shitty novelty account. 




 You're basically right. If that's all that you were looking for, then stop reading now.

What's way more important than being right, however, is how you use those skills you're talking about. Your immersion in film should allow you to craft a more coherent and better-supported argument about a film's meaning, and your argument should therefore rule the day. At no point should your "qualifications" enter the discussion; if you're truly a "better" cineaste than your friend then your skill will speak for itself. When you make the conversation about yourself or your subculture, you're being a pretentious, insufferable snob and making the rest of us high-functioning, tolerable snobs look bad.

I would also say that film immersion does not automatically make your opinions superior--anyone who's been through film school knows that--nor does casual cinephilia make someone's subjective reaction to a work of art any less valuable. Again, substance of argument trumps personal background.

Being a good cinephile in the real world means showing your friends stuff they might not see otherwise, sharing perspectives they might not have considered, and having something interesting to say when they turn to you and say "but I want to know what [group film dude] thought of it." I doesn't mean we're better than anyone.

 Well, I think that'd be a stretch, but do what you want. 




 [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) dictates that one should, quite simply, not be rude. The all caps, and particularly the addendum about sucking his dick, detract from the value of his post. 




 Oh shit, Novelist Jason Bryan has spoken. Back off motherfuckers, he's an 80s analog soul! 




 I'm not sure where I'm going here

Yeah, there's the rub. You're attributing the jokes to racism and anti-drug sentiment, you then provide a list of counter-examples to your own unsupported premise, lose the plot and call everybody hypocrites.

I don't hate Lil' Wayne, I clearly don't wish death on him, I don't much admire him either, whatever. If that "lil' seizey" crack is what's got you bothered, then get over it, it's a joke about a pop star on Reddit. If you were looking to gush about Tha Carter II and III and the Dedication mixtapes with other casual fans who have listened to everything Wayne ever did, then bummer dude, it was jokes this time.

Honestly, I'd much rather see a Modest Mouse repost every once in awhile than these whiny self-righteous teenager "disappointed" posts.

 Sorry, whenever someone says "sick for the future" in any context, I stop listening. 




 This is the number one joke in my life that I insist on repeating without the slightest bit of recognition. 




 I used to play around with a much older version of Gamemaker several years ago, and I remember it as a very accessible GUI for coding pretty much anything you want within the confines of a 2D environment. That was well before the days of smartphones though, haven't kept up since then. 




 I often downvote simply because a comment is too safe and obvious for any interesting conversation. "Maybe it's just me, but the Beatles are a really good band"  I agree, fuck you, downvoted. 




 I'm sorry, what is the purpose of posting your Facebook argument in this subreddit? If you're simply looking for an online community of atheists to take your side against a religious stranger who argues poorly, then I think you know where to go. 




 Here's the thing: I was born in 1989, so I will never have the same experience listening to his vinyl collection as he does. Love the movie, but this kind of thing always leaves me cold--especially when everybody's going to get it on CD or MP3 anyway. 









 While the extent varies, I'm reasonably sure that some component of divine inspiration is central to all mainstream Christian denominations. 




 I can confirm it is totally legal and 100% safe, just a loophole that will probably be fixed soon but is great for those of use who can get it whilst it lasts.

Nope, doesn't clear up much at all. For my money, I'm completely unwilling to send personal payment to a stranger for an unsanctioned service upgrade, particularly if they're unwilling to offer information about who they are, their relationship to the company, and how this process supposedly works.

At best, I would guess that you're a Spotify employee exploiting your benefits for personal profit. At worst, you're scamming people out of $15 and/or their personal payment information. With all due respect, I remain justifiably skeptical and give your offer a downvote. 




 Hmm. It does indeed sound sketchy. How are you able to do this? 




 Ah, Reddit's featured content is based on user-submitted links and votes then. Just checking. 




 And where does putting /r/atheism on the front page fit in with the Zionist agenda, precisely? 




 "You came on the scene just as the plot is thinning" is an Apples in Stereo lyric, so "thins" is not unprecedented.

 I was extremely tempted to downvote you because you are wrong, but I'm replying instead so good for me.

Bioshock does not "present" objectivism in the way that, for example, Atlas Shrugged does, but it is inarguably commenting on it, so there goes your first sentence. If Atlas Shrugged-style objectivism "worked" intrinsically, then there should be no dystopia like Rapture possible--by creating a scenario in which strict adherence is observed but everything goes to shit regardless, Bioshock proves that objectivism is at best impotent, and at worst destructive--I'd argue more for the latter.

Because you think Rapture is unobjectivist, I assume you're taking for granted that the ideology was not strictly observed by the characters in Bioshock. If you're assuming they're different simply because things turn out differently from Atlas Shrugged's positive spin, then you're not really engaging with either work. I'd be interested in hearing where you think they diverged. 









 NO interest in new instruments, and it is in fact crucial to me that my old instruments work after a console upgrade. Gameplay-wise I think it'd be cool to see some sort of story beyond "become famous," and perhaps something a little more experimental/creative in terms of song performance. 









 dude you fucked up your time to shine with racism. 




 Come on now. It's 100% possible to have a principled vote based on policy stance parallel to appreciation of a very unique and sincere display of presidential emotion--this man has literally put up with more bullshit than anyone in the world over the last four years, and it's gratifying to see that he's still committed to the stuff I believe in. If you want to write off 61170405 votes as "pshhh guess they're all just *in love with him*," then that's your business, but it seems like a bizarre and sweeping generalization with no supported link to liberal values. 




 Here's the thing though: they *did* take their name from the Boston Tea party, right? As in, time for a revolutionary war against tyranny? And unless I'm mistaken, they surfaced shortly after Obama was elected, but before he had accomplished much? Bush enacted the bank bailout--why does Obama spark a call for revolution?

I honestly believe that there are well-meaning libertarians who got swept up in the Tea Party, but it's always been a radical fringe group with fear at its core--fear of change, fear of Other, fear of brown people, take your pick.

 I'd agree that "The Luckiest" and "Still Fighting It" are, but "Julianne," "Not the Same," and "Underground" are about sex, drugs, and rock and roll respectively. There are more mature, monogamous rap songs like "Paris, Tokyo" and the like, but these are outliers in rap, pop, and rock generally. 




 Do you listen to music or do you just skim through it?
