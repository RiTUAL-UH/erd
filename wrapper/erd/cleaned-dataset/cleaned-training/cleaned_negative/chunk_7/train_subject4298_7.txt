 "baseless" lol, you're funny...  




 it doesn't matter that the enemy looks different if it's the exact same process over and over again. Swing, take a step back, swing again 




 Yes? ......what do you mean "allergic reaction?"

 Forgive me Father for I have sinned... I masturbated to a picture of *you* 




 I can cum over here

I can cum over THERE!

I can cum on her feet

I can cum in her hair!



I can cum in her mouth or down south

On her blouse in the house, 

On her face in this place

In her eye, but it'd make her cry



Hell, I can cum **any** place!

I shall, I SHALL cum on her face!

 I haven't been watching the video, just listening to the audio. There's been some nuggets of comedy gold in it, but yeah, the game is so repetitive.  




 swinging at the same things over and over and over and over and over again, then healing 




 Jon is signed with Polaris. Theory disputed 




 Doing a voice without showing his face that COULD be him, but he does it so well there's no way to be sure, making people argue about it for weeks until it's finally revealed 




 lol, and the people who think it's true...

XD 




 This is why:

 I think it got upvoted by the people who don't understand what Polaris/Maker is and their relationship with GG 




 If anyone is manufacturing controversy, it's the Grumps and Jon themselves. Multichannel Networks wouldn't waste their time doing this because they get such a small percentage of ad revenue from their users. It's not a productive use of their time

 Thank you. There are SOO many friends on my facebook that I'd like to copy/paste what you said into their comment threads... ya know what? I'm gonna go do that 









 As long as Arin and Danny are there, it would be the funniest Table Flip in history 




 and Arin comes in as Obi-Wan to defeat him 




 It's possible that he was only in LA to film various Youtuber's cameos. Maker has a studio in New York, which he could've been there working on his side of the live-action bits (which are very minimal compared to the gameplay footage) 




 I was fully expecting it. It showed two X-Wings immediately after he said that and I thought it would be Dan and Arin 




 yeah, dafuq did he say? 




 "Let's begin the prostate exam" 




 /r/im14andthisisdeep 




 Oh say can you see?
Someone posted original content...

DOWN VOOOOOOOTE!!!

DOWN VOOOOOOTE! 

Down vote it to Hell! 




 It is a decent game, but it's the weakest one in that era of Final Fantasy games (they'll never top 9 though) 




 shoulda waited till the new one was completed. There might be some AMAZING moments in the future that won't be in this compilation 




 have you considered that he has a significant other that he doesn't discuss on the show? He's talked multiple times about not wanting to discuss his private life on the show.

Also, the whole "banging chicks" thing IS a part of his CHARACTER'S persona! Danny Sexbang and Dan Avidan are two different people (one is fictional, if that gives you a hint)

Lastly, why would "not having a significant other" make him gay? Are only gay people allowed to be single? Or are gay people not allowed to have significant others?

This is a big reason he wouldn't want to discuss his private life. Creepy posts like this 




 "Put it DEEP in her butt son.... if she struggles, give her the Ol' 1-2, POW!" 




 There are people who didn't previously listen to Rush?

My god...  




 anywhere on this sub where the topic says "Jon Mentioned" 

sift through those until you find them.

The only one that comes to my head right now is in Legend of Zelda 2, when Arin brings up Jon and his Abortion conversation from the Joe and Mac game 




 multiple times 




 Mountain Dew: We **almost** called it "Mountain Do-Dew!" 




 damn, I can see where Sharon gets her huge tits! So, can I meet the mother now? 




 Roses Are Red

Violets Are Blue

Niggas Are Black

And Imma shoot you 




 "Your dad said she's GREAT at giving head. Go getter, son!" 




 So basically, just stop with the Vent Grumps? Makes sense 




 In Hell, where they belong 




 Spore 




 Occasional decent criticisms, but primarily populated by nitpicking, whining, and child-like behavior 




 AHAHAHAAHAHAHA :D :D 




 I take it the guy in the white shirt was squad captain? 




 Oh! BURNED! 




 what the fuck was his goal? 




 It would take longer to render (and ten+ minute videos already take an insane amount of time) and upload 




 Am I the only one that read it in a crying, exasperated teenager's voice? 




 This movie doesn't have any black people in it, does it? 




 This is called "Purgatory..." It's nothing but a white light, empty space, and nothingness 




 Hi Steven!

"Hi, Bill!" 




 MMm! I'd cum on HER face without permission! :D 




  fuck these roman sympathizers. 

Best thing I've read all day 




 no, you got it backwards, Dan punched Train 




 don't know why you were downvoted for being helpful 




 There are people who use the "what to watch" instead of the "my subscriptions?" Wow... this frightens me as an up-n-coming youtuber knowing that my subscribers might not see my videos since they're not using youtube correctly. 




 Sorry, I meant the one with Oney 




 is that stream available anywhere? 




 Table slapped Flip's girlfriend 




 Arin 




 but it had the best joke in the whole series!

"Wow, look at all the places you've died!" 




 it's just you 




 can't you buy stickers of the grump heads? I'm not sure if that's part of their merch or not, it'd make sense if it was.

Anyway, just tell him to put stickers on it 




 k 




 I'm sick of those crying onions 




 I think what pisses me off the most about stuff like this is the "obey" on the tv. How in the world could a piece of fiction meant to do nothing but entertain you for a short period of time force you to "obey" anything? 




 Not a lame, "deep" post, just factual information 




 he was too busy wiping away the tears to type 




 while I don't think it was censored, To be fair, we have no way of knowing how much gets edited out of their conversations. We've heard plenty of "Barry, edit that out" which gets superseded by someone saying "don't" but we don't know how many times we get a "edit that out, and replace it with THIS" 




 6/6/6 would fap to again 




 start a band 




 You lost me at "an amazing gamer who understands the depths of games"

Where in the entire history of his career did you get the impression of either of those statements? 




 lol, "Ya know, this painfully difficult game here is actually the reason why I left Game Grumps! Arin wanted to finish it AND play all the others! I was like FUCK-DAT! and I packed my shit and fled all the way across the country to avoid it!" 




 you are what you eat 




 When would whites eat food prepared by The Shadow People?

And when would The Shadow People have jobs? 




 What's grosser than gross? When you sit on your grampa's lap and he gets a boner.

What's grosser than that?

When you sit on your grandma's lap and SHE gets a boner! 




 un-upload this 




 Can you sing while gargling hot sauce? You better *hope* you can! 




 Scoot over... 




 This is nothing but a bunch of fake accounts Ryan and Drew made to make fun of my baldness again! 




 Jigsaw is getting lazier with his traps... This is just a landmine with a 100 dollar bill taped to it.  




 No, dude! When I said we were having a **clan** meeting, I was talking about our Call of Duty clan! Why are you dressed like a ghost? 




 He just kinda passed over a whole series in the first episode, so he might do the same with the Super Star Wars series. They all are kinda the same and it'll probably be one or two jokes about all of them and how hard they are before he moves on 




 How do you know a bullet to the head is painful unless you've done it? 




 Frodo.... **Share the Load!**

(Funky music begins as Frodo starts stripping) 




 "You always think you're right!"


"FUCKING DUH, I think I'm right! That's why we're having an argument!" 




 Whose got three thumbs and was born with a deformity?

...THIS GUY! 




 Be careful getting some of that "15 teen pink"

You can go to jail for that shit 




 Shadow the Hedgehog was a good game, but they acted like it was 06' the whole time. I'd hate to see that attitude translated to them playing some of the best games ever. (like it already has with Mario64) 




 Because he has poor analytical skills when it comes to video-games. 




 It's been 23 years since I was pooped out of your birth-hole. Thank you for not aborting me :)

Love, Steve 




 Ms Jones, I'm afraid to inform you that you have had a miscarriage 




 "MMmm, that cake was delicious! I wish I could have some more without worrying about getting fat! OH wait! I have JUST the thing!"
