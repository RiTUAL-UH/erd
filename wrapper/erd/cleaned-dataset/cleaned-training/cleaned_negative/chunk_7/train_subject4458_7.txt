 Haha I guess that's what I'm trying to get at, what in the game is considered a projectile and what's not.  Also it says in the description for RBAY "Reflects **most** enemy projectiles during tornado" so I figured there were some exceptions.  I'll add the clarifications on my original post 




 EDIT: I guess what I'm trying to ask is what is considered a projectile in Awesomenauts and what's not, also in the description of RBAY it states  
Reflects **most** enemy projectiles during tornado
