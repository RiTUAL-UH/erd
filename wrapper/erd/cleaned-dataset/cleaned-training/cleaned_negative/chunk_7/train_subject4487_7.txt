 A privy is sort of like a maker's mark, it identifies/differentiates the coin.  [Take a look at some images](https://www.google.com/search?q=privy+mark source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=3sNbVYrZBMLGogS55oDACg ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ biw=1658 bih=894), you'll notice the addition of little emblems on the coins (like animals), that's the privy mark.

Privy's typically have much lower mintages, which makes them (in theory) more valuable/collectible due to supply demand.

  Why would this not hold its premium?

Because dealers hit you coming and going (they make $ at either end of transactions). 




 Why don't you just fuck with them.  Tell them you'll send a check for $100.  If they call you back, tell them you sent a check 2 weeks ago for $100, didn't they get it?  Apologize then tell them you'll send out a check tomorrow for $150 and that you're really, really sorry they didn't get the first one.  If they call back, relay the previous two stories, then repeat, but up the check to $200.  Gosh, I don't know what's going on, do you guys have a new address?  Rinse and repeat.

The best pleasures in life are free.

I used to have a collection agency call my # asking for a Maribella (I'm a dude).  I ended up just pretending to be her at a certain point. It was great, you know, a guy pretending to be a girl, "yeah, this is Maribella...Wait, what are you calling about?....How much?....Yeah, I'm not going to pay that....Why?....Why should I? You can't collect on it, it's free money" (arguments about my morality continued).  They eventually stopped calling...At one point I just googled Maribella's full name, found her Facebook page where it listed her employer in Beaverton.   I eventually asked to speak to a supervisor and relayed this info and let him know his staff were morons. I found her in literally 20 seconds. Our calls went on for months.

 Hello all,

I'm looking for some free screen recording and basic editing software (**Windows 7 Home Premium**) that will allow me to do some [programming screencasts like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO07THdLWQo).

I'll be uploading the videos to youtube.

I thought about just doing a google hangout as I'm going to be doing all the screencasts "live",  but I want the ability to stop recording my screen as well as edit my screencasts just so I'm not including a bunch of dead air/crap as I go consult APIs or hit some stumbling blocks or what have you.

I don't need the ability to do the [screen-in-screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKmBt5HDVNI list=PLViRFZPCqDBfkfF0FFbsCVbuMzuoUV6LA) type of screen recording as I don't have a webcam (I built my own PC).

Anyone have any suggestions for Windows 7 Home Premium?

Has anyone used any of these?

 That's a good point about the serial #s.  This is why I engrave my luggage combination into every piece of silver I buy.

 JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) aren't cookies, they're tokens that are passed back/forth between client and server. You can use them (JWTs) to handle your authorization, what traditionally was done using cookies.

But maybe I'm confused as I'm honestly not that bright...I'm not sure what you mean by "there's a JWT cookie".  I've also only used JWT in one app to date, so I'm certainly no expert. 









 How about using JWTs? To kill the associated session, just kill the JWT in localstorage.

 You're most likely going to get a lot of CS-type questions for any engineering position at Google. A LOT of front-end folks these days are the traditional CS types (what we think of the traditional back-end guys). Front-end is the new hotness, especially with the major shift in JavaScript development. 




 I worked with a guy at Yahoo back in 2008 that went to Google as a front-end developer so I wouldn't say Google  "is still new to that area of hiring".

 It can be read by screenreaders, though it's not guaranteed.  ARIA attributes have varying level of support across various screenreaders (just like web browsers).

 It provides more info to the user. 









 Use it when you want to establish a **relationship** between elements/widgets and text that describes them.

Note how the value of the aria-describedby attribute matches the corresponding id attribute which provides a description/more info to the user:

    button aria-label="Close" aria-describedby="descriptionClose"X/button

        Closing this window will discard any information entered and return you back to the main page

 Even if silver files a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, hoping to reorganize its finances, instead of a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy, it typically must cancel and eliminate its original silver, making that silver worthless. Should silver successfully reorganize and become financially sound, it will usually issue new silver, leaving former stackers with worthless silver. If former stackers believe silver will now succeed, they must buy some of the new post-bankruptcy silver should they want to continue their investment.
