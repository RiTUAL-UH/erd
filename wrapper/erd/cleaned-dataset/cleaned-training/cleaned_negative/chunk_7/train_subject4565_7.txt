 I've been trying this with Game of Thrones (not a film, but cinematic enough to be relevant). Reading the books helped because of all of the key context you miss, but I still find the show itself hard connect to. It all feels like set-up, but for events you don't always feel are inevitable. There's never a catharsis, just stuff happening - some of which is shocking.    
It's entertaining, but it's way overrated. 




 We're going to need a new abbreviation for 'significant other' now that SO is being used for Shower Orange. 




 And found out Wayne wasn't her biological father after all, it was actually Hank Pym! 




 That's not the ending, though - that's the series as a whole. People blame the ending, when in fact they should blame the show itself. The final moments are unrelated to the mysteries.    
edit: expanded upon final sentence 




 I've heard the same about Twin Peaks. 




 Despite several fantastic episodes, the final season commits some awful TV crimes. There were many moments I'd absolutely consider let downs...yet people bash *the ending*?! The last 15 minutes of the show were magnificent, and redeem most of that season. Much of what came in the episodes before it? Dreadful. That's what the backlash should be directed towards, not the ending - which 90% of people don't actually understand - [spoiler](/s "they weren't dead the whole time.")    
    
This shouldn't reflect on people's view of the show in general, though. How does one final season make an entire show a let down? 




 They can be a new acting quartet - a package deal called the Fantastic Four or something. 




 It's the korrasamilluminati, right? 




 Pike - 36   
Dormer - 33    
Not that much older 




 With Kate Mara as Jenny and Jamie Bell as Lt. Dan? 




 Great things about living in New Zealand: earliest timezone, and getting Marvel movies first. 8 days until Age of Ultron! 




 That's Arya, not Aria.    
There's only one rule on Omega: DO NOT FUCK WITH ARIA. 




 I assumed the same because of those hints, but it's not uncommon for a woman to propose to a man. 




 Just clarifying, you're a dude, right? I think it's implied (LGBT, religious parents may disapprove etc.) but just checking.    
Either way, damn touching story. 




 I can picture Hardy snatching up the role after Mad Max: Fury Road does well. That film has been test screening for over a year with ridiculously positive reactions. 




 I couldn't think of a more relevant username for an OP. Well done! 




 Hola Unblocker could also use your IP to frame you as a child pornographer, so it's a win-lose situation. 




 I really liked the episode before TRACKS - the one at the SHIELD academy. That was the first super compelling episode in my opinion. 




 **:O** 




 YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE WIRE?! 




 I'm very blonde, with quite dark eyebrows. I'm a guy. 




 I'm a bigger fan of [Jigsaw Falling Into Place](https://youtu.be/GoLJJRIWCLU). 




 Not any currently existing Spider-Man movie, though. 




 Ron Howard has stepped down as director. 




 They were making a Sony joke. 




 As much as I think DT will be scarily easy for a studio to fuck up, I'd still rather see this than the Ghostbusters Cinematic Universe. 




 I was suggesting an alternative. Read my other replies - I don't have a problem with the idea. I'm not racist for preferring other actors over Elba. 




 SUNG KANG FOR BOND! 




 So, alternatively, we should just encourage them to continue to recycle the same old shit? 




 I agree. 




 It wouldn't be a problem. I'm not opposed to the idea, I just think it's unnecessary. He could be the head of a new 00 franchise and build upon a new awesome character in the same MI6 universe, and be more internally canonically consistent than 007 ever was. Recasting Bond as a black guy? It's a bit pointless in comparison to what could potentially be a new and refreshing franchise. 




 [It doesn't need to be James Bond himself, though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/321vnb/james_bond_should_not_be_black_says_first_black/cq7g0tc)    
You seemed quick to assume I was against the idea. I was only suggesting an alternative. 




 Why can't Elba just play an original black character? He'd play a great spy, but we don't need to raceswap anyone just to give a great black actor a great action star role. 




 They're likely cancelling the Blu-rays as well. 




 Scream was the same. Matthew Lillard in nutcase-mode turned it into a comedy. 




 What about Penelope laying spread-eagle at the beach, sensually moaning "OOOH ODYSSEUS!" as the water washed up into her crotch? 




 Legendary are with Universal now, so it's actually slightly more possible. 




 Placing my bet right now: Jurassic World 's gross will be absolutely dwarfed by Star Wars, Avengers and Furious 7. 




 /u/Strike48 used to be right, though. You couldn't use it at all. 




 [How dare they copy Willy Moon?!](https://youtu.be/GaWXA5e0YTQ) How artistically bankrupt do you have to be to plagiarise the inventor of the suit? 




 [Exception.](https://youtu.be/mEpupr4saKo) 




 What plot twist? 




 And *that's* why you don't teach lessons! 




 Ditto. 




 I can't stand it when people say that Seasons 1   2 are the best. They are great, but I see it as they compliment Seasons 3-6 by giving all of the necessary character background so that when the show goes batshit off-the-wall bonkers, you care about the characters enough to go along with it. 




 **DON'T    DEAD
OPEN     INSIDE** 




 Let Down is electronic? 




 Interstellar. That moment at the end where you realise they're about to try to one-up 2001, and Murph's ghost is revealed as EXACTLY what you expected it was. It had so much going for it! I don't mind all of the coincidences and stuff, but I can't stand how telegraphed the twist is, 




 ***Introducing...Disney Nature's Bears 2!*** 




 Some people were disappointed there was no big conspiracy twist ending, and the one big twist only affected this self-contained tangent storyline that many people didn't care for - it only worked for those who wholly invested in the characters.    
Also, some felt betrayed that the answers to some mysteries were either too vague or didn't come up.    
All valid reasons. I loved the finale. Show went in a strange (arguably bad) direction for the final season, but largely redeemed itself with a super campy final episode paying tribute to its awesome characters.     
It all depends on whether you cared more about the characters or the mysteries. 




 Finale was episode 6.17. [The Titanic episode was 6.14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_SxoS-Gd_s), slightly before. 




 This is where I came from: The DHARMA Initiative...I was smart enough to not end up in that ditch, which makes me considerably smarter than you, John.    
*shoots Locke*  




 I honestly think that the director's cut kills the pacing entirely - bloats it to all hell, although the longer seminar scene was fantastic. 




 Controversial opinion: ***ALIEN***. Better pacing for a modern audience. Thank you, Ridley. 




 Nice work. Partly reminds me of The Dark Tower as well. 




 GoT is a mashup of several periods in the distant+not-so-distant past, made possible by setting it in an alt universe. I'd say it's comparable. 




 Yun-Jin Kim was incredible in much of seasons 4-6 of **LOST** (see 4.07 - Ji Yeon, 4.12-14 - There's No Place Like Home, 6.14 - The Candidate), but in Season 1...she had to pretend to be dramatically worse at speaking English than she actually was. Listening to her fake bad accent was like hearing somebody scratching a chalkboard. 




 Start ASAP and come back here after. Avoid spoilers 




 This season of the base show is really good. Cliff Curtis and Kim Dickens are good actors. Judging by the karma balance here, /r/television is in a pretty circlejerky mood today. 




 I kinda expected a colon in there somewhere.  




 Thanks! 




 underrated 




 The point of the film is that the anarchist message is clearly immature hypocritical bullshit and born out of misplaced masculinity. If you listen to what Tyler's plans are, his means are basically doing exactly what he condemns. 




 Secret epilogue?! 




 It *does* say #FantasticFour at the bottom, though. 




 Waaaaaaaaaalk into the jaws of hell... 




 Plot twist: he drugged her drink. 




 Hurley. Because he's the man, and he's fucking loaded. 




 In the hypothetical situation, he's supposed to be real. It's the whole point of the question.  




 Please tell me Josie's not your dog or something.

 Series Four will deal with Moriarty. 




 That's how I feel about the title track from Kid A. Fitter Happier, I can deal with - it's less than two minutes long and it absolutely elevates Electioneering.    
Fucking Kid A lasts five fucking draining, depressing minutes. Fitter Happier is a cakewalk compared to that piece of scheie. Kid A turns me into a shadow for the rest of the day. 




 The Christmas Special is only 9 months away. It's an Alt. version of Sherlock, with the same actors but set in the original Victorian time period of the novels. Currently filming. 




 There was once a "Who are some great female directors?" post that got very mildly popular. My comment was one of the top five, and I suggested *"Michelle MacLaren is a fantastic television director..."*    
    
A FEW MONTHS LATER, SHE'S PICKED TO DIRECT WONDER WOMAN. **WHERE'S MY CUT, WB?!**

 Fantastic cleavage, btw 




 In general, 'size', when referring to a measure of diversity, refers to population. 




 This is it. We aren't scared of bringing it up, we just don't wish to be be physically assaulted. 




 That's a top hat, though. 




 To be fair, I'm not from Europe, but it's a lot bigger population-wise than my nation. 




 Population-wise, rather large compared to many places. Tell me if Scots and Englanders sound similar, because they're both British nations. 




 Orange Is the New Black lifted the flashback structure straight from Lost. Tell him that. 




 Exactly.

 "British accent" Bitch, do you know how big Great fucking Britain is? How many fucking accents there are?    
(Edit: population-wise, people) 




 Sweet username! That theme kicks ass.

 Look at Winter's Tale, everyone. This is the guy that's writing The Dark Tower. 




 I totally see where you're coming from, but there's worse - like entire threads of comments and replies simply saying *Tom Cruise.*

 [Love Birds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1636539/). It's not fantastic, but it's all I can think of. 




 SHE'S NOT MY DAUGHTER. I STOLE HER AS A BABY FROM AN INSANE WOMAN. SHE'S A PAWN, NOTHING MORE. SHE MEANS **NOTHING** TO ME.    
The exact moment when Ben becomes sympathetic. 




 No Sanctuary (S5 premiere) was fantastic, though. 




 Not a pilot. 




 The only thing that I can get the hang of it and the rest of the day before I go to bed early tonight is going on with my friends are so cute when he said the government has been a long way toward the same time. 




 He's a weirdo-oh-oh.
