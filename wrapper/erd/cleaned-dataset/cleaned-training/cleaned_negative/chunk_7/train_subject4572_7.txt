 More posts and more exposure is a good thing. Even if it is a little annoying. 




 Hey, He stole [Jesus's](http://i.imgur.com/jAbfyib.jpg) sandals! 




 This looks like the most "funnest" place in the goddamned world! Just be responsible and not drown yourself...... God I miss the 80's. 




 The [bite](http://youtu.be/AtUXTEdLS4k?t=9s) for all who have not seen it. 




 No doubt. What an evil bitch!

 I was just thinking the same thing. Would it feel like rubber or cement. I'm not sure. 




 Crap! I shouldn't have use my real name! 




 Yeah... What is you is it you "say" Why little cat 




 Yeah, it's cool when your 18 but then you get AIDS. 




 Sinks in the ground... Trees that grow soap... I like this. And maybe an alcohol brook with LED TV bushes that run Adult Swim Programing. I need to sleep too, But Yay for Technatureolgy.

 There aren't Many sinks while hiking with your dad and brother in the Columbia Gorge... But yes I do wash my hands, and I was 11 and in the woods. And typically you wash your hands after peeing, not before.  




 Both my cats do this, I can go anywhere in the house and they don't follow me, but The bathroom, every time. It's like poop noises are like purring to them or something. 




 *Pus boil. Damn, I just realized what I typed. And Like pancake_gobbler said, I got it on my hands and went pee a few times before I realized I had it. 




 Yup! 




 NO NO NO! "THEY'RE CHASING TEDDY BEARS!!!" 




 Warner Brothers Hair monster did it [best](http://horrorpediadotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/gossamer-horrorpedia-1.png) 




 Oh dear, I giggled like a fat chick at a singles bar who received a moderate compliment. 




 He put the NSFW to fool us... Bravo you sadistic bastard, bravo. 




 I like the melted butter one.. "You would fat so!" Hey shut up! 




 I got it on my hands, face, arms and crotch when I was about 11. I got something like that pussy boil thingy on my forehead and it oozed and crusted my eyebrows while I slept. No fun at all, I don't envy your current situation friend. Good luck. 




 She is not allowed to drive them anymore. It's the day after and when it comes down to it a car is "just a thing" and she is a person, who fucked up albeit 3x in the last year, but still cars can be replaced and she cannot. 




 She has a good personality, she also feels extremely bad. We have been together almost 4 years now. And yes I told her she is not allowed to drive them anymore for my own reasons mainly and insurance reasons. And you're correct "petite and pretty" has nothing to do with it. The reason I said "petite and pretty" was to give my pissed off brain something good to picture instead of anger towards her. It was an accident but one that kills me a little inside. 




 You don't have enough upvotes for this. I was thinking the exact same thing. 




 This is fucked up, I'm surprised this isn't national news.... But alas they were all white so it's not national news worthy. 




 Did he died? 




 Hydrocephalus James Woods. 









 Here's a [twist](http://i.imgur.com/TN1wtXy.jpg). 




 I'm 32, I grew up off NE Portland Blvd (Rosa Parks Blvd now), way gang banger until Alberta turned into Hawthorne II about 10 years ago. Man times are a changin'. I can own a bike now. 




 Ha! 




 What also is cool is when someone links an Amazon.com link and you are logged in and it saves it in your Amazon search history and displays it down at the bottom like you were looking for weird shit. 




 I live in Portland, He took a bong rip and held it for the length of the tunnel. [Proof](http://treasure.diylol.com/uploads/post/image/494166/resized_bad-advice-cat-meme-generator-to-be-honest-i-m-lying-f44661.jpg) 




 Basic rule, spend what you can afford to lose, encrypt your wallet with a giant password, don't invest in currently available miners, and keep your tray table in the upright position during takeoff. It's a fun/scary trip to the moon friend, good luck. 




 Asshole! 




 Ya know... A little bit yes. 




 You are correct, he doesn't take a bitr. But he does eventually get a bite, you just have to keep watching. 




 [Oh you!](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CBKcdvPBrdM/T03sulC5avI/AAAAAAAAALE/2Q_fnIJKp6g/s1600/13267748908.jpg)
