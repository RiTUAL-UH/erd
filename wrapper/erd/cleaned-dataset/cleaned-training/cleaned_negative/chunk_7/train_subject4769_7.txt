 Accroding to Wikipedia, "The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues." 




 I, too, can't stop watching Vampire Diaries. The mythology is basically what keeps me interested. I refuse to watch The Originals purely because I dislike Klaus so hard. 




 Continuing on from this [prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3cet1u/wp_everyone_in_your_family_gets_one_wish_upon/csux8fk) (it isn't a direct continuation, as in this isn't the next scene; just merely another entry into the world of "The Unlucky Ones"):

Kimber retched over the side of the abandoned, musty couch, the only piece of furniture taking space in the empty warehouse. She heard the pitter-patter of rain hitting against the rust-covered window, and a slight, bitter wind blew in from the sole broken pane. Looking around, she felt the tiny fire Jonah made earlier in the night, before she fell asleep, fighting against the intense cold seeping in to the concrete-made facility. 

Her round eyes scanned the room looking for her uncle, but he wasn't anywhere to be found. She tried focusing on his signature to find him, like she had when she first called for him, but her stomach folded in two, causing her to cramp up into the fetal position. A fear burrowed deep into her conscious as she worried about her Turning, and then she remembered her dream.

'You are the last. He is the first.'

Her mother watched over her, somewhere across the globe, or maybe next door, Kimber didn't know and neither did Jonah. No matter the distance, she had gotten to Kimber through her dreams and warned her of the girl's fate. Despite their blood ties, her mother was determined to finish this out to the end, to the point of murdering her daughter, just as she had with her son.

After a few moments of meditation to help calm her nerves, Kimber sat up from her faux bed and searched around the expansive space for her uncle. Her eyes adjusted to the darkness beyond the fire, but she saw nothing. Fearing the pain in her gut, she relented using her *other* senses and stood up to go searching for him.

The warehouse looked different in the night, less inviting, almost suffocating despite how large it looked in the day. Her feet moved against the hard stone floor with an echo, and she turned in every direction to make sure nobody was watching or following her. God, how she hated feeling this useless and mundane, reduced to a whimpering child looking for her parents after a nightmare.

But she did have a nightmare. A vicious vision of her mother standing over her, hand raised high in the air holding an athame as Kimber felt frozen on the cliffs near the shore, on the same rock as the one her brother's corpse had been found lying on. "You are the last; he is the first," her mother warned, before plunging the athame down in the direction of her daughter's heart. 

What did she mean? Kimber didn't know.

Kimber stopped in the doorway leading outside, the same one Jonah bashed in to gain entry for the night. He stood out in the rain, with his hands in his overcoat pockets, contemplating. The intense rain didn't touch him, as if he wore an invisible barrier around his body. He looked up and their eyes met. Immediately, he understood it was time: *she* was coming. 




 Thanks. I hope to make something out of it. 




 I'd watch the HELL out of it. Honestly, it sounds like it'd do really well as a TV series (just my personal opinion). I'll keep on the look out, man.  




 Thanks. I actually borrowed the plot from an idea that has been brewing for the past 6 month - 1 year. It's called "The Unlucky Ones" and it's based on elements from my family life (quite complicated, but anyone in my family reading could see the connections). Anyway, originally, the idea was that the family is cursed to become magical after a horrific event happens in their life (something that leaves them changed deeply: loss, rape, suicide, etc) and they have incredible powers but they still cannot undo the horrific event in their lives and can only use their powers to help others be happy.  




 My birthday is actually August 8th, the birthday of the Sense8 crew! 




 Got a name for it yet? I want to make sure to pick it up, whether it's a book, comic, movie, tv show, whatever! 




 Kimber sat on the front steps of the school as she watched Uncle Jonah coming up the sidewalk wearing his trademark black, leather overcoat. He looked older, especially in his eyes, a fatique had taken over his usual, sunny smiling exterior from her childhood memories. She remembered his Turning, he had been so nervous about what to wish for, and Gram told him to stop focusing on the wish and prepare for the *change*.

Kimber's stomach cramped and she wondered if this is how it started, a simple tummy ache that would turn into the most intense pain ever felt in the world,  or at least that's how Jonah described it the day after his birthday.

"You'll know when it's happening," Jonah said reading her mind. He now stood at the bottom of the steps staring up at her, hands in his overcoat pockets. "How are you doing, love?"

She tried to smile, but it came out in a grimace. "Been a long time."

"Sorry, love," he said. He remained standing as he stared up at her. She wondered what he was thinking, but he made no indication in his body language.

"How's mum?" she asked.

He shrugged. "I hear about her from whispers on the wind." He paused as he looked at his grownup niece, taller than he remembered, a little rounder than before but beautiful with her long blond hair and bright blue eyes. This moment had waited too long. "I had expected to find her by now."

All she could do was nod as she looked down at her feet. She felt horrid, had all morning. She knew it was happening, her *conversion*, and she felt Jonah coming from across the globe. A few hours later, he stood in front of her despite all the years of no phone calls, no letters, no 'happy birthdays' or 'congratulations' for doing well in school, no presents for Christmas or Valentine's Day cards, just quiet.

She started to tremble as she felt the power growing inside of her. Her arms gathered around herself as she began to rock on the front steps.

"Let's get you out of her, love," he said. "Wouldn't want you to go through this on the front steps of your school."

She shook her head.

He could see the fear radiating off her. "Why not?"

"If I leave now," she said, her eyes opening and staring at him with an intense glare, "it means I leave this all behind. My **normal** life. The life without magic, wishes, an evil mother, a dead brother, and an uncle who promised he'd never leave me but disappeared a week later."

Jonah removed his hands from his pockets and walked up the stairs to sit next to her. He wrapped an arm around her body and she suddenly felt calmer. "I am sorry for walking out on you. I know you don't understand, but I had to, after your mother took Hunter and..." He couldn't finish the sentence. Kimber's memory went back to the day they found the boy's body on the cliff near the shore. Just turned 18 and completely lifeless. "She took his wish, sacrificed him for his power."

"Now she's hunting the others," Kimber said as she rested her head on her uncle's chest. She felt his heartbeat humming soothingly within. "She's gonna come for me."

Jonah nodded. "That's why I'm here. To protect you."

"I'm the bait," she said.

He shook his head and pulled her back. "No. If I wanted that, Kimber, I would've stayed and watched over you all these years. I didn't want it to take this long, but she's always been the master of evasiveness. I should've tried harder, but now you're in harm's way. I'm sorry."

A silence surrounded the two as the windy day blew from the East.

"We should go," he said standing up. He helped her to her feet. "I know you feel awful now, but you still have three days until your eighteenth. That's ample time to get things prepared, for both you and *your mother*."

Kimber followed Uncle Jonah down the steps at his side, all the way to the end of the sidewalk. She stopped and looked up at him. "You're going to have to kill her, won't you?"

Jonah looked her in the eye and said, "Yes, love." 




 Okay then:

**Mt. Djvul** is the largest mountain in all of Verhaal where the Eldric reside deep within the woods surrounding its base. It also happens to be the resting place of Ilke's heart, and home to the Kuomullinen.

**Elphaba the Witch** - After Redd and Gretel escape the Queen of Harts aka Red Queen, Redd is left in a feral state thanks to the vampiric Red Queen's blood magick. Luckily, Gretel knocks Redd out and drags her off into the nearby woods of Hart Kingdom where she finds the traveling merchant Merlyn and his apprentice Elphaba. As Merlyn helps pull Redd from Berserker mode, Elphaba shows Gretel a few tricks of magick which ends up having the Witch try to turn Robin the Blue Jay back into a human. Instead, she gives him an upgrade and turns him into a ferocious eagle.

After their first encounter, Redd takes Gretel across the lands to White Kingdom in hopes of raising an army to overthrow the Queen of Harts, but they'll need Merlyn's help to win. A year since their first encounter, Elphaba has become a powerful mage and she helps the Jaegers battle the Red Queen, but Merlyn ultimately dies during battle. Taking up the mantle of master, she takes Merlyn's magical book and helps take down the remaining army of Berserkers.

As the story continues, Elphaba trains under Glenda the Good Witch and ultimately becomes a host to a powerful spirit that slowly tries turning her into a Grimm by having her feed off the Noblest of Hearts, the Most Intelligent Brain, and the Essence of the Most Courageous Being. Thankfully, Gretel stops her and helps her rid her body of the demon. 

By the end of the series, Elphaba helps defeat Blackheart by summoning Etev to destroy the Wyrm controlled by the villain. 

Lastly, **the Fey** are beings connected to magick. They are your typical ideas of mythical fairy creatures: gnomes, nymphs, sprites, jinn, selkies, and more! These beings protect nature, live in it, thrive on it. They are closer to magick than Fehlen, though they aren't as powerful as the Unicorns, Draconians, or Eldric. Often, they become overprotective and they become mischievious when defending the woodlands.

 It's a great movie. You should check it out, man. 




 Oh wow. The more you learn. Thanks for letting me know. 




 I lived in Ohio when all the Affordable Healthcare Act stuff went down. So I was a neighbor for a while. But then when I returned to Oklahoma, as we passed through Indiana, we were pulled over (my friend from Oklahoma came to pick me up; packed her car full fo stuff; and headed out) and my friend got a ticket for speeding while I was cited for not wearing a belt. She hasn't paid her ticket to this day (3 years later) and she has crossed off Indiana as a state we can never visit again (like in the Simpsons).
