 banned for life, not only my smite account, but my Tribes account with 100$ spent on it 500 hours played and everything unlocked.  No warnings no review.  

I was accused of intentional feeding, and they banned solely on volume of reports, not merit. 




 How about the fact that these limits apply to things like chance of a rare material on salvages, punishing those of us who may save up a bunch of stuff to salvage at once. I learned my lesson when i saved 20 Yellows over maybe a 5 day period, I used a Mythic kit and got 13 ectos from 1-6 with only 1 have no ectos,  0 ectos 7-20 




 there is only one way.

The cow launcher.  Place your 50s bets and get ready!
