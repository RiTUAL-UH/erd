 Thank you for NOT including requim for a dream on this list!  Also watch Michael by Markus Schleinzer

 Thanks!  I was definitely in human form which explains the summonings.  That helps too with the tendency info, I'm going to go ahead and assume NG+ or more is in my future.. 




 Dark souls vet trying to wrap my head around this feature.  Also, the summoning is different too right?  I helped someone beat the Giant spider then ran back to help someone else and I couldn't use my summon blue or black.. 




 Listen to Catch 33 again.

 Meshuggah - catch 33    




 Sure!  Yea, I'm just aware of the cut items not why they were cut.  I really hope we get to interact with NPC's more in DS2....Would love to see cut scenes that show the NPCs story, like when you rescue Dusk and she's talking about how she got trapped, or with Rhea when she's talking about her 'companions'.

 Any of the knights in Anor Londo drop a good amount of souls....and the Lightning Zwei is good for everything!  Chaos Zwei is pretty brutal too...
