 This is a common missconception. The security lies in the pilots being told *to* fly into the tower, and the ATC's relying that the pilots training is completely shit. 




 Took me about a week i think. 




 This is exactly why I wish I trained Amarr first. 




 What is it then? On second look you're right, absolution is *a lot* shinier. 




 Absolution looks dank. 




 Glad burnout paradise made that list, love that game. 




 Probably be better off asking in the staff directly. 




 Small note, TorrentShack invite channel has been down for maintenance (AFAIK) for almost a week now.   




 Does it apply less or more stacking penalty than intended?

 What information do you collect for internal analytics? Is that information tied to the IP address you have that created the account?

 Probably? PROBABLY?!? You're fucking dead kid, i'm sending my tiger buddies round now. 




 Yeah I did, it's still under maintenance then. Cheers. 




 Am I doing something wrong or is TSh's invite irc channel still down? Heard it was under maintenance but that was like 4 days ago. 




 Your license is getting stale

Better throw it out OP, no one likes to eat stale licenses. 




 It means your account won't be shutdown/disabled/banned if you do not login for a long time.

 You can preface any statement with 'sudo' and they're contractually obligated to perform it. For example, I once had a tech come over and make me a turkey bacon sandwich. Definately one of the better sandwiches i've had. 




 Except he won't, because this didn't happen. 




 They're just messing with you dude. (sorry guys) 




 I have to say I agree with him. Your post comes off as one: making a very reasonable point about respecting other peoples opinion, which 99% of rational people will agree with. Two: arguing against minors being able to deny potentially life saving treatment, which is without a doubt a much more controversial opinion. The first is generally agreed upon by all rational people, and the second is up for debate until the world explodes.

It's also one that both me and him (and the votes) agree detracts very much from your first point.

I personally see your first point only being made because of your second point, i.e., although I can appriciate how the first point is unrelated and still relevant. 




 Unintentionally deep title? 




 Yeah I think it means link to profile pages. 




 huehuehuehue 




 Excellent job dodging the question, and 'enhancing the discussion'. Don't expect a reply unless you can actually support the existence of this imaginery myth. 




 Okay, so say they don't google it. Where exactly do they hear this myth? The only reason i'm still replying is because I don't think you can find a popular website where people don't completely disagree the second that's posted, educating anybody reading it. 




 I mean, you keep claiming it's a myth, but 9/10 results on google say otherwise (http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Are+private+tracker+safe%3F). As well as anyone that's done 1 minute research on the subject. You haven't even posted a link or a screenshot of anyone saying that, and people agreeing with them. 

Edit:  here's an article by the largest copyright and privacy website where they analyse the OP: https://torrentfreak.com/are-private-bittorrent-trackers-safe/ The only myth here is the one you're inventing, it's pretty hilarious you can't see that. 




 You agree with 99% of rational people that use private trackers. This is the most pointless thread i've read in a long while. Congratulations. 




 RIP 




 Having recruitment threads on trackers that require you to get to a higher user level (e.g. elite) is a pretty good incentive. Other than that, free invites and immunity from getting disabled for being away is pretty nice. 




 Took me way too long to notice it was the same person.

 Ah thats cool, I can understand that then.  




 Nice video.. Why they stayed in t1 ships when they saw you were rekting them no one will kniow.  




 It's fine, I saw on an API key that they got an alliance mail telling them to delete them.

Wait a second... 




 You could just buy him a PLEX and give him the Activation Code they give you. AFAIK Amazon might ask you for an account name, but places like http://store.markeedragon.com/?cat=4 and https://www.g2a.com/ (make sure you use G2A shield) are trusted, and they both should give you an Activation Code. 




 Yes. Yes they can. People don't because they prefer not to be in jail. 




 You could have done so much more with that title OP. You failed us damnit. 




 Becuase they have to make other people feel bad to make themselves feel good. Welcome to reddit, where the circlejerk is too real. 




 Not a title I thought i'd ever see. Did BRAVE stop PL from dropping supers?

 Get your head out of your arse. Not everyone is a native english speaker, and not everyone has good linguistic skills. Assuming so makes you look like an asshole, and rightly so. 




 Not everyone is a native english speaker, or even if they are, have you ever heard of dyslexia? Sometimes I forget how much reddit can be arrogant douchebags. Thank you for reminding me. 




 RIP Santa. 




 Read what I said in the very next sentence: Anyone that hears the -bro terms being used in context enough knows that to be true. 

If you go to assumptions the first few times you hear something said, in a community you're completely new to, then it's not the communitys fault. 




 lmao b8/8 




 I racially identify as a helicopter, can I still join? 




 You're *really* reading too much into it. I think in the context that -bro is used in EvE it seems like a more blanket term, that isn't meant to include gender politics, but is used to connate a role that attracts friendship. It's not implied that your female or male, because no one actually knows what you are behind the screen. Anyone using the term like that does not represent the majority, and their defenition should not be taken as fact.

Personally i've only ever heard of logibro (when a logi saves someones ship) and newbros (because the game needs new players to survive) being used widely. Wormbro is a name of a corporation, and not something that fits the majority of the -bros. 

It's not hard to get around the perception of exclusion, because there is none! Anyone that hears the -bro terms being used in context enough knows that to be true.

For some context i've been playing for about a year, and have been in large-very large corps for the majority of that time (so it's not like I play market pvp 24/7 in my 0% tax corp). 




 Did they set the drives on fire to test them!? Also you can be damn skippy those workers don't take as much care when the cameras not on them.

 All those industrial ships. I automatically assume if I read/hear a ship name i've don't know its an industrial. Works 99% of the time.

 Nope, they're still up for me 




 Widow because fuck yeah ECM bonus'. 




 From what I understand of it, the code in the second picture shows the app downloading something silently, and encrypting and sending usage statistics of the user to Viber. This shows a blatent lack of respect for their users privacy. 









 Almost forgot. Why would you ever trust battleclinic for a 1.9bn fit? Some of their fits are really really bad.  Please say you cross checked the fit with a trust corp mate or smth like that. 

That 4th BCU gives you 300dps increase vs 30k EHP with a DCU. Is that really worth? 




 Assuming there was no such thing as eve-survival, wouldn't you just warp in, not bastion, align out, and warp if you can't tank it? Or do the frigates reach you too fast?

If there wasn't anything like eve-survival, people would just setup a channel and do it that way instead. And you would still have probably died because you wouldn't have read the comments there. Or even if the guide was made by CCP, can you honestly say you would have read the comments?

Seems like you're trying to blame this on the game, when it was pilot error plain and simple.
 




 Even if he is 'biased', which any opinion is by the way (at least by your defenition) his point still stands, they were obviously looking to make the cops look bad on camera. Stating that he's biased dosen't even begin to refute his point, and just makes it looks like you can't. 









 From what i've heard all the races are equal (or one might be a tiny bit better) so train what you think looks cool. And AFAIK you can use both torps and bombs.

 I'm curious, do you put ECM on that?

 Take my advice with a grain of salt, as i'm not a wormholer.

1. Probably not. It can be scanned down by multiple peole 

2. You're in a wormhole system, it's not on the world map because it can only be accessed through scanning it down, not throguh stargates.

3. They're selling the loot they get from the sites, and I think people do sell wormholes too if they're empty and valuble. 




 Nevermind, I missread the article. Where the hell does she even hide 200$ worth of items?!? 




 Aww yeah bby, Widow represent. 




 Nicely done, some drop shadow would make it look nice IMO. 




 I've played with the worst of players in League of Legends, this is much much worse, simply because people can completely destroy your EvE experience, and you cant just leave a game like you can in League and forget about it. 

The 'bonus room' was a 'service' created by a scammer. Once he scammed someone he would have them go into his teamspeak and make them degrade themselves IRL, or completely devalue their character (imagine making someone lose rating from diamond to bronze), just so they could get their assetts and money back (he still wouldn't give it back 9/10 times). He and his buddies were eventually permanently banned from EvE. 
http://jestertrek.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/the-bonus-round.html

There really isn't any permanence of meeting a troll in league, apart from maybe losing some rating and 40 minutes of your time. In EvE, the scumbags can kill your ship which you've spent actual days farming for. To be fair, if you're smart about it you probably will only be scammed once, it's the people who are ignorant of what's encouraged (scamming) that get bit the worst. 




 Link? 




 Esteemed community

Eve brings out the worst and the best in people. I have met the most vile people on EvE, that I wouldn't dream of finding anywhere else.
