 I will, if possible  




 Great! waiting for your new movie and good luck :) 




 Haha, so will you choose to watch it again if you get any chance?  




 Yeah, word of mouth can make every movie successful. 




 Does this mean we have no more 007 series? What a pity! 




 I see~ So have you ever thought of the things about your second movie?  









 Why did you choose Suspicion to be your Directorial Debut? I mean you must have had some choices and why you finally chose Suspicion?  




 But creating heroes in the movie doesn't mean creating the heroes in our real life. In my opinion, in order to fulfill people's desire of heroes we need to make our nation stronger.  




 I can't agree more. And this kind of films are popular outside America, which enlarge the market and gives the film maker more profit to make. But now I want to know what things they will make into hero in the future. So far we have iron, spider and so many things. It seems that children and boys are more addicted to this kind of films.  




 Yes, so I mean there won't be so many women who want a guy at their father's age to be their boyfriend.  




 Haha, the monster on the cover is very cute.  




 Ant-Man has arouse heated discussion recently but I haven't seen it. Do you think it worth watching? I am thinking about finding a time to watch it with my friends.  









 16 maybe
