 This was over two years ago and from recollection both drivers survived with minimal injuries.  




 To thank it for allowing me to control the direction of my car.  




 Though often misunderstood to refer only to insecticides, the term pesticide also applies to herbicides, fungicides, and various other substances used to control pests.

 This is your best one yet.  




 Probably that 11:00 is when people are going off to sleep? Or maybe it's when we all discuss our plans for world domination.

 So were is my paycheck? 




 They also keep claiming Roundup is 100% safe for human consumption and the environment, because Glyphosate[1] is very toxic to non-human entities. Our environment is just as important.

  
No one is claiming it's safe for human consumption, what is claimed is that it is safe when used as directed. [In terms of herbicides glyphosate is one of the least harmful ones to non-target organisms and soil health.](http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/pdfs/factsheets/soc/tech/glyphosa.pdf)
  
[Also glyphosate tolerant crops have allowed farmers to use more non-tillage farming practices in order to preserve soil health.](http://grist.org/food/soil-proprietor-do-gmos-promote-dirt-conservation/)
  
They also are the original developer's of Agent Orange (now banned, but you see where the stream goes.)

  
No they are not, they were one of many producers of the chemical under orders of the US government. 
  
Bill Nye, though not a "GMO scientist" has done the basic math and found that USA doesn't "need" GMO's
  
[Actually Bill Nye changed his mind after actually researching and learning about GMOs.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/03/proof-hes-the-science-guy-bill-nye-is-changing-his-mind-about-gmos/)
  
so why does Monsanto keep pushing it here? Other countries that DO need it aren't getting enough of it.
  
There has been a push for GMOs in many countries from India to the Philippines and in all instances it has shown to be a plus to local farmers from increase yields to decrease pesticide exposure. The issue is that GMOs have unfortunately become a political talking point and many countries that could gain from their use have decided to ban and halt their use. 
  
 




 Of course, if someone has a different opinion they must be a shill.  




 MS should have released both Halo 5   6 day 1, it's a joke that we have to wait so long!

 Most likely it was caught early so surgery was all that was required.

 This test wasn't done by Top Gear, but yeah I'm sure Ferrari isn't too happy.  




 GMOs are not poison, this is no better than the anti-vac movement.  




 Do you have to have the disk in to play?
  
Most likely, the disk will be used as an authentication key.  




 The 360 emulated original xbox games but not all ran so well and some where unplayable.  




 Both the X360   PS3 used different hardware architecture then the current gen. 




 You have to download the game, but it's free if you use a 360 copy.  




 Or maybe they will use a pesticide that costs a little more with just as much saftey testing but has less damaging effect on the environment and doesn't give their customers cancer.
  
What one? And there is little evidence that glyphosate is actually causing cancer in humans.
  
  
 IARC's findings are not a risk assessment, they didn't look at the actual risk of getting cancer from glyphosate exposure. Their classification and findings are based off if they believe it can from the available evidence. A chemical could cause cancer in 1:1billion people or 1:10 people and they can be classified under the same group.
  
When you look at human and animal studies the risk of glyphosate is overblown even among high risk groups such as applicators.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related to glyphosate treatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations between glyphosate and cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion that glyphosate does not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 I saw Fallout 4, nothing else matters.  




 Of note the IARC's report was not a risk assessment, they didn't look at the actual risk of getting cancer from glyphosate exposure for their classification. A chemical could cause cancer in 1:1billion or 1:10 and they can be classified under the same group.

 It was more then just several scientist sending letters, virtually every major health and safety department from Europe to Brazil wrote up a report highlighting all the faults and errors in the original 2012 study.  




 We'll Meet Again - Vera Lynn 




 You wanted to read about said problems in a re-analysis of their findings. 
  
Remember?
  
And I hope to read about these problems in a re-analysis of their findings in the scientific literature!
  
So I provided links to several re-analysis by top health and safety assessment groups. 

 




 Here are some analysis of the 2012 study and its short falls.
  
[Here is the original EFSA report that highlighted short comings and error in the 2012 Seralini study.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986.htm)   
  
  
EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)  
  
  
Based on Health Canada and CFIAs review of this information [the Seralini study], the authors conclusions concerning the long term safety of NK603 corn and glyphosate are not supported
  
[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn  


[Brazil National Biosafety Technical Commission](http://www.cibiogem.gob.mx/Sala-prensa/Documents/CTNBIO-Brasil-Seralini1725.pdf)

[Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council report](http://www.bio-council.be/docs/BAC_2012_0898_CONSOLIDE.pdf)  
  
  
Here is a great quote on their opinion on Seralini 2012  
  
It should never have been accepted for publication in a scientific journal. The process of peer review which is usual before acceptance for publication in scientific journals has clearly failed here.

[High Council of Biotechnolgies conclusion.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)
  

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation. 

[ANSES Opinion](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the studys authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research.

 The EPA is currently re-evaluating its classification of glyphosate with regards to recent findings for example
  
Kind of, the EPA is going to take into account IARCs findings but the current review isn't due to the IARCs findings. 




 I wish I was paid to browse and post on reddit, but alas I'm not. 




 So you don't have any quantifiable evidence that the sources I've linked to are falsified? 




 They are paid to do this! and we are here because we stumbled upon this thread and want to discuss it, or read how other people wanna interpret it.
  
[Citation Needed] 




 They do such as Bt-crops. Glyphosate is a herbicide and so it kills plants not insects. 




 Because they are a simplified model and shouldn't be used as the sole evidence for determining if something poses a significant risk in humans, especially when you have animal studies along with human studies to draw from.  




 Of the studies that I have linked to what ones are falsified or have been disproven by more recent research? 




 No one.  




 Cell cultures are not the only way to asses toxicity.  




 Yes, it does, but it classifies glyphosate as probably carcinogenic which is a completely different category.

  
They are not completely different categories as they are merely in different subcategories of Group 2 classification.   




 In cell cultures.  




 The organization is mentioned in the article and is the reason for the current ban.  




 The same group (IARC) classifies cellphones as possibly carcinogens. 
  
  There is plenty of evidence supporting the relative safety of glyphosate to humans.

Also GWPharma Sativex is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials in the US for pain management in cancer patients and Epidiolex is undergoing trails in the US for treatment of epilepsy in children.
  
So even in the US millions of dollars are being spent to get a cannabis derived drug to market.

 Again, a single anecdotal account is hardly evidence.  




 There's a clinical trial going on right now in the U.S. looking at its effectiveness with treating seizures in children. 




 I was always asking for strong clinical controlled studies proving mmj effectiveness, the same threshold required for all drugs.  




 The issue with the current research on seizures is that the studies are small and not controlled. Which is fine for supporting further research, but not proving efficacy. 




 None of those are control clinical studies.  




 Maybe you wont because there are very few studies showing efficacy of mmj.  




 What studies? Please provide links to controlled clinical data showing cannabis effectiveness curing or treating disease/illness.  




 Anecdotal accounts are hardly compelling evidence.  




 Are these controlled   blinded studies you are referring to? If so I would like a link.  




 America is not the world. 




 Ferrari doesn't actually have a team that competes at Le Mans.  




 Unfortunately as long as Ferrari believes F1 is the only important racing series we won't see a Ferrari Ford rivalry unless Ford enters F1. 




 But the evidence that mmj is actually having a positive effect on reducing seizures is weak/lacking.  




 A lot of shit has been used for thousands of years, but that isn't proof that it is an effective medical treatment.  




 They can still gain exclusivity on it.  




 Except there is no Ferrari team at Le Mans 




 I noticed the Ferrari reference, but I wonder if Ford knows that Ferrari doesn't actually have a factory team at Le Mans anymore.  









 The Tesla is fast, except around a track. 




 Canada doesn't allow research into cannabis?  




 Because it's easier to just repurpose a V8 from an existing car.  




 The issue with mmj is that for most illness/disease it lacks strong empirical evidence proving its effectiveness.  




 After seeing a few in person god that car is beautiful.  




 Because a gas car can do it in under 29hrs.  




 USDA does allow trace amounts of GMO contaminates in Organic crops to remove/minimize this risk.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 He already had a [case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cariou_v._Prince) that he won over making very minor transformations to photos by a different photographer. I'd be shocked if the courts classify his work as copyright infringement.  




 You either have the creative urge or you don't. 
  
So it's the "urge" that make it art? So if Richard Prince had the "urge" to take comment and take photos off instagram then he's an artist right? Cause he had the "urger" right? So if someone who paints or takes photos purely to make money like a wedding photographer or a portrait painter then cause they lack the "urger" they are not true artist?  
  
So to reiterate, this crappy excuse of art is just some guy downloading other people's work, making insignificant changes that change absolutely nothing about the main focus of the piece
  
Why are they insignificant changes and how is the main focus unchanged?
  
nor that he only just doesn't violate copyright
  
Is he actually violating copyright? How is this work not protected under fair use as appropriation art? 
  
That'd be like me taking a photo of the Mona Lisa and putting a caption on it, and trying to act like I did something artistic.
  
Well by your reasoning if you had the "urge" wouldn't it be art? 
  
There's better "art" than this dude's in /r/photoshopbattles[1] .
  
Wait, is making art a competition? Is only good art "art"? What makes something good? And who decides this?  




 Hardware stores and the like, acid has many uses such as cleaning. Even in the states buying high concentration acid is relatively easy.  




 So if he took the pictures himself would his work still be an "embarrassment to art"? 




 He's not stealing, what he is doing is protected under fair use as transformative art.  




 This is a myth.
  


[Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png) 
  
  
[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.  


[Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)
  

  
  
[And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)
 
The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

  
  
Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India.

 They're just photos he stole off instagram. With a ridiculous price tag. It's laughable.
  
It's hard to take you serious when you don't even know what you are hating on. The work that Richard Prince created was not merely "photos off instagram".  




 Are you saying that I just have to understand the process to be an artist?  




 So that's the F-35? No wonder everyone is pissed about it, damn thing can barely fly.  




 It's probably not the last Enzo produced, Ferrari has a habit of making more then they claim. IIRC there are actually about 450 produced Enzos out there.
