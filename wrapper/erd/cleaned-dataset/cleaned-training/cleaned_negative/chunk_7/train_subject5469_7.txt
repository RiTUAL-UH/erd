 [Overflow from Tahoe into the Truckee river.](http://www.truckeeriverkeepers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Truckee-Tahoe-boca-900x600.jpg) Normally it is up around those tree banks.

Probably want to get out there soon. The two tributary rivers behind my house that feed Tahoe should be about 4ft deep right now. They are about a foot deep at most. That much because we got some rain this month.

edit: site with more info http://www.truckeeriverkeepers.com 




 They must have gotten permission to dredge. Last I heard the coast guard grounded her due to shallow water after she was stuck on the sand bar. I am glad you had a good time. 




 Bit more than that:

 East coasters [need to see this](https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU)- the reason behind these stuck weather patterns. 




 Tahoe is so low it is no longer feeding the Truckee river and snowpack was officially 0 this year. They have had to dry dock the tourist boats because the water level is too low to get to dock. 

The water is really algae-murky too near the shoreline. It's a complete mess. 




 The overflow from Lake Tahoe into the Truckee river- which feeds tributaries to this- hasn't been flowing for a year and a half - Tahoes water level is too low. Add 0 (zero) snowpack this season and Nevada is cooked.

Such a shame - this area of the sierra foothills was so beautiful. I wonder how the tribes are handling it. 




 You never explored the unfinished map of the Emerald Dream. It's amazing. And no - not all green. Giant plants and flowers though. 




 If I were a teacher forced to teach creationism I would include major creationism stories from around the world, including the Aztec, Navajo, Babylonian, Sumerian, Dogon, Chinese   Indian creationism stories, with an emphasis on similarities. I would be sure to give them all equal weight and measure.  









 I just figured he had a bunch of virgins in the basement, eating vegan and running treadmills till he needed another one. 




 Some people are just too mean to die. 




 What I meant was that fennel and kohlrabi have an allelochemical defense mechanism against peppers and they don't do well when grown near each other. 




 That ain't Jesus calling him...and why he's afraid to die. 




 Yes I have noticed for the past two summers there is a preponderance of it in those states. 




 What are they planted near? Don't plant peppers near fennel or kohlrabi.

I  would dig a little natural compost in around, make sure they have good drainage and just give them some time. You might want to try a little epsom salts (half teaspoon per gallon of warm water) and water them once a week for a couple weeks with that. 

Be careful with nitrogenous fertilizers though. If you over fertilize peppers with nitrogen they will get lush leaves and no fruit. You might want to try a dry vegetable mix fertilizer at half recommended dosage. Make sure to get a fertilizer with usable iron and sulfur. 




 I live near the mountains now and we have wild ones. But I did grow hybrids in my rock garden (in the midwest) with alstroemeria, dog-tooth violets, lady slipper, yellow and purple dwarf siberian irises, johnny jump ups around the base of them -and purple and yellow columbine.

I loved that garden. 




 Spinach always grew like crazy in my raised bed. (I let my chickens bed on it for half the winter and tossed wood ash from winters fireplace in it) I learned to toss it into darn near everything. Scrambled eggs? Go grab a couple double handfuls to toss in. Fried Rice? Same. And every single slow cooker meal. It especially goes well with pork dishes. 




 I had some morning glories come in through my kitchen window from a trellis of it in my annual bed. I loved the sunlight shining through the petals in the morning. 




 Bright Angel Point? 






















































 And this shits safe to drink, huh? Unless you are a plant.  









 And just try posting anything that could possibly be perceived as even 7th generation criticism of Warcraft or Blizzard on /r/wow. It's blatantly obvious that it is corporate controlled at this point. I was shocked at some of the very mild statements that I and others have made lately that were dv to death. 

It's not a circle-jerk as much as a dick sucking contest.  









 GD?

Edit: Ok I had my coffee. Got it.  




 I started noticing an anti-female 'anti-feminist' astroturfing campaign about 8 months ago. I'm in marketing. 

So about 2 months ago an old colleague contacted me about references. I asked him what he had been doing and he said he had been doing PR postings for the Republican party under a media group contract. I asked him why he left and he said it was because it had been turned into a *'Woman hatred, feminist hatred, made up stories fest 24/7"* in "prepping" for a Hillary run. He said they were even posting as rabid, crazy people claiming to be 'feminists' to make them look bad.

He quit when met someone and fell in love, and realized that he was posting, ultimately, about her, and his mother, and his sisters. 

A lot of people fall for slick 'advertising' - even redditors. Usually a clue is when all of a sudden you notice a clear trend popping up.  




 All of the achieves in Draenor includes:

Mythic Draenor Raider

Complete the Mythic raiding achievements listed below.
Mythic: Gruul Mythic: Oregorger Mythic: Hans'gar and Franzok Mythic: Beastlord Darmac Mythic: Flamebender Ka'graz Mythic: Operator Thogar Mythic: Blast Furnace Mythic: Kromog Mythic: Iron Maidens Mythic: Blackhand's Crucible Mythic: Kargath Bladefist Mythic: The Butcher Mythic: Tectus Mythic: Brackenspore Mythic: Twin Ogron Mythic: Ko'ragh Mythic: Imperator's Fall 




 Me too. I guess I will go sign up again. Still not thrilled with the garrison thing- but it at least shows someone was listening. Or maybe the numbers were beating them over the head. 




 Economic, social and technological.

Warning: long.

People pretty much stayed in the same places. My great grandmothers home was built by her father in 1920. She lived there until a few weeks before she died in 1983- when my grandmother cared for her in the house *they* bought in 1958. 

There were long term familial and neighborly support structures in place. People knew each other, and helped each other. The routine in the evenings was to go sit on the porch after supper and people who were out walking would stop and visit, and tell stories and talk politics or whatever. If you had a big porch like my great gran you had a few pitchers of cold tea ready. Same people, same faces, going back to the depression/war era.

Part of the reason for porch sitting or taking walks was to see people, part of the reason was AC wasn't common back then and it was nice to cool off in the evenings outside.

The generation of people older than me by 8-10 years; when they graduated college and got jobs, companies started moving people across the country. That was the beginning of the breakdown of the support system.

When I graduated HS I worked at a local pet shop for a few months, then got my own place. A very nice little rental that was comfortably paid for with one weeks check. There were no 'credit checks' back then- it was inconceivable that you could not afford a place to live with even the humblest of jobs. I was able to go to college part time and save back for the downpayment on my first house.

In the 2000's, when an artificial economy was built on the housing 'market' - driven by higher and higher property values (how are you going to *grow* an economy on stable values?) suddenly people couldn't afford to purchase homes, hell they could barely afford rent.

This also means that people move around a lot. More social breakdown, combined with technology that keeps people entertained in their artificial environments. And people having to work more than one job at a time that leaves little room for socializing with neighbors struggling to do the same.

 And here we are today. 

When I see pictures or google maps pics of European cities in which there are a lot of folks out and about, socializing, I know they are doing well. It's a thumbstick measure I have internalized. 




 My guild killed a lot of bosses over time. A lot of those moments were memorable. [We were always doing stupid, fun, wild stuff, from vanilla right through MOP.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/11499710@N00/)

But about epics, I'll put it like this: 

What if you were Indiana Jones and went on an adventure, endured some grueling moments, challenged fate, monsters, your skills and the elements and finally emerged victorious with a glorious, magical ring.

So you go back to town ... and half the people are walking around with the same ring, having barely done a thing to achieve it.

First off, there is definitely not the same sense of achievement and pleasure for the people who didn't leave town or even break a sweat to get the ring. The excitement and joy would be diminished. Ho hum, just another bit of gear.

Secondly, Indy would just be like.. fuuck. 




 I didn't unsub because of the hunter issue. My unsub was in protest of this xpac. I have 3 100's. One at 675 so it is not like I didn't give it a good shot. 

We paid 20% more and waited 14+ months for an expansion that removed more playable / fun content from the game than it has added:

1. Flying

2. Reforging + Item Upgrades

3. Scenarios

4. Character Abilities

5. Valor/Justice Points

6. Daily quest hubs

7. 10 Heroic ('Mythic') Raiding

8. Guild levelling/perks

9. Repeatable rare mobs

10. Gathering professions for over half a year and counting

11. All old school unique professions scrapped in all future 'content'.

12. Decent ilvl gear from world bosses (650?)

13. Previous expansions' content scrapped: MoP legendary questline, Garrosh heirlooms, Isle of Thunder solo scenarios, MoP challenge mode content, old raid item drop nerfs

14. "Promised"/Delayed content:

Farahlon

Karabor/BladespireIron Docks quest hub

Tanaan Jungle

Trial of the Gladiator

Battle Pet Breeding/Epic Pets

Multiple garrison features: the ability to put your garrison is various locations, renaming your epic followers, garrison Trophies for killing rares/elite mobs in Draenor, Building Garrison Defences, Diablo 3-style transmog system 

------------------------------------

 Not sure how anyone can reconcile this. Never in the history of WoW have so many features been removed or scrapped. 




 As a child of the '60's I can tell you that people were out more and interacting. In neighborhoods and city streets. I watched that change and have some theories on it. 




 Aunt Thomasina. 




 Ok get the other one. We can still dual wield. Get the glowing green feathered shoulders and the green mail robe and gloves (LW pattern) and hang out in your main city - with a green pet. :) 




 Yes, it took two mini patches. Thanks! 




 See http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3995xq/new_to_this_game/ 




 I think the writer is full of shit. I have known two black players on the game - one of whom was my exclusive running buddy for the past 8 months. Well past the time we hit 100 we used to pop in and do LFD to help strangers get their Leeroy. My friend? He would have said something if he sensed any racism about it. He thought it was funny as hell.

 




 My raider in vanilla was my pally, mage for bc / wrath (hunter was pvp) then I reversed that with hunter and mage for cata. MOP Hunter/pally raiding. 

I decided to focus 100% on the hunter last half of MOP and started her first in WoD, not knowing that they would fuck the Beast spec so badly that a dev even apologized on twitter and did an early mini patch to try to help fix them.  




 My point being, if I have a minimum range limit with the bow then I need to effectively melee. That means proper weaps- ability. AP used to be the go-to stat.  




 The hunter dead zone is impossible in several encounters in dungeons or raids. But if we got our unique pet abilities back and were allowed to melee and dual wield again, it would be fun in pvp. 

I played with that 'dead zone' for a long time on my hunter. It just can't be done without bringing the other elements back, including proper traps instead of the bullshit we have now. 

Edit: about my first sentence there. Here is an example: The [End Time in Cata](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugSVZK-k4PM/maxresdefault.jpg). You had to be within the circle of lights on the encounters, remember? If you were within those- as you needed to be - you were too close range to shoot the boss.  If you stepped back to where you were at closest range to shoot- you were outside the light and only did about 10% to 20% damage. 

It was like an Anti Hunter encounter.  




 I absolutely agree with everything you said. Not only have they made classes homogenous- they did the same thing with hunter pets.

One of the Fun things about having a hunter was going out and getting elusive pets that had unique abilities (like horn toss for rhinos or snatch (disarm) for birds etc). These abilities were then useful for different encounters, battlegrounds, enemies, etc. It was part of being a well-rounded hunter. 

Now all the pets are just buff machines for the raid.  

Give me those pet abilities back- plus the hunter melee abilities we used to be able to use, including dual wielding for close encounters (I still have my Edge of Chaos and Sundered Bone axe in the bank) and full-on aggressive mode for pets- and I will gladly give up my several yards.

I used to love parking my cat at flags - on aggressive and prowl (stealthed with burst damage coming out) and watch it pop out -stunning the crap out of the would-be flag stealer and wrecking them while I threw traps and arcane shot. Yea, I'll give up my close up yards for that. But I don't think you would like it. 




 As a player with a 100 druid healer- I applaud you for posting this.  




 I'm hostile about it because it's the first time since I started playing that - for any toon - the ability imbalance forced me to play a spec I never wanted to play. It lost the element of fun. Same thing that many others are complaining about. 

I am pissed because Blizzard, to my mind, has ruined the game to the point where I had to unsub to protest after 10 yrs consistent subbing. I even kept my sub through business trips overseas and hiatuses when I couldn't play at all or took a break for a few months.

They decided to chase a trend of social network/Facebook style games instead of sticking to the formula everyone loved.

It's like Paul Sams (former COO Blizzard) said in his first interview this week after leaving Blizzard:

**Paul Sams**: 

First and foremost, *I learned that you must put game quality and player experience first in everything that you do.* Gamers are not driven to buy games because they have a clever business model, they buy games that are *fun and immersive that deliver on what was promised.* I also learned that being a trend chaser or first mover is not a key to victory. 

*Force feeding a development team to chase a business model or game type trend* when the team doesn't love it is a likely losing proposition. A happy and motivated team that is making a game that they absolutely love *with a leadership team that doesn't force them to ship their game before it is ready is part of that formula for success.* 




 We used to co-raid with Conquest, Kilrogg. They had a kid in there like that. Awesome player and everyone would think he was a 30 yr old raider .. until he got on vent.  




 Nice attitude there Chuck. 

Maybe you think people should just get a whole suit of epics simply for buying the game? 

Part of what is wrong with the game now is the loss of a sense of accomplishment that comes from spending time excelling and focusing on a task, then succeeding. Those are the memories that stand out and make you smile. 




 I unsubbed this week for the first time in 10 yrs. I have always, until now, been able to play how I wanted. I won't play again until blizzard gets us back to the WORLD of Warcraft instead of the Facebook/UI/game WoD turned it into. 




 Old school trick. For the first trip to Menethil from IF we used to jump off of one spot on the dam at Loch Modan. It was a death leap but if you did it right you would end up at the GY at Menethil. Bingo flight path. Saved the run past those damn spiders, which killed you anyway, most likely.  




 So I am in a WoD dungeon the first time. My Hunter - I have been playing and raiding with her since July 05. 

We get in there - first pull on a group mob- all is clear behind them.. I set my pet on the target - pet hits the target. Then I use Barrage- same main target ...and the ammo is going *through my body* to hit a mob that is across the room behind me. I swear to fucking christ if the DL hadn't seen it himself and started laughing and freaking out I probably would have been kicked. 

Next area. My pet and the Lock pet both start going crazy in the room- like they are stuck on these paths like a tram on rails and going a hundred miles an hour. 

Fuck me if we didn't pull every damn thing there. Thankfully we were with old school experienced players that knew stuff was bugging out.  




  level ranks gone, and fuck buying spells.

I really loved level ranks for spells. For example with a pvp mage I kept lvl 1 or 2 Blizzard and Arcane Nova keybound and could constantly pop around or blizzard areas to uncover stealthed enemies and only use tiny amounts of mana. Also, if a lower level wanted mana/health food I could make that for them. I can't do that now. 

There were benefits to all of my toons to be able to access lower level spells/abilities.  




 All hybrids. I loved my shockadin.  




 Seriously? But.. cheetahs are the cat that does go supersonic- so that makes absolutely.. oh yea.  




 I think the Deer travel form art and animation is some of the best done in the game. Someone studied deer/elk.  




 My bear ass still looks like a pointy pentagon. 




 Hunter

Lore: Cry havoc and unleash the Stampede of war.

Player: Fucking Blizzard, making me go Marks when I been playing Beast for 9 years. 

How I felt throughout Highmaul. 




 Should have played Vanilla Pally. https://www.flickr.com/photos/11499710@N00/8704746307/in/photostream/ 




 No dude. Tanking Wars were worse than worthless in tm vs ss. 




 Fucking brilliant, praise Uther! 




 Not only legendaries- but it used to be getting a purple was a big deal. Now there are low lvl new people running around decked in purps. I will never forget the first one that I got - at lvl 60 in Vanilla MC. 




 As an economist once said, "Both a poor man and a rich man can choose which bridge to sleep under." 




 That's the one I was considering. Especially if she has psychically picked up on Jons true parentage. 




 I don't know, man. She is so evil- I had a suspicion that she is possibly doing all she can to eradicate the Baratheons. We will see. 




 Weird. I have adblock on and got no message. If I had I would not have posted that particular video. I'm sorry bout that. 




 I thought I was the only one that tried to use google to see if I could locate a place and see what's still there. Howdy!

Amazing how bustling and busy everything looked back in the day. Streets look positively empty now. 




 Same for some of us women. I need quiet like a polar bear needs ice. The hubby can never take a clue on that it seems. I think this is more a 'human' issue than male/female. 




 Yes but we don't leave our hand in our bra, cupping our boob, for upwards of 30 minutes - heh. 




 I taught a class on Nostradamus. I taught them that this 'sept' did not mean "7th month", that was a crock. 

Also, when calculating the difference between the calendar of Nostradamus day and ours - 1999 would actually be 2001. "King of the Mongols'' is also wrong.

I taught this class in the mid-1990's. 

L'an mil neuf cens nonante neuf sept mois,
Du ciel viendra un gran Roy d'effrayeur.
Resusciter le grand Roy d'Angolmois.
Avant apres Mars regner par bon heur.

The year 1999, Sept,
From the sky will come a great King of Terror.
To bring back to life the great King of the Mongols,
Before and after Mars to reign by good luck.

Your post just reminded me of this. Now back to your regularly scheduled program.  




 I don't think I could ever 'cull' any. They just hang out and breed and have a good time. I feed them Wardley pleco algae tabs a few times a week. Otherwise they eat leftovers. 




 I keep thinking that after she kills / removes everything from Stannis, once he is a completely broken man, she will declare another person the 'real king'.  




 I absolutely agree with you- having read all of the books multiple times and now watching the show. 

I don't know how anyone can make dany out to be a villain...if anything she was too kind in not executing every one of the masters- or letting the slaves do it. 

And Stannis is an rigid, arrogant, uptight, unfeeling asshole who just watched his only child burn to death.  

Let it begin.  




 At one time Route 19 in Florida had massive Jacaranda tree tunnels over long stretches. The ones from Crystal River to south of New Port Richey were astonishing. Bigger and more lush than in the picture here. But the greed heads came through, cut them all down, widened the road and stuck malls and mall parking lots all up and down the stretch. Some of those are abandoned now.

They could have made a secondary road for not much more money. Apparently someone hated trees, especially giant, lush purple blossomed trees that people would drive down from all over just to see.  

 




 Something like this happened in the early 60's to someones daughter that I knew. But the 2 cops took her around the corner and felt her up.

So the dad, grandpa and a few cousins and brothers went to the station and waited out back for the weasels to get off work. When they came out in their civvies they drug them into an alley and 'gave them the beat-down of their lives'. Along with a threat to do it again and worse. 

People are too complacent these days.  









 lel 




 I was thinking, just strip down in court.  







































 First one I experienced was sitting on one of those cement benches outside the San Fran airport by the drop off zone. Thought at first that there was a big truck rolling up - but it just kept rocking. 




 Some of the worst after-disaster injuries I have seen were to the feet- hurricanes and tornados. I suppose house damage is all the same- lots of broken glass, nails, etc. At least have a pair of heavy soled shoes waiting by the door.  




 Ramsey gets turned into a white walker. White Walker Bolton. You only thought he was bad before. 




 You missed just a few things:

* Tyrion is introduced to the captive dragons. They love him because he is actually the son of Joanna Lannister and Aerys Targaryon. He sneaks down during the Pit fight and releases them. They all frolic like puppies together then go burn all the masters to death. No one makes fun of Tyrion, the Dragon Rider, ever, again.

* Jorah Mormont wins the Pit fight like the man he is- then discovers that dragons blood is the cure for Stone. A dragon graciously dribbles a little blood on his patch- curing him. He and Dany kiss and make up.



 




 Start with the events that leads to this:

Aegon: Yield now, and you may remain as Lord of the Iron Islands. Yield now, and your sons will live to rule after you. I have eight thousand men outside your walls.

Harren: What is outside my walls is of no concern to me. Those walls are strong and thick.

Aegon: But not so high as to keep out dragons. Dragons fly.

Harren: I built in stone. Stone does not burn.

Aegon: When the sun sets, your line shall end.

Issue with that big community center. It is closed on Sunday and closed on Saturday unless you rent space for an event.

It's only open until 7pm the days it is open. So for working folks, guess what? The million dollar facility does you absolutely no good at all. Seniors and soccer mom hours. I understand now what this man is trying to do.

 I would probably start at the wiki that is on her and go from there. 




 Oh I was so upset about it when I saw the first news article. And it was about gopher tortoises in florida- endangered. Poor things.  




 Tortoise. And they can't swim like turtles no matter how many stupid fucking idiots throw them in ponds. Which I just found out this year was happening all over the south.  









 General? These posts were made within a few days of her abduction in 2011.

9 Miles NE - is exact. (to Zach Adams property)

Near/in a hunting preserve - is exact. (Eby's hunting preserve borders Adams property)

Tall, energetic (almost manic) man with reddish blond hair, blue eyes, ruddy, florid complexion, always kind of "wound up" - is exactly [descriptive of Zach Adams.](https://billwarnermyblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/2c29b-1795590_737386016306812_1563872713_n.jpg)

3 men altogether being the main perpetrators, two younger and one older - is exact. (and not normal in serial killer cases)

All of them are well known in the area - is exact.

That they have been arrested for breaking and entering, drugs, etc - is exact.

That they were part of a club/cult - is exact (the A Team, they called themselves)

Father/grandfather owning the property - is exact.

15 miles NE (where they found the remains) - is exact.

Video, pictures, media being important to the case - is exact.

That she was decapitated - is exact. 

That military or government land is involved - is exact. (where they found her remains is state property and also behind the Adams property, intersecting the Ebys Hunting reserve, is federal property).

That birds - bird names are involved - is exact (Adams house is bordered by Duck Farm road and Eagle Creek)

That they would be caught - is exact.

Fairly general? I would say it's damn amazing. I would also say you didn't bother to read my post, but came in with a pre-concieved belief system and were really responding to that, rather than the facts.





 




 How it's never been mentioned that suspects in the Holly Bobo case are also somehow involved in the Kristie Moon disappearance:

 Kristie Baugus Moon was dating Michael Pearcy when she disappeared 10/27/1999. According to her mother, he was the last one to see her.
 
 Michael Pearcy is the son of Mark Pearcy- both Mark and Jeff Pearcy are under arrest for being accessories and accessories after the fact in the Holly Bobo kidnapping and murder.

That is from an article I wrote after digging around for info on the Bobo case some months back- at:

http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2fxx1l/kristie_moon_disappearance_connection_with_holly/

I haven't yet seen mention of this in any articles. It's like they want the Kristie Moon case to just blow away with the wind. And the Holly Bobo case is just fucked beyond recognition.  




 Fabulous write up. Thank you, it's a fascinating bit of Americana.

Could you (or would you) post the address so we can see the house on Google Maps? This is probably as real a haunted house as any recorded.  




 The worst stories of inhumanity I ever read were of the Ustase.

 Great and gorgeous. 




 We had shots of our smoking court in my late 70's yearbook. It was not a big deal back then. 

There was not a plethora of uptight, thin lipped, disapproving, unbending, tightasses lurking around every corner waiting to smash anything outside of the right wing, talibanish, christian coalition or left wing 'gotta control people for their own good' elements. . Everything was so 'live and let live' back then. 

What the hell happened? 




 All of us. I take that back. One boy died from falling off a parking garage after a concert and another had a rare brain aneurysm at age 22 that killed him instantly.  




 Reminds me of an old torture method used by (either the Japanese or Koreans- can't recall right now) where they would starve two military prisoners and then offer each the chance to feed the other a piece of bread or eat it themselves. Either starve or let your combat partner starve.

This is just about that fucking disgusting and egregious. 

I'm finding the advertisers and calling all of them. 




 they have been working hand in hand with the multinational and 'too big to fail' corporations to turn us into a large 3rd world labor force.

Haven't you noticed the massive astroturfing against Unions and labor protections? The massive inequality? Pulling the safety net (actually an outright war on the poor lately), turning 'low education' people against those in poverty- against union and labor and pollution protections? 

It keeps up and we will be as well off as Bangladesh. 

 




 Wouldn't it be cool to have a massive walk-in closet? 

Another thing sorely lacking in garrisons  :D  




 Not back when we had unlimited sheeps with no cd :D 




 Why, yes. [Yes it does.](http://www.newlanark.org/uploads/image/CLT3.jpg)

So. Not sure what to think of all of that. So far the guy is 2 for 2 as his unedited Facebook page also predicted the Nepal quake to the day and almost the hour. 

This is not the sub for this, agreed. But I am always interested in a bit of #wierdness.  

 









 You beat me to it gereth:) West coaster here.

Couple of updates: Apparently they felt this in [India? Wow.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/7-8-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-Tokyo-mild-tremors-felt-in-many-parts-of-north-India/articleshow/47482220.cms)

Some articles are quoting 7.8 but the [Quake experts  in Japan say 8.5.](http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201505300062) 




   boars are relatively rare.

No, they aren't. A lot of people have them but don't ride them because of the animation.
 




 It actually makes me extremely sad to see my favorite game turned into this.

Me too. I did't mind dropping money for store mounts until now. And that purple cat is my favorite. But I won't buy it from principle. 




 I don't know. I did ogre beads for the real ones. 




 I still have [Carrot on a Stick] on two toons banks. Hoarder in game. 




 *grabs cane and puts uppers in*

...And I did the same with my gnome, for a cat mount. But it was harder because my legs are shorter. And people on my server had never seen a gnome on a massive cat before me, and it was good. But no one ever asked me to dance. Anywhere. 




 I swear I have been wondering if they hired some 3rd world hack/code company for the '250' new developers. I about cried when I saw what they did to my NE female. She runs like a linebacker- on quaaludes. They all look horrible. I have to keep the new art turned off- too distracting to play.  




 Apparently so do the WoD mount animators.  




 Reminded me more of a McDonalds wind up toy. 




 Old school doctors used to commonly give family members 'pain pills' to help people along who were dying of painful illnesses. Like, "..be careful, more than 5 of these will stop the heart." Unspoken but understood. 




 That's why I started /r/StormComing. There have been so many extreme weather incidents not being reported - starting a few years ago it seems - that I thought there needed to be a place for them. 




 If these millions in payouts were coming out of the FOP Retirement funds this shit would stop yesterday. 




 And I am sure it scarred her daughters for life- as it did her husband.  




 Exactly.  




  I still oppose assisted suicide.

This is fine, for you. But you should not oppose it for others if that is their choice. All I could think of while reading this is please do not let me go out this way. I will bypass chemo or any level of modern medicine besides pain meds to go quicker and less traumatically- just as most doctors do. I have thought about this for a long time now- and this story just reinforces it. 
 




 I would have played more and harder, gotten closer to some people and enjoyed it while it was great. 




 Now THAT was pvp :) 




 Asbestos was an awesome guild :) 




 Text from a post about this:

A little trip down memory lane. 
Flickr Album: https://www.flickr.com/photos/11499710@N00/

From early 40 man raids through the surprise appearance (and downing) of the BC launch Bosses, to massive Horde/Alliance raids and battles to the Shan Bu World Tour, (kited by Amaruca and my hunter, Astromeria.)

If you were with Angelic Reign, Conquest, Still Life, Angelic Crusade (Angelic Reigns Raid Guild), Asbestos, Circle of Truth, Reservoir Dogs and some others- you might see yourself in these shots.

Enjoy: 





























 Bring in some alligators and charge a few bucks at the gate. That's what they do in Florida. 




 Incredible shot. Thanks for sharing. 









 You forgot the /s :) 




 and the numbers are still higher than the end of MoP.

[End of MOP 7.4, end of March, 7.1.](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/)

Reforging was a method of fine tuning and personalizing a character. *If you didn't want to use it, you didn't have to.* And as MOP RNG was not as whack as it is in WoD, not necessary. As bad as RNG is in WoD (especially Highmaul gear and random stats on made items) it would be a welcome relief.

A lot of people enjoy spending time fine tuning and personalizing their character so that they were not just generic copies of other Pally's, DK's, etc. For instance, I loved my shockadin.

There was no reason not to leave reforging in the game. 




 We are in a minimal El Nino right now. As in,[ it is weak to moderate.](http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/anomnight.current.gif)

Compare that to a [strong El Nino](https://youtu.be/9rPqIuXlWuA?t=44s)

There is a 80%-90% possibility we may get a strong El Nino in the near future, but it will take a little time even as it strengthens to generate observable effects.

There is an approximately 90% chance that El Nio will become enhanced or strong through Northern Hemisphere summer 2015, 80% throughout 2015. 




 After leveling 2 toons to 100, I boosted my old druid to 90 who, embarrassing enough, was still at 60 from 40 man progression. I leveled to 100 through WoD.

Since there were areas of the world she missed through that, I did a ground mount only run from Ghostlands to Booty Bay last week. I wanted to enjoy the music and scenery and take my time- hitting every raid in between, from Zul Aman to Zul Gurub. 

I opened it up on the LFR and had three people by Zul Aman (all 100's) who had never been in ZA (shockingly to me). From there out we ranged between 10 and 15 players the rest of the way. Mostly 100's. 

People ended up leading mini tours through their favorite areas, and it just kind of happened that way. I showed them Rausche's grave and it was pretty goosebumpy. Then another person wanted to show everyone something else and it just took off from there. 

Best day on wow in months and months. 




 I leveled 3 100's and have blocked my other alts from progressing past 90. I don't go to draenor any longer- haven't for over a month. And I cancelled. 




 It was Blizz fault the moment they decided to blend server populations.  




 Blended servers :( 




 Oh yes, and they hate FEMA. Not a good mix.

Edit: Ok so not always. Ted Cruz voted down FEMA and emergency funds for Hurricane Sandy, but is screaming for federal funds for Texas' current disaster. http://thedailybanter.com/2015/05/ted-cruzs-mind-blowing-hypocrisy-on-texas-floods-shows-idiocy-of-republican-philosophy/ 




 face the consequences for doing so.

Blizzard is 'facing the consequences' right now- losing over 3M subs.

Actually since you aren't a professional pollster, remarks such as "Not a SINGLE person liked reforging when we had it" and all of your other subjective remarks are absolutely worthless. 

I and every other player I know, from casual to raider, liked reforging. The 3rd party apps just simplified it. 

And.. I have never, ever heard or read a player complaining about flying. That is inconceivable to me as a 10 yr player. 

I have seen a lot of blizzard apologists lately. Considering that many of the more rabid ones ("I HATE FLYING!!") are probably Blizzard employees sent out to try to prop up a dead horse- you are pretty damn extreme.  









  I don't understand why people are so dramatic when it comes to cancelling your subscription to this game.

I have one of the oldest guilds on an original vanilla server. Through the years we have made friendships - some 10 years old now. We have also lost a few people due to tragedies and illnesses. 

In our case we lost 2 friends to long term illnesses that were made a bit more bearable by the game. In these cases family members came on and met us after their passing, to request that we never remove them from our roster. And they are still there. 

So the whole "just cancel your sub and quit whining, it's only a game!" doesn't always meet with reality. 

 




 This is a great, illustrative post reflecting exactly how I have seen the evolution of the game since cross-realm. 

And the streamlining? I leveled a new toon last week to check the leveling process- I never died, I needed no help to do any of it and I popped a new level about every 3-5 quests- never finishing a quest chain. 

You can bypass entire sections of the world now. What a waste.  




 When we used to know other players, (no cross-realm) and have mount parades in IF, kite dragons/bosses to major cities, have snowball fights in the tram, etc. etc. 




 Unfortunately  I hear it is one mass apex grind for the most part. 




 In 10 yrs I never, ever heard anyone saying the game was 'too social'. Quite the opposite, a lot of people said the social aspect was what kept them in the game at periods that the content grew stale. 




 Because we screamed, yelled and threw a huge fit. One spec being 10 times more effective than the other spec? That was bullshit. 

Blizz actually apologized for this screw up.  




 ok... 




 Yep.

Point being- it's fun to swoop and fly through the air with your friends into a gorgeous sky, over a remarkable landscape. 




 They had said they were going to make an MOP style start- flying at end level but ground mount through leveling. I had no problem with that. If they had told the truth I never would have upgraded. 




 This was my concern, that a 'stuck' weather pattern may not ease up on this for some time. Just like the 'stuck' weather pattern that brought the drought to Ca and the months of flooding to the UK last year.

The reason for these stalled weather patterns is here:
https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU 

It's not what you might think. But it's the only thing that makes sense.

 Ok, if you insist.

Fixing Stormwind

----------------------------------

Has this expansion removed more than it has added?! We paid 20% more and waited 14+ months for this? Can anyone reconcile this? Never in the history of WoW have so many features been removed or scrapped. I think the community deserve an answer. 




 This whole 'anti-flying' thing is so strange. They are so vicious about it. 

No one is stopping them from walking-ground mounting anywhere they want to. 

It's almost like blizzard put a bunch of their 'new developers' out there to belittle and attack players who like to fly to try to lead the conversation. 




 Yep.. I am just one of going on 4 million players who have quit the game. Why should blizzard care about that?

From the nasty attitude of white knights like you- it apparently can't happen soon enough. That's another thing I miss about old Wow. How cool and friendly most players were. Now too many of them on the forums act like 4chan rejects. If you want to walk- then fucking walk- no one is stopping you. 

 




 Yes they did.  









 Henry Lee Lucas looks like George W. Bush in some shots. 




 Notice that all of the advertisements for the new purple cat mount show it flying over Shadowmoon Valley in Draenor?

 I guess when you have been paying a monthly fee for 10 years to a company you get to feel a little 'entitled' to get at *least* the same level of service you got from the preceding years. 

Or perhaps you are the kind of person who pays for a steak and is afraid to complain when the waitress flops a hamburger on your plate.

 




 10yr player here. The continual addition of unique content and expansion of capabilities, like flying, is exactly why I and millions of other players re-subbed month after month for years. 

 




 Pre-purchase for Draenor included a Raven flying mount and a promise by developers that flying will come 'later on'. 

It's like pre-purchasing a meal that includes a steak knife as part of the deal, but the dinner consists of stale bread and water with a promise of a steak 'later on'. So you then you get to 'later on' - and they don't even throw you a crumb.

 I have been reading the forums for years. I have never, ever seen this many upset players in all of those years. Something went terribly wrong here and it is time for Blizzard to fix it if they actually care more about the game and player base than the stockholders. 




 I was wondering about this. I am unsubbing when my last month is over. The news about flying was the final nail in that coffin, on top of the no-content train wreck of WoD. I was wondering if anyone at blizzard would be curious as to why I am unsubbing after 10 yrs.

About the 'no flying' bit:

I had a buddy who was doing design for Blizzard and she talked about the time and creativity it took to allow for play on the Z plane. 

They had to hire extra people and put in extra hours to prep areas like Elwynn forest for flight because they have unpatched, untexturized landscapes that can't be seen from a riding mount and that need finished for flight. There are also elements to coding and design that make it a bit more difficult to implement than simple ground tracking.

The (until Wod) incredible content and finish of the game is why I have paid them a monthly fee for 10 yrs. I am not going to go backwards and forego a real pleasure of the game in order to keep developers 'happy' at this stage, or save blizzard money in developer salaries.

If anti-flight players want to walk, go for it. I'm not stopping you and neither is blizzard.
 




 I did too. We used to re-train promising, 4-6yr old retired race-horses as hunter/jumpers. Getting a bit long in the tooth for more than a little pleasure and trail riding now, though. My last two horses are totally retired. Did you ever ride with your mom and sister? 




 That is gorgeous. What a joy.

I used to do 3 Day Eventing in the midwest.  




 It was the musical freestyle portion of the World Equestrian Games. This particular style of training/riding is called [Dressage.](http://www.usdf.org/about/about-dressage/)  [About training](http://www.usdf.org/about/about-dressage/dressage-training.asp). 




 I made this suggestion 3 months ago.

Got murdered. 









 [This](https://youtu.be/zKQgTiqhPbw) gives me goosebumps every time I see it.  




 Notice all of these 'life goals' go toward supporting a system that you didn't create and that benefits people and groups that run that same system. 




 Recently an upscale family owned restaurant in our area sold and had a re-design, now the logo on the sign (stylized CW) looks like a kangaroo fetus from the road. 




 It looks like one of these:

**Hero rats sniff (and snuff) out landmines and TB**

http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/26/world/africa/hero-rats-sniff-out-landmines-and-tb/ 




 I was being a bit sarcastic, but the basis is true:

The precedence set here is: "Too many bullets from too many directions hit this couple for us to determine if the defendants gun fired the actual, killing blow, therefore it doesn't meet the standard of 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. 

Court precedence can be used in any future court case to justify defenses in other cases, regardless of the status of the defendent/citizen.
