 I know some of you might not like these pics because they're of some toolish celebrities, but look at Brittney Spears, she came a long way and she looks healthy now. Anyway, heres the link. http://theberry.com/2013/09/20/they-beat-the-weight-10-photos/

I lost 50 pounds, but I need to lose another 30-40 and I've been fluctuating within ten pounds below and above my current weight for about 6 months and I just can't get there.... I'm going to Las Vegas next week for an entire 8 days and I just don't know how I'm going to not want to indulge in the food there. Theres just so much good stuff to eat, and of course I'll be with my friends and family who are going to want to eat and drink so I'm kind of thinking okay, I'll be okay indulging because I'll go hardcore when I get back... I'm just afraid I'm not going to have the willpower to go hardcore when I get back... Any advice would be great.
