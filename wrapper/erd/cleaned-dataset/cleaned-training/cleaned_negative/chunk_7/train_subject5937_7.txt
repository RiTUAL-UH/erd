 One of the largest economies in world has a stock market that goes from 2030 to 5023 from June last year to June this year, then drops 30% in a few weeks, then the government steps in with $billions to try to prop it back up, and you think it's "big whoop"?

So what is your astute investment prediction in that market?  




 This is BEAUTIFUL!!!

"I was sitting in a lawn chair looking down through the clouds at 747 airplanes and looking up to a cluster of helium balloons" 

Mr Boria said he "somersaulted out the chair" and parachuted down to safety after the balloons took him too high.

The whereabouts of the garden chair are unknown, police chief Kyle Grant said.

He "has been charged with causing *mischief*" 




 "**Evergreen**"? Really? That's what you learned from this page? How about:

"The origin of the lemon is unknown"

"The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit" ... it has ellipsoidal fruit!

"used for culinary and non-culinary purposes ... cleaning uses."

"In 1747, James Lind's experiments on seamen suffering from scurvy involved adding lemon juice to their diets, though vitamin C was not yet known."

and "lemonade"  




 Three-week plunge that has knocked around 30% off Chinese shares since mid-June

On Saturday, China's 21 largest brokerage firms said they would spend a whopping 120 billion yuan (about $19.3 billion) to try to stabilize the market

Chinese stocks plummeted yet again on Tuesday morning, defying rapid-fire emergency support measures from Beijing and raising concerns about policy makers' ability to stabilise one of the most highly volatile markets in the world.

  I'm sure she'd greatly prefer it if they ended up Christian, but she'd never say it out loud. I really wouldn't care as long as they acted right

Very insightful. Peace.  




  The fact that he has no belief system doesn't bother me

If you don't mind me asking, in my own relationship I found this very troubling - - how is it that his not being on a path to "salvation" (or whatever you want to call it) doesn't bother you? And beyond that, if you stay together and have children, how would you feel about him convincing them to be atheist? 

I ask because I have wrestled with these issues myself.  




 So, when you say "was", the moving on was not due to religious differences I take it.

It sounds like you had a deep relationship, and exploring the differences may have made it even more meaningful. Thank you for sharing.  




 I hope you take this in the spirit it is meant. While my ex was the one that was very disrespectful within our relationship (see my other post in this thread) I had difficulties with her beliefs as well.

To sum it up, the majority of Christians have a belief in an afterlife that is conditional on your behavior (yes, I've really oversimplified, but please go with me on this). 

It can be very difficult to see the person you love most as being on a path that does not lead to the afterlife that you believe in. So, while a Christian may initially say they are OK with you being an atheist, be aware - - belief is a powerful force, and as time goes on, it can really mess with how one sees their partner.  




 I've never heard of that, so I suspect you are joking.

I am the opposite. I love the outdoors (camping, kayaking, etc.) but I'm always the 1st to be bit by mosquitoes. 

If I'm bit before going to bed, I can't sleep. My heart races for an hour or two before it subsides. It really sucks.  




  the differences lie in the individuals and how willing they are about accepting each others differences

Yes - this. On so many levels, relationships are built on mutual respect.  




 I'm christian and my ex was atheist. Even though I'm not hugely religious, it was a terrible mistake. She disrespected me and made fun of my beliefs . When we had a kid, it created huge problems. 

Prior to getting married, she claimed to be "spiritual" but not affiliated with any one religion. That changed to "organized religion is evil" and "believing in fictitious beings is just stupid". 

If I get married again, I don't think it will be with someone outside my faith.  




 Everybody that just left Reddit please raise your hands.

No? I didn't think so. Based on all the complaints, I don't see much of an "exodus".  




 Oh, dog . . . no you didn't! 




 I've NEVER been able to get it to load. How hard can it be to rent more rack space to handle more traffic? I'm boggled.  




 No. While I supported the protests, it was a blip.

Reddit is 10 years old, has a strong corporate history, and last year raised $50 million in venture capital for hiring and refining the advertising business.

Reddit is in a space where controversy is bound to happen. "This has all happened before and will happen again." 




 Not a direct answer, but here's some more Reddit related info from [The Seattle Times](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/reddit-moderators-shut-down-parts-of-site-over-employees-dismissal/)

Reddit sells large, targeted advertising campaigns that run at the top of individual subreddits.

The events come at a particularly inauspicious time for Reddit, which only a week ago celebrated its 10th anniversary. Last year, Reddit raised $50 million in venture capital and planned to use the money for hiring and refining the advertising business.

The site has been valued at roughly $250 million, according to a recent disclosure by its lawyers. Advance Publications, the parent company of Cond Nast, still owns a majority of the company and retains a board seat.

The company has had its problems during the past year. Yishan Wong abruptly resigned in November as Reddits chief executive after a dispute with the companys board of directors.

Reddit has also taken steps to combat harassment on and off its site, moves that many members of the community complain have stifled the principles of free speech upon which the site was founded.

There has also been tension between factions of the Reddit community and Ellen Pao, the companys interim chief executive, whom many Reddit users blame for imposing the anti-harassment policies. An online petition asking Pao to step down has garnered more than 13,000 signatures.

Reddit users have also questioned Paos ability to lead the company while dealing with major issues in her personal life. For nearly two years, Pao was embroiled in a well-publicized discrimination lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins Caufield   Byers, the venture-capital firm. Pao lost that case in March.

 Not-voted because I'm apathetic.  




 I think you misunderstand my point. Your argument takes the form of:

Doing X is not for Y. Its for Z. Thus, if X, **you should U**. 

THAT is not how logic works.  




 It was actually very pathetic. He tried to play it off like I tricked him or something.

But there he was, completely called out as a thief and a liar. It was pretty sad.

But very sweet to get my favorite mechanical pencil back. 

PS - I thought about engraving my Montblanc, but it looks so perfect just the way it is . . . I couldn't do it.

 Clearly, I'm posting from the past in anticipation of the future. FWIW, it's better than I expected.

 Because of Pao, I have stopped using Reddit - - completely.  




 I think that marshmallow cream is too sweet to be used on sandwiches, but goes well with pineapple (only if the pineapple has a very light dusting of ground pepper)

2. Art Laffer  blah blah blah  has met with both Jeb Bush and Ben Carson

3. Laurence Kotlikoff  has advised Ben Carson  (who, and WHO?)

4. adviser Mark Spitznagel wrote a column  (you do know that hes not running for office, yes?)

5. Tim Kane of the Hoover Institute has met with four different GOP presidential campaigns  (he met with them? Shocking!) 

Thats as far as I got. I will paint all the other points with the same guilt-by-association brush that has been used in this article.

 Well, she's not wrong you know.  









 At least he did kill Hitler, so he can't be all bad.  




 Yes. I looked it up myself, and the length of time between sunsets does vary significantly throughout the year. This is *so* not intuitive to me. 

But the times I get are different than yours (I might be doing the math wrong). I get 2 hours 23 min today, and 2 hours 56 min. at Christmas. 

I think this is correct since the Earth is about 24,000 miles around, so you'd need to travel about 1000 mph (at equator) to keep up with the sun. Less at relevant latitudes. 

Did I do this right/wrong? 




  If it's just before sunset, you have about 3 hours and 27 minutes (**today**) to get from, say, Washington DC to San Diego

Again, why "today" vs 6 months from now? Just wondering.  




 Very doable since the Fastest production vehicles are:

Year, Make and model, Top speed of production car

1992	Jaguar XJ220	212.3 mph (342 km/h)

1993	McLaren F1	240.1 mph (386 km/h)

2005	Bugatti Veyron 16.4	253.81 mph (408.47 km/h)

2010	Bugatti Veyron Super Sport	267.857 mph (431 km/h)
 




 If you leave "just before sunset" why would it make any difference what day it is? Does the speed of the Earth's rotation change by the seasons?

Yes, please do. I appreciated your assistance kind stranger. Peace be with you.

Better than what?

How does dealing with, as you state it, "even the worst of our kind" relate to offering a brutal criminal a gourmet meal?  Or nice music, or incense?

Last rights - yes.

Last food/music/smells/etc. . . . No. 




 Why not a "last sound" or "last feeling" or "last smell" or "last sight"

Did his victim get any of those? 

Edit - not sure why the downvotes. This guy placed an order for delivery, demanded money, hit her in the head with a baseball bat, then placed her in a trash bin.

I don't feel he gets the right to a "last" anything. If you disagree, please explain.

 I care about Reddit, and I invest time here. Why does it not make sense to protest here?  




 But, if you are a new CEO with little experience in the market of "your" company, and you want to push a revenue agenda, what are you to do? 




 It was a protest post. Very frustrated with Reddit right now. They need to step up. 




  Trump is "aggressive sloppy and immature"

OK - I think we are close to common ground here.  




 From your post, Donald said the following: 

"When Mexico *sends* its people, they're not *sending* their best"

"They're *sending* people that have lots of problems"

"They're rapists."

Do you seriously not have any issues with this?

You really see this as a "realistic if not aggressive observation on socio-geo-political conditions"? 









 Reddit Gold Handcuffs  




 No idea what that it. 

I heard about it from a morning radio program. One of the hosts went on vacation and visited a "torture" museum, and described this invention in detail.  




 Story time. When I was a kid I was given a really nice mechanical pencil. I loved it, and used it in school all the time. As I'm sure many of you can relate, assignments were just a bit more enjoyable when using an instrument of beauty. So one day it gets stolen, and it really bummed me out. I kept an eye out, and sure enough I eventually see a kid in another class using my pencil. I confront him and he says it's his. I give him one last chance, and he digs in.

So by now the teacher has come over because I'm pretty pissed off. He still claims it's his. So I ask the teacher to remove the eraser and take out the paper underneath it. It reads "This belongs to train_subject5937". 

Busted! 




  Not really, unless you are satisfied with upvoting everyone who isn't spamming because they are technically contributing the the discussion in one way or another.

 Isn't this the same rationale against the downvoting? (There is indiscriminate downvoting to otherwise appropriate content).

Did you really just quote the entire post to which you are replying? Why would you do that? 




  Another problem a downvote bot causes it it discourages people from posting, and it makes the subreddit feel way more hostile to a new user. Even if it doesn't modify the placement on the 'new' page, it kills me to see posts at 0 or -1 points when they don't deserve it.

 I understand this sentiment, but it is overcome so quickly by other users upvoting it (if it is appropriate content).
 Both sides have good points and overall I am just concerned about any form of potential "censorship." I am kind of in a if its not too broke lets not fix it mentality in regards to the downvotes.

Quote much bro? 




 This conversation is definitely a "**cognitive load**". Peace out.
