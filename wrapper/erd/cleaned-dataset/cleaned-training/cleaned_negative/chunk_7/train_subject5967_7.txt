 I would love to see the segues for those topics. 




 Tell that to the [porn mints we have in Australia](http://www.thedistributorsperth.com/ALN-XXX-MINTS-45G_p_5219.html) 




 OH FOR FUCKS SAKE HOW DIDNT I NOTICED THE QUINTUPLE NEGATIVE IN MY IF STATEMENT

Yeah, that hits home. 




 I've done it lots of times and the only thing which has ever matched it is falling for someone.

That mix of euphoria, butterflies in the stomach and confidence is so hard to fully describe. 




 If you're a girl into voyeurism, /r/gonewild.

 




 Yep, can confirm. My house mate buys organise tooth paste and I laugh at him.

 My vegan house mate buys organic shampoo. What the fuck is organic shampoo.

He spends like $3 more per bottle than the shit we have at home. 




 You can't lose weight without exercise.

Soooo many people use this as an excuse for why they don't even try. *I can't afford a gym membership* or *it hurts to exercise* therefore I won't even try to lose weight.

This myth sucks and won't go away it seems. 




 Dude fold up a piece of TP several times and place it at the bottom of the toilet. I've not had a Poseidon's kiss in years. It also doubles as a silencer. 




 I can juggle but I don't do it in front of people because I'm afraid I'll will come off as being an attention seeking show off.

Why the fuck did I teach myself to do this? 




 I'm obese and heading toward an early grave and I **can** actually do something about it.

Luckily I discovered this truth 4 months ago before any real health problems.

43 lbs lost and counting!! 




 Hell, not even 100 years ago. You read about serial killers in the 70s and 80s, they were able to get away with so much just because mobile phones, basic forensics and centralised databases were all in their infancy. 




 Next step is to switch from kilogram to stone.

 




 Oh god this. Every year I go camping, like proper (not a single shred of electricity for 50 kms) camping. 

On of the most beautiful sights you can see is putting out your campfire and finding a clearing to sit and just staring into the nights sky. It's unbelievable.  




 A few years ago my WoW raiding guild was desperately looking for a raider for our roster. Finally out of the blue a personal applied for it and ended up being recruited. Everything was going well. We ended up having a chat and we found out that he and I actually went to high school together in the same year level, in fact we were Facebook friends!

When you take a step back and look at it, of the tens of thousands of Australians on the dozens of Oceanic servers for him to be the right class, the right level of experience, the right faction AND the right server is an insane coincidence.

 




 My favourite part of the Daily Show is always the segments where it's just Jon and a topic. No silly cut aways, no pre recorded bits with his colleagues and no interviews.

Just Jon, a topic and his passion for truth, satire and humor. 

John Olivers show is pretty much that entire thing, wrapped into a single 30 minute show. A show (which by the way, thanks to HBO) has no concerns for censorship due to sponsorship.

I would be fucking ecstatic if John Olivers show could be increased to an hour, or perhaps several 30 minute episodes per week. That being said, the show looks like they put **SO MUCH** effort into their 1 episode that this maybe hard to do. 

Either way, I'm happy Last Week Tonight exists because I'm not sure how well The Daily Show will be without Jon Stewart. 

Then again I had that worry when John Oliver took over in 2013 and boy oh boy was I happy with the result :)  




 I really enjoyed it, I think some people are just being negative nancys. I loved the plot, I liked the division between Frank and Clare. Even though I think some of her decisions were stupid.

That fucking scene with Doug turning the van around was insane, I did not see that coming!

Oh by the way, I'm so happy that Doug survived, he was one of my favourite characters. 




 This is actually one of the reasons I don't like women who're as muscular. That softness is what make women wonderful :) 




 Drink beer. 

God damn I don't know why its hot but it is :) 




 This won't compare to some of the shit in here, I guess I'm lucky.

I was pinned down by a dirt bike which had been running for hours that I had crashed. The red hot exhaust pipe was pinned against my left calf muscle for like 20~ seconds while I tried to squeeze out. That was painful, but that's not the worst part.

The worst part was that I was a 16 year old fucking idiot who didn't go to the doctors and I took very poor care of the wound. The palm sized burn ended up becoming really infected and it became so painful that I couldn't even have a blanket over my leg.

I ended up getting it disinfected and started treating it, but it took so long for that wound to heal properly. 

Gah, the smell was awful.

I don't know what's wrong with me, because a few years later I had another incident where I sliced my index finger almost down to the bone on a metal door and me fearing getting stitches (for the 4th time in my life) I just washed the wound and bandaged it tight.

It ended up getting fucking infected really bad and for the longest of time I thought I wouldn't be able to fully bend my index finger. It eventually healed but I'm kicking myself that I didn't get it properly treated. I guess I didn't want to run to my parents crying about it. 




 You show me a man who doesn't like them and I'll show you a liar. 




 It's important that it exists. If she's studying and supports herself with some sort of income - that's great! If she has a steady job, that's great! If she earns 4x my salary, that's great!

The only thing I actually care about is that she is financially responsible and can sustain herself. I don't want to date someone who has crippling debt and no want or means to remove it.

I'm not sure why that's important to me, perhaps it's because I've had financial responsibility hammered into me from my parents so much growing up. 

 I don't get the guys out there who feel emasculated because a woman earns more than you. Get over yourselves, chances are that they worked harder than you to get where they're. 




 Everyone's different, but the 1st 2 steps are essential

Totally agree, the third one isn't always a good idea, I can attest to that. If you think you can handle it, go for it. But don't do it to *fuck the pain away*, that's my experience anyway. 




 I was having this conversation with a friend who did a tour overseas in the army. It was an interesting conversation actually. He firmly states that if a woman can handle the **exact** same physical requirements as the men, then she deserves to be in the front line (in fact, he mentions several woman in high esteem who met this requirement). He told me the problem lies with fraternisation.

Sadly it happens and there is little you can do about it. When you're in the field you can't have the soldiers in relationships, it causes fractures and distractions in the team. This isn't entirely about women. Apparently this happens with gay soldiers all the time and the problem is equally as bad in those instances. Even exterior to relationships, the additional distraction of women in the front line causes problems too. You can cite this as a problem with men in society, it doesn't matter - it's likely going to happen.

I always thought that it was clear cut, if a woman want's to be a front line grunt and can handle the physical and mental requirements - then she should be able to.

But there are other portions to this equation. 




 TIL I have incidentally been correctly ingesting beer for a full experience all of these years :D 




 That's interesting, I find my fake smiles make me look serial killer-esque because of my eyes, they're too *open*? If that makes sense 




 I'm the same as far as smiles are concerned. I'm told that I have a really nice smile, in fact an ex of mine always complimented me on my (her phrasing) *Smiley Eyes*, it used to make her melt.

But that never translated to pictures. I cannot take a picture without me looking like a smiling mad man.

Kinda sucks  




 He really knows how to play to the fanboys. We really are easy to rile up ;) 




  there are a number of organoleptic sensations that occur with the swallow including a big impact from retronasal olfaction.

As an avid lover of beer, I think I subconsciously already knew that when I asked the question haha

I just didn't know if there was a term for it, that beer after taste/smell is rather intoxicating (pun intended) 




 Good reminder to everyone.

Something else to keep in mind - the time will go **much** quicker if you let what you're doing become part of your daily routine. But it will also go quick if you don't spend too much of your day obsessing over it. That's where I get a little conflict in me. This subreddit is an awesome place if you need support or information, but it can be bad if you're an impatient person.

Ever had a boring class in highschool where you're constantly looking at the clock on the wall? Time tends to go slower that way. So while I'm not telling people to go away from this subreddit, I would recommend not looking at the clock as often if you're impatient. 




 Why not organise a cheat day for it? I had a long weekend trip interstate last weekend, so for 2 days I drank and ate merrily. I went back into my diet the day after and I still ended up losing weight this week.

Don't feel like you have to constantly say no to everything, you need to find balance. 

I probably won't have another cheat day for a while, but I earned the shit out of last weekend that's for sure. 




 I totally get where you're coming from, I've been sober for the past 4 months in an effort to lose this weight. It's been somewhat tough, I came to realise that you don't have to drink heavily to have fun, as lame as that sounds it's true!

I found that while you can have a cheat night every now and again, try just drinking water. You can be the designated driver for your friends, they'll likely love you for it.

The point is that if you're serious about dropping some weight, you do need to make sacrifices. If the amount you drink every week is what's stopping you, you need to weigh up your wants versus your needs.

Something I tell myself every weekend when I think about having a drink is "the reason that your friends can drink is because you overdid it for years and they didn't. You've had enough, it's time to work off the deficit"

Granted this information is from a guy who is quite a bit more overweight than yourself, I think it may still be helpful. 




 The biggest change I did was to completely cut beer out of my life, that would've been so much harder if it were my job!

Are you able to just spit the beer out for work? I would imagine that to maintain a deficit and still drink beer, that you would be a bit more hungry since you're not getting as many non-empty calories. 




 Jenny the fucking whore.

I'm pretty sure I'm lying to myself to think that the whole thing wasn't made up, but I kind of want a closure follow up.

True or false, that story was an emotional rollercoaster. 




 I'm kind of the same. I always watch the teaser and I always watch the first trailer. After that... I don't watch shit.

I had to learn this the hard way, I'm doing this with Ant-man and I find that I'm way more excited for it. I saw the teaser and the first trailer and I'm fucking sold. I don't need anymore marketing to convince me this will be good.

I'm a little bit sad that the Thomas the Tank Engine gag was in the trailer. I hope that doesn't take away from the scene when we watch it in the film. 




 Good point actually, remember that episode of Family Guy where Brian has sex with Quagmire's post op father and when he finds out he does that extended vomit scene?

He copped shit loads of flak for that scene from the LGBT community.

That being said, Mcfarlane's response was rather interesting.

[He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quagmire%27s_Dad#Reception)

Although Ace's scene was a parody of The Crying Game, the humor would be mostly lost in 2015. 




 It took fucking ages in this trailer to event point out that it's even in the Rocky universe... I like it.

They could just as easily have made Sly the main star of the trailer. But Sly doesn't even turn up till like the last quarter of the video.

This movie may actually be the closest movie to the first Rocky since the first Rocky.

 




 Mimic spaghetti  




 As long as there is reform to allow for a divorce, I don't see why it shouldn't be allowed. 




 You mother fuckers put your wallet in your back pocket? Isn't sitting on it uncomfortable? 




 Ex smoker reporting in, I don't hate you guys

I know exactly what you're going through :) 




 I'm an ex smoker, so I have empathy for them. I also know what it's like hearing non smokers loudly judge you about your choice to smoke, so I don't do that with anyone.

My opinion is that the vast majority of young smokers have no real grasp of the consequences of what they're doing. They think they're invincible because they know someone who smoked till 80. 




 Just to give you a measure of speed of lost, I'm a 27 yo 5'9 male. 4 months ago I was 285 lbs, I'm now down to 242. 

I was losing crazy amounts of weight in the first month. I easily dropped the first 18 lbs in the first month. After that it soon started to taper off rather quickly, without me changing my diet at all.

At higher weights you're always going to lose weight quicker **at first**. Assuming that you're not eating too little and exercising too much, you should be fine.

Of course, I would talk to a doctor and do some research of your own.

 Well done though! ~50 lbs is a great feat!

 




 So what you're saying is that BMI obesity is like determining erotica from pornography?

*I'll know it, when I see it* 




 Best answer so far, so fucking funnny 




  I'd be really good with the "why?" game.

I'm not sure this game is about answering questions :( 




 Iirc, at the start you can hear it called over the announcment 




 Perhaps I'm in the minority here, but I've never met a man who thinks like this. In fact, most of my mates all talk about wanting to date someone who has a solid career, doctors, lawyers etc.

I'm starting to suspect that many of these 'common reddit occurrences' of the genders are fringe cases. Or, perhaps I'm living in the fringe. 




 To be fair, there are some strange questions posted on /r/askmen too and you know what?

So there should be, go ahead - ask me my opinion on women with non symmetrical shoulder freckles. 




 In my naive youth, I never had this conversation and I regretted it a few years ago when I started dating someone who had caught something from a recent ex.

It almost derailed our relatively new relationship.

Have the conversation before you stop using protection (See /u/Little_Lion 's top comment), luckily for me it was one of the curable diseases. 




 I'm 5'9 and a half, which is pretty much bang on average. I don't have a single second of insecurity. Partly because I know how guys even only 3-4 inches shorter are perceived.

 




 Welcome to armchair activism :( 




 I work in IT, there is so much gossip talk. It's so fucking frustrating.

I just walk away when the shit talking starts. 




 Lets face it, we all do this. 




 I'm debt free at 27, so there's that. 




 Well this thread sure took a turn towards sexy (   ) 




 Competition 8-ball pool. I've been playing for a decade and I currently run a team :)

I love it 




 My last relationship started like this. I got a FB message from a friend asking if I was single and if I were interested in a cool chick he knew. I was curious so I said yes. 

We chatted on Facebook for a bit and hit it off. Dated for almost a year, it was quite nice actually.

I'd almost rather meeting girls via friends. That way you can get someone you know and trust to vouch both to me and the other person.

Helps weed out the crazies too :D 




 Any argument against gay people getting married, I've not seen a reason which isn't just silly. 




 Just plain shirt, jeans and casual shoes.

Fashion is a stupid concept. 




 Thanks for posting this twice, you deserve double the upvotes. 




 Its also a diuretic so it helps with water weight! :P 




 I've been wearing a wrist watch since I've been able to tell time. I want to be able to tell the time quickly and in a less rude manner than pulling my phone out. 

It's also a sentimental thing, my parents bought me my current watch 10 years ago. I love this thing, it's my only piece of jewelry. Buy a good quality watch guys, this one has never skipped a beat in 10 years and it's eco-drive so it charges the battery when I fap :P 




 After my break up with a serious relationship in my early 20s, I went out and had a rebound hook up. I moved WAY too fast, I was trying to replace a lost part of me from the break up.

She ended up moving in with me very quickly and I didn't even really like her all that much. The sex was average and our chemistry wasn't even all that solid. She was actually kind of crazy.

I ended up regretting having that empty hookup for the longest of time. As cliche as it sounds, random hookups really are not worth pursuing in that context.

I should qualify that ONSs are only really bad if you're trying to replace someone instead of having fun with a stranger. 




 Reddit loves a good pun, the top comments of threads are mostly puns. I love it so much.

 




 In your defence, what sane person would turn the car around to search for that plastic bag. 




 They're not reviled. I've never actually met anyone who *hates* dad jokes. You get people who groan at them, but in my entire 27 years of existence I've never actually had anyone tell me to seriously stop telling bad jokes.

 




 Tzatziki.

I've been looking like a fucking idiot pronouncing it as tis-iki instead of zat-ziki
 




 Adding onto this, brush your tongue. Both of these practices will fix most of the bad breath out there.

You'd be surprised how much gunk is stuck on your tongue.

I started flossing every day a while ago and my teeth have never been whiter.  




 I'm 40 lbs down, this is my main secret. No booze, no sugary drinks. Just water and the occasional coffee.

That shit adds up quick in your daily calorie intake. 




 Thank you! Credit cards are only a bad idea if you use them wrong. If you use them as short term loan machines, then you're using them right.

Need $200 for emergency car repairs and fully intend to pay it back over the next pay check or two? Then you're a smart credit card user. 




 I love his work.

What I really admire is that he takes the same stance on his routine as George Carlin. He scraps his routine every year and writes new material. You have to respect that his act changes every year. Check out his specials, they're wonderful. 

Also, his stance on selling his DRM free content is remarkable. He does all of his own directing, shooting and editing then he provides *direct to the consumer* digital downloads. You can actually download his stand up specials for a one off payment of $5 and he makes some serious cash out of it. It's quite brilliant.

Plus anyone who can make me laugh about sexually stimulating a sewer rat has some real skill in comedy.

 




 It may be, but litter collectors would still be employed. There would just be ~~less~~ **fewer** of them.


Edit: Fine Stannis, its changed. Are you happy? At least my family's still alive. 




 Your straw false dichotomy hominem has triggered me. 




 I assume he means the public comment section, I *never* **ever** go there for Facebook or Youtube. It's just plain retarded to read.

In fact, I only ever read comments on things which only my friends are involved in. 




 If used right it can have a good effect on your life. 

Since I started using portions of reddit for information and support rather than lulz and dankness, I've lost 40 lbs, exercise frequently, formed better dental hygiene practices and learned quite a lot of trivia.

Shoutout to /r/loseit, /r/askreddit, /r/askmen, /r/askwomen, /r/progresspics, /r/fatlogic, /r/fitness and /r/todayilearned. 




 I think the problem is minors possessing porn *of* minors. That's illegal. 




 Not all litter is caused by people littering you would think, what about things like trash cans being knocked over by the wind, animals breaking open trash bags etc

Edit: My point is that even if these non human sources of litter only accounted for a small percentage of litter, the job of litter collector would still exist.

Edit 2: I get it, in a perfect world litter wouldn't exist. This thread isn't about a perfect hypothetical society. And not picking up everyone elses trash doesn't make you a *dick*. If it did, *litter*ally 99% of us would be dicks. 




 Funny story, this movie was released in Australia a few months after the US release as *The Wrong Man*. The reason being was that [the name *Lucky Number Slevin* was determined to be a spoiler by the critics after the US release lol. Because they saw the link between the horse at the start named Slevin and the main characters fake name] (/spoiler)

Excellent fucking movie though, very original and fun story. 




 Thanks, trust me when I tell you this - it will go so fucking quick! Just let what you're doing become part of your daily routine and try not to obsess over it every day.

It's been 4 months and it feels like 4 weeks. 




 Everyone is different. Some would rather many small meals throughout the day and that's fine. Others (like me) prefer to have 2 larger meals for the day.

The latter suited me better, so my change was to work out the rough calories for the meals I like. Once I had that number and determined how much my body requires at a safe deficit I (through willpower) stopped myself from eating.

I know consciously that my body had enough energy to keep going and the hunger I was feeling was superficial. Once you objectify food as an energy source and not solely as a source of pleasure, you realise how easy it can be to put the fork down.

So as strange as it sounds - *I fixed my relationship by objectifying my partner*.

Come at me foodi-nazis. 




 Oh, you're a woman? Yeah, guys have it much easier :(

My window for reaching my deficit safely is much larger, so 200~ calories over isn't the end of the world  




 That makes sense, I would imagine it would be hard to fit 5 guys into a daily food budget. 




 It really isn't that big of a deal, not in the long run. Once you see that you need to consume 3500 *extra* calories over your budget to gain a single pound of fat - you can see that going a bit over once in a while isn't the end of the world.

The important thing is to make sure that you don't have these cheat meals too often. Weight loss is about long term consistency. It's fine to stop your marathon for a few seconds before continuing :) 




 Your title is punderful ;)

Nice one, i'll be there in another 40 lbs :D 




 yesterday I fit Five Guys into it as well.

Please tell me this is some American food, otherwise this post got a little weird o.o 




 Do I think it's bad that some people find you more attractive than before? Hell no, that's a good benefit of weight loss - attractiveness is attractiveness, that goes for all sexes.

Do I think it's tactless of this idiot spouting "I would've liked you had you not been fat"? Yes. 

You're not being sensitive to this dick being so brash with you. As a guy, I hate hearing about these dickheads who give the majority of us a bad reputation.  




 After doing it for a while, don't you eventually learn the calories of your favourite foods? I'd imagine that there would be quite a bit of intuitive eating involved during maintenance. 

I'm just a sucker for routine, so by knowing what meals contain X calories, I can organise lunch/dinner to fit my budget without counting a thing in detail. 




 Am I the only one in here who has friends who are girls who I would consider 'one of the guys', just because she fits in well with us in social settings? 

I'm seeing lots of judgement for women who want to hang out with their male friends without feeling like they need to censor themselves around here.

This type of relationship is very common for the girlfriends of my friends. 

I'm starting to realise that the experience of the average redditor is not the experience of the average real person.

Edit: speeling 




 I'm so fucking excited, its such a good casting choice. Also, the fact that he is taking it so seriously tells me that he will do the source material justice. 

You hear that constantly from actors who play superheroes, that they don't want to upset the fanboys 




 I'm a little bit worried after this latest season, it wasn't really their best. I still enjoyed it, but there has been a tonal shift in the past few years. 

More specifically, I hope they do a factory reset with this meta humor shit from last season. 

That being said, the show will continue to be funny and watchable as long as idiots do idiot things :) 




  I didn't find this episode any different than any other previous episodes


You're totally on the money here, it was **exactly** the same as his normal episodes.

I think when some take issue with the main segments premise, it throws a spanner in the works for the show itself.

I guess that's a good thing? The show would be boring if you totally 100% agreed with everything that John says :)

Solid episode

 




 YES! Upvote to you, that's the one! 




 GW is tricky, not because it's unobtainable. but because I don't know what the number will be like when I decide to start gaining lean mass.  




 She took a picture? That's creepy as shit. 




 My current car is a 2008 Toyota Camry manual. The reason why this is so special is because years ago I spent **months** searching for a manual version of this car. I easily went through 40-50 cars and this one was the only manual which existed.

It makes me kind of sad actually, I would happily drive manuals for the rest of my life but so few are being manufactured. 




 Nah, that's not it. It's close though. Ill keep doing some digging. 




 That wouldn't be completely fair. My old job (during peak hours) I had to take 2 trains for a total of an hour to get there and riding a bike would take even longer. Driving took around 30 minutes and non of my colleagues worked in my direction. 




 I didn't actually drive an automatic until I had my full licence for 3 years. I couldn't believe that people could actually drive using only half of their limbs.

 




 They're not really fond of 'dude' either 




 I totally agree with this, when I first got my licence, my insurance company offered to shaved 10% off my premium if I took part in a defensive driving course.

I have to say, that afternoon was incredibly helpful. We learned how to recover from a skid, how to identify un-roadworthy problems with your car and how different speeds can affect different braking distances.

It made me a much more capable and confident driver, 10 years later and I've still never had an accident. 




 This sort of fits the question.

But there was a CEO of a company a while back who jokingly stated that his product 'was kinda crap'. That statement was taken literally and the stocks in his company dropped and he ended up going bankrupt. 

He had an effect named after him, can anyone remember what it's called?

Edit: Thanks /u/bigscience87 it's called the [Ratner Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ratner) 




 I get what you're getting at, but some people will still always do under the speed limit, I can't see having different lane limits changing that, also adding extra limits on the fast lane will likely make the fast line more congested.

I like the concept of 'keep to the left/right (depending on country lol) unless overtaking) 




 I assume you mean replace all traffic lights with roundabouts ? 









  Step 4: Call her dad

Warning, most girls hate it when you call them Dad. 




 Finally getting that annoying piece of food between your teeth out with your tongue. 




 I knew a guy who owned a house he was renting out to a few people, he had a legit house rule of 'if it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown flush it down' for the toilet. His reasoning? "Saving money on the water bill"

He meanwhile would take 30+ minute showers. I tried to tell him that shaving 10 minutes off a shower would save a weeks worth of 'yellow' flushing. 




 It's an **amazing** film, but it'll emotionally wreck you. So much so that I won't be rewatching it, despite me really enjoying it. 




 They're best enjoyed just eating by themselves like grapes.

So fucking tasty :D 




 You mother fucker, you had me till the last sentence. 




 The Tomacco episode of the Simpsons, that shit was perfect. 




 have you ever tried pickled garlic cloves? Oh sweet jesus they're delicious 




 A-are you a girl? 




 That chick is fucking shit at negging. 




 Oh sweet jesus that is a ridiculous cat. 




 OH MY GOD! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAAAAACEEEEEEEEEE 




 Liero.

Try to pick it apart you monsters. 




 The problem isn't just the fat, the bigger issue is the calories. So many calories.

I've not had cheese in the longest of times due to it being so calorically dense. 




 Worst sitcom, ever.
