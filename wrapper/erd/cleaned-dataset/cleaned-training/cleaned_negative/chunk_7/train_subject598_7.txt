 Joseph Campbell's spin on that, "The fool says in his heart there is no God' (Psalms 14:1). There is, however, another type of fool, more dangerous and sure of himself, who says in his heart and proclaims to all the world, 'There is no God but mine.'" - Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God, Vol. IV: Creative Mythology, p. 28 




 
Honestly, I just feel like Apple Pay pushes the act of spending further into the abstract. Maybe simple impediments to purchasing like finding my wallet are a good thing.   Besides, the idea that Im burdened in some way by having to swipe my cards seems silly. Apple pay is a solution looking for a problem. Lets make fun of it.  

 




 yes 




 i recently contacted a Microsoft Store about a service issue and they were anything but helpful.  If you can take it back to the retailer you should.

In general, do everything possible to avoid dealing directly with the manufacturer.  they don't give a fuck. 




 I will upvote Rome gifs all day 




 this a great one.  It's the recorded oral tradition and a great read. 









 The blue crew basically executes promotions for the marketing department.  Things may have changed but at the time we were under the same direction of the guy who signed off on the music, graphics, etc.   

Most nights were routine. You come in, talk about the promotions running that night; who was going to escort Charles Glen (or whoever, I believe it was still alternating) to the ice, who was going to round up mighty mites and their parents and get them through security, etc.
We would pick the participants for contests from people on the concourse early so if my friends were going to the game I made sure they knew to be there early and to hang around the section where we came out on to the concourse so they could get one ice for whatever we were doing that night. Officially it was frowned upon but it was understood that if you had friends at the game they could participate in the promotion.

Once I got to wear plain clothes and walk around with a radio and pick the winners for contests on fan appreciation night.  Totally arbitrary; if I dug your shirt, you were the guy.

Probably my favorite story though was one night after the slingshot bowling thing on the ice.  We would get reminded all the time that we HAD to be off the ice before the intermission clock got to a certain time or the Blues would get fined by the NHL.  I think it was 10 minutes but Im not sure.   So we do the sling shot bowling and it goes like it normally does and its time to go.  I unlatch the big bungee cord from the penalty box side of the ice and start to gather it up. At I start to head for the Zamboni pit the guy out there with me starts yelling at me.   I run over and the bench door is closed on the cord and the thing is wedged shut.  We got a guy from the ice crew  over to help us out and the thing just isnt budging.  The clock is ticking down and there is still a huge bungee cord laying all over the ice. So with seconds left I run out and start gathering up the cord and start throwing it onto the bench and dove over the boards as time expired.  We couldnt just hang out on the bench so we ended up cutting the cord and leaving via the locker room which was kind of cool.  

Little things:  

A lot of European players play soccer in the halls to warm up, 

Saw Panger doing a national Hockey night broadcast for ESPN once and he would stand on a box when doing the pregame with Steve Levy.  Just a tiny man.

You all know that Christ Pronger was a beast but Im 61 and generally am thought of as a big guy.  Standing next to Pronger made me feel like less of a man. On skates the guy was just a monster.

I know a guy who managed to turn multiple years on the blue crew into a front office career in the NHL.

The actual Blues offices where the GM and everyone works are right there at Scott trade.  Its the door to the right of the parking garage entrance.  (it just never occurred to me.)
 




 i was on the blue crew for 2 years. back when it was coed.  kind of fun shooting t shirts out of a cannon and watching people eat it in giant hamster balls
 




 I was able to use my windows install disk to boot into safe mode.  I updated all the drivers for my mother board and restarted.  so far so good. 




 I also like this movie way too much.  I made these a while back.

 This is a new build (my first) that I finished last week. It's been running great since that time. Yesterday i turned it on and it booted to a blank blue screen with the cursor. I attempted to windows boot disc repair and system restore without any luck. I've checked the ram one stick at a time as was suggested for similar problems here and on toms hardware, no luck there.

This might not be related but at one point last night it booted up normally and while i was was playing a game my wife turned a TV on(i have the HDMI out on the videocard going to a 4x2 HDMImatrix and the second monitor disabled) which seemed to cue the blue screen. Hasn't booted since so i haven't had the opportunity to try and replicate that but it seemed relevant.

I've seen some suggestion for similar issues to attempt to reboot in safe mode and make sure my mobo drivers are up to date. maybe try and older driver for the video care? I'm going to give these 2 a shot first when i get home.

Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

 Keen Eddie was amazing and died before it's time. 




 Deadwood. Jesus, how is that show not at the top of this list. 




 I've tried the other PCI slot without success.  I'm using HDMI but you are correct, nothing from the board or the video card when booting
 




 the power cables look good and I've updated BIOS.  I dont have access to another machine i could try the card in though. 




 I just finished my first build. Without the GPU the system boots fine and runs normally but once the GPU is attached the screen just stays blank. Fans spin and lights come on but nothing else. 1 long beep then 3 short. Some googling pointed me towards the possibility bad video card. any other ideas? Any assistance would be appreciated.

 distance running.  I will run 40's, ride a bike, hit the elliptical, incline treadmill, stairs, hill sprints, whatever, but FUCK running. It's just the worst.
