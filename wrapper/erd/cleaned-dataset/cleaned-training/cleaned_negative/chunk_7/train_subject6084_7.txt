 UPDATE: probably a false alarm if [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ebola/comments/2irvwf/british_man_dies_of_disease_in_macedonia/cl4wwgz) is correct.  














 That's another thing and is worthy of debate. The survery in OP's link was *explicitly* asking about banning things that don't exist.

Survey Monkey should have asked "Are you in favor of banning entry to people originating from an Ebola stricken country?".  




 It's worth pointing out that the question as it was posed is moot.  **There are no flights** directly to the US from Liberia or Sierra Leone.

 The person being transported to the hospital is an employee with the Dallas County Sheriff's Office who was in Duncan's apartment, NBC 5 has confirmed.

 Also from that link:

 CBS 11 has confirmed that the patient checked yes to one of the screening questions regarding travel to West Africa.   




  The patient claims to have had contact with the Dallas 'patient zero'

So many questions on this. If they did have contact, were they on the CDC watchlist, if not, why not? Is this "claim" just bogus? 









  Frudakis' company, DNAPrint, has yet to turn a profit and may not survive much longer. 

[Looks about right...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNAPrint_Genomics)

 The company ceased operations in February 2009. 




  The list is incomplete.

It sure is. There have been 12 fatal shootings by police since 2000 in Montreal *alone*. [Check out the red markers in this map.](http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/policeshootings/index.html)

There are way more in the US though, this is true.

 




 [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3298261/) examined dogs in a 2001-2002 outbreak in Gabon and seems to be the main source of information on this, and yes, dogs can be asymptomatically infected.

There is a very interesting thing in this paper:

 dogs appear to be the first animal species shown to be naturally and asymptomatically infected by Ebola virus. 

Needless to say, it would be *very* useful to know the biological mechanisms involved in that.
 









 You know media outlets update their stories, right? When this was posted the story was *very* short and didn't contain this sentence.  




 [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ebola/comments/2igp2w/nurse_infected_with_ebola_in_spain/cl23a5d) from another thread is worth reading. I cannot vouch for the translation. Relevant and eye-opening quotes: 
(edit: emphasis added)

 The infection event is still under investigation; **she went twice into the patient's room**: once to assist him and then after the former patient died. No accidental contact was reported.

 The infected nurse went on vacations the day after the former patient pased away. Her husband is being questioned to elaborate a list of people with who she was in contact.

 First symptoms (temperature under 38.6C) were reported on September 30th. She has been controlled twice a day since then. She mostly stayed at home. 




 This is the first actual *infection* to take place outside Africa right? 




 This is the one Al-Nusra urged ISIS to release. He was just a charity worker. Fuck these guys. 




 How much turmeric would you have to eat to get their dose of curcumin (500mg twice daily)? Is it feasible?
 




 But, but... Hollywood movies tell me that there are crack teams in hazmat suits expertly drilled to deal with situations like this! Everything I've seen so far leads me to believe that they are hopelessly prepared. 














 Sounds like a story out of Liberia but no, this is Dallas. 




 If that's the case it would be Darwin Award level stupidity on his part, if the story of him carrying around an ebola patient is true. I guess we don't know enough yet. 









 Very relevant, from [this story](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/01/us-health-ebola-usa-idUSKCN0HP2F720141001):

Duncan, in his mid-40s, helped transport a pregnant woman suffering from Ebola to a hospital in Liberia, where she was turned away for lack of space. Duncan helped bring the woman back to her family's home and carried her into the house, where she later died

 




 Agreed, but it is probably worth noting that it was the researchers' University *itself* that chose that title for their press release.

 The fact that those two mutations can produce such a remarkable change in phenotype is the whole point of the paper.

 It is interesting that the curves differ by country. Liberia is showing a scary  exponential growth in cases. Sierra Leone and Guinea, not as much. 




 [This graph](http://i.imgur.com/wAZTLKG.png)  really is looking exponential. ([Original source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_epidemic_in_West_Africa#mediaviewer/File:Diseased_Ebola_2014.png))

 They don't harm humans, but you really don't want to be small enough to be a pseudoscorpion's next meal:

 the venom is used to capture and immobilize the pseudoscorpion's prey. During digestion, pseudoscorpions pour a mildly corrosive fluid over the prey, then ingest the liquefied remains.
