 Finally the day has come: The Big Bang Theory premieres its 8th season with not one, but two episodes! What will happen to Sheldon this season, where did he go? When will he return. We know as much as the official synopsis tells us


In the Season 8 premiere (The Locomotion Interruption), Amy and Leonard take a surprise road trip to Arizona to retrieve Sheldon, while Penny goes on a job interview at Bernadettes company, and Howard has problems wrapping his head around Stuarts relationship with Mrs. Wolowitz.

TBBT S08E02 ( The Junior Professor Solution) finds Sheldon who is ordered to teach a class, and the gang is surprised when Howard signs up to take it; and tensions between Penny and Bernadette afford Amy an opportunity to play one against the other.

The Big Bang Theory airs from 8 to 9 pm on CBS.
