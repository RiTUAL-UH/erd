  I feel like a plan to kill 2 million feral cats by Greg Hunt is likely to involve something like importing 5 million feral dogs.

And then they'd have to import 5 million feral wolves to kill the feral dogs... 

































































































































































































































































































 **Could you introduce yourselves?**

Hey there, I'm /u/train_subject6188! I've been on Reddit for almost two years now.

**How did you get involved here?** 

To be honest, there were three reasons I started the sub, one of which /u/carmabound has already covered. The second was that I joined the Mod Squad at /r/worldnews about a year and a half ago and thought it would be a good idea to learn how to do mod stuff without accidently tripping over the wires and unplugging a default. The third reason was there really isn't a sub out there that will allow me to post my jabberwocky.

**How would recommend your sub to new users**

If you're looking for a place to chill out and hang, pour yourself a drink and come talk story.


**Aims for this subreddit?**

Haven't the slightest clue.

**Favorite posts?**

All of them on /r/train_subject6188, of course! 




 Yay and thank you to /u/handicapreader and /u/carmabound!

As well as the fine folks at /r/TinySubredditoftheDay 




  They should consider Vancouver over Toronto if nature is what they're after.

I've never had the pleasure of going over to Vancouver. Have been through Toronto twice, when I drove from Chicago to New York through Canada...talk about taking the long, scenic route!

I really liked the drive and Toronto too. 









































































































































































 Lot's of positive vibes coming from these kids and it's good to see that they really do want to venture out of Japan. 















































































 This story should be used in the travel brochures for Norway because after reading this, I really want to hop on a plane to the Historical Museum in Oslo. 









 It's always me, isn't it?
