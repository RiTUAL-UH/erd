 What highlighter did you use? 
I currently use Benefit's High Beam;however, sometimes I feel like it is just too shiny. 




 All I can say is that if you are in it for the students, you will go far...if you are in it for other reasons you will burn out quickly..good luck! 




 Most states require you to take a teacher certification exam like the praxis and they typically require you to complete a student teaching semester/s. 

Just curious, why do you want to become a teacher? (The degree that you have is not as important as your passion for teaching and your passion for your students)

If you haven't taken any education classes I would recommend doing some reading on teaching, observe some classrooms, talk to an expert teacher etc. Make sure that you want to be a teacher of students first and a teacher of your content second.
