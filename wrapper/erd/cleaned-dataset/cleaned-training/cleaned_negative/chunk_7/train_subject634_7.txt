 Justin wong vs Chris G off-stream [](/4Head) 




 Lol bopped off-stream? 




 I Cross beat ChrisG. Japanese player. 




 About the last paragraph, I had to put something down for EVO down haha. Didn't want to make my thread look biased towards Capcom Cup lol. 




 Pros for Evo:

- Most prestigious tournament due to its long-standing history
- Insane competition. Have to battle out between 2000+ players
- Biggest fighting game tournament in terms of media, attention from FGC and mainstream public and amount of foreign players entering it
- Biggest points allocated as a premiere event
- Good prize pool


Pros for Capcom Cup:

- Insane competition. Have to battle out between the top 32 players of the entire year.
- Dat 120K and biggest ever prize pool.
- Points wise and organisation-wise from CPT, this is the most important event because every tournament leads to THIS.

What do you think?
 




 Daigo vs Momochi rivalry has been one of the most enjoyable rivalries for me to watch in Ultra SF4. Their meetings have been real close:

2014 Topanga Ranking Battle - Banzuke (Wakou): Daigo 2-0

2014 Topanga Ranking Battle - Banzuke (Akihabara): Daigo 2-0

2014 Topanga A League 4th - 1st Stage Online: Momochi 3-0

2014 Topanga A League 4th - 3rd Stage Offline: Daigo 8-6

2015 SXSW Invitational: Momochi 2-0

2015 Topanga World League 2: Momochi 5-1

2015 Stunfest: Momochi 3-2, Daigo 3-1, 3-1


Overall: 21-21

WOW [](/Kreygasm) 




 He's being used as a strike bowler. One advantage he has over other journeyman workhorse bowlers is that he REAL pace, which is why his potential as a legit test bowler is still bright for him. 




 Remember when you said Momochi's Capcom Cup was self-explanatory? I wasn't sure what you meant so I went through his bracket again to check and he BEAT:

Snake EyeZ, Bonchan, Valmaster, Ryan Hart, Infiltration, Luffy, Xian (x2)

So he beat 3 EVO champions along the way to win the title. [](/Kreygasm) 




 What did Santarou say? Translation?
