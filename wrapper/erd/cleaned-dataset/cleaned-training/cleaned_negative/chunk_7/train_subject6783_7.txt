 the doctor was very cost conscious. i took this picture while waiting to see him.

 it was at a local radiological imaging facility instead of a hospital. the doctor referred me there because he said it would be much cheaper. i asked at the front desk when i signed in and they told me one amount. after i filled out all the paperwork, they gave me the updated amount at a different counter.  




 it's the insurance companies that middle man all this shit that drives the price up. i recently had to have a ct scan. they told me it was going to be $550 then found out i didn't have insurance. "oh you're paying cash? then it will be $247."
