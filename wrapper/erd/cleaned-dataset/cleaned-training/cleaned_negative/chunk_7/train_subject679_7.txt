 YES. OH GOD. I had forgotten this one till now. 




 I dislike that one too. Not hate with a fiery passion but really dislike. Why. Why is it played so much. 




 I have nothing against Hotel California. I don't know why she hates it. It's kind of what inspired me to post this, because I like seeing what weird things set people off. I also have a friend who hates the word "moist." In conclusion, quirks are neat and I just rambled a lot. 




 A friend of mine really really hates "Hotel California." To the point that she'd rather listen to static. I feel similarly about Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood." I've seen posts talking about favorite songs and classic songs, but I'd like to know about the songs you hate! 




 Nacho Crunch Grilled Stuft burritos. Holiday Spice Pepsi. My ex fiancee worked at the pepsi plant and we had cases and cases of the stuff. I should have appreciated it more.
