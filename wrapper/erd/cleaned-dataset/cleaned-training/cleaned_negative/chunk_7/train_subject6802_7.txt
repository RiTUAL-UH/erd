 Don't know why you're getting downvoted, I totally agree.  




 I feel like it wasn't THAT intense for me but I definitely see what you mean. I wanna be a monster truck driver and have half naked men hang from the hood.  




 she looks stunning though  




 my uncle works in Beijing and he doesn't leave the house without one... got to admit it still looks kinda scary and weird 




 Women get their labia cut off and sewn up, making sex extremely painful, and oh yeah sometimes die in childbirth because of it too. Some dudes are unhappy because someone said they can't fully appreciate sex because they are circumcised. No one is actually sure this is true because they don't know what it feels like to have sex uncircumcised. Clearly these two issues are exactly the same. 




 This would annoy me 




 sorry i didn't know you were the reddit police won't happen again 




 I thought it was cute my 83 y/o grandpa was playing on this taped together gameboy he's had for like 30 years. But apparently you are all too damn salty and very professional redditors who only appreciate serious content. (Also, google stock image, because this is not one)

 Judaism is lovely though, mmmkay

 These were all the rage on german christmas markets

 Agent Provocateur lingerie. Bought a set that was on sale but still heavily overpriced. Wore it less than a handful of times and washed it cold, by hand, as specified on the label. Literally disintegrated after that. Apparently they started manufacturing in China but kept their pricing... There's a lot of unsatisfied customers on their FB page...
