 Trippy art :) 




 Ay 




 Holy cow, I tried decoding the last line as base64, and look:

(NjA5MTA=) = (60910) = (6/09/10) 




 Oh yes my friend, oh yes. 




 Yes, but they usually just decode to numbers. 




 I'm not afraid ;-) 




 "ping!" 




 We want something. 









 LOL... I honestly found it funny! 




 Oh... I guess we need better moderation in the subreddit. 




 Egypt? 




 WOAH LOOOOBEN!!! 




 You turned me on... *blushing* 




 Nice picture :) 




 Ew x_x 




 In middle school... my old music teacher tripped, fell of the stage, cracked her head, and splashed blood.... then a couple just made out. Completely messed up.

 That's cuz he's lazy and he knows it. 




 I would like us to form a unique bond with this subreddit: /r/april30th2016 




 Spiritually :( 




 No :) 




 Go get girls. 




 "Junji" actually means "David" in English :) 




 Honestly, you turned me on... *blushing* 




 Big disaster now awaits. 




 Why? It's hot. 




 This reminds me of how I never got to say my last words to the girl I liked back in 8th grade. 




 It's /u/thebutton... everyone bow down to your pressiah. 




 It died in distress :'( 




 Imagine...

 Oh :( it didn't come out right... it should have looked like [this](http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/1t4bjB50bisNhjPncJjb90H0zj8QLPil-hK91OFrscI.png)

 [Hey, what do you think of this? ;-)](http://codepen.io/KyleDavidE/full/db9944cf20d7b10be3fbf0894cf888f7/) 




 moo

Obligatory first moo here. 




 Nah...[do you?](http://codepen.io/KyleDavidE/full/db9944cf20d7b10be3fbf0894cf888f7/) 









 What is this 2nd new site that seems to be an altered version of www.973-eht-namuh-973.com? It seems identical at first, but then you notice something different.... check out www.973whiterabbitz973.com 




 Yeah... 




 Oh yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 




 /r/thebutton 




 What do you think about this website?

www.973whiterabbitz973.com 




 Ok :) 




 1. www.973whiterabbitz973.com

2. /r/f04cb41f154db2f05a4a 




 I'll try.... hopefully someone hasn't beaten me to it already... lol 




 Oh no... they beat me to it :( 




 {X'-D 




 I have nothing to do with the girl. 




 Ya can't comparRre rRreal life with er game. 




 I AM NOT 




 {:'-D 




 I'd refuse even if it was the real thing. 




 No....... it was me. DOOT DOOT. 




 Physics, eh? 




 NO 




 Holy cow! :) 




 Maybe I should make a whole subreddit on just him! 




 Because we must resist. 




 So now what? :) 




 But you have to be gray first :) 




 Yeah, I know... his name is Satan... but I'll never press :) 




 CONFIRMED 




 [Just please take a quick look at this... especially Index 5... this website holds deep knowledge, not just mess.](http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/coloured%20site/start/evokation/indices.htm) 




 I am now legitimately afraid for my safety 




 Most people are scared by this website... very few like us aren't. Go deeper into the website... and things will change(the website is far larger than just those few small pages). 




 Try clicking the word "maze" 




 You are right, my friend.

/r/april30th2016 




 Plz don't press, please... 




 No fair :( I wanna drown there! 
























 I'm a cow. 





























 Been through that too... it's horrible, eh? Oh, and then there's this demon... horrible. 




 Mr. Skeltal and his skeletons are not the true enemy! They are simply trying to protect us against the fuccboy helicopters and their leader... the giant bi-gender non-virgin infant! 




 Wow thanks!! I had been looking all over the internet to find out who he was! 




 You're back to the soft posts, eh? 




 LOL! 




 Thank you! 




 :') 




 /u/trollabot train_subject687 









 I don't know, I just came because I remember when 20141220 was here and the whole 4/30/15 thingy. 




 The *subreddit* is following you?? 




 Oh yeah... that feels great. 









 Yes, lets do it. 




 It's your fault for having so many alts. How do I know it's you so I can avoid you? 




 I love bimbos. 




 [please help us](http://www.reddit.com/r/f04cb41f154db2f05a4a/comments/115niq/1349729397/) 




 But like what sort of things do we do? I don't know much about it :) 




 Pepperozzoki 




 The eggroll goes into their delicious flower... but it doesn't belong to them :) 




 Cool 




 Ye miss'd me m8! HarRrdee harRr harRr!! ;-) 




 Dedal Josesito 




 Yeah, it's just a short excerpt, but the full thing is a whole book! 
























 Nope, I like them. 









 Note that most pictures in the website are in the format:


    http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/[specific number].jpg


By replacing the **[specific number]** with a number like 2, 4, 15, etc., you will be taken to another picture in the website.


**NOTE:** Some numbers like 1, 3, 16, 17, 18, 19, etc., will lead you to pages like [this](http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/1.jpg) because not every number has its own picture. Try other higher numbers like 31, 33, etc. 









 Maybe... 




 Oh no :) 














 ...then they go down. 









 "...All this was a long time ago, I remember,

And I would do it again, but set down

This set down

This: were we led all that way for

Birth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly,

We had evidence and no doubt. I had seen birth and

death,

But had thought they were different; this Birth was

Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.

We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,

But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,

With an alien people clutching their gods.

I should be glad of another death." 




 Resist 




 How do you know?  



















 Oh yes 




 I feel that way about the SAT.

/r/nomoresat 




 But the flair looks nice(pun not intended). 




 Oooops, I typed it wwrong! 




 Pressers gather, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no color, hold no flair, flaunt no number. I shall wear no zero and win no karma. I shall live and die at my post. I am the cursor in the darkness. I am the watcher on the Web. I am the grey that shields against the color, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the moderators, the shield that guards the realms of white flairs. I pledge my life and honor to the Grey's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.

If it turns out the way it's going at this rate, it may reach below 35% by the end of the day, then go back up tomorrow!

**EDIT:** BRLI is probably gonna be going back up now(2:25), based on it's graph pattern and that change in direction it made a few minutes ago. 




 [Mine can't fit.](http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/fJMTlg4hv21XZvC-sJGS0Up1sQoxlTq7f9guxV9FlyI.png) 




 Do you know 20141220? 




 Great point... girls don't have peniises... 




 [They scream.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fcr6rWdijY) 




 That would probably make our flair dark gray or black! The rarest flair yet!

 Agreed. 




 I've been here since day 1... refusing to press.
