 I don't get it. The name of the article you cited is "Russian stocks are a best buy amid global turmoil."

Yes, over the past couple/few weeks Russian stocks have declined. Big deal. The Russian government runs a trade surplus and relies much more on resource extraction than it does its stock market. Given the massive deals with China over the past couple of years -- deals that will take a few years to really kick in and pay off -- the article's headline undermines your point.

I think /u/right-again is dead-on with his analysis. And his #1 assumes that Iran is willing to play Washington's game. Iran has a long history with the US and has many valid reasons not to trust the US. Iran is not immune to economics, but they're also not eager to benefit the US unless the payoff for Iran is *huge.*

And with China being the new, big and growing player on the world's economic stage, I'd say Iran would be much eager to fully embrace China's Eurasian "Silk Road" ideas than Iran would be to do deals that would benefit "the Great Satan" and continue our hegemony over Europe. 









 Wikileaks revealed documents which outlined the US started a "regime change" operation a couple of years before people started opposing Gaddafi and the US/NATO sought the no-fly zone and started the war.

 Benghazi was a symptom of bad intelligence and planning.

Simply karma coming back to bite. Blowback from US skulduggery is common and should be expected. 




 While possible, I don't think this can be blamed generically on corporations.

To me this is just an example of someone/some people using our plutocratic government to rig laws to make themselves rich. And it would not surprise me at all if the people doing this like to smoke weed (the same concept of some weed dealers opposing legalization) -- it just seems their primary priority is greed rather than justice or the public good. 




 Clearly the problem is he's not pushing it in hard enough -- just force it. That works on all computers, right? 




 I hope Responsible Ohio loses. The plan they advocate is *not* "legalization," it's a sham designed to make the political insiders who are awarded the 10 farms to grow marijuana filthy rich.

And home growers have to pay $50 for a license to grow 4 plants? 4 plants is absurd. That means the vast majority of home growers will still be subject to arrest and raids by the police.

This petition should be defeated and die. Ohioans should be demanding *full* legalization or some semi-sensible half-step like Colorado has. 




 Because it actually doesn't legalize marijuana.

It sets up a limited cartel (or monopoly) to produce weed to generate tax money for the state. The insiders that get one of the 10 allowed farms will become filthy rich.

It allows home growers to grow only 4 plants -- thus making the vast majority of home growers still subject to raids and arrests by local police.

In short, it's an abomination. It's not even a half-step when people should be demanding full, unfettered legalization. 




 To *deter* China...

Ahh yes, despite having no modern history of being an imperialist country, after centuries of lying low those dastardly Chinese are preparing to *pounce!*

Those petty artificial islands China, Vietnam and the Philippines have been building are the key!

China has no doubt lusted about taking over the Philippines and seizing that key [copra](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/copra?s=t)-producing country.

And Vietnam? Vietnam will be *easy* to take over -- a piece of cake! And just think of all the low-quality, farm-raised fish the Chinese will enjoy then!

Those Chinese are diabolical! Diabolical I tell you!

 "In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares." -- [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3755686.stm) documentary "[The Power of Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Power+of+Nightmares)"  




  The Netherlands aren't the US's puppy

We have a fundamental disagreement right there. *All* NATO countries are US vassal states. We give them the appearance of independence, and we give them the freedom to disagree on various minor issues. But when push comes to shove, NATO countries are satellites -- they follow US orders.

For a recent example, we only have to see the cowardly response to the US' spying on some NATO countries' national leaders. Were those responses the reactions of sovereign, independent countries? Of course not.

If we go back to the 1980s we saw the CIA and its European stooges wage outright terrorist attacks -- bombings and murders -- on our own NATO allies. This was a "[strategy of tension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio#Daniele_Ganser_and_.22Strategy_of_Tension.22)" to push NATO countries to the political right and thus support Reagan's confrontational Cold War arms buildup against the USSR. Just like the vassal states they are, despite finding they were attacked by US, the EU and NATO states did nothing. In this way it's exactly similar to the more recent crimes (kidnappings, torture) committed by the US in the so-called "war on terror" -- European countries do nothing except offer up some nationalistic PR rhetoric.

These are not the actions of independent countries. These are the actions of governments cooperating with the US and offering up nationalistic rhetoric to placate their local populations. In the MH-17 case NATO countries are just creating a PR "echo chamber" to create an appearance of international support for the US narrative. 




  Whats the goal?

Uh-oh. That's a deep question. Hope you're ready for a long answer. :) I'll try to make it worth reading...

It's the same goal the US has had all through the Cold War, or for that fact, that the British Empire had since the 1850s Crimean War: The breakup and/or *control* of Russia and its economy.

The US has adopted the same view of Russia that the British Empire had -- that Russia is the key to control of Eurasia and that Ukraine is fundamental to Russia. High-level US geo-political/national security strategist [Zbigniew Brzezinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski) outlines this thinking clearly in his famous book "[The Grand Chessboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Chessboard)."

The US government has bluntly stated its goal. For example, US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz famously wrote in official documents in the 1990s that "Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union." The US put this into its official doctrine of "full spectrum dominance" and the US Congress openly debated a bill called the "Silk Road Strategy" during the 1990s which advocated that the US establish hegemony in the Caspian Sea and central Asia, replacing centuries of Russian influence there.

When looked at from a geo-political perspective, US actions around the world are clear -- and like I said above, we've bluntly and honestly have stated them. We are seeking to control the entire Middle East and have nothing there but US vassal/client states. Jimmy Carter first laid claim to the Middle East in his late-1970s "Carter Doctrine." Carter was able to bribe and take control of Egypt, but US progress there was slow until we invaded Iraq, the key country in the heart of the Middle East. (These large geo-political strategies typically take decades to implement.)

And we invaded Afghanistan, a required country if we want to get Caspian Sea and central Asian energy supplies out to Pakistani ports, and we started the process of establishing US hegemony in various central Asian *stan countries.

Since as Brzezinski and *many* others have long felt Ukraine is a key to Russia, we poured money into Ukraine to fund dissidents and win people's affections, and we have overthrown the Ukrainian government *twice* in the past 10 years. We don't really care if the new government in Ukraine is backed by neo-Nazis and nationalists, as long as they hate Russians and want to to join the US-western alliance. We'd prefer that Ukraine would be run by liberal neo-democrats, but as we see all over the world, the US government doesn't hesitate to work with outright fascists and dictators.

The bottom line is the US is trying to take over the world. We don't want *independent* countries. We want countries that will follow US orders on major issues. Countries like Russia, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, and now China do not follow US orders sufficiently, so they are demonized and are set up for "regime change" or breakup.

The problem for the US is that many in our government are only semi-competent and that the world is increasingly opposed to US wars and our geo-political skulduggery. Plus -- and this is a *big* plus -- the debt from our wars and our weakening economy puts the US in an increasingly weak position to carry on our global conquests and wars.

 "I get the feeling that no matter what the Americans touch, they end up with Libya or Iraq." -- Russian President Vladimir Putin. 




 Why is it Russian propaganda -- because it does not parrot the narrative coming from the US government? Because the author *dares* to draw an analogy to and remind us of other US government snap judgments and lies to the world? Seriously.

The author is an American, an award-winning journalist who broke key stories about international crimes committed by the Reagan administration. His sources are the typical "unnamed sources" used by most reporting of this type, but his sources seem to be mostly American intelligence sources.

So why exactly are you claiming this is "Russian propaganda"? Because my take on your comment is that you're just smearing the guy with an ad hominem attack simply because he is not sticking to the narrative laid down by the US government and our NATO vassal states. 




 Chomsky is not some sort of mythical all-knowing demi-god, but sometimes he cuts to the chase and speaks the plain, blunt truth in such a way that shocks us and makes us think we're stupid because we never thought of it that way.

Once upon a time I was a tenure-track compsci professor. That experience thoroughly disgusted me about higher education. Teaching at public and even private schools was *far* more honest and honorable in comparison. In public schools grades are basically honest and may only *sometimes* be based on who your parents are or if the teacher likes you or not. At the post-secondary level, grades revolved around financial aid.

For example, the grade of "D" was essentially eliminated. I had to have a very, very, very good reason to flunk a student. The reason? Because financial aid required the student to maintain a "C" average. Though state institutions and non-profit, the administrations understand who is paying the bills -- the federal government via financial aid. And those non-profit institutions subtly/tactfully changed to reflect the fiscal reality.

What sickened me was to see the system up close. As a veteran, I could not help but to see the analogy to military recruiters/salesmen lying to clueless teens to get them to join the military -- the system was that corrupt and dishonest. It simply is a way of preying on the young and inexperienced.

The system of allowing clueless young college students to rent absurdly expensive off-campus apartments with student loans paying for them was insane. Students routinely got "kickbacks" of student loan money to go on Caribbean vacations -- again, all rolled up on student loans. I knew those students were hanging themselves, but the entire system is corrupt. It seems to me to be designed to make banks rich with risk-free loans via saddling students with debt peonage/bondage. Chomsky's quote offers another angle of discipline.

An aside: When I lived in Germany I was shocked that Germans gave young people an *even* *longer* period of time for paid vacations than older workers. The Germans' thought was that they're young and carefree, they should enjoy life, and there will be plenty of time for them to work their asses off when they're 30-something and have kids. I thought that was a nice attitude.

Here in the US we see things differently. We see young people as clueless and merely as people to screw over and exploit extra hard. 




 Feel free to copy and post it there if you want.

My guess is that it would be downvoted into oblivion because it (a) goes against mainstream thinking, and (b) raises fundamental/systemic issues of equality and justice.

Seriously, give it a try and see if my guess is right...

**Edit:** And (c) there are a lot of Reddit users from the UK. With UK people indoctrinated from birth to have deference to the monarchy, any question of the legitimacy/logic of the monarchy is akin to asking an American about the legitimacy/necessity of wars waged by the US or the amount of US defense[sic] spending. 




 Headline translation: "They consistently say things we don't like. So we're plugging our ears and are loudly saying 'Nyah, nyah, nyah' as we try to ignore them. And since we're the WASHINGTON POST, you should do the same thing." 




 Ignoring the Bellamy salute, for the life of me, I cannot figure out why the British people (and the other nations with royal families) still tolerate having a monarch be officially in charge of their country.

Sure, it might have made sense in the centuries after the Roman Empire fell when the King was the guy with the most lethal army and the people did not have much of a choice in who their leader was.

But in the 21st century?! The idea that some person gets to be the titular "leader" because of raw luck of birth is an insult to the idea of democracy and equality.

Is it celebrity worship that keeps the monarchy in power? (That seems to be why the US corporate mass media is so fascinated by reporting about the "royals".) Is it too many stories about Frozen princesses for children? Like the lottery, a way to keep people distracted and dreaming of a better life?

Seriously, why would people support such an immoral concept in the 21st century? 




 The 2nd Amendment does *nothing* to stop the government from spying on us or from trashing the Bill of Rights, and it certainly does not help to stop the epidemic of police murders and police brutality that goes on from coast to coast.

If you think that civilians with AR-15s, pistols and hunting rifles can take on the combined might of the US military and police, you're nuts. The 2nd Amendment is doing *nothing* to stop government tyranny -- in fact, it does the opposite.

The 2nd Amendment is what the government uses to justify the militarization and heavily arming of the police. *That* and to ensure we have a sky-high murder rate is the 2nd Amendment's only real purpose.

 and make it illegal for cops to carry any sort of firearm. Batons only, 

This is the key. We are *long* overdue to disarm the police. No more firearms, no more torture tech toys (e.g. tasers) to inflict punishment on the population. We need to disarm and to decentralize the police. 




 Just don't call things like this "political assassinations" or imply that it is any sort of political persecution/suppression.

After all, we live in the "land of the free" where we rights and a government "of the people" all that good rot.

/s 




 It's that way almost everywhere. This is just a sales line urging schools to chase the taillights of the tech industry and to waste a lot of money on new tech toys to "revolutionize education."

Tech companies *love* using this line as it results not only in a never-fulfilled promise of better schools, but in lots and lots of sales to clueless schools who are then distracted from their primary mission and who cannot afford to implement, retrain and support the new technology.

As soon as the next/new superintendent or technology director comes in, the projects are then scrapped and the cycle of buying the "next new high tech system to revolutionize education" starts all over again.

**Edit:** And what is the source of the "study" that reported these "shocking" findings? Some teacher working on their dissertation or doing a thesis project for their master's degree? A government agency perhaps?

No, it's a "study" from a technology company. I'd call the entire article nothing but generic commercial spam. 




 Is anyone actually surprised by this?

Capitalists own *both* halves of our ruling political duopoly, including Congress *and* the White House.

 "And the banks - hard to believe in a time when we're facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created - are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they frankly own the place." -- Illinois Sen. Richard Durbin, May 8, 2009. 




 Probably?!

Oh, I get it -- you're leaving room for a minor slap on the wrist. Smart call. 




 A tax break? Wouldn't we apply that $4.5b drop-in-the-bucket to our massive annual budget deficit? Or have we given up on that and decided to just let banksters and the rich take over and we just make Treasury bond payments? 




  Definition: "US foreign aid": When you take money from the poor people of a rich country and give it to the rich people of a poor country.

Since Israel isn't really a poor country it doesn't completely apply. But you get the gist of it. 




  There would be no war in Eastern Ukraine if Russia did not invade the country.

My guess is that Russia is supplying weapons and support, volunteers, and perhaps some specialist troops, but it's far from what anyone can call an "invasion". And again, Putin makes a valid point when he says he could easily take over the country if he wanted to.

 And if you honestly believe that story about how Crimea was taken over,

Yes, I followed the events pretty closely from multiple sources. Are you saying the Crimean parliament did *not* do those things? Are you saying the Crimean peoples are marching in the streets in opposition to reunification with Russia?

Or are Crimeans *thankful* because they're better off, more free, and they're not going to have to endure the austerity that the EU will now inflict on the Ukrainian people?

 and if you honestly think that the US overthrew the Ukrainian government twice (especially in 2004. Dude, are you kidding me?),

As one of our diplomats bragged, we spent $5 *billion* in Ukraine since the 1990s. The US government does not spend that kind of money on nothing.

We have a long history of overthrowing governments all across the world -- we've done it *many* times since WWII. We are *experts* at funding dissidents and protesters, manipulating internal grievances in a country, and overthrowing governments with so-called "colored revolutions." Ukraine's 2 coups just examples of our skulduggery. 




  The Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine seem to suggest otherwise.

If there are Russian forces in Ukraine, there's not very many of them. And the act they're doing is to stop Ukraine from slaughtering people in the rebellious eastern provinces.

Putin was correct when he said he could take Ukraine in a couple of weeks if he wanted to. *Obviously* he does not want to.

  So did the ones who invaded Crimea.

Crimea wasn't invaded. Let's honestly look at what happened: Crimea tried to become independent in the 1990s but Ukraine refused and instead made Crimea an autonomous republic with their own parliament.

When the US/west overthrew the elected government (the 2nd time in 10 years) of Ukraine last year, the Crimean parliament voted to secede. The Crimean parliament then voted to *re-*join Russia, and then a referendum was held in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans opted to *re-*join Russia.

What is to complain about in the Crimean scenario? That Putin played fast and loose by using Russian troops in Crimea -- troops which were allowed to be in Crimea under a treaty with Ukraine -- to ensure that there was not the same chaos and murder that we saw in Kiev or Odessa?

Crimea has been Russian for longer than Texas has been American. Crimeans opted to re-join a country with a much higher standard of living and a far better social safety net -- from a selfish perspective, the Crimean decision was easy.

Crimeans today enjoy 3 official languages -- Russian, Ukrainian and Tartar. Contrast that to Ukraine. In Ukraine roughly 1/2 of the country speaks Russian in their homes. Yet the only official language in Ukraine is Ukrainian. Why would Crimeans want to go back to being part of poor, bankrupt Ukraine which doesn't allow them the freedom to speak the languages they want to speak?

When looked at objectively, the Russian *reunification* with Crimea was *much* more democratic than the US overthrow of the Hawaiian government and our subsequent takeover of Hawaii.

Since Crimeans seem quite happy about their present situation, who the hell are we to complain about their status? 




 The article makes good points.

We don't want to admit is that the Obama administration pulled the trigger on a war based on lies and propaganda to overthrow the Libyan dictatorship. The war was just as evil as our war on Iraq.

The key difference is that we did not kill as many people and we did not put thousands of ground troops into Libya -- only a small number to direct air strikes. Most of our ground fighting was done using Muslim fundamentalist proxy forces just like when we allied with Muslim fundamentalists to attack Afghanistan during the Carter and Reagan administrations.

But we "won," right?

We succeeded in overthrowing a dictator and turning the African country with the highest life expectancy into a feuding hellhole. The Libyan people lost -- big-time!

Yay Hillary and Obama! Yay USA! :(

 "I get the feeling that no matter what the Americans touch, they end up with Libya or Iraq." -- Russian President Vladimir Putin. 




 While the condition that no inspectors can be American because of the crimes, spying and skulduggery that American inspectors committed against Iraq during the 1990s is logical, Iran is not stupid. Iran *has* *to* know that to trust Germans or Canadians or other NATO members' inspectors would be foolish. Those countries are our vassal states, and even non-NATO inspectors can be bought off.

Still, since the US forced Iran to accept inspectors, compromises had to be made I suppose. 




 No country has invaded Ukraine. We've overthrown their elected government a couple of times in the past decade, but no one's invaded them. 




 He's rich, so it's okay. In the US the rich get to steal from the poor and especially from the government.

Just ask Eric Holder or some of the many banksters that he and the government refused to prosecute.

 "Theres class warfare, all right, but its my class, the rich class, thats making war, and were winning." -- Warren Buffett, the 2nd richest man in the world. 




  are we saying that there is no problem with Russia taking control of parts of Ukraine?

Crimea tried to become independent in the 1990s but Ukraine refused and instead made them an autonomous republic with their own parliament.

When the US/west overthrew the elected government (the 2nd time in 10 years) of Ukraine last year, the Crimean parliament voted to secede. The Crimean parliament then voted to rejoin Russia, and then a referendum was held in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans opted to *re-*join Russia.

What is to complain about in the Crimean scenario? That Putin played fast and loose by using Russian troops which were allowed to be in Crimea under a treaty with Ukraine to ensure that there was not the same chaos and murder that we saw in Kiev or Odessa?

For Crimeans it was a simple decision. Crimea has been Russian for longer than Texas has been American. Crimeans opted to re-join a country with a much higher standard of living and a far better social safety net -- from a selfish perspective, the Crimean decision was easy.

Crimeans today enjoy 3 official languages -- Russian, Ukrainian and Tartar. Contrast that to Ukraine. In Ukraine roughly 1/2 of the country speaks Russian in their homes. Yet the only official language in Ukraine is Ukrainian.

Since Crimeans seem quite happy about their present situation, who the hell are we to complain about their status? 




 Well, it seems like it should be in either the Entertainment or the Finance section. Trump seems pretty good at making money off being a celebrity -- Sarah Palin could learn *so* much from him... 




 The decline of what Americans would call our normal or traditional civil liberties since 9/11 is stark and dramatic.

This has been going on slowly for years, but 9/11 kicked the decline into overdrive. And Americans are protesting/reacting to this change in many seemingly strange ways -- like the guy in this video getting himself arrested.

For example, a huge part of the pro-gun movement is due to the suppression of civil liberties (along with the police brutality and murders that are routine here). Many -- even many Americans -- find it bizarre that one reaction is the "open carry" movement to carry guns everywhere.

I mean really, what would your reaction be to some guy on a street corner in Rotterdam with an assault rifle slung over his back or a pistol strapped to his hip?

Here that is a form of protest against the government's suppression of civil liberties. And I'd also say that a good chunk of the attention given to things like this sub-reddit is also due to the suppression of civil liberties that is going on in addition to the police violence.

We in the US don't have political parties nearly as strong as in Europe, and people here are probably more isolated (belong to fewer clubs or social groups, etc.) so many are groping at different/odd ways to express their outrage at the suppression of civil liberties. 




  Where I live (Netherlands) I can't leave my house without papers, and we are obliged to be able to identify ourselves at all times.

I'm sorry to hear that.

 Is this different in the USA?

Very different, but first some background.

The phrase "Papers please" and asking for a person's papers was used for decades as an illustration of totalitarian or police state rule -- the idea that common citizens were somehow beholden or held some sort of responsibility towards the police, and that the police were above innocent citizens.

For example, in many movies and TV shows Nazis would be seen asking the resistance fighter or innocent person for their papers -- and that was considered a form of tyranny. Anyone over a certain age has seen those sorts of movies and has had the idea ingrained into them. Many in the US still take their civil liberties seriously, despite the bi-partisan moves in recent years to roll them back.

Here in the US (all states? most states?) it is illegal for police to ask someone for ID unless that person committed some form of crime. That's the focus of this video, a guy doing nothing wrong but being asked for his ID and then being wrongfully arrested. 




 Hey, Ronnie already had a very warm relationship with the Iranians!

That relationship started when him and George committed treason and made the "[October](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3862.htm)_[Surprise](https://consortiumnews.com/archive/xfile.html)" deal with Iran to keep the American diplomats held hostage by the Iranians to prevent Carter from freeing them before the election. 




 How to finish her education? 

Student loan debt peonage honey -- you're going to be living in debt like the vast majority of college students do and working for years to pay off banksters...with interest.

 "Students who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society. When you trap people in a system of debt they can't afford the time to think. Tuition fee increases are a disciplinary technique, and by the time students graduate, they are not only laded with debt, but have also internalized the disciplinarian culture. This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy." -- Noam Chomsky. 




 Terrorism is the new buzzword used to smear people brave enough to respond to US wars and crimes. The core of the issue is that we expect to wage endless wars, slaughter people and attack other countries but to have no one dare to counter-attack and harm US soldiers.

We saw this in the US persecution/prosecution of 15-year old [Omar Khadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khadr) fighting in Afghanistan. Khadr was fighting for the Taliban as a low-level grunt soldier long before 9/11. When the US refused the turnover of Osama Bin Laden and instead chose war and to invade Afghanistan, Khadr continued to fight for the Taliban. In a firefight with US Marines he was accused of throwing a hand grenade that killed a US Marine.

Guess what? That's what soldiers do in a war. They shoot at each other and try to blow each other up.

But was Khadr treated like a POW? Or even a "child soldier"? No, we was sent off to be tortured in Gitmo for years.

It's sad that the Marines in Tennessee died. But those Marines are members of a military engaged in unapologetic torture and wars of aggression. Those Marines *volunteered* for that military. As one old book I read said, live by the sword, die by the sword. May those Marines rest in peace -- and may our criminal government end its many wars and stop trying to take over the world. 




  i think that's part of the definition of terrorism.

No, that's part of the definition of *war.* Soldiers of an army engaged in wars should expect to be shot at and perhaps killed.

This is what we don't seem to get. We want to pretend that our soldiers are some sort of mythical Greek gods and should be immune to harm by others, no matter how many countries we attack or people we slaughter.

We saw this in our attitude about the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon. Sorry, but if we can bomb radio and TV stations in other countries, bomb water treatment plants and factories, etc., etc., and call them "legitimate military targets," then most certainly the Pentagon is a valid target for destruction by others.
