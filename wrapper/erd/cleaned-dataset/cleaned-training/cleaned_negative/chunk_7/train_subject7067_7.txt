 Wow that's crazy, the dark hair on hair made my boner for her even harder, as a blonde i find her closer to natalie's scale of attractiveness, which is only a few notches below dark-hair emilia.   




 Damn beauty is in the eye of the beholder...natalie is definitely not as visually pleasing as Emilia, it might be natalie's annoying face. 




 I actually take very nice videos at festivals, OP probably records vertical. 




 Used to love Coke, then high-school buddy got diabetes, could only drink Diet Coke, and ever since I became a Diet Coke drinker, I LOVE the taste.  I'm sure there were better ways, but a nice Diet Coke was a great way to keep my ass going to the gym and dieting properly.  I guess I used it as a tiny reward, although I can say anecdotally that Diet Coke probably does more harm to my body than good, it's just what my body tells me. 

Doesn't matter if I'm in skinny or chubby mode, Diet Coke all day every day, I'll probably get cancer. 




 whine much?  i think you just need to git gud.

 my are you dense. 




 No way is this guy NVE 2.0.  Doesn't got that swagger, remember Nick the Quick sticking up for young Kobe?  Guy doesn't fuck around, just ask that ref he pummeled.
