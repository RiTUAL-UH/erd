 No, every dual enrollment student that finishes their degree at valencia automatically gets accepted to UCF and I think a few other florida schools. 




 What's that? 




 Yah, I'm thinking either Computer Science or Math. 




 That is exactly why I was asking. There is this program that will allow me to be automatically accepted to UCF after I graduate as a Junior but I wasn't sure if the schools I actually wanted to go to would let me do the same. 




 Thanks, I think that is what is probably going to happen to me.
