 Thanks, forgot about checking the Criterion! 




 Thanks, I used to watch death note when I was younger (15/16), and I don't mind gore, so I'll be sure to look up Living Hell and Battle Royale. 

I've never watched foreign comedies, does the humour translate well over subs? Or would it be best to search for a dubbed version?
