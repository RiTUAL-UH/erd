 Copper tips are plated with iron.  Once the coating is breached, the copper will start to dissolve into the solder and you will get pitting and crummy solder joints.   Instead of wet sponge use metal pot scrubber. It eliminates thermal shock that fatigues the plating.  Also when dismantling stuff do not use the tip as a crow bar.

 The only hint I can give you is to bias the coil with a small strong magnet. 




 That circuit would not work.  The page says "A simple 1kW or so resistor, 9 to 15 volts, ..."  Typo - use 1K Ohm resistor and connect it to + on the mike.  To the same point (+) connect the cap.  The other end of resistor goes to +9 to 15V.  The other end of the cap is the audio out.  - on the mike and power is your common ground.

 Your load (radio) is of dynamic nature.  It may take maximum 250mA when turned up full at much less at lower levels.  In other words it will behave like a variable resistor, with the signal content being the variant.
You need a constant voltage source - three terminal voltage regulator.
