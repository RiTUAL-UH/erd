 Thanks for the shout out, Merica!

Oh man...who would I choose for my actors? Honestly, they probably wouldn't be big name actors. Lee I've always pictured as Alexander Skarsgard, probably because of his role on the HBO series Generation Kill (great book and show, btw). But the others I really never came up with casting wish lists for. 




 Well, that depends on your definition of "kid." When I was too young to read for myself, my pops would read Lord of the Rings to us kids. Which was awesome. When I learned to read, I thought Bunnicula was amazing. And I still do.

Then, when I actually got into adult books, I devoured anything by Dean Koontz. Then I had a Chuck Palahniuk phase. Still think those are all great books. Hard to choose a favorite among them though.

I wasn't allowed to watch TV as a kid. So...that was probably why I loved reading! 




 No rest for the wicked, brotha. I quit my job, so it's write or die now! I got a stand-alone book out being shopped, and I'm working on part one of three of a new series.

Thanks for reading!
