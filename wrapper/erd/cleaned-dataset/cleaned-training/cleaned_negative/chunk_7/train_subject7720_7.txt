 i would disagree, wizards already puts out the basis for magic the gathering as an animated property with its set trailers,  animated does not necessarily mean for children,  look how clone wars is done or avatar,  you can have serious themes like war and politics with humor and it still be an amazing show.  that being said magic's already expansive cast of characters would be amazing on screen, plus planeswalker action figures 




 i was thinking more along the lines of a show based on the lore of the game as opposed to the game itself 




 So i was watching the mtg set trailers, and it made me want a magic cartoon series soooo badly.  does anyone else want one as well? 




 do yo think that there could be a viable t.v. series of fear street marketed to the older teen aged crowd?  ghosts of fear street is still my favorite series of books to this day 




 again when ours were opened i saw two u/b walkers come from the same pack and several other instances of random in the seed pack,  mine was random 




 saw one opened not two hours ago and a r/g pw and elspeth in it 




 those of you opening the pre-re packs they are random not predetermined like previously thought 




 its an animated short that feels very much like D d and its silent, i saw it posted here before but i cant remember the name 




 actually i do classic enchantress g/w with armadillo cloak and ancestral masks 














 i think he is a free agent
