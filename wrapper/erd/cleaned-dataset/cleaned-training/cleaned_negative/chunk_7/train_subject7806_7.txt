 Nice and clean! try 1Sheeld to move it with your smartphone. 




 Good catch, still pretty awesome though! 














 Thanks but like you said, pricey!  




 Thanks, but i was looking for someone who sells these kits, I wanna buy 10 kits for a school project. 



















 Nice, I got used to the Spark Core though. 














 Thanks! It is actually without an ethernet shield or a PC, I used [1Sheeld](https://1Sheeld.com) which gets the internet from my smart phone.
