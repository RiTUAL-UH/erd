 He's already ditched his headband, remember how long that took?  




 Would you happen to have a GIF from the side view as well as the top?  




 Wow, only one service member would draw BAH, hopefully they took that into account with regards to eventually making the military cover 5%, I doubt it. Some of the figures mentioned losing at least $1,000 a month.  




 Trying to get a visual of how the pulley system works with regards to the double rounds.  




 Is there a video that shows the mechanism firing with the dual shots. Like this video but with the dual firing mechanism. All I saw was one round being loaded.

 Those services seem unqualified to constitute as ABA. I would not advise that, our insurance only authorizes services from approved providers, I'd be flabbergasted if any place like that was authorized for services.  




 Wow that's outrageous, I've never heard of any of that before. ABA is just play based therapy, I agree you have to keep aware and make the sure the place has good reviews and recommend by other parents.  




 Hmm, interesting I've not seen that in ABA therapy. Stimming is fine we all do it, like when we tap our feet, twiddle our thumbs.  




 39 States now have mandates to provide these services if employees are on a certain plan. Virginia is on that list but not sure if that plan would cover it. I agree with /u/cakeisatruth that ABA is not the only way but has been found to be beneficial by the U.S. government take that as you may. Additionally, Temple Grandin has came out and said that ABA is beneficial but the more important part is finding what your child loves and use that as a motivator. I have noticed that when therapy is provided that is what happens during ABA. Speech, and occupational therapy are added benefits and will compound those self life skills. I'd be more interested in reading /u/cakeisatruth comment about masking their symptoms and making children seem more neurotypical.

 I didn't like this last episode of Person of Interest, just left it at blah.

 David will be missed by the masses, a cultural icon.  




 I'm interested to see how Dwight settles in as the series goes along. Steph on the other hand seems like he's on autopilot. Should be a great series.  




 Sounds like a good idea.  




 My son is starting to act like a neuro typical so the future is bright you'll see.  




 My son seems to enjoy it, play based therapy. He's been there not being able to sleep at night, he kind of just grew out of it. We try and get him outside for physical exercise so he's a little worn out and seems to work as he's tired. Youll be glad with the ABA therapy, some days your child will surprise you as they grow is worth it. Your doing this right by staying young and ensuring independence as an adult.  




 History repeats itself, good graphic.  




 That is pretty cool.  




 Interesting.  




 What gets me is how can going to the casino and charging to the taxpayers constitute as official business.   




 Does this help Kobe?  




 Does anyone have the 1-5 breakdown.   




 True.  




 Surprised more people don't join if they knew the simplicity of it.

 Not sure what that means but that was a nice tweet regarding the situation with Goodell. Mike Tyson boxing.  




 Be ready for liquid diet and a lot of pain but you'll be glad their out.

 Congress does have Patriots fans in their inner circle.  




 I wouldn't be surprised if Olivia Pope was in these negotiations.

 Once you go Patriots you never go back!!  




 In Bill and Tom we trust.  




 [AT T isn't really going that far though, at least not yet. Industry sources tell The Verge that AT T will continue to offer two-year contracts in its own stores and online, so it's not a coup de grce for consumers. And even if AT T killed contracts, programs like AT T Next are sort of like contracts by a different name  they're still expensive commitments.] (http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/19/8625985/attt-two-year-contract)

 Tried it, just another extension for feedly which still has latency. I think news blur should be ok,  it suggests real time updates.  




 I only see a list of times it will re-air. http://m.bleacherreport.com/articles/2465404-iverson-preview-and-tv-schedule-for-showtime-documentary 




 I meant redditors find these articles before these large media agencies such as ESPN, as well as have some great discussions which prompts news stories to be written, if that makes sense?  




 I think I'll try that out, is there a free trial for the pro version? I have easily 200 subscriptions.  




 You may be able to mark all read and refresh but if the server is not pinging the feeds you won't get any new articles.  




 Is that Mark Madsen?  




 [I still remember him like it was yesterday with that stepback jumper] (http://media2.giphy.com/media/yoJC2p4n5jn9rnjPwY/200w.gif)  




 I have everything as rss but the issue is by the time I read the article its old need sometimes up to 6 hours.  




 Everyone only remembers his practice speech, but he was a fierce competitor at heart.  




 How would I integrate my rss feeds, reddit, and custom Google key word feeds.?  




 http://www.theplayerstribune.com/allen-iverson-video/ 




 Looks like I'm stuck with feedly until something better comes out. Thanks for your help appreciate it.  




 Which feed reader?  




 So far it seems really good, how can I compare palabre and feedly in regards to time latency updating articles?  




 Is it timely in updating?  




 The latency is slow. I like to get an article relatively soon after its published.  




 [replay] (http://www.sbnation.com/2015/5/16/8616099/preakness-stakes-video-replay-2015-american-pharoah?utm_campaign=sbnation utm_content=article%3Atop utm_medium=social utm_source=twitter#)  




 We shall see if the 30+ year drought continues.  




 Is there something similar to inoreader where there is almost no latency but without the high cost? Feedly almost works perfect but the latency can be 120 minutes plus on some subscriptions.  




 In addition to pensions.  




 I would like to witness a triple crown champion, would be amazing.  




 What do you think, will American Pharoah win?  




 No one was really challenged.  




 I exported feedly and would not import into inoreader, how do you do it?  




 Can I export my feedly subscriptions and import into inoreader? Additionally is there a Web version of inoreader so I can read when I don't have my mobile with me? 




 Of course everything is not from reddit.  




 This was just reposted by sbnation, I swear that's the sole job of these sports outlets is to troll reddit.  




 I ran Cape Cod last weekend what a blast.  




 Does it have an rss function?

 Get outside and run, build up your long distance. In the Army requirements are 2 miles but most long distance runners exceed the standard because running 20 to 30 miles a week prepares you for that quick burst 2 miles is a cake walk.  




 Vote for Caitlin and Kenny, you could send us on a trip to run 200 unforgettable miles in the Adirondacks. We're way behind, like 200 votes so we need your help. Voting ends next week.

 Wow then Disney Land wait times are significantly less than its counterpart in Florida.  




 Have you ever been to Disney Land, there is no such thing as getting on other rides with short lines. So you show up to the ride and are given a return time but in the mean time you can't ride anything else as the lines are just as long. Additionally you can't get another return time for a different ride because you still haven't returned for the queue yet. I don't claim to know how Disney Land works but at Disney World most waits times are an hour plus. http://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/wait-times

What is Disability Access Service and how does it work? 
DAS is intended for Guests whose disability prevents them from waiting in a conventional queue 
environment. Once issued at specified Guest Relations locations, DAS can be used to obtain a return 
time for an attraction comparable to the current conventional queue wait time. As soon as a Guest 
finishes one attraction, they can receive a return time for the same or a different attraction.

 Great song.  




 Do I need 4.4.4?

 Purchase a zero lemon case battery you won't regret it, 14 hours of screen time and 48 standby time.  




 Does this work with the Note 3? 




 Not sure the best way to go about it, I guess the way it is seems to not have upset to many people. I guess a study would have to be conducted.  




 Waiting just somewhere else.  




 I still remember Dante with the vikings like it s yesterday. Him throwing to Randy was classic.
