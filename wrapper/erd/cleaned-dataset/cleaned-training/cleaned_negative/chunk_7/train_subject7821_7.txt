 Politics...Gov Bryant is conservative   he's looking to replace Jones with someone he can control. Bryant has exercised some anti-education measures since taking office.  Another example of Bryant being a disgrace to the state of MS. 

Bryant's supporters blame Jones for phasing out all the 'dixie', 'confederate flags',   'Ole Miss' which has been happening for over a decade despite Jones only working for a couple of years. Since taking office, Jones has gotten great support.  




 I'm going to go ahead   call this a shitty employee issue VS Torchy's standard operating procedure  




 Jeebus, I wish my Zune could access this... 




 by a bunch, you mean 2?
 




 There's a Potato / Irish / St Pattys joke in there somewhere but I be damned if I feel like hammering it out... 




 what a god damn shill  




 spoken like a true quitter

 why didn't you just strafe to the right   finish him off? they clearly were spawning in that area...

 For H5, Please let us mount a turret on the side passenger door...  




 Will: Jazzy, have you considered letting Zenu into your life as lord   savior?

Jazzy: Man, you know I can't afford that shit. 




 Scientologists like money  




 I'd like Firefight   also a Flood version...endless waves of Flood would rock 




 Indeed, Halo's own 'zombie' mode... endless rounds of Flood would be crazy fun... 









 because since the 70s, they've been behind a good bit of government tampering. 

because they're responsible for the Boy Scouts not accepting homosexuals   atheist

because, like scientology, it's absolutely made up   followed by a bunch of dupes who don't acknowledge that Joseph Smith was con-man who was run out of several towns (well documented) on his travels West   finally found some marks to buy his bullshit he practically pulled from his ass (hat)... 




 if it kept us in a room together, we'd go straight into another match   therefore speed up the MP process for the user... 

also after a couple of games, we'd have a group of people determined to play   weed out the quitters who ruin the experience.  




 the vimeo version was NSFW... this youtube version is less gory  




 they are probably his mates...

 I'm not worried about nepotism in the White House (families like Clinton, Bush, etc) as much as the behind the scenes cronies who've been pulling strings for decades. 

For example, take Roger Ailes, Cheney,   Rumsfield. They've been involved since the Nixon administration in EVERY republican seat holder. While experienced, they've made careers of getting their way in smokey rooms. Term limits should be applied to these positions.  




 while cool   awesome, the visibility looks limited... 




 SPOILER! 




 If you are looking for a reason not to tip, you probably can justify it...  




 $69.83 would have bought several groceries...  




 yeah, because TWC has the #2 worst customer service reputation next to Comcast's #1...
 




 To be fair, $4440 was labor... 




 besides being on P R, those are THE 2 most famous things about the man... I Literally know nothing else about the man

 Wolfenstein is a great game, no MP,   I wouldn't buy it for more than $20

Sunset Overdrive is an Amazing game, $20 is a steal

yes, $40 for the 2 is worth it 




 to mirror the trilogy, he should appear in the 2nd film...

 dickheads are on the internet...this must be the internet  









 My only question is:

Will it be available to existing DISH network subscribers? 

(looked everywhere for an answer...no confirmation) 




 Yes.. when ODST came out, I felt like this (Flood Firefight) would be great

anyhoo, gameplay video:

 I like how the announcer gets more excited with each medal... 




 shut up Jarvis 




 not really 'in cold blood' when Greedo had a blaster in the man's face
