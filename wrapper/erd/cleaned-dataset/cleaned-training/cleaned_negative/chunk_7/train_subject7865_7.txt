 Back when I was studying for a degree in anthropology (and hence studying evolution), I was astounded by the number of intelligent people who would ask me whether humans had stopped evolving. 







































 Check out the bar/restaurant [Solar](http://www.solarberlin.com/en/) - its hidden away off the main road (you have to access it through the car park next to a carpet shop)  and doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you go in you go on a glass elevator up the side of the building to the top and its really awesome. Amazing city views, cool interior and great food. A bit expensive but totally worth it.

 [This is the press release](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-12/bmj-ian121214.php) it was based on. It's one of the most poorly researched releases I have seen in ages - honestly I have no idea how it got funded.

 How are you going to get it to people? The value in Outernet is its ability to be used by people in remote areas with little infrastructure - sending them all USB sticks would be incredibly expensive and a logistical nightmare.  




 I really like this site - it feels way more unique than most! 




 I would also like to know if anyone has tried it, but bear in mind this is not the full internet - it's a broadcast selection of articles and bits and pieces, so it won't be a replacement for a dastardly service provider.  




 Blocks it on Chrome fine.  









 What did he say? 



















 Yes, but you can use it to print lots of cars, and these machines are going to drop in cost far faster than a traditional automobile.
