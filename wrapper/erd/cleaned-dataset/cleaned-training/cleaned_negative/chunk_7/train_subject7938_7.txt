 I think he means "max the loot" on the storage's. I'm pretty sure that's the highest level of storage's you can have at TH6. 




 And why is there an archer tower in range of your townhall? Just drag it out further otherwise TH7's will get pissed off and 3 star you. If you want a free shield then don't trap your townhall.  




 Just drop trophies and put your loot in the middle.

 I take them outside for 10 minutes, they don't go and then they poop in my room 5 minutes later.

 You look like a TH8 who maxed everything but his walls and a few other things 









 What the (   ) did you just (   )ing say about me, you little (   )? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the (   ) out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my (   )ing words. You think you can get away with saying that (   ) to me over the Internet? Think again, (   )er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre (   )ing dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable (   ) off the face of the continent, you little (   ). If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your (   )ing tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will (   ) fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre (   )ing dead, kiddo.
