 I can catch a cold over a telephone call. I like this. 




 I've already jumped ship back to Firefox. I push the save button and I can't figure out the exact location of where it saved, nor could I change the location of the "save" where I wanted it to go. The big and blocky "manage bookmarks" blows, because I just want simple functions like "edit name" and easy to understand "drag to folder" functions. 




 I got two today. I was excited. I need to get a life. I hope they keep them around. 




 There is always a point when I'm looking through "Mildly Interesting" when I physically laugh out loud because it is the perfect three way intersection of:

1. Me realizing I need to get an actual life. 
2. The mind numbing randomness of this whole subreddit. 
3. Then seeing a great post like this one and saying to myself "hey, that's pretty cool".

And all is right with the universe once again. This was that post. (And the dryness of the title is the trigger).
