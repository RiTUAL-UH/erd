 My understanding was that they weren't happy with the compromise. Is there a source somewhere saying that they supported the compromise? 

 





























 That's what I thought. I've never seen confederate flag merchandise at Walmart. Lots of duck dynasty and camo merchandise though.  




 How will they do that for Lucky Charms and Trix?  














 Remember last fall she defended the flag because "CEOs hadn't complained about it"

 Another Fox hatchet job  

















































 Pretty big deal because last fall she defended the flag because "CEOs hadn't complained about it"

 I guess CEOs complained  



















  I didn't like Jurassic World , the whole thing was predictable  




 Don't give them  any ideas   









 I'm shocked  




 Does the NRA know of the concept called "PR"? Because it seems like they don't.  




 Why did Norway give all of their oil to 'murica ? 




 How did Germany kill Greece?  




 When did he get political? This isn't me defending his political beliefs I'm legitimately curious as to what he has said and how this may have hurt him. There are loads of celebrities that have made political statements and it hasn't hurt them, so why Jim Carrey?  









 Lets be honest he never had a real chance to win the nomination.  












































 nothing of value will be lost  



















 The last one is my favorite 

 




 The recent incident that led to people criticizing the Police: www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2015/06/13/lmpd-shooting-near-3rd-and-oak-streets/71178888/ 





























 But the ban on Men's basketball tourney games taking place there remains.  




 First time a short had me in tears. [The song and tune reminded me of Over the Rainbow by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z26BvHOD_sg)

 




 The NCAA doesn't let any tournament events go on in South Carolina or Mississippi because of their embrace of the confederate flag. This has been official policy since 1999. Since then SC has added major production facilities for BMW and Boeing and just announced a new plant for Volvo (even Mississippi has added a production facility for Toyota), and Gov. Nikki Haley has said that no CEOs have mentioned the flag to her as a problem. I don't see anything changing in the future.  




 It doesn't need to be banned. It just shouldn't be flown on the lawn of the South Carolina legislature. There is too much baggage associated with the flag. If you think it's "southern pride" then fly it on your own property. That flag was flown by traitors who rebelled against the US government. No state should embrace that flag 

[(this applies to Mississippi as well)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mississippi)

Note: Born and raised in Georgia and always associated that flag with racism. 

edit: spelling and grammar.  




 That scene had me laughing because their reactions were hilarious. Leave it to sadness to realize the solution is falling on your face.

 This is exactly why. The $10 bill was up for redesign in 2020 anyway to counteract counterfeiters .

 Reminds me of the guys who did a shot for shot remake of Toy Story with real toys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G0j_Huv2Fg 




 Is there a source for this? I've never heard of this. 

 


































 is there a link for the NE story? I'm interested.  















































































 At this point I've just given up on hoping characters that I like stick around, I've become numb to the death and no longer feel heartbreak when a good character dies.
