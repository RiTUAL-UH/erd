 I'm watching the game here  thinking - Damn, Wade looks like he's playing with Shaq again.  Reminding me of back in 05-06. 




 I can imagine Riley requesting the presence of Whiteside in his office. ...Whiteside walks in. ..Riley sitting in a too cool ambient corner of his office overlooking the city. ..so I heard you want to win. ...clanking his rings on the table. ...the story continues

 I used to change the oil on my jeep because I could get under it.  I'm worried about doing the same to my corolla because I'm afraid if I jack it or won't drain completely because it's uneven.  Is this a rational concern?  




 I would like to see the front office keep him and encourage him to put on some serious muscle this offseason.
