 Why do you allow your subreddit be used to carry out people's personal witch hunts? I have seen happen many times. I have had it happen to me several times. People who want to carry out a grudge, will use your sub as tool to do so. What measures do you implement to stop such abusive tactics. They present flimsy hearsay evidence and pounce on the accused person who has no chance in hell to defend himself.

Or is this just a free-for-all witch hunt subreddit?

 




 Yea all of that is horseshit.

 Nothing. Everyone will think they won then  in a week it will be business as usual. But Reddit will find some one else to brutally attack. 









 Agreed but the reddit mob mentality has gotten far out of hand. 




 Proving once again, redditors are dicks.

They have a shit conniption over the littlest of things and care little how many lives they destroy in the process.


Downvote me if you like but it is the truth.

 Eeeee ha!

Thank you. :D 




 Thanks so much. I am getting oooooooold! Help me! :O 




 Analogies aside. Sue was unhappy the way people were being treated and resigned. Later The head mod demodded all the mods shut the subreddit down. She wrote the administrators telling them she was doing this. This has been confirmed by the administrators. It was her that did it, not sue. This guilt by association thing is pretty weak tea. 




 Everything!

Well Luann crying was annoying and I could have done without the Manger Babies, but other than that the show was genius! 




 Paper route

(yes I am old) 




 #awesome 




 I don't believe anyone else donated but I could be wrong. But I make mistakes. I will never again endorse anyone here.  




 I found out I was wrong. I am sometimes. I was trying to help the guy. I get scammed too. We ended up banning him and removing the post.  




 Thank you Lunar. :D

Great to hear from you. 




 I did my best to find out what happened once I returned from vacation. What was said came straight from the administrators. But regardless there has been nothing else said by anyone here that is more than hearsay. 

We know for a fact now that the head mod there demodded everyone and wrote that letter to the administrators. And this occurred well after sue left there. How else can we prove that something that was not said, was not said?

And even  regardless of all of that, even it was the case, the head mod performed the action. If any mod closed down a sub because one person talked them into it, they should have never been a mod in the first place. It's like committing a murder and then claiming that someone told me to. That makes zero sense. 




 Thank you so much. We will do all we can to promote the new food bank subreddit once the drama settles down. It is a big hole that really needed to be filled. Let us know how we can help. 

Awesome to hear from you. And thank you for speaking up. :D 




 Thank you sir.  




 Nowhere in that statement does it say that sue talked her into shutting the subreddit down. She simply gave an opinion on why she thought it was shut down. At the time she wrote that, she didn't know what happened either. She just answered that question the best that she could with the knowledge she had. Sure she could have worded it better but not all of us here on reddit are poets. 




 Because it became an attack post. It wasn't promoting anything. All it was doing is causing drama. I wrote to the mod there explaining why and she understood. But I have told her I would do all I can to promote her and help her achieve success there. She is filling a hole here that very much needs to be filled. I am very much in favor of what she is doing and will fill requests there myself.  When the drama dies down, I will ask her to post once again. 




 Yea baby! 




 You are the best. You do me honor. :D 




 I so will.  Thank you so much. :D 




 You are so nice for saying that. It really helps to hear that every now and then. :D 




 Very sweet. Thank you. :D 




 Thanks Davey. Hope all is well with you up there in the Northern Country. :D 




 Thank you so much. Good to hear from you. :D 




 Bless you. I wish each year we got younger. But at least I feel younger hearing sweet comments like that. :D

 HIFW it's my birthday:

 Did I get it right?  




 No the evidence came from the administrators. No one seemed to know the actual events so I asked the administrators. As you can see,  the head mod demodded everyone and wrote a letter to the administrators. This occurred long after sue had left the subreddit. The evidence presented came from the administrators. 

That is the only evidence provided by anyone here. Everything else was just people repeating speculation by an anonymous person no one seems to know the identity of. 

I remember vouching for people long ago. It was a huge mistake. I was right hundreds of times but the few times I was wrong cancelled that out. So we never do that anymore.  




 #Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift; that's why it's called "the present.

*submitted by /u/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch*
 




 You would think so huh? It is unfortunate that all the people she has helped are not speaking up right now. 

Thank you for doing so. :D 




 Actually everyone in this whole thing didn't know jack shit. I went and investigated it and found out what happened. Not from just one side. I asked the administrators what happened. They told me. And I posted their comment here.

Everything, everyone said here was pure speculation and based on hearsay. I am the only one who presented actual sound evidence. 

As for mods asking for anything, they would have less chance to get help here than a known scammer. None of them would dare even try. I don't recall vouching for anyone for a very long time. I  saw the shit storm it could cause so I ceased to do that anymore. We even now have a stated policy in our sidebar that does not allow us to vouch for anyone:

* MODS ARE NOT JUDGES - WE DO NOT JUDGE WHICH REQUESTS ARE WORTHY

That has been in effect for some time now. Mistakes were made in the distant past but we definitely learned from them. It is unfair to equate that with the current situation.

 




 You can want to know all you want. But when it comes to banning people here, I am the one responsible. I am the one that makes the final decisions.  




 Could you do me? I want to look sexy again. 




 If I shut this place down right now, sue could have "knowledge" of why I did it. But it would be speculation. She knows me well and might even be right. But regardless, it would just be an opinion. And all responsibility would be mine. No matter what she said to me beforehand.

And just to let you know, Sue has been the reason I haven't quit here a long time ago. Many times I was on the brink but sue got me to see clearly. Sue is the reason this place has not gone by the way side long ago. 




 #AWESOME! 




 I have more than hearsay. I have the actual quote from the mod telling the administrator shutting the subreddit down. And the administrator stating the head mod demoted everyone before doing so. 

It is very difficult to prove something that did not happen, did not happen. But I have presented evidence of the actual event closing as it took place. 




 I would love to glinda. 

Thank you. 




 You are claiming that sue said she told the head mod over there to shut it down? That sounds highly unlikely. 




 So all of this is predicated on a suspicion. How is one supposed to disprove a suspicion. The actions taken were that of one person. If i shut this place down, I would take responsibility, regardless of what any said to me. 

Excuse me saying this and I mean no disrespect to redditnoobie. But if one person could make me shut down my subreddit, then I have no business running the thing in the first place. If I were to shut this place down, blame me and only me. 




 Thank you dudciles, I appreciate your input. 




 She thought she knew why, you thought you knew why. No one knew what the head mod had done until now. The question about why it happened was asked in our subreddit. She answered the question as best as she could with what knowledge she had.

And I kind of agree that there is zero proof either way, except that we know the head mod demoted everyone and sent that letter. We know that was not sue who did that.

So you say it is okay to call her guilty with no real evidence. But it is not okay to claim innocence on the same basis. 

This whole thing is predicated on an imaginary conversation that an anonymous person claims was made. That is what I call zero evidence.  




 She answered the post as best she could. Don't get all technical with semantics. 




 I didn't say that was the reason all the mods left. I gave the other reason too:

  Others leave because they do not like that I don't allow harassment of users in the posts, I will not impose account age limits again and that i remove comments that are in a harassing nature. Some were very frustrated with me for that. But I stand by my policy that people will not get trolled here. Instead they can report any suspicions to the mods. Some mods did not like that policy at all.

As far as I now that is why the others left. There were no hard feelings, only a difference of opinion.

As for glinda being banned or when it comes to anyone being banned, I take all the responsibility for those actions. And we was after a discussion with the other mods. But I take final responsibility for any actions. I honestly do not see why that is an issue relevant to this conversation. 




 None of these things are the issue here. You claim it was sue that got it shut down. That is not the case. Of course she wasn't happy there. That is why she left. But instead of blaming the person who shut it down, you blame sue.

This is based on a supposed conversation that no one has heard or even knows occurred. Some one please tell me, who was the original person that made the claim this conversation occurred? I mean the only thing used to claim sue had a part in this, is this one imaginary conversation. Who is the person that is claiming that conversation occurred? And why is it being assumed as true. The only basis for blaming sue is an imaginary conversation from an anonymous person.

We too here want to get back to helping people. That is why we are here. I would love to put this behind us. That is why I made this post. 




 So you admit it was redditnoobie that closed the sub? Why are you blaming sue for doing it? You base that all on a conversation no one heard. How can you possibly use that as your soul evidence here? 




 The anger in SRD was fabricated by a few people who have been harassing us for months. We deal with this every few weeks.  And they always do it while I am away on a backpack trip. That way I am not there to present a defense. 

I am quite amazed that you all will not accept real evidence and then turn around use hearsay of one imaginary conversation to deny the truth given. That is amazing. 




 She said why she thought it had been shut down. She did not know, neither did the other mods. It is only now that we know the real reason. 




 If I gave you a screenshot of that conversation, would that satisfy you? 




 You do have access to it. It was a response to a question I asked of the administrators. You made an accusation so I wanted the truth. I asked the people that would know. I asked them.


How do you have evidence of a conversation that never took place? After all you are predicated the guilt on Sue all on the basis of this imaginary conversation no one has heard or even knows exists. And even if it did, Sue did not take the action. It's like blaming sue for a murder someone else committed based on someone claiming there was an imaginary conversation beforehand.  




 Number one, we are not a charity. We do not take in donations and distribute them to others except in very rare cases. Glinda is not banned. But she was briefly because she was spreading untrue things about us and trying to take down our subreddit. That kind of person has no business in our subreddit. But after thinking about we changed our mind.

Why do moderators leave here? Some leave because of witch hunts like this that scare them away. It's not worth the trouble. Others leave because they do not like that I don't allow harassment of users in the posts, I will not impose account age limits again and that i remove comments that are in a harassing nature. Some were very frustrated with me for that. But I stand by my policy that people will not get trolled here. Instead they can report any suspicions to the mods. Some mods did not like that policy at all.

We are currently working on a revamp  of the sidebar. I agree it is atrocious. Our rules are not made clear. The new one will have bots that hit people over the head with the rules. That part is my responsibility and I have been working on it. I have some tech people creating a new format now.

There is not a new rule that prevents mods from asking for help. But any mod here would be crazy to make such a post. None has in quite awhile. We are people  and have crisises too. I have asked my mods long ago to run them by me first and that they never distinguish a request. We do have posts stickied every now and then, that are part of a campaign to help others. Not the mod personally. 




 There is no evidence she did reach out either. How do you present evidence that a conversation did not take place? It is impossible. Whatever the head mod's motivation was, she is the one responsible. She is the one that took the action. 




 So you assume the conversation took place. Her entire involvement in this event is predicated on the assumption a conversation took place?  That has to be most flimsiest evidence ever. You are willing to ignore facts presented by the administration, yet willing to accept without question a conversation that no one heard or even took place for that matter.

Regardless, the actions were taken by the head mod of that subreddit. They alone are responsible, even if that imaginary conversation had taken place. And for the record, it did not. 




 It shows she did not do anything they said she did. The head mod did it all. So if you have anyone to blame, it is the head mod. The head mod there demoted all the other mods and then shut it down. Sue had long since left.

It is absurd to put the blame on someone else because they were a friend of the person responsible. Why has no one even mentioned the person that shut it down? Instead they blame it on a friend of theirs? The logic of that is absurd. 




 A recent post here claimed that /u/sueolsen was responsible for shutting down r/food_pantry. I was away on vacation and did not get a chance to properly address it.

The truth:  Uttered bull crap

I did some inquiring to find proof since I was not associated with it but here is what the administration said:

-------------

 [A] to /r/Assistance/ sent 5 hours ago

 Wanted to reach out and see if things have calmed down a bit. Since there seems to be some confusion, the head moderator at food_pantry demodded the others and shut the subreddit down. He or she sent the following modmail, which nobody saw since they were all demodded a few minutes later:

 Hi guys. It is with a hollow heart that I wish to announce that I will be closing /r/food_pantry down for good. The last 4 years has been one hell of an adventure. There have been so many people helped through this subreddit, but I can't in good conscience, sit around and wait for it to be corrupted by the admins. I watched /u/kickme444 [+1] grow an amazing community only for reddit to hijack it and turn it into the monstrosity it is now. What was once a wonderful community about giving to others within the community has turned into a circle jerk about bringing in money through the Reddit marketplace or promoting reddit through the world records. And it's not just redditgifts, reddit is not the site it was 4 years ago when I created this sub. All the censoring and shadiness... I would rather remember the sub that I created while it's still what I created, than what it could be if the admins decide to wedge their grubby hands on it and find some way of squeezing money out of her, while squeezing us out.
I appreciate you all so much. I will forever look back on this time fondly 3 I hope you all understand my decision.

 The TL;DR is that there isn't any indication that you or anyone else had anything undue going on. The other mods there are probably just confused since all they know is they got demodded and the sub got closed.

------

The truth is Sue was tired of the people getting bashed there so she quit  as a mod. That was the end of her association there. The subreddit closed months later, long after her association with it. She had nothing to do with it. 

I am here to field your questions as long as they are done in a civil manner. We are tired of the drama but felt you deserved to know the truth and for Sue be exonerated. 




 It's not until tomorrow but thank you Sue. :D

Love ya! 




 It's like taking a poll at Fox News. It's total bullshit. 




 That would be okay  I think. But it is has gone so much more reddit-wide. I kind of want to reach a huge audience, so more than just the people with the pitchforks and torches have a chance to reply. I very much appreciate your input though. 




 That has 27 users. I don't think that is going to reach anyone.


Hopefully it will grow. Looks like something for the future though. 




 I am asking for a forum for this. This is not it. Could you please allow people to actually answer the question asked here. You will have your chance to continue your witch hunt then. 




 Oh. I am going between many questions on many posts. 

I have an issue that is current. It has nothing to do with past mistakes. Sure i have made some but that is not what I am asking to address. You guys have crucified one of my mods. I have proof that shows you were wrong. I want the ability to present that evidence in a fair forum. Not with crazy people like jenz screaming out of control. I want to talk with sane people who are willing to listen. That is what this post is asking for.

 




 Woo Hoo! Great news for democrats. 




 So you are not willing to look at the evidence? 




 I unbanned you. Now will you look at the evidence?  




 I am asking for a forum here to have this discussion. You will have your chance to ask your questions and continue your witch hunt once I do. So I will kindly ask you cease having the debate here. 




 When you spread lies and try to destroy us, that is what happens. 

We now have proof from the administrators sue had nothing to do with shutting down food pantry. Will you view that evidence and admit sue had nothing to do with it? I will unban you if you at least read it. 

In fact I will unban you anyway. I didn't do it in the first place. Now will you read the proof and actually admit you may have been wrong if the proof shows that. The proof comes from the administrators:

 




 And this is an example of one of the witch hunters. I am trying to find a forum to answer it under fair conditions. Not from the above witch hunter.

 




 That is not a question relevant to this discussion. You claim Sue shut down food pantry and scammed money. That is what this post is about. If you want to ask moderators why they left, go for it. But do it elsewhere.

But the short is answer is because people like you badger them and intimidate them until they feel it is not worth it.

Now answer my question:

I have provided proof that sue did not shut down food pantry. Do you deny that? It came straight from the administrators mouth. 

#So do you admit you were wrong about sue shutting down food pantry? 









 You constantly bring up irrelevant things in an endless effort not to admit you were wrong.

#You were wrong

Why won't you admit it. You started another one of your witch hunts. I have provided proof you were wrong and won't admit it.


#YOU WERE WRONG!

Stop asking irrelevant questions and admitL:

#YOU WERE WRONG

 




 I don't know ask sue. Why do you refuse to see she had nothing to do with it even after proof has been presented. When will you ever admit you were wrong?

I have proof. I presented it. And all you do is ask silly questions. You were wrong. I proved it.  




 Well obviously you two are not here to find out the truth. Just here to spread lies. 

When I answer your questions you refuse to see anything. Instead you make fun of our bots. 

If you have any other serious questions, let me know, although I know your quest is not for the truth because as we have seen here, you that when proof is presented you are wrong, you will not admit it.

Proof has been presented sue had nothing to do with foodpantry shutdown. But you go ahead and make fun of our bots if that makes you happy. 




 I have no idea of it being preferential or not. I asked a question and got an answer. 


But why is that now that you see the truth, that this is the only question you seem to want answered? Can't you see that the accusations against Sue were false. Why are you now not addressing that instead of making accusation of preferential treatment. Seems quite odd to me. It seems to me that you are not interested in the truth. Only to continue the falsehoods that had previously been presented. 




 I returned from a 4th of July vacation late Monday night. I had no idea what was going on. So i wrote and asked for the information. I just received an answer a short time ago.  That is all there is to it. 




 Yes_it_is_weird is a mod here who does no modding. He creates our bots. He needs access to our page to do the work he does. This guy did the same thing. At the time we did know he was a scum bag. We removed him and Sue's daughter no longer has  contact with. Coincidentally, their divorce is officially final today. 




 Yes. We needed some technical help. I am shitty with that. Sue said he could help us with it. He did it but he never did any modding. He was removed later. 




 He was added to some technical work on the sidebar and our Christmas video. He never did any modding.  




 Let us continue it now:

Here is how foodpantry closed. This is right out of the mouths of the administrators:

-----------------------


These are the words of the administrators. There accounting of how it was closed. Sue had long since quit because she didn't like how people were being bashed. She has nothing to do with it. 




 There was no shady behavior. Sue daughter's slimy husband left her and her kids in a horrible situation. They had no money for food or heat in a cold ass winter. There was nothing shady about the request at all.

No one slinked in the shadows. Is is all out in the open to see. 




 I never claimed I funded all of it. But mods have asked me to post for a long time now. They are scared to death of the mob out there. I don't blame them 




 No it is not. I am train_subject8344. One reddit account now for six years.

Frogzilla is an awesome person.  




 What horse shit.  




 I was the one who gave her kid the money. And yes she needed it. This whole thing is a witch hunt.  So before jumping on the internet witch burning wagon, it might be wise to get the facts from the person who actually gave the money.

 Thank you. Your post is all set. Good luck. :D 




 Good luck 




 Good job. You can just make another post over there I believe. I am not sure of the rules there but there are very nice people over there. 




 You may also want to post this to r/guitar. I hope we can find you some help. :D 




 I have restored the post. Thank you for registering.

Could you please remove your email address though. Only supply that by a PM. It's for your own safety we ask this.  Good luck to you. :D

 So this is how its going to be huh?  




 Done. :D 




 Shoot. I am on the west coast and had the same problem. I went on some of the local subreddit and didn't have much luck finding people.  But then I saw a post about some guys north of me (400 miles) going on a trip. I responded and have been backpacking with them for like four years now. 

If you ever get out to the western part of the US, hit me up, we always have a trip coming up and welcome new folks to go with us. We have an absolute blast. 




 Where do live or where do you want to go backpacking? 




 Thank you for helping. :D 




 Cool. I changed your registration to reflect your new account. Good luck. :D 




 You have been banned for  posting lies and trolling. 




 I changed your registration to reflect that. My suggestion is to let us remove this post and you post again under the other name. You have a **newregistereduser** flair by your name on this post. If you post again with your other account, it will have the regular **registered** flair by it, thereby giving you a better chance.

It is up to you though.

# **This post has been removed so OP can post with his older account** 




 Sure thing. Let us know if we can ever be any help to you. :D 




 No problem. Here to help. Good luck to you. :D 




 Take your drama elsewhere. We have had enough for one day. 




 We wish you luck. We will put you in our side bar of list of helpful subreddits. 




 You would have better luck if you used your real account. Few people give to new accounts. At the very least, you should put in your post that you will share your real username by PM if you are considering giving.
