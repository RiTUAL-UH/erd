 Years later, Pavel was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the bear enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Pavel and his son Pavel Jr. were standing. The large bear stared at Pavel, lifted its paws off the ground, and played with a plastic chair. The bear did that several times then roared loudly, all the while staring at the man. 

Remembering the his dear friend from 2011, Pavel couldn't help wondering if this was the same bear. Pavel summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the bear and stared back in wonder. The bear roared again, wrapped its arms around Pavel's chest and crushed his ribcage, killing him instantly. Probably wasn't the same bear. 









 But there [is hope](http://www.amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/offset_smokers.html). 









 I'm using a standard Char-broil offset smoker, and I'm monitoring the temperature, keeping it between 230 and 250 for 7, or even 8 hours.  I've also got a water pan in there to keep things moist.  But the ribs and boston butt are never done, and the fat isn't completely rendered, so I have to finish them in a 350 degree oven for half an hour to an hour.  How can they not be done after 8 hours? 

The only other clue I have is that I'm monitoring the temperature with a redi-check remote thermometer, which is an internal-temperature thermometer; is it possible that this is giving me an incorrect reading?

This is driving me insane.  I'd appreciate any advice, Pitmasters.

EDIT: OK, thanks for the advice.  It sounds like I need a new thermometer, and to learn about this newfangled "3-2-1 Method".  Depending on how that works, I'll look into heat loss.

BTW, I'm not using the thermometer for internal meat temperature, I'm using it for the ambient internal temperature of the smoker.

It's from a collection of Renaissance etchings that I bought a couple of years ago.

 How are you planning on printing them.  For etchings/engravings/drawings, I'd like to find a service bureau with a high quality laser printer who could print on nice paper.  Any recommendations?

 That looks like a good choice.  I have a similar Char-broil model that I got from Home Depot a few years ago for about the same price.  Go for it! 




 Excellent.  Thanks for the link to the paints. 




 Hey all.  I've had a standard Char-broil offset smoker for a few years, and the firebox is getting pretty rusty on the top and sides, I assume from the heat.  Has anybody else confronted this situation? 




 Yeah, I just added the "Add My Local Library Branch" link.  If you click on it, it then tries to determine your location. 




 Fixed.  Thanks for the QA! 




 Sweet!  I'll get on that :) 




 OK, done! 




 Good idea.  Thanks! 









 If you share your location it will return results from your local library. 



















 [A little better] (http://funnyr.com/cgi-bin/funnyr.cgi?content_id=62):

Two Arabs are sitting in the window and middle seats on a plane. The Arabs ask the Jew sitting in the aisle seat to get them a glass of orange juice so they won't have to crawl over him. While he is up getting the drinks, they spit in his shoes. When they are about to land the Jewish guy puts on his shoes and realizes what has happened. He complains to the Arabs, "When will it all end? The hatred... the violence... the killing... the spitting in shoes... the peeing in orange juice..."
