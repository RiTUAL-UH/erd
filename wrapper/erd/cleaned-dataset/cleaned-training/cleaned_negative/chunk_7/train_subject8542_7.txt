 Red XIII, aka Nanaki. 

I feel he's such an overlooked character in ff7 sometimes. His general temperament and his development in Cosmo canyon is amazing. 

Also, he's got a radical design and I have him tattooed on me. 




 That is a Nanaki tattoo! Still not finished, but still worth the 210 I've paid for it already! 




 Face thread? Stick my two "tat pics" together and you have my face! :D

 Pretty new myself. If he has his ask box open, you might be able to get him there. You might be able to follow him, then send a fan mail, but again, I think there's a time limit, though not 100% sure on that either.

 I think I'll reformat the book type from a two person perspective to a one character perspective. I guess it's a little ambitious for a first time writer.

Thanks for the advice, it's helped. :)  




 Awesome. I'm on my phone and can't see shit. [](/hahaha)

 Yeah, I guess I'm writing from the wrong perspective. I need to focus on the character's point of view, rather than a bystander's (so to speak). So it's kind of like a form of Role Playing, or acting. Just temporarily jump into their shoes and write what they'd actually think. 

Right, I think I get you properly this time. Cheers. :D 




 Awesome! Thanks. Just gotta add depth to my descriptions and dialogue then, I guess. Gotcha. 




 Yeah, I probably picked the part I had most fun writing. I should probably post in a little characterization instead. I had a few pages of Shia'le and Taern having a bit of development. which I might post up, my draft at the moment is about 6.5k words long. 

I'll work on describing surroundings more though. 

I can post up the less action oriented, and more character focused section if you'd like?

Thanks for the feedback!  




 Yeah - with the whole non-human thing, it's explained right at the start of the story. I just dragged an except out toward the end of the section.

But I'm marking down a few areas now where I need to go over "talking too much about tech" 

Cheers for the feedback! 




 Hi /r/writing!

I'm currently working on a little project for an "origin story" for a race in the universe I'm building.

While I am only a hobbyist (I work full time, and study when not working or writing), I'd love some brutally honest feedback, to know where I can/should improve. I have recieved good feedback on the entire story so far, but I feel like my friends were being nice in order to not hurt my feelings. I never went to University, and only did one year of college (I'm from the UK)

**Be brutally honest as you can!** I promise I can take it! :P Not looking for anything on plot, as what I've included doesn't really include much plot. I'm looking for more feedback on the writing style and a general impression of the piece.

I'm not really _aiming_ for publication. It's more of a little personal project I have going on. But I may look at publishing onto a digital format, depending on costs.

[Link to a Google Docs page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QRjlbTjQAzJvJcp8lVqV7n0NlCJk1BUGQe55SKwWxaU/edit) 




 It'd be pretty neat, hanging out with an alien race and all that, but considering the shortest person alive on Luetem is 6'5" and the average is around 7"8, I'd probably feel a _little_ intimidated.

Shia'le is like, 8 feet tall, it's freaky. 




 I know, right? Tea is clearly the superior drink! [](/rarityannoyed) 




 Was gonna say, the style looks similar to the old Mac Hall comic.

 It was a pretty grim night, by all standards. Rain and hail was bouncing off the window making a rather dull drumming reverberate through the bar.

I mean, the weather in winter on Ratine was pretty bad, but this was just taking the cake. Feln, Canir and Humans were all darting between shelter, making their way to the huge bar planted dead center of the market.

Rein brought the alcoholic beverage to his mouth and took a rather large swig. He'd been hiding here for a few weeks. It was nice and busy, he'd go mostly unnoticed here. That was, of course, until Warren Shaile turned up. That nosy bastard was out looking for him. He'd heard the stories, but he could totally avoid him. He had to. There was no way he was going back to Limitless. 

He'd endured centuries of pain, testing, surgery. All illegally. by all accounts, he didn't exist. He was nothing. Fuck that, he'd shake off Shaile and expose those bastards. He doesn't know how yet, but there had to be a way to get the word out without exposing himself in the public eye.

Public terminal? Maybe, but so far, he's stuck on Ratine. Last thing he needed was Warren and his cronies surrounding him. In the only place he can hide for the next few months. 

It was an amazing fear he even got to Ratine, really. Getting out of that station was a miracle in itself, never mind getting across the galaxy.

It still baffled Rein, He was brought up in the 21st century, where it took hours to cross the planet, and here he was, about 80,000 light years away from that station mere days later. He liked Ratine, originally. But he arrived in summer. A lovely, vibrant jungle, covered in merchant stalls on the surface, while the rich and powerful lived miles high on their floating city, protected by all sorts of fancy gadgetry that would probably make Rein even more confused that he already was.

The poor were "trapped" on the surface.  A couple of years ago, a company tried to terraform the planet, to make it just a little _less_ hostile for mining operation, but it cocked up something fierce. Operations went ahead, but the winters are so harsh, it rivaled even the old arctic back on earth. Work was always halted on the surface in winter, but people continued to live down here anyway. Have-a-go engineers were trying to make the outdoor conditions somewhat hospitable during the harsh winter, but fires occasionally broke out with loose wires accidentally crossed. 

Snow dunes crept across the landscape in the distance, moving ever closer to the small market town. Soon, men in ships would arrive and move the dune over the town, making sure the town isn't buried. It was a sight to see, according to the locals. Rein couldn't wait! 

enough of that, he needed to find a way of getting Limitless to fall, guinea pigs of Limitless and their competitors littered the stations of Purseus, abandoned by the corporation after their testing is complete. It was a sickening sight.

A sight Warren knew all too well. His first case was to track down one of these victims, who had gone missing after heading to Purseus for a "routine implant check". Warren found him begging for change. He wasn't as described but it was him alright. He looked like a Picasso painting, a proper mess. It took days for Warren to talk him around and to go home to his wife. Who, despite his new grotesque appearance appeared over the moon to see her husband again. It was a sick business, but the Universal Council weren't even looking into it. 

It was a problem everyone knew existed but no-one did anything about.  Warren was committed to ending this godawful practice, even if it meant working for one of them.

(Oh damn, that's a lot. But that's 30 minutes of brain leakage right there)

[This is my Age 20 crash]

(http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6wbgoG4mm1qcfe4ro1_500.jpg) There was way more damage, but I only had time to capture the front as the recovery truck came to take it away.

My Age 21 Crash: http://taernfastgrade.tumblr.com/post/10244162781/fucking-hell-that-hurt-burns-and-cuts-on-my-arm 




 I love telling stories! :D I'll tell all three because I've nothing better to do.

Age 10: 
--
It's my sister's 6th Birthday, and my 10th Birthday was mere weeks after, so we (My mum) decided to combine our birthday parties into one. We went to the nearby pool (Indoor, because outdoor pools in England in January?  HAH!)
Anyway, I'm pretty much a fish in water, up until a few years ago, I was in a swim team, but I'm diversing.

Lets just say, I dived underwater, because going underwater is awesome, and when I tried to surface, there was a rather... Large kid on one of those spongy floaty things. After bashing the bottom a little bit, the kid finally realised there was something up and jumped off. I nearly passed out and drowned.

Age 20:
--
This one was kind of my fault. I had an hour to zip to an exporters, exchange some stuff and get back to work on time.. I had 10 minutes left on the last 3 miles - I got this! 
At this pojng, I'm still on the motorway, coming around a rather large sweeping bend at around 60 mph.

My tyre blew out.. I wobbled all over the road, trying to control the car, before another tyre gave way, and I careered off into a motorway lane barriers at 50mph, hit it, span around and completely took out my back end on the barrier again.

At this point, I'm in the fast lane, facing the wrong way. Anyone could come around that corner and completely fuck me and my car over. Luckily, it was pretty quiet and I somehow managed to restart the car and limp it over to the hard shoulder for recovery. No injuries whatsoever, I was a lucky bastard. Just had to pay for the barrier repair, and my insurers covered the car repair.

This one prompted me to have a bit of a meltdown and I shaved off all my hair and closed myself off for weeks, being completely sure I should have been dead.

Age 21 (last year!):
--
Another Automobile accident, this time, completely not my fault.

I used to work as a van driver. I used to drive this wee [Purgeot Partner](http://www.nortonwaypeugeot.com/images/new-vans/large/peugeot-partner-van.png) about for stationary deliveries and such.

I was coming around another long sweeping road, with a 30mph limit. I'm tracked in that van, so I was sticking to the speed limit pretty strictly..
As I approached a junction, As I had right of way, I kept going. A guy just exited it without looking. My van came off better, but it was still a mess. The clash of metal, the screeching of my brakes, and the eventual thud of hitting a barrier brought back some pretty harsh memories of the year before. Everything went white - but that's because the Airbag went off, and the white bonnet had popped up. But my chest was on FIRE. I opened the door of the van and staggered out, clutching my chest, the airbag felt getting a solid punch in the chest.

I staggered over to the other driver, despite bystanders shouting "Sit down, your chest! Someone call an ambulance!" to make sure he was fine. He was fine, his car had just span on the spot a little. But I noticed his engine was smoking.. and so was mine. "Dude, your engine. I'm going turning mine off too." 

I rang my boss to tell him what had happened, then the police, fire engine and ambulance came.. It wasn't until a bystander said to me "You are lucky, any faster, you would have gone right through that barrier and into the river."

I just sat there, completely out of it until the Paramedic came to check on me. I got Whiplash pretty bad and couldn't walk properly for weeks. Got a decent payout too..

Other driver didn't have insurance (which is illegal here in the UK), so he got a ban, I think.

 




 Scares? Hm.. Had quite a few in the past. Nothing recent though, thankfully!

I have nearly died three times though, scary stuff. 




 As the Flair suggests, I'm in Bolton, just north of the city. Born, raised and work here. I think at this point, I'm never leaving.

I'm an IT Trainer. :D 




 Thanks for the help. :) I'll let you know what they say when they get back to me. 




 I have an e-mail set and ready to go - could you possibly give it a look over for me before I hit the send button?

Hi there,

Over the past few months, I've been borrowing from Wonga - and while happy with the service, I fear I may have dug myself in a little too deep.

I am contacting you to attempt to set up a repayment plan, I can pay around 200 pcm, which means the outstanding debt can be paid off within 4 months.

If you could contact me back ASAP, that'd be fantastic.

Thank you,

Nathan.
 




 You could do that?

I owe it to Wonga. I didn't think they'd even give me the time of day for something like that. 




 Jammy bastard. Never won anything on a scratchcard, and you go and win on all your lines! :( 




 Cheers man, anything helps at the moment.

I'm gonna give my bank another try, see if I can pursuade them to let me borrow.. Anything's better than paying back to borrow right away again. 




 Long story short, I fucked up and now I owe a Payday Loan company 800..

It's been months and they refuse to help me pay them off slowly over time, and I'm in that vicious cycle where I pay it off, then have to borrow more to pay off the last round.

If anyone could lend me the cash, I would be so damn grateful.
I can pay back 200 per month, plus interest. I fell off the boat months ago, now trying to make myself stable again.

I would be so grateful if anyone could help, I'm desperate. My credit rating as been dropped so bad over the last few months and bank loans are turning me down.

British based, obviously, Manchester. But I can pay anyone who is willing to help, including fees if it came to transferring.

 But yeah, I'm with ITB. I've had a relatively good experience with them, though I'm a daywalker for the most part, They used to get me for the 9am commute and shave off 20 miles or something, but 6k miles a year is alright for me.

I've not needed to top up, but if you are driving heavily, ITB generally isn't a good one to go for. Good for city dwellers such as myself. 




 Yes! Finally!

But I've yet to watch today's episode. Gonna catch it in a few hours. 




 It is tempting, but the cops with those NPR cameras will catch you if you drive in front of a copper for more than a few minutes.

And I've seen first hand what happens to guys with no insurance. Was coming round a corner and the guy pulled out without looking. Driving without insurance. His was a writeoff, so it just got crushed and 6 points on his license, and find a few grand.

The premiums are so damn stupid nowadays though... What's helped me is going for a tracker in my car for insurance purposes.


First started out with with my current insurers at 2k p/a.

I'm in that age range where it's "He's a boy racer, charge him shit tons"

In a year, I've knocked my yearly price down from 2k to 1k, and that was with an-almost-writeoff a while back because of a blowout on the motorway.

I know being tracked is all Privacy concerns, yadayadayada, but I see it as a price reducer, and an extra security device. If on the chance my car gets robbed, insurers can track it. 




 Let them keep him, I say. I think he'd be too scared to come back anyway, after Leveson and all that. 




 Hm, as my fellow briton mentioned, it's rather hard for me to "Big meself up" without feeling a bit bigheaded, BUT TO HELL WITH IT

Primarily, I'm an IT Trainer, but I like to think my overactive imagination will pay off one day. I reckon I'll end up finishing this Game Design course (Home Learning is a double edged sword, folks!) and I'll write and design a game that's totally bitchin' and will get top marks everywhere.

That's wishful thinking, like.. But I like to think I write some damn good fiction. I've 2 novel projects I'm going on-off with because work and studies are clashing.

Also, I reckon I'm easily forgiving and try to be as generous as possible - once or twice I have run myself to the ground because god damnit, it's a friend's birthday, and I'm not getting them _nothing!_

Although I am a lazy fucker at best and it takes a lot to get me out of bed. 
I guess that's the con to being me.

 Might be worth zipping into a hairdresser's aand asking "Hey, I'm trying to get long hair, could you maybe tidy it up a little?"

 I'm CisMale, and I've got long hair. I keep it down all the time, unless I'm working - where I tie it up into a ponytail. No-one really gives me a second glance.

I mean, I might be going in the wrong direction here, but as you transition longer hair might be a blessing to help you feel more feminine.  




 To Redeem the FF Series (for me, anyway) would be going back to the old game-types, like FF9 or FF7.

My favourite final fantasy has to be FF9. The story is quite engaging - and with the previous two protagonists being someone Strong, Silent and "emotionally sensitive", Zidane was a breath of fresh air, as was FF10's Tidus.

With the Old PS1/SNES/NES Final Fantasies, the presence of a World Map gave the player a bigger feeling of an open world - you could just jump on the airship, chocobo or boat and pilot it around yourself - none of this "Fast Travel"

I might just be a nostalgic git, but I've recently replayed FF7 and I'm playing FF9 again, and they just seem like better *games* than the recent offerings. I couldn't find myself getting into FF13 at all. I tried, I tried so damn hard, but the linear corridor runs made me feel a little (metaphorically) claustrophobic. With the old titles, you could have different entry points on each "map" to find hidden items each map had 1 (or 2) "Camera" points, which made it a little easier to orient yourself in the surrounding areas.

As far as I went in FF13 - to find chests, all I had to do was run off the "corridor" a little. Also, the combat system bugged me a little - but if there's one thing Square did, it was change the combat system with each iteration of FF. FF7 had Materia, FF8 had Drawing and Junctioning (Which I dislike and couldn't really play it properly), FF9 had AP - etc.

FF13 has a sphere-grid -esque system, but it's locked to one "class". Switching "jobs" mid battle got confusing at best, especially when it affected all characters rather than just the one. the old FF's pulled the job system quite well - and so did FF10-2 (Which I enjoyed, despite the shit that got too)

In short, I feel with FF13, the game has gotten _too_ linear. A little open-ness wouldn't hurt! 




 Despite the shit it got, I found BRINK quite fun in short bursts. The single player and Multiplayer are practically identical, single player is bots on your team/enemy team, and multiplayer is actual people.

 When I go jogging, I definitely bring him with me, though he is pull-y if I have him on the lead, so I let him loose - He's good and always stays in line of sight.

 Not only will it have a military use - think of all those sci-fi gadgets you read about.  Computers built into your clothes, all your tracking apps on your phone you use to monitor where you run, how fast, etc.. Instead of relying on your phone keeping a GPS, your clothes could have that functionality built in. 

On a somewhat related topic, all those AR games like Ingress could use sensors in your clothes, powered by this tech let you know when there's a place of interest nearby, maybe like a little vibrating motor on the back of your neck or on your shoulder
