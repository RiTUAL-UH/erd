 Oh man, that's adorable. You need to take some shots of her in a desert somewhere to make it look like she is on mars. 




 and then a cat jumps on the lid and shuts the kiddywink in. At least it'd make a funny gif

 You should post to r/photoshopbattles 




 If you're white and middle/upper middle class (see attached photo) you'll fit in. 




 It's insecure bigoted tourists that ruin holidays. People should save themselves the money and mental anguish by watching travel program from the comfort of their couch instead. 




 It's a melting pot where the ingredients don't get along with each other 




 I almost couldn't bear that comment 




 Much cheese!

 Christine McCorkindale eh. Too bad she hasn't done anything else. I only recently found out the mighty **Doug Bradley** was in it too! 




 Good work on your pickup too. Spent about an hour last night looking for an affordable trench coat 




 Good eye! I didn't even check before making my own submission. What are the odds... 




 Nah I bought it. Cbf crafting.

 LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! 




 Congratulations dude! Get that kid a pigskin, STAT! 




 He's a biggun! 




 Religious ceremony in a living room eh... 




 Tanaka doesn't age. Endo looks 17 




 How glovely. 




 Could you imagine looking at people and seeing them as 2d representations in a 3d space? Think paper mario/dukenukem 3d. Holy shitballs weird. 




 I enjoyed bc1 more than bc2. But nostalgia does that. Vehicles like the golf buggy were obviously map specific and you had the tanks and light vehicles. The maps had a more "designed for multiplayer" feel about them and not as natural/realistically structured as in bc2. 




 Until they ruin bc3, I still have hope. 




 There was levity. Troops would joke with each other and you could cut sick in a golf buggy [bc1] or a quad [bc2]. It wasn't "This a super cereal mission. Look at this palette of blue, black and grey-foreboding isn't it?"

BC tried to be just a game and not a war simulator 




 I read that in H. Jon Benjamin's voice 




 Battlefront was pretty cool too. The thing I enjoyed about the BC series is that it didn't take itself too seriously. 




 BC3 where art thou? 




 Kentucky Fried Movie was awesome 




 Fuckin' awesome
 




 and not a decent sized torrent of rockford files anywhere. 600mb per episode? getdafuggout
