 For me its circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, R1, L2, L1, triangle, circle, triangle. Spawned tanks until I crashed my PS2.

 About a mile/20 minute walk from the hotel, but midtown is packed with bars. You have Waterworks, Spaceport, Wine Loft, Mockingbird, Leon Pub, Midtown Filling Station, and Finnegan's Wake, all within a tiny radius of each other. 
There is also a neat speakeasy in the area. You'll probably want to call ahead with a reservation and the drinks are pretty pricy, but its a cool experience. http://www.alchemymidtown.com/ Also Level 8 in Hotel Duval, and Midtown Station a little up Monroe are also there. But if you have the time, definitely take check out Fermentation Lounge. It's a really nice place to have a drink with some friends and make new ones. I now realize I look like a drunk. 




 The sound of buzzing when they released the confetti made me think they just unleashed a horde of bees into the stadium.  




 I just passed this 2 days ago and was sad that I missed the picture. :( 




 Yeaaaaaah 




 I prefer the Sprite/blue Powerade mix to be more accessible, especially in a restaurant since they're both coke products and can be easily combined in any restaurant with a Coca Cola fountain. 




 Friend: "Happy Birthday, man!"

Me: "Thanks! You too! Fuck..." 




 Stop by. You can tour the facilities and ask them some questions. Checked it out last year during the reddit meet up and will probably join when I move to Jax in a couple months.

 Thanks. Wasn't aware of their existence.  




 Couldn't find a good way to get to someone who would know anything through the phone number.  




 Any places in town where one can acquire a wine crate outside of getting lucky at a thrift store? Preferably for little to no money. 




 Just go to Walmart and ask for banana boxes. They have handles and are pretty great for moving. 




 This is the video that makes me unsubscribe from this subreddit for good. 




 Reminds me of the music video for [Big Bad Wolf by Duck Sauce](http://youtu.be/VGRQGm4-A4k) (NSFW) 




 The amount of detail in the Aquaman's costume was absolutely stunning. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/dabJ1Yk.jpg)'s a high rez picture I took of him at Megacon. I believe he said it took him about a years work. 




 I didn't realize there was more than the one bathroom. 




 I honestly thought this was a post in /r/shorthairedhotties for more than a few seconds. 




 Its...its been so long. Congratulations. 




 I've had far too many reasons to post this video. [(NSFW)](http://youtu.be/oolu-k3tY-g?t=38s)  




 [Video](http://youtu.be/Tq3PMhgqXsk?t=16s) of them in action. 




 Horse Steppin' - Sun Araw from the Hotline Miami soundtrack is pretty great.  




 Quick vector of Dexter. I'll get around to Dee Dee in a bit. http://i.imgur.com/M1GFcRD.png 




 Also if you have any Asian grocery stores in your area, they're pretty likely to have it.
