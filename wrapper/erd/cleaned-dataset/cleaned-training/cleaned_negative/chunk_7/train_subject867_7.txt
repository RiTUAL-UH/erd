 Yeah, I didn't use cassettes as often as VHS. But I definitely had a few cassette tapes. One had a song called "15 Ways to Stay Out of Trouble." It was a fun song. 




 I got a job as a painfully shy 14-year-old at a pizza restaurant. Don't know why they hired me, I mean, I was 14 and quiet and I was even late to the interview.

My favorite place to work was at the front at the cash register, but after about a month of working I was almost always assigned to the backroom where I would spent 5-7 hours washing dishes. Just fucking terrible. But I was too shy and insecure to ask my manager if I could work the front more. Worked there for about six months before I couldn't take another shift washing their gross food off dishes alone in the backroom and I quit. 

I got another job at 16, and then again this year where I learned a lot about being confident in your work, being upfront with your managers, and how to make friends with coworkers. It was truly amazing to see how much I had grown since I got that god awful job when I was 14. 




 Still waiting for it as an 18 year old.... 




 My dog, if he counts as an item.
