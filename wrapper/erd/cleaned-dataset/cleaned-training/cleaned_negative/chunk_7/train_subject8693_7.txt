 Doesn't matter who it is, I won't be seeing shit. Crystal Skull was a fucking nightmare.

 Can..can I put my dick in it? 









 Bitch got what she deserves.

Really with the downvotes? We've got some rude fucking people on here I guess. Dude was trying to do schoolwork and the cunt stepped on his papers dancing like a fucking retard. But no, he's in the wrong somehow.

 I highly recommend watching the movie. The conversation alone helped me see everything in my life in a new perspective. 














 It is indeed. Silicon Penis Man at your service. 




 So you're telling me the real villain is the company making these glasses? 




 Spread it on toast. 




 That reminds me, how is your mom OP? 









 Definitely try it out, just make sure to remove any seeds first and give it a good wash. 




 Try de-seeded red pepper. No more than 1/4 of a slice. Cavies can eat peppers every so often and that small slice has 10x the vitamin C of an entire orange. When I found out about it I wondered why they keep making orange juice when peppers get the job done so much better lol. 




 I'm in love.

 Not exactly. The photo was found on a roll of film after Corll was killed, belonging to one of his accomplices. He couldn't remember taking the photo or who the guy was, but was able to come up with a timeline based on when the camera was purchased.

In the photo the guy isn't strapped to Corll's torture wall, so odds are his nightmare was just beginning in this pic. The torture wall was what he cuffed them to when the actual rape/torture occurred.

 Who gave Charlie heroin? 














 Nothing, it just let out a little wine. 



















 Thank you :) I love GoT, but I haven't been able to watch anything past the 3rd season. 




 The blood you see is his. The film opens with him eviscerating himself, followed by Mother Nature masturbating his corpse and impregnating herself with his semen. 














 #I want to address the points people are bringing up:

*The evolution aspect is completely possible. Earth goes through a period of radiation, introduction of alien bacteria, etc. Not to mention you're applying evolution as observed on earth to beings from a distant planet.

*Harold Zoid. We know Decapods shed their shells when they become cramped, but Harold has been a shut-in for years. He's to poor to afford a new one, which would explain why he looks so decrepit. Not to mention it would explain his bad attitude because his soft body is painfully squished in his carapace. 




 Consider though that Decapods shed their shells when they get cramped, but Harold is poor as hell, so I doubt he can afford one. It might also explain why he's so unpleasant because he's cramped in an old, deteriorating shell.

 Keep in mind what the world goes through during that time though. All the radiation, introduction of alien bacteria, etc. It's possible that those factors altered his species evolution, and that's only if we apply the understanding of evolution on earth. It could be different on Decapod 10. 




 The exact quote is, "That stench - that heavenly stench." 




 That would be awesome. Maybe we need to chant for them like Candyman or Bloody Mary. 




 Holy shit this hits close to home for me.
