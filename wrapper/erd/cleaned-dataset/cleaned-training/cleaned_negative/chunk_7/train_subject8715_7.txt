 Dibbs on the Broncos... 




 Oh yeah, I loved 2K5. It was an amazing game. Obviously Madden 15 has its problems, but it is definitely the best Madden game in years. I guess take that for what it's worth.
 




 Madden 15 is a big step up, at least for me, on the PS4. Madden 25's defensive AI was terrible and I hated every second of it. 




 I'm in and I'd like to put in my vote for fantasy draft. Makes it far more interesting. 




 He said that, but a chance to return to your old team with one of the most talented rosters in the NFL is a different ball game. 




 The fact that it happened so quickly leads me to believe it has to be Kubiak as the #1 choice. I would guess they didn't want him to make a decision before they had a chance to offer. 




 My favorite was supposedly Walt's favorite. The transformation shot from Cinderella. Especially with the music
