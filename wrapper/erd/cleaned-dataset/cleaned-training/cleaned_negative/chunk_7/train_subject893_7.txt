 Youre actually not allowed to have your phone out at all in a courtroom  









 There isn't always a buyer for every seller, it's why penny stocks are essentially useless, because you may not be able to liquidate them. If someone buys an obscene amount of BTC at once and never sells it then it will limit the supply and make it worth more. If people suddenly start dumping BTC then buyers will have the barter advantage and set a lower market price.  




 It's because it's not used as a currency. Most gold is used to create jewelry which is not normally reintroduced into the market, essentially removing it from the world supply. If people were regularly walking into stores using their jewelry to pay for things then you would see the value of gold begin to drop. 




 It's a joke that  guys with overly flashy vehicles are compensating for a small dick. 




 The supply of stocks in a company is fixed but the value fluctuates, the supply of gold is (theoretically) fixed but the value fluctuates. Think of it this way, (for the sake of simplicity were going to assume that people only sell 1 BTC at a time) you've got X number of people trying to buy BTC and Y number of people trying to sell BTC. As long as X=Y the value of BTC remains the same. If XY the value of BTC increases, if XY the value of BTC decreases. 




 The problem with almost all of those is that it's incredibly risky to keep any significant sum in Bitcoin for more than a couple days at a time. It doesn't matter if you're able to keep your assets unfrozen if you're potentially going to lose half of it overnight due to some dnm bullshit that's completely unforeseeable. 




 A 10 year old.... 




 You're glossing over the fact that we dropped leaflets in Hiroshima and Nagasaki beforehand telling the civilians that we were going to drop massive bombs on them and the Japanese told the civilians to stay because "it was just a scare tactic" 




 Tbh if you're from a country where you're gassing and starving your prisoners and you're given three hots and a cot by your enemy when you're captured you gain a little perspective. 




 Idk the Nazis did some pretty twisted human experimentation too. For example the twin experiments are pretty terrible. They would seperate a set of twins and keep them in separate cells, then they would inject them with various chemicals and inject dyes into their eyes just to see if they would react the same. They would also sewed together twins to try to turn them into conjoined twins... it was some human centipede type shit. They also used jews as lab rats for testing various desalination methods, experiment nerve and bone transplant surgeries, and to test new forms of medicine and first aid they would infect jews with various lethal diseases and then try different ways to cure them or they would inflict phosphorus burns on them so they could try to treat them.

 The same things happen to soldiers. It doesn't matter how much training you have, it can't turn you into a superhuman. There is no way to override the symptoms of an adrenaline dump of that magnitude without tons of real world exposure. To expect police officers, most of whom never draw their weapon in the field during their career, to be able to do something that most experienced soldiers can't even do is ridiculous.  




 It just means that they were using an outdated utility belt layout. Believe it or not, that is not an indicator of a setup. 




 I don't know much about schizophrenia but can't most schizophrenics lead relatively normal lives and get jobs as long as they take their meds? 




 Good man. 




 Idk it depends on where you live. If you're living anywhere in coastal SoCal or in any large city in the northeast then that salary is distinctly middle class/lower middle class with dependants. 




 One of my best friends in HS had that problem. His mom made literally the smallest possible amount to not qualify for SNAP with 2 kids and his life was pretty tough. Luckily his grandparents stepped in and decided to send them 200-300 a month, but his life was still pretty basic. 




 Does he have gov't health insurance/get his schizophrenia meds for free? If not then living on 800 a month and having to pay the copay on those drugs must be a bitch. Honestly I don't even know if that's possible where I live. My rent to share a room in a one bedroom apartment is $600, before utilities. 




 They should also file personal suits against the author and the accuser (if she can even be called that) for everything they can think of. Turn these people into examples. Aside from the damage this did to the fraternity and the brothers who were wrongly accused, this situation also undermines the credibility of real rape victims. This story is exactly the type of thing that perpetuates rape culture. 




 He's purposefully writing in an extreme to highlight the absurdity of some people's opinions. 




 Bullshi. The guy has won a very prestigious award and has a perfect GPA. My guess is that his ACT is perfect and his SAT is perfect  or near perfect. Him being black doesn't negate his accomplishments, and absolutely no amount of affirmative action influence is going to get you into every single Ivy school. If you can get into harvard or yale you can get into any school in the country, that's the truth. 




 Everyone should eventually have a LinkedIn. Best to start now so that you can begin gathering connections.  




 Snakes (and reptiles in general) do not bond to their owners.

Why is that? It seems like we can bond with most other species (with varying degrees of success, but still). What makes reptiles different? 




 No he ran for the same reason that teenagers have been running from police for decades. He didn't want his parents to find out. I highly doubt that a dialogue about corruption and injustice was running through his head. 




 Well we wouldn't want him donning a lab coat because it would hide his physique. We better get him a mesh tank top.

 As the title says I was an unpaid employee at my high school's school store. Duties included cash handling, marketing, and sales. I'm only in college so my experience level is low so I want to add this to my profile but I don't know where.

 They need to have their lowest donation set at like $5 or $10. $22 is more than most like to donate to charities so they really set themselves up for failure. 




 Haha 




 They could always change the name but yeah it sucks for them. 




 The afghanistan war cost 4-6 trillion. That's .01% of the lowest estimated cost. It's a rounding error. 




 Lots of people observe and audit lecture classes. The value of a school like Stanford is in A) the diploma and B) the upper division courses which are not usually lectures. An intro class at Stanford is going to be similar to an intro class at ASU.  




 We're talking about family income though - the parents salaries combined. 125k is 62.5k + 62.5k, or two incredibly average salaries. Six figures is a lot for a single person in their 20s, or even two people in their 20s, but it's not a lot for a family. 




 How likely are they to fill up soon? I cant submit my application until I finish up this term in may because I'm short a few credits.  




 Weigh in course difficulty, extra curriculars, and standardized test scores is probably what I would do. 




 Are they more likely to match me with another sophomore? My biggest thing with the dorms is that my roommate this year is a nightmare so I'm not really feeling another double.  




 I'm an incoming second year from out of state and I don't know anybody. Not really trying to live in the dorms. Are there any apartments that do roommate matching? Also what area would be best to live in? I like being close to restaurants and things and I don't want to live in a social dead zone.

 Adderall is a mixture of levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, meth is... methamphetamine. The difference between them is that methamphetamine binds to one more protein than l-amphetamine and d-amphetamine and that extra protein makes meth directly neurotoxic at any dose whereas adderall is not neurotoxic at approved clinical doses. 




 Yo get a nice dog that you can sleep with while your fam is gone. My lab is the only thing that got me through my depression. 




 By that scale UCSB girls still win lol. Yeah they party (maybe a bit too hard) but UCSB is an extremely good school. We're talking some 4.0 unweighted GPA, 2000+ SAT, 36% acceptance rate type shit. These girls aren't getting in on their looks alone. So, to recap, theyre hot af, smart af, and fun af.  




 Here's a video of [a party at UW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceE2ETeqecc). The girls are cute. I'd say mostly solid 7s but not 8-11s lol. 

For comparison here's a video of [a party at UC Santa Barbara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMPP-FrAx0k) [Hella NSFW]. UCSB is putting up hotter girls breh 




 My sense is that most people that are involved enough in the satanic church (or any religion) that they would do something like that don't own a business that is big enough to matter.  




 No, accreditation is just a baseline. Universities here in California usually audit classes at community colleges to determine if they should accept them. [Here's the course list for SBCC](https://bannerportal.sbcc.edu/pls/prod/pw_pub_sched.p_search) (#1 CC in the US) if you click the CRN # for a course it will tell you if it's transferable to a UC or CSU. Most aren't transferable to UC schools even if they transfer to a CSU. 




 Well that's true of really any CC. There are very few career fields nowadays where an associates will actually get you a job. Almost every entry level position with potential for lateral movement lists bachelor or higher as a req. 




 In state at a UC school is like 10k a year before other expenses. It ends up being around 30k with everything factored in. 




 "Aren't all that respected" lol they're absolutely useless for white collar jobs. No hiring manager is going to hire someone with a finance/accounting/cs/engineering/whatever degree from U of P when they've got kids coming out of schools like UCLA or NYU that are desperate for jobs. 




 I'm paying 32k in tuition  (before other expenses) to attend a UC school as an out of state student. My parents make 200k combined with one other kid in high school. I get no assistance. Even though my parents fot the bill for upper middle class, my tuition is a significant burden on them. The American higher education system is fucked up. The sticker price for my degree will be $200k. 




 But you can't look at college athletes as a whole because unless they're delusional, nobody is tossing their eggs in the pro sports bucket unless they're a starter on a top division 1 team. For most people that do college sports they're doing it because they love their sport and they'll probably get a scholarship. 




 Most sports programs, even successful div one football programs do not make the university any money. Most schools that aren't in the top 10-15 for football revenue are either losing money or bringing in less than 5m a year.

 Jesus christ she was 27 in 1915. Imagine how amazing it would be to be born in a world where most people had never seen a car or a telephone or even a light bulb, and then die ib a world where self driving cars are being invented and people can access the internet from their cell phones.

 So what's the best way to store my board in my checked bag so that the TSA and the baggage handlers don't fuck it up? Heading home for spring break later this week and would like to bring my board. 




 This season suuuuuuckeeeed  




 Bruh the 80s ended 25 years ago. Listen to the classics not a weird ass modern reincarnation of an 80s funk band. 




 I chose songs from auto tuned albums (although did you listen to Never Let Me Down?)but he has plenty of non auto tune as well. Ex: [The Joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI0KVUwgE_E), [Through the Wire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrJK5owl8PU) (He recorded that with his mouth wired shut after a near fatal car accident), and [Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc65hFCls8E) 




 Because he's innovative. He's a rapper but he makes so much more. I mean, take [Street Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnTFdZSVyO4) for example. What is that? It's not rap, it's not rock, it's not pop, it doesn't really fit into any conventional genre. Same with [Lost in the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyQpQhrQ5Zs) (NSFW album cover), yeah it's got rap in it but it's not really a rap song. He's also the only artist that has been able to completely change their style for every album and still be successful. Listen to the polarity between [Never Let Me Down from The College Dropout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgtZHXEmvFQ), [Welcome to Heartbreak from 808s and Heartbreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaSopljm410), [Stronger from Graduation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g), and [Send it Up from Yeezus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbLkHhxK-lk). He has an innate ability to successfully change his style and still make good music. When most artists try to change their style they royally fuck up and lose fans. 




 After "fighting" the munchies a few times I don't get them when I smoke, but whenever I eat after smoking it sort of resets everything and I get the munchies after I smoke. It's kinda weird. 




 That's  Dr thugmoney to you 




 Dude you're really young to be messing with this type of stuff. Hold off, enjoy childhood and young adulthood, and then start messing with things again when your brain has less developing to do.  




 Get a test kit from dance safe 




 Thanks. I'm just wrapping up my freshman year now, second half of the second semester at my school. I got B's and B+s last semester and it looks like I'll be getting a couple A's and a couple B's this semester. My fear is that I'm not sure I'm going to pass the math class I'm in and it's worth 5 credits. Am I basically fucked for getting into Kelley if I don't pass? I switched it to P/NP grading but I'm still not 100% sure I can pass. I'm taking 18 credits so I'm hoping that they'll take that into account while considering me. 




 Ayyyy thanks, yeah skateboards. So my cousin is 11 and I'd really like to avoid taking him to a smoke shop so is there another place you can recommend? Or is the smoke shop portion seperated from the skate shop? 




 I've been eyeing the finance mahor at Kelley as well as the economic consulting major. How difficult is it to gain admittance? I've also been looking at the investment banking workshop and seminar, how difficult are those to  get into? Thanks guys. 




 I've heard it can make it feel speedy. The main thing is that Wellbutrin lowers your seizure threshold as do amphetamines, so the combination can give you a seizure in medium to high doses of both. 




 Visiting my cousin pretty soon and I'm supposed to help him pick a longboard. Would rather keep it local than go to muirskate. 




 How does MDMA and Wellbutrin interact? I'm on Wellbutrin currently and I've been told to avoid MDMA because it will just feel speedy and I won't actually roll. 




 There are a few non-SSRIs anti-depressants that fuck with mdma too. Wellbutrin being a prime example. 




 When did we decide as a society that an adults life is more important than that of a child?

We didn't. But an innocent adult shouldn't have to die because a kid stole his parent's gun and decided to take it to the park. I agree that shooting a child should be the absolute last resort but you can't honestly blame a cop for doing it if the kid starts waving a gun in their direction. 




 if the genders in this case were swapped the sentence would have been the same or longer

Idk about that. Granted this is just for New Jersey but the longest sentence a male teacher has gotten in NJ history is 10 years, 7 for a female teacher.

http://gothamist.com/2013/04/29/male_teachers_get_longer_sentences.php

Also it couldn't have been longer because 15 years is the maximum sentence in a case like this. 




 For real. I've taken like 20mg at once and never experienced a lucid dream.

 As long as we're speaking of modafinil, I noticed that modafinilcat was added to the reliable vendors list so I went and checked out /r/modafinilcat. For the most part everything seemed like it was on the up and up but I noticed a bit of astroturfing. Since their web design is kind of reminiscent of modup's I thought it seemed kinda fishy.

Specifically these posts (note the OP's post history):

 Haha you weren't kidding 




 The problem is that LE in the southern states has a history of sweeping this stuff under the rug. It is better for the FBI to just handle it than for the law enforcement in Mississippi to rule it a suicide and tamper with the evidence. 




 As of now, none. But if it wasn't suicide then he was hanged and when a black man is hanged in the south it is very reminiscent of a lynching 




 From the original wiki:

On October 28, 2009 President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, attached to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which expanded existing United States federal hate crime law to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity. 




 If he didn't commit suicide he was murdered. If it was in fact a murder, the method in combination with it taking place in Mississippi is very reminiscent of a lynching. Local law enforcement in southern states has a long history of ruling racially motivated killings as suicide. It's just better for the FBI to make the determination of whether this is a suicide because they're not likely to sweep a lynching under the rug. 




 That act removed the prerequisite that the victim had to be engaging in a federally protected activity at the time of their death for the feds to get involved. 




 And that is precisely why the FBI is handling this investigation  




 Casinos don't really dispense this type of justice nowadays. He'd just be blackballed if he was caught card counting. 




 what's the grounds for federal jurisdiction of any kind?

[The civil rights act of 1964](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime_laws_in_the_United_States)

Although state laws vary, current statutes permit federal prosecution of hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's protected characteristics of **race**, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.

Considering the geographic location of Mississipi and its history of racism if this isn't a suicide then it's a hate crime. Local law enforcement agencies in southern states do not have a good reputation when it comes to investigating and prosecuting hate crimes so it's best that the FBI handles the entirety of the case.

 




 No they shouldn't. This is perfectly legal. The civil rights act of 1964 gave the FBI authority to investigate any racially motivated crime against anyone attempting to perform one of six federally protected activities. A 2009 amendment signed into law by Obama removed the prerequisite that the victim had to be engaging in a federally protected activity for the FBI to get involved. Considering the culture of a place like Mississippi it is better for the FBI to be on scene from the get go before evidence is tampered with. 




 What'd your doctor prescribe it for? 




 I'm assuming this is not legally possible but it'd be amazing if you could test modafinil samples from various vendors  




 What's the song playing in the background when frank and dee walk into the apartment in the beginning? 




 The problem with that is that there's no way to reliably account for something like that. You can say X% of companies go under due to fraud or other out of market forces but there's no way to say which companies will do that. From an investing standpoint the chances that you'll pick a fraudulent blue chip company are too low to justify the lowered rates of ROI from diversifying beyond 25-30 stocks. It's not possible to invest with meaningful returns without risk. obviously there's no reason to start spending significant amounts of money buying up penny stocks, but within reason higher risk=higher potential returns. 




 but there comes a point when adding more stocks to your portfolio ceases to make a difference. There is a debate over how many stocks are needed to reduce risk while maintaining a high return. The most conventional view argues that an investor can achieve optimal diversification with only 15 to 20 stocks spread across various industries.

 August Busch the 4th. He was handed the CEO-ship of Anheuser-Busch and arguably ran the company into the ground.

He wasnt just "handed" the company. He had worked in various positions for nearly 20 years (1989-2006) before he was selected by the then president (who was not a member of the busch family) to be his successor. Your idea that he ran the business into the ground is a bit odd. Yes, he was unable to hold onto the business but he sold it for $20/share above wjat the record highest share value of the company was, so it's not like he lost his family or shareholders any money. If anything they turned a significant profit.

Ivy level education: 

Cheating is prevalent at any university, whether it's through the use of amphetamines or through collaboration on take home exams. Grade inflation is an interesting topic when you're talking anout Ivy schools and it certainly needs to be addressed, but the fact remains that even getting into an Ivy school is a feat of it's own. Nobody going to harvard can be called lazy or stupid. 

MBA programs: 

If you're not attending a top 15 MBA program then you shouldnt be paying for an MBA program. Every top ranked MBA program (with the exception of harvard iirc) requires that you have at least 4 years of experience prior to enrollment. Eneolling in any old MBA program because  "that's just what you do" isnt going to help you. The type of people that can get into a good MBA program are destined to be execs of large companies, so attending a program like that essentially gives them 5-10 years of experience worth of management knowledge in 3-4 years. It also lets you network with other future execs. Any old MBA program won't do that for you.

 Holding individual stocks is more akin to gambling than investing

Not really. If you have 16 blue chip stocks in various unrelated industries then safety wise your portfolio is as diverse as one that has 50 stocks. 




 Mdma is a weird drug. It's not a stimulant in the same sense that coke and other amphetamines are stimulants. If you're taking real MDMA and you're not taking anything that'll interact with it then it shouldn't feel speedy or edgy or anything like that. You start out feeling a rush but then that sort of goes away and you start "peaking" which makes you feel euphoric and happy. The come down can be kind of rough but that can be mitigated with various vitamins and supplement. A lot of people get an "after glow" ranging from a few days to a few weeks that can make you feel happier and more empathetic. 




 The problem with a test kit is that it's not a mass spec. It just tells you what the majority chemical in the substance is so it could've been 50%mdma 25%mda 25%meth. Along the same lines, the most dangerous adulterant in mdma is PMA which has no reaction so you could've taken MDA MDMA OR MDE and PMA. 




 He'll always be the weird yin yang guy from psych to me 




 I feel like a lot of people that make comments like the on you're replying to are forgetting that police officers have unions. That alone makes it an astronomical task to fire a bad officer without incredibly solid evidence. 




 It's weird because he's good enough on modern family that even though I watch both shows pretty regularly I can never picture him playing the other role until I switch over and I'm like ohhhh right 




 At that level nothing is just handed to you. Yes, some of them may have inherited the job but they still needed to complete an Ivy level education and most likely make it through a decent MBA program. Their dad wouldn't have given them the position if they were a failure. If you're unaware of what exactly a fortune 500 company is, it's a top 500 performing *public or closely held corporation*. No stock broker worth their salt is going to keep their clients money in the stock of a company that just made a coked out retard the CEO. And nobody with stock in a closely held corporation is going to let a coked out retard become the CEO. Blaming nepotism or cronyism for your own professional inadequacies is a cop out. Nobody is going to hire you for being average. If you want to work in the world of high level corporate america then you can't just sit on your ass through college, you need to get a kick ass GPA so you look good to recruiters, and you need to befriend as many people as possible because when you're talking about positions that can make or break a company people hire people that they know and can trust, not just people that look good on paper.

Edit: Yes, down vote me because  I'm not going to pat you on the back and say the only reason they're ahead of you in life is because they cheated. 




 Do you care if they look bunched around the waist area? If not then get whatever you think will fit your legs and tighten the shit out of the draw string 




 And all women are cheating backstabbers? 




 It's called networking. Joining a frat is a great way to get a nice network with minimum effort. Do you think the 15% of fortune 500 execs that aren't greek just sat around and played video games with some burnouts in college or do you think they went out most weekends and befriended a large group of people? 




 Maybe they'd all be snipped before heading up there. 




 So what you're saying is that there have only been two accidents since 1990 and none since 2003? 




 Nah I got the SC because my friend offered me a pretty good price for the LY and I needed something smaller, not because I just wanted something different. I'll be taking the tugboat off my flair as soon as his paycheck comes in  




 bearings swapped out?

Yep haha I'm coming off of 8 hours of studying for finals so I'm a bit fried. Yeah it might be because the only board I've ever ridden is the tugboat that I think the sc is super carvy 




 It's the whole set up. Bullet B137 trucks, road rider 68mm 78a wheels, and I want to say a 1/4" riser pad. I definitely prefer the santa cruz. It's way more carvey. My biggest quam with the tugboat is that the kicktail takes up like a quarter of board so if you want to shift your weight during a long ride you need to be sure your foot isn't behind the rear truck. I will say that the trucks that came with the SC weren't that great and I switched them out for some reds. 




 How do you guys feel about Santa Cruz boards? I got a land shark about a week ago and I love it. Kind of curious why I never see it recommended (as opposed to the Dinghy which seems to be the go to) here when people are asking for a small commuter board? 




 She's a cheap knockoff of nicki minaj 




 Chronysim are a huge part of life. Lose that lottery and you're screwed.

*Cronyism isn't part of some lottery. Networking is just as important as school itself. If you're running some fortune 500 company are you going to hire the guy that looks slightly better on paper or are you going to hire the guy that looks good on paper AND that you know personally and can trust? People like you are part of the problem in this country. You didn't get ahead because you didn't play the game and now you're complaining that life is unfair because you weren't automatically rewarded for being average. 




 There are also plans to reopen the desalination plant in Santa Barbara County. 




 I've been to Hawaii a few times. You can get around the perimeter of the islands via bus usually but if you want to go anywhere specific you'll need a car. A good deal of Hawaii is still jungle so they don't really need to send buses everywhere. That said, I don't believe that there's any island-island public transpo so save some cash for a ferry if you think you'll want to go to other islands. 




 I didn't know that was saul until you just said it was saul. Guess I wasn't paying attention. 




 Nooooo 




 I recently got a Santa Cruz land shark and I reaaaallyyyy like it. They're 120 off of tactic. Super carvy and super smooth. Not much of a kicktail though. I want to say that they're 278.7 and they weigh in around 6.5lbs.  




 It's funny just let it be you douche 




 That's because people who say shit like /r/hailcorporate or /r/thathappened are annoying as fuck.  




 24 bruh. he hadn't had food for 24 hours. 




 The finale could end with walt and jesse showing up for the first time I guess, but that's the only thing I can think of. 




 Eh it's not even worth it. You need a LOT of this stuff to make even one shot of vodka. Like each packet is equivalent to a single shot. 




 God I hope she doesn't win though. Like real talk, if the US feels that it needs a woman president so bad that it won't take anyone else can we at least get someone besides her to do it?  




 Now you need to decide if you're going to leverage this information 




 I think it does work like that in Russia, not quite sure though, but in the US iirc the president, vice president, and base commander all have to input their launch keys simultaneously. 




 Because in sports betting you don't bet on the team just winning, you bet on the spread. So if the odds are 3:1 or whatever that the team will either lose or win with a 7 point spread then it would benefit him more to keep his team from winning by more than 7 points than actually just winning all out.  




 In a group yes, in singularity, much less so. People like Putin and Obama get to their positions because they are smart. No matter how corrupt they get, and how many terrible decisions they make, they are smart enough to know not to push the big red button. 




 No you can tell because the cop is dressed like a school crossing guard 




 Well the jacket ways "policia" so this was probably in central/south America, so A) I doubt there are many meth labs around to bust, and B) If it is a commercial grow op then it's probably tied to a cartel. 




 I don't think a lot of people living in LA actually realize they're living in a desert. 









 Ninkasi or die 




 Yeah here they just require that you have an offsite advisor  that's an alumni of the organization. Usually it's just a random brother that's sticking around for a year after graduation. 




 Every sorority does, that's for sure. But none of the frats my friends are in have one. (Alpha Tau, Beta theta, Sigma nu) 




 It depends. Only one of the frats on my campus has any sort of help. The rest of them allocate cooking and cleaning among the brothers. 




 What kind of frat has a house mother? No wonder these guys are assholes. They were probably babied their whole life. 




 I think what's suspicious for a lot of people is that two different SAE chapters that are a decent distance apart have been reported using the same chant. If it was two racist chapters using separate chants it wouldn't be as big a deal, but somebody from SAE nationals is teaching them this chant. 




 And sprite refers to sipping on that lean 




 He's not talking about mixing it with booze haha 




 Nobody I just couldn't think of another way to phonetically differentiate 




 So a chemist would pronounce it as un-ion-ized. Because in that context they're talking about ions. A plumber would pronounced it as you-neon-ized because they'd  be talking about a workers union. 




 Thank you! 




 I'm trying to figure out if I can cut it in half. Drugs.com says that it's 10mg of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine manufactured by aurolife pharma 




 What I want to know is how they find stuff like this? I mean you'd think someone wouldve thrown it away before an investigator came across it and decided it was worth looking into 




 ;) 




 So over the course of my first year of college I've lost about 50 pounds which is amazing! What's even better is that the cute girls have started talking to me! However, while I've downsized my entire wardrobe I haven't bought new boxers because a lot of them still fit due to the elastic waistband. Well last thursday I was in a rush to get to class so I grabbed a random pair of boxers and threw on a pair of shorts and ran out the door. Now, this is key, my dorm is far enough from the main campus that people either ride bikes or take the bus to class. I decided to take the bus on this particular day. I take my seat and at the next stop a 10/10 sorority girl (Alpha Phi, yeah, this is serious business) sits down next to me. I mustered up some courage and decided to start talking to her. Surprisingly enough we hit it off and by the time we get to campus I'm making her laugh. Now this is wear the fuck up happens. When I sat down on the bus my boxers must have slid below my belt because the moment I step off the bus I feel them start slipping. What's even worse is that it turns out this girl is in the lecture I'm going to and we've still got a half a mile to walk. We walk a bit further and these things are going. I'm doing my best to hold on to them through my pocket without looking awkward as hell but it's not going well. We walk a bit further and that's when it happens, I lose control and now my boxers are just resting on the crotch of my shorts. I look down and you can see them hanging through the leg holes of my shorts. I look like some retarded gangster that's doing a reverse sag look. At this point I'm just praying this girl doesn't look down. 

This is when I luck out, I see a couple of my friends a ways away and I text both of them "911 need wingman asap." Now these guys are pros, they start walking over without hesitation, and when they get close enought see her aphi shirt they know that this isn't some joke. I gestured at my shorts and they leapt into action. They say what's up to me and introduce themselves to her and then distract her for just long enough for me to step behind her and reach into my pants and pull my boxers up. Now, to anyone else in the area this probably looked weird as fuck, but again this girl IS A MOTHER FUCKING ALPHA PHI, and desperation measures needed to be taken. I mean you show me a campus where aphis aren't the hottest girls. The wingman intervention was a successful and I sat next to her all through the lecture and I've got plans to hang out with her and some of her sisters this weekend. 

**TL;DR** boxers fell down so far they were visibly below my shorts while I was talking to a hot as fuck girl, friends intervened with a distraction, and I successfully fixed boxers and got girls number. 




 I'm partial to the bobby vena remix but to each their own 




 C'mon dude... I know that we're very liberal about drug use on /r/drugs (go figure,right?) but don't say it's no big deal when you're talking about heroin. Heroin is a very big deal and you need to be very sure about your self control to even consider trying it. 




 Due to the location of my university I'm friends with a lot of kids from rich areas of Los Angeles. I know for a fact that most of them get their coke and molly in person from dealers. The difference between their dealers and dealers in the poorer neighborhoods is that their dealer is only once or twice removed from the trafficker. Whereas in the poorer neighborhoods the coke may have gone through 10 different dealers before it reaches the street level dealer. 




 snoo is my guess 




 I feel you but at the same time there is a line. Take my roommate for example. He's on his PC from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed with a small break for school. He neglects taking care of himself, he showers maybe once every week or two, and he hasn't socialized with anyone irl besides me and the friends I bring home since the beginning of the school year. His only form of social interaction is when he's playing steam with his friends from high school. In some ways he's worse than a functional alcoholic. His mouse broke about a month ago and he literally went through withdrawals while he was waiting for a new one. And yet in his twisted little mind he thinks that what he's doing is morally superior and healthier than me going out and getting fucked up with my friends every weekend.

Yes you should respect other people's lifestyles, but at the same time denying that there's such a thing as too much computer time is wrong too.  




 Is that legal? Doesn't Oklahoma have any laws regarding eviction notice periods? 




 Well no but they try to rush an amount that wouldn't lead to competition to live in the house. So enough that youve got a sizeable pledge class, but not so many that even if 20% of each class decides to live out you have to raffle out rooms. If you're rushing 20 pledges twice a year and you've only got 25 bedrooms you're going to have issues, even if you have a senior house.  




 SAE has the most actives. Among other frats they're generally considered a joke because they rush way too many people to live in the house so their sense of brotherhood is diminished. 




 I'm not sure I believe you.... when a frat loses their chapter they're allowed to stay in the house through the end of the school year. Unless when you say moving their stuff out you mean removing the letters from the house. 




 I've got a skatetool but I somehow lost the screwdriver that came with it :/ 




 I don't have a screw driver with me in my dorm 




 Does anyone know if boards from Tactics come assembled?
