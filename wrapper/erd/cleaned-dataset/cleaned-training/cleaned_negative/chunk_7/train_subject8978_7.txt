 If you haven't seen [Death Wish 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0ZP4S3xZgE), you don't know what a good bad movie is. A crappy 80s sequel that turns out to be a complete masterpiece of hackery. Absolute Must See, better than every flick mentioned in the post.

 It's a really fun game and one that really rewards getting good at it. Once you're actually good at it and can pull off the various moves easily, it becomes quite the cinematic experience and more fun. Plus shooting people from a distance in slow-mo never gets tired. Have fun!
 




 I love this Harold Bloom quote about it:

"The first time I read Blood Meridian, I was so appalled that while I was held, I gave up after about 60 pages. I dont think I was feeling very well then anyway; my health was going through a bad time, and it was more than I could take. But it intrigued me, because there was no question about the quality of the writing, which is stunning. So I went back a second time, and I got, I dont remember 140, 150 pages, and then, I think it was the Judge who got me. He was beginning to give me nightmares just as he gives the kid nightmares."

 




 That book is a joy compared to Blood Meridian. 




 Say what you want about Lennox Lewis, the man was a great champion. He may not have been the most exciting fighter but he was patient, fought his way to the top, put up with a lot of shit and when he finally got his chance, cleared up the Heavyweight division. He beat Holyfield, Tyson and Klitschko. I always loved his [knockout against Michael Grant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpdGFK_mqZI).

 It's hyped beyond all belief, to be sure, but it is quite excellent.

 *"The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population."*

 I've been obsessed with this movie for a while, probably seen it a dozen times. Really worth watching the whole thing. A note about [Castle Bravo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEje927dygM) that always blows my mind:

 I think it was something to do with the simplicity of the story: get to the space hospital to cure the radiation. Not exactly the most compelling story.

 Garrison was a nutjob. Watch [Oswald's Ghost](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/oswald/). Garrison was certifiable and the majority of his "evidence" was useless conjecture. So Clay worked with the CIA? So what? The Kennedy Assassination is a million pieces of string that go nowhere. Fifty years later, still no hard evidence, just "Clay worked with the CIA" or "Oswald went to Russia." Yes, yes, but so what? Now that we know that, what do we know? As for the HSCA, here's an excerpt from an excellent [interview with Gerald Posner](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html):

**Q: Can you explain what the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1978-79) found out in the acoustic evidence, and what happened afterward concerning the issue of the reliability of the evidence?**

*A: "The House Select Committee on Assassinations used sound experts to listen to a Dallas police Dictabelt. They concluded with a 95 percent certainty that there was a fourth shot fired at Dealey Plaza, and it came from the grassy knoll. The National Academy of Sciences reviewed their work and found a multitude of errors and omissions. The most serious of which was that at the time that the Select Committee experts thought the shots were, [it] actually, [was] one minute after the assassination had actually taken place. Dealey Plaza is a veritable echo chamber, and it makes it very difficult sometimes to analyze the acoustic testimony. However, by looking at the statements of a witness who gave an opinion as to the source of the shots, we can see certain trends. Eighty-eight percent of the 179 witnesses who expressed an opinion said there were three shots and three shots only. The largest group that identified a location, 28 percent, said they came from the book depository. Only four witnesses, 2 percent of all the witnesses at Dealey, heard shots coming from more than one location."*


Check out the whole interview, it's quite good. And really, Oswald's Ghost is excellent as well.
 




 Americans love their conspiracy theories, but I have to say, Oswald did it. After fifty years there is no hard evidence of a conspiracy to kill JFK, but a mountain of evidence that says Oswald acted alone.
 




 It's right on the first page of his letter.
 




 Exactly what it's supposed to do:

The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. 
 









 Seems like a lot of people have trouble getting into it the first time, including [Harold Bloom](http://www.avclub.com/articles/harold-bloom-on-blood-meridian,29214/):

"The first time I read Blood Meridian, I was so appalled that while I was held, I gave up after about 60 pages. I dont think I was feeling very well then anyway; my health was going through a bad time, and it was more than I could take. But it intrigued me, because there was no question about the quality of the writing, which is stunning. So I went back a second time, and I got, I dont remember 140, 150 pages, and then, I think it was the Judge who got me. He was beginning to give me nightmares just as he gives the kid nightmares. And then the third time, it went off like a shot. I went straight through it and was exhilarated. I said, My God! This reminds me of Thomas Pynchon at his best, or Nathanael West. It was the greatest single book since Faulkners As I Lay Dying. In fact, I taught it for several years in a class I gave here at Yaleinterestingly enough, in a sequence starting with Faulkners As I Lay Dying, moving on to Miss Lonelyhearts, then The Crying of Lot 49, and the fourth in the sequence was Blood Meridian." 




 IMHO, one of the greatest speeches of the twentieth century, rivals anything by MLK, JFK, Gandhi or Churchill. A truly powerful moment.

 I've been looking into the Kennedy Assassination for over a year now. In my mind, there's simply no doubt that Oswald did it. Fifty years after the assassination there is absolutely no hard evidence of a conspiracy whatsoever. But there is a mountain of evidence against Oswald. Some good resources:

 My guess: Willy is gonna die.

They've sort of set him up as a quasi-Jimmy Darmody. Now that he's mixed up with gangsters, he's going to have some serious problems. I think they're foreshadowing it with Willy staying in Eddie's room. Now, with the Feds on Eli, Willy is directly mixed up in everything. We know that if Nucky has to kill Willy to save himself, he will. Plus, it would just be so incredibly tragic for Eli, it's the thing he cares about and when Nucky finds out Eli is ratting on him (and he will), Nucky will do whatever it takes to save himself, even if it means killing his brother's son, or letting him die. FWIW, the last episode of the season is called "Farewell Daddy Blues".
