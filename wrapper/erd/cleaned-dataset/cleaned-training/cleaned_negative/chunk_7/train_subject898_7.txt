 You know MODS, on a less serious subreddit called /r/games they put little things above links that are hearsay, such as "UNSUBSTANTIATED" and "BULLSHIT". Even tho I'm sure the french attacks were some sort of government ploy.

 Haha no worries, totally understandable  




 I'm just imaging, for asmr, it could be a role play and the sounds picked up as a the balloons rub together could be popular lol 














 I was worried it would be a video of the actual "devouring". Glad it wasn't. Feel bad for the kid, but, based on piranha eating habits, the body was most likely previously deceased (maybe drowning?) and eaten post-mortem - as piranha, even within large groups, are primarily scavengers.

 Pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our consciences, but shouts in our pains. It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.

makes me sick 









 She wants to date, but like others have said, I don't want to get into anything and back out and hurt her. 




 I met this really fantastic girl a while ago, we immediately hit it off, as she was boisterous, excitable and able to have a conversation without awkwardness or judgement. We're both Christians with a strong understanding of the message of Christ and both work in the same field, so we get to spend some time together pretty frequently. I felt immediately comfortable around her which is really nice. 

I've had people within the same circle of friends come up to me in conversation and borderline bug as to why we aren't dating and how she "screams 'my' girlfriend". 

The only issue is, I just don't feel the sensation you would when looking at someone physically beautiful, and I fear that makes me superficial. Is it wrong to have all other aspects of a christian relationship line up perfectly, but turn it down because the physical attraction is not? 

I've prayed about it for a while, and I would never want to get into something that I'm not at least all on board for, because I'd never want to end up hurting someone. I've read scripture that "beauty is fleeting and charm is deceptive, but a woman who fears the lord is to be held high", but maybe I'm not mature enough in my life right now to fully accept that. I don't know.  




 got em 



















 If you don't get in, which, as you've stated, is a possibility - don't give up on life. It may be a doorway to an unhindered sense of freedom you may have never known before if you didn't waste your entire life worrying about what your parents or other people thought about you. Think about all those bankers who TRIED SO HARD their entire lives, to get to the top, and find that there is nothing there for them except for the superficial numerical value next to their name. The second that plummets, they do as well off the 33rd story of their high rise apartment. The point is, fuck this stupid world and its expectations. You have a chance here to not give two shits for once and that is a weight that only the great have had lifted from their overburdened shoulders. Be free, my friend.  





























 Thank you so much, friend. 




 haha no worries! What story would you enjoy read? :) 














 haha some early blunders (esp part 2 lol), but really trying to pick it up. posting a star wars fan fiction in just a bit if you're interested. Darth Maul's in this one.

 Thanks friend! Any suggestions or requests are greatly appreciated 


































 Kill this man! Hand sanitation so highly important that the thought of someone I will never meet not doing it appropriately drives me to the brink of fedora induced nausea.  




 Yes, makes you ponder intelligent design, God, that sort of thing. Almost too great to be coincidence and chance.   




 This is a little farfetched but I had an idea I wanted to share -

IF time travel were possible, could it be a possibility that the locations and time frames the individual is travelling to could actually be one of the infinite and varying parallel universes all coexisting within the same conscious reality? This is with the perspective that all time is is one moment, and all those one moments exist all on top of each other but in infinite characteristics, times and variations.

This is somewhat String Theory-esque but I wanted to hear some insightful opinions. Thank you.

 No one will ever understand your difficulty in taking a human life. Being able to articulate the feeling with you, will prove even more difficult. Your commanding officer reaches his hand down, placing it on your shoulder. In your daze, you feel an understanding resonate through his touch. Transmitted through his neural fibers to your own is the momentary revelation that you required from another human. You stand to witness the presence of the man's mother fall and engulf your victims body in a protective hysterical shell. To see the judgement and sadness in her eyes would be the end of your soul. You turn and fall back into line. 














 At first I thought you were joking because it was the exact argument that was made in the video lol

 I wonder why this guy is so adamant about something so unobtrusive to his own life?  



















 I understand you emotions my friend. Some of your statements I'll chock up to poetry before God. You are trying so hard to be heard by others, loved, but also loved by God, many of the old testament writers shared your exact same pain, but within different context. I struggle with the desire to be accepted by woman, and it seems like a lot of guys experience acceptance on a regular basis, whether from their girl friend or various co-ed friends etc. But, at the end of the day, the only one that will fill the hole in your heart will be Jesus. Seek after him with all your heart. Join a bible study, a men's group, go evangelize and help people with your new found brethren and sisters, serving Christ as a community. God wants you to focus first on Him, because if he gives you a female, there's a possibility, in your passion, you may lose touch with your need for God and place her on a pedestal that will only collapse around. Let God be your strong and mighty foundation, brother! YOU ARE A MAN! A Man of God! A lover of souls and brokenhearted. You love them because you know the brokenness!

 Purgatory is not overtly mentioned in the bible and is contradictory to the finality of Christ's Sacrifice.

 Maybe I'm struggling with some psychological perspective that my distaste for services that I continue to participate in is what God does not appreciate. Maybe, I need to experience God through a differing manner than your common church service/worship service.  




 Exactly. My conspiratorial side makes me ponder some strange top-down marketing scheme.

 I like Sufjan 




 So, its more of an intellectual decision than sensation experienced? or? 




 Man made tradition of 1.) arrive 2.) greet 3.) announcements 4.) offering 5.) praise music 6.) sermon 7.) praise music 8.) leave.

This isn't inherently a bad thing. It just can become very stagnant and doesn't seem to leave much room for growth, progression or the Holy Spirit.  




 I think, it would seem, that most praise music played within the church, fits within the paradigm or genre of contemporary bands such as Hillsong and I feel as if though that it is very limiting. 




 It is becoming as such, yes.  




 I know, that's kinda what I've been struggling with. /r/videos doesn't seem to care, this subreddit seemed appropriate for the content, /r/ASMR likes tingle voices but only if I speak slow and make p-p-pop noises. My go to's have been /r/history sometimes, /r/creepyreadings for creepypastas and /r/audiobooksonyoutube for short stories. Who knows lol. Figured I'll just keep pumping out content until it builds up slowly or PewDiePie finds me and makes a react video of my creepypastas haha 




 I've come to find that I'm far more passionate and, what I feel is, closer to God when I'm passionately singing a song that I truly enjoy. Hymnals and contemporary rock music just doesn't seem to raise my spirit like, what it seems for, others around me. It's gone as far as making me not look forward to church, as I know that I'm only going to be faking my way through the worship and praise portion and just end up feeling indifferent and bored by the time we reach the message/sermon portion. Does there really need to be a "set list" of praise songs that each worship band needs to know? Isn't that commercialization, if we're just singing 'Hillsong' every week? Similar to man-made traditions that God seems to disdain, in the bible, we in westernized Christianity, seem to be "religiously" following a set path each week when it comes to something as simple as worshiping God. It almost feels as if there is an insinuation that there are no other options aside from this routine and I feel we are overdue for some much needed deviations.    




 Thanks :) Will do! Any other suggestions are most welcome

 A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover. Some call it the thief, as it drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. When it does come, it's always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together in peace for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's Passing Eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and in others, the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the Sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. Some even believe the vibratory luminescence can evoke an inner potential. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime. 

 Sheol and I lay under the aquatic nightlight, overlooking our village  of which is celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights give illusion that the night's excitement is nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrates our sky. The blue bulb emanates such an energy, causing a sense of invigoration through its very presence . Away from all the festival cheer, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. Resting next to one another, hands grasped, I can feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.

 "They say it's getting closer, you know, Sheol gently let out. In my hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.

 "Uh... You don't buy into that collision course fear do you?" I rattle off in nearly the same words I've heard from my pop time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky. 

 "I don't know...My father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's different." Her gaze never breaks from the atmosphere, and I have no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The event. Silence fills the air as what she said begins to pass over me. 
 
 Fireworks can be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brings a smile to my face. We lay there quietly, looking directly at what some hold in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not overtaken me. I know I am exactly where I'm supposed to be. Sheol clasps my hand even tighter  her vision transfixed towards the endless blue; and all I can hear is that gentle hum.

 I am simply stating that your examination and observation of the world is gonna be biased and contradictory, no matter your stance. You only can be sure of the time in which you were born and died, never being a first hand account, or authority to past or future.  




 Basically, its the age old internet argument that if you killed your grandfather, you would never be born. Therefore, he believes (most likely based on the Reddit hivemind Sagan-Degrasse Tyson indoctrination) that if Moses would have been killed, the Jews would never have been freed, Jesus would have never been born, christianity would have never developed, science would be praised, and we'd be on Mars right now with robots that would jerk us off on command. But, that's taking into consideration that there would be NO other religions to come into existence during that time (thus forwarding 'progress'), over analyzing that religion is a hindrance in the first place, and that humans could ever, or will ever progress to this hypothetical "stage II" society. 

End of the day. The kid most likely hated church growing up, felt some sort of enlightenment by browsing reddit, and now holds science to be the new god (that holds him to no social standard) of whom he puts his faith daily
