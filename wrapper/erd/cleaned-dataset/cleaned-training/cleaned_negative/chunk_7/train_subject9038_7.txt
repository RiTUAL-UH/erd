 What? 




 No money for parts. Paying for fitness. I'm good with my old friend from 2007 (computer) but thanks for the advice :D 




 Thanks for all the advice.  I'm currently in EU Ring Of Fire and just a few mins ago I created a Sylvary Guardian - hope I didn't get the name of the race wrong. When I saw the guardian in the shining armour I just said this is the new beginning.  So yeah
