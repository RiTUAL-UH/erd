 It makes me sad that so many talented performers get paid so little and treated so poorly while bringing so much joy.

 He's pretty laidback. It's actually the third wedding they've had. The first time they eloped and her parents in Europe got annoyed so they had a second one. This is the third one for the Australians. 

 




 The invite didn't mention dress code or even what type of function it is. Usually I'd suit up so that is out. 

What should I wear? 




 shhh, don't scare them. 




 As a part of building my brand I'm keen to build my indentity as an authority. By creating a website with strong content, I'll get more people knowing who I am and what I do. They'll also link to my content and help my SEO.

The same goes for Social Media. A lot of my customers know me from social media interactions. I'd like the site to feed the social media and visa versa.

People find the site via a) seeing  me at gigs and in the media and b) links to content on social media c) googling my keywords.

I'm pretty good at SEO. I got my crappy old WIX site to number three on google from the seventh page in six weeks. 




 Meh

 




 Come back han! 




 I hate when I read back my old comments and realise that I was the one who was wrong and wasn't listening.  




 I want to punch you in the face and I know you're only giving an example.

 Thanks! That is super helpful. 

For me, I'd say my goals are:-

1) Increase overall number of visitors to my website.

2) Increase visitors requesting more information on my services as an entertainer/speaker for corporate and private functions.

3) Increase sales of my novel.

4) Reflect my personality and the personality of my performance and writing in my online presence.

5) Increase social media followers.

As a designer, do they sound clear enough for you?

 I should really know better. I've brought great shame to my ancestors on this day.  









 That is what I took it to mean. 




 A friend shared it on facebook...

Dammit. 




 When I do a google image search for logotype I get mostly typed based logos. If I search for logos, I get more pictorial examples.

Clearly it's a common, if not universal, usage. 




 I have not watched the video or read any comments but I have a very LOUD opinion that I have not thought through and some statistics I remember seeing somewhere.

Am I in the right place? 




 As an Australian, I don't quite understand. Can cable companies tie up an entire market like that? Isn't that anti-competitive?  




 Is there a difference between the two? 

EDIT: Thanks - a designer suggested it would be cheaper if I only wanted a logotype rather than a logo. That makes sense now.

 Everyone is asking that. Everyone.

Even Colbert is.

 "New film Old Fashioned is 50 Shades of Grey for Christians, claims its creator"

http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/new-film-old-fashioned-is-50-shades-of-grey-for-christians-claims-its-creator-9636401.html 









 I love each and every one of those movies deeply.  




 Great film! Very true to the original story and an absolute mindfuck. 

The low budget is obvious on occasion but that's a quibble. 




 It's fairly common behaviour among Australian politicians.  




 No, but with metcard, you could buy a ticket on the tram AND were left with a physical record of the purchase. 

Under that system, buying a ticket was simple and easy. 

 




 If they provided a system that allowed people to buy tickets near or on public transport like we had for years before Myki came along, that might be possible. 




 That's right! I'll just walk over to the ticket machine here on the tram...oh it's gone. That's OK, I'll just get one at the next stop...not there either. 

If someone lives nowhere near a 7/11 or a train station, they can not use public transport. 

And even if you carry a fully topped up card with you at all times, the machines STILL will often not scan properly and, unless you go to extraordinary measures, you have no way to prove it.

http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/court-in-the-act--how-commuters-are-defeating-myki-fines-20140930-10nz6z.html


 




 I'd have no problem with ticket inspectors handing out fines to fare evaders if they still had a system that made it, you know, possible to buy a fare.

I live near a large hotel, on a train line, that is three kilometres from the nearest 7/11. At least once a week, without fail, I see tourists standing at the tram stop looking worried. 

I'll often ask if they are OK and they ask where they can buy a ticket. I sigh and being to explain....


 




 why does the bride need advice but not the groom? 




 That's where the video is posted. You want to see the content, you've got to go to the site. I'm not going to hold your hand.

Why don't you go see if Ello has it? 




 This must have been shared here before now but I can see any references to it. 

 









 urgh 




 I walk alot at the moment.  I really need to do sprints and interval training 




 It took me a long time to find meds that worked so I'd rather not. 




 I've been using My Fitness pal for the last couple of months. 




 Great idea 




 I'm back on medication for anxiety and a tic disorder (20 mg Citalopram and valium as needed)

It's great for my mental health but shocking for weight. I crave sugar all the time and my metaloblism has slowed right down. 

I put on 2 kilos in a fortnight (about five pounds) and so I started dieting but I just can't shift the weight. I also have a one year old daughter I look after most of the time which makes exercise hard (but not impossible)

Any hints or tips? 




 Is there a full video? 

 




 When I was 15, I got told that I didn't need to be in the top science class as I 'wasn't likely to pursue a career in science' due to 'all the theatre and performing I did'

Today, I perform for hundreds of high school students every week in a show I created called The Bad Science Show that teachers kids about critical thinking and the importance of thinking scientifically outside he classroom.

 From what I can tell by reading those articles. Women make roughly 7% lower for the same job. The other 16% makes about for the fact women work less hours, don't get promoted and working in lower paying fields.

 150 years of fighting for equal rights for men and women is definitely summed up by a moron on reddit posting a screenshot of two idiots have an argument about an ugly shirt.  




 I just finished the second half and it certainly picked up. I got lost in the long speeches about hope between Charles and Logan. 

 




 I'm asking whether anyone else found the movie dull. 
 




 I've sat down to watch this the last three nights and keep falling asleep.

Is it really boring or am I just exhausted?

EDIT: Wow! Do people really love this movie? Have a hit a nerve? 

 




 I can see two mistakes you've made there. 









 In 2005, George W. Bush told the world that God told him to "go and end the tyranny in Iraq."

I'd argue that would count as pretty radical christianity.

 This is brilliant.

You need to take a screen shot of this, print it out and put it in a time capsule so that, years from now when you're an adult, you can pull it out and shake your head. 




 I dig those goggles. 




 Enough. Just, enough.

You get one chance to release a film, maybe two if the producers completely ruin the original work ala The Wicker Man.

A film's plot should be solid and inevitable, and this endless fiddling and re-releasing does nothing but water down what came before.

  




 I'm looking for someone to redesign www.conman.com.au

The basic page structure will remain the same but I'd like a better, hipper, retro design.

1) a quote 
2) examples of your most hipstery work. 

Thanks.



 




 You fight like a dairy farmer.

 I don't understand this one. Can someone explain it to me?

 




 Which you take a photo of and share back on reddit.

And thus, the circle of life continues. 




 I wear a hat hat all the time, inside and out

 Thanks, I've listed it above. 




 I hate wearing suits, love hats. 

This is what I'm working with at the moment when I need to dress up.

What am I doing right? Wrong?

 Nice one. They're good people.

 We redditors don't have money. I mean REAL people, who leave their houses.  




 I'm a bit stumped for places to promote these gigs I'm helping run from 2-6 June. I've hit up all the university groups and done the usual poster runs but I'm sure there are people out there who'd be keen to come along.

I'm used to having SOME budget to plug these events. Any ideas?

The event info is here: https://www.facebook.com/events/305932406277841/ 




 There is a difference between the two groups but the venn diagram overlaps more than a little. 




 That's some dodgy math. 

There are 30,000 racehorses in Australia. [source: Australian Racing Handbook]

That means a horse has 1 in 240 chance of being killed during a race.

These doesn't include all the other terrible ways a horse can die in this industry.

 




 It's wonderful. Introduces a cast of annoying hipsters and then makes 'em suffer. 




 It is a sad state of affairs when I book as stupid as this one ends up on the top of TIL 




 I binged first season last month and it was great. But it took a nose dive in the second. When does it become good again? 




 Congratulations!  




 Good point.  




 I've never understood hipster bashing. 

They're just living their lives doing what makes them happy, hurting no one. Who am I to tell them they can't explore all of life's opportunities and wonders just because some stranger thinks they're trying too hard or that they are too pretentious.

All that said, put some fucking shoes on.

EDIT: I think many of you missed the key issue. Tolerance or not, that man needs to put some goddamn shoes on. He's in a cafe for pete's sake.  




 Isn't it his niece in the comic? 




 I don't think reddit has too many people in the target demo for this one. 




 Um, The Governor lost his eye after he attacked Michonne because she killed his daughter. 

So there is really no way a one eyed Governor AND his daughter could be in the same place at the same time.

Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.

 The boat builder rows over to the island and is in a passionate embrace with his lover when they are attack by a wild man.

He escapes but the woman is killed. The wildman chases him out to sea, carrying the body of the woman.
