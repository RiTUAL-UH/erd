 I love black gesso, but I can't seem to find a white gesso that doesn't turn out crappy. The black is always so much smoother and gel-like, whereas white is gritty and grainy. 

Have you had this issue? If not, what brand do you use? 




 You could take a marker or something and put a dot or highlight the number or something of the highest number on the die, that way it'd be easier to find.

Also, if they are each using their own sets, they could keep them arranged from smallest to largest or something. 




 Play a game that uses one die exclusively if you want to make it easy on them. There are plenty of games that use d20s or d6s exclusively (actually, come to think of it, all my top favorite games are that way).

Or you could rotate through games that use only one kind of die to teach them each one. Like Dark Heresy or Wild Talents for d10s, Deadzone for d8s (I don't know any rpgs that use d8s exclusively, but Deadzone is awesome), and then d12s are just the ones that aren't d8s or d10s.  




 He said *unit* of small based models, so probably means more than one small based model in base-to-base contact getting between them. 




 I think people are just unaware of other options. 




 Damn, it's been so long I completely forgot about the best part of D20... free online copies of the rules.

And I say that as someone who bought pretty much all the books. 




 I've done stuff like this. It can go well, but don't count on it. I've had it blow up in my face 3 times, and work amazingly 1 time.

That one time though... 




 If you like D20 Modern, D20 Future is a good supplement for it. 

GURPS probably has something that covers the stuff you are looking for too.

 Single models? I think we're all looking for those, buddy. 




 I've been adapting Savage Worlds (at least I think it's SW) playing cards for initiative for other games. I love that it basically lets the players keep track of their own initiative, and the initiative can change every round without taking forever re-order everything. 

It definitely doesn't work for everything (yet, I'm determined to find a way to make it work), at least not without some tweaking, but I defintely like it. 

For my IKRPG game, the cards from the [GM kit](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/accessories/iron-kingdoms-full-metal-fantasy-game-master-toolkit) work nicely. They are just laminated cards that have spots for names and basic combat stats (or ongoing effects) that can be arranged in a pile, and just draw through them. 




 I'm seconding the recommendation for Numenera. Numenera has all the requirements: decent set of magic, good bit of future tech (without a focus on space travel), relatively simple.

And as for whether or not it's adaptable, it's only about the most adaptable system in existence. Creating opponents is super easy too. 

If I knew more about your setting, I could give you a more specific recommendation between Numenera or The Strange (same base system, but different setting, almost 100% compatible though).  




 Are you talking about BESM? If so, then I agree with you. It can run this kind of thing beautifully, and I even liked the d20 version (which is what I think you might mean when you say 'D D anime'... maybe), even though I'm not usually interested in d20 games. The non-d20 version is the "tri-stat" system and is pretty simple as far as core rules go. Both have so many customization options that they can be pretty complicated though. 




 For 5e, there's nothing inherently wrong with it, it's just that it's designed with pseudo-medieval combat in mind, and so will possibly feel a little clunky compared to something designed for modern play. 

The trick to using a map with Fate, is use a map, but not a grid. I use minis, and draw stuff out, and people move themselves around, but there is no grid. I borrow Numenera's range estimates when I need to decide if something is reasonably in range (immediate range is anything within 10'[2"], short range is between that and 30'[6"], and long is anything beyond that up to 100'[20"]), but usually it's pretty obvious what you can and can't do by looking at it. If there is an aspect on some area of the map, I just write it right on the map. 




 If you used a cyanoacrylate based glue (super glue), you can used acetone (nail polish) to get it loose. 




 Well, if they are wargamers, it doesn't hurt to stick with stuff they're at least a little familiar with. There is WH40k Roleplay, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (I recommend 2e if you can find it), and my personal favorite, [Iron Kingdoms RPG](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) (based in the same world as Warmachine/Hordes). 

If you are looking for more rules light games (games from wargames tend to be rules heavy), my top recommendations would be Numenera/The Strange, or Fate (though don't just play Fate Core, pick a setting book and use that).

They are both easy to learn, and easy to run. The [Fate](http://fate-srd.com/) rules are free to check out. You can get a digital copy of [Numenera](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/114852/Numenera-Players-Guide) or [The Strange Player's Guide](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129406/The-Strange-Players-Guide?term=the+strange) for about $8 (or a physical copy for about $15), which isn't bad to check it out. 

edit: Also going with the basics isn't a bad idea either right now, Dungeons and Dragons 5e is really newbie friendly, and they have [basic rules](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules) you can check out for free. 




 D D5e is designed with the option of not using a map in mind, and it does alright. Not the best in that category though.

Numenera/The Strange is a great system that doesn't need a map. They have just 3 ranges (immediate, short, and long), and it's pretty easy to approximate without having a map and still have pretty tactical combat. It's very open to creative ideas during combat.

Fate is also great for not using a map. It uses zones, and they are a decent way to illustrate where people are without using a map. This is at the far end of the theater-of-the-mind style play, and it actually borders on being harder to use with a map than without. 




 On-rails isn't bad if it's what the players prefer. I had a player freak out and rage-quit because I *wasn't* railroading the group. Different strokes, I guess.

You are right that D D5e might work for you. Combat can be light-ish, and it's not too hard to convert it for what you are talking about (though people will say the result isn't very good, but w/e).

If you don't like crunchy, Fate might be another good option for you. They actual have a Dresden Files supplement you could look at, might be 100% what you are looking for. Fate doesn't always use a map, but there's nothing stopping you. I *always* use a map at least some of the time when I'm running Fate, so it's really just up to you. 




 I highly recommend you check out [Stars Without Number](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition). It is a scifi retro-clone of D D. There is a supplement called [Polychrome](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/91490/Polychrome-Cyberpunk-Adventure-for-Stars-Without-Number) that adds a lot of the Shadowrun feel, and you can just ignore the starship stuff.

The core book is free, and the Polychrome supplement is dirt cheap. 




 [D D combat is boring as shit in comparison.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/396mrn/system_advice/cs0su0c) 




 Yeah, Cephalyx is really even more limited than they are. Until this brand new book they've had only one warnoun, whereas both the Minion contracts have several.

I wouldn't even care if the lists were terrible as long as they keep with this ~50% off retail pricing.

Hell, I have enormous amounts of pirates and dwarves, and if they do more Merc contracts I'm probably going to buy them anyway. 




 Neocron is probably not worth bothering with. It was terrible back in the day, and probably not any better after all these years. The offline demo was better than the actual game, which is bizarre.

Impostor is really good though, I definitely recommend it. 




 With CoC and now Cephalyx, that's 7 AiOs for Warmachine, and only 4 for hordes. I'm hoping that means they are going to do AiOs for both minions contracts. Though I'm not going to hold my breath. 




 If they go through and do other mercs/minions contracts, I'm going to be a very happy, very broke man. 




 I pre-ordered 4 of the other all-in-ones before they were on the release schedule. 




 I'm working on my homebrew gritty near-future scifi game. It's not next on my list because it needs a certain kind of group, because it's pretty serious (not all of my friends like serious games). 

The focus is how there are large "utopian" cities, but they exist at the cost of the lives of people who aren't allowed in (and the freedoms of those who are).

Inspirational movies/games list: Impostor, Babylon A.D., Minority Report, I Robot, The Island, Johnny Mnemonic, Dredd, Lockdown, Appleseed, Ghost in the Shell, Deus Ex, Neocron. 




 Oh you.... 




 I didn't really specify, but I could see it both ways. 




 The game is unrelated to the D video game series.

and now I'm sad. 




 God. Damn. Cryx. 




 If he's playing a tinkerer, couldn't *he* be the one who specially worked on his crossbow? Even if he doesn't really focus on crafting that kind of thing, it can sort of be a "special side project" he's been working on, and what it lacks in expertise, it makes up for in ingenuity. 

That's if the only problem you have is how, in your setting, he'd have one, which is what it sounds like. Power-wise, like you said, there are guns, which are superior in almost every way except stealthiness.

Not to take sides, but one: I rarely tell my players no, and two: I wanted to do this *exact* thing before, and even was specially trained in crafting crossbows, and my GM said no. He was a jerk though, so don't be like him (funniest thing, he was actually a crossbowman in one of those "not-larp" medieval thingies, yet he always made sure crossbows sucked in his games) . 




 Some of them. Though they do have "graphic" or "comic" versions that are mostly pretty pictures. The word ones are the best ones though. 




 You sound like how I was about five years ago, and I have a friend who is the same way. You are definitely a minority, but you aren't alone. One of the things that helped me get back into gaming was working on a hyper-realistic gritty-as-fuck game with my friend, and after that I was ready to play a bit of the mindless stuff again. You just need to find a couple people who you can do that sort of thing with, and then you won't be quite so hard for it all the time. 




 I'm a big fan of Wild Talents, but I've been playing it since the Godlike days, so I'm probably basing a little of it on nostalgia. 

For another rules-intensive game Mutants and Masterminds is pretty good. It's based on D20 stuff, but doesn't have some of the bad parts. Combats are still on the longish side though.

I think the Cypher system (Numenera/The Strange) would work really well for a supers game, but I think it works well for almost anything. 

I'll also second Fate for a narrative focused supers game. 




 Books. I think they're called "books".  




 If you do a google image search for Iron Kingdoms, you can get a pretty good idea.

They went the route of magic working with technology instead of being antithetical to it, and they have things like Gun Mages.

It's one of the better rules-heavy systems out there, as they manage to keep combats from being long drawn out boring things. 




 Have you heard about [Iron Kingdoms](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf)? 




 Not helpful (sorry man, there just isn't anything out there yet), but I would really like to see Deadzone done as an RPG ruleset. 

Maybe check out WH40k roleplay?

Or if you only need it to be a little different from high fantasy, Iron Kingdoms is amazing. It basically plays like Steampunk XCOM. 

As much as I dislike D D4e, their version of Gamma World wasn't horrible.  




 2d20 pick best is almost exactly the same as 1d20+5

example of how people don't generally understand probability

Well, that's true, just not how you meant it. 

I get it. Math is hard, bro. Just keep doin you, though, cause it's great.

 You clearly take this shit way to seriously. It's not real. 

But.... since you want to go there...........


Who decided that rule? Oh, that's right, the Sith. There is exactly 0 way of knowing how many of them actually decided to follow this rule. Especially since "Sith" roughly translates to "People who don't give two shits about rules" (translated from Bajoran, of course, the Sith's native language).

Also, should you actually watch the movie, they specifically say it's not cannon (though it could be, since hey, Disney). And since the Empire was defeated by a platypus, "lots of Darths" doesn't seem like the biggest issue.

But hey, good for you for knowing what was said in Episode One, the best Star Wars movie ever made.
