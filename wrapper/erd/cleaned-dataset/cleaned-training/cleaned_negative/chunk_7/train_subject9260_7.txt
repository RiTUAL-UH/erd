 I... don't remember what my GPA was.

I did reasonably well, but failed a couple of classes from not caring. Still graduated on time. 




 Thanks for the feedback. The hobby beads caught my eye, but I wouldn't want to spend too much money on a less profitable system. 




 That is included in those prices.

I did a test pattern using a picture I had lying around, the order would have cost $17.95, including shipping, so I'd have to charge at least $20 to make it worth it.

A $15 price point would only be viable if I plan and order for batches of products (occasionally, I wouldn't have to buy new beads because I'd have some left over from other projects).

Basically, would you be willing to pay more for the higher quality images available from PH? 




 At this point, if the game doesn't include a way for players to make real money by playing, reward the best players with Lamborghinis, and physically reach out of the computer to give you a blow job, then I don't think it can ever live up to the hype. 




 It reminds me a little of the Buffy theme (which was awesome) 




 Hell, there are people who never played HL2 making HL3 jokes... why? Because we're all sure it isn't coming. 




 That's He3. 




 First rule of Half-Life 3.

You do not talk about Half-Life 3. 




 Honestly... a guy having sex with children angers me.

A guy jerking off while he rubs himself with piss and noms on shit makes me want to puke... and then I fear that would turn him on more.

Being angry that some illegal things are called fetishes is like being angry that Mormonism is called a religion. 




 I have experience with the RPG Maker system, but no finished projects... I think I get bored too easily. 




 A fetish simply means a sexual proclivity towards something. 

BDSM is a domination fetish. Bestiality is an animal fetish. Pedophilia is a child fetish.

Out of those, two are illegal. And there are more fetishes out there. There are foot fetishists, and people who are only turned on by cellulite... plush fetishes, exhibition, voyeurism, even people turned on by poop.

Fetishes are a many - varied thing, but some of them are legal, and some aren't  (nor should they be) 




 In many countries, dog meat is incredibly frowned upon. To the point where eating pets is basically a racial joke. 




 Well, we know she did it for 2-3 years... 




 Por que no los dos?

Fetishes don't necessarily imply legality. 




 Doesn't even need to be multiple dogs.

Scenario - Teenage girl, alone in the house with dog. Dog decides to hump her leg, because he's a dog. Girl gets idea, realizes that daddy won't be home until later... ???... profit! 




 2D girlfriends are the best. 




 Yeah, when your choices are cousins fucking and the cumbox, you don't really find two people having a sexual relationship disgusting. 




 How do people even remember stuff like that? 




 Don't worry too much, it was a throwaway line from the very beginning of the series. A funny line, but not one designed to be memorable, and certainly not intended to be used to make a rule on an internet forum over a decade later. 




 We should only post Owls on Sunday. 




 I wonder how many of the tattoos are fake. 




 Pros - More colors, no ironing/misfiring, higher definition

Cons - Higher cost per bead (assuming larger purchasing amounts, $0.35/135 beads vs. $2/1000), boards are not reusable, pattern sizes are less flexible.

Because I have unsteady hands, I find it troublesome to iron pieces, making PH very attractive, but I fear that the higher cost is a turn-off to buyers. What do you think is more appropriate/appealing?

[Example of Pixel Hobby](http://kasiulai.lt/images/801001.png) - 1 panel + 2000 beads for about $15-20 (including time). Approx 4"x5"

[Example of Perler Beads](http://img13.deviantart.net/968a/i/2013/208/d/3/nyan_cat_perler_bead_by_kittyespeon-d6ffzp3.jpg) ~700 beads, $5-10 (including time). Approx 2.5"x 8"

If I switch systems, I'll be happy to sell off my existing Perler stock (for a good rate). 




 I like Rachel out of the three that loaded. She's a leading lady, so there has to be some attractiveness about her. 




 Superman still looks exactly like Christopher Reeve... But if they were going for "every actor who played the role", they forgot to add in George Reeves. 




 Weren't there a lot of people that paid well for it? 




 The reason why they do this is because they get far more from concerts, including the merchandising, than they do from piddly little CD sales. 




 Oh yeah. That's hot. 




 He's got some 'splaining to do. 




 The guy above this one publicly stated that his products were utter chap, and lost his jewelry company 500,000,000 Pounds overnight. 




  I'm sure they would've had no problems swapping.

*Maybe* they would have been okay swapping.

If there are entitled losers, and not people with a legitimate issue, then they'd be pissed off for your asking. 




 That's clearly a "bored now" face. 




 It has to, it has change in the name. 




 Technically, they are. While some consider them a new overall religion, as opposed to a branch of Christianity, their core belief is in the divinity of Jesus, the son of God.

But, if it makes you feel any better, you can replace it in the example with Catholic, Baptist, Methodist, or whichever you prefer. 




 Invisible sky god who imposes morality on humans that he, himself, doesn't follow generally seems made up to me.

But, I will say this. It is nigh impossible to proof a negative. It falls on the positive claim to prove they are truth. For example, if I told you I flew to the store today, would you believe me without my proof? Should you be forced to give proof that I never left the ground?

Therefore, you are challenged to prove the truth of the Quran, that it is more than simply a book. 




 Okay, so you're sorry.

Are you resigning yet? 




 No. According to the Quran, "There is no God but Allah, and Mohammad is his messenger."

Mohammad is simply a prophet, like Jesus and Elijah. It makes perfect sense for him to not write about himself much.

They worship Allah, they venerate Mohammad. 




 To put it simply, they believe in the historicity of Jesus, not the divinity of Jesus, making them technically an offshoot of Judaism (which also admits that Jesus was probably a real person) 




 Well, of course it's made up, but if he *actually was* a humble messenger of god (big if, there), then he would be more interested in writing about his predecessors than himself. 




 Giggity. 




 I know a way to settle that one... Does anyone know a Mormon we could ask, and see if *they* call themselves Christian?

Edit: A quick search reveals this...

Gordon B. Hinckley, prior President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1995-2008), said:

We are Christians in a very real sense and that is coming to be more and more widely recognized. Once upon a time people everywhere said we are not Christians. They have come to recognize that we are, and that we have a very vital and dynamic religion based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. We, of course, accept Jesus Christ as our Leader, our King, our Savior...the dominant figure in the history of the world, the only perfect Man who ever walked the earth, the living Son of the living God. He is our Savior and our Redeemer through whose atoning sacrifice has come the opportunity of eternal life. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints pray and worship in the name of Jesus Christ. He is the center of our faith and the head of our Church. The Book of Mormon is Another Testament of Jesus Christ and witnesses of His divinity, His life, and His Atonement. 




 It definitely seems like they are trying to confuse the hell out of us on that aspect. 




 The virus was attacking the infrastructure before the T-X appeared.

Skynet created the virus during a time when it was only being put online for learning, and used it as a way to wreak havoc on human computing systems and force them to put the mainframe online.

At least, that's the wiki's explanation for what happened.

Time travel is so fucked up... But it wasn't the T-X's doing, for sure. 




 I will neither confirm nor deny this. 




 It's still an ignorant thing to say. 




 Yeah, she was so mad that she didn't spell my name right when it was looking her in the face. 




 They are still considered Christian, because they still believe in Jesus. They just think he did more after he left Israel. 




 I'm starting to think I'm not cut out for this game. 




 It's just an asterisk, I don't see anything. Even with the error analysis tool used to analyze the first image. 




 So, where does "koala" fit in? 




 [](/colgatenoidea) I'm starting to think I've been lied to all my life, and I'm actually an idiot... 




 Can I get an explanation for this? Because I don't even understand this. 




 No, we apparently don't.

I mean, your hints were "the Steg's back" (meaning that he has returned, not to look at the back of the dinosaur) and "the method is hidden in the picture" which is a pretty bad "major hint" because we could have guessed the method was somewhere in the picture.

I get that I'm new here, and still haven't really gotten into this yet, but... we didn't even know you were looking for text until you told us. 




 Left Right Right Left Down Right Down? 




 I'm assuming you mean 22 scales on his back. 




 Is that second hint blank? 




 -22/35? 




 -13? 




 Dumbledore is killed by Snape, Rosebud was his sled, Norman Bates was his mother, Cloud wasn't really in SOLDIER, Bruce Willis was dead all along, and Taylor was on Earth the whole time. 




 It was the first one of those I saw, so there you go...

I only gave it the first time. 




 That abysmal team defeated their other opponents handily, including soccer powerhouses in Australia and England.

They earned the spot, but they simply are fighting uphill for the Americans. 




 That was in terrible taste... take an upvote. 




 GOALLLLLLLL x2! 




 A broken clock is right twice a day. 









 It was an early start, and a proof-of-concept 




 An important distinction...

Sending someone to prison, the guards are *supposed* to be keeping the prisoners safe from each other. Largely, they have failed in that, but the reform should be to fix the prison system (primarily by fixing the problem of sending too many people into prison), and not by trying to claim that prison is cruel punishment. 




 But it would still be cruel, and thus against the constitution.

It would have to be fought in the courts, but it would certainly be ruled in violation, because it is needlessly and maliciously violent. 




 Number 57 will blow your mind! 




  Usual things do not shock the sensibilities of a normal person.

That's right, so what happens if the average person thinks that disemboweling is appropriate for child rapists?

Does that mean we should equip prisons with gutting stations? No, because such punishment is needlessly cruel, even if the average person is okay with it. 




 Yeah, I caught it after the refresh.  




 Okay... some of these are just blowing my mind, and I thought I was smart...

I don't see a question to be answered. 




 Wrong.

Cruelty, as stated before, requires a malicious intent. So a punishment that might shock the sensibilities of a normal man, but was created unintentionally is unusual, but not cruel.

Most of the time, such infractions are both cruel and unusual, but the amendment covers both.

You would not want it to be otherwise, if the sensibilities of the nation were to change to be okay with torturing prisoners again. 




 The confusion you are having is not with *my* language, but the language of the Amendment... "cruel and unusual punishment"

While it can be construed as only applying to such acts that are both cruel and unusual, it was obviously intended by the founders to prohibit either and both at once.

Thus, we have to legally define cruelty as well as unusuality in regard to punishment.

Since cruelty is primarily concerned with malicious intent, and incarceration is primarily concerned with protecting the innocent from the guilty, there is no cruelty simply borne from incarceration.

As for unusual punishment, incarceration generally does not shock the sensibilities of people, as it is reasonable to remove such persons from society. Plus, incarceration can be reversed and remedied, something that can not be done with death, dismemberment, or torture. 




 Blame it on the English language. 




 Okay, let's go with the italicized definition, instead of the more appropriate explanation.

 cruelty - The deliberate and malicious infliction of mental or physical pain upon persons or animals.

The same portion of "cruel and unusual punishment" *was* the part that I copied before. Nice try.

For "cruelty" to apply to judicial punishment, there needs to be deliberate harm and malicious intent.

For that definition, and is exclusive. English is funny that way.

If you cut off my leg with a hacksaw, for no reason but because you hate me, that demonstrates malice (evil intent) and deliberate action. It is assumed that if you have malicious intent, then you are deliberately acting.

However, if you cut off my leg with a hacksaw because we are climbing in the Alps and my leg is hopelessly pinned, then there is no malicious intent... it was a medical necessity.

Going back to the issue of incarceration of criminals, there is deliberate harm in locking a person up for longer than his child is in school, but there is no malicious intent. He is locked up because he needed to be separated from society.  




 No. Technically I am saying that both guns and drugs are illegal in a school zone. 




 Is the poem in klingon? 




 It depends on the bank. But for a scammer, it is better to be safe than sorry. 




 I can tell that it isn't about the man. The image is edited from a stock photo used on a women's blog.

The poem is unreadable, though, using the limited editing functions on my phone.

I've been able to get the lettering of the poem visible, but it is too mangled to make out more than a few letters, and it seems that it is encoded to boot. (I see capital letters in the middle and end of words.) 




 He can still overdraw your account, putting you on the hook for a charge and an overdraft fee. 




 You see, when the show was canceled for the 15th time, Nibbler interfered with the development of Netflix's Futurama development so the seasons would show differently. In so doing, he created millions of Fabled Ones, who lack the Delta Brain Wave.

He called them, "Television Viewers" 




 Oddly enough, if you hyperoxygenate water, like they did in Abyss, it may be possible to breath it like air, though maybe not. The problem is keeping the fluid oxygenated properly, and the fact that lungs might not work at efficiency with a liquid.

Most certainly, it would not be of great advantage to develop,  as opposed to creating better air-breathing apparatuses.  




 In terms of actual practicality? Only for *extremely* fine adjustments to a satellite dish, probably.

Ultimately, there will be no real use for it. It's just to see how small he could make it. 




  What law are you quoting?

I wasn't quoting a particular law. I was stating a fact. You can not bring guns. You can not bring drugs. You can not bring guns and drugs.

The fact is **and** does not always mean *both*, it also means *either or both*, depending on context 




 Okay, first off to ensure that you are not conflating the definitions...

 **cruelty** - As applied to people, cruelty encompasses abusive, outrageous, and inhumane treatment that results in the wanton and unnecessary infliction of suffering upon the body or mind.

By this definition, locking a criminal away (a necessary action) is *not* legal cruelty.

The more appropriate definition...

 **cruel and unusual punishment** - Such punishment as would amount to torture or barbarity, any cruel and degrading punishment not known to the Common Law, **or** any fine, penalty, confinement, or treatment that is so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of the community.

As you can see here, locking a criminal away for a reasonable length of time is not prohibited, because it is neither cruel (it is not torturous to remove a criminal from society), and it is not unusual if the length of time is reasonable. 




 It's a pretty common turn of phrase.

It means to be pierced, usually through the torso, by a bladed instrument, in such a manner that the blade has run all the way through the body. 




 Okay, what I see is a drawing of an extremely dysfunctional couple, holding knives on each other.

The woman holds the knife demurely, the man holds the knife with strength.

In both cases, if they pull away unexpectedly, they will die.

On one hand, it is a misguided sign of trust, they do not think that the other will harm them, and so they do not push away the other knife.

On the other hand, it is a sign of control. Each of them goes behind the back of the other and prevents them from leaving.

The one thing not present in this composition is "true love". 




 Smoking weed in a small room with children? I'd have called child welfare. 




 That's "What, What, In The Butt", sir. 




 If they are willing to fuck over the people that willingly worked their website for free, what do you think they feel about the trogldytes that sit there and mindlessly give others Gold for comments that bash Reddit? 




 Because we have sooooo much respect for Ellen Pao. 




 You mean the same documentary that was shown on HBO? 




 Okay, let me try to put it this way.

You are prohibited from bringing drugs and firearms onto a schoolyard.

Does that mean that one can bring drugs, as long as they don't have a handgun? Or that they can bring a gun, as long as they don't have crack? No.

They are prohibited from bringing both or either. 




 Is it cruel to do that to a man who stole money from a charity, or killed a man, or kidnapped a child for sexual intent?

I'd say it wouldn't be. 




 I would classify pot as habit forming, and not addictive.

Yes, you can generally quit any time you want without going through painful withdrawal, but there is still an aspect of pot use that makes it hard for people to walk away from.

Maybe the withdrawal is simply different from what most people consider for drug use, but there are people who are addicted to the way pot makes them feel, and don't want to give up that feeling. 




 In legal larleyence, "cruel" means that your punishment is unnecessarily harsh.

A life sentence for a small amount of pot is cruel. A life sentence for orchestrating a dozen murders is not.

It can be considered cruel to the average person to keep someone separated from society, but legal cruelty was envisioned as unnecessarily harsh punishment. 




 That was the way the founding fathers envisioned that protection.

The Rack? Cruel and Unusual. Medieval torture devices are completely out of favor.

Life imprisonment for 3 Oz of weed? Cruel. The punishment should fit the crime, and having an unnecessarily long sentence is just there to make a harsh punishment.

Sentencing a rapist to have his feet licked by puppies for 3 months? Unusual. While it isn't cruel (to the criminal, it's a little cruel to the puppies), it is very unusual, and thus is unconstitutional.   




 The signed cards are incredibly rare. For the theme decks, I don't know the ratio (I could crack open a case of KLK decks and see if I got a signed card, but I think it's less chance than 1:18)

In general, the signed cards will go $40-80 in the right circles, some unpopular ones will be $10-20, and some older cards will be more. 




 And here's Cap punching Hitler a lot.

 It sounds low for sure, but as a 5'11" guy, I simply remember the taller people more than the shorter.

Though, I will state that the 14% figure might include women, who are statistically shorter than men.

The sad part is, for that girl that said she would *never* sleep with [a guy under 6'...](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/19/26C8D86100000578-3001454-image-a-7_1426724405058.jpg) 




 I think he is referencing the idea of young men masturbating as "gross". 




 I think that until we find actual silicon or ammonia based life, we can't discount the possibility that such non-carbon life doesn't exist. 




 Because they are trained monkeys who think of Reddit Gold as a massive upvote, and not as a revenue builder for Reddit. 




 I'll never forgive Ward for that. 




 Where is he going to find Sarah Jessica Parker at this time if night? 




 Comedy central has been really shitty about commercials lately, compressing shows so they don't follow the 30 minute format.

They do this so they can add more commercials, increasing revenue, while showing less actual shows, decreasing cost.

I can see them cutting "inconsequential" lines as part of that. 




 Many people accidentally create a ponzi scheme without realizing it. They don't realize that their system relies solely on new investors, and can not survive if they promise higher returns without them.

At least with the changes I outlined, they can avoid that trap, by segregating the investors from the projects. 




 Simple. Unless you have to, don't say you are a soldier. 




 Well, assuming F Society is real, then they named themselves after the building. Perhaps they (stupidly) feel that no one would be able to track them down using that clue.

But you are correct that it is more likely that the whole group is in his head. 




 I'll take "Shitty Internet Decisions" for $500, Alex. 




 Clearly. I don't like to levy such an accusation  (who am I kidding, I do), but without appropriate changes to the platform, this system has Pyramid written all over it.

Now, what can be done is to limit the campaigns to a window of time, and all donations to the system get split among active programs.

Have the length of time be 1 day, plus 1 day for an uploaded video, plus 1 day for promised stretch goals. Up to 3 days at a time.

The system has 99 slots (so each project gets 1 cent per dollar, with 1 cent going to the platform), and when one program expires, the next one on the list comes up.

A 1 year timeframe in that scenario can give funding to 12-36,000 projects without expanding. 




 T'pao 




 That would be Backpage 




 It is private, but it is not shut down.

You have to be invited, generally that happens when you are given gold for an intelligent or enciteful comment, instead of just buying it yourself.  




 Very possible. She was a very large snake. 




 I don't want to live on this planet anymore. 




 And I said, YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 




 They could easily create a body tracker that connects using Bluetooth and can be programmed to operate on any part of the body. (Finger, hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, neck, chest, waist, hip, knee, ankle, foot, or toes). The more sensors you have on you, the more accurate the tracking. 




 Voat.co

They are having a little downtime though, because Reddit's drama is flooding them. 




 I have the strange feeling that I'll hit 100k comment karma, and reddit will die before I get my invite to the /r/CenturyClub. 




 /r/reallounge is better than /r/lounge anyway. 




 Half of the ads are "thank you for not using adblock, here is a silly moose" 




 That's what troping is.

Mind you, no one thinks Tropes, like Plot Armor, are a bad thing. It is just a way of identifying story elements. 




 Dude, it's a Trope. Get over it.

Plot Armor is the way you answer questions, such as "How the hell did Indy survive a nuclear blast by hiding in a fridge?" 




 Okay... so, what happens when new people stop coming into Enchain?

At $1.29/$4, it takes 3 or 4 donations to match your own.

By the time the first project is "funded" ($4), 4 people are in queue waiting for $4 each. A total of $16.

It would take an additional 12 donations to match those 4 projects, requiring $48 to fund everyone.

Eventually, you would get to a point where millions of projects are in the queue, unless you include a time limit to submit a project or include an option to fund without reciprocity. 




 The difference between it is when the character is put into dangerous scenarios, and survives *simply* because the plot demands it. Like a small team of 4 people blasting their way through a moon-sized space station with millions of guards shooting at them, and them alone... and the only guy that dies is the one that got into a swordfight with The Dragon.  




 It is a perfect name for a small animal. It is a word meaning something small or petty. 




 It is a term for when a character other than the main character survives a scenario because the author demands him to appear later.

Jo killed off many important minor characters, but she couldn't allow Hagrid to die, because he had to carry Harry's lifeless body at the end of the series.

The opposite of that trope is "Doomed By Canon", where a character has to die because of the story, like Thomas and Martha Wayne. 




 That was not an ordinary snake.

Arthur was in the hospital for weeks because the wounds stayed magically open. They even tried stitches.

Because Nagini was a horcrux, her venom was magically magnified, just like the other horcruxes had their powers amplified.

The Cup and Diadem we never see in action.

The Diary gains an intelligence and talks back to the user.

The Locket holds itself shut unless spoken to in Parseltounge.

The Ring, which contained the Resurrection Stone, brought Death to the wearer.

Nagini caused wounds that do not heal quickly enough to survive (Arthur was kept alive long enough for the venom to work its way out).

Harry's connection to Voldemort was strengthened to a form of ESP. 




 There's nothing dangerous about Blast-Ended Skrewts!
