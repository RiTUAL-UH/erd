 I have. And you know what? Looking at their voting records doesn't make everyone reach the same conclusion. Mostly because people find some issues/votes more important than others. I know that Sanders opposed a 2007 immigration reform bill while Hillary Clinton supported it (just edited this because I accidentally deleted the "supported it" here before I posted this)--and I find that a much more important issue than others; and in this case Hillary Clinton voted much more in line with my own views. 




 They both support improving on the ACA, support a deal with Iran over their nuclear program, support normalizing relations with Cuba, have slammed income inequality, and so on. I support these--as do they. And I did that isidewith thing that people have been posting all over r/politics and the results were identical to the point that the difference was negligible: 95% Sanders and 91% Clinton--a mere four percentage points difference. So, yes I can agree with both and they both seemingly putting out the same thing.
