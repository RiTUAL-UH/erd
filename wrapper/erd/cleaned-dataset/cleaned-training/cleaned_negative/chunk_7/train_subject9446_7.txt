 What's 'selective power'? 




 This in the comments gave me pause for thought:


Power cuts, hospitals in darkness.

Incubators and life support machines without power. Lives stolen young and old.

Pakistan, traveling further back into the dark ages one megawatt at a time.

And they have nuclear weapons... 




 Let's hope this isn't representative of how well they guard their nukes.

  Johnny Rotten 'bassist'

?

 




 Ask me who a Good Briton is and I'd answer... Duke of Portland

Why? 




 6 and out. 




 The word 'great' has its own particular connotations. 

Imagine if it was '100 Goodest Britons' (pardon the grammar). A different vibe and would no doubt produce a different type of list, I think. 




 I think Jamie Oliver could be a celebrity/dark-horse candidate who could make the list if it was done today.

Gordon Brown wouldn't be an undeserving inclusion, IMO either. 




 What with all the hagiography/state funeral etc. after her death I wouldn't be surprised if she placed higher.

Agree that Diana would slide down the poll. Her placing last time was a bit of an anomaly, IMO. 




 The decision made by Morgan Freeman's character at the end of the second one could be taken to be an anti-NSA statement though. 














 Im also very worried about drone proliferation, with other countries acquiring these weapons systems. In 1945, only one country possessed a nuclear weapon, and look at the world now. I think the same thing is going to happen with drone proliferation.

 Vicki Janik's introduction to the book I mentioned in my other comment touches on the some of the concerns I had in relation to fooldom:

 In ancient Greece the fool-parasites charmed the wealthy into offering them dinner invitations with the promise of entertainment and joking. One step from being beggars, they exploited their own pretended or real infirmities for food and money. Welsford describes the existence of such figures in Greek and Roman society. Nearly two thousand years later in the courts of Europe, natural and artificial fools still were supported and often entirely maintained by the wealthy. Many courts, including that of Peter the Great, the early-eighteenth-century czar of Russia, kept great numbers of natural and artificial fools. In order to maintain the size of this group, his court went so far as to arrange marriages and funerals for naturals such as dwarves who were wed in grotesque mock ceremonies. Thus, like the jokes they told, natural fools seemed spontaneously to generate and to be forever maintained agelessly; where they had been and when they had left were either unanswerable questions or irrelevant ones.  

Even very famous fools in society lack clear ties to the real world and seem to be at odds with "normal" existence. Will Sommers was born, according to Robert Armin's verse, "in Shropshire, as some say / Was brought to Greenwich on a holy day, / Presented to the king". His heritage is questionable: meager references to family, like that to an "onckle," may be only fictional, having been recorded by Armin from traditional jokes. Armin also writes that while Sommers dined with the king and Cardinal Wolsey or jested with the king alone, he later "laide him downe among the spaniels to sleepe". Such contradictory, atypical experience is representative of the fool. Modern, real-life fools sometimes live similarly unfocused lives. Douglas Brode contends that Woody Allen's persona has penetrated into his private life and is at odds with the private life he tries to live. Although Allen's experiences have been more acutely painful, they reflect the confusion surrounding the private lives of Groucho and Chico Marx. The necessary peripheral objectivity and isolation of the fool perhaps make the intimately shared life of marriage and family difficult. 

*Fools and Jesters in Literature, Art, and History A Bio-Bibliographical Sourcebook* ed. Viki K. Janik pp.8-9. 




 Thank you very much. I gave those a read. I've also just come across *Fools and Jesters in Literature, Art, and History A Bio-Bibliographical Sourcebook* edited by Vicki K. Janik which looks like it should be a very informative read. I'll give Christopher Moore's *Fool* a look too. 




 I was struck by the thought on reading *King Lear*. That is set in ancient Britain but anything about jesters/court fools from throughout history would be much appreciated. 

Would they have had families? How were they chosen? Are there instances in which they have been portrayed that are particularly accurate/inaccurate? What are the best sources for finding out more? 





























 Another suggestion that I once read (the source I cannot at the moment find) was that the 'binding' had to do with a gathering together of the wisdom of the ancestors. 




 That site is terrible for pop-ups, I grant you. I watched the whole of *Samsara* with a hellacious, heavy metal soundtrack in the background. I thought it was part of the film. It was just the music from an unnoticed pop-up in a different tab.

I hope you manage to see it. Perhaps try again or using a different device if you can. 




 Some say the only difference between samsara and nirvana is attention. 









 Oh I see now. Don't click the green 'play now' button. Just scroll down and press the 'play symbol' button (on the person's forehead).

 I recommend getting into the 'way of tea'. I watched it with some organic Sun Moon Lake red tea with some althaea officinalis, lobelia, boswellia, chamomile, lime blossom, lemon balm, rosemary, nettle, aniseed, lavender, rose petals, and blue malva flowers added. A gorgeous experience. :)

 Cameron has rediscovered his inner husky-hugger, saying that if the Greens arent in the leaders debates then he wont be either. That he never wanted to be in them is by the by. Douglas Carswell, the Ukip MP, thinks broadcasters should copy *Have I Got News for You*, which once replaced Roy Hattersley with a tub of lard, but what could they use? Caviar? A butler? That Bullingdon photo?

*Patrick Kidd, The Times Diary (TMS), January 9 2015*

Readers were asked to send in ideas for what could take David Camerons place if he chickens out of the election debates. An Eton mess, suggested Roy Brown (that could stand for much of the government), while Adrian Brodkin thought Larry, the Downing Street cat, would be a purrfect substitute. Angela Tammas nominated a stick of candy floss, but there seems to be little similarity. One is a sickly creation of sugar-coated spin and hot air, while the other is a pink fairground treat.

  Sunday Times analysis showed that despite the Tories increasing the number of female candidates  to 36%, against 24% in 2010  few have any chance of becoming an MP.
 
One third of winnable seats  those lost by less than 10% at the last election  are being contested by Tory women. This contrasts with Labour where all-women shortlists have been used to shoehorn female candidates into seats from which they can realistically reach Westminster.
 
Labour women are set to contest three in five of the partys winnable seats and 10 out of 11 safe seats  classed as those won by more than 10% in 2010. Just under half of female Labour candidates have been chosen from all-women shortlists and 65% of those in winnable seats are the products of such lists.

 Thank you very much. That makes a lot of sense. Yes it was chewy and meat-like. I had a hunch they were made of wheat gluten - that's why I was keen to try making it myself because I had bought a pack of vital wheat gluten when making a recipe calling for seitan. I was just perplexed that the only results I got when searching 'Jai Yun' was for a restaurant in San Francisco. 

What would you say are the main difficulties in trying to cook it oneself?

 **A Christmas Dickens**

*Marley was dead to begin with, there's no doubt about that*

 and thus Charles Dickens' slim little Christmas book gets under way and Scrooge's remarkable journey of reclamation begins. *A Christmas Carol* is a wonderful read, full of amazing parallels that hopefully makes us occasionally re-examine our own existence and how we behave towards to one another.

Just over a hundred and sixty years ago in 1853, Charles Dickens strode at haste across the stage of Birmingham's Town Hall to give the first ever public reading of A Christmas Carol; one of many he was to give that season to benefit the New Midland Institute. Being a great supporter of the working man, Dickens agreed to this reading on condition that seat prices were reduced in order to suit the pocket of the working classes of the town, many of whom were glimpsing their hero for the first time. Here the city's newspaper describes the setting. 

*And thus the day passed and nightfall came on, more bitter and freezing than ever; the bleak wind whistling through the streets most dolefully. It was just such a night that Mr Dickens came to read his Christmas Carol to a small family circle of some 2,000 people in our vast Town Hall. What a grand, fine looking party it was. The lights were so brilliant and the drawing room so gay, and the holly so tastefully wreathed that there could be no mistake about this being Christmas. Then the host himself arrived and took his place in his big armchair and told us that we may laugh and cry as much as we wanted, as he liked nothing better than a lot of sympathy.*

I think we can safely assume that by the beginning of the 1850's, Charles Dickens was most certainly England's first 'superstar.' His fame as a writer was thundering rapidly across Europe and the United States. And his ever changing appearance was becoming known to millions through paintings, engravings and photographs which would appear almost weekly in a variety of periodicals, though many would never have encountered him in the flesh. Certainly very few of the 2000 eager faces who rose to cheer him that evening in 1853. What they would have seen was a gentleman of average build sporting a Frank Zappa moustache (the beard was to arrive later) and a mop of dark tousled hair brushed fiercely almost tempestuously forward. He was expensively attired in full evening dress, with diamond studs glittering in his shirt, a bright red buttonhole, a purple waistcoat and a simple watch-chain. He looked quite spectacular. While the applause continued to build, Dickens glanced fleetingly at the huge assembly of people, took a quick sip of water, and then with theatrical elegance raised a hand for silence. As the applause faded so grew a sense of excitement as everyone leant forward in anticipation of hearing his voice for the very first time. "Marley was dead: to begin with." And so the evening began and continued to do so for three and a quarter hours. 

A Christmas Carol was written in 1843 and published in the same year that Henry Cole brought us the Christmas card; a time for rejoicing and initiating into our homes practices hitherto unheard of at the time, such as good cheer, sharing gifts, much merriment and even Christmas trees. Dickens's sources for the tale appear to be many and varied but are principally the humiliating experiences of his own childhood. But more than anything his distress at the conditions of the poor and the plight of children attending 'Ragged Schools'; organizations run voluntarily and dedicated to the free education of destitute children. It was visiting one such school and seeing the array of bright beaming faces that a seed was planted for a book, a book that he hoped would cheer people's hearts with generous fellowship. As soon as A Christmas Carol was published and the miserable images of Want and Ignorance, whom he describes as being, 'yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, were introduced, people immediately sat up and took notice. Changes were hurriedly made to the Poor Laws, the Factory Acts were repelled and with it came an end to child neglect and slavery. A Christmas Carol has achieved a kind of immortality, born out of the very conditions of the time. 

He poured into the story his own personal memories, especially that of Camden Town and the long walk that Bob Cratchit would have had to make to the City; of his sister Fanny's crippled four year old son, who took on the mantle of Tiny Tim. From his own deep self he drew the understanding that a grown man may pity the child he had been, and learn from that pity, as Scrooge does. 'In short I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the slightest license of a child and yet been man enough to know its value.' 

Dickens decided to set the tone of Carol through the eyes of one man. A mean, pinched, misanthropic old skinflint of a man, uncaring of others whose face 'wore the signs of care and avarice; a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, covetous old sinner; who carried such a low temperature about with him in the street that even the blind man's dog appeared to know him.' According to Dickens he stumbled upon the name while taking an evening walk through a graveyard in Edinburgh. Apparently the headstone was for the wine merchant Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose claim to fame was that he had won the first contract to supply whiskey to the Royal Navy. The inscription identified Scroggie as a 'meal mad (in other words a corn merchant), but, due to the fading light and Dickens mild dyslexia, he may have misread this as 'mean man.' But either way Ebenezer Scrooge, one of literature's most notorious characters, sprung immediately into life. Unfortunately the headstone was lost during reconstruction in 1932. 

It is generally believed that the character of Scrooge was largely based on Gabriel Grub who appeared in Dickens first novel, The Pickwick Papers. Gabriel Grub was a rather misanthropic gravedigger, an 'ill-conditioned, cross-grained, surly fellow, who eyed each merry face as it passed him by, with a deep scowl of malice and ill-humour.' To show his displeasure for the festive season and his keenness for money Gabriel begins to dig a grave on Christmas Eve only to be visited by a gaggle of goblins who drag him down to their goblin kingdom. There he is shown all sorts of misery, even the death of a small, much loved child and awakes a better man. 

Dickens began Carol in September 1843, and in keeping with the title of his work, divided the story into staves. (Using the word metaphorically, instead of chapters) Sometimes the emotion was too much and Dickens would have to break away and take long night walks, 'when, all sober folks had gone to bed,' covering anywhere between 15 or 20 miles. Six weeks later he completed it; and 'broke out' as he himself described, 'like a madman. Such dining, such dancing, such conjuring, such blind-man's buffing such theatre going, never took place in these parts before.' Thackeray, not always an admirer of Dickens, called it a 'national benefit,' an American entrepreneur gave his employees an extra days holiday and Thomas Carlyle went straight out and bought himself a turkey. Stoking up all this cheerfulness was the news that the book had sold 6000 copies at five shillings each on its first day; becoming the most successful Christmas book of the season. (Mind you five shillings was nearly a half week's wage for some). Dickens knew instinctively that he had created a modern fairy story and for the first time been able to complete an entire fiction without being compelled to write in serial form. 

After the success at Birmingham, Dickens took his readings to every major town and city in the country, across to Ireland and eventually the United States of America, where he was greeted like some iconic movie star. But the strain took its toll on his health and he would insist on his doctor sitting in the wings in case of the possibility he might collapse. 

He began with A Christmas Carol and he ended with it. His last reading of the little book took place in London at the St James' Hall, March 15th 1870. At the end of the performance he told his audience that 'from these garish lights I vanish now for evermore, with a heartfelt, grateful, respectful, and affectionate farewell.' There was a stunned silence immediately broken by a tumult of cheering, hat waving and the stamping of feet. With tears streaming down his face, Dickens raised his hands to his lips in an affectionate kiss and departed from the platform for ever; an infinitely sad and broken man. A few days later the Queen, at a private audience, regretted that she had not heard his reading. Dickens expressed his regret but explained he was unable to offer her a private performance, not on the grounds of infirmity, but because, as he told her, a mixed-class audience for him was essential. Etiquette kept him on his feet for the ninety minutes of their conversation, and as a mark of her esteemed respect the Queen did likewise. Charles Dickens was to die three months later at the age of 58. 

*Dickens wrote in the preface of A Christmas Carol:* 

**I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book to raise the Ghost of an Idea which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.**

*Their faithful Friend and Servant,*

*Charles Dickens*

 Thank you. I shall include those names in due course. 




 Thank you very much for that submission. It gives me much to sort through. Of those 560 some might fall outside the label 'artist'. I shall endeavor to follow this up further. 




 This is very much a work in progress. Please feel free to improve it if you can. 









 I'm looking to create a page that could perhaps become a Wikipedia article (or just remain in its current format). I'm sure that there are many more names that I could add. I also hope that it could potentially serve as a historical resource of value in its own right.

   "proven alternative treatments" - which is none.

If you're saying there are no proven treatments alternative to those currently provided by the NHS I disagree with you.
 









 A point of information: Poultry farmers aren't *forced* to do anything. It's a livelihood they have through choice.

 Sometimes it is credited as a first usage of a word when he uses a word as a verb where before it had only been used as a noun. And so on. 














 'Kick everyone in the throat' isn't the most felicitous of phrases. 




 I found the analysis of this incident informative and thought-provoking. The comments about society at large were stimulating. The details about the farming industry were revelatory. 

I feel the articles presentation of this incident and its fallout highlight an important and perhaps troubling aspect of the world today. 









 He who clings to the Void

And neglects compassion,

Does not reach the highest stage.

But he who practices only compassion

Does not gain release from the toils of existence.

He, however, who is strong in practice of both,

Remains neither in Samsara nor in Nirvana. 









 We've done our research

Are they prepared to show their working?

What is this rag? 




 I like that one. 
























 Good detective work. I'm prepared to concede the point.

*mutter mutter* 'Clara Oswald never existed'... *mutter mutter* 




 Both the Yana bit and the Gallifrey bit. 




 I think Missy's hand was *literally* in the DOTD. [See this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2l49j0/is_this_missy/).

 If money was no object, how would you like to spend your time? 




 Do they have Ipads in hell? 




 at that point he would have probably been in his Yana incarnation, and even then why would he be on Gallifrey during the Time War? Surely he would have escaped before it was destroyed.

What makes you say that?

 They'd want it to be obvious to those who caught it.

I think they are that sneaky. 




 Have you looked at my 'rings are different' evidence? What do you make of it? 




 it looks like Clara's hand.

Only to the very casual observer. Look at the difference: http://i.imgur.com/6wceTQN.png 




 Not 'the exact same rings' at all. Look: http://i.imgur.com/6wceTQN.png 




 Look at my comment about the rings being different. Subtle but undeniable. 




 Look closer. 




 The rings are different! Clara's ring in the promo pic has the thicker oval bit run parallel with her finger. The ring in the clip in the episode has the thicker bit run perpendicular to the wearer's finger.

The rings are definitely different. 




 Painted, not tattooed I imagine. Have you watched the clip again? (around the 8:54 mark - http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x18jnnn_day-of-the-doctor-part-2_shortfilms)

 Was just going to type that. 




 Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams. 




 That's too defeatist for my liking. 




 Thank you very much. 




 And not as powerful as they used to be either. 




 The conclusion might well be that there is a conspiracy among the London-based Welsh media to avoid presenting Wales as a country that can have diplomatic relations with other countries. The British states greatest fear must be that if Wales starts behaving like an independent country then it may become an independent state  just like Ireland.

His trip, they claim, was presented more like a holiday jolly than a state visit. 














 I recommend it. I think you'll like it.
