 My team and I are planning on developing Django based websites for local businesses. We are wondering how to go about hosting these Django sites for clients. Should we have them self manages by clients or should we manage hosting for a monthly fee? If so, what are some good hosts for this?

 I'm a high school junior looking to gain more experience and validity to my college application.
