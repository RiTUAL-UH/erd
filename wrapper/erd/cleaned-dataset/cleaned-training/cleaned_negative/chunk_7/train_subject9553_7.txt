 Yes and on May 7, 1915 the Lusitania sank, putting the US on an inextricable path towards war with Germany. I didn't say the US entered the war on May 7, 1915. 

The sinking of the Lusitania in and of itself is the conspiracy.  







































 Blame Gandhi, in 200 years of British colonialism and direct imperialism the subcontinent remained united. In one fell swoop Gandhi, Nehru and Churchill come to the genius conclusion that India needs to partition Punjab to create an Islamic state to stop religious violence (*that sure worked like a charm*) between Hindus and Muslims.  

[The Punjab region, the land of 5 rivers, is 137,000 square miles.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_region) 

[Compare that to the modern Indian state of Punjab which is just 19,000 square miles.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India)

It seems like Gandhi, Nehru and Muslim leadership in India reached a mutual conclusion to screw over the smallest minority in India, the Sikhs. They gutted Punjab, 19,000 square miles is nothing, to this day we have to share a state capitol with Haryana, in Chandigarh.  












































 Yes, its about the elephant.  









 I agree. The entire reason he did this was to prove that his form of direct current was superior to Tesla's method of alternating current. 

Pretty sick way to make a point. Here's a Wikipedia link about Topsy the elephant, killed at Coney Island by Edison:

 Goddammit ! That didn't take very long. It was such a good video too, the protester really figuratively slammed that MSNBC reporter.  



























































 I think the spike in downvote brigading has to do with the surge in mainstream media interest in the unrest taking place in Baltimore.

/r/videos is just like it was in the immediate aftermath of the Ferguson riots, Reddit's 2 minutes hate. Its all videos negatively depicting the protesters as all being rioters.  





































































 Removed. Violation of rule #1, this is your warning, further violations will result in a ban.  














































































































































































 Last I checked, Charmaleon wasn't a dragon and couldn't FLY !  




 Alright, but Charizard is still a lot cooler than Blastoise.
