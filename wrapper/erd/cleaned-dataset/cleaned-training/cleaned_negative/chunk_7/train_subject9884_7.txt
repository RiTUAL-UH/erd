 I guess that is what I would like. Work for a small company with inspiring people. I ground this website http://workinstartups.com/ but I have no chance of getting any of the jobs on there (they are looking for different skills)  




 I work in procurement. There are loads of jobs for me but it's all the same. I am good in procurement and planning both of which I don't like anymore... 




 That might be true actually. There was a fence where I was standing to take the picture.  









 That is exactly what I want to do. The only problem I am facing is that I don't know what job to apply to. If I look on the job sites, there are loads of "really good jobs" that I probably have a realistic shot at. But I'm not interested to just switch the company and do the same/similar stuff somewhere else. I just struggle to find what I want to do. I was hoping to get some ideas here by learning what other people to for a living.  




 Thanks for your feedback. I guess this is exactly what I am looking to do. I want to completely change. But I don't want to be a paramedic. I need inspiration.  




 Procurement in oil and gas. I don't want to do this anymore though. I just find it hard to find ideas of potential jobs I might be able to do with my education. 

 




 I guess that would be a good idea. However the main problem is that I don't know what kind of job I want to do. At the moment I work in procurement of an oil and gas company and it's so boring.  









 I have lived in London 4 years. The first year was university and then I started working and at the beginning I liked my corporate job. Money was good and I got to travel loads. 

By now I just hate it. Huge pressure on a daily basis and ever increasing levels of burocracy make me want to kill myself every day. Especially because at the end of the day I have nothing to look at and say: Well done, I made this or that or I helped him or her. 

If you are or have been at a similar point, do you have any recommendations?

I would like to find a job that is not the usual London corporate crazy. 




 Prove it!  




 Are you going this Sunday by any chance?  




 really? 









 Sorry, but I am sure it would have been better if the entire ship was in focus rather than part of the ship and some of the rocks on the shore. 




 You know what: I live in London and I always say the same thing. 

Last weekend I went to Bruges in Belgium and you know what? London is not that expensive (apart from rent?mortgage) You can do a lot for free and a lot of good food is available for good money. If you're modest you can have a good life and don't even need that much money for it.

 How many of them did you kill walking through them? 




 Where did he have them made? They are awesome 




 1984

I read it just before moving to a different country. I finished the book the first night in my new home. I felt so lonely that night 




 Will this replace windows or can I do dual boot? 




 AMIDUOS has root. See 2nd best comment here. 









 These things are still in use. Taxi Driver in Germany charged me like that. It worked. I was surprised.  




 Would a banana before the workout always be good?  




 I only had coffee yesterday and no water. I guess the reason was a mix of not drinking, too much coffee and not breathing. 




 I'll make sure I breathe
 




 Thanks. I'll try that. Difficult though. I guess I'll have to practice.  




 Thanks. I am hoping to be able to sort it out by breathing properly and drinking enough. I like to work out in the morning before I eat sometimes.  




 Hi, I am currently using the strong lifts 5x5 app and I really like it. It keeps me motivated and I have been to the gym 3 times a week for the last two months which is really good for me. 

I have been able to increase dead lifts from 70 kg to 100kg. Up until 95kg I found it hard, but not too hard. Last Friday I did 100kg for the first time. I did 5x 60kg and then 5x 80 kg as warm ups. Yesterday I was about to try 102.5 kg. However I had to stop. I did 5x 60kg and 5x 80kg warm up. When I wanted to do 5x 92.5kg warm up I did 2 reps and felt funny. I dropped the weight and almost fainted. In the end I was fine and nothing happened but I was very surprised. 

I have lifted that weight before a few times, so what could be the reason. I know that I failed to drink water throughout the day yesterday. Could that be it? Or did I not eat enough? Or is it likely that something else was the reason?

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback. Breathing and water seem to be key.  




 And they both look really good.  




 I don't know you and I do not know your background or opinion, so please don't take it personal.

If that is your reasoning then that's fine, but then don't complain later that rents are too high. (I am not saying you do)

I am just saying people have no integrity. They all want things to change but nobody is willing to do anything for it. The only thing people with money understand is if you boycott their BS. And if you want things to change you have to start with the man in the mirror and not just expect others to do the shitty work for you. 

Rents are too high in London? Don't move here or move away.

Rent for a certain flat is unacceptable? Don't move in. 

But then somebody else will move in there and nothing will change anyway and on top of that you don't have a flat and that other person does? Maybe. But maybe at some point everybody refuses this BS and we actually make a difference. Be the change that you want to see. I know it sounds so silly but it is true.  




 If people stop renting shit like this, people will stop offering shit like this. We cannot expect change if we are not willing pay a certain price for it.  




 Is this available in colour? 




 EDIT: Sorry guys, there is an s missing...  




 Did it on my commute. I'm really happy I did it. Was pretty easy and seems to work perfectly fine. 

Thanks for convincing me  




 Actually, just found it. 

http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/stock-firmware-23-1-0-690-generic-t3056413

I'll probably do it tomorrow during my lunch break. I hope I won't fuck it up.

Good night 




 Is there one for the z3c yet? I am currently looking on xda, but can't find it yet. 

Edit: Sorry, found it

http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/stock-firmware-23-1-0-690-generic-t3056413 




 Cool, you convinced me. Have you done it yet? 

Just saw, that is the file for the Z3. Is there one for the z3c yet? 




 People never lock their cars  




 I managed to get into recovery, yes. But I haven't had a chance to flash the rom yet. Not sure if I'm gonna do it. Not really interested to be honest. I am really happy now that I'm rooted and everything works. 

I'll let you know if I ever do it  




 Hey, thanks for taking the time. I really appreciate your post. I found this very helpful and insightful. I'll do some more research for myself and make up my mind what I think. 

Thanks again.  




 So, why would the government do this?

Which party actually wants to do this? And which party wants to prevent it? 




 I'm not sure I understand what it tells me. I mean I understand what  the figure means, but I have no idea what percentage is good or bad.  




 Thanks. That is something somebody said about the privatised trains in the UK. Same thing, right? Shit service, high prices because there is basically no competition and they are all profit maximising. 




 Thanks, I understand that that is a massive problem. Did not think about that.  




 Could you explain further? 




 I live in the UK but I am not from here. I am personally very thankful for the NHS because they have supported my SO a lot and without them we would have struggled a lot. 

I would like to know why people are concerned with privatisation and also would like to know why people support it.  




 I have rooted via giefroot and installed dual recovery. So I just put this on my SD card, enter TWRP and flash it, right?

But to be honest, I have no idea how to root in TWRP on my z3c. Do you know?

Edit: Ok, got it. Wait until the LED flashes during startup and then ress volume rocker. Sorry for the stupid question.  




 Thanks for replying. Can you tell me how to get into recovery? I can't figure it out  




 Do you hate her? 




 Hello,

I have successfully rooted my z3 compact yesterday and wanted to install Xposed framework but it comes up with an error message. Please see the screenshots here (2 pictures)

https://imgur.com/NLNC7YE,n4V4XpQ

Not sure what I can do to fix that. I tried to change the installation method, but that didn't work. (also because I can't enter recovery to flash manually)

Did anybody have a similar problem?  




 Dibs on the girl on the left. 




 Fair enough. Then I am afraid I have no solution.  




 Is it possible to use manufacturer specific widgets in Nova at all?

For example I can't use the Sony widgets. (they suck anyway, but just as an example) 




 Is there a video or gif set of all the sweet stuff that Nova can do?

I read through all that you guys post here but I can only imagine half of it. 
I also use Nova and love it, but I hardly see any significant changes for me other than the app search pull down thing.  




 just swipe up from the app drawer button 




 Thank you! 




 I think this is the coolest thing I have seen on here.

Well done.  




 Sorry if this is a basic question. If I only want root to use exposed and e.g. greenify it is enough to just do the giefroot thing right? 

I only need to back up my DRM keys if I want to unlock the bootloader, right? 




 What you say is right, but it sure looks like he works out.  




 How much storage do you guys need?  




 I don't know. I had the yoga tablet 1 8" and that is a very decent tablet. Yes, it's slow, yes the ui looks like shit but the kick stand and battery make up for everything. I use nova so it looks fine. The speed won't be an issue on the new version. I don't see how people are not interested in this. I absolutely love it.  




 I've been doing stronglifts 5x5. It's a 3 times per week workout and doesn't take very long. Good for beginners.  




 Whatsapp has a calling feature?
 




 Thank you. I'll try and create my own masterpiece. 




 What app? With a pen? 




 Nothing as of yet. 




 Did you ever realise that Jack always agreed with your morals? But sometimes Jack was able to see that it was a lost cause and instead of demoralising you he took the blame for not doing the morally right thing so that you could stay who you are.  




 It's horrible but your post was good fun to read. If nobody made these mistakes we would not get to read about them.  




 I enjoyed seeing that but I can't explain why  




 It's true. I posted a stupid question got stupid answers. Next day I went to the gym, started the 5x5 strength thing and  2 weeks later I feel like I am on the right track. I got inspired by one of the top posts (the female ) and just did it. I'm still adjusting my diet but at least I've started and I did it by reading other posts  




 *couldn't

But other than that I agree  




 Personally I don't mind if things take longer but I don't like when people put off telling people that it's going to take longer until it's obvious it's gonna take longer because you've passed the deadline 




 I disagree, but whatever works for you man.  




 The tp is covered in piss though... 














 Nobody commented. It is pretty obvious nobody cares.  




 Nobody cares...  




 iPhones have shit battery life I guess. 




 Thanks, but I don't want it to be ELI5. 

/r/askscience is probably a good idea though.  









 Why 5?
 




 I said the same to the other guy:

Sorry man, I realise that the information I have provided is BS. I'll do a second post later with better information, pics and goal.
Sorry to waste your time.

Sorry to waste your time.  




 This is what I found.

Calves (any exercise) - 1x12-16

Could not find the other one. Do you have a link?

 




 Hey, thanks for your answer. 

For point 1, this is from the second link in the side bar:

+20% maintenance calories on workout days, -20% maintenance on non-workout days. Varying your caloric amounts is important

If it's wrong, why is it in the sidebar?

And for the second point I was considering to do this all in one day three times a week. I have been doing the same exercises for the past 3 months (however as bodyweight exercises). I do not think it would be a problem. Why do you think it would be pointless? 
If I split that over 3 days, I will be in the gym for 30 minutes only. 

EDIT: Sorry, I forgot: My goal is to do a recomp as described in the sidebar link. I do not really want to lose weight or bulk. Just want to look fitter and get stronger. I weigh 79kg and I have been doing bodyweightfitness for the last three months.  




 Edit: Sorry guys, this was a bullshit post. Just ignore please.  









 So? Am I not allowed to have an opinion that is based on my personal experience? 




 You guys are impossible to talk to. I have my own experience with something and I will not just be all "My judgement must be 100% wrong then just because I have not researched it". Stoners are slow in the head, that is my experience with every single one of them who smokes on a regular basis (several times a week) 




 Well I know lots of guys who drank shit loads of alcohol and they seem to be functioning fine today. The few heavy smokers I know are really slow when you talk to them. I think it really did negatively affect them  




 Very sexual 




 You're right. However OP asked and the4ndy answered his question. I think we can all be happy  




 Do you always politely add information by starting with "Woah woah woah watch the phrasing there."? 




 Thanks for pointing out the obvious mate.  




 I think you got this wrong, but I am not sure. 

There is no grey area. As soon as you download it is illegal. However, when you stream the file is only temporarily on your computer and you have no access to it so that you could copy it. That is why streaming is still ok. Torrenting is not legal anywhere in Europe. This is why you should not use popcorn time in Europe if you are scare of getting caught. Neither the uploading nor the downloading is legal.  




 Crap. Thanks for replying though. I guess nothing I can do. 




 Hi,

My SO has an Acer S3 ([this one](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Acer-Aspire-S3-391-53314G52add-Ultrabook.81619.0.html)). We decided to install Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. 

Now the problem is that the laptop won't boot with an HDMI cable attached to it. If you remove the cable it boots fine. If you attach the cable after it booted, it works fine. 

We use a HDMI to DVI cable, but it also does not work with an HDMI to HDMI cable or with a different screen. 

If anybody has had this before, we would really appreciate if you could share your solution. It is nothing bad, just an inconvenience to always remove the cable before booting. 

But I even if it can't be fixed I would like to understand it.

Many thanks in advance. 




 Thank you very much! 




 I like this. But why do you think the ring is not his totem? 









 Slow mo takes away a lot from their performance 




 I got myself a rice cooker with a steaming tray. Whilst the rice is boiling the salmon broccoli and other veg are steaming. After I add soy sauce and: BOOM! a full and delicious meal full of good fat, protein and, well, carbs. 

I hope youlike salmon, otherwise never mind. 

EDIT: [This is the one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Russell-Hobbs-19750-Cooker-Steamer/dp/B00ABYI0IE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1423839560 sr=8-1 keywords=rice+cooker) 




 Yes, I remembered that. That is just to suggest it might fall. 

What's your point? 




 I think this is right. I never thought about this.  




 Ok, I think you are right. I never considered this.  




 I did not know that 




 I accept that the joke is no good. And it's fair enough that you don't find it funny.

But please don't speak for others. You have no idea why they downvoted.  




 Reddit is just too politically correct. Unless you ask for politically incorrect jokes. 




 I have read that as well, but I don't think so. I would have also gone to see my children first. 

Throughout the whole movie he wants nothing more than the truth. I don't think he would change just like that. 




 I understand your point and appreciate it. I would have just liked if the totem would have dropped from the table and rolled under something so that we and also Leo would never find out. 

This way it seems so obvious Leo will find out and we won't 




 I know there are endless explanations about why people think Leo is still in a dream e.g. the thing with the wedding ring. 

I have a very different problem with the film:

For me as a spectator the film ends after the final scene and I am left to wonder whether he is still trapped in a dream or not. That is fair enough and I guess what Nolan wanted. 

However, when I watch a film, I try to imagine that the characters are real, right? And that is why the ending is bullshit. For me as a spectator the movie stops right there, but for Leo it doesn't. He will come back into the house eventually and see if his totem is still spinning or not. That means for him there are two scenarios: 

1. By the time he comes back into the house the totem stopped spinning and he lives happily with his children
2. He comes back in and the thing is still spinning - He knows he was fooled and is still in a dream. He actually wants to get back into the real world so if this happens, the story is not over for him.

So if Nolan wanted an open ending he should have gotten rid of the totem before anybody (us or Leo) was able to find out if the totem will drop. This way he just fails to tell us the end of the story.  




 Fair enough, but not at the price of sacrificing Jgers I would have thought  




 Was it? I don't want to watch again.  




 Was it the woman chucking it? If so I think it's realistic 

Edit: Come one guys. A little sexism doesn't hurt. 




 Similarly the monsters simply choose not to use their EMP all the time. What's the point saving ammunition if it will cost them their life?  




 Apparently the Jger has a very powerful sword on board which is not being used during the first fights. The monsters deal considerable damage to the humans which could have been avoided if the sword would have been used instead of a tanker  




 This is awesome. She is not my type at all but I love the way she is such a dude
