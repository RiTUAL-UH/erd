 Asylum is a place of refuge. We have far too few inpatient psych beds for long term care. The taxpayers don't want to pay for it. Too often the acutely ill board in emergency departments because there's no safe place to send them. Inhumane. 




 Down California you've got 101 and 1 on the coast, I-5  down the middle-if you like agriculture there's plenty here, and 395 east of the Sierra. I live in Olympia WA, my sister lives in Santa Cruz CA so I know them all well. Returned yesterday from a trip down the coast to San Luis Obispo, east to 395, then up the interior home again. 2800 miles, took a leisurely 7 days.

One of my favorite stretches is south of Eureka, cut over on 1 on the coast from 101 at Leggett. Very twisty, though forest then you can smell the sea and the ocean is before you. If you're staying in motels reserve ahead by midafternoon 'cause things fill up in the afternoon, but there are plenty of fantastic campgrounds, too. 

You are going to have a great adventure, but don't worry about missing anything-it'll be there for the next trip!

 I'll take midges over wasps any day. I wear a full face helmet but keep the visor up unless it's too cold, it's raining or too many bugs. It helps that my GS has an excellent windscreen.

Last summer a damned wasp hit me on the lip-ow! Then stung me OW! before it died.

Did I learn my lesson? Do I ride with a closed visor now? I love the wind on my face, it's like a drug. And I'm stubborn. So no.

 I remember on rounds on the ID service in residency, 1980s so no EHR, the attending pointed out patient problems (change in wound, stool pattern, cognition  c) might first be documented in the nurses notes 2-3 days before they showed up in the physician progress notes. Now it's mostly templated fluff. 




 Exactly. Always sifting through the cut and paste to get to the narrative.

APSO format for progress notes is intended to lead with the narrative, but it often merely copies the problem list forward. I might get "Pt X tolerated diet and is working with PT", then the problem list.

I don't think the problem is inherent in the software. It's what the provider chooses to do with it that irks me. I would make one exception to this statement. The defense department's [AHLTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Health_Longitudinal_Technology_Application). It is in its own world of uselessness.  




 One cannot help wonder what race relations would be like in America today if both these men were still alive. 




 Parrots, fuck yeah! 




 We have an EMR that goes to 2001, and scanned notes (which have consultant notes, study and pathology reports, and so on) so the story's there. Best are previously dictated H P, DC summary.

A physician is a detective, at least for hospital medicine. I cannot imagine how this would be accomplished in 15 minute appointments. 




 Probably not: these were likely *all male* groups, and also it would violate the sanctity of the right of the pizza peddler not to believe in evolution. 




 Now it's a real rivalry-so much more interesting. May they both stay strong for a great season! 




 Don't be superstitious. I'm more worried about Marquez. The longer you ride wild, the more the chance for a serious getoff. Doesn't he already hold the record for the fastest noninjury crash? 




 . . .  stuck in traffic. . .Heh 




 I've seen H Ps for pt admiited for elective joint replacement, written by the PA to satisfy hospital documentation requirements. All cut and paste, don't even describe the procedure.

On the other hand one of my cardiologist friends writes exemplary notes like yours. In this case the procedures, most recent ECHO, stress test  c are easy to find. He even provides references regarding the indications for devices or medications. A gold mine-not only are essential patient data provided, there's a bonus tutorial! Now if he'd only answer a page at night (a *very* sound sleeper). 




 There's the beginnings of a novel there, like Bukowski did for the Post Office 




 Your notes have far more free text than I usually see.  




 I've been using computers since the 1970s, and I love EPIC. I find great notes and crummy notes. Cut and paste as a portion of the note is very valuable, but as the whole note it's not. 




 I've been using Dragon for years, but not every work station has the software loaded. Many of my free texts notes are short and to the point anyhow:

Notified of AFib recurrence, rate 120s, asymptomatic. Systolic 120s. Will check electrolytes, bolus 10 IV dilt and continue to monitor

Hardly worth logging on to dragon for that. As for admit, consult, procedure, discharge, death notes  c I dictate, which uses speech to text, edited by transcription services, then sent to me for final edit. 




 When a patient has been in the hospital for a week and there is a crisis at night when cross cover needs to figure out what is going on the narrative of their hospital course is not optional. If I can't figure it out from the notes I must reconstruct it, which hardly is an advance in patient care. I'll take a pithy, short surgeon's note over the long empty templated progress note anytime. 




 I never ignore a page,  although there are times when there are many pages awaiting replies. I can only answer one at a time. Dictating an admit note takes 5 to 10 minutes; the expect page return time is 15 minutes. 

Texting is most useful with coworkers, such as "please staff this case with the housestaff', "pager switched to oncoming provider, no patients waiting",  c. 




 I am an employee of a multihospital nonprofit, and my collegues tell me I'm efficient. I'm quite satisfied with my job, and use texting all the time. To me it is not a net improvement, although it certainly has benefits. 




 My secret is exposed.  




 As a nocturnist I do principally admissions, consults and cross cover. I believe my admit note should provide the care team with a comprehensive and concise review of the past medical history. The history usually listed in EPIC and other similar EMRs is usually worthless. "Chronic airway obstruction, not elsewhere classified [496]" cannot replace "Severe steroid and oxygen dependent COPD with continued smoking". Nor can "Coronary atherosclerosis of unspecified type of vessel, native or graft [414.00]" replace "Coronary artery disease with 2-vessel bypass in 1999. Subsequent drug-eluting stents on dual antiplatelet therapy" 




 A very succinct comparison. 




 Not one of the 54 inpatient physicians in my department are satisfied by the current text vendor, Tiger Text. It is cumbersome and unreliable. The chief of heme/onc refuses to use one, and relies on a traditional pager. But he's a head of department and may do so. The rest of us put up with it.

I do not type well, and I text even more slowly. It is not  convenient in the least for me, and we have been using texting for seven years. 




 Most texts are the number to call, but some may describe a patient problem and suggest a remedy. These require a dialog, and it's faster for me to discuss the scenario than text. When busy I am getting multiple texts/dialogs, and so often when dictating, it seems, which is distracting. I will mute the ~~hated~~ helpful and necessary device when dictating. 




 I find your sources to be very weak support for your statements. My undergraduate work was in the neurosciences; the literature on behavioral health is, by necessity, inferential and firm conclusions are rare. I remain unpersuaded by the efficacy of accupuncture. I have worked in practices which included accupuncture practitioners, and have had an opportunity to listen to the rationale and review the literature.

Most of the early data on neurointerventional salvage therapy was proprietor sponsored and not reproducible. More recent data are more persuasive, but many await more studies.

I find "Simply sticking your fingers in your ears and ignoring new alternatives because they seem different to your tried and true methods" personally insulting and this adds nothing to your arguments. Let us be objective, please. 




 I am not adept with keying in text, and would rather have a spoken dialog, and these notes are mostly barren of the narrative of a patient's care. 




 The easy stuff is over.

May it be a labor of love for you as it is for most physicians. 




 I use electrolyte replacement by protocol routinely for ICU pts, excepting DKA, ESRD. These two I prefer a dialog with the ICU team. Often ICU nurses will write "verbal orders" anyway, which I find a day or two later in my in box. Mixed feelings about that.

When it's busy it can be vexing for the nurses and physicians to take the time for these mandatory phone calls regarding "critical" results that aren't.

 I would think Columbia would take more care with their reputation, for certainly the referring physician who is worth their salt will look askance at an institute that employs a known fraud and quack.

But then again even the once venerable Cleveland Clinic decided to go for the gold and offer [alternative quackery](http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/wellness/integrative-medicine).  




 I use metoclopramide for two indications: 1) acute nausea and vomiting, and then as a second or third line agent (ondansetron is first) and 2) severe diabetic gastroparesis, and then only explaining the risk of irreversible tardive dyskinesia. There is no good treatment for the latter, as all agents exhibit tachyphylaxis.

I know of no data to support the assertion that metoclopramide has any effect on LES tone, and I have never seen it used for GERD. 

Tardive dyskinesia can be quite unpleasant. One patient said it even disturbed his sleep, and that sometimes he would bite his lip or tongue.

When the Airborne Officer went to the home of Daisy Bates, the local head of the NAACP, where the children were waiting to go to school, he saluted and said "Mrs Bates, we're ready for the Children." Minniejean Brown, one of the children, later recalled  "For the first time in my life I felt like an American Citizen."

 Spotsylvania County, Va. May 10

Dear Father

This is my last letter to you. I went into battle this evening as courier for Genl. Heth. I have been struck by a piece of shell and my right shoulder is horribly mangled   I know death is inevitable. I am very weak but I write to you because I know you would be delighted to read a word from your dying son. I know death is near, that I will die far from home and friends of my early youth but I have friends here too who are kind to me. My friend Fairfax will write you at my request and give you the particulars of my death. My grave will be marked so that you may visit it if you desire to do so, but it is optionary with you whether you let my remains rest here or in Miss. I would like to rest in the grave yard with my dear mother and brothers but it's a matter of minor importance. Let us all try to reunite in heaven. I pray my God to forgive my sins and I feel that his promises are true that he will forgive me and save me. Give my love to all my friends. My strength fails me. My horse and my equipments will be left for you. Again, a long farewell to you. May we meet in heaven.

Your dying son,

J.R. Montgomery
