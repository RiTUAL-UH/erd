 There are pressure plates on the other side forcing them to spawn in the [string](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/2hzs4d/a_ridiculously_quick_nether_portal_trap_imagine/) that updates the piston. 




 People spawn in string that is next to the piston and then the portal automatically closes behind anyone who goes through it :}


Edit: Explain better
