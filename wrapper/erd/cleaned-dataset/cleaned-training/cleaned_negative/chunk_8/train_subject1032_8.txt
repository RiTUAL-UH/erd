Wasn't the one I wanted with the crawling weenies :( 




 Went to the comments section just to see if anyone would make this reference! 
Haha Weiners!!!! 




 Can confirm. Used to work as a manager at one, and when we cash out the registers, we have to match up the "promos" (coupons) with the sales report. 
Too many promos and with nothing to show for it, would look suspicious. 




 Fucking up bad at work and it looks like, through the cameras, you helped someone steal a couple hundred dollars worth of cigarettes and threatened by management of being charged as an accomplice if the cigarettes or money doesn't show up soon. 




 I really enjoyed the little easter eggs that littered the pictures. I think that caught my eye more hahaha. 




 You can make me a fan at everything! ;)
