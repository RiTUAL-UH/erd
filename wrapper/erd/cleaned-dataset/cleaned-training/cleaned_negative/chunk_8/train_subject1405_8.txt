 excellent point. a hot sausage would really boost the savory 




 [Butternut Squash Lasagna](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/04/26/foodiesphere-butternut-squash-lasagna/)  
Ingredients:  
2 cups butternut squash puree  
2 cup ricotta cheese  
1/2 cup milk  
teaspoon salt  
teaspoon nutmeg  
2 cups fresh baby spinach (8 oz)  
2.5 cups mozzarella cheese  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
10 oz lasagna noodles, cooked  
cup Parmesan cheese  

Directions:  
First, you will need to make your butternut squash into a puree. Cut your squash in half length-wise. Scoop out and discard the seeds. Place both halves on a tray and bake for 30 minutes at 400. Remove from the oven and let it cool a bit so you can handle it. Then scoop out the squash and discard the skin/rind. Put the squash in a blender/food processor until it is creamy. Once you have the puree, add a cup of ricotta to it along with the milk, half a teaspoon of salt, and nutmeg. Blend it up. Put the mixture into a bowl and set aside.  In a pan, saute the garlic and cook down your spinach until it is wilty. Remove from heat and combine with the rest of the ricotta and a cup of mozzarella. Set aside.  Now youll need to cook the lasagna noodles. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add your noodles, add some salt, and cook until soft (but not mushy or easily broken). Drain the water and set the noodles aside.   In a baking or casserole dish, spread out a layer of the butternut squash mixture. Then place some of the lasagna noodles over it. Atop the noodles spread the spinach mixture. The next layer of noodles, then squash mixture, then spinach. Repeat until you have the layers that you prefer. I love cheese so over each spinach layer I added more of the remaining cheese but make sure you have enough cheese left over to coat the top. With your oven set to 375, bake the dish for 30 minutes or until the top layer is nicely brown.

 [Two Spaghetti Squash Recipes](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/04/22/foodiesphere-two-spaghetti-squash-recipes/)



Spaghetti Squash and Tomato Bake
Ingredients: 
* one spaghetti squash
* 2 large garden tomatoes sliced medium-thick
* teaspoon salt
* half teaspoon garlic powder
* half teaspoon onion powder
* tablespoon dried basil
* tablespoon dried parsley
* 2 cups shredded cheese (Ive used mozzarella and sharp cheddar)

Directions: Cooking the squash and gutting it will take the most time and effort. I prefer to cook squashes in my microwave but traditionally theyre baked in an oven. So, I stab holes all around the squash and put into the microwave for 10 minutes on high. I pull it out, check to see if its soft enough (its damn hot so be careful), and usually put it in for another 10 minutes. Once out, I cut it in half. I let it cool for a couple of minutes so that I can handle it but gutting the squash is best done while its warm. With a fork, you scratch out the meat of the squash. This is where itll become clear how it got its name.

Evenly spread about half of the squash out on the bottom of your casserole or baking dish. Then place half of your tomato slices over it. You should mix all the spices together and sprinkle half of it over the tomatoes. I love cheese, so I sprinkle it over the tomatoes as well. Spread the rest of squash atop that, then the rest of the tomatoes, sprinkle the remaining spices, then the remaining cheese. I like to add a little extra basil and parsley on top of the cheese. Put the dish uncovered in the oven at 350 and bake for about 30 minutes or until the cheese is well melted.


Spaghetti Squash Carbonara
Ingredients: 
* one spaghetti squash
* 6 slices of bacon cut into strips or squares
* cup of chicken broth
* 1.5 cup of shredded parmesan cheese
* 2 eggs
* 2 cloves of minced garlic
* teaspoons salt


Directions: Cook the squash, shred it with a fork, and put it in a bowl and set it in the refrigerator. In a saucepan, fry the bacon. Before it gets crispy, throw in the garlic. Once your bacon is cooked to your liking, add the chicken broth. Stir the broth and let it cook until about half of it has boiled off. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, cheese, and salt. Add to the saucepan and mix well. Itll get a bit creamy looking as the cheese melts, this is when you add the squash and mix it up well. 




 not very long. the cheese should melt enough that it starts to appear 'creamy.' I wouldn't wait more than a minute or so before adding the squash (and I did so not all at once but in batches)

 after seeing what Netflix was able to do with Daredevil, I can't help but see the networks as poorly done 




 that would be my worry too. it could get Disney-ified all too easily 







































 also, it's the Michigan Bucks that hold the rights to the Detroit area to bring in a USL team 




 we're all ignoring the possibility of OKFC, sponsored by the Colonel 






















































 "SJW" is a fiction  












































 wave your dick boy 














 I'll share with my fellow soccer fans whatever the hell I want. If you don't want to read it, then don't fucking read it. there's plenty out there for all 





































































 what I like about mythic beasts   monsters is the metaphor. I feel like all the vampire stuff over the last few years has been lacking in metaphorical depth replacing it with action or romance 














 it's not 'MinU.' ever 




 MinnyUFC? nope 




 exactly. why wouldn't they 





























 it's rather filling on its own. I thought about making basmati rice or naan to go with it, but really I don't think it needs it 














 imagine playing Football Manager without a mod 









 [Shakshuka with feta](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/foodiesphere-one-pan-shakshuka-with-feta/)

Ingredients--
Olive oil;
Onion;
2 red bell peppers;
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced;
1 teaspoon cumin (I was more liberal with my cumin   paprika, but at least a teaspoon each);
1 teaspoon paprika;
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper;
2 cans (14.5 oz.) diced tomatoes;
1 teaspoon salt;
1 teaspoon black pepper;
12 ounces feta cheese crumbles;
6-7 eggs 

Directions
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Finely chop onion and add with chopped bell peppers and garlic once the pan is hot. Saute until fragrant and soft (at least 15 minutes). Add spices (cumin, paprika and cayenne) and stir well for about a minute. Pour in tomatoes adding salt and pepper to taste. Stir the whole thing letting it simmer for at least 10 minutes. The mixture should thicken slightly and once it does add feta. Once youve mixed the feta in, create a few pockets where you can crack the eggs into. With the eggs cooking, I like to reduce the heat a bit and cover the pan so that they poach, which takes about 10 minutes.

 I think most of us Minnesota United fans prefer the MNU or MNUFC and not the 'MinU' 












































 maybe the Red Loons could come up with a hypothetical NASL players union contract. equal parts snark   serious 




 there does need to be more marxist takes about the goings-on 




 yeah, he was the catalyst in Rochester. really the only thing that made that team click. if he gets minutes he'll be one of those guys that's dangerous on his own but makes the other around him better 







































 well, damn, this is getting bought no matter what
