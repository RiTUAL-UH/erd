 Interesting. I remember hearing Metro Station's [Shake It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wjFahULCK8), which was released in 2008 about seven years before its release, multiple times. I even told other people who agreed that they could remember hearing it years before 2008. 














 She has the jaw, forehead, and lips of a man. 




 Serbian war crimes? 














 China, with its millions and millions of lonely men will develop a huge sex industry if the situation doesn't change anytime soon. Porn will be rampant and have a huge market. Many women will take advantage of the situation by becoming prostitutes, strippers, porn stars, and escorts. Men will take advantage by being pimps, opening up strip clubs, distributing pornography, acting in porn, or even crossdressing to prostitute themselves as women. Some of those who profit off the situation may become very wealthy. 



















 Well, I have been reading a little too much /r/futurology lately and a lot of the commenters predict a bleak future for driving, but I'm not sure if that's because they think that's what will happen or what they want to happen.

 Taxes are lowered for the rich, increased for everybody else. This decreases the number of corporations leaving the U.S.

 I could see something like this in Portland, San Francisco, Austin, or Minneapolis. 









 As much as I am disgusted by smoking, I can still tell that banning tobacco would be a step in the wrong direction. 




 Nice to see that there are other young people and other redditors out there who like 70s American cars. 




 Also, do they sell it in Germany or Austria?

I've always thought the same thing about "SS" cars. 




 Something will happen if the Republican Party doesn't get any younger and ages out. 














 Well, this turned into a circlejerk real quickly. No pun intended. 




 Toyota Land Cruiser. Starts at 80k and looks like a bigger, blander version of the Sequoia. Not a bad truck until you realize that the Range Rover Sport and Cadillac Escalade start at about the same price and actually look like what you pay for them.

 America will no longer have a two-party system. The Libertarian, Green, and Independent parties will grow. 









 Makes sense now that you say it. 




 Found a render of what a coupe version of the current gen CTS could look like,

http://tripedali.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cadillac-2015-CTS-V-Coupe.jpg 




 Don't think Iv'e ever seen one in person, I imagined it being bigger than a CTS coupe though. 



















 ~~[Cadillac ELR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_ELR)~~ 




 - Morgan makes modern cars that look like they are from the 1920s-30s.

- The Bentley Arnage and Chrysler 300 are big and boxy like 80s cars.

- The 2000-09 Jaguar XJ has the same basic shape as the 1968 XJ. 




 I could see this potentially resulting in a Waco or Ruby Ridge style siege if the government finds out and feels that enough illegal activity is occurring there. 





























 He probably did, if you consider that this happened, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyou_eKlr0U

 3D printing will increase crime by making it easier to make homemade guns, knockoff goods, copies of keys, fake credit cards, fake IDs, and counterfeit coins. 









 Think quickly, honk, and do whatever you can. Move over, brake, or speed up depending on the situation. I've nearly been nudged twice by drivers changing lanes without looking at 30-45 mph. In your case it sounds like the other car got in front of you and was on your front bumper. I'm imagining that I would have to brake to make room for them and try to notice early. Being in New York I'm pretty used to assholes not signaling and cutting other cars off. Having a dashcam would probably also be beneficial. 




 The wheels might be big though, 19-20 inch rims are optional on the S Class. Also, Acura has a similar looking lighting system on some of their cars. 




 Because he doesn't understand that the CLS is a high tech luxury car. My mom says she used to be able to wash the interior of her bare bones 1970 Chevy Nova with a garden hose. 









 To me it looks like an $80-$110k car, but I could see it being priced lower since Lincoln has generally priced its cars lower than the European counterparts. 




 Will it be a Livery cab/Uber/rental car like the Town Car, a near-luxury sedan like the Chrysler 300, or an actual competitor with cars such as the Lexus LS and Mercedes S550?

http://m.caranddriver.com/news/lincoln-continental-concept-revealed-news 




 That sounds a lot like Ancient Rome or Greece. 



















 Holy shit, I instantly thought Mitsubishi Mirage as the answer to the question. Then I look at the article and see a picture of the Mirage. 









 What if he is right?

Ha what? Google, Audi, Mercedes, freightliner and who knows what other companies have already driven a combined million+ miles, and crossed the US driverlessly. Technology companies like apple, uber, Delphi, Cisco systems, and nvidia are all competing to release driverless car technology. 

That doesn't mean that the technology will become mainstream or be perfected.

There are already mass produced cars on the road today that have lane departure warnings, emergency braking, self parking, and adaptive cruise control features.

Electronic driver assist features and self driving cars are not the same thing.

The government is making rules mandating technology that will allow vehicles to communicate with each other, which is pretty much the biggest barrier to autonomous vehicle technology working on a large scale. 

This is still very early in development and may be used either in autonomous or human driven cars.

And pretty much every single car manufacturer in existence will readily admit that autonomous cars are an inevitability. Your prediction is wrong you fudgetosser. 

If they don't become an inevatibility, that wouldn't be the first time a prediction of the future didn't come true. 



















 You might be able to get a better "normal" Crown Vic for the same price.

 A lot of 80s American cars looked like Rolls Royces, http://i.imgur.com/F6h2JtA.jpg 




 Boxy style or round style? 




 I actually don't see it as ugly. It's not the prettiest, but still a decent, simple, elegant design for what it is, http://www.collectorcarads.com/Picture1/Pontiac1985003.jpg 














 I thought of this because every year used to feel different to me, but not anymore. 2013, 2014, and 2015 have all felt the same to me, even though there have been major changes in my life since 2013.

 Morgan, Backdraft, Factory Five, AC, TVR, and Wiesmann are some successful, long lasting, niche sports car manufacturers. 









 The OLdsmobile Diesel engines used in 1977-85 GM cars, such as the Bonneville were terribly unreliable, http://www.autosavant.com/2009/08/11/the-cars-that-killed-gm-the-oldsmobile-diesel/ 




 Whatever you do, don't touch it if its a diesel.

 Mature means miniaturized, mass produced, cheap, and little room for new improvements. Most current tech is at its height and future technologies such as A.I. are either as far as they will get, will not catch on, or may be banned. It's interesting that you mentioned AI because many experts, such as Steven Hawking and Bill Gates believe that it will end humanity if it becomes too advanced. If enough support their view, certain forms of AI may be banned. 




 Sprinter van? 




 I watched some of his videos and can't tell what kind of mental illness he's suffering from. He also wasn't a bad looking guy before getting his face covered in tattoos. 




 Reminds me of this annoying teacher I used to have. 




 Not as shitty as GG Allin's tattoos were. 




 So do I, that's part of why I hate him and am fascinated by him at the same time. 




 It is since there was never a Mercury over there.

 Why can't this get labeled "comment score below threshold"? 









 I realized that Playback FM in GTA San Andreas is called an "old school hip hop" station, yet the songs range in year from 1987-1992. This means that the oldest songs are 5 years old and the newest one is from the year the game takes place.

 Should have written "continue to coexist", but I just wrote coexist because they haven't become widespread everywhere yet. 




 By coexist I mean be chosen by different people with different needs and preferences, kind of like diesel and gasoline has been for decades.

 Real people do dumb shit. Who's not going to strap-on a Go-Pro and try car surfing when the car can't crash? Wanna bang in the back seat while Robo-Bob drives? etc... There's going to be some sort of freak accident where some family drowns when the car drives on a correctly mapped road through a flash-flood or something a human driver could have easily avoided.

Thats one of the things that makes me worry about self driving cars. They will bring out people's stupidity because they trust the computer too much. I could also see a trend of dumb kids jumping in front of self driving cars to see if they get hit or not occuring.

The main problem I see with trucks would seem to be that the absence of a human operator combined with accident avoidance software would seem to make such vehicles easy targets for criminals (cargo hijackers).

Couldn't the trucks be manned by guards even if they are self driving? 




 The fact that the current concepts are slow and overly cautious, cannot be used in harsh conditions, and don't recognize the color of traffic lights in the sun are some more problems. 









 I ask this because most of the news regarding them seems to be made of hype and because similar concepts which were said to be the future of transportation such as [Personal Rapid Transit](http://www.tbd.com/blogs/tbd-on-foot/2011/07/metro-history-the-1970s-thrill-surrounding-personal-rapid-transit-prt--11713.html) and flying cars were tested in in the 1950's-80's but were never perfected and never became widely used. 




 I have wondered if electric will replace fuel or if it will coexist with it like diesel does with gasoline now.

 He can't go 120 on the highway if he doesn't want to be "that guy". 




 Did he say he ever actually went 120 on the highway? Whether he did or not, this is still a dumb question that should be self-explanatory for him. 









 Right, but in the case of the Matrix/Vibe and 3000GT/Stealth etc. didnt both companies own shares in each other? 




 The iA clearly looks like a Mazda 3, the iM looks more like a Prius or CT. I guess they could be on the same platform, but I never knew that Toyota/Scion owned Mazda. 




 The iM looks like a rebadged Lexus CT.
