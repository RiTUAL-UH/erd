 Welcome /u/jorgepal02 to r/stopdrinking--At [this link is a post called the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is an accurate summary of what I did to stop drinking and get sober.  I still do these things.  Good luck and I hope I see you continue to post and comment as you go along. 









 That's great, /u/saltwatermonkey -- when you get and stay sober you get your life back. 




 Congratulations on 7 years SOBER.  I just put an invite to join us on /r/dinos in your inbox.   



















 There are absolutists among philosophers of honesty.  For instance leaving a false impression or creating a misimpression is also lying.  We have an affirmative duty in my opinion to correct lies.  Which is my  way of saying that I'm not advocating white lies with this post; I'm saying let us not justify unnecessary cruelty to others under the guise of "brutal honesty."   




 I think this is a valid point.  The constant lying about and covering up for my drinking were more than enough to cause all sorts of distortions in my character.   




 Wonderful.  What a great sensation that is.   




 I am not going to drink TODAY because I am not going to drive drunk with people in my car.  I've done that too, my young children.   




 In early sobriety I ill-advisably dated (and briefly lived with) a young woman, Audrey, who long timers on /r/stopdrinking have heard me speak of in past posts and comments usually in the context of why it's not a good idea to date in early sobriety.

One of Audrey's most striking characteristics was her tendency to pop off to her "friends" or newcomers in AA in a manner in which she would shrug and say, "'Sorry, I'm brutally honest." Except she wasn't, she was merely brutal.  This week while we talk about Honesty remember that in striving to be more honest, we can not and should not justify our rude and unsupportive behavior as "brutal honesty."  In sobriety we reserve brutal honesty for the man or woman in the mirror.  

When my SO asks if she looks fat in a dress, skirt, slacks--no amount of karma was ever earned by saying "Yes." 




 The person who is brutally honest enjoys the brutality quite as much as the honesty. Possibly more.  Richard Needham, (1912-1996) Canadian educator and cartoonist. 




 You're doing it right and becoming a real power of example, /u/Andrew_Tefft.  Please keep doing what you are doing.

 One of the best investments I ever made was in a [Blackburn high pressure pump.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NFX298U/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_3?pf_rd_p=1944687642 pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1 pf_rd_t=201 pf_rd_i=B005ZGQFDK pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_r=1HZ9YKXGRJH8G6KG1HRZ)  Nothing you can do to make yourself go faster and with fewer punctures than to run a max pressure (even slightly higher) on good tires. 









 Mano a Mano! 














 LOL. 




 Congratulations, my friend.  I am so happy for you. 




 Congratulations, you sound like you're doing it right! 




 Great news!  Congratulations.

 At the same time he said waterboarding was torture and "not what we're about." 




 So what you're saying is: he doesn't have a buck to his name? 




 Yeah, I think you're wrong about Graham's position on torture.  Remember this is McCain's closest Senate ally and my recollection is that the two of them are zealously anti-torture. 




 Maybe the last of my generation, then.  It's a little dated at this point, but I thought it captured some core truths. 




 The 7th or 8th drink was never my downfall.  It was always the first. 




 While I don't sympathize with Graham's let's-fight-every-war obsession; I don't think it's fair to label him a Chicken Hawk.  Until recently he was a commissioned US Air Force JAG officer--not likely to see action, but still someone in military service. 




 I may be the last person in recovery to have seen [*28 Days*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191754/) with Sandra Bullock, but I really liked her navigation from the bottom-drinker to someone in recovery.  It's ordinary, and as a result I liked it. 




 Good luck, /u/randoker -- you may have hit upon a strategy that's effective for you.  Not really, for the long term.   




 Welcome /u/WMWA to r/stopdrinking--I was able to stop drinking and get sober doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Why don't you see if anything there seems helpful to you in your effort--best of luck to you and your GF. 




 Why do you think that is?  Let's talk. 




 This [is the link to the post from the FAQ; What do drinking dreams mean](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) which I wrote after exchanging emails with dream researchers.   




 No problem; the title was in the original with my insertion of "Louisiana," only for clarification.  It was not my intention to editorialize. 




 I remember this well, a_o, I was at the event earlier in the day and, of course, I have coffee near there every morning.  But more significant to me was that a guy I know in AA was the first responder on the scene.  He opened the door of the drunk driver's car after his fellow first responders attended to the dead and other injured.  He describes recoiling from the smell of alcohol and the driver in a panic asking, "Are they dead?"  

Honesty is accepting that when I drank and drove, it could have been me.  



















 Don't feel bad for Alabama, this ass-clown was impeached and then the voters re-elected him to the bench. 




 LOL!  Inauthentic dumbass pretends otherwise. 


































 Not going to happen.  Reince Preibus is not a candidate for the Profiles in Courage award. 




 Great comment, I totally agree.  One of the things that I find most offensive is this politician's successful attack on the liberty to contract, and enforce contract rights.  We would not tolerate this ransacking of the Rule of Law in a close foreign ally, but many applaud Walker as the second coming?! 



















 I wrote this [post on Drinking Dreams after exchanging emails with leading dream researchers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)  There's good news for recovery in this post.   









 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; honestly! 




 Perfect! 




 Ha, Ha, well-done, KJ!   




 That's not my experience.   




 In AA I was able to drop the mask. 




 As an active AA, within the fellowship just one dishonest predator can devastate a recovery community and drive out newcomers like crazy.  How can you spot this sort of character?  And what might you do to protect yourself?   For one thing, newcomers should be wary of too private a contact.  Solid supportive relationships form in the OPEN.  When someone sounds too good to be true; they probably are.  Remember, in recovery we are all drunks and addicts, so someone presenting as totally together isn't.  Other ideas? 




 Best wishes, /u/comiju on day one!  [At this link is the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is a post I wrote about some simple "next" actions to getting and staying sober. 




 I WAS a liar.  I did not really appreciate it at the time.  I thought I was an honest person.  In reality I lied to achieve and gather to myself that which I valued.  I lied to manage how I was perceived.  Before I got sober and even for sometime after I got sober, I was a reflexive liar.  I have described how in March of 1986 I drunkenly fell down sustaining a quadriceps injury that required that my leg be placed in air cast.  This injury began my long effort to get and stay sober.  Remarkably every time I was asked about how I injured myself I told a different story.  Sometimes two irreconcilable versions to the same person.  During that same period, an administrative hearing officer told me that I had developed the unfortunate reputation for being not a serious or credible person.  That was my rock bottom.  But even after I stopped drinking the struggle to get honest and be honest was a real struggle, but as I learned ESSENTIAL to getting sober.  Ralph Waldop Emerson gave the following advice: "Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.   I call this getting molecularly honest.  And the person I needed to get honest with most in the world is ME.  Over the years and through my actions, only--I think I have been able to change the way the people who I most care about in the world see me.  I believe that today, I am perceived to be honest and trustworthy.  This has been a long haul, but it is the character asset that is most valuable to me in the world.  It is a gift of sobriety.

The simple step of a courageous individual is not to take part in the lie. One word of truth outweighs the world. --Alexandr Solzenitsyn

 




 I propose that in addition to all of our normal posts, comments, advice, and sobriety (and life)-threatening issues--that we think and talk about HONESTY.  Especially about how getting honest was prerequisite to getting sober and getting to quality sobriety.   




 I challenge you to raise your hand and "re-introduce" yourself. 




 Welcome /u/bagaiste to r/stopdrinking.  This is a great and supportive community.  I like to share the [Baby Steps post with](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) the newcomers as a place to look for "next" things to do as you get sober.  If anything resonates there for you, terrific.  Best of luck.

 Good for you.  Keep doing what you're doing. 




 I'm sitting here at my computer sipping my homemade iced tea--happily chatting on SD.  I am not going to drink TODAY. 




 It is said that alcohol is but a symptom or our "disease."  Personally, that was true for me, but amazingly after I undertook to stop drinking (which I did via [the things I describe at the Baby Steps post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) my underlying mental health issues were much improved.  In other words I was able to ACT MY WAY INTO better mental health.  Bill Wilson, one of the co-founders of AA describes in the book, Alcoholics Anonymous aka the Big Book that he had access to the leading mental health and addiction specialists of the day (1920s-1930s) and that self knowledge did not keep him sober.  So, /u/MenstrualJackson, we are not alone.  

Good luck to you. 




 How can I hate myself and yet be obsessed with how I appear to others?   How can I want to destroy myself but spend a fortune for custom tailored suits and shirts?  I do these things BECAUSE I am not honest.  I am not honest because I am afraid of rejection, pain, and further diminishment. 




 Ooooh good one.  So true, too.  

If I am to get sober, and stay sober I need to honestly see the man in the mirror for who I am.  Sometimes I am weak, sometimes strong; often vulnerable and fearful; but, trying one day at a time to be more and more accepting of what is real, rejecting my fantasy thinking and embracing life on life's terms.   




 I can't think of why not.  AA is not a monolithic society.  AA is made up of people like you and me. 









 Good for you, and welcome.   




 I'll never give up hope double-D.  You DO have it in you.  Action, my friend.   




 Then by that standard Hilary and Bill Clinton must be Gods in real life, because Maureen Dowd. 




 Congratulations, u/mossboss.  An invite to /r/dinos will shortly follow in your inbox unless Slip or one of the other DINO mods beat me to it. 




 It's not on the bestsellers list because its not a bestseller. 




 Thanks for being an important part of the whole. 




 You obviously don't read the NYT opinion section.  Setting aside the constant stream of conservative free lance contributors and conservative office holders the NYT is where William Safire went after his time as Nixon speech writer; where David Brooks, and Ross Douthat have permanent columns.  You right wing types really need to drop the whole resentment-trope, it's unbecoming. 




 Your comment made a vague and meaningless point that purported to refute the well-reasoned essay of a Southern journalist and historian--your comment was nonsense.    




 [Howell Raines is a journalist from the deep south.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howell_Raines)  He worked as a journalist at the Birmingham Post, the Atlanta Journal Constitution, and the St. Petersburg Times. He wrote an oral history of the Civil Rights movement and a history of the deep South.  I suspect he might have slightly more insight into the politics and history of the South than your average NYT reporter. 




 Forty-two days and depressed?  This in my experience is totally normal, because it takes time to recover from the assault on the body, brain and central nervous system that we were doing with alcohol in the period (years?) before we stopped.  I guarantee that give it some time and you will feel so much better.  If the mood does not lift, please by all means don't drink and see a licensed professional. 




 While you technically are correct about the remaining southern democratic holdouts--[Howell Raines is correct and you don't know what you are talking about.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) 














 This is a brilliant essay by Howell Raines. 














 This is a powerful post that gets at several core issues that I was speaking to someone about early, early this morning and over the past few days.  In my opinion we struggle with "honesty" or what AA calls the necessary prerequisite to sobriety: rigorous honesty--because, we want to "appear to be" smart, funny, attractive, and powerful when deep down we believe we aren't or we suspect we are fraudulent.  A personality distortion that can result from this struggle is narcissism--which is an obsessive, dishonest stage management of how we are perceived.  It's not uncommon to see people in recovery who are incredibly, even reflexively dishonest, and I suspect this also stems from not being comfortable in being in "their own skin."  I was one of these people, too.  

I had to learn to be vulnerable, honest, what I came to call--molecularly honest.  That extends to EVERYTHING I say on /r/stopdrinking and frankly all the Reddit forums.  If I am to grow up, I need to embrace honestly, who I am.

So while you felt bad, and vulnerable, /u/Englishfella -- I applaud your honesty and I am gilding you as a power of example.  Keep doing what you're doing and the next time you see your friend with the 14 years--go up to him and stick your hand out.  Congratulate him on his 14 years.  I suspect that if you can hang on to what you got, we will be celebrating you and looking to you for more wisdom. 




 Welcome to r/stopdrinking--I'm on my iPhone so I  can't share the babysteps post with you but I will update a little later.  I  wanted to say that you are in the right place to get support for a SOBER journey. 

[The Baby Steps are what I did to stop drinking and get sober.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you. 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; free time? Someone has free time?!! 




 Hey, /u/divebarprincess -- I thought I shared the [Baby Steps post with you previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) but it sounds to me like you really need to talk to a licensed professional and not well-meaning but anonymous redditors.  Please keep us updated on how you're doing. 




 Nice! And we reached a place of indifference to alcohol.  It is not in my movie. 




 Wow, no kidding.  You look great.  Congratulations! 




 This was totally on-topic; relating to both corruption at the highest levels and the impact on local, state and national politics.  The article was by the pre-eminent Virginia political reporter and it further pertained to what "honest services" constitutes in the view of the federal courts. 




 One of my SD pals logs on here, periodically to itemize where he's at in terms of booze not consumed and money saved.   At last count he was closing in on a year and the totals are mind-blowing.  Trust me, he saved ten times the amount you poured down the drain last night.  In other words you aren't "down" anything.   




 Congratulations, /u/saltwatermonkey. 




 Not small at all; that's real life and if you don't pick up the next drink you have a chance a whole new and authentic life. 




 Check the pic--all the donors lined up to give "Hedge" a check. 



















 I think Rubio has more than once disqualified himself for higher office.  This is one more example. 




 The [ethical rules](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/mrpc/mcpr.authcheckdam.pdf) that apply to all lawyers tell us that all persons deserve competent and professional representation (the rules adopted in most states used to say zealous representation, but that idea justified unacceptable distortions in professional conduct). The rules also remind professionals that just because a matter involves repugnant or controversial allegations, that in and of itself does not justify declining to represent a client.  Remember if a person comes into an emergency room with gunshot wounds received in the commission of a crime, an emergency room provider won't decline medical services, right?  Having undertaken a representation, competent and professional lawyers pursue every defense, challenging everything from jurisdiction (the power to render judgment in a matter), investigation into facts, challenges based on the law applicable to the facts--so as to hold the prosecution to EVERY element of the government's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is not the job of the lawyer to judge a client--the people, the finders of fact and of law will do that.  The lawyer is ultimately just one of the advocates in an imperfect system of justice. 









 It was never one glass for me either.  In fact, when I was drinking I would deliberately avoid just one drink because of how uncomfortable and miserable I would feel.  I was a PIG drinker who once I started would not stop until I was in a stupor. 




 Yeah, this is a common issue.  I think it was /u/offtherocks who said, mark-off the first two weeks on your calendar for a bumpy ride. 



















 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I am keeping a beautiful, sunny Saturday in Cleveland SOBER.  

Than you, /u/McLensky for a great week of daily check-ins for SD World.  Service work can be a great step in the SOBER Journey. 




 Yay, congrats, KJ!  Well-deserved, my friend. 




 Good news!  I am so happy for you.  Naughty kitten! 




 AA meetings helped me through this sort of quandary about what to do.  Especially when I was in new surroundings.  There I found people who understand me.  Especially other Irish binge drinkers. 




 In addition to the excellent advice of my pal, /u/juden-shikker -- I found an attitude of ALL-IN made a lot of difference.  Let me add one more observation: persistence, one more day, one more day...and, then the miracle occurred for me.   




 Nice!  Action not words is the path to sobriety in my experience--and, fitness is action. 




 Welcome /u/fabiolives to /r/stopdrinking -- let me share the [link to the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is my answer to the question: what do I do next?  Obviously, following your doctor's advice is huge and very smart.  Good luck to you. 




 At supper an hour ago, I said essentially these words to my wife.  In fact add the fact that I am a white guy born in the deep south, you get no argument from me that this flag is an offense to my black brothers and sisters.  As flawed as I am personally, that flag should no longer be officially in the face of black Americans. 




 What worked for me in terms of stopping drinking wasn't fear of liver failure or wet brain--instead, being sick and tired all the time and hoping, knowing if I stopped that I could turn my life around.  In other words it wasn't death--it was the certainty that there is life.  I stopped drinking and I got sober by doing [the simple things I describe at this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you. 




 I found all the support I needed and more, in AA meetings. 




 The [least popular advice in early sobriety is dry people, dry places.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/?ref=search_posts) 




 Here's what I did: [the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  And like you I recognized that my drinking was endangering not only my health but putting my children at risk (mine from driving impaired with them in the back seat of my car.)  I had to take ACTION.   




 I love AA and I avidly work an AA program, but I agree you hear a lot of stupid shit in AA meetings sometimes.  I try not to judge, but I'd like to think that I've reached a point where I developed some discernment between substance and utter bollocks.   Remember even with substantial time sober, these are many of the same drunk clowns who made sitting on a barstool insufferable.  As Slip likes to point out, some are sicker than others. 




 Personally, I would be going to /r/alanon meetings to learn some coping strategies with my brother's alcoholism.  A lot of us in recovery are "double winners" so to speak; and it looks like you might be one too.  The other thing is I would have to look long and hard--as you are doing--with what you thought you were doing with the cans of beer.  Remember anger and resentment are the chief offenders for relapse.  Good on you for posting about this; because I've been there and all I needed was one good excuse and I spent 7 years in relapse hell.  Don't go there, it's not worth it.  Most of us don't make it back.

 I'm really happy for you.  Yeah, my home group, a large commuter AA meeting was laughing with me when I said that I too didn't want to be a member of this AA Cult.  For 22 of the last 29 years the AA sober life boat and path has  been saving my life and giving me a path to discovering my authentic self.

 This is politics in action, in the most dramatic sense.  All politics are local. 




 Alcoholism, or an alcohol disorder, or an alcohol addiction is more than a bad habit, or a bad choice according to medical and mental health professionals.  For many alcoholics if not most it is an intractable disease resulting in misery and premature death--so it is DAMN HARD to quit drinking or to stay stopped on will power alone.  What to do?

I did the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It may sound like semantics, but I never "quit drinking."  Instead I make a daily decision not to drink TODAY, only--no matter what happens good or bad.  I tough out the tough hours.  I doggedly persist for one day.  One Day.  Then I do it again.  Amazingly, it get's easier--after the first tough days, and the first couple of bumpy weeks as long as I don't pick up the next drink.  Key to my success was throwing myself head first into recovery.  All-in.  A real commitment.  

That my friend is my best recommendation for trying again.  Make a decision, go all-in, doggedly persist, repeat.

Good luck. 





























 I feel bad that you felt that way; and as a long time AA and the OP  of the [Big Book Study Group](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=big+book+study+group restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all) you wandered into the reading of the most insane and sexist  chapter in the Big Book, in my opinion.  




 I don't disagree with this.  I think he's a little nuts having heard him extemporize and call a Ohio State Trooper, a jerk because the officer  pulled him over for speeding.  But he is competent and way-too-sane by GOP standards. 




 I believe you are correct. 




 In the famous words of George H.W., that's "the brown one."  














 We are talking about why the POTUS should have continuous "security" 24/7 versus the Ohio taxpayers paying for security for a governor who ran for a full term fully intending to become a part-timer on the taxpayer's dime when he ran for President.  If that's illogical to you, then you might consider a refresher course on logic, maybe somewhere other than a home school, this time.
 




 [At this link.](https://www.animallaw.info/statute/tn-good-samaritan-dogs-cars) 




 Good for you.  It may well be that AA didn't work for you, because you when you went "you had one foot out the door" so to speak.  For me, being ALL-IN made all the difference. 




 The difference is that the POTUS travels with redundant offices, communications, and staff to remain in continuous contact with the levers of his office: e.g. Air Force One.  

Name-calling because you disagree is childish.   




 Kasich is hardly governor 24/7 when he is running around the country running for POTUS.   




 Here's how I would see that based on years sober:  we can not foresee the future.  In recovery, I've seen all sorts of families form, families of affiliation, new families, and recovery families.  But newly sober, and in pain and regret we can't imagine feeling OK again, free, and happy.  I've seen with my own eyes, miracles in recovery.
