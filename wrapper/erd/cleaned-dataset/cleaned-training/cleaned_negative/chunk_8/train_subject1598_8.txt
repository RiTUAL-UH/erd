 (thanks to the person who noted my original title got East and West wrong ... oops) 



















 **Where I am now**
London (any airport)

**Dates**
Around 8th - 21st December, will adjust dates for cheaper flights if necessary

**Interests**
Cities and culture. I am going along so I am looking for somewhere that an English speaking Western traveller can easily meet up with people to travel bits of the journey with. Needs to be safe enough to travel alone, I have travelled before, but always with friends previously. Need to be able to go to several cities or places over a couple of weeks. I intend to backpack the journey (so hostels over hotels).

**Weather**
Hot (18 - 30C)

**Budget**
1500 for two weeks including flights

**Visa**
I'm a UK resident, and I need somewhere I can either get a visa at short notice, or don't need a visa.  









 We'd have preferred "Jolly good show" 









 Just watch a summary of current world news 




 Washing up 









 When 9/11 happened, some people chose to burn to death, but around 200 people chose to jump - knowing they would die. 

People who choose euthanasia make a similar choice - a quick death vs a long slow painful death from disease.

I understand why people chose to jump in 9/11, I understand why people choose to die with dignity in a hospital - I think euthanasia should be legalised. 




 Go to the press 




 They're individually asking 173 countries if they'll accept you on principle 




 Yes, technically true. 



















 Given that approximately 40% of the world population has internet access, I would be a lot more careful about making guarantees. 









  Anyone know what we did to change from 1929

We  had the Great Depression and lots and lots of people went bankrupt....

 It's a competition my cousin is in - so if you can "like" it - she and I would be very happy. 




 and no services? 




 Read the article - we're not there yet.

Dr Rob Buckle, head of regenerative medicine at the MRC, said: 

"This research is an exciting *early* step towards that goal, and a convincing demonstration of the potential power of direct reprogramming technology, by which once cell type is converted to another. However, much more work will be needed before this process can be reproduced in the lab environment, and in a safe and tightly controlled way suitable for use in humans." 




 Yes, we have the first stage of growing organs - there will be a lot of animal research before that gets anywhere near a person. They still need to get over transplant rejection, getting organs to proper size (among other issues). Your suggestion that we were already at a stage where this was a usable technology was nonsense. 




 What planet are you on?!

"We can now grow new organs with stem cells"
No, no we can't!! 




 Why doesn't the future require liver or kidney damage studies? Are people who suffer organ failure worth less in your opinion? 




 It depend which minorities. If you look at those who arrived recently - such as Romanians, Bulgarians etc, then yes, they are doing worse - there is a lot of prejudice in our system.

The Indians, the Poles, the Chinese, are all doing pretty well in our system these days. 

The group that tends to come closest to the bottom is white working class British - draw what conclusions you want from that 




 Well the LD50 is rarely used - it's not a particularly useful test - I mean any dosage that kills half a group of mice is clearly too high (when weight adjusted) for humans. 

There is a lot more to animal research than toxicology - most of it is about understanding the processes going on. So, for the macular degenration I expect there were a lot of studies working out which stem cells were key to the formation of the eye, and what effect they have when implanted into an adult eye etc. 




 Stem cell treatments are developed using animal studies. So the recent stem cell treatment for age related macular degeneration was only possible because of knowledge derived from mouse and primate tests.

 Three blinks will be an error code by the manufacturer to say what precisely is wrong, but I can't find the blink-error list for that model of TV. For example, are you sure it's the power board? 









 Putting url's or search terms in the address bar doesn't do anything. I am having the use the Google Search bar on the right to search for websites. 

Reinstalling Firefox did not solve the issue.

Windows 7. 64-bit.  




 Can you explain more - where is that, how do I fix it? Is that what three blinks means? 




 I have a Panasonic TX-P50G10B, the red power light is blinking 3 times intermittently and the TV will not turn on
 




 Houston, I'm going to detonate..... farewell. 




 I tip my hat, and you tip your wallet. The deal is done.

 I graduated from Oxford Uni seven years ago. A few thoughts.

First off. There are great minds everywhere, from the top uni to the bottom, and many great minds that never went at all. That said, you are likely to find that Harvard/Oxford(etc) have a high proportion of very clever people than at lower ranked universities. 

You will find great tutors at all universities. I will go one step further and say that Harvard/Oxford does not necessarily have the best tutors/lecturers. Whereas as a small American liberal arts college may hire a professor for their teaching abilities, top universities tend to hire great academics (those who excel in their field), and top academics do not necessarily make great tutors and lecturers. In my time at Oxford I had great and terrible lecturers. Of my two best tutors, one was a DPhil student (the other was Prof Mayhew). 

Comparing my experience with friends, the major differences between my university and some "lower ranked" universities was:

- Workload: I was expected to read up for, and write, two x 2000 word essays per week. The reading list would be 8-20 books/papers for each. In fact, learning to read quickly and effectively is the single biggest skill I took away from Oxford. One consequence is people cover a lot of ground very fast. One third of my first year was economics, yet I covered more economic theory in my first year than some friends at other universities did in their first year.

- Connections: I met a lot of very driven people, many of whom are on the path to becoming very successful. The contacts I made at Oxford will last a lifetime. The "Oxford" name obviously helps - many employers, rightly or wrongly, would prefer to hire an Oxbridge graduate over (probably equally able) other people.

- Great minds: The tutorial system at Oxford - whereby two people are grilled by each other and a professor each week for an hour - sharpens your mind. It makes you able to vocalise your thoughts concisely and confidently. You are constantly challenged by people who are as smart or smarter.  









 It's contagious... 




 Russia and America are very different places. 

Russia is much more autocratic (see democracy index), has lower standards of living (about half the GDP/Person (PPP), is more corrupt (US ranked 19th best, Russia ranked 127th).

Much less media freedom, more repressive laws (consider that in Russia promoting a gay agenda is a crime) .... there are many differences. 




 It's going to be a faff if we need to use 5 digits, maybe we can reset every 10,000 years 














 Was in science communication. Became a maths/economics teacher for 3 years. Returned to science communication after.

No regrets. 




 Can someone clarify. Are the nasal ensheathing cells a form of stem cell? 














 Great to see the background studies that made this possible 









 It's not a better or worse training programme, it's a different approach. What it does do, is get people who may not have considered teaching, into the profession, a proportion of whom stay on for years. 

Remember that "traditional" routes into teaching have similar high drop out rates over the first 3 years of teaching. 




 Most first year teachers don't know how to manage behaviour - TFA or otherwise. My experience in the UK suggests to me that after the first year (where PGCE students have done some teaching and learning, and Teach First (UK version of TFA) have done a year teaching on their own) the Teach First'ers were a lot better equipped to deal with behaviour. 




 While some of the UK academies have failed, they have generally outperformed non-academies, and certainly turned round many under performing schools. There are issues with academies, but I wouldn't call the whole programme a failure. 




 Current set up:

Sherwood RD-6106R 5.1 amp
2 x Eltax Symphony 6.2 speakers
2 x Eltax HT-2 Bipolar Rear Speakers
Eltax Symphony Centre Center

Picked up everything second hand. So want to know what type of "stats" i need out of a sub - I know nothing about this.

Budget - up to 60 second hand. (I've picked up everything else for about 150 altogether)

 I'm torn by this too. Also considering the Nexus 




 The book is "The Organization Man" - but I haven't read it (yet).

The books are only be stacked temporarily. Half of them have already been put up on the first bookshelf now. I think it'll be ok on the spines provided you don't put large heavy books on small light ones. 




 Would this technique be applicable to pets? 














 In the UK over 98% of animals used are mice, rats, birds and fish (mostly mice). Across the EU this figure is closer to 93%.

Estimates for the US around 95% are probably about right

 We do see you as having an accent, but we also see people in different areas of the UK as having an accent.  




 The talkpage of the Pitcairn Islands has a discussion on whether it would be easier to individually name everyone who lives there. 




 Oh dear lord, this is going to get messy..... 









 And then Steam isn't recognising all the files in the new folder and is downloading them all over again 




 Can't add a folder which is not empty 




 All my games ARE on a separate hard drive. But they all get installed initially to the SSD and then moved off to a second drive using steamtool. 

FFXIII was different because the installation appears to require about 80GB (even though the game is only 60GB), which is more than I have spare on the SSD.  




 I have FFXIII on the G:\ with a SteamTool link pointing at it from my C:\ steamapps\common game directory (as with all my games).

Normally If I then "installed" a game that was there it would find the game and not feel the need to reinstall, but instead it's trying to redownload the entire 50GB game. 

I know the game is working as I can play it by using the launcher in its current location, but Steam library thinks it is uninstalled. 




 I have enough disk space to download FFXIII (with about 10GB to spare - it's a small SSD).

When I finish, I plan to use SteamTool to move it to another drive where all my other games are:

BUT

Steam is creating a 20GB "downloading" folder in addition to the 43GB it's downloaded so far (of 49.4GB of the game). Which is taking me over my available space. 

Help! 














 Great to see a British scientist win the Nobel Prize!
