 Look at the base of his thumb and you see bad bruising, add the bandage down the arm and would say he has an injury so pointless taking him to America when he wont play so let him stay at home and work on fitness 




 Cole vs Antonio Valencia though wasn't for some reason 




 Individual awards like team of the year are a load of shite, David Luiz got in world team of the year. He is brilliant though and will be remembered as one the greatest England has ever produced  




 That was good old dithering Dave thinking he wasn't strong enough for the league in the end

Can you also show me where he said it was a done deal? 




 Ronaldo 




 Trust me schweinsteiger is absolutely amazing and I genuinely still can't believe it but think it will be bigger than him  




 We will go for one massive thing which if it comes off would be huge 




 What do you mean wasn't going to be on the books this year? As in if we hadn't got him we wouldn't have spent the money, correct but we did so us now not spending the money is us saving it 




 Hahahahahahaha  




 Hahahahahahaha 




 Stopping us wasting money as you put it is still saving money as it is expenditure we aren't now using, before falcao came we lost vida, Ferdinand and evra who probably earned that amount so his wage was just money we had spent anyway so all in all yeh we are saving money. 




 I work at Manchester royal hospital and we generally use purple and clear bags for bloods, but the guy could literally have just grabbed a bag and used it 




 Yeh because he's saved us another 250 grand a week wages you weird bell, so he was shit it happens but with him, RVP and Nani gone that about 600 grand a week saved 




 Add falcaos wages to that as well... 




 The article is a load of shit, apparently he told all this to a Milan fan who met him at Wimbledon who remembered everything fergie said perfectly and then told tuttosport 




 We would not take a 20 million hit after one season, not a chance 




 I've read a lot of shit in my life, but this right here is the fucking biggest steaming pile I've ever had the displeasure of letting my eyes witness. Day can only get better I suppose 




 It's a midfield 3
