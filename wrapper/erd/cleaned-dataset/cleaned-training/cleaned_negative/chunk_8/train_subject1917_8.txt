 The title is what got me, I think. This bill would not stop spying on Americans. It would just make it harder for them to use company dbs for their spying. They still have many other tools to use. I apologize if I came off a little brash.  




 I agree! I believe when we build support for incremental bills like this we should always continue to inform people that the fight is not over. That this is not the cure. That there is still much to do. I just know once this bill gets passed you will hear things like, "They just passed that bill that requires the gov to have a warrant to collect your data. We won!" and that would be far from reality. So, when discussing bills like this we must fight for their passage but also press the fact that this is not over. We would still have many mtns to climb. Defense of the Constitution is a constant battle. Its under attack from all sides, every day.  




 I agree it would be a move in the right direction but would passing this bill close the door on discussions of the gov still collecting data? I am afraid people will take this bill as, "They no longer collect our data." Which would be false. This could lead to the discussion losing steam and nothing ever being done about the gov collection. They do not need company DBs to collect your data. So, what is stopping that? 




 IF that is what they are saying then it would be a good thing. But what about the US Government collecting information in their own DBs without a warrant? Would that still be in effect? 




 Reps. Ted Poe (R-TX, 2nd), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA, 19th), and Thomas Massie (R-KY, 4th) said in a statement Wednesday that the bill -- the End Warrantless Surveillance of Americans Act -- would force the government to get a warrant before it can access **databases** containing American data.

This statement worries me. Does this mean they can still collect the data but can only access it if they have a warrant? That would still mean there are large DBs with all of your communications stored in them. How would this DB be protected? What kind of safeguards would be in place to prevent malicious intent? 

I would prefer them not to store any data on Americans unless a warrant has been issued.

 I was with you until your last sentence. Rands record speaks for itself on this issue. He has been fighting illegal NSA activities for some time now. 




 Paul sued the NSA for their illegal activities. He has also co-sponsored legislation to end it. Saying he is only coming out with this stance for the election is completely false. 




 Blaming Paul for Obamas broken promises? 




 So, are you blaming Rand for Obamas broken promises? 




 He has sued the NSA for their illegal activities. He has co-sponsored legislation to end their illegal activities.

 Is that why the larger our government becomes the more influenced by the elite it is? Its larger now than at any time in our history and is more influence now than at any time in our history. The smaller it is the easier it is to hold accountable. State rights and small federal government. Harder to defend the people? Do you know how many domestic federal police agencies there are? lol  




 The larger the government is the more impossible it becomes to hold accountable.

 His actions like suing the NSA or attempting to pass legislation to end its overreach? Those actions? 




 Fry the little shit. 




 I stand with Rand. 




 Except for the fact that Rand has sued the NSA for what they are doing. Has tried to pass legislation to end it. Obama has done nothing but say things.  




 But Paul has actually sued the NSA for what they are doing. He is trying to fight them. Something Obama never did.

  "One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line." - President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998.    

 "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program." - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998.    

 "Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." - Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998.    

 "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998    

 "[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998.    

 "Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." - Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998.    

 "Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies." - Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999.    

 "There is no doubt that . Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." - Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, Dec, 5, 2001.    

 "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them." - Sen. Carl Levin (d, MI), Sept. 19, 2002.    

 "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power." - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.    

 "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is using and developing weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002.    

 "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons." - Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002.    

 "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force  if necessary  to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002.    

 "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . We also should remember we have alway s underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002    

 "He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do." - Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002.    

 "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002    

 "We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. "[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. And now he has continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003.

 The only solution is raising taxes and increasing the size of government. 




 "I would say it is the most secretive White House that I have ever been involved in covering, and that includes  I spent 22 years of my career in Washington and covered presidents from President Reagan on up through now, and I was Washington bureau chief of the Times during George W. Bush's first term, I dealt directly with the Bush White House when they had concerns that stories we were about to run put the national security under threat. But, you know, they were not pursuing criminal leak investigations," she continued. "The Obama administration has had seven criminal leak investigations. That is more than twice the number of any previous administration in our history. It's on a scale never seen before. This is the most secretive White House that, at least as a journalist, I have ever dealt with." - Former New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson, January 2014

 How, exactly, do you gerrymander the Senate? 




 Burping and farting while zipping up my pants after a long alcohol induced piss. 




 Boot the computer and when you see the Dell splash/bios screen immediately start pressing Ctrl+F11.

So, I am assuming that this disc from your friend was not a Dell OEM disk. Probably a retail copy.

Is there a Windows license sticker on the bottom of your laptop? Check under the battery, as well. Key retrievers will not give you the correct key on OEM installs, FME. Try to find that license sticker. If you find the correct key we may be able to use the retail copy of the DVD.

Try calling Dell support and requesting a reinstallation DVD. They *were* allowing 1 per customer but I am not sure how old your system is or if they are still doing this for Win7 machines.

If Dell will not ship you the DVD try locating a Dell Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit DVD. Ask your friends and family. If you can get your hands on this DVD it *should not* ask you for a key. 




 Do not use your friends key. You have a key, correct?

A few questions:    

What version of Windows was installed on the laptop when purchased? Windows 7 Home Premium? 32bit or 64bit?    

What version of Windows is your product key for?    

How did you restore it? What procedure did you use?    

Have you tried Ctrl+F11 just to make sure the recovery partition is no longer there? 




 Have you tried Dells built-in system recovery? Ctrl+F11 at boot. Of course, if you wiped the drive, including the recovery partition, during a clean install this will not work. Also, do you have a Dell OEM Windows 7 Home Premium DVD or know someone that has one?
    
    
**TO ANYONE READING THIS:**    
*If you purchase a new computer, please take a moment and create the recovery discs on first boot of a new system. Most manufacturers come with pre-loaded software and a recovery partition to create these discs.*

 /r/Murica would like a word with you, fellow patriot. 




 lol ditto 









 And here you are bringing absolutely nothing to the table but a rant about comments. 

Thanks for your input.  




 haha, I have never met a Christian that has said anything of the sort. Not saying they do not exist but I live in the bible belt. Grew up southern baptist. The major reason I see or hear is confusion. Older people like things simple. On one side you have people saying its bad for you. On the other side its the cure for all things. Then you have the government that classifies it as harmful as heroin. Now you have to understand that majority of these elderly people have probably never tried marijuana. They only know that the US government says its as bad as heroin and that the news tells them that people who smoke pot are potheads and lazy. These elderly probably grew up during the aftermath of the Reefer Madness days. Then you had the 60s anti war demonstrators and the hippies who were portrayed as anarchists, murders, soldier haters. etc. In my experience, religion is the least reason people in the bible belt are anti legalization. With all that said, where do the majority of elderly retire? The south....the Bible belt. So its a catch all for the elderly who in turn has anti marijuana views because of the way its been portrayed to them the last 70-80 years. Some people will vote against on religious grounds. The majority? Not so much.  




 I am a bible thumper and I support legalization. I know many bible thumpers with similar views as mine. You know, it could be elderly people that have been manipulated their entire life by US government propaganda against Marijuana that is keeping it from happening. No religion required.

 In one hand I have a raging [Freedom boner](http://i.imgur.com/GhzjoRT.jpg) and with the other hand I am wiping away [Freedom tears of pride](http://i.imgur.com/9GYM4bv.gifv). That was beautiful. Thank you, /u/gaping_your_mother, for your words of Freedom. Thank you, /u/Ninjarabies, for sharing it with us.  




 Well, Britain was obligated to defend neutral Belgium by the terms of a 75-year old treaty in WW1. The US had no obligation. Probably should have tried a little harder to keep your region in-check. Britain, well Europe in general, always seems to wait until it hits the fan to actually do anything and when they finally do something its sub-par at best. Look at the Balkans in the 90s. Europe sat around while millions of people died. Who finally did something about it? The US Military.
