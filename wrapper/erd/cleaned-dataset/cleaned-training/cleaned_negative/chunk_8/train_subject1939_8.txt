 Yes. Writing, music and film get screwed here. Maybe writing most of all, since live music and theater going is popular but no one wants to pay for live readings 




 I specified rich American pirates as being hypocritical, I didn't claim that all pirates were rich or American.  









 Yes it is "being a dick," but social pressure and cultural norms ALLOW them to be dicks. 

When you are desperate artist who sees no way of making any money off your art except getting Taylor Swift level huge, you'll jump at every opportunity. When our culture---see this thread!--says artists are greedy jerks if they don't give everything away for free, then it makes it far easier to McDonald's to leech off artists without anyone caring. 

This stuff doesn't happen in a vacuum.  




 Maybe doctors weren't the best examples, as many are really rich. I can even understand complaining about really rich artists. But in this thread and elsewhere you see so much hate towards artists who just want like poverty wage salary from their art.  




 You don't think the devaluation of art and the constant refrain that all artists should do things for free and any money is just icing on top they should never ask contributes?  




 You need electricity and an internet access to pirate too, so I'm not really sure what you are arguing?  




 As an artist yourself you are free to make your work free!

I mean most authors publish fiction free online or write essays that are free to read. Most musicians put some songs online.  




 Not sure how to feel about this. There is way too much bullshit in Amazon reviews, with many bought and paid for. OTOH, any author who is in the community has hundreds if not thousands of Facebook friends and twitter followers who they don't really know.  




 More like: 

What about poor people? Do they just not get to make art? Only rich people would make art, people who can afford to work for free? 

(But to answer your actual question: TV is free, YouTube is free, many museums are free, public domain books are free, libraries are free, etc. There is tons of free art in the world, more than you could ever consume in your life.)
 




  I don't think that people will stop creating art simply because they're not getting paid. 

Totally disagree with you. 

1) There are a lot of people who will always do art, but will do MUCH less of it if they don't have enough money to live off it. People white about George R. R. Martin taking years to finish a book... imagine how long it would take if he worked 50 hours a week at a desk job!

2) Anyone who works in a  creative industry for more than a decade can tell you tons of talented people give up and quit because they can't make money. It's not like those people say "waaaah! no one is buying my work so I'm going to quit to spite them!" But rather, they make no money but still have bills to pay so they work a full time job. They get promoted, they have kids, they live a life. They don't have time to make art for free with all of life's other responsibilities. 

 




  But from what I've read the corporations cause far more damage to an artist than the pirates do.

I agree with a lot of what you said, but to me the piracy and free-content movement has totally empowered corporations. Nowadays, huge corporate bands expect to get art for free! There are like weekly stories about McDonald's hosting a showcase at SXSW and asking bands to play for free, or Showtime doing "crowd sourced" artwork contests where they get stuff for free. 

Corporations LOVE the idea that they don't have to pay artists. 

I mean, you daily read articles from working musicians and authors about how impossible it is to have a regular income from art anymore, yet Exxon, Coke, Nike and the rest are doing fine.  




 These are just empty platitudes though. The reality on the ground is that it's nearly impossible to get paid anymore. It's much harder to be a middle class musician/novelist/whatever than it was 20 years ago. 

 




  You can't stop piracy.

I hate to break it to you dude but... you can't stop any crimes entirely. We've been trying to stop murder for centuries and it happens every day! People will always steal, kill, speed, pirate, and anything else you can think of. 

But it is probably possible to decrease crime. 

 So let me ask you, as an artist. Would you rather have more people see (and enjoy) your work but you don't get paid anymore? Or have them not see it at all, and you don't get paid?

Honestly? I think this is a false question. Here's how real life works: people have bills to pay. They have things they want to buy. They have children to raise and so on and so forth. If artists don't get paid, they have to work more--unless they are born rich. This means they have less time to work on their art, or else they change their art to fit the mass commercial market. 

So either society has to figure out how to pay artists, or else only the rich and amateurs will ever make art.  




  There may be more to it than just this simple equation. It's easy to say an album or a film got 10,000 illegal downloads, but how many of the people downloading watched/listened? 

Look, I understand piracy. I understand people download more stuff than they consume AND more than they would buy if piracy didn't exist. 

BUT it is also true that many people pirate stuff they would buy otherwise. Trust me, I'm old enough to remember when everyone went from buying a couple CDs a month to buying zero a month when Napster and everything else broke out. 

 We've had a long time where the paradigm for access to works of art is a 'gatekeeper' model - you pay and you take your chances as to whether or not you'll like it (based on reviews, single releases, etc). How many of us have gone to see a film and wished we could get our money back, or even the time back that it took to watch it?

Welcome to everything in life though!

How many times have you eaten a meal that wasn't that good? Or seen a movie that you ended up not liking? Or gone bowling and ended up not enjoying it? 

Why should artists be the only ones not paid though? Why don't you ask for money back when you realize you weren't as hungry as you thought you were? Or ask for a refund from an airline if your vacation is shitty?  









  ...but those two are not representative of the core of piracy.

Yep, totally agree. I hate how rich white American pirates with lots of disposable income will act like the fact that there are starving people in other parts of the world who can't afford books means that everyone should be able to pirate.  




  People want food stamps and a basic income, which amount to free food.

I don't think that's comparable. There are not workers who aren't getting paid to provide those things. Government workers get paid. The grocery stores that use food stamps get paid. 

 People want socialized medicine, which amounts to free doctors' visits. 

Again, the doctors get paid. 

But with art, people often attack artists who get paid and say they are "greedy" and evil and stuff. I've never heard someone say a doctor is "greedy" for wanting to get enough money to live on.  




   Books, and albums are often not worth twenty bucks a go,

But do they really cost that much? A hardcover book does, but a trade paperback is more like 15 before discounts--which are frequent--and ebooks, even from big 5 publishers, seem to be more like 9.99 before discounts. 

In addition, services like Oyster give you unlimited ebooks for 9.99 a month.

Personally, I really think 10 bucks is a pretty great prize for a book or album that you can read or listen to for as many times as you want. Like, a movie ticket costs 15 bucks in a lot of places these days and that's only 2 hours of entertainment. Hell, I know people who spend 10 bucks a day on coffee who think that 10 for a book is a "rip off." I don't get that mindset.  









  The bulk of income for artists in the last 15 years has been by touring. 

I think you mean musicians, other artists (painters, writers, etc.) don't make money from touring. 

But did you read the article? It mentions that even pretty popular and famous bands like Grizzly Bear barely make any money touring. That's not really how musicians who aren't Jay Z level make money.  









 We should also recognize that it has nothing to do with art per se. People steal anything that can be stolen easily, which means anything that can be digitized: computer programs, personal data, video games, whatever. 

Point being, I think it is silly when people pretend that it's about "art should be free, maaaaan." We'd all steal cars and boats if it was as easy as pirating an album.  




  A lot of artists who work for free are not worth being paid. 

But I'm talking about artists who readers DO want to read, but don't want to pay for. For every book or film or album that sells, probably 100 pirated copies of it are downloaded. 

No one is saying that you should never write for free, or no work should ever be free.  




 Did you read the article? It talks about how really famous bands and other artists whose names are widely known and their art widely consumed can't even make a decent salary off of it. 

(Article also points out how artists gets attacked and insulted for not wanting to work for free.) 




 How does a human with any empathy get into this kind of mindset? 

 When David Byrne of Talking Heads recently declared he was pulling his catalog out of Spotify because of measly revenues from the service, and concerns about the sustainability of this distribution method for emerging artists, online commenters were less than sympathetic. Truly creative people are delighted to share their work and ideas for free, wrote one commenter. Another said, If you are only being creative as a means to get rich, then I dont want your crappy creation and I hope you go bust. 









 I think what's really galling about piracy is that there is already more free work than anyone can ever consume. The public domain stretches back to antiquity. There are libraries all over America and most countries. There is a flood of work to read published for free online every day. 

Yet despite all that, people think they are also entitled to get every single other work for free too. No one would ever think that about non-artistic fields (a right to eat at every restaurant for free, a right to get medical advice from every doctor for free, etc.)  




 And the great point is definitely true: if consumers (readers/music fans/etc.) don't support arts, yet artists still have bills to pay... they have to turn to corporations and the elites to fund them, which is never a great situation for art.  




  My view is too many artists think their self expression is valuable in, and of itself.

I think this is utter nonsense, no offense. 

What's crazy about today's deal is that people DO want work, they just don't want to pay. If no one wants to read your book, or listen to your music, you really can't complain. But if 10,000 people want to read your book or 50,000 people want to listen to your music so badly they download it illegally, but then they don't want to pay... that's really a problem. I have no problem with people wanting to ignore my work, but I do have a problem with people thinking they are entitled to get my work for free. 

It's not that self-expression is valuable in and of itself, it's that people DO find it valuable and DO want to consume it, yet don't want to pay.  














 The problem I think is that Amazon's money pile for authors is picked by them. They can make it as big or small as they want. So more people reading more books might not translate to more money for authors in the KU program.  














 I bet it will be even less 




 Weiner is just straight up bad 




 I think they totally changed their whole deal a few years ago. Like you, I remember when they were just a cheating  site or place to steal essays, but now they are an ebook lender or something  




 I've never seen this before, but the answer is that the book has been changed for some reason... likely for a younger audience (like a children's book version of a classic book) by Michael Kerr. I can't find the info on this specific adaptation though.  

















































 I assume you mean Wall Street. 














 Pretty much agree, except all the lines of dialogue (but the bones of a screenplay don't line up with novel writing) 














 Agree, the obsession with "world building" is weird. Most fiction, even SF/F stuff doesn't need that to the degree people fuss about it. Let it come naturally out of the story.  

















































 Do not do. Vast majority of books don't sell 7k, and real publishers pay you, you don't pay them 





























 Well, I don't read those authors! Or at least they aren't favorites. And if someone like Cormac McCarthy or Don DeLillo wrote a regency romance I'd have to read because it would be so absurd! 




 It certainly feels like epic fantasy in the way that Star Wars might, but I think a ton of SF reads that way so I'd still call in SF.  




 All my favorite authors I'd read no matter what genre they wrote in.  







































 Yeah but Caspar's junk was blown off. I'm sure Ray lives, probably beabag rounds, but I think Caspar was tortured with real shotgun blasts.  




 Of course! But it's kind of hard to compare different artforms IMHO. Like what does it mean to say a painting is better or worse than a song? Or that a play is better or worse than a sculpture? 

Books and movies are both narrative, so maybe more similar than those examples, but they are still very different in many ways.  




 Yeah but Ray is the main character here, both from like the amount of screentime and how the show was marketed.  




 It would be pretty cheap for him not to be dead... but he's also clearly not dead. No show has the balls to kill their star played by the biggest actor in episode 2. 

Game of Thrones was crazy shocking to do it at the end of the season, but no one is going to do it at the start.  




 Nice, yeah I think there is a TON of crossover between SF, fantasy, and horror (and even mystery... Stephen King just won an Edgar.) 

What I wonder is how many crossover awards there are between literary awards (pulitzer, NBA, booker, etc.) and the genre ones 




 Hmm, that makes me really wonder what authors have won awards in two such areas. Michael Chabon has both a Hugo and Pulitzer. Must be some others.  




  Highly successful authors will achieve a measure of success with anything they publish, but they are still most associated with, and have most of their sales in, one genre

Well, part of that is just a human need to put everything into a simple little box. It's much easier for critics and readers to think of people as doing just x or just y. This is especially true as time passes. As we move on, writers of the past get relegated to only a couple works that are representative. 

How many people have read a Bram Stoker novel other than Dracula, for example? But he wrote a bunch! In the future, lots of authors we think have tons of great works will be remembered for only 1 or 2 and easily pigeonholed as representative of this or that specific style 




 Is it that hard? 

Off the top of my head: 

* JK Rowling writes fantasy and mysteries (latter under pen name)

* John Banville writes lit fiction and mysteries (latter under pen name)

* Stephen King has had success in a ton of genres

* Lots of literary fiction writers have "genre" books that did well. Colson Whitehead, Cormac McCarthy, Ben Percey, etc. 

* LOTS of genre writers move freely between fantasy, science fiction, and horror. 

* A bazillion writers have had luck in both fiction and non-fiction

etc. 

The only people who seem to have a hard time with it are mediocore writers who just do really formulaic work in one niche.  




  They also take the risk on authors whose books may not earn back their advance, which means they use successful books to subsidise their gambles.

Yep, and thank god for that as far as I'm concerned. Basically all the books and movies I like are funded this way. If only sure-fire mass market hits ever were released culture would be really boring 




 There are certainly reasons why self-publishing is better, just saying that "suits" taking the money is sadly an issue everywhere 









 There are reasons to go self-pub and reasons to go traditional. But the "suits" are gonna have a field day either way. 

Sure, traditional publishing takes a bigger percentage but they also
* Pay an advance upfront
* pay to have the book printed
* Pay for editing, copyediting, proofing, and design
* and (hopefully) pay for some kind of marketing

In addition, they have distribution that gets you into bookstores

Amazon takes a much lower cut, but also does nothing at all for your book other than transfer digital files for essentially zero cents and provide a platform where your book exists alongside 10 million others. That's not that much for a 30% cut! 





























 You think suits at Amazon wont profit off you? 




 that merely wishing for something doesn't make that thing happen. You have to fight and act to get what you want, not just wish and hope.  




 Literary fiction tries to do new things with language, including trying new things with sentence lengths. 

That said, I think you are wrong this is restricted to literary fiction. Lots of genre fiction--thrillers, crime, erotica--loves chopppy sentence fragments for example thinking it adds "speed" to the text.  









 Getting paid to write free reviews on Goodreads/Amazon? That's... likely to be pretty unethical. People will only want to pay you to write positive reviews if you are being paid by authors and not by magazines.  




 Did you tell that anecdote on here yesterday? Swear I read that in another thread. I think that makes sense, but I wonder what  a class who only made 10 pots would do 




 Yeah, it's interesting because we tend to think that genre pays more than literary fiction, but every time I talk numbers with reddit genre writers they are getting lower advances than my literary writer friends. 

Not that the latter are making bank, but the genre writers here make it sound impossible to get more than 5-10k for your first couple books while my lit friends get more than that 




 I guess I just think the voice of "write mediocre stuff and dont' worry too much, it can sell if you work in an formulaic niche!" drowns out others here. I really have no problem with people who want to do that, but it can be just as satisfying or even more so to get an easy job to  pay the bills and then write carefully crafted work on the side.  




 Yikes! And you said it was a trilogy? She was paid 2k per book by Simon and Schuster? That's nuts. That's less than most small presses pay.  




  He's not entirely correct about literary awards. From all the data that is available about SFF ones, it does appear that they have a minor impact on sales nowadays, as opposed to how they impaced on the genre thirty, forty years ago. There is, however, still a bump - but what he ignores is that there are awards out there that do change and authors career. The Booker, the Pulitzer, the Nobel - these all result in generous sales and a new audience coming to the author.

Totally. A big award---National Book Award, Pulitzer, Booker---can have a HUGE impact on the sales of a book, especially if it is a low selling book. 

Here's an article on it: http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/awards-and-prizes/article/51573-just-how-much-does-a-pulitzer-prize-help-a-book-s-sales.html

It cites Jennifer Egan's Goon Squad more than tripling sales for several months after the win, and presumably that had a long tail effect. Paul Hardings Tinkers went from a  book only 1k people had bout to a book that's soon sold over 300k.  




 I guess what I mean is, I wonder if the issue---without knowing the books obviously---was less that the authors didnt' spend 10 years honing and more that they didn't build up the connections and platforms and/or put in the work to make the books a success. 

Anecdotally, I lot of my friends have started pretty promising careers publishing their first books in their mid/late 20s or early 30s, but they did it smartly. 

You are right that the midlist is dead though, especially for genre fiction. (For literary fiction, you can sustain a career teaching and such while selling at a midlist level and htere are presses dedicated to putting quality low selling work out.) 




  I read every single post on Dean Wesley Smith's site about publishing and it comes down to the same thing. Write more books.

This is generally true, but not always true. 

Jonathan Franzen is one of the best selling authors in recent history (not quite JK Rowling level, but his last two novels were in the top 5 best sellers the years they came out) and he only puts out a book every few years. 

 




 Is "being paid" really the only goal though? 

If you want to write and be paid, your best bet is to be prolific... writing non-fiction, probably for corporate newsletters. If you want to be paid writing fiction, your best bet is to write as quickly as possible without editing and pump out erotica. 

Nothing wrong with any of that, but I think we should keep in mind that there is value to writing work that you love, editing it carefully,  rewriting, and putting something out in the world that you generally feel needs to be there.  




 Such a great story! 




 Being published young can be really bad BUT your examples were about first books selling poorly and sadly there is little relation between craft/quality and sales. If your friends shitty books had sold like Twilight or 50 Shades, no one would have dropped them 









 ha yeah, not sure what hte author is asking? 

I get pretty bored by non-fiction books though and feel like most of the time I can glean the facts of a situation well enough from articles and essays instead of full books. Maybe that's what they mean?  




 I don't think most writers really write about themselves actually. We imbue different aspects of ourselves into different characters, sure, but you do that will all characters ideally. You don't just have the Mary Sue author character and a bunch of others. 

Certainly some books are highly autobiographical though (Proust's In Search of Lost Time, Babel's The Red Calvary Cycle, Joyce's A Portrati of the Artist as a Young Man, etc.) 






















































 Loved Sisters Brothers and McCarthy, haven't read the others mentioned on this though. DeWitt has a new novel coming out soon too 




 I'd say persuasion has very little to do with being right. Basically nothing. 

There's a reason we need fiction writers, creative non-fiction writers, and journalists to translate the "facts" of scientists, mathematicians, etc. 

I think the question is impossible though since it really depends on the audience how you can persuade them. Well, maybe that's the key: know your audience.  




 Pretty great book! I like Trout Fishing in America even more. But In Watermelon Sugar is like legit psychedelic hippie fiction 









  Before anyone mentions A Song of Ice and Fire, those books have tons of characters and I'm not just talking about unexpected deaths.

Yeah, and Ned dies at the end of the book he is the "protagonist" for, not the end.  


































 Okay one more reply: 

With **A Dance With Dragons**, the publisher announced it was mostly completed and being they were working on it on March 3rd, 2011. The book came out July 12 2011 after a huge rush from the publisher and Martin. So 4.5 months last time. Probably a good gauge.  




 If a book was literally 100% finished and proofread and copyedited and everything, a press could probably turn it around in 2 months. The printing process would take about a month, the shipping a week, and a few weeks to get the cover and other stuff in motion. Just a guess.  




 Well, in general books take a year to two years to see publication. It depends on when a publisher can fit the book in their schedule, there is more that goes into the planning than just when a book can come out quickest. Different books do well at different times, and you don't want to "compete" with similar books. So a big book of literary realism won't want to come out at the same time as a new Franzen, for example, especially if the same publisher is putting out both. 

But even if there is an open slot, it normally takes a few months to edit and proof, and then typically books are sent out to reviewers as "galleys" 4 to 8 months ahead of publication. This is to build buzz for the book and to allow reviewers to turn in reviews (many magazines need reviews written and ready a few months before hand.) 

**All that said...**

for a book like The Winds of Winter that will sell great no matter what there is no really need to worry about buzz or even advance reviews. AND since the publisher will want to put the book out ASAP to capture fan interest, they will slot it ASAP. So all the above concerns aren't much of a worry.

So that really means it is just a question of how long it takes Martin and his editor to do the edits, plus how long it takes to get the book printed and shipped to stores. I'd guess at least 3 months, probably more like 5. 














 I guess where we disagree is that this is about getting better products. Optimistically, it's about "fairness" in payouts (i.e., not letting authors scam the system). Pessimistically, it's about paying author's less.  




 Yep, people love to complain about "clickbait" but... it works! Quality doesn't drive eyeballs, most of the time.  




  Paying only for what can hold our interest will hopefully allow more differentiation among the level of quality of books I download. 

Why is that your assumption? I assume the exact opposite: only the same kind of books sell really well (mass market page turner fiction is very repetitive, just like reality TV, pop music, and blockbuster films have a very narrow range  of work). 

This model will probably make everyone write in the same kind of straight-forward prose, the same short cliffhanger laden chapters, etc. etc.  




 the barrier for entry... for the golfers? Are you saying there is too high of a barrier for entry... for readers? 

There are so many options for legal free books, cheap used books, and cheap ebooks that I really don't think there is any kind of cost barrier to read books.  




 I think it would mainly matter because of Amazon's reputation. If their goal is to be "the everything store," and they lose a lot of ground in their prestige books division it would really hurt their reputation.  









 The subscription services literally doesn't sell books, it lends them on an unlimited basis (the reader fee doesn't change)... and I'm pretty sure the program is exclusive, meaning you can't sell the books elsewhere if you are in the program. 

So... how do you think this will sell more books? I honestly don't understand what you think is happening.  




 Also, in a subscription service like this the goal is only to pay artists less. Netflix and Spotify are always trying to negotiate less payouts to artists, not "sell more music/movies" 




 Huh? I think you are confused here. This has nothing to do with selling more or less books. It's about how Amazon allots money in their unlimited subscription service. Before, they gave everyone the same amount of money if somene completed something like 20% of the book. Now it's all based on pages. 

It's like if Netflix payed TV shows per minute watched instead of per season. 

Netflix and Kindle Unlimited are subscription services with unlimited access to the content they have. They aren't selling more or less books here.  




 There's also just something a little insulting about only paying for what you finish, something that never happens in any other industry. 

Ate a big lunch and don't finish your burger at dinner? You don't pay the restaurant half prize. 

Get a call and have to leave the baseball game you attended? You don't get a refund on the last third of your stadium ticket. 

Only play 3 holes at the putt-putt and get bored? You don't get your money back. 

Granted this is currently just a program that doesn't encompass all that much work, but if this is a wedge meant to be moved to other programs it is really problematic.  









 Amazon's objective is not to sell books, per se. Their goal is to make money. If they can make more money selling other things, or giving away books for free, or ripping off author's and giving them a lower cut, they will in a heartbeat. 

Also, books are less than 10% of Amazon's business. They don't really care that much how well books on the site sell.  









 I'd say American culture in general is anti-reading and anti-intellectual these days. Been like that for a long time, but got really ramped up during the Bush years (even from liberals) 




 In my personal experience, undergrad writing classes are very different from grad classes or non-school workshops. Basically, undergrad classes are filled with kids looking for "an easy A" or with just kids who are only  just starting out. Basically, not filled with serious writers so teachers can only teach so much.  
































































 Ebooks do this already, kinda. Ebook prices tend to start high and go low with regular deals. Things like bookbub team with publishers to do .99 cent and 1.99 deals too to boost Amazon sales ranking.  









 (I mean, Shakespeare's men literally performed at court for the king and the rest, they didnt' only perform at the globe) 




  It wasn't until late in his life that he performed for King James.

King James became the official patron in 1603, Shakespeare died in 1616. Most of Shakespeare's big plays were in that time (King Lear, MacBeth, Othello, The Tempest, etc.)

Shakespeare's first play was 14 years before King James was the patron. So 14 years before, 12 years after (for last written play.) Basically half his career was that. 

But anyway, before the King was his patron the Lord Chamberlain was the patron. 

Honestly, a theater crowd in a big city is not really "literally the masses." There isn't really a way to compare any artist from Shakespeare's time to modern mass entertainment. How many people do you think went to the Globe during Shakespeare's life? Surely only a fraction of the people who have purchased a Harry Potter book, listened to a Beyonce song, or watched The Avengers. (London's entire population was less than 200,000 in Shakespeare's time.) Mass culture literally didn't exist back then. The technology wasn't there to distribute it. 

The Globe certainly had city dwellers attending, but Shakespeare also preformed for nobility. Certainly you can say Shakespeare wrote for both the masses and the elites, but you can't say it was only the former. 
 




 Why do people think Shakesperae only wrote for "the common man"? Dude was employed by the King, and by nobility before that. Most of his plays are about princes and kings, and many are based on historical nobility. 

Yeah, he threw in a few dick jokes too, but that doesn't mean he was writing Charles Bukowski stories.  




 No, I mean I think that's a fairly common opinion actually.  









 Sure... but look, most changes authors would make are often pretty small. Like most of the time, a new "draft"---after the first few--just fixes some small errors or makes minor changes throughout. 

I'm sure most authors have a few sentences they'd change or whatever, but that's not very interesting for a thread like this where people are talking more about major changes 




 No, it doesn't stand to reason that infinite drafts would make a work infinitely better. Many of the great works of literature were written overnight with only minor revisions (Kafka's The Judgement is one example, also Ginsberg's Howl allegedly). The draft fetishism of contemporary writing is just that, a fetish. 

It's not that flaws improve a book per se, but that what many people think of as a "problem" is often what makes a book interesting. Like this thread is filled with people wanting to "fix" great books by removing what makes them unique and making them more like standard commercial fiction books.  









 The press that owned the book rights, I guess? Presses can often sell the rights to a book to another press, so King's contract probably had him get half of that.  




 Honestly, nothing for any book I like. Flaws and imperfections are part of what makes art great, honestly. Most attempts to "fix" great works would just make them more bland.  









 Great breakdown, seems right to me.  




 This is a GREAT example of why agents are important. So many people on here like to act like agents are all scam artists who never help authors. A good agent, even just an okay one, is worth their fee. 

My own agent bumped my advance up enough that it covered their fee and more.  






















































 Hmm, not sure I agree with a lot of this. 

 And then they don't put bookstores everywhere.  

Even at the height of the video store game, my hometown had at least as many bookstore as video stores. Now, there is only one video store (that I can think of) and still over a dozen bookstores. 

 The biggest difference is that almost everyone watches movies, but most people don't read. 

The first stat I find says 76% of adults read at least one book in last year. That's not great, but most Americans DO read even if it is only one book a year. People certainly watch way more movies than they read books, but OTOH we are talkinga bout video rental stores. Most americans pre-Netflix era probably just watched TV and went to the cinema now and then.  




 not sure you can game much with ebooks. you could add more paragraph breaks to stretch pages out, but you couldn't like increase the font (the user controls that)
