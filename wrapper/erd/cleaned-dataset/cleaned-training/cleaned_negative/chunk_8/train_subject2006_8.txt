 I absolutely love mine. I use it daily to cover my under-eye circles and my quite red nose. I use the shade Vanilla and use it under the Nars powder foundation (Deauville) and it lasts all day without creasing. 

I would recommend putting it on in stages and working fairly quickly. If you let it sit too long on your skin before blending it can get wonky.  




 I would recommend going to Sephora or another makeup store that has a good reputation. I then wait to ask a SA that has foundation that looks good. Then I ask them for help. 

The other factor that I had to overcome is speaking up when a foundation isn't what you want. If it doesn't look right on your skin, say so. They will bee understanding and try again. 




 I THIRD this recommendation - I'm actually glad you have the link because I got these as a stocking stuffer at Christmas and I LOVE them. They work really, really well.  




 I think this is an amazing tutorial by MonsiieurAlex on applying blush: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq_IRULlz4w

He is gearing it specifically towards red blush but it applies to any shade. It is perfect for highly pigmented blushes (think Nars, Tarte, etc). It really revolutionized the way that I apply blush - even with bright/bold shades you have a refined and polished look. 




 I am an art curator and my colleagues and I had the wonderful opportunity to see an advanced screening of The Monuments Men last night. I thought it was delightfully entertaining and did a tremendous job of getting people to care about art. So, thanks. I hope you enjoyed portraying my profession, albeit in a far more dramatic time. 




 Well, I can vouch for the trains in Japan (at least in the Osaka area). If a train is even slightly delayed the board will show how many minutes behind it is and when you disembark if it has been late longer than a few minutes, they'll give you a slip as you pass through the turnstile. 




 I got a Target coupon the other day for this - I was excited before but now I'm SUPER JAZZED 




 Having once been a poor teenager myself, keep an eye out for 2 for 1 deals. I occasionally see them at Target for CoverGirl mascaras. Its a fantastic deal, just keep the second tube sealed until you need it!  




 I was going to say the same thing about the mascara - I would suggest getting a new tube. You'd probably have more volume and less clumping of your lashes. I love the way you created this - I like seeing each step! 




 What area of town would it be in? 




 The high pigmented matte pencils? I do love the colors but I haven't tried that formula. I do, however, love the Cashmere lip cream - it lasts all day for me. 




 I've always noticed it too - I'm sure the main reason is not verisimilitude but a more interesting shot. It's way more compelling to see people moving and different situations than just two people sitting at table. And especially if you're a crime show where you are constantly questioning people, it would make for some pretty static television.  




 Word. My chow absolutely refuses to come inside when it snows, its the climate he was bred for and he absolutely loves it. 




 In the United States, if you donate art you can get:

* An immediate income tax deduction
* Avoidance of the tax on capital gains on appreciated assets
* An estate and gift tax deduction

I believe there are similar incentives in other countries. 

On the museum side of things, it is a form of income, and therefore is valid to their taxes. But it is also important for them to have an accurate understanding of value for insurance. 

TL;DR: Tax write-offs 




 I'm not familiar with the laws and regulations in Slovenia but many countries do have [laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_trove) requiring finds to be made known to the government. Typically, if the government is interested in keeping the find, the finder is compensated monetarily. 

Even if Slovenia doesn't have this sort of regulation, it is wise to have it appraised. Typically though, a reputable museum would require you to have an appraisal before a gift was made (for tax reasons - both yours and the museums).  




 What a great opportunity for you to educate him otherwise! And if still feels that way he can go fuck himself! 




 I think this is a really beautiful "no makeup" look - I think a little pop of color would had a lot of punch! You have such lovely skin tone I think you would look gorgeous with a dark lip 




 I will say, I think you're 'everyday look' brings polish to your look - you definitely look gorgeous either way though. 




 Ha, I make sure that the label isn't facing out - no matter what it is or what I use it for - Monistat just makes people think of yeasty vagoos. 




 PREACH 




 Needlepoint/Cross-stitch is pretty great too. You can get all the materials for quite cheap and a project can really last a while! I've worked on some for years on end. It's not super hard either - so it's perfect to do while watching tv or a movie. 




 You're most welcome! 

As for getting color matched, the service is indeed free! Just be honest with them, I've never felt pressure when I was up front about my intentions. A sales person at Sephora or a department store will understand the importance of figuring out how a foundation wears throughout the day and not in the first five minutes you have it on. Just the other day I went to test some products in order to make a wish list for Christmas. I told this to the salesperson at the start, and she was very helpful in picking out products, colors and application. If you feel nervous still, say something like, "Hi, I've never used a whole lot of makeup, but I'm interested in getting a foundation but I have no idea where to start. I want light to medium coverage and my price range is $xx-xx. Could you help me get color matched and find some options? Since I'm so new to this, I would really like to test one or two out before I commit." 

As for your brows, too bad about the Brow Bar! I've heard great things about it - but I actually only had my brows shaped once and I have just maintained them since. Maybe ask among your friends if anybody has a person they trust? And yes, typically if you have long hairs I just take tiny scissors (the same I use for my nails) and I just trim them. 

I also forgot to mention that it might help you to have some basic make up brushes. The ELF brushes are very affordable and will be better than the small applicators that will come with makeup. To start out I would recommend a brush for blush and two eyeshadow (one for blending - the package will probably use this as a descriptor). 




 No. 12 Corail Fauve is my jaaaam! 




 As for your skin - I would say that you probably have combination skin. Do you have a typical routine? Perhaps consider getting into a basic skin care routine. Start out with basic cleanser (I actually just use plain [Neutrogena glycerine soap](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Original-Formula-Soap-Ounce/dp/B000052YLL/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228154 sr=8-3 keywords=neutrogena+glycerin+soap) which retails at $5 or less) as well as a moisturizer. Some that many people like are [Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream Fragrance Free Moisturizer](http://www.amazon.com/Olay-Regenerist-Micro-Sculpting-Cream-Ounce/dp/B0012J30LY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228237 sr=8-1 keywords=Olay+Regenerist+Micro+Sculpting+Cream+Fragrance+Free+Moisturizer) (Retails around $22, I personally use this and love it. I have skin more on the dryer side of combination) or [Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer](http://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Positively-Radiant-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B001IM5VT4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228270 sr=8-2 keywords=Aveeno+Positively+Radiant+Daily+Moisturizer) (retails at around $15). Feel free to experiment though. Try using both at least daily - see how your skin feels after about a week or so. 

In addition to this face care - I would recommend getting an eye makeup remover if you are planning on wearing any kind of eye makeup. I think the [Up and Up brand at Target](http://www.target.com/p/up-up-makeup-remover-5-5-oz/-/A-11573878#prodSlot=medium_1_1 term=Up+and+Up+makeup+remover) is fantastic. Use this with some cotton pads or even TP, and it will be much much gentler on your eyes than just soap. 

Since you have typically not used a lot of makeup I'm assuming that you would not be so keen on a full coverage foundation. You have quite nice skin so you can definitely use something on the lighter side. A great concealer that many people like is the [Hard Candy Glamoflauge Concealer](http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Candy-Glamoflauge-CONCEALER-pencil/dp/B009Z3MG0K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228376 sr=8-3 keywords=hard+candy+glamoflauge+concealer) (retails Around $8.50). If you want more coverage, perhaps [Cover Girl Clean Foundation](http://www.amazon.com/CoverGirl-Sensitive-Liquid-Makeup-Bottles/dp/B003FBRVCQ/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228411 sr=8-6 keywords=Cover+Girl+Clean+Foundation) is quite nice ($5-6). I personally feel more comfortable with more coverage and I am willing to splurge for something that works really well for me. If you feel you might like something more - consider going to [Sephora and getting color matched](http://www.sephora.com/color-iq). Then test more than one and ask for samples. Don't buy on the spot - see how it feels and looks throughout the day, then buy. 

In terms of blush, I would try the [Nyx Powder Blush](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod3020029#). I think the Mocha or Desert Rose shade would be really nice with your coloring. 

I think your brows look fantastic - you may want to have them very slightly shaped. [Benefit Brow Bar](http://www.benefitcosmetics.com/brand/boutiqueoverview/browbars) can help - they are typically pretty great. It doesn't look like you need to fill them in at all. If you want to have them held in place consider a clear wax, but it may not be necessary. 

Eyeshadow and eyeliner can really help your eyes pop from behind glasses. [Maybelline Eye Studio gel liner](http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-Studio-Lasting-Eyeliner-Blackest/dp/B0030HNNS6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228796 sr=8-1 keywords=maybelline+eye+studio+gel+eyeliner) is crazy fantastic but it might be above your skill level if you're not used to lining your eyes. It comes in a small pot with a brush. It is wonderfully opaque and I find a lot easier than liquid eyeliner. If you would prefer a pencil eyeliner, consider [NYX Slide On Eyes pencils](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod3490137 _requestid=394187#). Feel free to have fun with eyeshadows - I think you can get some fun shades from both [ELF](http://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-studio-geometric-eyeshadow-palette-36-pc-glam/-/A-14653350#prodSlot=large_1_11 term=Elf) or [Wet 'n' Wild](http://www.target.com/p/eye-shadow-380b-ic-13oz-eggshell/-/A-13966411#prodSlot=medium_1_27 term=wet+n+wild) and they are super cheap. Mascara - I think [Cover Girl Clump Crusher](http://www.target.com/p/covergirl-lashblast-clump-crusher-mascara/-/A-14293835#prodSlot=medium_1_32 term=Cover+Girl+) (green tube) is some of the best. You have really gorgeous brown eyes - I would consider some subtle green tones, or even shimmery brown neutrals. 

As for not rubbing eyes - a lot of self control! When you get an itch - try delicately using the tip of your fingernail.

I hope this helps! I tried to cover the basics - there is of course more you can get into, but this is a good place to start. Check out the sidebar on the MakeupAddiction page - it may help you further. 

 




 I have perpetually dry skin but it is much worse in the midwestern winter. Are you using any kind of exfoliate? That is what has revolutionized my skin. I use the **Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peel** which I call Black Magic Face Pads. They are not cheap but they are worth every penny. I use them daily in winter and usually every other day in the summer months. I follow up with any moisturizer - I've been using **Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream** recently, but I have used others in the past. The great thing about the Black Magic Pads is that it really *fixes* your dryness. I can wear *any* foundation.  




 I *love* the YSL Glossy Stains. I just got one for my birthday - they are my go-to lip colors! 




 These are fantastic! I've been doing another playthrough on 1999 Mode and have gotten a bit stuck - I think this is just the motivation I need to power through! 




 Oh most certainly - I guess I've just seen it manifest itself in troubling ways there. 




 Mine broke a few weeks in - it came off in one piece though - so I can put it back in its position. I then just lift it out and use either side.  




 [Ugggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh](http://imgur.com/UH7RPYF) This stuff is Tumblr gold and it is so depressing. Its common with the extrovert vs. introvert dichotomy too - there's a ton of comics, etc. that portray introverts as beautifully misunderstood intellectuals who just want to read and extroverts as piggish idiots. 

I personally don't want to be defined by a stereotype and I embrace my idiosyncrasies.  I am an extrovert. I am a librarian. I am a Makeup Addict. These aren't contradictions.  




 I really love that lip color - do you have a product list?

Also, I love your username :)
