  The Family? 




 Thanks for this response I think I will apply in 3rd year for training contracts with my LPC funded. I had gotten so caught up in thinking about what I would do when I finished 3rd year that I had forgotten that I'd receive help applying etc in my third year.  




 Thanks this has been a great insight! 




 Thanks, did you get your LPC funded by a training contract? Is it common for it to be funded by the training contract?  




 Touching the void?  




 It's a lovely idea but I'm already sorted housing wise for next year and it sadly isn't practical for me to just hop countries for a year. 

Thanks for your reply though.  




 I'm currently a second year law student plodding my way through my degree. 

I know that I want to do my Law Practicing Course (LPC) once I finish my three years and then move onto a training contract. But, I also want a year out to live in News Zealand. 

Would I be best having a year out and then do my LPC which would hopefully be funded through a training contract? Or would I be best doing my LPC straight away after these 3 years and then have a year out and then go onto a training contract? The downside to the latter is that I would have to fund the 10,000 LPC myself. 

How common is it that training contracts fund LPCs? 

Any help/comments/sharing of own experiences would be great.
