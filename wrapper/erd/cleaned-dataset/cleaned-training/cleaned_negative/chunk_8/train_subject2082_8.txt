 Quite misleading that the tags are "TOP ITALIAN MOVIES" and "ITALIAN MOVIES". Also, I don't know if movies like Eat Pray Love (2010) and Angels   Demons (2009) should be called classic movies at all. 




 Thumbs up. Great and beautiful film by Mizoguchi, one of his best ones. 




 I wouldn't say that I hate his movies, I mostly just dislike them. Of course, there are directors that are much, much worse. In my opinion, Nolan doesn't really know how to tell with pictures, which is his biggest problem. That's something I have stated before. He usually explains too much, especially using voice-over and/or dialogue, just to take an example. That makes his movies very empty. He doesn't seem to know how to be subtle. For me, to be overly clear about everything isn't something good, it doesn't leave much to the viewer. Therefore, his movies tend to be superficial as hell. I've never been a big fan of him. 




 Modern Times (1936), Safety Last! (1923), The General (1926), Duck Soup (1933), and Mon oncle (1958) are some examples. Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, the Marx brothers, and Tati are some names that were and still are very important to comedy films overall. 




 Some of my absolute favourite movies in that list. I love how he admired films by Teshigahara, Bergman, Mizoguchi, Antonioni and Bresson, some of my favourite directors as well as himself, heh. Tarkovsky had great taste! 




 Not that I care about the movie that much, but this poster looks much better than the original one, which is quite ugly:

 Don't you mean July? 




 I'm doing this myself, just not that super actively. Anyways, a random order is probably the easiest, because you get a little bit more diversity that way, and it's harder to get tired of the project overall. But it all depends on yourself. If a director doesn't have that many films in the collection, then it could be helpful and easier to watch those in a row, for example. Or if you want to have a certain director's films close to eacher to compare etc. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer.    

If you go to ICheckMovies, you can order the Criterion list by release year, runtime and a bit of other choices. That can maybe be helpful too:    

https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/the+criterion+collection/   


You have the official site and the Wikipedia page to help you as well:   

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Criterion_Collection_DVD_and_Blu-ray_releases


 




 You should! Actually, it's being released on Blu-ray by Criterion Collection in about a week.

Here's a review that came up some weeks ago:  

http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Hiroshima-mon-amour-Blu-ray/103958/    

The restoration/transfer looks amazing. It scored a full 5.0 rating on video, audio and even the extras. The Criterion sale Barnes   Noble are having is starting any day soon, which means 50% on everything from the collection, I am so buying this! If you want to get your hands on it, this is a great opportunity, just a tip! 




 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) would be a great choice to start with. 




 As I said, it was a while ago I read it, so I can't say that I remember too much of it. I remember that I didn't have any problem with it at least. If I recall it correctly, I think I liked the beginning of the book the most, before Red and the others actually went into the zone. I'm guessing you read it in English (considering your link)? I read it translated in Swedish, so maybe our experiences weren't totally the same because of that too. 




 Indeed. I read it a couple of years ago, great stuff. 




 Nothing going on that's been established, but check out his page on IMDb:   
http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027572/    

If there's any news, they will probably be to the right, the "Related News" column. 




 16 movies I haven't seen from that list. Otherwise, it's quite a mainstream list with a big focus on films from the Anglosphere and Hollywood. I wouldn't even consider having a big chunk of those movies near my own top 300, but each to their own. 




  Is there a site out there that rates image quality of blu ray releases?

http://www.blu-ray.com/ does that. http://www.dvdbeaver.com/ can help you with their Blu-ray reviews as well. 




 Yeah, I like all those three more as well. Double Indemnity (1955) is my favourite by him. One of the best film noir flicks! The Lost Weekend (1945), Stalag 17 (1953) and Ace in the Hole (1951) are some other Wilder films I think are better than Some Like It Hot (1959) too. 




  I did, however, notice that sometimes the definition can be distracting when watching older movies (70's-80's).   

Can you elaborate what you mean? It always depends on the transfer, some can be worse than others. But for me, I have never had an exception where I wanted to watch the DVD of a film instead of the Blu-ray (if I have access to both of them and in terms of quality), not yet at least. 




 Or maybe she just has a different taste than you? A movie isn't automatically and objectively good just because it has a high IMDb rating. Taste is subjective. Of course, it's a bit of a far stretch to call everyone who rates movies on IMDb and RT idiots, because that would include people that dislike certain movies as much as she does, so that should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.    


 but she actively dislikes really good ones.    

That sounds strange, I think it's just that she probably dislikes some of the movies you think are good, which isn't the same thing. Everyone doesn't like every movie you like, that's just the way the world is. Deal with it. 




 Good for you! 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_cinema 




 Great director! Which of his movies have you seen so far? Criterion Collection's release of the Apu trilogy is probably going to be neat! 




 You can't go wrong with some Ozu and Fassbinder!

 The classic monster list! I should maybe take care of that one soon, I still got 21 entries in it left to see. 




 A great list overall. The only movie on the list which I didn't like that much was Some Like It Hot (1959) that I rated 2/5, all the other ones are 3/5, 4/5 and some 5/5 in my book. Maybe I should rewatch the Wilder film, I would maybe like it more now, I like some of his other movies nonetheless. 




 A pity! No, I haven't seen them, but I want to do it! 




 Well, I want to see Eisenstein in Guanajuato (2015), I was just sticking to the five I look forward to the most. Jia Zhangke's new film could be interesting to see too, but I had to admit that I wasn't really a big fan of the three films I've seen by him so far. On the other hand, I'll still watch some of his other movies anyways, maybe I'll find someone I like a bit more than the others. 




 I had a nice movie weekend myself. Watched fifteen movies, which will do for now. It's Monday and 4:19 in the morning here, so I'm going to bed now. Oh, and the best ones were Ghare-Baire (1984) by Satyajit Ray, Tsuma wa kokuhaku suru (1961) by Yasuz Masumura and Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto (1970) by Elio Petri. Great stuff. Now I got [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OyP2fQRSzI) song stuck in my head, all because of the Petri movie and Morricone. 




 Does it? Do you know something I don't? The last thing I heard was that he was going to make a whole new movie after he cancelled the film that was going to be called Flashmob, but I haven't heard any more details, just that it will be shot in France. 




 For the first time? 




 I think it was L'eclisse (1962) by Michelangelo Antonioni. 




 There's a chance for that, sure. 




 Or even better, a 49 minute scene where he meets Woody Allen and they go for lunch to discuss Ingmar Bergman's movies. 




 Nattvardsgsterna (1963) and Smultronstllet (1957) by Ingmar Bergman. 




 I'm mostly excited about these:   


* Ji-geum-eun-mat-go-geu-ddae-neun-teul-li-da (2015) *(Hong Sang-soo)*    
* Le Louvre sous l'Occupation (2015) *(Aleksandr Sokurov)*   
* Rak ti Khon Kaen (2015) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)*    
* Taxi (2015) *(Jafar Panahi)*   
* Umimachi Diary (2015) *(Hirokazu Koreeda)*   

I'm hoping that Abbas Kiarostami, Lav Diaz and Michael Haneke are giving us with new movies as well. I know at least that Haneke and Kiarostami are both working on something new, but those will probably not be released this year. We'll see. 




 * A Clockwork Orange (1971)   
* Hud (1963)
* Taxi Driver (1976)   
* The Hustler (1961)     




 Le trou (1960), the suspense nearly killed me the first time I watched it! A true masterpiece and the best prison film ever made! 




 Oh, there's probably hundreds of movies I own that I haven't watched yet. I try to buy movies as often I can, so I usually always own something I haven't watched. I watch movies via streaming and movies that aren't my own as well for example, so that's also another reason that there's always unwatched films in my own personal collection. I always have movies to watch, whether it's in my own collection, via streaming or any other way, so there's a lot left to see for me. Too little time, too many films! I just don't have the time and possibility to watch exactly everything at once. I recently bought San taam (2007) and Tky sonata (2008) for instance (both were Eureka releases (Masters of Cinema) and on dual format), which I haven't watched at all, but I just got both a couple of days ago. So it's all a matter of time and what to prioritize. 




 Exactly, same here. But does your partner hate them even if the movie is in a language your partner isn't fluent in? 




 Woody Allen. 




 Robert Bresson is a great example. He started with a slapstick comedy, then doing a bit more regular/classic dramas, and after that, he evolved his style with his own set of "rules" of uncompromising minimalism where he totally abandoned classic filmmaking and did movies the way no one ever did before, just to come as far away from the theatre as possible, which he felt didn't belong in film. 




 You really do that? I have never heard about anyone who does this, seems like a strange way to watch a film if it's in a language you don't know for example, especially if it's a film with much dialogue. Does it work well for you? 




 I always use them if they're available, even when a movie is in a language I already know. It's easy to miss something, dialogue volume can be low sometimes etc. And when it comes to watching movies in languages you don't know, it's quite mandatory and essential to have subtitles if you don't want to make it harder for yourself. And there's no one that knows every single language in the world either. 




 If you ask me, it's a movie that actually has something to say, about film, consumtion and our society as well. People are of course free to call it off as "pointless garbage", but I think there's a lot of people that don't understand it at all, which is a bit sad. I'm not judging everybody who didn't like it, only stating that I've seen viewers who completely misunderstood it or didn't get it and labeled it as bad because of that. Also, you have to have seen a fair share of cinema to get all the intertextuality, there's a certain reference to one of Tarkovsky's movies in the ending, just to take an example of something that actually is connected to the movie. 




 I have no idea what you have seen, so I'll chip in with all my favourite films:    


* Der siebente Kontinent (1989) *(Michael Haneke)*     
* Andrey Rublyov (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*    
* L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*    
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*     
* Tanin no kao (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*     
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*    
* Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*    
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959) *(Alain Resnais)*   
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*    
* Stntang (1994) *(Bla Tarr)*    
* Krhozat (1988) *(Bla Tarr)*    
* Le trou (1960) *(Jacques Becker)*   
* C'era una volta il West (1968) *(Sergio Leone)*     
* Sanma no aji (1962) *(Yasujir Ozu)*   
* Smultronstllet (1957) *(Ingmar Bergman)*    
* Pickpocket (1959) *(Robert Bresson)*    
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*    
* Tystnaden (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*   
* La notte (1961) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*      
* Zerkalo (1975) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*    
* Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956) *(Robert Bresson)*   
* Stalker (1979) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*   
* Solyaris (1972) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*   
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969) *(Juraj Herz)*   
* Jalsaghar (1958) *(Satyajit Ray)*   
* Banshun (1949) *(Yasujir Ozu)*   

It would be nice to know if you haven't seen any of them already. If there's some you've missed, it would be really interesting to hear those you will be watching and the verdict later on! 




 I would say that it's certainly not your second choice. Basically, it's a message about violence in the media, Haneke himself wrote an essay about his thoughts concerning this, it can be found in the book A Companion to Michael Haneke. I would suggest to look it up if you are interested in his views and if you want to clear some light about the movie as well. 




 I would recommend that you look up some of the stuff Criterion Collection and Eureka (Masters of Cinema) have released, they both usually have great transfers and often release important and great films together with interesting bonus features.

Here's three movies I would really advice to pick up which are great and look stunning on Blu-ray:    

* L'eclisse (1962) (Criterion Collection)    
* Pickpocket (1959) (Criterion Collection)    
* Seppuku (1962) (Masters of Cinema)    

http://www.blu-ray.com/ is also a good source if you want to know a bit more about certain releases, they have many reviews where they for example go a little more in-depth about the video quality etc. 




 I really disliked Chappie (2015) (which I talked about why in several other threads) and thought that Ex Machina (2015) was mediocre, but I think you shouldn't rely on what movies you should watch based on the majority of Reddit. This isn't a site where you will find the universal truth about which movies are good and bad, because there's no such thing. And you really shouldn't expect Reddit to know exactly what you would like, that's just foolish. Nothing here has anything to do with right or wrong as well, rather different opinions. I didn't recommend Ex Machina (2015), so I guess the rest of Reddit can take care of your "fuck you". 




 http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/directors/  

I would say that list is the one to go with if you want something already established, it's a great starting point. It's a list with a lot of great movies that are good to have seen and to know about if you're just getting interested in cinema, as well as essential and important ones. It also gets you introduced to films from several different countries and decades. 




 Hiroshima mon amour (1959), directed by Alain Resnais and with a script by Marguerite Duras, has one of the best voice-overs in my opinion. What I like about it is that Resnais didn't just use voice-over narration for the sake of the pictures, but to asks questions, make points and describe memories for example. Of course, anyone can do that, but I don't think any movie can tackle it the same way as Hiroshima mon amour (1959) did.     


There's also not only one voice-over, but two, because there's two central characters to be concerned about. I just love how the editing and the images work together with the two voice-overs and form the narrative together with its central themes of time, space, memories and subjectivity to add more complexity to the exploration of the problems with our existance, especially communication and the impossibility to fully know a human being. Also, while doing this, we travel back and forth to both the present and the past. Even the beginning of the movie starts with the two characters talking through a voice-over narration where one of them claims one thing and the other one the total opposite, because it's a film that has to do with opposites and contradictions.    

I can go on talking, but I won't spoil too much of everything for those who haven't seen it, this movie is mandatory to see if you're interested in cinema. It's a very poetic, complex and beautiful masterpiece that has a very special use of voice-over narration.     

On another one, I think Robert Bresson's use of voice-over should be mentioned too, especially in his later movies. We had a thread about him some weeks ago, so I won't go in-depth about him once again, but as he was a perfectionist and a minimalist, his use of voice-over was as well very special and precise, everything was well calculated and he was quite determined when it came to strip down everything to its bare essentials. His book explains a bit about his own "rules" and what he thought about the relation between sounds and images, very interesting if you haven't read it. 




 Stalker (1979) and Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969). 




 Have you searched?     

Whole Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/search?q=Seeking+a+Friend+for+the+End+of+the+World   

This subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/search?q=Seeking+a+Friend+for+the+End+of+the+World restrict_sr=on       

I would say that 202 user reviews on IMDb it's a lot if we are talking about movies that should deserve more attention. I think it's a bit unfair to the ones that really deserve it. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012) is a typical movie that I didn't even have to actively seek out to find about, I saw it advertised on YouTube, IMDb and similar big sites without putting any effort to it. I think if one is going to pick a movie that truly deserves more attention, it should actually be one that most people haven't heard of, that's faded in obscurity, quite forgotten, rarely mentioned and not talked about a lot, a movie where you actually have to be a bit active to find out. Of course, you can find stuff by sheer luck, but I hope you get my point.     

But maybe it has to do with how much you are into movies. A big majority here in this subreddit label movies like Moon (2009) and Sunshine (2007) as not so well known, which I think says quite much.    




 Really? There's been several threads about this movie here, and people have been talking about it in other threads as well. There's over 150 critics that reviewed it on Rotten Tomatoes and 129 pages with reviews by the audience on the same site. There's also over 202 user reviews for it on IMDb and I see people mentioning it on a lot of other various sites. That's just some examples, it feels like it has gotten its share of attention, because there's a lot other movies that don't even get a third of that much awareness. That's why I think it's a bit strange to mention a movie like that. Maybe you just missed all the talk.    


Anyways, if I have to pick one movie, I would say Tobenai chinmoku (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki. It seems that I'm the only one that has mentioned it here on Reddit, I couldn't find anything if I searched for it, not even by the English title. A quite forgotten gem, only 159 users have rated in on IMDb for example. I would easily consider it one of the best Japanese movies ever made, it really deserves to be talked about more. There's not even a proper DVD/Blu-ray release of it yet, which I hope will change in the future.  




 All of them are great and some I would consider the best films ever made. Criterion Collection has released all of them on DVD and three of them on Blu-ray. Some other studios have released them on DVD and Blu-ray as well, you can find more information on http://www.blu-ray.com/ regarding the Blu-ray versions. Three of them are also available to stream on Hulu. 




 It can be a glitch, or maybe it's not just updated yet. It's a very new movie, so there's probably many more reviews coming in a couple of days. 




 Five of my favourites when it comes to such films:    

* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*    
Takes place entirely in the house of the main character.    

* L'anne dernire  Marienbad (1961) *(Alain Resnais)*   
Takes place in a chateau.    

* Le trou (1960) *(Jacques Becker)*   
Takes pretty much place a prison only.    

* Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*   
Takes place by the seaside in the desert, almost entirely in a sandhole.   

* Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956) *(Robert Bresson)*   
Takes place in a prison.     




 Yeah, but that's only 5 reviews. 




 Here's fifteen recommendations you just have to watch:    

* A Woman Under the Influence (1974) *(John Cassavetes)*   
* Akai satsui (1964) *(Shhei Imamura)*          
* Angst vor der Angst (1975) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*          
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*    
* Il deserto rosso (1964) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)* 
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*       
* Jen (1967) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*    
* Mouchette (1967) *(Robert Bresson)*   
* Mulholland Dr.	(2001) *(David Lynch)*       
* Opening Night (1977) *(John Cassavetes)*       
* Persona (1966) *(Ingmar Bergman)*         
* Possession (1981) *(Andrzej Zulawski)*      
* Repulsion (1965) *(Roman Polanski)*   
* Tsuma wa kokuhaku suru (1961) *(Yasuz Masumura)*           
* Tystnaden (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*   

These are what I would consider some of the best tragic and dark female character studies ever made. 




 If you start chronologically, you begin with Sono otoko, kyb ni tsuki (1989), which will work quite well as a starting point, it's a movie more oriented in action and police stuff. Or if you want to start with something more of a drama/comedy, go with Kikujir no natsu (1999), it's one of his most loved movies and it's quite easy to like as well as accessible. 




 Best:    

* Andrey Rublyov (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*       
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*        
* L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*    
* Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*         
* Tanin no kao (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*        

Worst:     

* A Room with a View (1985) *(James Ivory)*    
* Armageddon (1998) *(Michael Bay)*   
* Lat sau san taam (1992) *(John Woo)*     
* The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fift with His Battell Fought at Agincourt in France (1944) *(Laurence Olivier)*    
* The Rock (1996) *(Michael Bay)*    




 Nobi (1959) by Kon Ichikawa. 




 Huh? 




 * Den-en ni shisu (1974) *(Shji Terayama)*     
* Les quatre cents coups (1959) *(Franois Truffaut)*     




 They don't have connected plots, so it doesn't matter. But make sure to watch all of them, it's some good stuff. 




 Here's two recommendations:       

* Ich mchte kein Mann sein (1918) *(Ernst Lubitsch)*    

It's about Ossi, she's revolting against her parents because they want her to be like a proper young lady, instead she goes to buy men's clothes and starts acting like a man. A little gem that's quite entertaining and charming.    


* Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru (1918) *(Victor Sjstrm)*   

In my opinon, Sjstrm was easily the best of the Swedish directors from the silent era. This one is about Berg-Ejvind that is running away from justice. He comes to work at widow Halla's farm and they fall in love. But when the truth about him is revealed, he and Halla decide to flee to the mountains. Sjstrm really proves that he was great at capturing nature in this movie. Not my favourite by him, but really worth watching. 




 Great film, one the best ones from the last fifteen years. I should rewatch it soon. 




 Suna no onna (1964) by Hiroshi Teshigahara. 




 Welt am Draht (1973) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder could count. Solyaris (1972) by Andrei Tarkovsky is another one mixing science fiction and mystery. None of them have that much to do with detectives, even though Welt am Draht (1973) has a detective in it, but I'm guessing you were after either detective stories or mysteries? 




 Well, maybe the "fault" is rather within yourself than me. You can always use Google to look up the movies you don't recognize. I even wrote the names of the directors. If I don't recognize something myself, I just look it up instead of trying to make a fuzz about it, attacking someone or anything similar. There is nothing that hinders you from anything at all. We are on the Internet, information is easy to find.    


 If you want to post on a Japanese site to talk about a Japanese film, would you use the French or English title?     

As I already said, I always use the original titles.    




 Oh, there's so much great Japanese cinema. I've picked out 40 of my absolute favourites when it comes to Japanese films for you:     

* Tanin no kao (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*

I hope you'll find something you like. With this list, you'll also get introduced to some of the great and important directors from Japan as well. 




  It's pretentious as fuck.    

No, it's not. It's rather pretentious to put so much focus on it as you seem to do.   

I have explained this a lot of times before, but I guess I have to do it again. I always use the original titles when writing, because that's my standard and those are the original titles that the directors wanted to have in the first place. Every single movie doesn't have alternate or English titles either, and I don't want to be mixing everything around for the sake of that.         

For example, Le Havre (2011) and Play (2011) don't have English language titles, but titles in some other languages. I am also of the opinion that many English language titles are quite bad.   


And for you, it seems that you are more interesting in making a fuzz about things than actually discussing and/or talking about the movies themselves. I'm not breaking against any rules and can't see the problem. If you are interested in the English language titles, you are free to look them up for yourself. 




  Not at all. I love movies and am very impressed.    

So you believe me now? Hah.        

 Like, how many movies came out in 1893?      

http://www.imdb.com/year/1893/    

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1893_in_film   

Both IMDb and Wikipedia only have two movies each listed from that year. But this was at a very early stage of the history of film, which probably says quite much about it.    

 You must have a wealth of historical knowledge if you've seen that diversity of movies.    

Well, I guess so! I think it's great to have so many references to work with if you go through the history of film by each year in a similar way. It also helps you a lot when watching movies overall. I try to pick up as much as I can about cinema. If one has some kind of interest in films, I think it's important to try and watch different kind of films as much as you can, from every decade and from all countries you can find movies from. Even if you don't like everything, it makes your own experiences and references only richer. As I said before, I didn't entirely know if I actually had missed a year before I looked at it a little closer.     

 May l ask what decade of your life you're in?     

I was born in 1988, if that's what you are wondering about. I'll be turning 27 this year.      




 They even missed one of the best ones, Je t'aime, je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais. 




  1966 - I have practically no interest in westerns and 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' seems to be the only notable film that came out that year.     


You should see it though. I know many people who weren't at all into the Western genre, but absolutely loved that movie. It's quite universal and easy to like. A real classic. Leone's Western movies were quite different from American Western movies, like those by Howard Hawks, John Ford etc.       

And the only notable film? Oh, I would disagree on that. Two of my all-time favourites came out that year, Andrey Rublyov (1966) by Andrei Tarkovsky and Tanin no kao (1966) by Hiroshi Teshigahara. Both are masterpieces. The first one being Tarkovsky's massive epic about the great fifteenth-century Russian iconographer, but also a movie about a dark time in the history of Russia. The other one is an amazing and complex exploration about identity that is partly science fiction.           


Here'e eight other notable films from the year that are very good:     


* Au hasard Balthazar (1966) *(Robert Bresson)*       
* Blowup (1966) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*    
* Dai-bosatsu tge (1966) *(Kihachi Okamoto)*    
* La battaglia di Algeri (1966) *(Gillo Pontecorvo)*    
* Onna no naka ni iru tanin (1966) *(Mikio Naruse)*      
* Persona (1966) *(Ingmar Bergman)*    
* Taiji ga mitsury suru toki (1966) *(Kji Wakamatsu)*       
* Tobenai chinmoku (1966) *(Kazuo Kuroki)*    

A film like Persona (1966) is of course totally essential if you have the least interest in cinema. And for example, I feel like a movie such as Tobenai chinmoku (1966) is extremely forgotten and/or overlooked. It deserves more attention, I would rank it as one of the best Japanese movies of all time. 




 Here's my ten favourites from the 1980s:       

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989) *(Michael Haneke)*    
2. Krhozat (1988) *(Bla Tarr)*     
3. A Zed   Two Noughts (1985) *(Peter Greenaway)*        
4. Paris, Texas (1984) *(Wim Wenders)*       
5. Shoah (1985) *(Claude Lanzmann)*    
6. Blue Velvet (1986) *(David Lynch)*     
7. Tsuit no zawameki (1988) *(Yoshihiko Matsui)*      
8. Down by Law (1986) *(Jim Jarmusch)*       
9. Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) *(Konstantin Lopushanskiy)*     
10. Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) *(Wim Wenders)*     




  Now I guess the question is, what should I watch from 1917?    

Umirayushchii lebed (1917) by Yevgeni Bauer! The English title is The Dying Swan. I think he's a director from the silent days that really needs more recognition. If I remember correctly, the movie is also available on YouTube. A very beautiful little melodrama with a great dance sequence and a captivating story. Bauer also had some interesting techniques when it came to tinting and double exposures. Do not miss this! Probably my favourite film of the ones before the 1920s.    

Also, two honorable mentions are Tsen frn Stormyrtorpet (1917) and Terje Vigen (1917), both directed by Victor Sjstrm. 




  The topic clearly doesn't concern you.    

I didn't know that from the start. That's why I went through all the films I had seen, because I wanted to see if there was a year that I missed. I'm sorry if I made you upset or anything. It felt bad to not answer after all the hard work of looking up all the statistics of the films I have watched.         

I was actually expecting a lot more users that had watched something from every year, I'm quite surprised over how many here actually have some years missed. I'm not saying that in a bad way, because there's a lot of great suggestions in the thread, and hopefully someone will discover something nice. 




 First of all, no. I watch films from all over the world. Of all the films I have seen, English language films are even the ones dominating the list.    

I never acted like anything is superior to anything. I just made a list without the movies OP mentioned. That the ones I liked the most happen to be in Hungarian, Korean, Swedish or French, that's totally irrelevant. It's not the same thing as ignoring something. It's you yourself that's putting all the focus on the language, not me. I care about the film, not the language. Also, English is not my main language, so what's foreign to you might not be that foreign for me. Sorry if I ruined your conception of the world or anything, but when you talk like the way you do, it seems that you are acting as if English language films would be superior, so I don't really know what you want to get out of this discussion. Maybe you want me to change my taste all for you? I that case, I'm not doing it, I'm just being honest. Too bad people mistake honesty for something else. 




 Well, too bad for you. I don't get why it would be hard to believe. I don't really know what you wanted to say with your comment either. Do you want me to prove it to you somehow? Or are you just trying to make fun? Do you want me to excuse myself because I like watching movies? If you knew me, then you probably wouldn't write anything like that. But I guess it's easy having your own ideas about people you don't know on the Internet. 




 Stntang (1994). 




  Most cynical: Funny Games    

Haneke actually said something interesting regarding movies and cynicism that I agree with:     

*"Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that's ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience."* 




 Sorry if I dissapoint you, but after looking at the list of the films I have watched, I seem to have seen films from every single year in the history of cinema. There doesn't seem to be any available films made earlier than 1887 according to IMDb and Wikipedia, so that's what I came down to. Now I can't answer your question of what I want to see the most either, hah. 




 My choice would be Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz. 




  1) Do you agree with these 10 movies being selected as the best of the decade so far?        

I agree about The Act of Killing (2012). The rest? Not at all. I should add that I haven't seen Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) yet, but if I know myself good enough, I don't think it will make it on my list either.

 2) If you could do a top 10 list not counting these movies, what would it be?      

I think it would look like this together with my ratings if I remove The Act of Killing (2012):    

1. Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) *(Lav Diaz)* 4/5        
2. A torini l (2011) *(Bla Tarr)* 4/5           
3. Book chon bang hyang (2011) *(Hong Sang-soo)* 4/5          
4. Amour (2012) *(Michael Haneke)* 4/5          
5. Da-reun na-ra-e-suh (2012) *(Hong Sang-soo)* 4/5           
6. Le Havre (2011) *(Aki Kaurismki)* 4/5             
7. Dupa dealuri (2012) *(Cristian Mungiu)* 4/5          
8. Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011) *(Asghar Farhadi)* 4/5          
9. Loong Boonmee raleuk chat (2010) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)* 3/5           
10. Play (2011) *(Ruben stlund)* 3/5         




 Some suggestions:    

* Clo de 5  7 (1962) (Paris, France)      
* Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) (Berlin, Germany or West Germany if you will)      
* Do the Right Thing (1989) (Brooklyn, New York, USA)       
* L'immortelle (1963) (Istanbul, Turkey)              
* Manhattan (1979) (Manhattan, New York, USA)             
* Mystery Train (1989) (Memphis, USA)               
* Onna ga kaidan wo agaru toki (1960) (Tokyo, Japan)     
* Shinjuku dorob nikki (1969) (Tokyo, Japan)   
* Stroszek (1977) (Wisconsin, USA)             
* Tsuit no zawameki (1988) (Osaka, Japan)          









 Suna no onna (1964) by Hiroshi Teshigahara. I think the movie captured the core of the novel by Kb Abe perfectly, especially the absurdity and meaninglessness of our existance and the overall feel the book had and all the situations. Abe also collaborated with Teshigahara. The music by Takemitsu was amazing as well. 




 There's only 11 films from India in the collection if you look it up on the website, so it isn't that many. And three of them belong to the Eclipse Series 40: Late Ray. A direct link when using the search function:   

http://www.criterion.com/library/expanded_view?c=India p=1      

Anyways, I would recommend Jalsaghar (1958) by Satyajit Ray, that's my favourite film by him. A masterpiece. Beautiful and tender cinematography, interesting portrayal of the main character and wonderful music. Charulata (1964) and Mahanagar (1963) by Ray are great as well. I can add that the Eclipse box set that includes the Ray films is worth looking into too. All three of the films in that box are good, especially Ghare-Baire (1984).     

I haven't seen the films by Ismail Merchant, Zafar Hai and James Ivory that are out of print, but these aren't maybe one hundred percent Indian because of the collaboration with UK and USA. Then there's Monsoon Wedding (2001) by Mira Nair, but I haven't seen that one either. I actually missed it when it aired on TV some weeks ago. 




 It looks like Samuel isn't going to take it anymore. 




 Well, there's subtitles (at least in English) available for all of them, sure. 




 Not a single one? Wow, then I'll say you have some great flicks to discover!

 Here's my top ten:

2. Andrey Rublyov (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*         
3. L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*

10. Stntang (1994) *(Bla Tarr)*     




 Andrzej Zulawski probably. And hopefully. It was fifteen years ago his last movie came out, now he's back to filmmaking again. His new movie Cosmos (2015) seems to be completed too, so I'm looking forward to that. I really like Possession (1981) that he directed, great one. 




 Not really surprising, it seems quite bad. 




 I think it was when I just stumbled upon L'eclisse (1962) by Michelangelo Antonioni on a film site. By that time, I had not seen so many older movies. And I decided to give it a go. I just loved it. It had a whole different film language than I was used to. Afterwards, I looked up the other two Antonioni films in his alienation trilogy and saw those two as well. I also started to read more about film in general, about different directors, film history, cinematography etc. I guess it was that particular film that hooked me. I remember that Robert Bresson also was a big part of it. I started to read film essays, looking up important and essential films and so on. Slowly, all of this changed the way I looked at cinema overall and I started absorbing all the information I could get my hands on. 




 M (1931) is a German movie. And if you want to be fair, The Third Man (1949) is a British flick. But M (1931) is the only movie in the list that isn't an English language movie.

 I haven't actually seen that one yet, I only know of it. I have to go through the Truffaut films I have left soon. It was quite long ago I actually saw one of his movies. 




 * Cra cuervos (1976) (Carlos Saura)    
* Den-en ni shisu (1974) (Shji Terayama)     
* Dong dong de jia qi (1984) (Hou Hsiao-hsien)    
* Ivanovo detstvo (1962) (Andrei Tarkovsky)     
* Khane-ye doust kodjast? (1987) (Abbas Kiarostami)    
* Les quatre cents coups (1959) (Franois Truffaut)     
* Pather Panchali (1955) (Satyajit Ray)    
* The Go-Between (1970) (Joseph Losey)   


I picked out eight of my favourites around the whole concept of childhood. I also tried to get it quite diverse. Saura deals with a child fascinated by death as well as a story that uses Franco's dictatorship to give it even more depth. Terayama's film is quite psychedelic and about a very unhappy childhood. Hsiao-hsien's Taiwanese picture explores relations in the family, meanings and responsibilities when it comes to grownups through the eyes of children. Tarkovsky's war film focuses on how a child can experience war and the dreams that come up in that situation. Kiarostami's movie is about expectations that come from the adult world and a little bit of the friendship of children. When it comes to Truffaut, you already mentioned it yourself. I just put it in my list because it's still one of my favourites and one of the most important ones, a great flick about what can happen to a boy who is left without attention from his own parents. Then you have Ray's beautiful and poetic movie about poverty and how it is to grow up with dreams in rural India. And finally, Losey's period drama that deals with a young boy stuck between two different adults and how it affects him. 




 * 8 (1963)      
* Le mpris (1963)     
* Nun va Goldoon (1996)       




 Many ideas can be good. And this particular one can be interesting. But it all comes down to how you execute the idea and what you want to say with it, that's the important part. I think that's the aspect one should put first. I haven't seen the movie, so I can't say anything about that, just that the execution is the most important thing, not only the bare essentials of the idea. If you are wondering whether or not it's a good idea to put in motion in real life, I would say no. It would probably cause more damage than anything good. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989) by Michael Haneke. But one should also know that the list is for example a bit corrupted concerning the votes. Some people use only 1 and 10, people form groups to vote up/against certain movies, many vote up newer movies like crazy, certain users rate movies they haven't even seen, every Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account and start voting etc. And it's based pretty much on popularity too. So it should always be taken with a big pinch of salt, I just like to point that out. 




 Indeed. I didn't plan on getting the Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman box set some months ago, but I just couldn't hold myself because of the price it had during the last sale. 




 The best ones in your list:       

 Tokyo Story, La Jetee/Sans Soleil, A Woman Under the Influence, Taste of Cherry, Ballad of Narayama, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, My Winnipeg        

Good/worth picking up:         

 Black Narcissus, Gomorrah, Good Morning, The Great Dictator, La Haine, Harlan County, USA, The Killing, Lonesome, Love Streams, The Red Shoes, Rosetta, Safety Last!, The Gold Rush, 12 Angry Men, Make Way for Tomorrow, The Thin Red Line, Yi Yi    

Not my taste, but still worth seeing:     
 La Cienega    

When it comes to The Complete Jacques Tati, this is probably one of the better chances when it comes to box sets, you'll get it fairly cheap. I'm not a die hard fan of Tati, but if you like him, it's a good opportunity to invest in the box. I haven't seen the ones I left out, so I can't say much about them.  









 Repulsion (1965) by Roman Polanski. 




 I think those people that talk about those things mostly aren't that interested in cinema overall and/or look at movies with a single-sided approach. Of course, actors and such is one thing, but caring that much about awards and box office is quite irrelevant. For me, I never care about how much money a film made, that makes no difference for me, that's probably the last thing I care about. If you ask me, I can't even point out a single correct answer on how much money certain movies actually made, that's just not interesting for me. If a film by a director you like was a financial disaster, it probably can ruin the director to the point that the person can't do any more movies, but that's another thing knowing about than for example putting too much focus on the exact numbers.     

Also, I have a hard time taking the Academy Awards too seriously, it's just some popular and superficial circlejerking that doesn't actually put the important things about cinema as an artform in the spotlight. The circlejerking Academy Awards people seem to care more about clothes and looks. On the other hand, I've never cared too much about awards in general. Anyways, I have to agree with you, too many seem to care about what you are mentioning, which is a bit sad.     




 I think you should look into films made by actual Arabs, that way you won't find the portrayal as typical Western as many Western movies tend to be. I'm not saying that all movies that aren't done by Arabs have that certain portrayal, just that you get another picture of the whole thing if it's films made by non-Western directors.      

DIFF made an interesting list that could be good to look into:

 L'eclisse (1962) has one of my favourite endings. But I think you have to see the whole movie to get the context of it, which probably is the same with many other great endings. 









 Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer, Brian Levant, and Dennis Dugan. 




 You probably mean Marmoulak (2004) by Kamal Tabrizi? 




 Wu wu mian (2015) by Tsai Ming-liang. 




 Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974), she's simply amazing in that movie. 




 Why do you think that? It would rather be strange otherwise. I think it's just maybe you that didn't like some of the movies. I didn't like Chappie (2015) either, but you also have to remember that this list is made by several persons, which probably explains why it's so diverse. 




 You also have Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais. A good one. 




 Some good ones. Here's three of my favourites from Iran I would like to recommend:       

* Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) (Abbas Kiarostami)       
* Nun va Goldoon (1996) (Mohsen Makhmalbaf)      
* Tabiate bijan (1974) (Sohrab Shahid Saless)
