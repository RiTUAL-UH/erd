 Enemy.

In 1944, thats all we were told. The Nazis were enemies to the United States and had to be eliminated. Our generals never spoke about the families they had, the dreams the sought, or the way they bled just like us. No, they were enemies. 

Now, I stare into the eyes of a man who took my last breath; a man who beat me until I screamed for mercy yet he would not deliver it. This same man, he now stood in front of me handing over a two Euro coin for a carton of milk. 

His once rigid face and sharp eyes had aged into a sad, helpless stare. His hands shook, and his legs struggled to hold the weight of his aging body. The hands that once delivered a bullet into my head, were now outstretched handing me a coin. 

After staring for a moment too long, I took the coin and handed him his milk. I knew him, but to him, I was just another supermarket clerk. 

I watched him walk out the door, letting my grudges escape me.

A painless bullet took my life, but pain and suffering by the hands of age would take his.

Growing up in the South this is all I could think of.

Apologies, I'm out of town and didn't have a lot of time or a sketchbook. 




 No I am a big burly man who loves you. Look at my picture.
