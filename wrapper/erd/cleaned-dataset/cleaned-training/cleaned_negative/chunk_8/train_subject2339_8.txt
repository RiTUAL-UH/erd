 Another fun fact this might cause the moon to start moving closer to the earth instead of farther away as it is now. 




 ULA inherited their rockets from from Lockheed Martin and Boeing.  Rockets are most unreliable when the designs are new so by the time ULA was made most of the kinks had been worked out.   




 The Dragon Did not so much eject, as it was torn loose.   




 There cargo capsule is not equipped with a launch escape system. 




 Pluto is round so it would appear that the northern hemisphere is darker for some reason. 




 It sounds like the guy is not very cautious with his guns. 




 I don't think this is a roo. 




 I don't think it is a roo  I am surprised the mods have not caught it.

The joke is the guy was complaining about not seeing any Kangaroos in Austrailia when actually all he was doing was going to the Australian server of the game.

Not a roo, maybe enough people have linked now that they kind of need to leave it. 




 thats not a swicharoo

I started following a link a few weeks ago i stop and bookmark the page and pick it up again later.  I am only 4 months back so far.  A friend tells me that is speeds up the farther back you go though.

 It seems that you are right 

http://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3bfhwp/from_americaspace_2_inside_sources_say_spacex_f9/cslpjdk

Just confirmed. 




 lol oops Guess they are not using that source again. 




 Yea that seems reasonable 




 Yea who knows the fix could have worked fine and something else unrelated caused the tanks to over pressurize. 




 I don't know that seems like something that is really predictable.  Also smashing into LOX tank would likely cause a breach leading to loss of pressure. 




 I think that this might be getting blown out of proportion.  A lot of times you can make something sound bad when it really isn't.  If NASA signed off on this fix, I am tempted to believe they thought it was a reasonable way to fix the problem.  

Here is an example of another way you could write this.  

* Insider says that cracks in the tank liner came up occasionally.  They would fix problem by applying a layer of teflon to the area in order to prevent cracks from spreading.

When you word it like that it sounds a lot less like shoddy workmanship and a lot more like legitimate repair practice.  

Even if they were doing this we don't now that this was the cause.  Elon said that it was an over pressurization event.   




 I think up until you hear stage 1 FTS safe, it could still explode.  But it is not clear whether there is a seperate signal for both stage 1 and 2. 




 It would be interesting if this had happened 20 seconds later after MECO and stage 1 separation.  I wonder if stage 1 would still have been able to go in for a landing. 




 I would guess not significantly since this was a problem with the second stage.  But that is just my guess.

Edit: if there is a launch in August.  It is likely they may push back land landings for a couple more launches. 




 Wow dragon lived after explosion!!! 




 We are getting some good questions now 




 yea gwynn is not talking about the inter stage though. 




 It sounds like the news conference is basically saying relax everyone calm down there is no reason to believe this is going to cause dire problems. 




 It seems like the press conference is basically saying everybody calm down.  No reason to think this will have drastic consequences.  




 Can you link 




 [The one of Toph](http://i.imgur.com/v0aA5ZZ.jpg) is epic  




 Yea I like seeing ATLA content 




 lol I love that video 




 I check in. 




 you mean the big red explode button FTS 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcU4t6zRAKg 




 There are no Super Dracos on the Dragon 1 




 Is it supposed to do that? 




 I think you are right.   




 I thought that too but I don't think it actually was.  Some launches look slower than others. 




 Is there any reason it would not be able to open the parachutes?
 




 Wow you can totally see it here thanks for this upload 




 it happens like that 




 sprakles? 




 Spacex FM :) 




 where was the barge? 




 Dude that skill is really marketable.  And it is a skill there is no way I could do that. 




 **The Martian, by Andy Weir** 




 That Would be interesting.  The funny thing is Korra is really almost a Fire bender or Earth bender at heart, not a water bender. 




 He also does it in some earlier episodes. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/3b3ce0/no_spoilers_a_look_at_the_new_exclusive_art_print/csizegx 




 That would be cool, but i am talking about "The Rift" age Aang and team Aang teaming up with Book 4 Korra and team Korra. 




 I wish that Aang and Korra Could some how exist at the same time.  They would be a great team.  And team Aang and team Korra together could beat anyone. 














 I did't catch that. 




 oops 




 My first thought was i didn't know they made warthogs that early.  Then I realized it was a B-24.

Edit:B-25 




 More sand underwater means basically no island.  The islands will shrink to a size where the salt spray kills all the plants and then the rest erodes away. 




 I think that it might not be able to keep up with a sudden sea level rise though 




 maybe not politically but with sea level rise it is only going up from here. 




 by that logic they should have disappeared a long time ago.   




 Can you post this at /r/New_Horizons? 




 you should post this over at /r/New_Horizons  




 i have question.  Why don't we begin to pump sand to raise the outer banks?  we would only need to raise them by about 1-2 feet for the near future.  It is not unprecedented I have heard about them doing it to fix storm damage to beaches and even refill a whole [inlet](http://refugeassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pea-island-inlet-tom-macken.jpg). 




 Any idea why JRTI got decommissioned? 




 it really shows you how stretched everything is at the poles with Africa just getting weird at the bottom. 




 Wow it looks like the [Game of Thrones intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8PKcNGcuI) 














 Wait so is this a completely different barge? 




 Yes I understand what you are saying.  I think the reason people see hubris as a dangerous trait is that being overly confident can put you into dangerous situations. Someone who does not want to admit that they are in over their head is dangerous, but i would say someone who does not realize they are in over their head is even more dangerous.  It is also because even the best pilot in the world our still susceptible to the mechanical failures and limitations of the airplane.  I think people say that over confidence is a dangerous attitude because often times it comes with cockiness and the "nothing can hurt me" mentality. 




 I am not saying that it is unsafe to get it in low hours I was saying its not something you should boast about.  From his other comments it sounds like that was not his intention. 




 I just responded to the other comment.  I read the whole thing and it is not clear that is what you were trying to say. 

Also you did not say, where di you get trained? 




 I did read the whole comment.  I can't tell what your tone is, but from my end the comment makes you sound boastful and full of yourself.  If i were you i would go back and make it more clear what you are getting at in your first comment.  




 You have to upload a video of this. 




  Plenty of pilots who are not celebs are naturally gifted at everything, I feel the need to brag that I passed my PPL in one hobs unit past minimum... one and only that one because of some stupid twat in circuit delaying me! Yes, I was the smug star pupil, and I loved it.

Just giving you a tip, bragging about how you got your PPL right at 40 hour is a pretty stupid thing to brag about.  Nobody will think that you are a better pilot for saying so, and the fact that you are bragging about it will only reflect badly on you and your judgment.  

Getting your PPL close to 40 hours is more luck than anything, and training more than 2-3 times a week.  Many people just don't have the time and money to train at that pace.  The fact that you blame "some stupid twat in circuit" for you not getting in at exactly 40 hours further reflects badly upon you as a pilot.

Just wondering where did you get your training? 




 You said it.  That is the kind of attitude that gets you killed 




 I think the on problem is these go better und success kid and success penguin.  But good luck. 









 looks like MIB 3 














 soon they will start trying to organize volunteers to help clean up the beaches.

 I recall seeing something, it may be wikipedia, that gave the kilometers per pixel.  Ill see if i can find it.

Edit: Here it is https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=New_Horizons#Pluto_flyby  looks like the quality should be similar to the moon with Hubble. 









 Wow that is cool.  I just looked up his name, did not realize who he was. 




 I am looking for some sort of app that would allow you to edit street names and atributes on your smartphone.  It would be extremely helpful because you could add feature data, like if there is a sidewalk what the surface is like, and the street name, while you are actually there.  Is there anything like this? 




 Its funny Aang's head actually looks proportional. 




 What does IIRC stand for? 




 A gyrocopter that small does not need to be licensed and you don't need a pilots license to fly one.  Ultralight aircrafts have a lot less regulation than normal aircrafts. 




 You can violate TFRs by accident 




 I don't think he was attempting to disguise himself.  You should watch this Tampa Bay Times video.  http://video.tampabay.com/A-special-delivery-for-Congress-28895951 









 download a proxy extension for chrome it fixes said problem 




 Thanks this is exactly what i was looking for. 




 I sense strong sarcasm with this one. 




 No she has survived other times she should have been burned.  The most recent when was when she flew off on Dragon.  Ser Barastian says that the dragon blew fire on her and as she was flying off he could see her hair on fire.  I think she even mentions that she lost her hair in the chapter of her in the wastelands with Dragon. 




 Please link so we can guess who it is. 




 I feel like this is where the FDA needs to step in.  There is no reason why a Pacemaker that is susceptible to this problem should be allowed to be put in someone.  If there is interference, than obviously your pacemaker needs to be redesigned. 




 Does this account for how much freight they are moving?  I am sure if you had semi trucks moving all that freight the pollution would be even worse. 




 This article seems to ignore basic facts, Like when you pollute a river, nobody lives near it, and the land is essentially worthless so nobody is going to bother spending money to defend it.  

It also ignores common resources that are impossible to regulate with a pure market, like the air, or oceans.  I think anti government conservatives and libertarians who think the world would be a Utopia without government regulation, should go to Mexico.

I love Mexico, but they have serious problems with water quality and air quality.  In many cases this is due to there being much less regulation.  In many places raw sewage goes directly in to rivers and streams, along with industrial chemicals from factories.  If you are within 100 feet of the river you can smell it.  In the US we Used to do this exact same thing, in fact there are even some crazy stories about [Rivers catching on fire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Cuyahoga_River#Environmental_concerns)  But around the 70s and 80s we decided that it was time to start taking care of our country.  We created things like the EPA in order to regulate things that are damaging to the environment in order to make the US a better place to live.

Here is another example with the air.  Do you like to exercise outside going on bike rides and runs though your city?  I do too, and when i did it in a city in Mexico my lungs would usually start to develop a burning sensation by the time I was done exercising.   But what is a little burning?  Exercise hurts a little right?  Well after doing that for a couple months in a city in Mexico, I started to developed a cough that would not go away.  It was almost like a smokers cough.  

Long story short.  I get back to the US where we have stricter regulations in order to protect air quality.  What do you know after a week or two with some good air those problems just magically went away.  

Most conservatives seem to want it both ways they love that they can swim in rivers and lakes and breath fresh air, but then they want to get rid of the very organizations that have made those things possible.

PS: I just want to say I love Mexico! it is a great place and they are improving so much.  But it is still a good case study to see what a place is actually like when there is less government regulation to protect common resources.

Edit:  My first Gold :)  Thank you kind stranger. 




 ah ye of little faith.  

There are tons of ways that she could get to Westeros.  In fact I think GRRM has been laying the groundwork to get her there.  GRRM Dropped a whole fleet of ships right at her doorstep with the iron islanders.  He is now giving her a means to beat the iron islanders with the new Kahl.  all she has to do is gain control of the Dothraki.  My bet is she is going to go back to the womb of the world convince all of the Dothraki to follow her in the biggest Kahl ever and then lead them to Maureen.  Or something along those lines.

She has also had problems controlling her Dragons.  But GRRM just added the plot device of the Giant dragon controlling horn.  The one problem is it kills whoever uses it by burning them.  But We have already been shown on multiple occasions that Danerys can not be burned, so when she uses it, it may give her control of her dragons without killing her.

Also GRRM has brought together quite a few major characters in Maureen.  it makes sense that he has brought them together so they can depart with Danerys.  Almost all the major characters in the area have come together at Mareen.   




 Does anyone know where to find a frame by frame of the CRS 6 landing?  During the explosion things fly by the camera so fast that you can't tell whats going on. 




 That may be helpful.  I think it is so cool that if you do something cool enough in this community you get flair for it.  Like the guy who made the website that simulates launches. 




 I feel like are data sets are somewhat limited lol. 









 I did not realize you were referring to the article oops. 




 Its easy to call other people out for their mistakes, but stuff happens all the time.  People are human and make mistakes.  

It could be as simple as a miscommunication between two pilots while fueling the plane.

It would be short sighted to think that you will go though your aviation career without having or narrowly avoiding similar mistakes.   




 I think its time to stop feeding the dog, doggy treats.  It looks like he has a bit of a weight and balance problem lol. 




 And two broken legs.  What a great deal. 




 What is the pilot in command doing in the right seat?  is the lady getting training or something?

 That is the job of unions which the airlines have done an excellent job of weakening. 




 Unions would fix this problem. 




 It would be fun small rockets are tough though.  No room for error. 




 Normally it doesn't form until behind the tail.  Thats probably why you have not seen it. 




 They still could have made it more interesting and Avatar is supposed to have influences from Asian fighting styles and it is fun to watch.   




 The earth King has invited you to [Lake Laogai](https://www.reddit.com/r/LakeLaogai).  

More seriously though I son't think the movie affected the show that much.  It seems like for the most part they have ignored it.  But there is no doubt that the martial arts and more creative fighting bending and choreography was missing from Korra.  The only thing that got close to TLA style bending was Wan in beginnings pt 1 and 2
