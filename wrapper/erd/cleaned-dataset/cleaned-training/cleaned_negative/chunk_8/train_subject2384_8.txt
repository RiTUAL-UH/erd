 I like the UX of it which may seem superficial but it is very important when you're searching. One of the quickest ways to frustrate someone with a search tool is by making it confusing just to use.

So far as the search, I typed in Mario Brothers 2 (looking for the 1980s game, NOT any current Wii, NDS or Gameboy games) and every post was relevant to the game I was looking for. Many search algorithms for larger engines whether it's Yahoo or Youtube (which doesn't have a good search function) do not work as well. If you type Mario Brothers 2 at Youtube, the top 10 items that come up are the aforementioned newer games.

While those with programming knowledge may have better insight, personally it works well for me.
