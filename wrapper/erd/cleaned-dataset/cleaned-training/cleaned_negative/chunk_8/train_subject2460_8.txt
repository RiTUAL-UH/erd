 Martin Scorsese ends the film with a shot of the New York skyline which includes the World Trade Center Towers, even though the film was finished after the buildings were destroyed in the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Scorsese chose to end on that shot rather then continue with a skyline without the WTC because the movie is supposed to be about the people who build New York, not those who tried to destroy it.

 The main two I experience in the Washington, DC area are these:  Guy approaches you on the metro or a popular tourist spot, says he is in the armed services on leave, had his wallet stolen, and needs some money to buy a bus ticket to get home to see his family.  In the areas outside of DC, Silver Spring, Bethesda, Arlington, there is always people that run up to you, usually well dressed, claim their car broke down, and need money for a tow.  They always run up to you pretending to be out of breathe, and always claim and try to provide evidence that they have a job.
