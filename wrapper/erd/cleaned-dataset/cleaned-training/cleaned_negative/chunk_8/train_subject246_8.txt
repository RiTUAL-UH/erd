 Just some subtle tweaks in light room but no filters

 yes vacant - as in not yet abandoned, but empty and no longer in use 




 Thanks, I'm in Ontario Canada.  you? 














 I don't add filters but I do often work with shadows, highlights etc to get my desired look and feel.  This was a dark room with a large window that provided a perfect amount of natural light - it's likely a combination of all these elements that make it look that way. 




 I dont do HDR 














 HAH, FOR SURE! 



















 Second Pic you may enjoy

 west end 














 right? 





























 You take a tuft of steel wool and place it inside a wire wisk, the wire wisk is attached to a rope or string

you set up the camera for a long exposure, light the steel wool and  spin the wisk - and you get this! 




 yay!!!!!! 







































 You "word nazi's" on Reddit kill me!!!!  Church, Cathedral...how the fuck do I know!!!  lol

Thanks for all the comments, upvotes and interaction! 














 Oh and it's Fisher Body, not Packard. 




 It's just a picture man, no need to over-think it.  When and where did I ever state that this was new and groundbreaking?  

People will continue to flock to Detroit for the same old shit, just like I have, and will again. 




 adding one ray, ya good one. 




 Oh, and what is your preference, birds...trees, pretty shots of nature...of wait, how about frozen waterfalls?  That sounds like SO much fun!!! 














 hahaha yes, he does!  good eye 




 I'm a total exclamation point whore!! 




 lolol good one!!! 




 I am jealous as mother fuck right now!

Great set my friend! 




 I do, but they aren't posted yet 




 A google search will give you enough results with names and addresss!! 




 No doubt, I always come to Detroit with a crew.  Not that that would stop something from happening, but it lessens the chances I think 














 Thank you! 














 very cool 




 funnily enough, it had raccoon poop in it 




 hahahaha

 Thank You!

 Its no big thing,  i catch grief no matter what i post. Lol ...this IS The internet and is always to be expected.   I just thought some baseball fans might dig the shot!! 




 It's called "still life", I'm not interested in pointing my lens at a floor full of shit and garbage and call it a photograph. I like to search out odds and ends in these places and capture them. 




 I should have used different wording, "well used" maybe?? 




 sorry - it LOOKS old!! 



















 Before you ask/comment - yes I set this shot up, hard to shoot something that is buried under rubble!

 I CERTAINLY DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 




 I really need to see what "fallout" is because every pic I post gets some kind of a fallout related comment!!! 




 I can assure you, no one is doing shit to this house!!!!

Great fucking username BTW!!!! 




 lolol!!   




 Wow, I never imagined this would strike up such a debate!

I personally think "Take only pictures, leave only footprints" is one of the most annoying phrases and while I have used it in articles and blogs, I can't stand hearing it.  The only reason I used it in an article was because it was for public consumption (rather than just the exploring community) and when the general unknowing public hears something like that it gives them warm fuzzies!

I don't take stuff because I just simply don't want to, it's not mine to take so why take it.  But I don't think ill of those who do, who am I to judge.  It's just that simple for me, no need to over analyze the subject IMO.  I'm just there to take pictures

HOWEVER, the one thing I WISH I would have taken but didn't??

 hahaha - you must be a pleasant person to have a conversation with.  Oh no - someone sets up photos, what a fucking idiot, who does he think he is!!!!!

For the record, this was like this when I found it, not to say someone else didn't set this shot up.

I will await your crusty internet bad-ass reply!
