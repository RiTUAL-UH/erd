  we would still be left with a highly disproportionate kill-rate.

I think that you mean disproportionate kill-numbers. Because when kill-rates are calculated (as described in the 1st paragraph of the Discussion section of the 2000 CDC study), then pit bull fatalities are not disproportionate compared to other large breeds:

1. Malamute: 15 fatalities  20 years  50,000 dogs = 0.015-per-1,000

2. Husky: 21  20  680,000 = 0.0015-per-1,000

3. Rottweiler: 44  20  1.9M = 0.0012-per-1,000

4. Pit Bull: 76  20  4.6M = 0.0008-per-1,000

5. German Shepherd: 27  20  2.5M = 0.0005-per-1,000

 Sorry, no. 




 I think it's debatable whether there's been no significant rise in number of victims of mass shootings. It's a point convincingly argued by Northeastern's [James Alan Fox](http://hsx.sagepub.com/content/18/1/125.short) but also convincingly counter-argued by Harvard's [David Hemenway](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/mass-public-shootings-increasing-in-us/). I think it's more to the point that even Fox concedes that mass shootings have been a stable phenomenon for the past 20-30 years, which contradicts your implied argument that violence is on the decline (by citing gun homicide rates) and instead supports /u/djroomba__'s argument that "these killings will not stop."

Now if you want to argue against /u/djroomba__'s opinion that changes to gun laws   mental health care will reduce the frequency and number of victims of mass shootings, be my guest. Because as far as I'm aware, such conjecture is typically based on qualitative comparisons between policies in the USA vs. other countries and not on any scientific research.

 As indicated in the [Rules for Submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules), "peer-reviewed research means the research is published in a scholarly journal which practices the peer-review system." I see no evidence that reviews published by Cochrane are themselves peer-reviewed. If you can provide a link on the Cochrane web site that indicates their reviews are peer-reviewed, then I'll be happy to reinstate the submission.

 I think that /u/djroomba__ might be talking about something different than you.

  Around 60% of dog attacks in the world are pit bulls only.

Do you have a scientific source that supports this claim or are you just exaggerating? The CDC found that around 50% of fatalities (not attacks) in the USA (not the world) were by pit bulls. The CVMA found that less than 10% of dog attacks in Colorado were by pit bulls. I'm unaware of any scientific study that looked at dog attacks worldwide.

 They are banned in UK and New Zealand.

Pit bull-type dogs (as commonly understood in this thread) are not banned in the UK. Only purebred Pit Bull Terriers are banned by the [Dangerous Dogs Act 1991](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/65/contents). Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers and mixed breeds are all allowed in the UK. For example, [here is just one list of Stafforshire Bull Terriers available for sale to Londoners](http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/sale/dogs/staffordshire-bull-terrier/london/).

 It is also banned in parts of Canada, after which dog attacks dropped by 80%.

Do you have a source that supports this claim or are you just exaggerating? Because I think you might have your numbers backward. The Toronto Humane Society conducted a [study in 2013](http://www.torontohumanesociety.com/pdfs/Breed_Specific_Legislation_Jan-14.pdf) which found that "dog bite rates in 36 Canadian municipalities found no difference between jurisdictions with BSL and those without." In particular, the number of bites by pit bulls decreased by 98% after BSL was enacted in Ontario ([as reported by the *Toronto Star*](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/10/03/pit_bulls_were_torontos_biggest_biters_before_the_ban.html)) but the number of bites by all breeds remained essentially unchanged: [5,428 in 2005 to 5,345 in 2009](http://www.citynews.ca/2010/04/28/number-of-bites-largely-unchanged-after-pit-bull-ban/). The only reference I could find to an 80% reduction in dog bites was in Calgary (from 10-per-10,000 people in 1986 to 2-per-10,000 people in 2006) but Calgary employs strong licensing   enforcement and not BSL.

 But 1 in 10 will destroy someones life.

Do you have a source that supports this claim or are you just exaggerating? Because it seems like it's pulled out of thin air. [The Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-study-dog-attacks-and-maimings-merritt-clifton.php) indicates that pit bulls are responsible for about 115 serious attacks per year and comprise about 6.7% of the dog population, so about 5.6 million. If the average pit bull lifespan is 12-14 years, then basic math tells us that 1-in-4,000 will destroy someone's life, not 1-in-10. What are the "statistics" behind this seemingly outrageous claim?
