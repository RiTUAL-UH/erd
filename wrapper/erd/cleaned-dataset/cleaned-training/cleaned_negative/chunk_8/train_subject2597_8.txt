 Preferably in the winter  




 A win for the bucks, a win for Milwaukee  




 Yes, just not those years. Want to bring fans back to Folsom? Renew rivalries and play big name teams  




 Oregon or Arizona  




 "Most of the former brewery buildings have been redeveloped into a hotel, apartments, offices and other new uses, with more projects in the works." 









 Yes, you will see it this year. Colorado plays 13 games 
Edit- see OP edit  




 If you have any interest in getting two games in, you could do USC at CU for the Friday night espn game, then UNLV at CSU the next day. 
Edit- or AFA vs Utah St

 It's more that CSU can't get enough people  




 CSU 
Nebraska 
Oregon 
Air Force 
Arizona 
ASU 
USC 
Norte Dame 
 




 Colorado plays 5 away games in conference play so they needed another home game. Plus mile high has been empty during the games, it's hard to justify playing there  




 2020 OOC- CSU, AF, Texas A M 
2022 OOC- AF, TCU, Minnesota  




 Well CSU, this is what happens when you don't play ball. Fuck Air Force! A pretty good rivalry coming back  




 Shitty parents?  




 Can we use some funds for the birth control program? I know it got another year of private funding but this seems like a no brainer  




 Shady jobs are better than no jobs in one of the worst US cities 




 Concerts should be good there too 




 Business and jobs coming to Milwaukee? Who cares right?  









 Going with the Obama slogan? Yeah people aren't tired of that one... 




 CU just doesn't care. It might get a bit better with Folsom Frenzy but people were quick to ditch basketball after 3 straight tournament appearances.  




 [could've fooled me] (http://www.suntekstore.com/goods.php?id=10011753 utm_source=gbus utm_medium=paid) 









 Well to be fair there's 1,000 other things to do on a nice Saturday afternoon, other states can't say that  




 Stop making it $175 for season tickets.  









 Season 9 of how I met your mother  




 Hey there, looking forward to next year's game  




 Pac games  




 Ah yes, state schools have so much profit. That's why were pending debt approval to update class rooms  




 Not when the state gives very little funding. Most of my university funding comes from federal research and tuition  




 Now you know why employers love interns  




 Put the corporations on a pedestal  




 45 hours * 4 weeks is 180. $1000/180 hours = $5.55/hour.
They definitely have no obligation to give you benefits for an internship (seen as temporary employment especially if it's a summer internship) and a below minimum wage pay. Are you sure you're numbers are right?  




 Said this the last time this was posted, many people commenting this are at work  




 My university cut full time positions for students because they couldn't afford to give them benefits  




 A company wants profit? No way? That's the fucking point of business.  




 I was saying on one person but I'm a crowd  




 If you look at the Wisconsin map here you will see many seats in Milwaukee area but very large areas in the north west. We're not talking about Florida  




 EMT here. Cops don't need medical training beyond first aid/CPR. They already fuck up the little medical training they have. Their job isn't to make medical judgement, that's our job. Just like why firefighters cut people out of cars, not cops, there's a places for everyone in the system. Mess with who does what and it's a disaster. 
There's literally nothing the cops could do for a seizure. Seizures require drugs that paramedics attend years of schooling in order to gain a license to give the drugs. Best case scenario for a seizure in a crowd- move patient out from the crowd if it is safe to do so, have Medics show up, Medics treat/transport
On a side note, if you witness seizure, time how long it is and move things out of the way so the person doesn't get hurt.  




 Mom probably charged at cops when she saw the daughter 




 Spray is also worthless in small spaces or crowds  




 Or that highly populated areas that vote democrat also don't have the most districts.  




 So no hope during recall or reelection?  




 Pretty crazy how big cities vote democrat and thus get those seats but rural/majority of state area isn't necessarily Democrat  




 Because a huge amount of those votes were from the Milwaukee area. Those people vote democrat. How many districts are there in Milwaukee area versus the rest of the state?
Edit- could it also be that not every democrat voted democrat? As in, do they base those numbers off of who got a vote or what the voter identified as? I know Democrats that voted Walker because they didn't like Tammy  




 Also what brought the program down... 




 People who still can't afford insurance now have less money to eat because of fines. 




 You're crazy to think he's made much of a difference in the middle east. The recession was part of the housing crash that was caused by people buying things they can't afford, not bush. 

The health has caused premiums to rise and people who can't afford Obama care are now paying fines.  




 CSU- Last year wasn't a fluke!  




 Did you watch Colorado Utah last year? We almost pulled it off  




 Colorado Utah. Basically anyone alive for those days is old or dead now.  




 No but improving home lives and getting parents involved in education will help  




 Keep a kitchen open and sell food. 




 So did Obama, where is he on his promises?  




 Well he did get elected twice and win a recall.  




 Because [increased spending on education doesn't increase performance] (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=967656)

Edit- downvoted for citing a study! Reddit at its finest  




 It's interesting everyone's picking those pac games. We should've have beat UCLA last season if sefo spiked the ball, OT against Cal, I think 500 yards against ASU which was more than them. I would say we win 1 of the WSU OSU games and one other 
You're also missing a game, we play 13 




 Go through all the steps and add it to your protocols. Be ready with numbers showing how many drunks are transported unnecessarily and how much money/time you lose

 A trip around the world of sort. From USA - Europe -  Japan - Alaska - home. Im fascinated by the fact I can go somewhere and back without crossing the same latitude twice  




 [Such a class act](http://youtube.com/watch?v=6GxJmB-bdwI) 




 Came looking for a reversed version, leaving disappointed  




 Colorado plays 13 games because of the trip to Hawaii, let's say 7-6 




 That's a completely different thing... 




 So 2am is chug time?  




 Just beat mizzou and you win the east  




 That 1-12 worst case is exaggerated. 2-11 would be absolute worst case 
I agree with a 7-6 best case but it only takes 6 to make a bowl with Hawaii as an opponent  




 Now try it at altitude, better yet with wind to your back

 People hide in shipping containers all the time. Is it that far fetched that people would do it in containers that contain human forms?

 Normal HR, RR, o2 sat, and glucose. No signs of trauma, AOx4, can walk with minimal assistance, no medications that would enhance effects of alcohol, able to protect airway, hasn't lost control of bodily fluids, has someone to get them home or be with them for a few hours. 

We get patient info, check off the boxes, have them sign it (as a contact form) and off they go.  




 You don't know where that phone has been  




 I work in a college town with lots of hobos. We have an alcohol clearance protocol  




 I've seen otherwise "don't call 911 because then they get a ticket!!!". 
 




 Just realized Nichols St wasn't showing up, fixed it that should be a win as well  




 You really think those pac teams are more likely than CSU and Hawaii? 









 Depends on the plane 




 More money to scan/search shipping containers  




 Lesson learned, USC is extremely defensive about cheating  




 Says every school, most importantly Colorado, Washington, Oregon  




 Apparently that doesn't work well. Football players are usually too big to fly  




 Especially with those liquor laws  




 Colorado
1. Weed
2. Brand new facilities 
3. Weed  




 Well, don't sell drugs (though I'm pro legalization) and don't illegally process firearms. You're defending  a guy who's shot before.  




 Sell? Smuggle. Forgive me for trying to come up with a reason. Reddit says increase taxes, apparently not on foreign goods, just those rich CEO bastards  




 That explains why Wyoming has no fans  




 I'm sorry, what part of Bush's benefits was OK?  




 If you want heart attacks without the joy of winning get watch Colorado

 Only lost to Oregon by 34 on the Road, USC isn't better than Oregon was and this game is in Boulder  




 And no dealing with rain!  









 No joke Denver is turning into LA.  




 USC Friday night espn. Get ready  




 Under grad at CU, grew up and spent many drunken nights at Wisconsin  




 Slow poke stupid question here. Are our games with SJSU part of coach Mac contract?  




 It's actually a fact that those two states are where most of our people come from. Denver population is sky rocketing and rent is unaffordable. I'm talking $1500 for one bedroom  




 It was awesome during the Boston bomber manhunt

 Preview: Beau Gamble, a former walk-on at Colorado, put together this alumni team to band together different eras of Buffaloes basketball. Gamble was able to get at least two alums at each position, including small forward Richard Roby, the programs all-time leading scorer. Colorado should have 9+ players in LA for the first weekend, and with all coming from the same system, itll end up being a tough out for Team 23.
