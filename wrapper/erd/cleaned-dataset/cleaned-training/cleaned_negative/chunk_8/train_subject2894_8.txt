 Ironically I got 14.04 because it was LTS, and so it'd be bug free.

15.04 sorted that cocksucker out with one visit. ;D flawless. And the new background looks cool too! 




 I did. xD

Ran 15.04 instead now. No issues what so ever! :)

 Just installed 15.04

Not a single damn problem. Installed FLAWLESSLY. Video drivers and adapters were found and installed automatically via Ethernet.

I'm up and running with 0 problems.
