 Drunk Cersei was one of the highlights of season 2, so I'm pretty hyped for this season. 




 I'm upgrading from an MSI GTX 670 to an MSI GTX 970 4GB, my question is that do I need to uninstall and reinstall my graphics driver for this? The issue is that when I check Nvidia's website, the graphics driver for my current GTX 670 is exactly the same as the GTX 970 I'm upgrading to?

 This ought to be good.
