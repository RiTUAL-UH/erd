 I pressed the button by accident. Lucky 13 I guess... 




 Just wondering if I should wait to buy an unlocked G3. Thanks! 




 Aww man, I just tapped the touch pad on my laptop by accident! I know how you feel pal.

 Thanks! This looks promising. 









 This question may be a little odd, but I'm looking for as many different colored shirts as possible. Long sleeve and short sleeve but no button ups. I don't want logos, patterns or pictures, just solid colors. [This] (http://cdnd.lystit.com/photos/2013/05/07/old-navy-dark-green-heather-classic-vneck-tees-product-1-8542319-185125367_large_flex.jpeg) is the type of shirt I'm describing. 

Ideally I'd like the widest selection of hues there can be so I can use them for a special project I'm working on in one of my classes.


Thanks for any help!

 John! Are you ever going to come visit New England? Maybe for a book signing/nerd fighter meetup? 




 I just bought a laptop for $200... 









 I dunno why you got downvoted,  I thought it was funny 









 I agree.  Can someone confirm the legitimacy of this? 




 I thought it might be special, oh well...

 I'm in need of a phone and this will be the first that I ever own. Due to my relatively small budget I don't have many options. I've narrowed my choices down to a used Galaxy S3 from Craigslist, or a brand new Galaxy Grand Prime from Amazon. After reviewing all the specifications for both phones I've found that the Grand Prime has an edge with almost every feature; screen size, battery life, camera resolution, weight...

The S3 does have a few things going for it though. Twice as much ram (2GB vs 1GB) and twice as much internal memory (16GB vs 8 GB). Although the internal memory shouldn't be a problem because I plan to use an SD card to expand it. The S3 also has a few extra sensors that the Grand Prime doesn't, such as a gyroscope.

One major factor that I'm considering is the fact that the S3's screen has many cracks in it, and I really would love the q-hd screen the Grand Prime has.

Thanks for any information!

TL;DR: I think the title sums it up.
