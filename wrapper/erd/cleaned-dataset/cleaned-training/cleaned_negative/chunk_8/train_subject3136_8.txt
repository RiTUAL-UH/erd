 I think you are the one misleading people.  Your original comment makes assumptions that just aren't in the article.  *"OPs title says, "and it's now being tested" to MISLEAD people to believe that this is current. It is NOT.  This is a piece of evidence that they have had for many many months and have had ample opportunity to run all of the tests being discussed in this thread. It obviously led nowhere."*  You ASSUME (mislead) that the investigation of the moist towelette in question has concluded and has led nowhere, when the article just doesn't say that at all. 




 "Sure they should have read the article, but I would think its your responsibility to know most won't."   lol

 




 So a misleading article maybe? 




 The title is the first sentence of the article.
