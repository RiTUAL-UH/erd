 Id put Concluding Unscientific Postscript near the top of the list.  




 Hillary cares.  




 People like you are the problem with this country:  Whatever works, as long as you get away with it.  Put the debt burden on our kids; we'll be dead by then.  Rah, rah, military - we must thank them for our "freedoms".  All in the name of a good investment.  

Look at Great Britain, and Rome before them.  Empires don't last because of amoral short-sighted, greedy mentality.  You can cheer for it all you want, but don't pretend it is founded on anything substantive, and certainly not on anything good.  Call it what it is:  Might makes right. 




 This isn't anything unless and until it happens.  Let us know then.  And it still won't be much of a story.

 




 Thanks for posting this! 




 That's like saying armed robbery is a very effective method of wealth reallocation, and an effective investment. 

You're thinking for the short-term, not the long term.  And you're thinking for a limited category of people, the warmongers and banksters.  If you recalibrate for the long term for all citizens, your assertion is bogus.
 




 Check the internet.  For one, she said the attack was due to an internet video, when emails/documents show she knew otherwise.  You can do the rest yourself. 




 She's not a normal person. 




 Well dont put so much in a voting populace that is lied to by their leaders and by the media, spied on by the NSA, etc. And dont claim realpolitik when these wars arent even declared by Congress, as per the Constitution. They are illegal wars.  




 War isnt good for our economic interests. It is only enriching the banksters and military industrial complex. Otherwise it is destructive and wasteful and life-ending, etc.  




 Every country is a potential treat.  




 You know damn well what he's talking about and pretending he just doesnt understand freedom in order to make a supposed point against that.  




 I was being sarcastic, and not only referring to that incident.  




 Hamilton could use a PR person.  




 Hogwash.  Rim protection over-stated?  Hardly. 




 Lame post. Such a gentleman?  




 Lame. 




 Yeah.  Riiiiiiiight. 




 If you are down on MBTI, then why care? Masterminds conveys pretty accurately what an INTJ is, in a word. There is nothing unhumble about it. We aren't bestowing it upon ourselves. Few would take it to be anything more than that. It certainly shouldn't be taken too literally or assumed to mean more than it can.  




 If a law is wrong, argue against the law. Don't argue against the "morons" who get the 3 strikes in a system designed to enrich itself off their victimless, non-violent "offenses" with perpetual imprisonment - all under the bogus cover of morality and justice, etc.  




 Reading this whole thread make me miss Al *a lot*.  Wish you were here, Al!  Rest in peace. 




 He used to live in the Oakland Airport Hilton during the season. 




 There are many thousands rotting away in California prisons for similar "offenses", due to the 3 strikes legislation. 




 Yes, it is generally acting instead of thinking/reflecting/analyzing. We do best on the move when we can enjoy and manifest and take advantage of our intuition and instinct.  




 Check out Taoism. Alan Watts' writings are a good starting point.  




 Amen.  




 A copy of Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling was sitting on the back of the toilet at my brother's place. Noticed it had a quote from a Dylan song on one of the first pages (from Highway 61). That was about 20 years ago. Was tranfixed with SK for a good decade. Have since moved on to other existentialists and Taoism most recently. It is the only real philosophy that touches everything in a person and elsewhere, because if the paradox and individualism and subjectivity of it all.  




 [Speaking of which, a proposal moving through Congress that rolls back protections for mobile home buyers would almost exclusively benefit Clayton Homes, a company controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett](http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/05/18/17348/congressional-proposal-might-only-benefit-firm-was-subject-probe) 




 Don't just do something! Stand there! 









 Nobody here really believes Brady's story, so why are you surprised that Belichick wouldn't?  Biased reporting?  That would be beside the point. 




 Give us an example.  




 assumptions like what? i assume anyone tends to tell the truth more than politicians do. further, hersh has a record of single-handedly breaking some huge stories: my lai, abu garaib, etc., that were truer than any of the powers that be cared to admit.  




 yes, that's a good book too. 




 I'd much rather take Uber than any other type of taxi.  If you're trying to scare me into supporting the current price-gouging, protected-monopoly taxi companies, it's not working. 




 nbc and the nytimes have since corroborated it.  news in pakistan has corroborated it.  you really expect him to name the source?  now you sound like an administration spokesperson.  he names the source, the source spends the rest of his life in prison.  you want propaganda, watch "zero dark thirty", or try to make sense of the many various incomplete and contradictory explanations coming from the white house.  don't you think it's bizarre they never produced any photos of bin laden's body?  obama said that's because we don't "spike the football".  hogwash.  they released the video of saddam being hung, and guadafi being killed, etc.  the pictures don't correspond to their story, that's why they weren't released. 




 the government has taken those incentives away.  i'm currently unemployed.  it's not about more jobs or less jobs.  if it was, we could dig holes and fill them up.  "it" being standard of living.  the dollar used to go further (its value has been destroyed by the fed) - that is why women have to work.  that creates bubbles which all destroys the middle class.  government and banks have to get out of the way.  read irwin schiff's piece and check out fredric bastiat's "the seen and the unseen", and murray rothbard's "what has the government done to our money?"  very short and pdf's available online. 




 They only released this now to try to discredit Seymour Hersh's latest [article](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden) which undermines the administration's whole story about the killing of OBL. 




 Most all of that is natural gas/fracking (oil) jobs. 




 ok, but if you buy into that, you're saying that only the thieves and fascists and banksters can be productive or allow us to be productive.  this only empowers them more.  government produces nothing.  banks produce nothing tangible, and usually just figure out clever ways to spend other peoples' money.  nothing productive from the rich or the powerful.  money didn't give us the productivity in silicon valley.  ingenuity in garages, etc., did. 




 Reminded me of the smiling Taoist in 'The Vinegar Tasters'. 




 Read [this](http://freedom-school.com/money/how-an-economy-grows.pdf).  Some of the most fundamental things anyone could ever learn about money and economy.

Money has nothing to do with productivity, and really doesn't have anything to do with survival.  Also, people could create their own jobs.  They shouldn't have to depend on the government or someone else to do it.  Yes, in many ways the powers that be have turned the Western world into a debt-slave culture and a dependent economy and have made it harder to get by:  predatory lending, bubbles one to the next, discouraging savings, etc.  But they have made the problem, and can't be looked to for a solution.   




 If you eat sugary fruits (like pineapple) every day, you could gain weight.  




 One good thing about wind energy (and probably other renewable sources) is that it *doesn't* require as many jobs/workers as conventional energy, freeing people up to do more productive things. Productivity is what increases the standard of living, not the number of jobs.  




 just watched it - a couple things: 

the big mike was set up and never used. took up a lot if the frane. it also looked like it could have been pre-recorded. there weren't any long shots and ony one camera was used. it seemed like very different lighting too and a strange taping compared to usual musical performances on the show.  




 Two-dimensional = dystopia? 




 Easily The Road. 

Then

Atlas Shrugged. Heart of Darkness. Brave New World.  




 This post got me reading Cannery Row today. Excellent book. The Taoist undertones are pretty cool. I know Im going to devour all of Steinbeck's stuff now. Thanks! 




 Yeah, there's enough of a Cormac-worship circle jerk here anyway. It has taken on a life of its own. This post isn't necessary. That book was out years ago.  




 You and me both. The most overrated book of all time.  




 Does anyone here like the story in this book, or any part of the content, or is it just Cormac's writing style that gets you so excited? 




 They should have at least let him *try* a 15 yard extra point.  




 yeah, it's a load of crap.  




 The word is a symbol and a delight which sucks up men and scenes, trees, plants, factories, and Pekinese. Then the Thing becomes the Word and back to Thing again, but warped and woven into a fantastic pattern. The Word sucks up Cannery Row, digests it and spews it out, and the Row has taken the shimmer of the green world and the sky-reflecting seas. Lee Chong is more than a Chinese grocer. He must be. Perhaps he is evil balanced and held suspended by goodan Asiatic planet held to its orbit by the pull of Lao Tze and held away from Lao Tze by the centrifugality of abacus and cash registerLee Chong suspended, spinning, whirling among groceries and ghosts. A hard man with a can of beansa soft man with the bones of his grandfather. For Lee Chong dug into the grave on China Point and found the yellow bones, the skull with grey ropy hair still sticking to it. And Lee carefully packed the bones, femurs, and tibias really straight, skull in the middle, with pelvis and clavicle surrounding it and ribs curving on either side. Then Lee Chong sent his boxed and brittle grandfather over the western sea to lie at last in ground made holy by his ancestors.
    
Mack and the boys, too, spinning in their orbits. They are the Virtues, the Graces, the Beauties of the hurried mangled craziness of Monterey and the cosmic Monterey where men in fear and hunger destroy their stomachs in the fight to secure certain food, where men hungering for love destroy everything lovable about them. Mack and the boys are the Beauties, the Virtues, the Graces. In the world ruled by tigers with ulcers, rutted by strictured bulls, scavenged by blind jackals, Mack and the boys dine delicately with the tigers, fondle the frantic heifers, and wrap up the crumbs to feed the sea-gulls of Cannery Row. What can it profit a man to gain the whole world and to come to his property with a gastric ulcer, a blown prostate, and bifocals? Mack and the boys avoid the trap, walk around the poison, step over the noose while a generation of trapped, poisoned, and trussed-up men scream at them and call them no-goods, come-to-bad-ends, blots-on-the-town, thieves, rascals, bums. Our Father who art in nature, who has given the gift of survival to the coyote, the common brown rat, the English sparrow, the house-fly and the moth, must have a great and overwhelming love for no-goods and blots-on-the-town and bums, and Mack and the boys. Virtues and graces and laziness and zest. Our Father who art in nature. 




 Are we still expecting a refresh/release after Skylake comes out?  Are we still expecting a body redesign similar to the 13" anytime?

Recently got my MacBook Pro stolen, and am wondering if I should hold off and wait, or buy this one now.  I could wait 6-8 months if I was somewhat certain Skylake and/or a redesign was coming. 




  Remember Al-Qaeda in Iraq was ISIS before it was rebranded.

Well done.  But I don't get the above sentence.  This is saying that ISIS already existed.  Can you provide, or link to, some history or context on this?  When did the rebranding occur?  Was *this* ISIS also created by the CIA?  Thanks. 




 I think he's in the new Mad Max movie.  









 One of my favorites lyrically for sure.  




 I think his character is excellent. I love it when he gets so frustrated with Danny and yells fuuuuuck! 




 Kobe couldve had more if he could play with a team. Lakers fans will talk about those championships forever. They will hold them up like a shield against any mention of the present (and future) reality: "Yea, 5 rings. Let's give Kobe $48 mil because that makes perfect sense!!!" 




 They sure did. While the Black Mamba was playing video games with his game face on.  




 There is a difference between being a cellar dweller for decades, owned by Donald Sterling, and having one if the best records in the league over four years. (We have the third best record since Chris Paul got there for years ago.) Magic is trying to create some stigma that just isnt there. They bombed game 6 and 7, but to say that means they are the team they've always been is a freaking lie.  




 Charity = tax deduction, fyi 




 Sure, but that amendment isn't constitutional.   




 Doc already said they're offering DJ the max contract.  Said DJ really likes it there. 




 Kellerman, you've only been paying attention to the Lakers woeful season all the goddamn year, playing to the Laker market.  We don't care what you think. 




 I said the *taxation* part, not the *double* part.  But anyway, if something happens all the time, that doesn't make it constitutional, fyi. 




 The *taxation* part. 




 I was a fan of Showtime in the 80's (up until the Kobe era), but not a fan of Magic anymore.  This comment was clearly directed at the Laker fans who can't handle the Clippers success.  What's he talking about?  *Everything* about the Clippers has changed in the last few years.  If they don't win a championship, they're "cursed"?  Trying to define these guys by their past is beyond disingenuous, and he knows it. 




 If Magic hadn't been hanging out with Sterling's girlfriend, Sterling wouldn't have said those things about "black people", and wouldn't have been forced to sell the team.  We're having success today thanks to you, Magic!   




 Yeah, I like Corey Brewer too.  Him and Ariza.  Wish the Clips had them. 




 One of the two LA teams is living in the past, and it's not the Clippers. 









 So you're an existentialist then?   




 A lot of people say they want higher taxes, but none of them want to lead an organized movement to do so. And no change in policy is even required.  




 Why doesnt he put his money where his mouth is and pay more in taxes instead of hiding it in his foundation? No one is stopping him. The same goes for his buddy, Warren Buffett.  




 If I were Doc Id make dJ undergo hypnotherapy.  




 They arent trying hard enough. Gotta want it!!! 




 The league has to step up their fining of floppers, or the NBA is going to look like World Cup soccer before too long. 




 Yeah, Blake could shoot a little more, at least as his first option.  Back em down, and at least draw a foul. 




 Without Harden and his flopping, they're a respectable team.  I can't take Curry and Green.  Go Rockets, though I won't be watching. 




 It is only the media echo chamber.  None of them could answer that question.  That said, I think he's a pretty good coach.  Though I couldn't say why.  He gets out of the way and lets the players play.  He's a "player's coach".  But these guys needed some serious coaching.  They rely on talent, and that goes a long way.  But when push comes to shove, and the pressure is on, when they are psyching out, or not doing what they can do, they need some serious coaching.  Because they just seize up.  For starters, he should tell Blake to just back it down to the hoop every time.  He only drew one foul in the second half, and shot 2 free throws.  It's great that he scores almost 30 every night, but he could have 50.  But there are so many other things....  Basically, what does Doc do when the heat is turned up and the pressure is on? 




 In 2012-13 we had:
Matt Barnes /
Chauncey Billups /
Eric Bledsoe /
Caron Butler /
Jamal Crawford /
Willie Green /
Blake Griffin /
Grant Hill /
Ryan Hollins /
DeAndre Jordan /
Lamar Odom /
Chris Paul /
Ronny Turiaf /

Neil Olshey was the GM (now with Portland), and a good one.
But we also had Donald Sterling, and there has been a recovery period since he and Olshey left.  How did we lose a team with a the best bench in the league to get a team with one of the worst benches in the league?  We didn't play our cards right.

Ballmer, if you're reading this, please get us a good GM.  ASAP. 




 Step #1: Get a GM.  Doc can't do it. 




 I like him, but yes, we have to let him go.  Can't jump, gets his shots blocked always, commits silly fouls.  As much a liability as anything. 




 And Ariza.  He's been a stud since his days at the Lakers, who never should have let him walk.  How did the Clippers pass over him?

We have to sign players that don't have liabilities.  Except for DJ's free-throw shooting - that is about all we might be able to live with, especially if the NBA fixes that ridiculous rule in the off-season.  

Our prime search should be for a GM.  We had Olshey - now he's with the Blazers. 




 Big time wake up call.  As if Game 6 wasn't enough.  Doc can't be GM anymore.  Need a bench and some guys that can step up other than CP3.  Blake needs to get some attitude.  He should be getting 50/20/10 every night.  Where were Barnes/Crawford/Redick? 




 Yep, exactly. I like Doc but he cant be GM next year. 




 Neither 




 Yep. They tend not to see that banks, etc., are just as potentially evil.  




 2-bit philosophy: should humans have animal rights? 




 Before she died, she told them, "Over my dead body!" 




 ....with US help.  




 When Blake arrived.  




 And if the interaction *is* recorded, the officer still *may* be subject to a discipline process.  




 This guy is talking about a lot of things in a very helpful way to me. Im trying to write a comparitive paper about the Tao of "x" and even though it is all crystal clear in my mind the words and text are extremely difficult to put together. he's touching on a lot of the reasons why, reasons I hadn't thought of before.  




 The future is just as real as the present or the past.  




 "Primary?" You're making my point. No one is talking about primary.  




 To be brutally honest, you're not getting his point in the least.  




 When people aren't optimistic, it bums me out.  




 We arent optimistic or pessimistic. and you cant be/have one without the other. these are artificial labels we apply to things and to ourselves that obscure reality and communication. we should seek reality.  




 Any kind of law is a joke. Coercion, even if supposedly well-intended, makes a mess of things. Harmony should be the goal.  




 yeah that is what libertarians and some anarchists call the NAP. non-agression principle. dont mess with me or take my stuff.  




 The fact that immunity is even a question is one of the many things wrong with the police system in this country. 

Get rid of the police officers bill of rights for starters.  




 The title of the post is not true.  Further, Bob Dylan will appear the day *after* Vedder.

http://www.bobdylan.com/us/news/bob-dylan-perform-late-show-david-letterman 




 Some might, but it's dumb to think that's the only reason. Especially when politics is involved.  




 yeah i heard that. i think it was mentioned in one of the games, but not sure. ive liked ariza since he was with the lakers.  




 Right, though getting Big Baby makes me wonder.  He is a player with a lot of limitations.  Then he passed over Ariza and got Hawes, though many thought Hawes would contribute much more.  Ariza is a stud, and good at defense.  Would have fit in well.
 




 Yes, but Doc the GM is responsible for not having a bench that can be relied on.  




 He didn't just give them $75K out of the kindness of his heart.  What did he get in return? 









 Exactly. We have to close out games! We cant seize up and hope to run the clock out. We play better when we push the ball and create opportunities. We have talent, but we need to use it at will, not just whenever it happens. CP3 gets it.  




 Whatever happens this season, however it ends, Doc can't be GM next year. We need a reliable bench like what we had in 2013. 

I fault Doc for not telling the team that when something is working, do more of it. Like get it to Blake inside. They cant guard him with one man. Seems like after a while Blake starts passing too much. 

We also stopped pushing the ball in the 4th quarter. Went to a hesitant half-court game. 

This team needs to be able to finish off games. Hopefully this was a wake-up call, and not the end of the season.  




 he kills their offense because hes such a one man show. and always at the foul line or trying to draw fouls. no one else can get in rhythm.  




 Usually they are a 'rescuer' type looking to be needed, and misreading everything.  




 Lead with competence and by example. Dont lead like a mindless choleric.  




 it is more about harmony, which is something that prevents problems and doesnt exacerbate the ones that exist. if problems are attacked with force or good intentions they get worse. force itself is a problem. harmony is key.  




 Tim Donaghey talked to him a lot by phone during the game-fixing scandal, according to records. But Foster was never charged with anything for some reason.  




 Who are the other two?  I'm guessing Joey Crawford is one of them. 




 Because I don't enjoy his prose enough to read that much of it.  So I'm not going to call him pretentious based on that, and certainly not in the same way as Cormac.  Yet, at least.  For whatever reason, I gave Cormac much more of a chance, or chances.

Cormac is all about himself, not his writings.  They're so bleak because that's the best he can do.  The bleakness doesn't have any merit on its own.  How many times is he going to use the same adjectives, like "thin"? 

Far back beyond the mountain a **thin** wire of lightning glowed briefly.
"The last **thin** paring of the old moon hung over the distant mountains to the west."
"He lay on his back in the gravel, the earth's core sucking his bones, a moment's giddy vertigo with this illusion of falling outward through blue and windy space, over the offside of the planet, hurtling through the high **thin** cirrus. 
"The man sat watching the road, the weed stem twirling in his mouth and the the reed **thin** shadow of it going long and short upon his face like a sundial's hand beneath a sun berserk."

....for starters.  Goddamn it's painful just to read that here.  Totally self-absorbed, and unnatural, and necessarily repetitive.

Just because *The Road* makes you long for the end of the world, doesn't mean Cormac is skilled at evoking an end-of-days kind of feeling.  His writing doesn't *evoke* bleakness, it is itself bleak.  There is a big difference, which most can't distinguish.

If Cormac wants to make a tour-de-force, he should focus on his writing and let it speak for itself, not use his writing as a vehicle to say "look at me!".  Great writers disappear.  Every time we see missing punctuation in Cormac's text, we're distracted and reminded that it's all supposed to point to him.  Many people so badly want to believe that they willingly fall for this trick. 




 "It is a great adventure to contemplate the universe beyond (hu)man(ity), to think of what it means without man  as it was for the great part of its long history, and as it is in the great majority of places. When this objective view is finally attained, and the mystery and majesty of matter are appreciated, to then turn the objective eye back on man viewed as matter, to see life as part of the universal mystery of greatest depth, is to sense an experience which is rarely described. It usually ends in laughter, delight in the futility of trying to understand. These scientific views end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty, but they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all arranged simply as a stage for God to watch mans struggle for good and evil seems to be inadequate."  ~Richard Feynman 




 Exactly.  Some places the pedestrian legally has the right of way when they are dressed in black jumping out in front of buses at night.  Why would the pedestrian *want* the right of way anywhere but at a controlled intersection? 




 No. 




 Spectacular at being pretentious.  




 ....and look both ways before crossing the street - whether you are at a crosswalk or not. Why just assume people in cars would stop, especially when not stopping could kill you? 




 Cormac tries to damn hard, and it's obvious. He writes much more for his own recognition than for the story. 




 Hamburglar 




 Because they arent good writers. Because they are discussing things that havent been discussed much, if at all. Because they are writing usually for fellow academics. 

But it is primarily that they arent good writers. Some philosophers are excellent writers, like Kierkegaard.  




 They aren't equivalent. Drawing Muhammad isnt wrong in any other context. Saying nigger is wrong in any context, unless you're a black rap artist.  




 Not really.  Police shouldn't be in the business of rehab either.  I know it's good that this isn't news of another police shooting or abuse, but let's not go overboard.  Let me know when their police union is no longer advocating long prison sentences for non-violent "crimes" like drug use. 




 Just YAC, baby! 









 If he were really a rationalist he wouldn't wear his short-sleeved shirt over his long-sleeved shirt.

 Seymour Hersh is an American.  NBC has backed his reporting.  NY Times has backed a lot of it and said the rest is likely true. 




 You have to pay about 40% of what you earn to the government every year.  




 Data such as???  Magical revelation in a dream.  

If God manifests himself to you, you'll believe in him, regardless of what you think of free will, etc.  You won't really have a choice. 




 Well, he calls us his children, and calls himself our father.  I wouldn't say children and treating people like children trivializes their existence.  God himself tells us to be like little children all through the Bible.  

We certainly aren't capable of understanding the why of things even as adults.  This is obvious.  We are adults, but we still are finite and mistake-prone, etc.  

Christians have a lot of knee-jerk responses to this kind of thing that don't pass the slightest scrutiny.  They make declarations like it is sacred to be treated like an adult.  Who cares if you're treated like an adult if you have no way of seeing how he's treating you, hearing his voice, etc.?  Is the fact that he is so mysterious and so silent due to his desire to not be easy on us, to treat us like adults?  Whether he trivializes our existence or not is a ridiculous point and a trivial point.  Who cares if your existence is trivialized or not?  And actually, it is trivialized if you suffer and die within a half hour of birth - or a gazillion other examples.  Christians hang their hats on empty pronouncements like this.  Basically, it comes down to God says so, so it must be.  But any interrogation of it fails.  And their arguments are buttressed by their sheer emptiness and lack of relevance to anyone who hasn't already subscribed to their baseless points. 




 Is that faith based on the presence of God or the absence of God?  Does he make himself so obvious that we can't help but put trust in him?  Or is faith required because of his lack of manifestation? 




 Yes, but God is a loving all-knowing father, who created us.  So he's not just letting us learn on our own like an addicts parents or whatever.  If anything, since he's God, not a human, he should be even more obviously in our favor than any human analogy would describe. 




 Do you *choose* to believe the sky is blue?

What is the object of a person's faith?  What/Who is their faith *in*?  How do they know that object?  Through revelation.  If they have revelation, it isn't faith.

Your post isn't that substantive. 




 Appeal it on what grounds?  The Patriots didn't even cooperate fully.  That it was too harsh of a punishment?  Terrelle Pryor got five NFL games for trading his signature for a tattoo - in college.  They have no standing, and that is why they might to outside the league.

Another thing:  These guys didn't just deflate balls, they went into the referee's room and took the balls out to do it.  Not a gray area.  Not something that all the teams do.  Not equivalent to sticking the balls in front of a heater. 




 We'll never know.  Why not give another interview, especially if you're telling the public that you're cooperating fully with the investigation? 




 Right, I should say "the God of the Bible".  

Many here are talking about  the *concept* of god, which is difficult to discuss because it can mean literally anything imaginable and more, not necessarily a God who declares himself a loving Father, the Good Shepherd, etc., even though that's what they might really mean. 




 We don't have free will, if our apparent choices are limited by God and if we have no control over the consequences of those choices, etc.  Any choice is an illusion.  Reality occurs outside the concepts and words that fill our heads and with which we communicate.

Put another way:  We need omnipotence/omniscience to have free will.  There is no reason to talk about free will in such a limited world.  

(Just chiming in, not arguing with you.) 




 A Taoist would reply that good and evil are necessarily unified.  You can't have one without the other, and they are one and the same (yin yang).  Yet he would also say that good-evil is only an artificial concept that is applied to nature, not intrinsic to nature itself.  As such, it is an illusion and a deception to the degree that we assume otherwise.   




 Yes, it is *very* analogous.  The parent-child analogy is perhaps the most relevant.  Parents simply don't let their kids have choices, because they know better than to let the kid jump in the pool, or take the car for a spin at age 8, or whatever.  They aren't given free will because their parents love them and want to protect them from themselves.  

On the other hand, Christians say, "How great it is that we have free will and God loves us enough to not make us robots or slaves.  But, darn it, too bad Adam and Eve ate the apple and ruined it for everyone.  But that's what happens when you have the ability to make your own choices."  A loving father would never treat his children the way God treats his children.  He wouldn't make himself mysterious, unheard, confusing, leaving them to fend for themselves so they can learn the hard way, suffer, etc.  

But further, *we don't have free will*.  You don't have free will without omnipotence.  It isn't free will if your choices are limited by someone else, and the results and consequences of those choices are determined by someone else.  It is not free will to be given the choice to eat the apple or not eat it, or else....  What if you don't want to be forced to make that choice and don't want those consequences?  

Heck, is faith even a choice?  Do you choose what you believe?  And if you choose what you believe, is it really a choice if the consequence of not believing is eternity in hell? 




 Me too.  I laughed hard after Danny spotted Kevin watching him from his truck across from the gas station.  When Danny walked away, Kevin hit the ceiling of his truck and yelled, "Fuck!....Fuuuuuck!!!"  Hilarious. 




 The few. The proud. The Marines.  




 No way is it too harsh. Brady lied to everyone and tried to charm us into thinking he would never do such a thing. He didn't cooperate with the investigation. Neither did the Patriots. But they said they did. They have a culture of cheating and lying. 

They deserve whatever punishment they get. Goodell happened to get this one right.  




 Watch it again. He touched both hands to the ball before it was fumbled. 
Edit: No one even heard of the Tuck Rule until the next day. 




 Tom Brady denied it, lied to everyone.  He didn't cooperate with the investigation.  Nor did the Patriots.  Then they said they did cooperate.  He's a liar to his core.  (I remember when he lied about throwing the "tuck rule" fumble - he said he was passing it for Christ's sake.)

They deserve whatever they get.  Glad Goodell *finally* showed some testicular fortitude.  I was starting to wonder if he wasn't in some secret discussions with Brady's lawyers.

EDIT:  Downvote and run without a rebuttal if you can't handle the truth. 




 This is the *one* he got right.   




 He's "good" at it and the refs go for it a lot.  I wouldn't say it should be taught as a fundamental like dribbling, passing, or shooting.  It is the fault of the refs as much as anyone. 




 Maybe you are thinking too much. Like we all do. Use your intuition to see things as they are without putting a pre-established conceptual framework over it. Everything can be reduced to generalities, but only through our minds and the language they use. Most other people get caught up in this too, rituals, expected behaviors, habits, which doesnt help. Just remember, actual reality is not that way.  




 I agree, the way Barnes and Redick are playing him is most of it, but the Joey Crawford crew was calling all of that and more in game 2. 




 Now he can call Goodell a liar without getting suspended for 3 weeks. 




 Playing like that appears to be catching up with Harden.  When the refs don't call those fouls, it has to be embarrassing for him.  Messes up his whole mentality as a player when Option #1 doesn't work at all. 




 Check out the story of Judyth Vary Baker. 




 They developed this vaccine in response to the CIA trying to kill Castro with lung cancer.  He smoked cigars and this would allow the CIA plausible deniability.

Check out the story of Judyth Vary Baker.  She was recruited by the CIA to work on this cancer - the cancer, not the vaccine - secretly at the Roswell Cancer Institute and in New Orleans for Dr. Alton Ochsner (who was one of the first to connect smoking with lung cancer).  Baker developed a fast-acting cancer, testing it on mice, for the purpose of assassinating Castro.

In a related story, Jack Ruby (yes, the guy who killed Lee Harvey Oswald) died of lung cancer while in jail.  Toward the end of his life he was injected with large bore needles, and suspected they were giving him this cancer.  He was aware of the work going on in New Orleans.  Very soon after being injected, sure enough, he contracted lung cancer and died.  The CIA, et al, didn't want him to talk. 




 Why do we care what Kobe thinks? 




 Who were the other two teams? 




 All the time. People even say it about the people I draw. I couldn't care less.
