I can put up a skin theme when I return from school

Basically I set up eight visualizers. Mapped the frequency ranges. And colored them. Also edited the smoothening variables.  




 Yeah figured that out , the high end frequency on each visualizer is in changeable though:( 




 Time=TWELVEFOURTY

 I know haha it was a joke LOL. 1998 here, poor af family, grew up using these things.

Woah there didn't notice the visualizer-bar thing...good eye.
