 Made a room and tried to wb with a friend. Both using android and its stuck on searching for ally. Is it still buggy from SB update? 




 I just bought the phone off someone and the software is still at 4.1.2. I tried to manually update it from the RUU provided by HTC website but my phone gets stuck at the 'loading bootloader' and causes the phone to disconnect from my laptop, ending the updating process. On top of that it gets stuck on a black screen that just says HTC and the only way to restart the phone is by pressing power and volume down button. Is there a way to fix it or something or am I doomed to forever use 4.1.2 (I had Verizon's HTC One M7 at 4.4.2 and I love the UI and the personalization feel of it)

Note: Phone is not rooted or anything 




 I use to do it every day whenever I have tickets, now I'm just whatever still in bronze... This update made me feel less incline to play. I don't mind the grind but I don't know I lost my drive :( please come back i love this game 




 MASS APPEAL, ORANGE RIND, SMOKE YOUR GREEN I'M SPENDING MINE  




 Why does the meat double? 




 I run Asus9 and with dionne spam I have only a brief window where I can dish out damage before the next Dionne. It takes so long that sometimes Alex dies before I can finish off the rest of the team x.x Dionne pls  




 I just got my D'Art after failing a bunch of times (I run 6* Alex 6* Himiko and 5* Naz, it works ok I just used bella because I forgot to switch to sera.) :) 




 I fell asleep when I did mine. Himiko could only do so much...... I got boss to half health then dozed off a little... I applaud your patience because I did it for like 20 minutes but gave up when I fell asleep again  




 The ai hates Asus9. :( I've been on a ridiculous losing streak against mages as well as those d'art+hikari combos... (Also because I didn't pay attention)
