 Sorry if you felt misled--the article is centered on NEWS SUPPRESSION IN THE UNITED STATES...(the term is in the first sentence)

PBS is definitely quite dependent on foundations which don't want ruffled feathers...the Ford Foundation also has CIA ties...

Here's a [**IMGUR**](http://imgur.com/gallery/5vxh8im) I made if anyone likes the Moyers quote...

EDIT: Happy 81st Bill... 




 AWESOME...I think people really give Roger Stone the shaft--he's a gifted writer with plenty of colorful stories which unmask the personalities of LBJ and Nixon. One of his books (in free pdf) is posted at r/TSBD 




 THINK about what you would say if a Chinese or Russian newspaper merely regurgitated allegations with no On the Record comments--and zero verifiable proof of the damage. Most likely, you wouldn't even read about it--because the US Corporate Media wouldn't even print the allegations.

FEAR is good for the US economy--last year the FBI-DHS both announced large increases in their budgets for fighting international hackers.  














 The Saudis have had a cozy relationship with the CIA since the 80's--they even helped fund the Contras...most likely the Saudis supplied the patsies and some funding...the head of Pakistan's ISI was in DC at a meeting with Bob Graham and Porter Goss on the morning of 9/11--one week later he was forced to step down after a newspaper from India published an article which claimed there was a $100,000 money transfer from the ISI chief to Mohammed Atta.

You can also find a fox news report on youtube which raises serious questions about Israeli Mossad agents being arrested on 9/11--if you look hard I think you can even find interviews with NJ cops who actually arrested the Israelis. 




 I think NIST said 2.5 seconds--hitting freefall for any amount of time should be a huge red flag which ought to be prominent in any investigation. 

I also think it defies logic to have nearly symmetrical downfall from asymmetrical damage. 




 I noticed that in the guardian's story--they quoted both AP and Reuters...but, as usual, not one On the Record comment. The timing is also key--with Sec. of Defense Carter making aggressive statements about China's building an island to use as a military base in the South China Sea. (at least China didn't invade/overthrow a country to acquire a military base which is what the US seems to do) 




 The larger subreddits are officially part of the Military-Media-Industrial-Intelligence-Corporate-Congressional Complex*...either jump on board with WAR, INC. or be shadow banned.

(MIC)^2 Complex 



















 I watched this the other day: 

[Taliban offers to hand UBL over if the U.S. can provide evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5401gaR7fIk) 




 WAR, INC. has taken over--the MIC has now officially grown into the Military-Media-Industrial-Intelligence-Corporate-Congressional Complex...

The Corporate Media sees bombings and articles teaching us how to hate are GOOD--while actual photos or articles exposing the destruction are BAD. 









 Agree--sad how many Americans today don't have any care that many now claim over 3 million deaths in the aftermath of the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan + Iraq after 9/11. 




 props to the history channel--thanks for sharing... 









 FUCK--awesome find OP...seems to be pure "raw" intelligence.

I wonder who's handwriting that is and who assembled this.

I also don't know why this would be removed from r/conspiracy. 




 After taking a plea deal, Drake has claimed the NSA should have prevented 9/11 and criticized the runaway, expensive programs.

 "OOPSIE!!!  Hey Dick--we overreacted by $4 TRILLION..."

--GW Bush 




 No Way did WTC 1 and 2 just fall down--they were BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS

Rockefeller built the WTC--Standard Oil has CIA connections going back to before the CIA even came into existence...I think Mossad did the dirty work--but it was CIA-approved. 




 the intell about Hitler's invasion wasn't crap--Stalin snookered himself because he was so duplicitous... 




 Nixon has been dead since 1994...Kissinger should be prosecuted. 




 funny how r/politics won't take any of washingtonsblog.com article--"rehosted" content. 




 never heard about that... 




 I checked...not sure why but I could only find short clips on youtube (except for 1 very bad version)...

I'm a truther , too...I think Bush/Cheney didn't want any suspects on U.S. soil because they knew they couldn't control the cover-up under normal U.S. court procedures. It's completely absurd that the 9/11 Commission was only initially given $3 million--yet the SSCI initially funded the Torture Report Re-write (in Dec. 2008) with $40 million off the bat. This was so CIA-approved attorneys could shred the Torture Report from 6,300 pages down to 400 pages.

And, Yes--it's definitely infuriating. 














 Israel apoligized by agreeing to take BILLIONS upon BILLIONS of U.S. Military Aid...

BTW: did you know that Allen Dulles was called "Allie" by his family? read it in Stephen Kinzer's *THE BROTHERS* (pdf at r/TSBD) 




 Chris Hedges touches on this quite a bit--he says the U.S. has experienced a "slow motion corporate coup d'etat" where economics trumps politics...he also goes into Inverted Totalitarianism. 




 I think Mitchell's company billed the CIA (and us taxpayers) for $80 Million

Another author to check out would be Antony Sutton--there are a few of his pdf's at r/TSBD along with a video or two in the comments. 




 Coeur d'Alene is beautiful...I've driven thru there a few times.

r/TSBD has a pdf of [FINAL JUDGMENT](http://www.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/2cepmg/final_judgement_by_michael_collins_piper/) if anyone's interested... 




 We have spent $4 TRILLION in Iraq and Afghanistan--for nothing.

UBL was in Pakistan...remember??? 




 $40 BILLION to kill 1 terrorist...so???

the FBI never even charged UBL with 9/11 either...

Even more atrocious is the 3 million people who have died in Iraq + Afghanistan since 9/11. 




 The U.S. is just an exposed bully fighting to keep its over-extended Empire at this point. Obama has committed War Crimes as well--over 1,000 drone strikes. I'd assume Obama also gave the wink to NATO before Libya was thrown into chaos. 

The U.S. has spent $[**4 Trillion in Afghanistan and Iraq to catch UBL**](http://jfkfacts.org/assassination/uncategorized/the-exorbinant-cost-of-the-war-on-terror/#more-12113) and his partners who planned and carried out the attacks of 9/11...if there were 100 terrorists who planned and facilitated 9/11--that means the U.S. has spent $40 Billion to capture or kill EACH of the 100 terrorists.

 I definitely agree that Americans have undersold the contributions (and massive suffering) which the Soviet Union contributed to defeating the Nazis in WWII. The first book I read from the Russian side was Antony Beevor's collection of Vasily Grossman's writing titled [**A WRITER AT WAR**](http://www.antonybeevor.com/index.php/previous-books/a-writer-at-war-vasily-grossman-with-the-red-army-1941-1945/).

I've also been looking into the root causes of the Cold War--which was much more a manufactured product than many Americans can wrap their heads around. Antony Sutton dug a bit too deep into Stanford's research collection and revealed that 90% of Soviet technology was derived from the West--certainly made the Establishment (aka the profiteers) uncomfortable. [**HERE'S**](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2fnykt/q_its_1961_the_height_of_the_cold_war_the_us_has/) a post I threw up about how the Cold War was largely manufactured by the CIA-Pentagon. Last Veteran's Day, I dared to ask [**DO AMERICAN'S UNDERVALUE RUSSIA'S HELP IN WINNING WWII**](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/35et05/do_americans_undervalue_russias_help_in_winning/) 




 The series is very well done--wish they had made this episode on Intelligence longer, though. 




 The whole intention is to INSULT Shrimp Dick Cheney...he just stated (again) that he enjoys the Darth Vader reference...

what about a DC Madam reference?

 I was once stupid enough to believe the Fucking Fairytales that cbs, nbc, abc, cnn, fox, NYT, WaPo, and the rest of the BOOTLICKING SYCOPHANTS pump out everyday... 














 Harry Truman dropped 2 nukes on Japan--supposedly there would not be deaths due to radiation after the initial blast...More importantly, Truman signed the [National Security Act of 1947](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Act_of_1947) which renamed the WAR DEPARTMENT into a much more appealing Department of Defense. The National Security Act also created the CIA--which was supposed to be "an intelligence gathering arm of the President," but which turned into an out of control agency which some have pegged responsible (directly or indirectly) for up to 30 million deaths. The failure of Truman to control the drawdown of WWII eventually blew up to become what Eisenhower would call the Military Industrial Complex.

Harry Truman also created the [Truman Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doctrine)--which threw the Cold War into high gear. The CIA brainiacs decided to give former nazi SS Eastern Front Intelligence Chief Reinhard Gehlen $5 million to start an intelligence agency in West Germany--this lead to many deaths in Eastern Europe as Gehlen's men were often double agents and even sold the CIA completely bunk information...Pay people millions of dollars--and they will tell you what you want to hear! The CIA has also infiltrated U.S. colleges/universities, but, most importantly, the MEDIA. Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Guatemala, Iran...etc...We are now sold wars on the basis of "spreading democracy"--and most Americans have no idea (or care) that there have been 3 million killed in the Middle East since 9/11. 

Even Truman's Marshall Plan (which was intended to help fund the rebuilding of 16 cities in Europe and Asia after WWII) indirectly was responsible for many deaths: The CIA pilfered at least 5% (about $600 million) of the $15+ Billion Marshall Plan to fund their dirty operations around the globe. The funds were diverted to buy mansions for station chiefs--but mostly to buy weapons and to act as political slush funds iaround the globe:  Greece, Italy, France--even Japan. NATO was formed in 1949--the CIA and the intelligence agencies of western Europe created Operation Gladio (insert many more deaths).

Astoundingly, Harry Truman was also indirectly responsible for the death of JFK--he even wrote an [editorial in the *Washington Post*](http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman%27s%20CIA%20article.html) which ran on 12-22-63. The editorial stated that the CIA was supposed to be an intelligence gathering arm of the President--not a runaway operations and dirty tricks squad.  Truman wrote: "For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas." cough cough.

Anyone who has read *Legacy of Ashes: A History of the CIA* knows that often it is not only the president who doesn't know what the CIA is doing--sometimes the director of the CIA doesn't even know all the different operations going on inside his own agency. The "War on Drugs" should also be thrown in--the CIA and the military have been connected to drug running and laundering of drug money from Vietnam to South America and, yes, even the Middle East...(Afghanistan's poppy yield in 2001 was virtually eliminated--today under U.S.-Taliban control it is the world's largest supply) 




 Israel said "SORRY" by accepting BILLIONS upon BILLIONS of U.S. Military Aid. 




 FUNNY How last week everyone wanted to watch that BULLSHIT frontline documentary (which revealed nothing new of significance)--but give them an actual award-winning documentary...downvoted!!!

 imgur doesn't give many options in terms of fonts and outlines... 




 true--I think there are plenty of psychos at the Pentagon and CIA...but one shocker as to how embedded the military has become in American society was while watching a documentary [**WHY WE FIGHT**](https://vimeo.com/5718564)...in the doc a woman, who came to the U.S. as a child from Vietnam, is shown working at a bomb factory pushing around bombs like they are just sacks of potatoes...she has no care that the bombs she is working on will KILL PEOPLE. 




 awwww...I guess you missed the recent John Kiriakou interview with John Jay of The Real News...

 Hint: Can you name the U.S. President who pulled down his zipper at a press conference, showed his sexual organ to the reporters and told them "This is what it's (Vietnam) all about."

btw: 70% of BPD don't even LIVE in Baltimore 




 A former CIA Director, Richard Helms, testified to the House Sub-Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) that Clay Shaw was connected to the CIA--which means that Jim Garrison was RIGHT...the case against Clay Shaw should have resulted in a conviction--if it hadn't been for all the CIA-FBI FUCKERY. 




 If you pay "consultants" billions upon billions, year after year--they will eventually tell you what you want to hear. At first it was the CIA paying former nazi SS Reinhard Gehlen to drum up communist gossip...Flash forward 50+ years, now that the CIA and the Pentagon have privatized many of their functions exponentially--the warmongers will continue feeding the Military-Media-Industrial-Intelligence-Corporate-Congressional Complex. It started with Think Tanks, like the Rand Corporation, but has now spread to thousands of office complexes across the USA. 




 Yeah, sorry...my french is bad so I figured anyone would just slam my translation:

approximately: "In your opinion, which nation contributed the most to the defeat of Germany in 1945" 




 Besides the obvious rampant militarism--Hollywood and the Pentagon have literally turned [**WWII**](http://www.les-crises.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sondage-nation-contribue-defaite-nazis.jpg) upside-down. 









 WRONG--the current system of allowing rampant secrecy makes it impossible for WE THE PEOPLE (and our elected representatives) to hold the agencies ACCOUNTABLE for their actions...we now have a broken, corrupt system of oversight of the CIA-NSA-DIA-DoD (etc.)--these agencies (and their contractors) can torture, kill, bomb, drone with impunity--because they know the POTUS will never be held accountable either...

POTUS and the Three fucking Letter Agencies KNOW they can endlessly stall investigations...there is ZERO oversight at this point--where does this ugly road end? 




 I included the bit about the bombing of Wall Street because I have: 1) read the book...and 2) it is one of the oldest series of files which remain kept from the public that I know of...I have heard there are even files from WWI which remain unreleased to the public--but I have never studied WWI 




 [Defense Intelligence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency) 




 There is no valid reason for not releasing documents which are 95 years old. Some of the docs may be from private investigators--but all the docs produced by U.S./State/local agencies should be released to the public in full and without redactions.

I would even make the argument that ALL documents which government agencies produce should be released IN FULL and without redactions no later than 4 years after their creation date.  




 Neither...it's the DIA which, to quote John Judge, has "10 times the budget and 100 times the manpower of the CIA." 














 **Q**: How can we *know our own history* when so much of it is kept secret from us for decades? 

Some examples: 

+ Even much of the early funding for the CIA was kept secret from the public for about 50 years. The CIA pilfered at least 5% of the Marshall Plan funds--at least $680 million out of the $15 Billion+ which was supposed to go to rebuild 16 cities in Europe and Asia after WWII--instead went to fund CIA operations.

+ There are still plenty of WWII records NOT RELEASED--check Operation Paperclip...

+ Yale history professor Beverly Gage wrote a book in 2008 about the 1920 bombing of Wall Street--yet she couldn't get any files released about the event almost 90 years later...Gage wrote about this in the appendix to her book *The Day Wall Street Exploded*.

+ John Stockwell noted in the mid-80's that the Church investigations of the 70's had taken the time to count the number of CIA Operations--they found that in the first 25 years the CIA had run about 9,000 small-scale operations and 3,000 large-scale operations...


 




 As if the DoD needed even more ways to cause Death and Destruction.

We all know who the Biggest Bully on the Block is.

How is the U.S. considered "peaceful" when it is the only country to ever use nuclear weapons in war, openly admits to torture after 9/11 of hundreds (if not thousands), have committed thousands of drone strikes, and spy on almost every person, business, agency and government in the world--including their own citizens and politicians.  




 [**WAR PROPAGANDA: U.S. CIA-DoD PLANTING STORIES IN THE NEWS CHAIN**](http://www.globalresearch.ca/war-propaganda-planting-stories-in-the-news-chain/5451318)... 









 Last week Frontline proved what a waste of your time they are with a vacuous "investigation" of the Decade Old CIA-Pentagon Torture--there was absolutely nothing new in the Frontline report (except for a couple of scraps about the CIA feeding info to Hollywood...which we already knew). 

PBS/Frontline is following the TRAITORS of the entire corporate news cabal--the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX--they have all FAILED to investigate and print the TRUTH.  They have all sold their corporate souls and allowed the POTUS and the Pentagon to give them permission to print. Rather than defend the freedom of the press, these corporate prostitutes have settled for PROFITS over TRUTH. 

As we saw with James Risen's investigation of the Patriot Act--the NYT was all too willing to hold back the story for 18 months. It was only after Risen went out and got a book deal that the NYT finally printed his report (which won a Pulitzer). Even when these TRAITORS report on a story--you should know it is filled with Pentagon Propaganda and Half-Truths.

It is Useless to watch Frontline anymore--unless you want to expose yourself to the CIA-Pentagon Propaganda Wurlizter.

"It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question the government."

--Benjamin Franklin, Conspiracist

 




 I've been wondering since Belzer said that...it would be very interesting to take a peek at released/unclassified British intelligence files on what Allen Dulles was doing during WWII (and beyond)...we do know quite a bit of background on the Dulles family and their involvement with Sullivan   Cromwell...they were even involved in the post-WWI settlements...In Stephen Kinzer's book **Brothers**, he points out that one of Allen Dulles' ancestors actually helped arrange the overthrow of the Queen of Hawaii in 1893...(it was a bloodless coup...Hawaii wasn't a U.S. state until 1898) 




 **Richard Belzer**: "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles." (last 3 minutes of 15 minute May, 2013 interview: http://www.politico.com/multimedia/video/2013/05/richard-belzer-book-tackles-jfk-conspiracies.html)
 




 certainly would have been a much different discussion if they were going over the Zapruder frame-by-frame and Brugioni could comment as the film rolled...i still think Brugioni coming out is a very large step which points even further towards a cover-up. One of the best insider accounts we could ask for in terms of an actual upper-level CIA-approved insider speaking out. 




 sorry--couldn't decipher that...lots of people seem to be leaving reddit--but that's what the corporate heads want...a safe zone where uncomfortable facts don't get in the way. 




 Don't bother with the FACTS...just degrade the film and keep on believing that Warren Report BS.

You put forth no logical argument--just negative attitude. 




 Understood--didn't want to violate any rules...but thought this was a strong report that deserves to be seen!

Hopefully a few people will check it out--it really shows how these GA politicians prostitute themselves. (other states are alluded to as well) 









 why are you attacking the films I post with just CHEAP PUT DOWNS instead of attacking the CONTENT???

Obviously, it's much easier for you to resort to cheap shots than actually put forth a logical argument. 




 the "shitty doc" you refer to used primarily Corporate news reports which have never been followed up on--what is wrong with continuing to ask questions when the USG and the intelligence agencies have so obviously stalled and obstructed the 9/11 investigations? Even the [**9/11 Commission Co-Chairs wrote a letter**](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) to the *NYT* stating their investigation was obstructed by the White House and the CIA. One former 9/11 Commission member was asked if we need another 9/11 Commission--he stated that "We need at least Fifteen 9/11 Commissions."

In *The Zapruder Film Mystery* Doug Horne, former chief analyst of military records at the Assassination Records Review Board--from the NATIONAL ARCHIVES actually has found several of the men who worked on the Zapruder film for the CIA over the weekend of 11-22-63. 

If all of you quit with your knee-jerk reactions you might actually learn something someday. I have a feeling you are too fucking brainwashed and think the USG is a benevolent association which bombs the world for democracy. Good Luck with that--someday our children will be paying for all these bullshit fucking wars (maybe us, too)...all of that may happen sooner than you think as the world switches off the PetroDollar--it may turn out our only friends only liked the U.S. because we had money and a gun pointed at them.

 John Stockwell referred to the Church Committee investigation which counted CIA Operations between 1947-1972: 9,000 small-scale operations and 3,000 large-scale operations--every one of them secret, every one of them, by definition, a conspiracy. As the fucking CIA has now been around for almost 70 years--you can Triple these numbers: 27,000 small-scale operations and 9,000 large-scale operations which the public has virtually no information about. The files we are given access to are also heavily fucking redacted.

We know the CIA and the DoD are extremely secretive and extremely compartmentalized. During the Vietnam War, Daniel Ellsberg finally read the Pentagon Papers which clearly showed that the U.S. would have to commit 500K to 1 million soldiers to control South Vietnam--yet, this remained SECRET (even from the President) with only a few traitorous fucking generals knowing this info.

[Daniel Ellsberg](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/05/daniel-ellsberg-secrets-can-be-kept-reliably-for-decades--even-though-they-are-known-to-thousands-of-insiders.html): "The reality unknown to the public and to most members of Congress and the press is that secrets that would be of the greatest import to many of them can be kept from them reliably for decades by the executive branch, even though they are known to thousands of insiders."

 the NSA was once actually investigated (mid-1970's)--as James Bamford wrote about in this article: 

["Never before or since has an entire agency been the subject of a criminal investigation. Senior officials at the NSA were even read their Miranda rights."](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/02/the-nsa-and-me/) 









 First of all: According to John Judge--the DIA is supposed to have 10X the budget of the CIA with 100X the manpower. The DARPA program is the fucking Boot Stomping on your Face that Orwell warned us about. 

There was a program in the 90's which was updated around 2000 and became DARPA. (I can't find the links--but cryptome has both of the reports on their site).

Before 9/11, the DoD (under which the DIA operates) ran an OPERATION DARKHEART which ID'd at least 4 of the 9/11 hijackers 16 months before 9/11 via "open source intelligence". I think DARKHEART was a TRIAL which was meant to be further refined and put in place once more funds became available after 9/11. 

The DoD cannot account for $8.5 TRILLION since 1996...It's also fucking scary that the DoD has no restraints when it comes to running OPS on Americans who are in the U.S.

I didn't watch the whole video--but knowing that the DoD and CIA regularly work in lockstep with Hollywood and the corporate news sycophants...this is just another step towards 100% Totalitarianism: a corporate-fascist state.

America has sold itself to corporate overlords...you own tax dollars have paid for this runaway train. All that's left to do now is to sit back and watch WWIII as the U.S. takes over using the 650 military bases on foreign soil to attempt to: 1) save the U.S. economy and; 2) control energy and other vital resources by plundering the countries under U.S. control...enjoy the show!!!

 Below are two excerpts from [*INSIDE THE COMPANY: A CIA DIARY*](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/30oi1g/inside_the_company_cia_diary_by_philip_agee/) by Philip Agee (1975)...just THINK about how much the CIA and all the other agencies have grown since then--in 1990 there were 11 intelligence agencies, today there are (at least) 17. after 9/11 the intell agencies and their contractors grew exponentially beyond anything Agee could have imagined in 1975... 

---------

When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book. Excerpts:

--------------

Even after recent revelations about the CIA it is still difficult for people to understand what a huge and sinister organization the CIA is. It is the biggest and most powerful secret service that has ever existed. I don't know how big the KGB is inside the Soviet Union, but its international operation is small compared with the CIA's. The CIA has 16,500 employees and an annual budget of $750,000,000. That does not include its mercenary armies or its commercial subsidiaries. Add them all together, the agency employs or subsidizes hundreds of thousands of people and spends billions every year. Its official budget is secret; it's concealed in those of other Federal agencies. Nobody tells the Congress what the CIA spends. By Law, the CIA is not accountable to Congress.

------------- 




 I'm sure you can go to archive.org and look up the Church Committee and find the actual figures they released in the report...or you can listen to [**John Stockwell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ioJGMCr-Y) (a former CIA Operations Director)...

it's not worth my time to do the research for you because I don't think you've even bothered to watch the Tom Daschle video link above--where he clearly states that Dick Cheney asked him on "several occasions" NOT to investigate 9/11...

 




 Body Language 101... 




 FBI director Louis Freeh wasn't with the program--so he resigned and was AWOL for about 6 months leading up to 9/11...ABLE DANGER was a TRIAL to be put in place after 9/11--not an attempt to actually catch anyone...

The anthrax scare was used to bully politicians and the press/population into obedience...leaks about this could be dragged out at anytime--to distract if there was a HOT story...likewise the constant threat level (orange, red, etc)...

The press began reporting possible Torture by the US in early 2002 (Feb. or March)--this could be leaked to STOP a hot story as well...

wikileaks, CIA torture, Snowden--they are all battles worth losing to cover up the Largest Crime ever on American soil...there have been NO budget cuts--and if there were the DoD can switch funds
easily (there are no audits)...no one was ever Fired from their jobs, either...

the DoD-CIA know that the farther away in time we get--the less the public cares (and the less they will remember)...

 




 At the time, Cheney-Bush claimed it was "because we were at war and couldn't afford to distract resources". But, I think it was far more devious than that: 

1. [**Cheney-Bush asked Senator Tom Daschle NOT**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pTt2cQvUww) to have the Senate-House of Representatives Intelligence Committees Investigate (this was known as the "Joint Commission")

2. Cheney-Bush Stalled the formation of the 9/11 Commission and underfunded the Commission once it was finally formed--the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with only $3 million. For reference, the investigation of Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinski cost over $40 million...in 2008 the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence funded the Torture Report with $40 million--this was to EDIT a 6,300 page report using only CIA-approved attorneys (not to write the report!). The 9/11 Commission would eventually receive about $14 million in total--about one-third of the cost of the Torture Report (Re-Write).

3. Cheney-Bush attempted to place Henry Kissinger (CIA-insider) as Commissioner of the 9/11 Commission. [**HK met with some of the victims' families**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmHPfXemf10) in his office--they asked him if his law firm would disclose a list of clients (to make sure there were no potential conflicts of interest). HK wouldn't disclose and turned the position down. 

4. The eventual Commissioner would be Lee Hamilton (and Thomas Kean)--who had served on the Iran-Contra hearings with (guess who?)...Dick Cheney...In 1989, after they successfully shut down the open Iran-Contra Hearings from revealing too much--Dick Cheney was awarded by the new president, GHW Bush (former CIA Director), with a nice step up: Secretary of Defense (even tho Cheney had taken 5 deferments during Vietnam)

5. The 9/11 Commission was given a tight timeframe: 16 months (compare that to the 4 years which the Torture Report rewrite was allowed). In addition, the 9/11 Commission office in DC was in a CIA managed building...(remember the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence scandal last year in which the CIA was SPYING on the SSCI)

5. The first thing Cheney did in office was to hold his secret Energy Task Force meetings--the ACLU and the press demanded to know info about the meetings but was denied. [**Eventually--2 years later**](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/07/18/cheney-energy-task-force-documents-detail-iraqi-oil-industry.html) the ACLU was able to get a few pages of their meeting released (one of the pages was a map of Iraqi oilfields along with what companies were under contract). Cheney and the CIA also planned for [**Regime Change in Iraq**](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003) since the 90's...

6. During the 90's--after the fall of the USSR, the US defense and intelligence agencies were hurting from budget cuts and scandals--and, even  worse, could no longer yell "COMMIE!!!" and receive Billions. After GHW Bush left office, Cheney went to Halliburton--but one of Cheney's last acts as Sec. of Defense was to fund a study examining the potential for privatizing some functions of the DoD.

7. Ultimately, YES, 9/11 was a long-planned, super-compartmentalized DoD-CIA operation with a goal to give the US a new Super Villain and thereby revive the defense and intelligence sectors. For those who think hundreds or thousands had to know--that's BS--the CIA-DIA operates in extreme secrecy. In the mid-70's the Church Committee took a look at CIA operations: [**the CIA had run 9,000 small operations and 3,000 large operations**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ioJGMCr-Y) between 1947-1972...every one of the operations was the definition of a conspiracy.

8. In addition, Cheney-Bush shut down the SEC investigation of the stock market profiteers who placed PUT options on United on 9/11. The Patriot Act was forced down the throats of Congress, [**the intelligence agencies**](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/) and the defense contractors expanded exponentially. Booz Allen (which the Carlyle Group would buy) even began getting millions of dollars in  September, 2001.

9. After the victims' families and the press finally pressured President Bush to testify before the 9/11 Commission, the President of the United States finally agreed...but only if it was NOT under oath, NOT in public and NO notes were taken...The President also demanded he be allowed to have Dick Cheney hold his hand, too. Bush-Cheney had screamed "9-11" from the rooftops on a daily basis--but couldn't even officially testify in public and on the record to the 9/11 Commission. As a bonus insult, Bush held a [**5-minute "press conference"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) afterwards in which only 6 questions were asked. Odd that C-Span has deleted the press conference--9/11 researcher Jon Gold posted it for us on youtube (otherwise we might not be able to see it). Please watch the "press conference" for yourself and note the words and body language--is this man telling us the full truth? Notice he can't even say he "testified" and has to say "I had a conversation" with...

--------------

EDIT:  what many of you are Failing to comprehend is that America is a CORPORATOCRACY--it is no longer a free republic and there is NO "democracy"...if you fill large office buildings with people and pay them six-figure salaries they will tell you what you want to hear...One example is the [**Cold War LIES**](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2fnykt/q_its_1961_the_height_of_the_cold_war_the_us_has/) that the USSR was ahead in nuclear capability--the Pentagon and CIA and the RAND corporation advised the President the Soviets had more missiles--when, in fact, the US was well ahead of the USSR. The [**DoD can't account for $8.5 TRILLION**](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget)--yet every business, every citizen and every government agency is by law required to submit to an audit every year (except for the DoD and the Three Letter Agencies)...the Military-Media-Industrial-Intelligence-Congressional Corporate Complex will sure as hell do what it has to do in order to ensure the Billions upon Billions of dollars keep flowing.

 Contains very little info that we didn't already know and acts to Obscure a very important fact: The CIA destroyed about [**90**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_CIA_interrogation_tapes_destruction) videotapes--not just 2 tapes as the doc states. For a Deeper Look into the CIA-Dick Cheney driven Torture see [**TORTURING DEMOCRACY**](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/torturingdemocracy/program/index1.html)

Philip Zelikow's appearance is a punch to the bloody face of Lady Liberty as well. Zelikow had helped to WHITEWASH the 9/11 Commission as its executive director under the Co-Chairs Kean and Hamilton. For those that haven't read it--here's Glenn Greenwald's column after the 9/11 Commission Co-Chairs had written a *NYT* editorial stating the commission was [**OBSTRUCTED**](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) by President Bush, Dick Cheney and the CIA. The "evidence" obtained via Torture must be considered invalid and inadmissible--the "evidence" must therefore be taken out of the 9/11 Commission Report. 

It is beyond comprehension that some CIA-contracted Lowlife made $80 Million by Torturing--your tax dollars.

In an unprecedented move, the parent companies or main banking units of JPMorgan Chase   Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L), Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and UBS Group AG (UBSG.VX) are likely to plead guilty to rigging foreign exchange rates to benefit their transactions.

The banks are also scrambling to line up exemptions or waivers from the Securities and Exchanges Commission and other federal regulators because criminal pleas trigger consequences such as removing the ability to manage retirement plans or raise capital easily.

In the past, waivers have generally been granted without a hitch. However, the practice has become controversial in the past year, particularly at the SEC, where Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein has criticized the agency for rubber stamping requests and being too soft on repeat offenders.

**Negotiating some of the waivers among the SEC's five commissioners could prove challenging because many of these banks have broken criminal or civil laws in the past that triggered the need for waivers**.

Many of the banks want an SEC waiver to continue operating as "well-known seasoned issuers" so they can sell stocks and debt efficiently, people familiar with the matter said. Such a designation allows public companies to bypass SEC approval and raise capital "off the shelf" - a process that is speedier and more convenient.

Several of the people said another waiver being sought by some banks is the ability to retain a safe harbor that shields them from class action lawsuits when they make forward-looking statements.

The banks involved are also seeking waivers that will allow them to continue operating in the mutual fund business, sources said.

At least some of the waivers at issue in the forex probe will need to be put to a vote by the SEC's five commissioners. No date has been set yet, a few of the people familiar with the matter said.

The plea deals could be announced as soon as next week, two of the people said, adding that not all the penalties had been finalized yet.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department, declined comment on the timing or reason for a possible delay of any agreements. Citi, JPMorgan, RBS and UBS did not respond to requests for comment. A Barclays spokesman declined to comment.

The Justice Department has been negotiating with the banks for months over how to resolve allegations that **traders colluded to rig rates in the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market**.

If the parent companies of U.S.-based JPMorgan and Citigroup plead guilty as planned, it would be the first time in decades that a major American financial institution has done so.

Last year, when Swiss bank Credit Suisse AG (CSGN.VX) pleaded guilty in the United States to helping wealthy Americans evade taxes, it became the largest institution in over 20 years to admit criminal wrongdoing. It was soon followed by French banking group BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA).

Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday night that the U.S. Justice Department voided a 2012 settlement with UBS related to interest-rate rigging.

**Citing current and former government officials, it said the negotiations were expected to result in deals next week in which UBS would pay a fine of about $200 million and plead guilty to allegations that its traders manipulated the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, before 2012**.

 Imagine that: **delays and obstructions of congressional investigations**

--------------

(from article) In 1991, Congress began an investigation into the 1980 issue, suspecting that it may have been a prequel to the Iran-Contra scandal which had involved Reagans secret arms-for-hostage deals with Iran in 1985-86 (also with Israeli help). The George H.W. Bush administration collected documents possibly related to the 1980 events and shared some with the congressional investigation, including the Haig talking points.

But Bushs operatives  trying to protect his reelection chances in 1991-92  engaged in **delays and obstructions of the congressional inquiry**, which finally agreed after Bushs defeat by Bill Clinton in November 1992 to say that it could find no credible evidence that Reagan and Bush had orchestrated a delay in Irans release of the hostages. The hostages were finally freed on Jan. 20, 1981, immediately after Reagan was sworn in as president.
