 This is relativism, and is the laziest, most unhelpful form of reasoning. Basically what you are saying is 'it could be worse, therefore fuck it.' Yes countries exist where quality of life is much worse than in America, but that isn't the issue at all. If a situation is so poor you have to resort to this logic, it must be pretty fucking awful.  




 A friend of mine who I knew from Kindergarten age enlisted after leaving high school and was shot in the neck on Christmas Eve a few years back. He died after several hours. Remember, men do not give their lives for their country, their country takes their lives without thanks. Joining the armed forces may seem glamourous, thrilling or patriotic, but remember you are volunteering to allow men you have never met to risk your life for reason's that don't concern you.

Most importantly, please consider the effect your joining the armed forces have on your family. I daresay most in this thread will have know of someone or will themselves have lost beloved family member to the forces. Remember it is not only your own happiness you sacrifice by joining.

Please consider your decision very carefully, and don't buy into patriotism. Your country does **not** need you, and by volunteering you will not be safeguarding your country from darkness. I of course have only the absolute greatest respect for any serving men or women and veterans, but I cannot help remember my friend, the loss his family and friends suffered, and the terrible feeling of waste I felt upon hearing the news.

Thanks for reading. 




 Michael Jackson was a black man. His children all had blonde hair and pale skin. You do the math. 




 Back, and to the left.

Incidentally, I have looked into this as I found it a genuinely interesting subject. There are holes in the story, and big ones, but the points that generally are raised by conspiracy theorists are mostly entirely falsifiable. It does seem, based on all the evidence, that JFK was shot from the 6th floor of the Book Depository. The kill shot, as seen on that Zapruder film, is consistent with an exit wound from the back right, Kennedy's head moves the way it does because of the exit wound which blasts out the front of his skull causing his head to move back, towards the shot. James Tague (possibly spelt wrong), sometimes referred to as the third wounded man, was nipped by a fragment that could only have come from the direction of the Book Depository. 'The Magic Bullet' is also easily explained. Whether the shooter in the Book Depository was Oswald is unclear, but very likely. If it were just for these facts, there would be no conspiracy theory, it is clear that Kennedy was shot, using Oswald's rifle, from the Depository. Where it gets interesting is Jack Ruby, Clay Bertrand, the reaction of the police when arresting and interrogating Oswald, dramatic change of Kennedy's policy under LBJ, and the fact that many of the secret documents and evidence, including Kennedy's brain, has disappeared. Literally: it is unaccounted for.

 Thus spake the newlywed 




 Tonight I had the Burg-As Bro  Little Beer Quarter

*Beef and lamb patty with pork belly, fried quail egg, aged cheddar, chilli-onion jam, pickled beetroot, Tuatara APAioli and lettuce in Pandoro bun, with chips and dip*

Easily the best burger I've had so far, the patty was beef and lamb, which I thought sounded like a weird combo before I tried it but tasted awesome, the pork belly was perfect, and the aioli set the whole thing off nicely. I thought a few crisps with a sour cream/mayonnaise dip instead of chips was a nice touch, and the bun wasn't too heavy so it didn't fill me up to fast. Honestly couldn't find a single thing to fault it, even the beer was nice!!

10/10 - would definitely eat again! 




 If anyone was interesting, the music is ['Sail - Awolnation'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaAWdljhD5o)

 Things are better in America than in China and North Korea. Things are a shit load worse in America than in Europe or Australasia.

 '*Emigrate*' means to move from a country, '*Immigrate*' means to move into another country. Both are applicable in this sentence.

 Great photo! What kind of lens did you use? 




 An entire story in a single word. This is brilliance.  




 You're more than welcome, I'll be rooting for you! 




 Don't go *anywhere* without travel insurance. Seriously. Also, spend more than $10 on it. 




 I empathise with your plight friend. I of course won't say 'I know what you're going through', because I don't and that is a cliche. I know how it feels though to be silently in pain, and to feel like a burden. Small things make huge differences, allow someone, be it a friend, parent, sibling, anyone, to understand what is causing your behaviour, or why you are unhappy. It seems daunting I know, but this is the first step to getting better, and it's important.

Most important of all though, is you need to show people how strong you are. Endurance is the greatest trait a person can have, because without endurance and your ability to endure pain, strength is meaningless. Remember that you *will* break through this, no matter how hard it is now, not for anyone else, but for yourself. Because you are strong enough to endure it, and once you have proven that to yourself nothing can hurt you, and one day you will be so proud of yourself that you came through a very dark time with your head held high. 




 No, no I'm not. 




 It is morally certain that everyone of european decent reading this thread is descended from Charlemagne. It is equally certain that everyone of central or east asian decent reading this will be descended from Genghis Khan. There is also a fairly solid chance that European redditors will be related to at least one of the Caesars.  




 To all those arguing that the practice is in some way medically beneficial and not linked to religion or sexual repression, consider first that circumcision is not only forced upon men, but upon women also who suffer an even more ghastly and humiliating procedure. There is no justification for female circumcision, at all, other than cruel sexual repression of an infant by an adult, and should not be considered as anything but repugnant. 

Consider this before you defend such a barbaric tradition as this, please. 




 Yes. The practice is a religiously inspired one, and the central tenant in all major religions is sexual repression, which of course is no coincidence. The purpose of circumcision is to weaken an desensitise the organ in question, thus discouraging its use, especially in girls. These are the facts. 




 Maybe he should have stopped getting his dick out and rubbing it in the sand? 




 Overweight women in corsets with far, far too much cleavage. 




 Have you ever read 'The Communist Manifesto' by Karl Marx? You might find it interesting. Throw the phrase 'Means of Production' in that comment and you pretty much have the blurb 




 Sectarianism. I see plenty of people saying 'religious differences' in this thread, and that is a fair point, religion does tend to be a divider. However, it is not the only one. Sectarianism takes many forms, be it religious, race related or nationality, to name a few. Anything that allows people to use the label "Us" and "Them", rather than "we". This is a primitive and primal instinct, but it is the last obstacle to be toppled before mankind may know peace. 




 Every single post in this thread is sexual in nature. How very Freudian.  




 Entropy. For the first time in history the rate of human population has started to increase at exponential speed. Before this present period in history the general population remained steady as life expectancy was far shorter and infant mortality was far more common. The world population only topped 1 billion in approximately 1810. Now there are 7 billion, a 2 billion increase in the last 20 years. This planet is an isolated system, we only have so much energy and as the population increases the energy becomes spread out far too wide and is rendered ultimately useless and finite. No new energy can be created capable of sustaining an exponentially growing population: the human race is, quite simply, unsustainable. The only hope is the discovery of a new boundless energy source (which on principal contradicts the first and second laws of thermodynamics), or extraterrestrial colonisation. It's going to be a scary century.

**EDIT:** Energy in this sense does not only pertain to electricity. Fuel in general is what is meant, be it mechanical, biological or simply food. Solar Power alone will not be enough to sustain humanity. 




 Not strictly true, I think what you mean is we know more about the surface of the moon or mars than we do about the bottom of the ocean. We clearly don't know more about the endless(?) space of the entire universe more than anything, mainly because a lot of it is unknowable. 




 The universe is either finite or infinite. Either way the mind boggles 




 Dude, too soon! 




 Not the point. These people need unconditional aid. Although American flags on bags of rice or grain do not demand anything from those they help, missionaries do.

 Actually, that's a common misconception! Yes Christians where horribly persecuted, particularly by some Roman Emperors, but no Christian was ever fed to the lions in the Colosseum! I did have the source for this but can't find it, I'll look it up later 




 You haven't been watching closely enough. The reason the violence is continuing is because a large islamic group who supported the now ousted president Morsi because of his radical Islamic beliefs have been violently continuing to protest, which has caused the military in turn to violently suppress them. There is politics and revolutionary sentiments obviously, but the reason for the continued violence is Islam, or rather An Islamic group protesting in favour of stricter Sharia Law and Islamification of Egypt.

This is a statement of the facts, with no opinion. 




 See my edit. Also, you are not of a different species to Hungarian people. A better analogy would be trying to learn to speak dolphin. 




 Add the juice! Otherwise it will be too dry, it should be a reasonably liquid final product! Experiment though, make it your own thing! 




 See my edit. Koko could sign enough to get what she wanted or identify her needs, but she couldnt use it to speak normally, as a person would. She had a cat by the way, not a dog :) 




 In all fairness, this is obviously new (no link older than 14 days) and is relevant to whats going on in the world, and none of the previous submissions gained momentum so most won't have seen this. Also, OP didn't give it a terrible and predictable title. The picture is clever, reasonably provocative and relevant. The repost is acceptable, in this case. 




 This actually only really helped the medical profession, which is obviously a huge help! Just for day to day use however using loads of anti-bacterial products will actually weaken the immune system. 'Boy in the bubble' principal. 




 Hugely under appreciated. Mankind has been searching for an effective birth control for thousands of years and it was only definitively discovered, made safe and universally available within the past  two generations 




 I assume you are american living in the UK? People are all different obviously, I think a general norm is a healthy person would only go to the doctors as and when they need it (maybe once every 6 months average, assuming they are mostly healthy). Dentist's are more of a routine, I would imagine its the same most places. once every 4-6 months, maybe. 




 It's not such a stupid question, don't worry. No that theory wouldn't work as human communication (in this instance sign language) just isn't natural to chimps or gorillas, their minds just don't work like that. If they want to communicate with one another or with their young, which they do, they do so through other means (i.e body language, eye contact etc). Though they are intelligent enough animals to be taught basic sign language, they can't actually ever use it to communicate efficiently, as a human would, because it simply doesn't make sense to them. It's like a human learning to climb a tree to get fruit from the top branches. Though a child might be able to notice the adult climbing the tree and understand why they are doing it, it won't actually improve the child's climbing ability.

**EDIT**: Okay, I'm getting lots of comments from fairly silly people who apparently don't understand analogies. Chimps cannot use sign language, no none-human animal has ever learned or used sign language in a remotely human function. Some very intelligent animals have been taught how to communicate very basic messages, such as "Look over there," "Give me food," "I want...," etc, but it is not in the nature of an animal to understand human communication, grammar, sentence structure and so on. Surely that is obvious. Monkeys communicate with each other through very different medium. A mother monkey may teach a young monkey how to sign something in order to get food, but this is no different from a human mother showing a child how to open a coconut or cook meat in order to get edible food. It is not language as we use the word, because monkeys do not use language, they simply do not have the necessary brain function to understand or use human-style language.

My climbing trees metaphor may be a poor example, but surely you can get the metaphor? The point I am making is a child cannot learn how to do something unatural to them, like talking to dolphins or building a honeycomb, simply by observing, it is something that has to be taught, because by it's nature it is not normal human behaviour. If you took issue with the statement because children can climb trees, you're an idiot. 




 Doesn't really matter. Chopped tomatoes are preferable, but if its whole tomatoes you can just mince them up a bit in the pan with a knife or wooden spoon 




 My Spanish Tomatoes recipe takes 5 minutes and is honestly one of the nicest meals I have ever had. Here goes:

1. Heat up a handsome dollop of Olive Oil in a frying pan, add a few herbs to taste.

2. Add chopped onion, thin sliced garlic, olives, a jalapeno or two, maybe some meat to the hot oil.

3. Allow the onions etc. to fry for a little while, then add most of a tin of tomatoes to the pan, making sure to stir thoroughly

4. add more seasoning, especially a good pinch of salt (sea salt is best), oregano or basil is good, maybe some more garlic or dried garlic flakes. If you have it add a good splash of balsamic vinegar and a cheeky few drops of red wine, stirring thoroughly.

5. Keep stirring and leave on a high heat for a few minutes, until the tomato juice boils off somewhat.

6. Serve! I like to do myself some fried bread with this, which is easy enough, just add a little more oil to the pan after you have plated the tomatoes and put a few slices of bread in the hot oil for a few minutes.

Enjoy! Extra bonus points can be achieved by adding some chorizo sausage and red wine with the onions, and adding feta or parmesan cheese with the balsamic vinegar. Once served sprinkle a little feta cheese and salt over it and you're ready to boogie! 

**EDIT**: For those who are going to have a go, comment back with how it goes, especially if you try something original! Lots of people are asking for pictures, unfortunately I don't Instagram my food because I don't have the mind of an 6 year old girl, but if someone who cooks it could upload a picture it would help everyone out! Glad you guys like my recipe! Now go cook it for your friends and make out you've been cooking it for years and you just made it up one night! 




 Sounds good to me, let us know what you thought of it! 




 Who's checking out Burger Wellington this year? Thought it would be good to get a thread going so we could share if anyone enjoyed/didn't enjoy a burger, or wants to recommend one! Bon Appetite fellow Wellingtonites! 




 This is pedantic, but it clearly isn't leading the formation, assuming this photo wasn't taken by a passing swimmer. 




 Yet he will apparently worship a genocidal xenophobe. hmm. People need to stop assigning their own beliefs onto their own version of God. Tutu will no doubt be praised for this, but it is just another example of a religious figure giving their own value to 'God' to either make a point of for political gain. Not cool. 




 It is conceivable that OP's girlfriend knows this person, it seems like a bit of a strenuous lie otherwise. 




 Ever so slightly off topic, but I'm English and I remember exactly where I was on 7/7 (The London bombings). I was on a school bus on a school trip to London Central Mosque. We turned the bus around, we thought going to the mosque might not have been sensible on that day. 




 Did...did you just call Vince a c#*t? 




 The Nepalese ran an expedition to clean the mountain in, I think, 2010. They filled up several skips and removed many of the bodies. The documentary you watched is probably out of date. 




 They are prayer flags. The mountain is sacred in Nepalese and Tibetan tradition, they are at the summit to honour the mountain, not someones junk.

This comment thread kind of makes me sick, all I see is a bunch of kids saying how easy this is because many people do it. You guys have the wrong idea, this is a hugely significant achievement, the reason you see pictures of lots of people summiting at once is because there are only a few days in the entire year with good enough conditions to summit. 

Climbing Everest is still an immense physical achievement. Yes a few people have done it by now, but the huge majority fail every year. One in eight people die climbing Everest. It is a very big deal to stand at the top of the world, and one of the most physically gruelling things a human can do. It's isn't as though there is a stair lift the whole way, it takes several days and real strength to climb. Yes there are more challenging mountains in terms of mountaineering ability, but that isn't the point.

OP, your girlfriend is epic and deserves the highest of fives, bravo! I trekked to Base Camp a few years back, I felt privileged just to be there, let alone attempt a climb. Make sure you hang on to this one, she's a keeper!

 Change but the name and this story is about you.  




 An elderly woman sits down to her supper alone, for the first time. 




 Chiang Mai, Thailand right? 




 As it happens I have been round the world 3 times so far, the first time when I was 18 when I travelled alone, self-financed and unaided for 9 months. I was attacked by a cobra in Laos, had a close call with a tiger in Burma, and was nearly mugged in Kathmandu, although was able to defend myself. I have seen more death than many my age and have plenty of experience of the darker side of humanity. And I have never felt the need to carry a gun. Please don't lecture me on how the world works, I don't come to your place of work and knock the sailors cocks out of your mouth do I? Grow up a bit, and realise the world isn't out to get you. If you are not a complete idiot, you will never be in enough trouble to need a gun. If you are that much of a moron, carrying a gun will only put you in more danger than it will prevent. Grow up. 




 To defend yourself from what exactly? Just admit you carry a gun to feel more in control, or more masculine. Comments like the above just make you look like a paranoid dumbass, so the choice you have is to represent that facade to the world, or admit you are an insecure yet decent person with penis issues. If you are in law enforcement, or are being hunted by cannibals, you would have a point. But this is the real world, you are not the star of a movie, so please do yourself a favour and cut the action-hero bullshit, and maybe just stuff a few socks down there. 









 I would have a great deal more respect for pro-gun individuals, such as yourself, if you could simply stand up and say 'I carry a gun because it makes me feel safer and more in control/confident', rather than spew these ridiculous, hole-ridden arguments. A first aid kit is in now way the logical or moral equal of a gun. It is a moral certainty that no situation will occur in your day to day life that will require you to be carrying a gun, or that you will be somehow be able to 'save the day' or be in a better position than anyone else because you are armed, you will almost certainly only put yourself at greater risk. This isn't the movies. 

The only exception to this rule is if you work or live somewhere where there are dangerous animals (e.g bears) or for self defence if someone breaks into your home, in which case it is permissible to own a small gun which can be stored in a safe place in the house. There is no reason to carry a gun in your day to day life, assuming you aren't a member of law enforcement, and it would be nice if you would be honest enough with yourself(ves) to admit that. 




 Why carry at all? 




 More paranoid than thinking it is in any way necessary for an ordinary citizen to carry a gun?

 Fuck the plot, Salma Hayek!!! 




 If you read the original script by Alex Garland the ending is actually pretty awesome. I love the film personally, but I do think Danny Boyle made a few errors in judgement in how he shot the end sequence, but that is just my taste. In Garland's script each characters storyline comes full circle in the end, theres no silly punch-up between Pinbacker and Capa, and Pinbacker has a much more awesome (dare I say, fitting?) death. 




 I often think the older I get the more the world looks like a creme brulee 




 Fantastically written dissection of the film! I thoroughly enjoyed reading your critique, I would be interested to hear what scenes were deleted from the film which might have fleshed-out the character a little more or covered some of the plot-holes, any examples spring to mind? 




 Sometime, in moments of extreme stress, a persons mind will simply disconnect from its surroundings in a primal psychological attempt to escape. If, for example, a person were being tortured over a long period of time, their mind would invariably enter a make-believe state. These hallucinations can be extremely vivid, as though the person is living an ordinary life, or can be more like a fantasy, like driving a fast car. Time and reality can be constant or inconstant in these dream states, for example you may at one moment believe you are in one fantasy when your brain will suddenly jump to another, fabricating memories or circumstances to fit the hallucination. But the real world always eventually will force itself back in on the hallucination in order to bring the victim back to reality, be it noises, physical pain or, more commonly, the face or faces of whomever is present in the real world with the person suffering the hallucination. Other times, when these stimuli don't work, the mind of the sufferer will continue to point out the flaws in the fantasy, like waking up from a dream, to force the victim out of the dream-state and to wake up, as prolonging the hallucination may result in insanity, the sufferer must be brought back to the real world, you must WAKE UP 




 Our Solar System will have been destroyed long before then, by several billion years. Not to worry! 




 A day will come when the sun will rise on the world and everyone and everything alive now will be dead and gone. It will be a normal day, the sun will rise, and no one will care. 




 I sometimes wonder when I am walking down a crowded street how many of the normal, every-day looking people around me have committed murder or rape, or any other terrible crime. So many crimes are unsolved, so many killers or even serial killers walk free. They could walk past me on the street at any moment, dressed in normal clothes, looking like normal people. And I would have no idea.

 The Universe is either finite or infinite. Either way the mind boggles. 




 [Here is a link to an AMA I did about travelling a while ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14dbv0/i_travelled_around_the_entire_world_solo_when_i/), hopefully you can find a few tips in there, any more specific question then feel free to message me, I'm happy to advise as I only got as far as I did thanks to the advice of others! I self-funded myself by working a few jobs for quite a while before I left, rather than work on the way round, which you can do!

Don't be worried by your nerves, anyone would be nervous about taking such a big step. There will be times when it seems utterly overwhelming, but you have to keep reminding yourself what you are doing, be proud of yourself and enjoy the ride! Keep reminding yourself that what you are doing is remarkable and something you will look back on with pride, and will make you a much stronger person in the end. Most of all you need to learn endurance and self-reliance, they are the two most essential things a traveller can possess, after a valid passport! 

Good luck with your travels, do you know where you are going yet? If you have any more questions feel free to message, hope it goes well for you! 




 i earned my own money by working several jobs and payed for things using that money 




 Already started it 




 Come on, Boromir was being played by Sean Bean! He obviously wouldn't be around long enough to enjoy a gift even if he got one, waste of good stocking-fillers! 




 I'm not sure if this counts, but I have been present, as a civilian, at a number of mass-demonstrations and social uprisings, in Thailand and Nepal, probably being the most dangerous. The Bangkok riots (pretty sure they were on the news a few years back) were intense and turned violent quickly, no one could leave or enter Bangkok for several days as the airport was closed and the roads were jammed, and an unofficial curfew was in place. There was a huge military presence, lots and lots of guns and I even saw a line of tanks on Ratchadamnoen Klang, one of Bangkok's main streets. It was an interesting experience and the first time I heard gunshots fired in anger, but I kept my head down and after a few days was able to leave. An interesting few days they were though. 




 I travelled around the entire world alone when I was 18. I was completely self-funded and I managed to make my way across Asia to the Indian sub-continent and got AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness or Altitude Sickness) while climbing to Mount Everest Base Camp, among many, many other bizarre and awesome experiences. I am fucking proud of it as I see it as a major achievement, but it's impossible to talk about it without sounding pretentious or arrogant, so it never really gets mentioned. It already feels like it has become a private story or memory, which it shouldn't be, because it doesn't get talked about. 









 I really enjoy the poetic, lyrical posts, especially some of the work posted by everyones favourite /u/ipostatmidnight , I would love to see more people have a crack at this sort of writing! Remember, poems don't have to rhyme or even be coordinated, it can be a fun way to challenge yourself, especially if you already enjoy writing!

 Does anyone else think this looks like a terrible, white-trash proposal? Disneyland? Seriously? 




 Don't panic too much, the reason we are having so many close together is there are literally tens of fault lines around wellington and through the cook straight. The quake on friday morning will have relieved pressure in one place but put more strain on a separate fault, like a domino effect. It is possibly a good sign that right after the 6.5 there was another 5.5, so maybe the pressure has been relieved. There is no way of knowing though, but don't panic!! 




 [heres the latest news on the quake](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8945358/Big-quake-shakes-central-New-Zealand), is there anyone in here who is in CBD? Is everything okay? What's going on? 




 Things were falling off the walls here in Pukerua Bay, is the centre of Wellington okay? Any damage? Geonet now says it was a 6.5 followed immediately by a 5.5 




 Very hard to say, there are literally tens of them all in the cook straight, and the top of South Island. What has likely happened is one quaked caused another fault line to go in roughly the same area.

Where did you feel it? Any damage where you are? 




 The problem is there are so many fault-lines around Wellington and the Cook Straight, when one goes it relieves pressure on one fault but puts loads of extra pressure on a separate fault, like a domino effect. That's why we have so many close together.  














 Is everyone alright? It hasn't caused any damage in town has it? It felt quite substantial up in Pukerua Bay!
