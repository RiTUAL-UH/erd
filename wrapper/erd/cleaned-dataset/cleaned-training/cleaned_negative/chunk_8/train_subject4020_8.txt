 You have to die in or immediately after the act of murder. 




 I think so too, or at least, kids have very vivid memories. So even when they don't understand something, it will eventually click with some new thing they learn and they have that aha moment 




 Yea in my opinion, (granted I'm 22 no kids so I have no real experience) I would think treating them like an intelligent person and telling the truth is better in the long run even though it probably won't achieve the desired effect immediately.
