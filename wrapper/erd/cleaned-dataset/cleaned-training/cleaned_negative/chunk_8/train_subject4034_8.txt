 Copyrighting so hard right now 














 Actual chills 














 The fella with the beard is at work and asked me to respond. As a bit of back story, we all initially began our training with beards- it was kind of a gimmick for charity. He was admirably the only one who kept his throughout, and we actually shaved it off together about an hour after this picture was taken. But here's his response:  

"it definitely kept me warm on a relatively cold day. Disclaimer- Not advisable for use with summer training regimen in NYC and is generally incompatible with most models of girlfriend."

Anyway, thanks for the kudos!

 




 Ha! Who is this? 




 Thanks. I think I'm still smiling now.  




 The entire thing was memorable. Even the people who were miserable were smiling because of the crowds. The three of us ran the entire race together so we had a lot of support throughout, and we did about as well as we thought we would. If I had to pick one moment, it was coming off the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan. The crowds, which were already massive in Brooklyn and Queens, were ENORMOUS in Manhattan. It was such a cool experience. Thanks for asking!  














 TL;DR, My twin brother added "I want to come on your hard tits" to my final paper in an AP history class. Teacher was a feminist.

 Two time reader here. The first reading wasn't so much difficult as it was disgusting. I've read some dark stuff, but this one got to me. It wasn't until the second read that I realized how amazingly intricate and beautiful the prose was. I actually sympathized with HH and thought of the book as some great story of love and loss. Every time I mention this I get weird looks, but it has become a favorite of mine. Keep at it.
