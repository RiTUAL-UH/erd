 Spore. best one they've done 




 I get ads every single video and I watch it on my TV. Other channels aren't like this, but the Grumps are for some reason (probably because I watch a succession of videos on their channel) 




 The only time I think he's acknowledged the issues is when they weren't his fault (like when people gave him shit because of the six minute episode, when Arin/Dan didn't record enough footage)

Other than that, he isn't even able to fix those things except for the thumbnails 




 He misses an assload of cues and there were blank frames in a few episodes, the audio levels were fucked up for a while, he put up the wrong thumbnail once or twice, I'm sure there's more, these are just the ones I remember off the top of my head 




 (*looks closely*)  Insert Coin Here? 




 So a Rabbi, myself, and a minister walked into a bar and the bartender said "what is this, a joke?" 




  If the entertainer listening to the criticisms is ultimately their own personal choice, then what's the point of your comment here even existing?


There are a lot of stupid people that don't understand the concept of criticism. This is where people labeled ventgrumps as whiners, nitpickers, etc. 

There's already several posts complaining that they don't want to be downvoted if they criticize the show. Why can't they stand that other people have a different opinion? "Oh no I got downvoted! I guess everyone else is an idiot!" is the general consensus amongst people like this.

 The criticizers know that the Grumps have a choice. 

The criticizers don't seem to know much of anything. There was a guy on Ventgrumps shortly before it closed complaining that Game Grumps is "now a comedy show and no longer talk about game design" **that** is exactly the problem with illegitimate criticism. If you don't understand what the show is and always has been to begin with, why should you post your opinion at all? And why is it such a sin for someone to downvote your completely useless opinion?

 Thus, your comment is completely useless.

I can see that it went right over *your* head, but it's not useless if it helps ONE person understand my point 




 It's one of the best sketch comedy shows out there.

Check out their movie "Run Ronnie Run" 




 VentGrumps did the exact same thing if you tried to differ with someone's "Criticism" so don't act like this sub is so much worse when people downvote something they disagree with. 

If they change the show to fit someone else's tastes, then there is a huge chance that it'll no longer appeal to the people who currently enjoy it (the same goes for all forms of entertainment)

The biggest problem I saw with VentGrumps was that people started their ~~whining~~ "criticisms" with the basic assumption that every person agreed that the show has decreased in quality at some point. (and the only ones who didn't were little children/fanboys that had shrines dedicated to the Glorious Grump Gods, or something) This is simply not true and the show always has its ups and downs, people just tend to remember the best parts and think it was more entertaining in the past.

Whenever there was a **legitimate** criticism *(like pointing out that I don't want to listen to 10 minutes of Arin trash-talking a game or watch 5 episodes of Arin dying in the same spot over and over again [both of which were only annoying because the conversations became stale])* I never got downvoted on the main sub and plenty of other people discussed this criticism openly on the main sub without downvoting.

If your post receives a large number of downvotes, that just means more people disagreed with your criticism than those who agree with you, regardless if it's "constructive" or not. Why diminish other peoples' enjoyment to please this **one** random person? If a musician I don't enjoy asked my opinion on how to make their music "better" and I offered some ideas that completely conflict with what their music is all about, do you think they should listen? More importantly, do you think they should listen to a large group of people all saying something different?

The only times I've seen Game Grumps pay attention to constructive criticism is when the majority of the fanbase agreed on something (my examples a few paragraphs above pertained to Super Mario 64 and their final few sessions of that playthrough showed that Dan was definitely listening to the people at that time and they got through with the game without any more problems)
If that's the case, then you won't be downvoted. If it isn't the case and your criticism is downvoted, then you need to accept the different opinion and move on

In the end, an entertainer can only create something that **they** want to, because it is impossible to please everyone. 




 you're not alone. Looks like I won't be checking out ConspiracyGrumps for a while if this is all ppl are gonna be talking about

 This just in: The Prince was unable to find someone to fit in his glass slipper and as such remains unmarried. Who knew the guy had a weird feet fetish, but I guess this explains a lot about the "unmarried" part.

 Mr. Williams, I'm sorry, but I have to deny your bank loan, because you have bad credit.

*Bad Credit will do fine*
 




 No, he is referring to the western fantasy genre, like LOTR. His reasoning for not watching LOTR is because that genre doesn't interest him 




 lol, i was just joking. I was expecting a "They're not REAL women response" 




  Ah, now we see that someone who does not have female genitalia and cannot produce offspring cannot be a woman.

What about sterile women? 









 Dude, security was all like "Whoa, don't go near that guy... he lives life on the edge!" 




 Got any good improv drinking games, specifically for playing at a small party/get together with a couple of friends?

Let's hear em! 




 Promote it more as a comedy show if you don't think they know what improv is. Then, at the beginning of the show, explain that you'll be making it up off the top of your heads 




 Why dontcha start by explaining that big ol' belly!? I thought you've been working out!

 This comment 




 It's called the "G-Spot" and it makes women cum.

You shouldn't push it because then they'll expect it every time. 




 He disappointed me by being a complete idiot 




 My mind tends to rearrange letters on signs or large text into something humorous. Probably a defense mechanism against boredom.  




 The Sun 




 Smoke, not have a sense of humor, and what diftuv said 




 Why not both? 




 join the police force then 




 So, Scully is automatically at the top, by default, right? All others are irrelevant 




 How do you know you wouldn't like chugging a gallon of AIDs-infested cum?

It's just something instinctual, I guess 




 You have four seconds to comment or it's absolutely meaningless!

Shit, I'm past my time!

 One time I entered Wal-Mart through the "Exit Only" door.


Edit: Someone downvoted because they couldn't handle how badass I am 




 what if #HuffNation turned out to be a vulgar sex act? It was all just a ploy to get her to search it 




 She's also on the cover of their album "Strawberries and Cream"

And yes, she's been in a lot of NSP videos and suggested to Dan that they start holding auditions for other models/actresses like her to play Danny's love interests as opposed to just using their friends 




 She's been in several of his videos. BTW, You're friends with Lauren Francesca!? That's already an amazing thing to begin with! 




 It would be the greatest thing that could ever possibly happen on the channel, but sadly might not because Arin is "not interested" in that genre (whatever the fuck that means)

 As many have said, this would be great for Wayne's World 3 




 more importantly, "WHAT'S Google Hangouts?" 




 You guys... that's so deep I'm worried we may never make it back to the surface!

 The only difference I've noticed is Ross seems a bit more talkative/energetic in the Sonic series. But it could just be how he felt at the time of the playthrough, these *are* recorded in short sessions 




 I guess neither of them are very good at improv 




 I'm more upset that Bloodborne is back

 Hey, Margie! Get the camera! I wanna make one-a-dem "Youtoo" videos! 




 Hey, sis, you bored? .... 




 What do you mean "Somehow" created his voice? His voice is pretty damn easy to create! 




 If you'd never play them for your family and friends then that doesn't mean comedy has less value, it just means you don't think your family/friends would enjoy this particular band. 




 Nah. As awesome as Skyhill is, there's more value in comedy, which he is really talented at 




 thank you :) 




 It's a subject that interests me (I've never done any kind of drug though and probably never will)

I think what interests me the most is how many people have shared experiences. I've been meaning to look it up myself, but I think others might be able to explain it better than a long complicated article 

Edit: I'm looking for a **scientific** explanation, not the typical spiritual drivel most people use when explaining it (hence why it's hard to research) 




 So did I!

By coincidence these are both my comedy idols.

What is the discussion you're referring to? 




 turns out God created the Earth on accident by spilling his soda 




 He **did** grow up as kind of a spoiled rich kid, so when the time came that he actually had to commit to/work hard on something, he probably couldn't handle it. It makes sense, and he did voice his disdain for the fact that it was a JOB (which is actually a very positive thing, despite his attitude toward it) several times on the show and in the Ode to Jon video 




  If you're JonTron 24/7, it's hard to stay funny and relevant, and that's probably part of why he left

True, but they only recorded on weekends in just a matter of hours. Hard to refer to that as 24/7 




 they're not owned by anyone (MCNs don't own anything, they just partner with people) but yeah, when it comes down to it, it's a **company** with **employees** that needs to keep the revenue flowing, at the very least in a just in case scenario where they end up losing money for some reason. 




 It's a compliment, but at the same time, people should've been educated long ago to understand that improvised scenes can be just as good as, if not better, than written scenes.

I mean, a written sketch/song is just a piece that's been improvised on paper 




 Nostalgia Critic 




 Didn't say there was anything wrong with it. But it's pretty gross to think of a 13-14 year old girl masturbating.

 




 well he had ugly in quotes, so I figured he meant more of the unexpected/dirty-minded stuff

 This looks like a job for Damsel In Distress! 




 turns out he's called that because his only weakness is Crowbars. (not sure why he'd broadcast that information that way, lol) 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pgv4t/iama_egoraptor_that_sounds_weird_i_am_egoraptor/c3p9u6e

That's just one. He's said it multiple times in interviews, this is the only one I know of for certain 




 that's what they're building right now, using money from Game Grumps and Starbomb.

Even if he did go to another studio, that wouldn't require him leaving the channel since his involvement in it is minimal already.

Danny had a day job up until the release of the first Starbomb album (because he only needs to be there for the recording sessions) 




 Wolfjob.  




 It'll be the whole channel once the company finally reaches the stage where they can create content for other platforms that provide more financial stability.

Arin and Ross are each working on an animated series, Starbomb is already a highly profited music project, Danny is always working on NSP and Starbomb, and there will be plenty of ideas that they'll have/pursue in the future.  

I foresee a Ninja Sex Party movie at some point that will bomb at the box office despite being totally rad and hilarious (like Tenacious D's movie) 




 So for what purpose would he leave a job that gives him an area to animate in an office that only asks him to work for an hour or two a week, leaving the rest of the time to animate?
