 No. Lost actually wrapped up all of its characters' stories...apart from Walt's. 




 Eight years, actually :( 




 It's been going without any problems like this for its entire run. Not counting any quality issues, you can't argue that the show hasn't continued to *exist*. The voice cast is the heart of the show. 




 If either Dan Castellaneta or Hank Azaria follow on, I think we have a dying show on our hands. 




 Wise in certain terms, notably quality-wise (in the opinion of some). 




 Creep is a bad song. 




 Nick Fury got a new eye patch? I liked the sunglasses from Winter Soldier + the S1 finale of AoS. Thought he'd go with them for longer. 




 [Sorry to break it to you, but...](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/35hdpx/deactivating_marvelawards_the_friendly/) 




 Ohhh... 




 They're *clearly* referring to **Orange is the New Black**. 




 Yeah with all of that human trafficking and sexual abuse. That's cross-marketing for you. 




 The exact comment they linked to says to post it here specifically to "rake in the karma". Therefore, star for honesty. 




 People only thought he might be in Black Panther because they thought he might be Everett Ross. 




 Captain Lorde? 




 He confirmed that he knew when it was filming and in between CW and IW he'll be doing side projects - he didn't *specifically* say he'd be in it, just implied. He's possibly misleading us. 




 To be fair, her face looks pretty elongated too...not even that much like her. 




 I heard Ultron would kill Pepper, causing Iron Man to fly off into space and arrive during Guardians 2. 




 !star for honesty. 




 *I broke my boy.*    
So glad to see Jonathan Banks getting some love. 




 Where the hell has Josh Peck been? 




 Cheers, I'll know better next time. 




 *"and you know it"*? I think they might, considering it's literally their entire comment. 




 EVRYBODY BETRAY ME I FED UP WITH THIS WORLL' 




 He literally shrunk himself down using real technology borrowed from Edgar Wright's Ant-Man development and fit inside the clay IRL. Such a talented actor. 




 Random fact: Jonny Greenwood wrote the film scores for both There Will Be Blood and Inherent Vice. He's also a kickass fucking guitarist. 




 Wow. The voters today are pretty naive. I got the reference. 




 *Underrated* means it isn't thought of highly enough by those who've seen it - that it's under-appreciated. Exposure doesn't factor into whether something's under or overrated. 




 Hey, woah, since when was Almost Famous bland?  




 Hey, Almost Famous!    
In other news, The Artist?! 




 /r/kyle  




 It's different, sure, but I really liked it when I watched it. This Bond was a straight-up cold blooded motherf---er who could feed a dude to sharks, burn a man to death and doom Benicio del Toro to being *literally ground to a pulp*, then go for a romantic dip with his lady. Bond to both extremes. Maybe not what most would want, but it's enjoyable to watch. 




 The *X-Men United* subtitle was definitely only used in North America. Everywhere else, it's only referred to as X2 or X-Men 2. I have no doubt the word *Men* was everywhere, as my original comment was a joke. 




 True :)     
Although I'm 90% sure that title only exists in North America. 




 [Forgetting something?](http://www.impawards.com/2003/posters/x_men_two_ver1.jpg) 




 I wrote a high school essay about this review! It's hilarious.    
Edit: the review is hilarious, not the essay 




 Both are awesome. I personally think 2 is way overrated. Too many characters, overstuffed plot, most of it doesn't matter by the end because we came to watch the epic fight scenes. It's still great, but way too long. 




 The film's been test-screening for *over a year* and I've heard absolutely nothing but praise. Can't wait! 




 Benedoctor Cumberstrange, then Fassassin's Creed a month later! Don't forget about X-Men Origins: Magic Mike! 




 [spoilers](#s "Not to mention Ward in an instant became a faaaaarrr more interesting character almost immediately when he turned out to be Hydra.") 




 [Spoilers](#s "Clarifying what others are saying: Technically, the gem/stone is IN the scepter. The scepter harnesses the gem's power.") 




 It's kind of a thing where the first ten of so episodes of Season 1 are pretty weak, but the characters begin to really grow on you; and by the end of the Winter Soldier episode (which has its own twist that makes the series itself much better) the implications for the entire team make you really want to keep watching. 




 Definitely, because during Toretto's fake death that was clearly Paul. 




 "Marvel" referring to Shazam, right? 




 Nope, he's definitely playing electric in the music video. 




 Watch [*American Beauty*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/)! 




 Tyler Durden was the antagonist though. Norton and Durden were two characters in one, and Durden was a manipulative psychopathic hypocrite.  




 Worked for me in Alien Blue. Just took 15 seconds to load up. 




 Damn it, why didn't I think of that? 




 *George Miller's "Sad Hands", coming to a theatre near you* 




 **BET YOUR BOTTOM DOLLAR**- shit, wrong film. 




 No, it *is* two days ago. 




 What about a movie...that you drink?! 




 Three times too. 




 ayyytham lmao 




 Inhumans is IMO the most likely.    
    
Ant-Man? No. Civil War? Of course not. Benedoctor Cumberstrange? No. Guardians 2? Never. New Spider-Man? Slightly more likely, but not very. Thor 3? Loki's in it, so no. Infinity War Pt.1? Never. Black Panther? He'll already be an Avenger, so no. Captain Marvel? I'm going to say no. Infinity War Pt 2? Never in a million years.    
    
The last one on the slate is Inhumans - people might be fatigued enough to have stopped caring by this point. 




 That entire show is on YouTube via Marvel's official channel if anyone wants to marathon it. 




 Isn't he supposed to be in Civil War first, though? 




 Spider-Man: The New Avenger? I think it's too much. I was fine with The Spectacular Spider-Man 




 IGN listed that as their second least favourite ep of the series, for god knows why. Second LOST episode I ever watched. Loved it. 




 Does [the title track of Kid A](https://youtu.be/7RwvZSfLUXM) *not* make *anyone else* want to kill themselves? Probably the most emotionally draining piece of music I've ever heard.    
Aside from that, [Optimistic](https://youtu.be/-q4zz6HvdiM), [Idioteque](https://youtu.be/DNqv3nHyteM), [Packt Like Sardines](https://youtu.be/RU8slEG-OtM), [You and Whose Army?](https://youtu.be/gAUMgureA6o) and [Life in a Glasshouse](https://youtu.be/upl_rxmsu6s) are some of the most refreshing alternative rock, electronic or jazz songs out there. 




 Most of the Ultron trailer monologuing was trailer-exclusive. In the first trailer, he's terrifying, whereas in the movie, he's simply very serviceably menacing rather than scary. 




 Oooooops I apologise 




 Scarlet Witch, though a bit bland, was fantastic to look at. 




 He loved Guardians, so I guess he's warming up to them. 




 There's a lot less blue, though. 




 (edit: fixed line)    
*I'm gonna show you something beautiful: everyone screaming...for mercy.*    
If only that line was actually in the movie... 




 What spelling errors? 




 But that random shot of a Gillette branded shaving cream bottle in front, out of focus while [spoilers](#s "Widow reveals she was sterilised")... A bit distracting. 




 Hate to be that guy, but you accidentally put *Rises* in the title. 




 In NZ and Aus, it's only an M - our equivalent of PG-13. No age restriction, just recommended for more mature audiences. Same with the two sequels, plus all of the Terminator movies, and the second Alien movie. 




 OR it's the quirky sequel to Falling Down. 




 SPIDER-MAN DIES, TONY AND BRUCE GET MARRIED, RHODEY GETS A SEX CHANGE.   
Oops, spoilers 




 Are you *sure* about NZ?!     
Edit: nope, not NZ. 




 Please, please fix the spelling  




 And, if you went along with the bonkers turn the show took, Season 5. Two cliffhangers - both mind-blowing. 




 Yep, I believe I recall all of those featured in the movie. 




 [Apparently it's not pan and scan, but a legit transfer.](http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/23/8486441/netflix-begins-streaming-the-x-files-in-hd) 




 Rick Sanchez? 




 Especially with Avengers coming out very soon, which basically everyone will have ended up seeing. 




 Could anyone send me another link? Twitter is blocked where I am. 




 *Would you like a alcohol?* 




 Down to 85 now 




 Giacchino's *Lost* score is a masterpiece. I'd die happy if he came to score an MCU flick. 




 In the SchmoesKnow review, Kristian said he enjoyed it even more the second time and gave it a better rating than he did in this video.    
Better the second time?! That's a good sign. 




 *I went to the stock market today. I did a business* 




 Kiwi here, it definitely isn't legal. 




 I'm the same - the concept of a larger film universe excites me, but the first film wasn't much more than a fun playful romp. The dramatic tone from the promos makes it look tense as *** - that's what I'm pumped for. 




 Maybe they didn't want to say what Vision does because it would be a spoiler whatever it was? 




 Mostly positive. Kristian gave it 4.2/5, Mark gave it 4.75/5.     
Their main gripes are the strange "Russian" accents and apparently not much of a lead-up to Civil War.    
Let's keep the hype train going! 









 r.i.p. op 




 WHERE IS HE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING? 




 It's been added to the dictionary too. 




 Um, this looks fucking awesome. Saved. 




 *a problem with Lost, not 'the' problem.  




 Pitch Perfect - not a musical. Music-centred comedy, but no breaking into song and dancing in public :) 




 AHH LUV U, PENNEH 




 TETSUOOOOOOOOOOO! 




 Same animators iirc 




 Lost. Despite anything you may say about how well it wrapped up, it's so goddamn complex. Characters show up in several people's flashbacks, sometimes super ambiguously. Locke v Ben, Locke v Jack, Jack v Christian etc. are great conflicts. Questions of right v wrong, power dynamics, vengeance, and the boundaries of redemption, are constantly brought up.    
What starts off as a thriller about a plane crash becomes philosophical as hell.    
Sure, the sci-fi/fantasy elements don't tie together well at the end, but 85+% of the show is spent developing and utilising its characters. Their story is tied up well. In those terms, the show is brilliant.    
    
The real reason the show is talked down upon is because you can't debate or podcast as well about character as you can about the various mysteries - this aspect of the show was severely overhyped, and still is in terms of the show's overall "disappointment factor" in a sense. If that's all you focus on you're bound to be disappointed, but there's much more to this show than that. 




 But Sayid, Sun and Jin...
