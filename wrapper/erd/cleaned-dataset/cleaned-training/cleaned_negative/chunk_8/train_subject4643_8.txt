 Most of the scenes are blurry. You can clearly see that too much  edge-enhancement has been used. 




 Absolutely ! 




 Quality Boxset for sure. 









 Heat had the worst transfer I had seen. I hear the last two Terminator transfers are pretty bad too.

 The trailers were rather bland compared to the movie. They took all the generic 'what you see in a kids movie' bits and edited them into the trailer. And yes, he was fisgustingly polite than awkward.

 **Official Synopsis :**

In Alcon Entertainments fast-paced, high-adrenaline action thriller Point Break, a young FBI agent, Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey), infiltrates a cunning team of thrill seeking elite athletes, led by the charismatic Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez). The athletes are suspected of carrying out a string of staggering crimes that kill innocent people and send the worlds economy into a tailspin.

Deep undercover, and with his life in imminent danger, Utah strives to prove they are the callous architects of these inconceivable crimes.

The film is replete with the most daring athleticism ever seen in a motion picture. These action adventure feats are performed by extreme athletes representing the worlds best in class in big-wave surfing, wingsuit flying, sheer-face snowboarding, free rock climbing, and high-speed motorcycling.
