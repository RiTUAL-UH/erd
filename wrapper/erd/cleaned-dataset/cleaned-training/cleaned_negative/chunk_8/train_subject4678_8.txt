 haha this is great 




 favourite film so far this year  
watching fury road was like reading heavy metal when i was 13. 




 i already deleted everything sorry! plus, the full hd version didn't look that great. 









 I thought the same thing. biggest problem I have is there is not a lot of movement in the clouds to begin with and these frames are at the end of a long zoom shot. No idea how to make it work, but I would love to learn how if any of the more exp cinemagraphers have any thoughts or suggestions. 




 Heh these are great! Glad to see a fellow fan making gifs of the show

 She was also in Freaks and Geeks as Bill Haverchuck's mom. I was watching FnG with a friend who told me that, and that's how I met your mother. I mean that's how I got into Babylon 5. Also, Delenn showed up in Lost as that mad Frenchwoman.
