 Read about Texas shelters elsewhere in this thread: that cat had zero chance there. It's precisely that the family did NOT try to find him a new home that angers some of us. 




  it's not their responsibility. 

Yes, it is. Just like very other aspect of the deceased's life that is now theirs to sort out -- but more so, because this "heirloom" is alive and sentient. They had a responsibility to try harder to place the cat, at least in a foster home, before dumping it at a kill shelter. 




 They could ASK for advice before dumping. And that advice will always be the same: commit to finding him a new home, and in the meantime, let's work together to find him a foster home.

Adding, the events that cause people to dump cats are almost never as sudden as the dumpers make them out to be. They just chose to ignore signs and refused to make contingency plans, then plead necessity where little of that actually exists. 




 What would you have them do if they could no longer provide a good home? 

Spend the time to recruit another family for him. It's doable; it just takes more time than people like this consider convenient. If they have to part ways with the cat immediately, they could place him in a foster home, then continue to work on finding a permanent placement. This goes on every day, where cat owners bother to think through their "sudden problem" and thus realize that others have  faced the same challenges before and found answers.

 I was there, about 50 feet from this scene, and know the people involved. This guy's whole rant is anti-gay. He comes to this same progressive festival every year, and that's all he rants about. The girl is smart and educated and knew exactly what this was all about -- she *wanted* to do this, all on her own. The girl's father (who shot the video) responded in several other reddits and on Facebook, and has been extensively quoted in press coverage of the viral phenom. Then the OP here leaves out the credits, and the same damn argument starts up again ... 




 No, that's exactly and only what he was ranting about. I was there. It's a progressive festival that he tries to disrupt every year. 




 The father (who shot the video) is a redditor who has posted elsewhere about this: the girl understands the issue very well and asked to do this. The only reason you haven't seen that is because the OP here ripped off the video and failed to link to the original post.

 My apology for this. I wasn't awake yet, and thought it was a different subreddit. I'll be more careful. 




 I think it's always a matter for public concern when an elected official has so little understanding of freedom of speech.

Also, this particular newspaper has historically banned reporters from using words as inoffensive as "vomit" -- the preferred usage as late as the early 2000s was "sick to one's stomach". So when things  in county government heat up like this, it's fun to see them struggle.  









 You're not "retarded" -- that's a completely offensive usage -- you're lazy. If you can't be bothered to do the most basic review of the largest collection of articles about this subject anywhere on reddit, why should someone else be expected to chew your food for you and hand it to you on a silver spoon? 




 There is no universe in which Joe Biden could ever be called a nonentity.  




 Everybody knows that. But biggest != best, let alone most expensive. I see no evidence of art in RWB; that costs extra. I grew up watching the [Grucci family](http://www.grucci.com/home.html?pgid=1) displays, and there's  just no comparison. If you doubt that, you can see the Grucci standard at work in the NYC and Boston displays on TV tonight. 




 Also possible: the fireworks technicians may have a higher-paying job for a bigger city tomorrow night. In the northeast when I was growing up, we were always aware of which fireworks display company was working which night for what city. I don't know anything about that scene in Ohio. 




 Do your research!

 The Columbus Quest turned me into a sports fan. We were dead broke at the time, but managed to scrape together enough for season tickets, and it was the best decision ever. Katie Smith alone was worth the price of admission, let alone Pee-Wee Johnson. What a great, under-appreciated part of Columbus history that was. 




 Why don't you read the comments before posting? It's been made abundantly clear that the OP is the photographer, that this happened at a progressive festival where everybody except the preacher was celebrating the SCOTUS decision, and that many people in this thread were also there.

Meanwhile: Mennonites are cool. There are many here, active in peace work. 




  This wasn't a political event, it's an annual music festival. 

Well, actually it is a *very* political event, because [Community Festival is all about promoting progressive politics](http://www.comfest.com/purpose.php) including, prominently, gay rights. But it's a celebration of those politics, and the anti-gay jerk was only there at all because he has a constitutional right to speak and a habit of suing over that. 




  I wouldn't take my kid at that girl's age to either event

That's your choice, because it's your family. But plenty of other families are built differently, on the belief that it's better to encounter and explain difference and diversity than to pretend children can be "protected" from things that require the parents to think hard and talk carefully. For those parents, and there are more of them every day, Community Festival *is* family friendly.

Adding, people who love to hate ComFest keep circulating claims about degenerate activities happening there that nobody who works the entire fest every year has *ever* encountered. Remember, organizers have to answer to the CPD, the neighbors and the insurance company, so we log every single bad incident and discuss them all in a public meeting. 

There are always a lot of rumors floating around, but the malicious lies are just ridiculous. If even 0.01% of them were true, the City would never let the festival happen. Instead, what happens is that police officers compete for a chance to work the fest, because *this is the safest event of its size in central Ohio*. 

Maybe it's time to pick a target for your rage that is actually guilty of something you can document.

  Its definitely not a "family festival" as some want you to believe

Tell that to the hundreds of families bring their kids to ComFest every year and rave about it.  Your view is obviously based on rumor and never exploring the whole fest.

Community Festival has a hugely popular KidsART program, which begins with kids designing entries for a contest to choose their own version of the official volunteer T-shirt (the design this year was awesome). Older children teach younger kids to make tie-dye; musicians teach songs and  how to play instruments, and the ComFest Museum exhibit is always packed with wide-eyed kids listening to docents.

You should come back next year with an open mind. You'll eat your words, no doubt about it.  




 I might have used "nibbling"-- but really, the concern was that this post might get deleted by mods for *sounding like* what they call "sad content", which of course it isn't.

 In the early 1970s, female retail entrepreneurs were a real rarity.  




 You think *you're* disgusted by the change? Ask anybody who was old enough to see the previous tenant evicted. [Tradewinds](http://www.columbusart.com/artscene/tradewinds.html) was the original campus area source for all those things plus import clothing and furnishings, gifts and alternative reading, from underground comics to underground newspapers. Both ComFest and the Columbus Free Press (in its earlier, saner incarnation) had deep roots in Tradewinds, whose female owners made all kinds of of street people, marginal characters, rebels and goofballs feel welcome. The demise of Tradewinds was considered by many area residents as the last straw in the University Partners takeover, the end of an era of independent shops along High near OSU. Students now can't begin to imagine what a  vibrant, creative scene existed there, and it's a damn shame.  




 Okay, the day of the week thing cinches it. The year not appearing on the leaflet itself is actually pretty common for the mid-70s. I still recall a fairly large demo for which the first print run failed to include any date at all -- it's hard now to imagine being so wrapped up in the moment and the issue that one could make such a mistake, but it happened a lot in the heat of the times.

Thanks for making the effort to sort out my confusion about this one. 




 Yes, I saw that -- but that's for a different leaflet, about a campaign that went on for many years. And it includes the kind of design and production that jibes with 1976, which is noticeably different from those in the OP's linked poster. YAWF always had a very recognizable graphic style, which became more sophisticated as they went along. The OP's link shows the later style with less text and larger graphics, but retains the use of Cooper Black typeface, so it can't be *very* far into the 80s, but I still think this is a later piece from the same campaign, not one from the first year of the campaign.

Of course, the simplest thing to do would be to ask the organization itself, which still exists as [The Party for Liberation and Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_for_Socialism_and_Liberation) -- or better yet, ask some of the people involved at that time. Trying to figure things like this out without the participation of the people who were there at the time is just silly. This isn't really ancient history, and they're a great living resource. 




 How are you getting 1976 from this? The politics and design look more like early 80s. 




 Logistics are handled by people who hold leadership positions in the major operational sectors -- it's not a committee anybody can just walk in and join, but an executive committee that implements ideas developed by the whole group.

 I'm sorry to seem rude, but I have to ask: if you know so little about the region and its people that you have to throw this very basic question out to a bunch of strangers, what makes you qualified to write for publication on this subject? Do you have any idea how many books are published every year on this subject by people with deep, longstanding ties to the subject? I'm guessing not, because you haven't cited any of them, including the ones that list the very info you seek here.

As an editor, I would turn down this pitch in a New York second. Unless this is headed for a vanity press (where the author pays the publisher), I don't see any book that starts out this way being publishable.

 The turf gets saturated, then torn up simply by people walking on it, never mind the golf carts that are necessary to run the fest. There's no remedy except to fence it off and wait for the ground to dry.

Ground at Bozo, Gazebo, Solar and Live Arts stages   Peace Village has been deemed too fragile to reopen those venues.

The rain damaged the park, but not as badly as last year thanks to festival participants who heeded requests to spare the turf. Here's the story as of this morning:

*ALL Street Fair vendors are open for business  
*ALL beer booths are open for business  
*All Volunteers are asked to report at their scheduled times   
*JAZZ stage and OFF RAMP Stage are both open as scheduled    
*GAZEBO stage acts are appearing at Park Street Tavern

 Remember those insufficiently stringent campaign finance laws? They're stringent enough to make something like this a major headache. Better read up on reporting, limits, bundling, etc.

 The FBI and DoJ distinction between homegrown and domestic terrorism is a political creation and should be ended. The homegrown classification locates Muslims as foreign agents operating in the U.S., not as part of the social fabric of this country. The portrayal of U.S. Muslims as potential or actual representatives of global jihad is used to justify the denial of constitutional protections and leads to representing ordinary menasking religious questions, criticizing the U.S. government, or even going camping with their friendsas a threat to society. It is past time to apply the same constitutional protections to everyone, and develop a response to terrorism based in analysis of patterns of violence instead of political costs and benefits.

That's because the working federal definition of terrorism was reworked twice since then, and for most of that time domestic terrorism was not so defined, nor an enforcement priority. Events have required a course correction, and it now is recognized for what it always has been.

In any case, vandalism against cars legally parked on a public street is not the answer. I hope you pushed back when told about this plan. 




 You're welcome to try that notion out on the Joint Terrorism Task Force, which does regard this type of crime as terrorism. 




  This was a lone wolf type of crime, not a group or movement

"Lone wolf" crimes committed by white supremacists absolutely are part of a movement. This tactic was popularized by KKK leader Louis Beam in the 1980s as an extension of the "leaderless resistance" strategy proposed in the 1960s by Col. Ulius Louis Amoss to fight the alleged communist takeover of the US. In recent years the term has been extended almost beyond meaning by sloppy use in the popular press. But it is understood both by its adherents and by anti-terrorism LEOs as meaning exactly what it always meant: a paper-thin veneer of "plausible deniability" meant to conceal the existence of a white supremacist movement waging war on democratic rights.

Thre is a ton of material available online about this, but [here's a primer](http://www.publiceye.org/liberty/terrorism/insurgency/leaderless-resistance.html). 




 Some things to keep in mind: there are multiple agencies involved in policing this event, not all of which are willing to meet with organizers in advance, not all of which have the same priorities about what to police. Big props are due to the CPD, who overall do a great job. Last year, there was miscommunication about how to close in the middle of a downpour, complicated by a rumor (untrue) that an officer had been attacked. That won't happen again.

Also, remember that most of these citations and arrests are for really egregious violations of state laws, and many are for illegal drinking.
On the numbers *and* in the view of police, ComFest is consistently one of the safest major public events in Columbus. 

Those who are seriously concerned about policing should come to the Solar Stage at 4:55 PM Saturday for a workshop on police accountability, featuring organizers of the campaign for a civilian review board along with several attorneys who have spent decades representing victims of police misconduct -- and a retired CPD officer with long experience at ComFest. 




 You clearly have no idea how much money and hard work the festival organization does in Goodale Park -- planting trees, flowers and grass; upgrading the electric grid; helping to pay for bike stands and the fountain, etc. The park wouldn't be half as nice if ComFest hadn't spent the last 34 years working on it. Ask Friends Of Goodale Park if they want it gone. Ask any of the business groups in the area if they want it gone. 

Every year, the festival organizers have to get local residents to sign off on the permit -- and what that shows is that your opinion is in the tiny minority of whiners; most local residents love the fest.

 No, every newspaper gets that sort of complaints from readers. Most major dailies don't answer such crank complaints in front of the whole readership, under the editor's name, on the front page of the second section, week after week after week. This column has been an embarrassment for the Dispatch for years -- it makes the paper sound like a small town weekly, and shows Marrison as unbelievably thin-skinned.

The new editor, Alan Miller, may not continue this tradition, but brings other baggage. He's  a careerist, and so insecure that he once used his position as head of the Ohio Legislative Correspondents Association to ban reporters from alternative weeklies  -- who had been eating the Dispatch's lunch at professional awards ceremonies -- from the Statehouse press room.

We're farther than ever from having the paper Columbus needs.  




 You're kidding, right? The biggest offsite viewing area for RWB is Goodale Park, and every year the crowds leave literally tons of trash when they depart. If you never noticed that, it's because for many years ComFest volunteers did the cleanup for that, too. 
 




 Before you take the word of the single most negative troll in this subreddit, do yourself a favor and read about Community Festival. 

This is the fest that has won so many awards for "best festival in central Ohio" that the paid staff of other fests joke about giving ComFest an all-time award and taking it out of contention just to give others a chance. It's the fest that annually motivates 1,700 volunteers to work for free running six stages with over 250 performances and workshops. It's the organization that gives thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of labor to keep Goodale Park green and blooming, and leaves the park pristine when the fest is over (unlike virtually every other festival in town). These are the folks who take nothing for themselves but give back profits from the event as grants to dozens of community organizations. 

You can read what the organization does,and why, at [the ComFest website](http://comfest.com), and find plenty of praise for the event just by searching for past news coverage. But the best way to learn how wrong the OP is would be to just come on down to this free event next weekend. You can find all the details about transportation, hours, performances, etc in the [2015 Community Festival Program Guide](http://www.comfest.com/program-guide.php), and read about the fest's history in the [40th anniversary commemorative book published in 2012](http://athensmessenger.com/app/emag/ComfestXL/ComfestXL.swf).

EDIT: removed true but tangential statement about OP in order to keep the focus where it belongs.

 There's one red flag that should have stopped anybody who looked at the website in their tracks: No Board of Directors is listed. This is the fastest shortcut to figuring out who's behind a new organization, and  in this case it just isn't there.

This group is doing most of their outreach through Facebook, where they ask for signatures on on after another "petition", "birthday card" or "thank you message". Given all the evidence, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that this is primarily a list-building operation, not an activist group.   









 I experienced a good illustration of how powerful muscle memory can be when I went to the Post Office recently to pick up mail from a box that I use only once a year (other folks in the same org use it the rest of the time): I didn't have the box number with me, so I just stood approximately where I remembered standing last year and *automatically* put the key into the right lock on the first try. I only thought to try that because I'd just seen some TV rerun in which a person who couldn't remember his name was handed a pen and paper and asked to sign his name. 

Muscle memory is real, and powerful, and weird.  




 What is your problem? 




 Say what?

 What about Macintosh apples? I bought a bag last fall that looked good, but were red inside like this and tasted odd. The next bag was fine, white all the way through and with that characteristic Mac taste. 




 It sounds like he's annoyed that you're brushing him while he's eating. Both of those activities are pleasurable, but together they may be just too much stimulation. 









 Who complained? 














 You talk about *watching* and *witnessing* what goes on -- how about that other choice, to work to improve the culture of the site? 




 One thing  you can do to help them get adopted is to take LOTS of pictures, especially portraits of the individual kittens. Then circulate those, relentlessly, as the kittens grow up. With luck you'll have a "reservation" for each kitten before they're old enough to leave mom -- and you'll be able to relive their kittenhood again and again, without the hassle. 




  I'm tired of reddit being not much more than circlejerks, memes, and advertising. 

It isn't that, if you choose your subscriptions carefully and avoid most of the defaults -- especially /r/all. If you do it right, reading your own front page plus your "friends" page can be amazing and not at all annoying. 




 Yes, that was 2010. The link I gave is *five years later* -- five critical growth years for Columbus. But even if there had been no change, 5.6% is not insignificant. The Dispatch thought this was an audience segment worth catering to; the fact that they did it so badly as to be unsustainable doesn't undercut the segment's growing importance.  




 I love the fact that sane redditors don't know about the "huge storm" raging in /r/all and some default reddits. This is about the admins' decision to ban subreddits like /r/FatPeopleHate whose subscribers had been taking their hate outside their home cesspool and going around to brigade other reddits. Since it's June, and millions of  teenage redditors have nothing better to do, they decided this was an unconscionable betrayal of reddit's supposed function as a free speech forum, and issued a call to arms against the admins. When nobody answered, they announced a mass exodus to voat. 

The only people who noticed were clickbait parasites like DailyDot and the British tabloids, who don't even know how the site works. It's been a bit more hilarious than the usual June reddit freakout. 




 It's not a meetup, but if he wants to meet more paramedics he might want to spend part of the weekend of June 26-28 volunteering for First Aid at Community Festival.  For volunteers, they need people with current certification in 1st Aid and CPR, or who have equivalent or superior certification  /or training  /or professional experience. 

It's a great way to meet people. The main First Aid station is located in the center of the park, so he'd get to talk to all sorts of people passing by, not just the sick ones. Every shift includes Fire/EMS workers, so that's another bunch of folks to meet. And when he gets off his 4-hour shift, he's already in the middle of the city's best party!

 You have to be kidding.

 No, but I hear absolutely *dozens* of teenagers have done so.  




 Every single one of those incidents put SAR rangers in danger, and everybody involved -- at all the parks -- is grateful for anything that might reduce this unnecessary risk. If you've never read it, [this book](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ranger-confidential-andrea-lankford/1110833684?ean=9780762752638) can help understand what it's like to be on the other side of dealing with this "statistically insignificant minority" of hikers. 




  If you can't score a permit for the main corridor campgrounds you could also try to get a permit for one of the other camping areas on other less popular trails that head down into the canyon.

This is not a good idea for any first-timer, let alone one who hasn't managed to locate the basic info about the Canyon. You correctly hiked the corridor trails, which should be the first step for any hiker.

Also, a lot has changed since 2008, including very prominently the demand for permits and the system for getting them. The increase in visitors is qualitative, with people showing up by the dozens or even hundreds to hike or run the corridor. There is so much demand now that there is serious consideration being given to instituting fees for every hiker who steps below the rim, whether they camp overnight or not. 

The answer to this is not for first-timers to try even the easiest of the lesser-known, less populated trails.  




 Nope. This particular group is so inept that their "secret" backing was exposed long before I encountered them.  




 I think I speak for many here when I say, "Wait -- Columbus has a *flag?*"  




 Just don't go getting involved with the GoTopless group -- they're a front for the [Raelian UFO cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%ABlism).  




 Yes, you need a permit, and no, you don't have much chance of getting one at this point. Permits for October (a prime weather time) are already gone, having been grabbed up a month ago. There is a slight possibility that you could catch a cancellation, but you're going to be doing the corridor, and those are the most popular sites, so it's a very, very slight chance.

I'd offer more hope, but frankly it doesn't sound like you've done much thinking or research about this. How hard can it be to read the official website for the park, where all this is laid out in user-friendly fashion? I'm sorry to sound harsh, but what you're talking about is not a stroll in the park.

Go read the official website and check out kaibab.org, then come back and tell us more about your level of fitness, backpacking experience, etc. Then we can help you. 
 




 Yep: they're the problem, and the proof that no amount of signage or literature *at the site* makes much of a difference. They're why NPS initiated a whole new job category: *Preventive* Search and Rescue. These are the folks who stand at the trailhead and try to convince unprepared hikers to rethink. But even they have only limited success, and they don't have the legal ability to stop anybody, even the most unprepared. All they can do is try to talk these folks out of going ahead, thanks to some jerk who litigated for the right to be stupid. That's why I'm always happy to see any article that might cut down, even slightly, on the number of preventable tragedies.   




 Okay, that explains it. I've never used AdBlock. I just got in the habit of ignoring ads 20 years ago, so never saw the need for it. 




 Thanks for the reply. I thought you were saying the article was unnecessary. I'm happy to be wrong about that.  




 Can we see a picture of Patches? 




 Er, Charlie is a female ....? 




 Your premise is deeply flawed, so it's really not possible to answer. Some people don't like jazz, just as some people don't like rock or hiphop or classical music. But there's no evidence of any large number of people who *hate* jazz. The account you linked to seems designed to troll, for what reason nobody knows. In any case, that's one person,not a trend. 




  Nobody is experienced at this without first being one of the inexperienced nitwits. 

Not every first timer is a nitwit. Some take the time to read about what they plan to do, and ask those more experienced. Just because this mass audience article doesn't speak to you doesn't mean that it won't speak to others who would otherwise have continued as nitwits.

After 20 years hiking GCNP, I'm always glad to see this kind of preventive outreach, no matter how clumsy the style. *Any* such effort beats having to intercept unprepared hikers at the trailhead to try to convince them not to go ahead on a hike that *will* result in having to send SAR after them later. 




 No, it's not. 




 Outside the newsroom, Mr. Carroll was an eloquent and unapologetic defender of the ideals of journalism at a time of revolutionary change in the media industry. He saw editors and reporters almost as public servants and a free press as essential to a self-governing nation. In recent years, he watched with growing concern as the changing dynamics of the news business threatened basic journalistic values like deep reporting and patient persistence  rock-turning, as he called it.

Todays journalists are constantly being reminded that they are functionaries of business, yet they know in their hearts that the stock price is a hollow god, Mr. Carroll said in accepting the National Press Foundations Editor of the Year award in 1998. They sense that newspaper work can, and should, be a wonderfully satisfying and entertaining way to engage the world, and that in a free society there is no mightier sword than the written word.

 If you're going to be concerned about human trafficking, it's a good idea to double check any stats you read. The overwhelming majority of humans trafficked are *not* sex workers but agricultural, industrial or domestic workers. The reason you see so much about sex trafficking (which is a real but much smaller problem) is because the loudest voices on this are evangelical Christian groups that frame the issue in ways that serve their mission. Some of these evangelical groups write about the issue in a way that intentionally blurs a reader's understanding of which numbers are for all trafficking and which are for sex trafficking

Most NGOs working on the issue of human trafficking reject the model used by these groups, which focus on "rescue" of individuals (almost always women) rather than focusing on changing the economic inequality that forces people into sexual [or other] slavery. 

So please take this *whole* issue as seriously as it deserves, and be sure to read the critiques of those who were working on the big picture before American evangelicals saw their opportunity to use this one aspect to raise money and recruit well-intentioned suburban teenagers.
