 To add to other comments here, I kinda doubt you have a good enough grasp of linguistics to come up with good research questions. Coming up with good modern research ideas is really hard, especially without feedback from peers or advisors, not to mention your inexperience in methods and in the writing expectations of your discipline. I mean, I don't know what it is, but often I'll come up with an idea that sounds great to me, come back to it in a few months, and then either think it's not that great anymore or find out someone else already came up with the same idea years ago. tl;dr I kinda doubt you know enough to know what you don't know, and more to the point, what the field doesn't know. 




 I think it's a perfectly fine hypothesis to test, but as far as I can tell the tests of its predictions have been mostly negative.

Agreed.

I'm glad someone's doing the experiments, even if the results are negative, negative results are still good science. My intuition is that the explanation is not really genetic or adaptive, and that we need a better understanding of the developmental biology, neurobiology, and sociocultural aspects of sexuality. So I agree that those researchers are probably going down the wrong path to understanding the biology of homosexuality.

Fun Fact: Apparently 23andMe did a GWAS of sexual identity on over 20,000 individuals and didn't find any associated SNPs. 




 Did the drug switch help? 




 They're both western homages to the magical girl anime genre, e.g. Sailor Moon, Revolutionary Girl Utena. It's funny because Steven is basically, boy as magical girl but with all the character traits you'd expect like innocence, naivette, and a heart of gold, while Bee is basically, 20 something slacker temp worker adult as magical girl subverting the common magical girl character traits. Also, both Natasha Allegri and Rebecca Sugar worked on Adventure Time. It's basically two different versions of Magical Girl Adventure Time. 




 Goodnight has some interesting work in spiders also. I think I hold the same opinion as most kin selectionists: group selection, in it's current form, is theoretically sound, but has not been as useful in practice except in a few isolated examples, but I admit that it is also because partly due to sociocultural and historical reasons. I also think we're getting too far from the topic at hand. 




 I've read Nowak et al., the responses, the counter-responses, and most of the other commentaries on the subject. I agree that everyone agrees group selection is theoretically sound, even if they disagree on whether it is a useful perspective in practice or not. Pruitt and Goodnight have some fascinating empirical work on group selection. 




 Group selection is theoretically sound, this is recognized by people in the field, even if they don't agree on it's practical advantages.

 Here are quotes from the first page results in google scholar for "homosexuality evolution kin selection" for All Time and Since 2011 (minus a few that I could not access or find "kin selection" in except in the references): Edit: Emphasis mine.

Barthes et al. 2013: "This **kin selection hypothesis has received little empirical support in Western societies and is still debated** (Bobrow   Bailey, 2001; Rahman   Hull, 2005; Vasey   VanderLaan, 2010)."

VanderLaan et al. 2015: "**Homosexual males who were feminine as children experienced elevated childhood concern for kin. [...] Future research should also examine whether kin-directed altruism helps offset fitness costs of same-sex sexual orientation**."

Vasey and VanderLaan et al. 2013: "**Overall, these tests indicate that the female kin of male androphiles produce more offspring than those of male gynephiles**."

Burri et al. 2015: "Theoretical and mathematical models have proposed two broad variants of balancing selection as putative compensatory mechanisms for human homosexuality: heterozygote advantage and sexually antagonistic selection. [...] Other behavioral data, e.g., on social preferences, which are relevant to **alternative evolutionary models for the maintenance of homosexuality (such as kin selection**, whereby gay relatives enhance the survival of their siblings offspring through caregiving or resource provision), **are also only available for men**."

Pfaus et al. 2012: "One such benefit could be related to kin selection (e.g., Wilson, 1975), as in the gay uncle hypothesis that **has received much attention but little empirical support in Westernculture (Bobrow   Bailey, 2001), although it appears to be supported among the Samoan** faafafine (Vasey   VanderLaan, 2010)"

Forrester, VanderLaan et al. Vasey 2011: "Consistent with the KSH and findings from Samoa, androphilic men exhibited a significantly greater cognitive dissociation between altruistic tendencies directed toward kin versus non-kin children relative to gynephilic men and androphilic women. **The present study, therefore, provides some tentative support for the KSH from a culture other than Samoa. Findings and future directions for research are considered within the context of the existing cross-cultural literature**."

Ablid et al. Vasey 2013: "**Support for this hypothesis has been garnered from studies conducted in Samoa, but not from studies of gay men in industrialized cultures** (i.e., Canada, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States). This cross-cultural difference may be due to relatively greater geographic and familial disconnect experienced by androphilic gay men in industrialized cultures. This article reasons that in more industrialized settings, friends children may serve as non-adaptive proxies for nieces and nephews. Hence, it was predicted that Canadian androphilic men would exhibit elevated altruistic tendencies toward their friends children compared with gynephilic men and androphilic women. **This prediction was not supported**."

Bobrow and Bailey 2011: "We tested the kin selection hypothesis of male homosexuality using questionnaire data in a community sample of homosexual and heterosexual men. **Homosexual men were no more likely than heterosexual men to channel resources toward family members**. Indeed, heterosexual men tended to give more financial resources to siblings than homosexual men. Furthermore, homosexual men were somewhat more estranged from family members, especially from fathers and oldest siblings."

Rahman et al. 2005: "The current investigation, following Bobrow and Bailey (2001), aimed to test the kin selection theory of homosexuality in human males using a survey design. A total of 60 heterosexual and 60 homosexual men from England [...] **Overall, little support was found for the kin selection theory in a community sample**."

and Rahman et al. 2005 Erratum: "It is worth noting that while the percentages in Tables 1, 2 appear to show a difference between heterosexual and homosexual men in the homosexual paternal line male relatives and homosexual paternal line female relatives (where homosexual men are not hypothesized to have more homosexual relatives), **the difference between the two groups is not actually statistically significant.**"

Camperio-Ciani et al. 2004: "Wilson (1975), attempting to solve the paradox, suggested a possible role for homosexuals as helpers in their families, increasing the fitnesses of their relatives and, thus, balancing their reduced direct fitness. However, both Muscarella (2000) and Bobrow   Bailey (2001) in recent empirical studies, showed that **homosexuals do not act as helpers and do not give more financial or emotional resources to siblings than do heterosexual men**. Other studies by R . Trivers (personnal communication), Rice (1998) and Miller (2000) have suggested the partial penetrance of a candidate homosexual genetic factor and hypothesized that pleiotropic or sexually antagonistic effects, acting on personality, increase fecundity in non-homosexual carriers, thereby balancing the reduction in homosexual fecundity (Miller 2000). No supportive evidence or empirical data, however, has yet been shown."

Vasey et al. 2007: "Although the greater avuncular tendencies of fa'afafine support the basic prediction of the Kin Selection Hypothesis for male androphilia, **further research is needed before one can conclude that these elevated tendencies represent a specially designed adaptation for promoting the fitness of kin**. We discuss a number of sociocultural factors that might promote the expression of avuncular tendencies by androphilic males in Independent Samoa."

Kirkpatric 2000: "Three adaptationist hypotheses are reviewed here and compared with the anthropological literature. There is little evidence that lineages gain reproductive advantage through offspring care provided by homosexual members. Therefore, **there is little support for the hypothesis that homosexuality evolved by kin selection**. Parents at times control childrens reproductive decisions and at times encourage children in homosexual behavior. There is therefore more support for the hypothesis of parental manipulation. Support is strongest, however, for the hypothesis that homosexual behavior comes from individual selection for reciprocal altruism."

Camperio-Ciani et al. 2008: "**Kin selection was earlier invoked [13], [16], [17], and later refuted [18], [19]**. Other suggestions followed, the more recent debate being broadly focused on three lines of argument, not all based on genetic factors: overdominance (i.e. male heterozygous advantage, [7], [20][22]), maternal effects on male offspring (such as maternal selection [23], or maternal genomic imprinting [9]), and sexually antagonistic selection [2], [13], [15], [24][27]."

So, it seems to me that the general consensus is that kin selection (in the context of homosexuality) is not well supported cross-cullturally, though there are supporters of kin selection, mainly the cluster within the discipline who work with the Samoan population. In other cultures, the evidence is negative or inconclusive. There is yet no quantitative test of the form of Hamilton's rule. Alternative evolutionary hypotheses, such as heterozygous advantage and sexually antagonistic selection, seem better supported than kin selection, although the jury is still out.

I would like to thank you though, the above exercise has been illuminating. If you have a rebuttal, I would be glad to hear it. 




  strawman fallacy and appealing to authority to back up your claims by attacking the two articles I happened to post.

How is this a strawman fallacy or appealing to authority? The two articles you posted in support of your claim do not support you claim. Who's authority am I appealing to? I didn't mention anyone's name. All I did was quote written passages from the two articles you posted. I also find this ironic coming from someone who earlier tried to legitimize their comments by appealing to authority; to quote, "I teach behavioral ecology at one of the top universities in the world."

 On the topic of logical fallacies, refuting a claim is not evidence for an alternative, agreed?

Yes, I never said otherwise.

 I provide evidence for my argument, but you provide nothing to support yours.

My argument was merely that the evidence you provided to support your argument does not actually support your argument. My evidence is to quote passages in both articles you supported which contradict your claim. I never attacked the two articles you posted, I quoted passages from their own text. Moreover, I clearly said that I was not supporting an alternative explanation.

 How about you provide some citations that rule out Hamiltonian models in favor of the several broad categories you offer?

I point you back to the same two papers you sourced.

 Offer something other than rudeness.

Where was I being rude? I said I'd be happy to read any papers you had that actually support the kin selection hypothesis for homosexuality.

 In what way is my analogy bad?

Because it is clear that the OP has some serious fundamental misconceptions about evolutionary theory, and your answer to their question was not even to explain kin selection in the context of homosexuality, but explain how it applies in a completely different context, and somehow expect the OP to draw a proper inference from the analogy, without the proper conceptual framework (i.e. kin selection) in which to properly map from one situation (eusocial insects and reproductive skew) to the other (human homosexuality).

Edit:
 What hasn't been tested? I'm unclear on what you're referring to.

I was referring to the group selection model the author proposed as an alternative to the four other evolutionary theories (including kin selection) the author reviewed. It was a minor point, so I didn't mention it above. 




 Haa seriously. All the low hanging fruit has been taken. I think the best place for new ideas is to think about what questions can now be asked with the most recent technological or methodological advances in your field. E.g. genome sequencing, opened up whole new ideas to research and new ways of looking at old ideas.  




 Thanks, very interesting! 




 Another way to think about it is to think about what kind of behavioral algorithms the bee might be using when it's trying to build combs. You lay out one circular comb, then the next best place to build a comb is tangential to the first comb you built, then you want to move just far enough from both combs to build another comb tangential to *both* of the combs you just built. The hexagonal packing of circles then is a natural consequence, even if the bee has no concept of the overall design, it's only acting based on asking: is this too close to the combs I can see around me, or is too far, or is it just right. But to build a square packing, the bee would have to have a concept of right angles from each other. The first one is intuitively more "natural" and is a much simpler and robust behavioral rule. The rule is just, move so that I am some fixed distance away from every cell that I can see around me, and build here.

I don't know of if this is actually what happens, but that's my hypothesis. 




 Yup, see my other post, that's exactly what happens. 




 So the thing is, they actually start out as circles, which get pulled into hexagonal shapes. Circles pack in the same way that hexagons tesselate the plane, but not squares or triangles. So to get a square tessellation from packed circles, the bees would have to pack circles in a square lattice, and then those circles would be pulled into square shapes, but such a packing is not ideal. Hexagons are a "natural" shape for packing things in a plane.

http://www.nature.com/news/how-honeycombs-can-build-themselves-1.13398 




 Because combs when built are actual packed circles, but due to surface tension at the joints, get pulled into hexagonal shapes. If you pack a bunch of circles, the centers don't line up with the centers of square or triangles when tessellated.

http://www.nature.com/news/how-honeycombs-can-build-themselves-1.13398 




  In order for this to work, every single baby step has to be beneficial to the species.

No, "benefit to the species" is never the evolutionary reason. 




 It's still a bad analogy with respect to the question that was asked and the level of misconception about evolution shown by the OP. It's a bad analogy, and a bad explanation of kin selection to someone who doesn't know kin selection, without any guidance on how the analogy is supposed to be interpreted in the context of human sexuality.

Ironically, the first article you posted says: "At the present time, there is no quantified statistics on the reproductive benefits of having a homosexual relative. Ultimately, kin selection seems a lot more evolutionarily plausible for female worker ants and bees (with their genetic peculiarity of being more closely related to the queens offspring than to any offspring of their own) than it does for homosexual human beings." To summarize, it reviews current evolutionary theories for homosexuality, and argues against the first four of five, while proposing a *potential* model of *group* selection, which while interesting, has not (to my knowledge) been tested.

And the second article says: "Previous research conducted in Western countries (U.S., UK) has failed to find any support for this hypothesis. In contrast, research conducted in Samoa has provided repeated support for it. In light of these cross-cultural differences, we hypothesized that the development of elevated avuncular (i.e., altruistic uncle-like) tendencies in androphilic males may be contingent on a relatively collectivistic cultural context. [...] The results of this study furnished no evidence that androphilic Japanese men exhibited elevated avuncular tendencies compared to their gynephilic counterparts." though there is evidence in Samoan and Polynesian cultures.

So neither paper you've cited supports your claim. I'm not saying there isn't evidence for a Hamiltonian hypothesis, but it isn't strong, and there are a number of competing evolutionary, sociocultural, and neurological/developmental models, among which there is not strong consensus around any single explanation. Though if you had better papers than the ones you listed, I'd be happy to read them. I have googled it in the past, and as far as I can tell, there's no consensus. 




 They don't, IIRC from a competitive food eating book I read years ago. One said the only time she ever puked was due to food poisoning. 




 Better than mouth stuck in penis. 




 No, that's a terrible analogy, and there just isn't that strong of evidence for a kin selection explanation for homosexuality. 




  There are probably many more homosexuals in the world today than say 200 years ago.

Well yeah, there are more people period than there were 200 years ago. Also, it's far more acceptable to be gay today than 200 years ago, so more people are out.

Nature doesn't "control" things, nature has no mind of it's own. There's no universal consciousness that thinks "oh, there are lots of people, we should make them less reproductive by making them gay."

Not to mention, there are a thousand other ways to reduce population growth, including contraceptives, sexed, empowering women, development. 




 There are a lot of misconceptions about evolution here. First, homosexuality did not evolve as a means to curb population. Trait's don't evolve because they help the species, traits only evolve because they help individuals compete against other individuals for reproductive success. There's no such thing as evolution acting "for the good of the species", because nature has no conscience or end goal.

The second main misconception is that all traits evolve because they are beneficial. This leads people to seek adaptive explanations for traits that aren't adaptive. Just because homosexuality exists in humans (and other species) does not mean it's advantageous (nor does it mean it's disadvantageous) for the individual/gene.

But let's assume homosexuality is evolutionarily beneficial, for whatever reason. Evolution is not a moral theory, it simply describes what happens in nature, it does not prescribe what *should* happen. Nature does not think nor does it plan, and so it has nothing to say about morality or ethics. Thus, evolution says nothing about how gay people *should* or *ought* to behave, and thus, it says nothing about how you should form an opinion about what *other* people *should* or *ought* to behave. I'll give you an analogy: Gravity describes how planets move and objects fall, it doesn't say that objects *should* fall and it doesn't say we shouldn't flying in planes because planes cause a lot of pollution. It simply describes the motion of objects, just as evolution describes the "motion" of genes through time.

Oh, and over-population has not been a problem for humankind until recently. But that's a minor quibble. 




 *, ELLEN?* 




 Only if we go extinct. 




 I haven't read it and only casually have followed the debates, but try "Evolution - The Extended Synthesis" by Pigliucci and Mueller. It presents the argument that the Modern Synthesis needs to be extended, which has its proponents and critics. Also check out the article "Does evolutionary theory need a rethink?" for a comment from the proponent side and a counter-comment from the critic side, since you should read about both perspectives. 




 ...I don't understand your question then. 




  Do you guys think it would be O.K if I submitted it to another journal and simply withheld the news until I got a response from that journal?

No that is *not* okay, since he's a co-author, he not only should be informed about the state of the paper out of courtesy, but also out of the fact that his name is on the paper. It's not like he's not going to find out, and why would you think it's better if he found out indirectly months from now? That's a terrible idea.

It's a rejection, so what, rejection is the norm not the exception. Your supervisor (presumably is) empathetic, and (presumably) wants to help you. He's been there probably countless times before.

The other thing to think is why wouldn't you make your paper better by incorporating the editor's feedback. Though this paper did not go to review, for papers that do and get rejected, a lot of the time if you send them to another journal, you'll get some of the same reviewers just because your field is small (yes?). Reviewers aren't gonna like to see the same paper again without any attempt at incorporating their previous feedback.

 Natural selection does not mean that drift does not occur at the selective locus; the gene frequency dynamics at the locus are the result of both deterministic (natural selection) and stochastic (drift) components. That is not to say the other guy/girl's logic makes any sense though... 




 Wait what? That made literally no sense. Neutral genes does not imply genetic drift, and genes under selection does not exclude genetic drift acting *on the selective locus*. 




 I don't understand your answer to your own question. There's no mention of fitness differences *correlated with genotype* on which selection can act, and there's also no mention of genetics or populations or frequencies which is what genetic drift describes, so it's neither a question about selection nor genetic drift. It's a terribly worded question. At best, it's a description of a fitness difference, but without describing some kind of covariance with some kind of inheritable character, it's not a description of natural selection. 









 No. 




 Yes, but for fun, let's propose some alternative hypotheses.

1) Rose has more defined hair in the first scene than the other two is because they wanted to make her look younger in the later scenes.

2) In the top right shot, this is during a motion frame, while all the others are during (near) static frames. Motion frames tend to have less details.

3) There are some differences in lighting, and also in distance to the camera.

 It's kinda a chicken or egg situation. If you grow up lacking access to healthier foods, your food preferences, habits, cooking skills, and food and health education will be determined by what food is available in your community. This makes it impossible for healthier alternatives to establish themselves in these same communities.

 Following up on the circumcision question: How does that work? How long after birth? Who performs it? Is there cake and merriment involved? 




 tl;dr Poor people are more likely to live in food deserts. 




 To add a little to my own answer, there are a few other reasons of historical contingency which at least made our lineage more likely to evolve towards such high intelligence; we're primates, which have a fairly high brain to body size ratio among mammals already, most of whom are social and arboreal (both behaviors requiring bigger brains), who are already good at manipulating the environment (we have pretty awesome forearms), and who felt the pressure of climate change in African savannah around 5-7 million years ago which pushed us towards bipedalism and endurance running, and we are one of but many evolutionary trials of hominid species, ranging from robust primarily plant eating species to gracile omnivores, and we happen to be the ones that survived, despite at some point numbering less than a 100k. The traits that make us who we are were already present in some form or another in the common ancestors of great apes, and we got lucky. 




 Off the top of my head, Laland, and Feldman. Try looking under evolutionary anthropology, mathematical anthropology, behavioral evolution, and sociobiology. 




 We're coming for you Indiana. 




 Unami 




  Since survival and reproduction are the most basic of all instincts, and intelligence has been the single most important factor that allowed us to overcome and dominate all other species on Earth and ensure optimal survival and reproduction, why hasn't any other species gone in the same direction?

Because evolution does not have a directed end goal. Intelligence has been very adaptive for us yes, but there is an infinite other ways of adapting which may be more fruitful. Smarter is not always better--all adaptations involve some kind of trade-off, and big brains are particularly expensive to pay for energetically speaking. Intelligence is really hard to make work in terms of cost vs benefits. 




  E E labs are more likely to earmark certain students to join their lab rather than just having a pool of students admitted to a program.

This is true, and is not necessarily a bad thing. I think "earmark" is an understatement; in many E E programs, it's pretty much a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for getting admitted that (at least one) PI wants you to join the program and their lab. The 'earmark' is the vast majority. Conversely, it means that applicants should apply with a particular research area and PI in mind whom they have already contacted. Fit is important for E E admissions. The best thing you can do to improve your chances of getting into an E E is to research potential PI and contact them about joining their lab before applying. (This can also save you the trouble of avoiding applying to programs where your potential PI isn't taking students or is moving to another institution). 




 Yeah, basically the ability for the gene regulatory system to adapt to new environmental inputs is itself hardcoded into the genes, albeit in a complex way. The only part of the criticism against the selfish gene that I may agree with (though I haven't given it much thought) is that the gene concept itself is poorly defined, especially in the face of complex nonadditive networks of gene interactions underlying phenotypic and thus fitness differences. 




  I've been using the undergrad rates as a rough guideline for lack of better information.

Don't, it's useless. You won't find any of that info online. It depends on how many and which advisors may be looking for new students which depends on how well funded they are recently and also the preferences of labs and programs for cohort size and various departmental and institutional factors and also how well-known the institution and more importantly the program are and also how popular a particular field is at the moment. Sometimes programs are looking to expand, sometimes they have had recent hires who need grad students, sometimes they've had a change in chair or director of graduate studies, sometimes they're being squeezed by administration, sometimes they've had faculty who've left, sometimes they want to make up for low matriculation in the previous year, sometimes they want to make fewer offers because matriculation the previous year was high. The variance is large. 




 Only if you die a martyr. 




 It also helps to up the density of the atmosphere, the denser, the more 'aquatic' flying organisms will be. This also ties into the need to support a large mass with large energetic intakes; the largest real whales eat tonnes of tiny plankton, and similarly, either there should be some kind of `air' krill, seeds, or they descend to graze on canopies of flora, or they're some kind of photosynthetic. But yeah, the basic idea is similar to swim bladders in fish. The lighter than air gases could be produced by their microbiome. Defense is tricky, as bladders might be fragile, making them easy prey; bladder's would probably be modular.
