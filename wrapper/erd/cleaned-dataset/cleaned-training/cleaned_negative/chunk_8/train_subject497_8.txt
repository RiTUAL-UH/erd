 Hahaha :) Have you ever thought he could become quite "famous and successful" with just the way he is?! This is so great and restores my hope! 




 That's amazing. :) Louis is for sure very special! I'd love to hang out with him, anywhere random in the whole wide world and have a coffee! Such a laid back and interesting person... 




 FunForLouis!! :) He travels around the world and captures it with his camera. Lots of great shots and adventures to see! 




 Maybe she is not only concerned about whether something is effective, but also whether she is still in the right light? And maybe she just doesn't like, that you're doing good on your own (without her help), rather than *what* you are doing... 

It's good, you're not gonna give her more infos, it makes you and your projects less "vulnerable". But still keep an eye on her behaviour... manipulative people don't like it, when things don't go their way and could not only sabotage projects, but also damage reputations.

I'm glad, that you know what I meant with "distance"! :) And I genuinely hope things will work out great for you.
