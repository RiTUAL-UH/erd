good job 




 America has done about as good a job of policing the world as American Southern Cops in the 60's IMO 




 If you were born fearing being blown to bits every day, and the simple answer was "The Americans killed your neighbour, your friend, your brother" Who would you hate? 




 And Pinochet 




 So comparing one unelected individual to another is absurd. 




 Saudis are elected? lol

as for the other two, they murdered thousands of people, in Iraq or Gaza respectively, and targeted civilian areas, used uranium bullets etc 




 If you want to start jailing human rights abusers, start with Netanyahu, and Bush, and all the saud family.
