 I guess you could become butt buddies with a dev and get him to delete you from the database, or you could do it yourself but i'm guessing that's not an option if you're posting here. 




 Yeah.... I know; apparently reddit dosen't know the spoiler tag though.

 22 years of service and now hes a tour guide... */s* 




 So much cynicism on videos like this... sure he could have been a paid dancer but at the same time he could have just been a security guard that could dance having some fun. No need to act like a smartass about it, as if you have some inside info. Even if it was a plant, why are they trying to get the video viral? There's not even a product placement and the video isn't even on the colleges youtube - even if I wanted to buy a ticket to see him I have no idea where he is/who he works for. 




 Said a lot better here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Ke2bMYBFs#t=88 




 *Now* you're thinking like AAA game devs! 




 Never thought my fetish would show up on reddit...! 




 10/10 british impression 




  Urgh people wanting more money for producing free entertainment. What a drag. 




 I'm pretty sure saying totes unironically is cringeworthy too 




 How do they know if she's right..? I'd guess they have someone typing the numbers as she says them or? 




 I had good experiences with NordVPN, and i've heard Feral is a good seedbox. 




 Some say she's still looking for Terry. 




 That's the problem with the entirety of reddit.  




 I mean you're not wrong, probably should have included those details, but IMO it's still better than PTN because it dosent make my eyes hurt. 




 Frasier: You know the expression, "Living well is the best revenge"?

Niles: It's a wonderful expression. I just don't know how true it is. You don't see it turning up in a lot of opera plots. "Ludwig, maddened by the poisoning of his entire family, wreaks vengeance on Gunther in the third act by living well."

Frasier: All right, Niles.

Niles: "Whereupon Woton, upon discovering his deception, wreaks vengeance on Gunther in the third act again by living even better than the Duke."

Frasier: Oh, all right! 




 Better off without them IMO. If you're looking for a good ratioless movie tracker try out BeyondHD. It's really only 'semi' private but they have all the new releases and some good internal encoders (famestor,legion). On PTN, their site design is so astoundingly bad it boggles the mind how people can use it on a daily basis. 




 Waffles is probably a good first stop, they have a lot of recruitment threads all over the place, and the requirements are never too high. Of course Waffles is still #2 to What.cd, so you could invest the time to learn the interview for WCD, which is the largest music tracker (https://www.whatinterviewprep.com/). 




 Wait - it checks if for AV and if it's in a virtual machine? Dosen't a malware only do that if it's looking bypass/hide from one of them? 









 Its from the bottom of the dudes shoe.

 He's talking about BAN, never heard of it? Good, that's they way they like. (*/s*) 




 I love both and you are completely right. 




 what does the private key do? 




 can someone explain what the private key passphrase does? i assume it lets anyone simulate the cert or something? 




 Thanks! 




 Can someone explain this and the implications in laymens terms? 




 I mean it sort of is. Although i've never had anyone tell me this i'd just say its worth it if you like to torrent enough, pretty simple really, being able to download so much content easily outweights the 'work'. 




 
The newer versions of utorrent are filled with ads..maybe it was doing you a service.

http://filehippo.com/download_utorrent/9859/

Download this, it's the most reccomended older version of utorrent. If you still get a warning then theres a virus on your computer that's changing the download links. Switch to ESET Nod32 (Norton is a POS) and run a full scan. 




 yeah most to all isps will do this. just change providers or ask reallly nicely saying you wont do it again... 




 That's not asking for an invite, that's asking for where they recruit from. You're not allowed to ask for invites, you are allowed to ask where x tracker recruits from. As per https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/wiki/rules 




 The subreddit is empty. Read the message on the gate. Sounds like your experience has been jaded somehow, and I apologise on behalf of whoever did that. I sincerely hope you decide to try and get back in, as its a rewarding experience with good communities, whose requirements aren't nearly as bad as you make them out to be... i'm nearly 5 months in and i'm in pretty much every private tracker I want to be (music,games,movies,tv) Greetings. 




 You have no idea what you're talking about. GazelleGames is in comparison with something like PtP or BTN is extremely easy to get into. They even have a recruiting thread on bB (/r/baconbits) where you just need to be a member for 1 month and have a ratio of 1.05, which essentially means just being a member for a month. No waiting for a year like you said.

The reason most private trackers don't open for registration (I think) is because they want to control the number of users, but the large majority of them have invite threads on 'gateway' trackers that require nothing more than power user (again, trivial to get). 




 Little anecdote, i've never seen something so aggressively marketed, saw it all over public transport over here in the UK. Usually just see one or two posters, even for games like Assassin creed. This was actually plastered everywhere, it was so out of the ordinary for me. 




 GazelleGames seems to have a nice collection. 




 Common knowledge they only have one policeman in Japan. 




 Well, they're in there because they're British, but they win because your game is the best British game.

Their defenition of persistent is...wildly different.

I have no words for how stupid this is. 




 I don't know why but his voice sounds a lot better in this video. 




 WHAT'S SO FUNNY? WHATS SO FUCKING FUNNY!?!!?! 




 /r/humblebrag 




 If they emptied their clip on me before that I say fuck them and just shoot them. I'm not kniving only when its convienient for them lol. 




 Some people think you say it regardless, others only if it was a good game (e.g. I would not consider 5v1 a good game). There's quite a few in both camps of thought. 




 Best reply. 




 Mostly the former I think. Coupled with them probably not having enough people submit their games for awards. 




 "Shitty"... this is the most prestigious gaming award (if you take it in the context of the 'main' BAFTA's). It's the only gaming award show to be broadcasted on TV ,BBC3. One of the most popular channels. Although I agree if by shitty you mean the fact that LoL and Destiny are in the same catagory.

 Hi,

Looking for a new mouse, my lachesis just died on me after a few years (Razer). Is there anyone here that has the Kinzu/Rival and has big hands? I've gotten used to the lachesis which is pretty big.

Cheers 




 Any idea if any of those are ratio-less? 




 Hey,

After many years my lachesis finally gave up. Anyone that used the same mouse that knows of a good replacement? Preferably claw, needs to accomadate large hands.

Cheers. 




 You can eat some bacon raw. 




 What the fuck. 




 It's such a fucking weird pick for that catagory. All of my wat. 




 Also for Persistent World along with League of Legends...i'm so confused. 




 Good question. One i'm most confused about is League of Legends..... Dosen't the world 'reset' with every game played? They must be using a really broad defenition I guess. 




 With all the hype i could unfortunately see Destiny taking this, but i'll be cheering for EvE on the day! 









 I think the plate is 30 degrees below zero. 














 If only there was some way to turn down the sound.... hmmm... Let me get back to you on this, I think i'm onto something. 




 Astoundingly adorable. 




 You're asking the wrong question. What kind of cop dosen't stop every right minded person *from* buying a meerkat? 




 ComicBT recruits from bB. The requirements aren't that high either. /r/baconbits 




 Aaand its down 




 Except he dosen't play EvE anymore, lol. 




 I love how that one CT is so confused looking for it.. "It must be around here somewhere!" 




 Except he only talks about it in ts, while his friends say something through in-game VOIP once or twice. 




 Try watching the whole 45 minute game, or try to hear footsteps while that's playing. The kid also talked way too much. Plus they barely said anything rude to him, only on TS. 




 You should watch the whole game, it dosen't stop lol. And they never yell at him, only once does one of them say something negative about it in game and not in ts. 




 This is an uninformed opinion, but i'm guessing if a projectile can be fired from 10x the distance it can now it gives them a much larger engagement range, allowing them to be safter when attacking, or defend from farther away. 




 Script supervisor sounds like a cool job. 




 Awesome. 




 He's the antichrist. [S]atan. 




 My god have they ever heard of makeup? That dude looks like he hasn't slept in way too long. 




 Shoutout to /r/irlsmurfing ! Awesome sub. 




 Actually saw a guy holding a water gun in one of the other epsiodes.

 Are both HDA and AHD ratio based? 




 You almost qualify for a bB interview: /r/baconbits read the message. From there you only have to get elite for an invite to WCD, or you could get into Waffles by being power user (takes pretty much no effort) which is #2 to WCD. 




 Holy shit this is hilarious. 




 https://i.imgur.com/OoX8nAf.png probably still not a fitting picture though 




 Cool idea but the indifferent being on a different line fucked it up for me. 




 Ignore the dicks OP. It was readable but maybe a better font choice (sans serif?) and a white outline would have done it some justice. 




 I actually thought that was aaron rodgers for half the video. God damnit OP.

 Holy shit this picture is so trippy. It almost looks like a mirror or a printed out photo. 




 TS as in TorrentShack? 




 I use symbolic links to cross seed. Simply install this: http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html#contact and create a symbolic link of the file/folder, then use that for the other tracker. 




 Wasn't Aura the one on that soundcloud recording acting like a complete dickhead? 




 https://i.imgur.com/PHUyL6A.gif 




 then he should have never applied sorry (why even apply if you live in a completely different timezone, with even a remote possability of your schedule changing? what a waste.) 




 Speak for yourself, not me. 




 Wait how did they find out? Did you make the pastbin public? 




 Why do so many people leave the battle report out of the description T_T 




 You only need this one if you're in the CFC. 




 I swear these TLD's are getting out of hand.ninja 




 Just curious, not sure if you've stated anywhere else, is GGn being DDoS'd (I assume by IPT) or is it something else? 




 its fine just close your eyes - the emu's are onto something. 




 Uusally i'd agree, but this guy is shooting a portrait in portrait mode. I think that was what it was made for. 




 Yeah and make sure you persevere through learning the basics of the game (controls, navigation, etc.) that was the biggest learning curve for me. 




 Just out of curiosity, what's your average upload speed on a torrent (assuming just you seeding)? 




 Been down for like a week now, must be revamping that whole thing. 




 Or maybe she was just mentally ill? Or didn't mind taking responsibility for her actions? Or there were cops off camera and running would have made no sense? You're making a lot of assumptions for someone that knows almost nothing about the situation or the person. A true reddit detective. 




 Let's be real, we all did.  




 Made me laugh for the first time today. Thank you OP. 




 P...Poitot?
