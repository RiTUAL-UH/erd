 I've always wanted an M3, but I'll never get one unless I snag the lottery. I got kids to feed! 




  That it's pro-American. But it's their right don't you think? Do you think an American newspaper could or should stand against the power and strength of the United States?

WTF are you talking about? Seriously. See my other comment. It's not my subjective opinion. Read the articles, look at who the authors are. Look at what they cover, and what they don't.

[They admit it themselves that they are liberal](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2013/08/18/new-york-times-public-editor-admits-paper-has-liberal-bias)

And they only talk about Rove in the Opinion section - which btw they aren't always favorable to him. MSNBC is left of NYT is left of CNN is left of WSJ is left of FOX. 




  The New York Times is considered liberal by people who call New York City "Jew York City"

wtf? ALL of my conservative friends say it's left leaning by a wide margin, and never once have I heard 'Jew York City". You seem pretty ignorant. 

And any objective person will see NYT is liberal. So you are telling me delusional liberals want to think liberal sources are not liberal? That's cool, but they are still delusional. 

I mean, for crying out loud, one of their biggest contributers is Krugman, who is a HUGE liberal, not to mention all the anti-Israel positions they take on a consistent basis.

[A New York Times editor admitted they are a liberal newspaper](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2013/08/18/new-york-times-public-editor-admits-paper-has-liberal-bias)

Honestly it would be like saying Fox is a moderate news station. Anyone who thinks that is clearly biased and blind themselves. It's not as in-your-face liberal as MSNBC or HuffPo, but it certainly is liberal. 




  New York Times stands for the power and strength of the United States around the world

what are you saying? It's widely considered a left-leaning newspaper, just link WSJ is considered right-leaning. 

And I didn't say we should outlaw anything. I said that this sub-reddit has more of these left leaning sources than moderate or right-leaning sources. I never said we should 'outlaw them' 




 WP? Can't think of what that is. /r/politics is widely liberal, and most sources are left-leaning or completely Left sources. Vox, HuffPo, AJ, DailyBeast, NYT, Slate, and more. Oh WP - Washington Post. It's not liberal only, but it is surely liberal-leaning. Not as massively as HuffPo or something, but certainly liberal biased.  




 After going through this sub, you would think bernie would be higher 




  no doctor should fear for their lives for providing such services, nor should any women fear for her safety while seeking out such services

Um does that happen? 




 I should have clarified - it would be nice to see said sources on /r/politics, instead of seeing liberal-only sources on the front page.  




 Would be nice to have an anti-Walker from sources that aren't heavily liberal.  




 I'm not sure why he can't win the primary. His message should appeal to all the minorities and lower class. Does the lower class tend to now vote in primaries? 




 I would have to agree with that one... 




 Ha no problem. I didn't even notice your username. By the way the 'Join us on Slack' link produces an application error. Not sure if that is an issue with you or with slack. 




 www.Scotch.io has some really helpful articles. I went there for info on Sublime. They have some great tutorials. 




 So what about resale values of these manuals? 

Let's say for example that 2015 is the last year any BMW has manual. That means used 2015 models (and earlier ones) with manual transmission will have a much higher resale value.  




 One ting to note is that the resell value for used manual transmission cars will go up. Lets say 2016 is the last year that the BMW M3 comes in manual. That probably means the 2016 M3 will have great resell value - so will the 2015. 




 I think the problem is when you have years of no austerity, and then too much austerity. When it gets to this point, there isn't much you can do. 














 Yup. I'm surprised my net karma on /r/politics is actually positive. 




 By your logic, no one receives welfare, ever. I'm not getting welfare, its going to the corporations where I buy my groceries. I'm not getting welfare, its going to the corporation where I buy my gas... Etc.

It's pretty shitty logic. However yes, the value of the building doesn't matter if he is renting one of many units. 




 Many countries themselves ignore many UN rulings. They are hardly a binding force. But I don't really care what some body says. If it's illogical, its illogical. If it's stupid, its stupid. Doesn't make a difference who says it. 




 So... "because the UN said so" is your answer. 

Got it. 




 Basic human right? Your employer does not owe you shit. Should they do it? Sure, but calling it a 'basic human right' is just stupid. 




 You can probably find good reason to ban the flag of any country, as any country has probably committed some atrocity at some point in the past.  




 How about the American flag itself? That should be next. 




 Ya I saw the manga and that makes a lot more sense. Thanks for the info about the music. Had no idea. Even though the original dub is guilty of terrible dialogue doesn't mean kai isn't bad. It's just *not as bad*. 




  Killing the pride of Vegeta would be kind of ruining a character.

I'm not saying kill it. I'm saying tone it down. Even for his level of pride, it's a bit over the top. It's like, "in case you didn't understand Vegeta's character, here is another example..." over and over again 




 1. Not crazy about Gohan's voice in Kai. Just an opinion.

2. The music played during Cell's death was just normal music. It was such a letdown. In the original version, there was [this music](https://youtu.be/Ec6fR11dHUk?t=172), which I believe, is not used anywhere else. Hence, it's 'special music' used for cell's death. In Kai, the music used is plain music used throughout DBZ, including times when enemies simply stared at each other.

3. Goku and Gohan could have easily trained in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, **and gotten sufficient rest**. They had 9 days. So 4 days rest, 1 day in the chamber, and 4 days rest again. So the idea that Goku 'wanted to rest' doesn't really make sense. Then again, he knew Gohan was more than strong enough at that point, so maybe that's why he said that.

4. **Goku had plenty of time to use instant transmission to drop cell off, and return back to earth.** [There is PLENTY of time here](https://youtu.be/JMVTlYExFkY?t=117). That always bothered me. I mean he didn't even try.

5. The dialogues at times, are absolutely the most corny/forced/lame dialogue I've ever seen on television. The dialogue between villians and heroes, is just awful most of the time. It almost feels like that's how people would talk if they were making fun of action movies. It's just so forced and corny. 

6. I understand Vegeta's character, and I like it a lot, but they go way to far in showing his pride. We get it. The "I'm the Prince of all Saiyins and I'm going to kill you haha" is so repeated that it just gets downright stupid. It would have been better if it was more subtle and less in your face. I think he character is much better in the Buu Saga.

7. Piccolo being stronger than a Super Saiyin Vegeta pissed me off. He's a Namekian for crying out loud. 

8. The Z fighters again succumbing to 'Solar Flare'. How do you not close your eyes, it's pretty obvious when he's about to do it, but somehow it gets everyone for the second time.

9. The closing theme song is one of the most painful songs I have ever heard in a long time

10. I am pretty sure I heard Yamcha say "Fuck me" when Goku gave Cell a sensu bean. That was pretty awesome.
If you couldn't tell, I watched the Android/Cell saga.  




 What about English sub? I can live without the dub. Rather watch it earlier with sub 




 Really? Are you sure, because I don't if that's the case. I couldn't find a video of someone doing it.

 America is getting worse. Anti religious sentiment is growing daily. One day they will prosecute us, in the name of 'morality'. 

Think they will stay silent about our 'barbaric tradition' of circumcision? Think they will let use keep our shuls tax-free? Think non-Jews will be happy to let us keep taking time off for Jewish holidays? Science and evolution? Homosexuals? Judaism is the antithesis of where this country is headed. It won't happen suddenly, but over time you will see.  




 I don't.

Would you 'handle' a monkey shouting at you? No. You would ignore it. What's the point of telling a monkey to stop shouting? It won't stop unless it wants to, and it won't listen to you.

 Lol I thought this was /r/tennis for a second. Was very confused on how you played tennis in your basement. 




 100 years from now we won't be worrying about climate change. We will have figured out how to use something other than fossil fuels by then. Climate change is a long term hypothetical issue. 




 Well that makes sense if you spend 20 years on death row - and that's kind of the problem. Takes away from the deterrence if you know you get 20 years and you might never be executed. Either be able to do it in a year - or don't do it at all.

And since we would likely end up killing innocent people, I would say 1 year is a bad idea. 

So basically, get rid of it. 




 So don't take my pregnant wife and baby there? 




 Makes those hippies take their damn shots. Yes yes yes. 




 I think part of the death penalty not deterring crime, is that you spend 20 years in trial before you ever get executed. If people got executed within 1 year of their crime, I think things would be a lot different. So in that case, the experiment wasn't done. Then again, we would probably end up killing innocent people, so I'm not sure that would be any better. 




 It's more expensive to execute them than to feed and house them for 50 years? That seems quite odd.

 Isn't Android Studio = Intellij? 




 That's awesome. May this be encouragement to others (and myself)! 




 Ok thanks, I had a feeling that was true 




 Someone else made that same point - kind of valid, although this would just be another example of getting tax breaks for having children. That is something we do in this country. So if you don't have kids, you don't get the same luxury of being able to get some of your property tax money back. 




 [Robinhood sells IPOs as soon as 'they are available to the public'](https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/204329909-How-does-Robinhood-handle-IPOs-)

I also read [This guy seemed to only be able to buy Shake Shack at $50, 100% higher than the open price](https://medium.com/@welovejeff/my-first-two-months-trading-stocks-with-robinhood-9580af92532c)

It seems the stock will be available, but it might be too late.  




 I always seem to miss all the good IPOs. I read today that Ebay and Paypal are splitting up, and Paypal will be a newly listed company on July 20th. I read that [here](https://www.internetretailer.com/2015/06/29/ebaypaypal-divorce-date-set)

So I only use Robinhood to do my trading. Are there limits around IPOs? Will I even be able to purchase stock in the first hour? I've read that sometimes you have to go through brokers to get stock initially. 

Has anyone had an experience getting in on an IPO using Robinhood.

**Note: I am not asking if my stock pick is good or bad, so no posting with "That's a terrible idea..."** 




  what's to stop the people who don't have kids from saying they shouldn't have to pay for public schools too?

Good point! Only good point I've heard so far in agreement with the ruling. 

I guess the point also is if you have kids you *have* to have a larger house, hence higher property taxes. Also, we have many cases where we give tax benefits for having children, so this could be another benefit. 




  Religious institutions are welcome to proselytize but not on my dime

It's not on your dime actually. By not sending their children to public schools, they save the public school system money. For my school system for example, it's around $7,000. If you give familes $4,000 for sending their kid to public school, *you have saved $3,000*. 

The simple truth is that it's about money, and nothing else. The state/cities get more money if they refuse to have a voucher system. In terms of cost to the taxpayer, I will rank it for you.

**From highest cost to taxpayer, to lowest cost to taxpayer:**

1. Child goes to public school (est. cost = $8,000)
2. Child goes to private school, with a voucher (est. cost = $0 to $6,000, depending on voucher)
3. Child goes to private school, with no voucher (cost = $0)

The best option for the taxpayer is to have kids go to private schools without vouchers. This is the sole reasoning here. Nothing else. However that is slightly negated - if vouchers were given, *more students would go to private school, thus lowering the cost to the taxpayer*.

Btw even private religious schools must uphold a certain level of secular academic studies, comparable to most public schools. 




 Kind of bullshit. You pay thousands and property tax. That tax goes to pay for public school. Then you don't even send your kid to public school - which saves the school money. Shouldn't you get back at least *some* of that money? If the cost to the school system to have a child is $8,000 per child - I think it's more than fair to give $4,000 back to the family. 

But to be honest these judges don't really care about the constitution anymore. If they want something, they rule accordingly. In this case, they want money from these parents, so the ruled it unconstitutional.

 I'm a bit confused on the purpose of XAMPP for better PHP development. Currently, what I do to test my PHP locally is use this command:

    php -S localhost:8888

In the same folder that has my index.php file. I then use the browser and go to 'localhost', and it seems to work fine, my page shows up.

So how would using XAMPP be any better/different? I guess I'm not clear on how I'm supposed to be using it in the first place.

my second questions is about http://www.w3fools.com/. I saw on a wiki here that w3schools is a bad resource. I've never heard that before. Was w3fools made a long time ago? Does it still apply? 




 The only thing worse than a Republican is a DINO 









 Umm, and? Newspapers are for-profit entities. There is an owner, or share of owners that the profit goes to. Religious institutions don't have the concept of profit. In most cases, churches/syngagogues actually are in debt, and can't always make ends meet. I know most synagogues around me have large mortgages, and all their donations simply goes to cover the costs of running. 

I'm not sure how in anyway way that compares to a for-profit organization. 




 A church does not profit. So what exactly would you tax?

 I will. I don't like Ford. It's a lease that is up in 6 months. Thankfully Ford will take care of this in the morning.

 No I'm saying the car is actually in park. The computer thinks it's in neutral. It simply doesn't start. Anyway I called Ford and they said the whole computer needs to be reset, so I had it towed to the dealer. I even tried unplugging the battery for 20 minutes to see if it would reset the computer, but it didn't 




 My Ford focus 2013 won't start. It thinks my car is in neutral. Any help?

EDIT: More info - To clarify, the car is in park - but the computer thinks the car is in Neutral.

This happened while I was driving. I was driving, and then all of a sudden the traction control light went on, and I couldn't accelerate. Hitting the gas pedal would rev the car, but it wouldn't move. I turned off the car, and tried to turn it back on, and it wouldn't turn on. No clicking or anything. Seems like an electronic problem, and Ford will fix it in the morning (it's a lease) 




 I bet they were just drunk and rude, and the fact that they were holding hands was completely irrelevant. 




 If this was Wednesday around the fireworks time, I was probably right next to you
