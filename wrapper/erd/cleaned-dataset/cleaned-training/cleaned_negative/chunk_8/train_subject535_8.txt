 Does patenting GMO organisms necessarily restrict free exchange of traits obtained through selective breeding?
  
Plant varieties derived from conventional selective breeding actually can be protected by the [Plant Variety Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_Variety_Protection_Act_of_1970) which offers similar protections that patents do.  




 Dr. Perlak I first want to thank you for doing this AMA as I believe a lot of the concerns/fears of GMO is one rooted in a lack of dialogue between the public and the scientist behind this technology.
  
My first question is back in 1999 there was [this](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB919722577962514000) article in the WSJ about how Monsanto has a buddy system in which they pair up a scientist with someone from marketing/finance. Amsuingly you are mentioned in the 1999 WSJ article. My question is, does the buddy system still exist at Monsanto, and what is/was your opinion on the system?
  
Second question/s are on behalf of /u/MennoniteDan who unfortunely can't post himself due to doing some actual farm work.
  
A)Can you explain the process of discovery, and implementation, of the genetics behind the new Xtend series soybeans?"

B)"What changes in formulation has Monsanto (and BASF) made to the dicamba in Roundup Xtend, in order to lessen the chance of volatilization? I farm near crops that are very sensitive to dicamba (cucumbers, peppers, peas, tobacco and ginseng) ."
  
Edit: One last question.
  
Do you think that the current regulatory environment and public opinion on genetic engineering has negatively impacted research into genetically engineered crops? And if so what do you believe would be a good way to address this issue?
 




 Their genetically modified food is apparently causing most of the human cancers found
  
There is no strong evidence linking GMOs to cancer. 




 The real joke is that all the comments in that thread and the actual AMA are scripted paid Monsanto super secret employees. It's shills all the way down!  




 Cool, thanks for the insight.  




 Does anyone have a run down on what parts are plastic and what parts are metal? And what is the final weight of this controller?

[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.  


[Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)
  

  
  
[And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)
 
The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

[Why are you lying?](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/10/18/163034053/top-five-myths-of-genetically-modified-seeds-busted) Sterile seeds have never been brought to market and all GMO crops will produce viable offspring.  




 No it didn't.

They don't, this is a myth. 




 FDA has never approved a raw plant as a drug. Meth is a single purified chemical, even cocaine is not used as its raw plant form but just the desired purified chemical. 
  
The idea that eating an edible or smoking a blunt will ever be an FDA approved medication is absurd and I'm comfortable putting money on it that we will never see it happen. 
  
 




 Even if marijuana was not a schedule I drug the FDA would still not touch it in it's raw form let alone made into an "edible" with a 10ft pole. 
  
  Legal medical marijuana will more closely look like [Sativex](http://www.gwpharm.com/uploads/sativex_banner.jpg) then nearly anything commonly seen at a local dispensary.  




 the most noticeable difference between a lower model 7 series and an upper model 5 series is size.
  
That's not really a fair comparison, you should look at similarly optioned cars. In the case of base models the 5 series is only 50k vs the 7 series 74k.
  
Most luxury cars that IIHS are in the 45-52k range with the sole exception being the new Maserati. 
  
IIHS have said they do not plan to test the Model S at all. wonder why.
  
Probably because the car is too expensive and has too low of sale numbers to justify it, if Tesla wanted to they can pay for a test of the car themselves.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 Just to clarify IARC's findings are not a risk assessment, they didn't look at the actual risk of getting cancer from 2,4-D exposure. Their classification and findings are based off if they believe it can from the available evidence.

 I totally agree. Saying plague isn't life threatening is like saying a bullet wound isn't life threatening.  




 [Here you go](http://i.imgur.com/PZyKJVE.png), of note for some of the graphs I couldn't locate all the rounds for Gears1 as they probably overlapped with other shots.
  
  
The only range that Gears Beta showed statistical significance was at far range. I still think sample size is too small to make any large conclusion though. 
  
Also my math was quickly done so double check it if you want.
  
Edit: How positive are you that each map holds the same dimensions? For if the map is a slightly bit smaller or larger that could have a drastic effect on spread.  




 I'd say 40% more GPU power is more then slightly.  




 At least I won't die from ass cancer or heart failure.

  
Meat is a risk factor, it's not necessarily a cause. You can still get ass cancer or have heart failure if you don't eat meat.  




 The issue wasn't the type of rat used, it was that the sample size was far too small for the duration ran. Testing for carciongencity with this type of rat requires 50+ rodents per group/sex, Seralini decided on using only 10 per group/sex.  




 You need more shots per group and actually measure the distance from the center each pellet lies. That way you can do the calculations and see if the spread difference between the games is statistically significant.

 At that point the fast majority of things wouldn't be life threatening.

The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment which conducted a risk assessment on behalf of the EU found glyphosate to be non-carcinogenic and they recently made a statement in [response to the IARCs finding.](http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/349/does-glyphosate-cause-cancer.pdf)
  
The new IARC classification for glyphosate as a carcinogenic substance is based firstly on
limited evidence in humans. This risk is derived from three epidemiological studies in the
USA, Canada and Sweden based on a statistical correlation between exposure to glyphosate
and an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, this assessment was not confirmed
in a very large cohort of the also cited "Agricultural Health Study" or in other studies. A
recent publication from 2012 has reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether
exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans and the relevant
methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. The review found non-consistent
patterns of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer or any
site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate. The current report of BfR to the EU based
on the evaluation of over 30 epidemiological studies came to the overall assessment that
there is no validated or significant relationship between exposure to glyphosate and an increased
risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or other types of cancer.
