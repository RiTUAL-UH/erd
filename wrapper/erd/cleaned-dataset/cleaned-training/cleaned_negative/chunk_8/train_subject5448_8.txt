 Absolutely LOVE her! 




 I love her. I've always loved her. I still don't understand everyone's hate towards her.. 




 Hello Lavern  




 There was a kid who was called "The Phantom Pooper" he used to randomly poop in the halls around the school ALL THE TIME. Never found who that sneaky bastard was.  




 Haha yeah Bobs great! Living his life out of the limelight  




 I don't think I'm entitled to say exactly what went down, but yeah it was never the same after he left.  




 Fun fact: My dads best friends with their ex drummer bob. Used to go over to his house and play halo 3.  




 Is there a mental illness for being too poor? I think I have it.  




 This is the type of shit I love seeing
