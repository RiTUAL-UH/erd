 My first memory. Seeing grown-ups, grannies, moms and dads standing around crying. Coming to our house to watch our TV and worse, my dad crying in his room, walking in on him. 

Something really really bad happened that day that changed things for the worse for everyone.  




 I love seeing pictures of common, everyday elements in artifact collections. Much better picture of most peoples lives at that time and place.

 I was thinking a young Bull Shark. The description of the one attack in which it jumped out of the water to grab the victims arm seems too aggressive to be most other shallow water sharks. 

Did you hear about the Bull Shark that killed the man in his Florida Canal?

 Or is there a connection between dreams and reality that we cannot yet adequately explain?

I collect prophetic dreams from various places online. Here is one of them that I am sure relates to the Japanese quake and tsunami of March '11.

 7-30-90 A friend of mine was told in meditation to expect 400,000 casualties in the future. I meditated on it to pinpoint the event.

 Meditation: I called Babaji to confirm or deny the previous vision of my friend.

 A. He said, "We will use this as a testimony to the future."

 I saw many, many oriental faces. All of them were running from the right toward the left. They were all saying, "You are right, you are right, you are right"

 I saw some kind of game going on. The voice said, "I haven't done this in quite awhile. Slow down, slow down."

 I saw a three dimensional map. The voice said, "There will be a radioactive factor of 80%".

 I saw a circus in the foreground and great destruction in the background and it came to me that this referred to the 'Olympics'.

 NOTE: 1998 is the first Olympics to be held in Japan.

 NOTE: 1998, THE Olympics were held and there was a SMALL earthquake. Nothing of any consequence occurred there.

 by Dee

 http://www.greatdreams.com/disaster-dreams.htm

---------------------

The interesting thing is that the Japanese had to convince the Olympic Committee that the Fukushima radiation was not a danger in order to be chosen for the next Olympics 'against a backdrop of total destruction'. 

About the "I haven't done this in a while." The areas flooded in 2011 closely matched those of a tsunami that hit Sendai in 869.

People running 'right to left' would be from the ocean, inland (to escape the tsunami).

So I find prophetic dreams/visions to be very interesting. Maybe complete coincidence, but maybe something else. Either way they fascinate me. 




 Well thank you!  




 Guess what? I spent a couple of years studying the links. What countries suffer this, what countries do not, what are the links and similarities and dissimilarities. 

 I didn't do it for you- or to write a thesis, I did it for my own curiosity without intentions of even discussing it. 

Now. I have spent enough time handing you my thoughts on this.

Take it or leave it. Looks like you are already seeing through a biased lens so I well know I am completely wasting my time.

 I have studied this intensively. There are several countries where school/mass shootings have never happened. Some of those countries allow guns. 

Here is one thing that I have dug up that all US school shootings have in common: The shooters are all on prescribed psychiatric drugs. Every one of them. And I found this:

http://www.cchr.org/sites/default/files/International_Warnings_on_Psychiatric_Drugs_Suicide_Homicide.pdf

Those drugs are banned or highly restricted in those aforementioned countries. Our Columbine shooters were on a total of three of them. Klebold was on Paxil and Zoloft, both. and 

Harris became obsessed with homicidal and suicidal thoughts within weeks after he began taking Zoloft, according to Dr. Tracy.  Due to his obsession with killing, Harris was switched to Luvox, which was in his system at the time of the shooting, according to his autopsy. However, the change from Zoloft to Luvox is like switching from Pepsi to Coke, Dr. Tracy said.

 [Markleeville](http://www.ebbettspassadventures.com/places/markleeville.html) - Ebbetts Pass. My favorite stomping grounds. Feeling bad here. 









 They are protesting having their water and electricity shut off for periods of the day as well as lack of basic medical care. In a lot of the poorer regions the water has been privatized and they have to pay for cold water instead of it being covered (as previous) by taxes.

Like one man said- they were trying to get help for a firefighter and the hospital couldn't give them cold water- they had to go buy it to cool him off. 

This is one of my serious pet peeves- the privatization of anything that can impact human health and welfare. Because the people profiting don't give a fuck if you die in the street- profit margin trumps life every time. 




 Wow. This is horrifying.

 The fact that were seeing multiple toxins at the same time, were seeing high levels of domoic acid, and were seeing a coastwide bloom  those are indications that this is unprecedented, Trainer said.
 
 Scientists suspect this years unseasonably high temperatures are playing a role, along with the blob  a vast pool of unusually warm water that blossomed in the northeastern Pacific late last year. 
 
 This is new territory for us, Ayres said. Weve never had to close essentially half our coast.

  The French Resistance undertook nearly 1,000 acts of sabotage in the hours after the Normandy invasion began, and the damage they inflicted on railroads and other communications played a crucial role in preventing German reinforcements from arriving quickly in Northern France. 
 
 And every time a German troop train was sabotaged, a nearby French village was likely to suffer horrendous retaliation -- like the town of Tulle, where a hundred men where seized at random and massacred three days after the Normandy invasion, or the village of Oradour-sur-Glane, where 642 citizens, including 205 children, were killed the day after that. The men were shot; the women and children were burned to death in a church.
 
 "We were depending on considerable assistance from the insurrectionists in France," Eisenhower remembered. "Throughout France the Free French had been of inestimable value in the campaign. ... Without their great assistance the liberation of France and the defeat of the enemy in Western Europe would have consumed a much longer time and meant greater losses to ourselves."

 My great grandmothers big victorian house was built by her father on several acres in 1920. My great grandmother lived in that house until the 1980's when she passed away.

Sometime in the late 1940's she had a medical issue that made it hard for her to climb stairs, so her husband built this little, one bedroom cottage with a bay window and all of the amenities a ways back on the property where she could recuperate. He built that rose trellis, planted the climbing roses and planted a garden around it (unfortunately is not visible in the pictures)

After grans recuperation the 'little house' was used for everything from family members needing a resting place from troubles to honeymoon quarters.

Sorry about the potato quality pics. 
 









 Not sure if you are familiar with 2010 heat wave, or the 2009:

By the time the heatwaves had ended in late October 2010, about $500 billion (2011 USD) of damage was done, in the Northern Hemisphere alone. The heat waves had caused around 17,905,000 deaths globally, with 3,000+ direct, 17,821,672+ indirect, and 21+ unconfirmed deaths

Russia: On July 30, wildfires killed 25 people, leaving more than 2000 people homeless. The fires were still burning on 1 August.

Likely in part due to the heat wave and smoke from forest fires, Moscow recorded 14,340 total deaths in the month of July, 4,824 more than the number recorded in July 2009. Pollution levels in the city were five times higher than normal.

 A lot of people think differently, but it takes a brave soul to express it. 




 This is the problem with mass poverty. When people are poor they cannot escape climate or geophysical catastrophes. If they don't work that day- their families don't eat that day.  




  Debate isn't the definition of freedom of speech, your right to say, think, write, and create whatever you want is your freedom of speech, and it should never be limited.

Your free speech is limited every day. You cannot, for example, speak in a way that threatens the life of another or incites rioting or panic.

Another way it is limited is by peer pressure - this is an internal limitation created by our instinct to 'go along with the group'. This is a safety instinct that all people have to a greater or lesser degree. People who internalize a lot of fear or self-doubt are more willing to 'go along', even despite their real feelings. 

See: Lord of the Flies. 
 




  ppl you never imagined as racists will start flying it at their houses just to make a point.

Best answer to that? Make fun of their ignorant asses to the point where the only 'point' is how stupid they are:

As John Oliver said: 

The confederate flag is one of those symbols that should really only be seen on t-shirts, belt buckles and bumper stickers to help the rest of us identify the worst people in the world.  




 This is because you have a population that is suffering, financially and under a great deal of stress. People are angry.

Then you have groups who are subtly misdirecting the source of the pain and anger toward those people they can lash out at - easy targets because of their skin color or sexual preference. Much easier to get mad at those gays or blacks than to try to go after a multinational banking system.

Then you have some marketing genius that came up with the term 'SJW' which is used in a derogatory manner to black-label people. A lot of redditors are cowed by that. 

I saw someone make a genius post about racism that was nearly on the level of a Martin Luther King. His post was highly accepted but then suddenly he was shouted down and bum-rushed the moment he was called an 'SJW'. 

Many Redditors, for all their proclamations of 'FREE SPEECH' are more groupthink creatures than they would ever admit. 




 I just posted this to someone else - but here goes

 StormFront is the opposite of free speech. There are no arguments against racism allowed on StormFront. Just try it and see how fast your free speech is banned there.

 Open forums where people can argue pro and con is free speech, which is why Reddit, even though it has some putrid subs, is not banned in Germany, Italy or France.

 




 StormFront is the opposite of free speech. There are no arguments against racism allowed on StormFront. Just try it and see how fast your free speech is stifled there.

  And do you remember the reactions of the citizenships that had 'no idea' about the terrible things being done?

It's like a german told me in the late 1960's when I questioned him about this.

He said that the attacks on the jews started with flyers - papering - being delivered that said negative things. Then eventually it reached the radio and newspapers. So everyone everyday was reading bad things about the jews and beginning to believe it.

In his neighborhood - there were 3 people on his block repeating these things, then 10, then eventually the majority, repeating them so often that even the most open minded began to believe or at least pretend to believe so as to not come under pressure.

And that every german adult with 'half a brain' knew exactly what was happening. They had just been 'primed' to not care and turn away.  




 Re-read my post. I didn't say that at all. 
I said that Sites (such as [StormFront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_\(website\))) are banned in countries in which negative PR against certain races was propagated to the point that a world war and genocide resulted. 

I can't criticize their choice to do so seeing the historical result that they experienced.

Reddit is not banned because on reddit there are many people of many creeds who go to racist subs and provide alternate viewpoints. Sites such as StormFront forums are a solid wall of hatred with no alternative viewpoint allowed. 

See the difference? 




 Did you see this? http://www.discogs.com/artist/2337287-Jim-Salvati 




 I was looking at some of your old newspapers of that era and they are so focused on this subject (anti-alcohol) that the stories and cartoons are almost Onion-like in their fervor. 




 The story of how Burnett's Mound protected Topeka from Tornados until they dug out the side of it for a water tank.

 It was always told by Chief Burnett that the mound must not be disturbed because it was a sacred place watched over by the Great Spirit and those who have past on must always be respected. The people of Kansas believed that by respecting the Chief's wishes that the mound would protect the city of Topeka from the devastating power of tornadoes.
 
 In 1960, Chief Burnett's mound was disturbed with construction at its base for an interstate bypass. Upon Burnett's Mound itself, it was cut into at the top of its north side, perfectly visual for all Topekans to view as its desecration continued to fit a 5 million gallon steel drum reservoir water tank. In the following years, building began to slowly progress around Burnett's Mound. 
 
 At 6:55PM on June 8, 1966, a tornado of immense power struck the city of Topeka, destroying all within its path. It lasted 34 minutes ending at 7:29PM. The F5 tornado was a half mile wide, as about 820 homes were destroyed and 3,000 damaged. Entire blocks were leveled to splinters in seconds. The tornado's violent winds had estimated at around 300 mph. 
 
 Total cost was put at $100,000,000.00 making it at the time the costliest tornado in American history. Even to this day, with inflation factored in, the Topeka tornado still stands as one of the costliest on record. The tornado claimed 16 lives, injured over 500 people, and left over 3500 homeless. 




 I'll just drop this on ya: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 




 There is no debate in Germany, Italy or France. They have had experience with this that lead to a World War and the genocide of millions. Hate sites are banned in those countries. I can't judge them for that, knowing their history.

I can't say for sure that Roof would have become racist from encountering racism in other ways, maybe meeting someone and being invited to a KKK meeting, for instance. I can just go by what he wrote of his personal experience in his death manifesto.  




 Roof said explicitly in his manifesto (that was released a couple of days ago) that he was not raised racist and he 'woke up' after discovering a white supremacist website online. 

So basically he would not have found the sanction and encouragement to be as racist as he became - racist enough to go on a shooting spree. 

What the hell can I say? It's a fucking shame, but it's a fact.  



















 Yea.. that damn horse is long gone. 




 Excellent response. I am so sick of hearing right wing commentators newscasters and politicians jumping through flaming hoops and tiptoeing over beds of nails to avoid mentioning 'race' in this incidence. 




 Identify and fix problems? The day it happened I posted about the problem of 24/7 racist sites - including subs on reddit- and how they can impact the weak minded. I got d/v to hell. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3a9ec9/charleston_church_shootingmanhunt_megathread/csbhgmt

When I was young I listened to Germans who escaped Germany talking to my great grandmother on a regular basis. I know what the effect of 'papering' (as they called the dissemination of racial tracts) can do to drive race-hate. People can deny it all they want but they need to face up to it. 

Once an belief has *sanction of approval* by seemingly large numbers of people or government action the believers tend to multiply like cockroaches and start acting out. The Confederate Flag on government land is one type of sanction of approval.  




 Everyone's just rushing to shut that fucking barn door, aren't they? 




 For a sec I thought the mom was on the right.  




 You would have to ask the red pill guys about that.

 Much better. I would widen the moons to match the width of the font lines. Perhaps even join them top and bottom in a sort of overlap. Also, work with each letter separately to make sure your [kerning](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kerning) is correct. It's somewhat off. 

Also shadowing- it can be a serious issue when you go to have any printing done. Ok for website work but not print. 

That being said, you might want to rethink the colors of the moons. 

A couple things to do while working: 

In between changes, take 5-6 steps back from the work and look at it from a distance. Also, take it down to 100px at it's widest and make sure it is still readable. 

GL- much better! 




 Very difficult to read. Dump the shading for solid blocks of color. Some letters fat others skinny and pointed. Way too much 'busy-ness with the moon overlays'. 

Remember- a logo is not supposed to be a work of art. A logo is an *impression hit*. Bam. Your viewer needs to be able to absorb it, mentally interpret it (and remember it) in a split second. 

Anytime a viewer has to spend even a whole second or two trying to interpret the impression, you lose. I had to 'work' on this one to read it. 

Needs a do-over. 




 I was trying to reply to the original commenter and missed the mark there. Yes we are.  




 Looks like my current desktop. A picture that I took in Antelope Canyon. How is the lake, btw? 




 I come from a long line of progressives and we had volunteers in every war up to and including Vietnam (although I think that that person only went because of the people we had in ww1 and ww2 and a belief that we were protecting the country as we had back then). We also had people a generation back march with blacks in Selma and my aunt used to take me to anti-war protests at the university. 

We also have a few gun owners in the family who keep them for safety. 

Watch the broad strokes there is all I am saying.  




 He went to the police and asked them to arrest him just before the events. They wouldn't because "he hadn't committed a crime." 

He had beat his wife twice. But back then in Texas it was not a crime to beat your wife.

edit: a letter. 




 I would never put red in an eye image- especially a cross-hair. 




 I always design for new (or lesser known) companies an iconic and text 'blended' logo that can be combined or stand alone as an icon or as text. 




 Exactly what I came in to say- trees gotta go. Change up the text a bit - you nailed it SolaVirtus. 




 I pointed this out- linked to /r/coontown - and people got huffy as hell with me for pointing out that some parts of the internet have provided a great deal of encouragement for guys like the shooter.

 For once, Disney designers screwed the pooch with this one. Even if we aren't calling it a 'logo' the design is bad. Hard to believe that they did this. The silhouettes are poorly placed   sized and combined with all of the little stars it looks very messy and distracting.

 I am very sorry to hear about your mother. I think it may help you to read this essay on a mans journey through his wifes cancer.

[Here.](http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a34905/matthew-teague-wife-cancer-essay/)

I decided years ago that if I had invasive cancer I would opt for palliative care only, following what our family doctor of many years did. Most doctors avoid aggressive treatment under these circumstances. This was only recently affirmed for me after reading the essay I linked above.

What I am saying here is that perhaps your mother felt this way also. And she took her own way out, not yours. 

All I know of Reiki is that there are some practitioners who work with a University medical center/hospice near me. I very much doubt that they reject standard medicine. 

I had a friend who was diagnosed with HIV in 1985. He was a Peruvian, but had been living in Utah for decades. He rejected "western medicine" and went with alternative therapies, marijuana, diet modifications, etc. This had nothing to do with 'religion', it was just his choice.

We went hiking and mountain climbing in 1999 and he looked and performed like an athlete. He wore me out.

In 2000 he went to the hospital for minor emergency surgery to remove his appendix. Surgery went great. He died a day later from an accidental overdose of morphine from the wrong setting on the self injection machine. 

It would have been easy for us to rage at standard medicine, but none of his loved ones chose to do so. 

I hope that if I get cancer that my children will be accepting of the choice I make and do not hold the people who assist me in that choice accountable for my death. 

And I truly hope you are able to release your anger and find some peace.

Watch it again. The car didn't move until rambo jumped out of his cop car and started shooting into it point blank. *Then* they tried to back away. 




 You be really careful out there. Stay hydrated and make sure you can wet yourself down.  




 Some cities [pay millions in lawsuits every year](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/14/charlotte-north-carolina-police-jonathan-ferrell-black-man) brought by bad actions by cops. 

If that money were coming out of the FOP Retirement funds instead of taxpayer pockets, this shit would stop yesterday. 




 They weren't being 'disobedient' to this cop. Their car was parked and not moving beside the other cop car. Until he jumped out of his car and immediately fired on them. 




 They were sitting there, parked beside the other cop car, until the shooter (cop) pulled up, jumped out of his car and started shooting at them point blank. *Then* they tried to back out. 




 I was just looking (and found his dad) but a lot of people drown on the Connecticut River. Something about how the water channels run that creates a suction kind of current. I am a great swimmer and would never go in that river without a life preserver after what I just read.
 




 He probably has the market for this sewn up. I noticed a few decades ago that there aren't many conservatives generating art, music, etc. As a general rule they don't seem to be very capable in these arenas.

 Part of the problem is going to be that Kim Jon Un has offended China, once their greatest supporter and goods supplier.

 Did you actually think I was 'slandering' the internet? I have been on the net since 1997. What I meant - and I shouldn't have to spell this out- was that with the proliferation of racist sites in the dark corners that people like this kid can get all the support he needs on his way to some hellish act or another.  









 Oh I see, I should never post blatantly racist subs on reddit to redditors. Is that the message? Or I should have posted something like [StormFront.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_(website) because it is off-reddit? 

Or are you saying that this isn't relevant? [Racist Internet Forums Linked to U.S. Hate Crimes](http://time.com/67840/racist-internet-forums-linked-to-u-s-hate-crimes/)

Because it is going on 24/7 on the internet and it is having an impact on weak minded individuals.

edit: and it's a week later and my remarks on the influence of online racism/white supremacy groups is absolutely correct.. you know.. the observations I made on this post that got down voted to hell by non-thinking, knee jerk redditors? gj there.

From his manifesto:

I was not raised in a racist home or environment......The event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case. I kept hearing and seeing his name, and eventually I decided to look him up. I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was. It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right. But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words black on White crime into Google, and I have never been the same since that day. The first website I came to was the Council of Conservative Citizens. 

There were pages upon pages of these brutal black on White murders. I was in disbelief. At this moment I realized that something was very wrong. How could the news be blowing up the Trayvon Martin case while hundreds of these black on White murders got ignored? 

From this point I researched deeper and found out what was happening in Europe. I saw that the same things were happening in England and France, and in all the other Western European countries. Again I found myself in disbelief.

 This is really a climate change joke in disguise. 




 I have just watched a couple of these and they were so cringe-worthy I could barely stand it.

One that sticks out was this harridan owner who was just horrible to her help and her husband. They had this menu that was just jam packed with all of these different meals that the chef could not cook and they could not keep up with in the kitchen. 

I would be interested in knowing if that one was still open or not, if anyone can recall it. 




 Thank you! Very cool. 




 With this [kind of 16th century ignorant bullshit](http://www.reddit.com/r/CoonTown/) going on 24/7 on the internets he probably thought he would be hailed as a hero, coast to coast.

edit:  It's almost a week later and it turns out that Roof wasn't raised racist, he adopted hard core racism from white nationalist websites   forums.  Exactly what I was pointing out in this post. Fuckers. 




 You mean like the guy shot in the back? 




 It amazes me that they aren't starting any desal operations on the west coast.

If return of salt is a problem, melt in the arctic is adding too much fresh water- I am sure barges can take salt north and slowly add it. Possibly as part of cargo operations of some kind or other. 









 And North Korea is going through a horrible drought. The massive rainfalls vs. horrendous droughts is so striking. 



















 Thank you very much. I appreciate your kind words.

 Then you could say that the drive for polio vaccines was 'a religion' or the belief in bacteria and viruses and drive to get people to use sanitation was 'a religion' - or any of the other scientific breakthroughs that improved the health and well being of mankind. 

The only controversy here is that there was not a multi-trillion dollar corporate body fighting against those things because they would impact their profit margin.

 The nations were angry, and your wrath has come.

 I don't ask black conservatives anything. I don't talk to people who support the KKK.

Bill Clinton:

**Longest economic expansion in American history**

The President's strategy of fiscal discipline, open foreign markets and investments in the American people helped create the conditions for a record 115 months of economic expansion. Our economy has grown at an average of 4 percent per year since 1993.

**More than 22 million new jobs**

More than 22 million jobs were created in less than eight years -- the most ever under a single administration, and more than were created in the previous twelve years.

**Highest homeownership in American history**

A strong economy and fiscal discipline kept interest rates low, making it possible for more families to buy homes. The homeownership rate increased from 64.2 percent in 1992 to 67. 7 percent, the highest rate ever.

**Lowest unemployment in 30 years**

Unemployment dropped from more than 7 percent in 1993 to just 4.0 percent in November 2000. Unemployment for African Americans and Hispanics fell to the lowest rates on record, and the rate for women is the lowest in more than 40 years.

**Raised education standards, increased school choice, and doubled education and training investment**

Since 1992, reading and math scores have increased for 4th, 8th, and 12th graders, math SAT scores are at a 30-year high, the number of charter schools has grown from 1 to more than 2,000, forty-nine states have put in place standards in core subjects and federal investment in education and training has doubled.

**Largest expansion of college opportunity since the GI Bill**

President Clinton and Vice President Gore have nearly doubled financial aid for students by increasing Pell Grants to the largest award ever, expanding Federal Work-Study to allow 1 million students to work their way through college, and by creating new tax credits and scholarships such as Lifetime Learning tax credits and the HOPE scholarship. At the same time, taxpayers have saved $18 billion due to the decline in student loan defaults, increased collections and savings from the direct student loan program.

**Family and Medical Leave Act for 20 million Americans**

To help parents succeed at work and at home, President Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993. Over 20 million Americans have taken unpaid leave to care for a newborn child or sick family member.

**Smallest welfare rolls in 32 years**

The President pledged to end welfare as we know it and signed landmark bipartisan welfare reform legislation in 1996. Since then, caseloads have been cut in half, to the lowest level since 1968, and millions of parents have joined the workforce. People on welfare today are five times more likely to be working than in 1992.

**Higher incomes at all levels**

After falling by nearly $2,000 between 1988 and 1992, the median family's income rose by $6,338, after adjusting for inflation, since 1993. African American family income increased even more, rising by nearly $7,000 since 1993. After years of stagnant income growth among average and lower income families, all income brackets experienced double-digit growth since 1993. The bottom 20 percent saw the largest income growth at 16.3 percent. 




 Signs? No idea. In Panama City Beach (for instance) they have flagpoles up and down the beaches - Green flag for ok, Yellow for caution and Red means "do not get in the water", either rip tide, jellyfish outbreak or sharks spotted. 

They also go up and down the beach with 4 wheelers and megaphones and tell everyone to get out of the water. 

I am just stunned that they *left the beach open after an attack.*  




 Been a year and a half. I think of my husband every single day and probably cry once a week, still. I am still shocked sometimes that he is not here.  




 Fact. 




 And the white conservative motherfuckers hated him for it too. 




 The main issue is the dying middle class. People working two jobs just to get by don't have time or energy for leisure activities like fish keeping, nor the funds.  




 Both of them belong on /r/punchablefaces - right up there with Joffrey. 




 And that is the real entitlement group. 




 I tried to sell it to Mexico for a nickel. They wouldn't take it. 




 A lot comes down to them from the Sierra Snowpack- which we haven't had much of the past two years. 




 I wish our police in the US were like you guys, honestly, you are the best. 




 Borage is beautiful. It always reminded me of purple, fuzzy shooting star (dodecathion). They look adorable planted in clumps with each other in a cottagescape. 




 Absolutely nothing that can impact human lives, health and freedom- from prisons to hospitals to utilities (like your water supply) should ever, ever depend on a profit motive. 

 Some people will sell their mothers for profit- *your health or freedom means absolutely nothing to them.* 




 This is kind of dependent on where you are. The farther north you go the wetter it is. Or used to be. 




 All day? Used to take weeks to get those. 




 I listened to a speech (was interpreted by a friend) of an Indian Sociologist that counsels business. And most of what I got out of it was that they were outbreeding the rest of the world and had planned on beating China. 

And unfortunately, according to him, the schools are basically college mills that do not have the level of education as depicted on their diplomas. As long as you can pay for your semesters- you get a degree. 




 If I were a main stockholder of Activision/Blizzard and had dropped in to the forums anytime in the past two months- I would be making some phone calls and setting some folks hair on fire. 




 The Pitchforks are Coming .. for us Plutocrats. By plutocrat Nick Hanauer.


 Seeing where things are headed is the essence of entrepreneurship. And what do I see in our future now?
 
 I see pitchforks.
 
 But the problem isnt that we have inequality. Some inequality is intrinsic to any high-functioning capitalist economy. The problem is that inequality is at historically high levels and getting worse every day. Our country is rapidly becoming less a capitalist society and more a feudal society. Unless our policies change dramatically, the middle class will disappear, and we will be back to late 18th-century France. Before the revolution.
 
 And so I have a message for my fellow filthy rich, for all of us who live in our gated bubble worlds: Wake up, people. It wont last.
 
 If we dont do something to fix the glaring inequities in this economy, the pitchforks are going to come for us. No society can sustain this kind of rising inequality. In fact, there is no example in human history where wealth accumulated like this and the pitchforks didnt eventually come out. **You show me a highly unequal society, and I will show you a police state. Or an uprising. There are no counterexamples. None. Its not if, its when.**

 Just don't be Jorah Mormont. 




  They say they've doubled their work force for WoW. Where is it? It's sure not showing.

I have been worried that they contracted a 3rd world code sweatshop operation to save money and their 'new devs' are possibly all people who have never been able to afford to play the game. 

This would be the "HP effect" in action.
 




 Wow.. good thing they hired those 250 new 'devs'.  




 Not sure if it was the bitching (although I am sure that was a big part of it) so much as the leaving. I'll be interested in the numbers when they come out. 




 Come to think of it.. I'm not sure if I have actually seen WoD plate gear. If so, it wasn't memorable. 




 Yes, and after 10 yrs of playing solely Alliance through progressions, I got a nice statue.. of an Orc, my sworn enemy. 

Thanks Blizzard! 




 When we bought, we didnt plan on getting a place that looks like were living in an African savanna.

Whine. While Pacific islanders are losing their homes and land to rising seas, most of Bangladesh is flooding, people already in dire poverty are fleeing with what they can strap on their backs and oh my your lawn is brown. Heavens to betsy! 

Maybe these asshats should have thought about all of this back when they first heard about Climate Change and put some of that wealth to good use investing in renewables.  




 And so it begins. If they get away with segregating water for lawns according to elite status, then that will set a precedent for clean drinking water down the road. And don't doubt they will have the same attitude about it.  




 20 years ago if I had seen someone write something like that I would have thought they were mentally disabled. 




 This is some 3rd world bullshit right here. 




 I never turn the new art on- can't stand it. My once smooth and lithe F-NE [runs like an NFL linebacker hitting the field before the big game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgLkF4ROJ_o) instead of the [catlike forest creature](https://youtu.be/S0dgNPrcebM?t=6s) she has been for 10 yrs.

And her face..once pointed and elfin now looks square and mannish.

I don't even want to talk about the new art gnome. My once calm, tranquil 10 yr old veteran mage looks like she has a case of the perm-crazies. 

Just sickening. 




 Women take a mixture of male and female hormones in birth control every month and female-to-male trans take male hormones. It's perfectly legal with a prescription as far as I know.

What's felonious about it? Bit confused here. 




 Even the gear. My NE, Gnome and Drae are not happy wearing what looks like handmedown orc stuff that has been dragged through the mud. 




 She looks very Russian. That's how. 




 My Apache friend complimented me once for "living on Indian Time."

I think it was a compliment.

I never wear a watch. Ever.  




 Seen Ali Baba lately?

 









 I like the re-designs, barring just a few (Cadillac?) Just need to know how Microsoft, bing and Yahoo still look so .. old.

  Oak Island Mayor Betty Wallace told CNN that the female swimmer was attacked first, around 4:15 p.m. Less than 90 minutes later, as responders were still tending to her, the boy was then attacked.

They left the beach open? Florida beaches close at just the sighting of a shark- let alone an attack. What kind of insanity is this? 




 They need sued to the ground for leaving the beach open after the first attack.

 I came on here to say just this. As a child of the 60's I don't recall seeing most of these clothes from the 70's outside of some patterns and some store mannequins. 









 I told my kids to engrave that on my Urn. 




 Thank you for this small ray of sanity.
