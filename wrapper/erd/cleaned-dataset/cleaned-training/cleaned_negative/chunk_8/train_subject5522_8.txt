 The kind of revolution I want isn't just a change in leadership where we have some bloody fight and a new leader assumes his or her place at the top of the pyramid. Then we go back to the same old structure where people are basically slaves mindlessly plugging in to the machine. What interests me is the kind of revolution that happens when people wake up to the power they already have, the power that is inside of every human being, power that can't be taken away in a real sense - power that those at the top can only trick us into believing we don't have by using illusion and scare tactics. The revolution I want is one where people stop feeling scared all the time, where we feel like we have to wait around for permission from our superiors before we take action. I think this revolution is already here for many people. It will really take off when kids realize they don't have to pay a fortune to go to college for four years, that instead they can talk their way into jobs or else they can start their own careers. This revolution happens every time people take charge of their own lives, start getting in touch with their creative selves and the community around them. It'll happen when people start paying more interest to local politics than they do to the BS of Presidential politics. This revolution happens when people organize rent strikes, when they learn how to grow their own food. The truth is we don't need a Revolution. We need 300 million revolutions. 




 I would imagine there is wild variation between different subs for gender. Conspiracy seems pretty male, but then again I don't really know. 




 The Reader's Picks are always so much smarter than the NYT picks.  




 My post isn't really about Ellen Pao, it's about New York Times bias.  









 I hope someone hears this 500 years from now and thinks "God music used to be really good back then." 




 That was great. Really strong playing. 




 That's the nice thing about waking up. People who wake up never have to be bored ever again. 









 Well the shit we're in isn't something we can escape easily, but the number of mindless sheep is dwindling in my estimation. Just look at this site. A lot of trivial shit to be sure, but also a lot of increasingly radical opinions popping up in unexpected subs. There are comments sections of papers where people commenting have things figured out to a degree that the journalists writing the articles still haven't. 90% of people are basically asleep, but 10% aren't and that equates to a fuckload of people. And after all, how many do you need awake to have a revolution? Not 100% Maybe 15 to 20 % would do the trick. It's coming. You want proof? Check out the security measures the super wealthy are taking. They're scared. 




 I'm really not sure it was a failure at all. People see common ground now on issues like the NSA and civil liberties where we would have got bogged down in semantic bullshit before. We've started to look past left and right/ Fox news vs MSNBC contrived divisions. I have a lot of hope that our time is coming. The Empire is looking nervous. 




 Me and my folks were in two different states outside of New York state. One woman was in Brooklyn sharing with people. A guy in Virginia. Like I said, doors open, drawers open, nothing missing. Not NYPD in my opinion. The NYPD was present at the park but there were a lot of other weird people sniffing around. I had my photo taken more or less constantly while I was there. People kept using different ploys to get my name and biographical data/ address etc. 




 My place and my folks the same day in different cities. A couple of people I met there had it happen to them too. I found this out later, my wife was still in our place. Could be coincidence but it freaked me out a bit at the time. 




 The police did so much dirty shit, it was impossible to keep up. They went around telling drug addicts all over Manhattan that they should head to Zuccotti Park so they could get free food and clothes. The place filled up with junkies and then the media got to film it and say look at all these dirty protestors. A lot of the cops were sympathetic but then some group would show up with orders to intimidate people, driving motorcycles through groups of people on the sidewalk trying to provoke a reaction. There were a bunch of weird break ins in apartments right around that time where nothing was stolen, drawers gone through. 




 Seriously. They used the classic COINTELPRO playbook to break it up. 




 [William Sargant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sargant) 









 That mix was basically my experience of Occupy at ground level. Don't believe anything you read about it. It was incredibly diverse when I was there. Lots of Anarchists, Libertarians, old hippies, young people, families, every economic class from richest to poorest. It was really wild. 
And what happened was we got harassed out of existence by a bunch of nasty cops and infiltrators. 




 Because it is! It's also got a really good collection of  literature about the legal history of drugs. I'll be a little sad if they ever update the site. 




 For example: The DEA's Mission Statement and then the Schaeffer response to it:

**DEA's  Statement**: The mission of the Drug Enforcement Administration is to enforce the controlled substances laws and regulations of the United States and to bring to the criminal and civil justice system of the United States or any other competent jurisdiction, those organizations, and principal members of organizations, involved in the growing, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances appearing in or destined for illicit traffic in the United States; and to recommend and support nonenforcement programs aimed at reducing the availability of illicit controlled substances on the domestic and international markets.

**Schaeffer response**:
That's a nice sounding statement, but the mission of the drug enforcement authorities in the United States has never been quite that simple.  The truth is that the DEA and its predecessors were primarily the result of the most cynical political ploys, and the history of these agencies is among the dirtiest and most ridiculous chapters of American history. 

For some good examples of this, we invite you read the many Historical References, particularly Professor Whitebread's Piece, The History of the Non-Medical Use of Drug in the United States, as well as the historical portions of   The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs, and Dan Baum's excellent work on modern history, Smoke and Mirrors. 




 I just discovered this stuff. It got a lot of views before but since I'd never seen it before, I thought it might be good to re-post. Here's the trove of links if you're interested in digging: [moose archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/moosearchive/comments/1wflhm/archive/) 














 That was the committee, if I'm remembering right,  that accidentally stumbled across the forgotten trove of forgotten MKULTRA docs that John Marks used for Search for the Manchurian Candidate and Walter Bowart used for Operation Mind Control.

 It's a real comeback! 




 I am so digging the downvotes on this one.

Interesting. Bring it on. Screw Cond Nast Publications. 









 Ellen Pao might be gone, but look at the people who are still here. 









 Thank you! Great resource. 




 Thanks to people who've posted, that's helpful. My own digging has found this: [Julian Assange: "Stratfor is a Private Intelligence Enron" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4moGc_BvY0). 

I'm starting to form the opinion that they're a kind of intelligence service for hire for corporations? A kind of intelligence version of Blackwater/Xe/Academi/whatever those people are calling themselves this week.

Worryingly, Stratfor seems to do a lot of investigation of activists and activist communities. Are there others like them out there? Are they into manipulating public opinion on popular message boards? 




 And Chinese and corporations. Etc... there is a lot of BS we have to swim through to get to reality.

 I would argue that the average person's eyes were more open forty years ago. Watergate and the Church committee revelations about MKULTRA not to mention the weirdness of Jonestown made a lot of people open their eyes to the darkness around them. For all the advantages of the internet, it can be an information tsunami that buries stuff that might wake people up. I think right at this moment, the powers that be are tightening their grip on info which has the twin effect of making info harder to come by but also of making it more precious. Arguably, the average Soviet intellectual used to be better informed about the KGB because of samizdat (illicitly passed around documents and information) than Americans currently are about the goings on of the NSA, the CIA, Stratfor etc... The depth of knowledge of American students about the CIA's activities in Vietnam and globally back in the pre-internet era was little short of astonishing for its bredth and accuracy. 




 John Judge was another one of my heroes. I wish everyone on this sub could read his article [The Black Hole of Guyana](http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/JohnJudge/Jonestown.html). I'm sure you already know it. This is the article that probably sent me down the rabbit hole in the first place! Unless you count the  pictures of the massacre in Jonestown that were placed in newspapers when I was a kid. 




 More on Sharon Tate's father Paul Tate from [Miles Williams Mathis' fascinating site](http://mileswmathis.com/tate.pdf)

 Paul Tate
 All that is suggestive, but the biggest red flag in this whole charade is that Sharon's father Paul Tate was a
 colonel in army intelligence.
 
   That rank is just under general.  They don't tell us exactly in what capacity
 he served, of course, but they do admit he served for 23 years, (supposedly) ending in 1969.  So he started
 in 1946.  Interestingly, that is when army intelligence was split into various departments, including the
 CIA.  Yes, the CIA started in 1947.  

 In 1959, the Tates moved to Verona, Italy, where Paul Tate was stationed at Passalacqua, the headquarters
 for SETAF (Southern European Task Force).  This links him to 
 Operation Gladio
 .  General Maletti
 commander of Italian military intelligence at the time of the Tate murderslater testified in court that
 the CIA had been involved in many false flag operations in Italy and Europe, including murders and
 bombings, for the purpose of creating an Italian nationalism that was capable of halting what it saw as a
 slide to the left.  Sound familiar?  Maletti added, Don't forget that Nixon was in charge and Nixon was a
 strange man, a very intelligent politician but a man of rather unorthodox initiatives.  Nixon was in charge
 in 1969, but Operation Gladio had been instituted by Allen Dulles much earlier, and it was financed in
 large part by the US, through the CIA, which Dulles led under Eisenhower and Kennedy (1953 to late
 1961).  The Operation kicked into high gear in the late 50's to counter growing leftist movements,
 especially in Italy.  We must assume that is why Paul Tate was in Verona in 1959 with his family.  Paul Tate
 was not just military, he was a colonel in intelligence, which indicates he was probably involved in Gladio.
 One of these Gladio false flags was the Piazza Fontana bombing of 1969, just a few months after the
 alleged Tate murders.  The bombing was initially attributed to anarchists (violent hippies, you know), but
 it later came out in testimony like that of General Maletti that these bombings were really the work of the
 CIA, in league with other European intelligence agencies.   This indicates that Sharon Tate's own father
 was capable of organizing false flag events, and knew others who could help with whatever needed to be
 done, including faking deaths and pinning them on leftists.  You may think of the Tate murders as just
 one more Gladio false flag operation against the left.   Yes, the Manson murders were an instance of
 Gladio moving to the US. 




 We should pool together and do a superbowl ad. That could be fun.  




 We could use a Mae Brussell these days. Do you think she was killed? She was getting really deep into Michael Aquino stuff and satanic ritual abuse before she died. 




 They won't even let Graham Hancock speak, so I doubt they'll bee too keen on things that veer into MKULTRA, CHAOS, COINTELPRO etc... Who is behind Ted anyway? I'm not against them, but I would like to know more about their aims. 




 In other words, he ate his last meal with two of the victim's of the Manson family, the director of Rosemary's Baby - a movie about Satanic ritual - and another director who made the Manchurian Candidate - a movie about mind control. This was his company in the final hours of his life before he was killed, reputedly by a victim of mind control. Sharon Tate's father, incidentally, was a Colonel in Army Intelligence from 1946 to 1969. 









 It's this chart that scares me in particular: [How humans interact with one another, particularly online](https://prod01-cdn03.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/02/screenshot14.png). Notice the prominent place for the concept of magic at the top.

 What's your opinion of this theory Dave McGowan wrote about in Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon that the whole hippy/summer of love phenomenon was basically a synthetic creation by the CIA to subdue the antiwar movement? 




 [The story of Essiac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jojYLUwSjhI) 




 This stuff is very interesting though it draws conclusions that go beyond my own:

 The CIA had its own version of COINTELPRO, called CHAOS.  Again, this is not a conspiracy theory, it is
 now admitted by the CIA.  
 It is known that CHAOS
  was started by Johnson in 1967 and then expanded by
 Nixon in 1969.  It was directed by Richard Helms and run by the notorious James Jesus Angleton.  Nixon
 also linked COINTELPRO and CHAOS.  It went into its tightest security mode in July of 1969, the month
 before the Tate murders.   Seymour Hersh blew the whistle on CHAOS in a 1974 
 New York Times
  article.
 Since the 
 NYT
  is controlled by the CIA, we must assume this was mainly damage control: the admission of
 lesser crimes to cover larger ones.   One of the larger ones remaining hidden until now is the control of
 the Tate murders.   If Hersh really knew anything about CHAOS, he would have known of its premier
 operation, successful beyond all imagining.   But Hersh's articles never once mention the Tate murders.
 This is why I say his articles were misdirection.  They hinted at many things, but gave you nothing
 concrete.  The hints all pushed you toward smaller things, which acted as further cover for the big things
 like the Tate operation.   









 The thing I've never been able to get my head around was the fact that a felon, on parole, who was known to be harboring run away teen girls, who was accused repeatedly of everything from theft to rape, how was it the police never arrested him before the murders? He was violating so many of the terms of his parole that he could have been sent away for many years without formal charges for crimes. Ordinary people would have been arrested, but the LAPD never touched him. Cops from LA later claimed they were being held back from arresting him. By who? 









 That's astonishing. Massachusetts and Boston in particular was a real center of this stuff. I'm really starting to feel like LSD was just a giant mind hack by the CIA. 




 Thanks for that! 




 I also think they chose him specifically because he was Polish and they were interested in seeing how they could manipulate and break people with an Eastern European background using psychological techniques. 




 Do you have a link for that? 




 I definitely think McVeigh was  trained using an advanced version of MKULTRA. Unfortunately the one thing that changed over the years was the ability of these people to cover their tracks so we'll likely never know what happened with McVeigh. We do know a great deal about Kaczynski. Henry Murray conducted the experiments on him at Harvard. These experiments were designed to break young people. All of the participants were considered vulnerable because they came from working class backgrounds and were thus subjected to the immense snobbery of Harvard. Here's an extract from Alston Chase's book:

 The Murray Experiment
 
 PERHAPS no figure at Harvard at this time better embodied the ongoing war between science and humanism than Henry A. "Harry" Murray, a professor in Harvard's Department of Social Relations. A wealthy and blue-blooded New Yorker, Murray was both a scientist and a humanist, and he was one of Lewis Mumford's best friends. He feared for the future of civilization in an age of nuclear weapons, and advocated implementing the agenda of the World Federalist Association, which called for a single world government. The atomic bomb, Murray wrote in a letter to Mumford, "is the logical   predictable result of the course we have been madly pursuing for a hundred years." The choice now facing humanity, he added, was "One World or No World." Yet unlike Mumford, Murray maintained a deep faith in science. He saw it as offering a solution by helping to transform the human personality. "The kind of behavior that is required by the present threat," Murray wrote Mumford, "involves transformations of personality such as never occurred quickly in human history; one transformation being that of National Man into World Man." Crucial to achieving this change was learning the secret of successful relationships between people, communities, and nations. And coming to understand these "unusually successful relations" was the object of Murray's particular research: the interplay between two individuals, which he called the "dyad."
 
 The concept of the dyad was, in a sense, Murray's attempt to build a bridge between psychology and sociology. Rather than follow Freud and Jung by identifying the individual as the fundamental atom in the psychological universe, Murray chose the dyad -- the smallest social unit -- and in this way sought to unite psychiatry, which studied the psyches of individuals, and sociology, which studied social relations. This kind of research, he apparently hoped, might (as he put it in a 1947 paper) promote "the survival and further evaluation of Modern Man, "by encouraging the emergence of the new "world man" and making world peace more likely.
 
 Murray's interest in the dyad, however, may have been more than merely academic. The curiosity of this complex man appears to have been impelled by two motives -- one idealistic and the other somewhat less so. He lent his talents to national aims during World War II. Forrest Robinson, the author of a 1992 biography of Murray, wrote that during this period he "flourished as a leader in the global crusade of good against evil." He was also an advocate of world government. Murray saw understanding the dyad, it seems, as a practical tool in the service of the great crusade in both its hot and cold phases. (He had long shown interest, for example, in the whole subject of brainwashing.) During the war Murray served in the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, helping to develop psychological screening tests for applicants and (according to Timothy Leary) monitoring military experiments on brainwashing. In his book (1979), John Marks reported that General "Wild Bill" Donovan, the OSS director, "called in Harvard psychology professor Henry 'Harry' Murray" to devise a system for testing the suitability of applicants to the OSS. Murray and his colleagues "put together an assessment system ... [that] tested a recruit's ability to stand up under pressure, to be a leader, to hold liquor, to lie skillfully, and to read a person's character by the nature of his clothing.... Murray's system became a fixture in the OSS."
 
 One of the tests that Murray devised for the OSS was intended to determine how well applicants withstood interrogations. As he and his colleagues described it in their 1948 report "Selection of Personnel for Clandestine Operations -- Assessment of Men,"
 
     The candidate immediately went downstairs to the basement room. A voice from within commanded him to enter, and on complying he found himself facing a spotlight strong enough to blind him for a moment. The room was otherwise dark. Behind the spotlight sat a scarcely discernible board of inquisitors.... The interrogator gruffly ordered the candidate to sit down. When he did so, he discovered that the chair in which he sat was so arranged that the full strength of the beam was focused directly on his face....
 
     At first the questions were asked in a quiet, sympathetic, conciliatory manner, to invite confidence.... After a few minutes, however, the examiner worked up to a crescendo in a dramatic fashion.... When an inconsistency appeared, he raised his voice and lashed out at the candidate, often with sharp sarcasm. He might even roar, "You're a liar."
 
 Even anticipation of this test was enough to cause some applicants to fall apart. The authors wrote that one person "insisted he could not go through with the test." They continued, "A little later the director ... found the candidate in his bedroom, sitting on the edge of his cot, sobbing."
 
 Before the war Murray had been the director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic. After the war Murray returned to Harvard, where he continued to refine techniques of personality assessment. In 1948 he sent a grant application to the Rockefeller Foundation proposing "the development of a system of procedures for testing the suitability of officer candidates for the navy." By 1950 he had resumed studies on Harvard undergraduates that he had begun, in rudimentary form, before the war, titled "Multiform Assessments of Personality Development Among Gifted College Men." The experiment in which Kaczynski participated was the last and most elaborate in the series. In their postwar form these experiments focused on stressful dyadic relations, designing confrontations akin to those mock interrogations he had helped to orchestrate for the OSS.    









 This is in German with subs but it's the most interesting documentary I've seen on Kaczynski. The book Harvard and the Unabomber is also well worth a read.
