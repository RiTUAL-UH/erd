 It worth mentioning that the poem is meant as a parody of shows like Opera and how self harm is considered a taboo topic.  




 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Was an interesting book, very well written and wonderful world building. The ending made me pretty sad.  




 Stephan Dedalus from A portrait Of The Artist. May seem a masturbatory answer (oddly fitting due to the nature of the book). Just because I grew up very religious and very conflicted about my thoughts, feelings and desires. Not understanding the world. The joy and terror of being a bad person in your own eyes. Rejecting your previous beliefs once you become an adult. Deciding to pursue writing. 




 I like the concept and it's quite well written. I really enjoy the final line. I think it might be more effective if you placed the platitudes in bold. Or I guess you could just preface the preface the piece with an explanation. I think the piece could be more humorous and effective in other, less form heavy writing styles. Overall I think you did well! 




 [I Say I Say I Say] (http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/i-say-i-say-i-say/) by Simon Armitage. Just allowed me to laugh at my own self destructive past and recognise that its an oddly common thing.
