 Thanks. I was able to go to the webpage and like there I'm in the S fund. So, I guess I'm doing something right. Following these types of models could help in moving the money were it's more profitable, right? 




 The reason I'm asking it's because I've heard that people move the allocations based on the stock market.  




 I tried looking at the model but the webpage is not working. So such models would show me where it should be best to move my allocations? 




 Wouldn't I lose all my money if I invested in one fund? If I don't manage them, how can I make a decision in which one to use? What should I know or be paying attention to so I can choose one that would be more profitable? 




 The Thrift Savings Plan.
