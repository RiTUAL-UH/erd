 You're right, some of the responses are just... not... anything?

They're not funny or clever, it's just a sentence. Yet they get points.

I guess that's improv for you.

Either way I still watch the show and enjoy the shit outta it. My favourite part is when you get surprised by some of the guests. Did you guys see that recent episode with Eli Roth? That dude was hilarious and stole the show, who would've thought? 




 Guess it depends on your country, I'm an Australian who is 177 cm (5'9" and a half) and I'm of average height. 




 Kinda small? I mean isn't the national average 5'9"? 









 It's certainly both, but I wouldn't equate them as 50/50.

I'm very much looking forward to putting some lean mass on in a little bit for the reasons you've stated above :) 




 I found that losing weight made me exercise rather than the other way around. Initially I  just planned to control my diet and start exercising down the line.

But something curious happened.

A week into my efforts (after I saw the scale go down), I started sleeping better. I started having more energy. I got home from work, sat down and thought "shit, its sunny as hell outside I'm gonna go for a walk"

That has **never** happened before. That's how it started. 4 months later and I'm doing 20-30 minute jogs and loving it. 




 I exercise. And I am dead.

 Seriously. That's it.

I was at my place with a few friends. We were watching the game (she was watching from her own place), the second her team got knocked out, I decided to post on her Facebook wall "Hey X, our power just went out, did your team make it through the finals?"

I immediately got removed from Facebook and she didn't return any of my calls or texts. I really did try to contact her for a while and she wouldn't respond. Screw it, she wants to be this immature I don't really want to remain friends anyway.

Reflecting back on it, I don't think I would've appologised even if she asked. In no way was what I said mean or offensive. We had a relationship where we would make fun of each other all the time. I honestly thought she was stronger than that. Oh well.

And adding to that, he she have said "Listen, you stepped over the line. Don't make jokes about my sports team anymore" I would've stopped. But she didnt, she just clammed up and threw the baby out with the bath water.

edit: words 




 A car. Seriously.

I have the means to buy a relatively expensive car and I have several friends who actually did this.

I'd rather spend 11 grand on a 3-4 year old car and take decent care of it. I could squeeze a good decade out of a car like that.


As long as it runs and is has relatively low maintenance then I'm all set. I have zero want or need for an expensive new car. 




 Flossing.

Not going to lie, I always hated doing it. But for the past few months I decided to start forcing myself to floss right before bed and I find that it's actually really pleasant to go to bed with such clean teeth.

Also my teeth have never been whiter or stronger, so there's that. 




 OHHHHHH I GET IT NOW

MOSQUITOES == BUZZFEED

 




 Fucking get this. A good friend of mine threw 10 years of friendship down the drain because I made fun of her favourite football team not making it into the finals a few years ago.

So stupid 




 The context of the joke is that it's a German guy saying that line. 

It's like that scene in Beerfest where a cuckoo clock goes off and a German guy says "Zee fuck is zat?" 




 Just adding onto that, he also did a Celebrity Who Wants to be a Millionaire... He then failed on one of the first questions. The question was *What's 11 X 12?"

Yeah, that happened. 




 Thanks Kile. 




 But I just know that if I buy new XL clothes that I'll be in L clothes within the next month or so lol 




 Speaking of that, if you see Kyle can you let him know his coffee is ready? 




 Thanks, I will keep going for sure.

The worst part was trying to buy work slacks. I just could not find a place which sold decent work slacks which had a high enough waist.

Not a problem anymore of course :) 




 Aside from cardio 2-4 times a week, the majority of my effort is in the kitchen. Even then there is little secret.

I eat a good mix of food, but much less than before. I'm on a 1800-2000 calorie diet. I only drink water or the occasional coffee.

It really has been that simple, so simple in fact that I'm kicking myself I didn't start months ago.

If I were to give your question a simple 1 sentence answer, it would be this:

**I stopped eating and drinking like an unsupervised 15 year old** 




 Plus if they're just a little bit too small, it would make a pretty good tangible goal to work towards.

Every day the pants fit a little better. 




 I have to do jeans shopping too! My 42" jeans require my belt to go 4 notches in :D

I actually have no idea what pants size I am anymore, same deal with my work slacks. 




 Nailed it  




 These numbers are so unfathomably high, at what stage do you stop negotiating a higher salary? Surely he can't spend all of that money, right? 




 I started trying to lose weight a little over 4 months ago. About 3 months ago my 8-ball pool team was getting new club shirts made and they needed everyones sizes. We were told that it would take a few months to get them made and delivered. So I ummm'd and ahhh'd not knowing what my size would be in 2-3 months time. At my fattest I was wearing 3XL clothing, so I ordered 2XL because I had no idea how much I would lose.

Well, I had a pleasant surprise today. My shirt came in and what do you know. I'm not a 2XL anymore. Not even close.

I ended up trading it in for an XL shirt and it fits like a glove (maybe even a little loose :D). I'm an XL for now :)

I think it may be time to go shopping.

Edit: Oh wow, this blew up more than I thought it would. Good to see my NSV helped many of you :)

 Terminator 2: Judgement Day.

Oh god, did I watch this a lot growing up. 




 That was the first thing I did when I moved into my current place, I installed a lock :D

Since I share the house with 3 other guys, it's stopped a few awkward moments. 




 So myself and 4 others were playing last weekend and we enacted the Rando Cardrissian rule (essentially for each question we draw an additional face down card for each question and if that card wins, then the 'Rando' fake player gets the point). Normally when we play this rule, we get some funny combinations and Rando gets a few questions.

Not this fucking time.

Holy crap, Rando was on fire. He was pulling out crazy hilarious card combinations. Even winning a few multi card questions.

In the end I (21 wins) only **just** beat Rando (20 wins) and that came down to the last question remaining.

It was insane, has anyone else had this sort of luck with the house rules?

If you've not already, you should try this house rule. It's rather hilarious. 




 I'm confused, isn't there a review embargo?

 Most of the time reddit won't sugar coat it (hehe) for you, you'll get honest unbiased opinions.

cheating myself with lies or half-truths about my lifestyle.

Another subreddit you may get something out of is /r/fatlogic. Despite it's name, its actually a very support place where people (the majority of which are either obese or formerly obese) talk about these 'half truths and lies' most of us tell ourselves.

 




 It's a /r/thathappened gold mine! 




 It's *totally* a numbers game. I also like to think of it like being in debt. I currently am thousands of dollars in debt and the only way to get back into surplus is to sacrifice a little bit each pay day till I reach my goal balance. 




 Nonsense man, if we're willing to allow people to file their taxes completely online, then we should be willing to allow people to vote online. 




 I dont understand men who're so uncomfortable around women doctors. THEY'RE DOCTORS. IT'S THEIR JOB.

Years ago I had to have an groin inspection from a doctor, there just so happened to be a female on staff. She was nothing but professional and at no time did I feel uncomfortable.

You mention penis questions as a reason for wanting a male doctor. She knows equally as much about the male anatomy as the male doctors. If you want a male perspective, talk to your friends. If you want medical advice, talk to a doctor. 




 No need for luck, i have science on my side! 




 The last time I did a platonic tickle fight with a girl, we ended up hooking up.

So... nah : / 




 Without any further information about you, I can tell you that 5 lbs a week won't continue forever. Eventually, you'll start losing at around 1-2 lbs per week, which is a healthy drop rate. 




 Adding onto this, being able to do up your shoes without holding your breath :D 




 Be prepared for the weight loss to taper off, don't get discouraged! I can tell you that the first week I was so worried that I hadn't calculated my diet correctly.

I was so excited to stand on the scale after 7 days and see a smaller number. That validation was amazing :) 




 Well done, that's a huge effort.

My personal realisation? That the concept of 'healthy foods' is wrong.

You're better off seeing food as energy. Most people imagine a healthy diet as a diet which is nothing but foods which are labeled as healthy. 

Could you imagine eating a diet of nothing but fruits and vegetables? I would losing my fucking mind.

A 'healthy' diet should be a balanced one. So eat a mix of foods within your daily calorie budget. So have an ice cream on occasion, have an apple. Why not have chips AND salad with your steak?

Once you start labeling foods as either healthy or unhealthy you end up setting your diet up for failure. I had a big pile of bacon and eggs for lunch yesterday and I'm still losing weight. Because I ate under my deficit.

 




 You know what? I like Gohan the way he is. Hear me out, pls no downvotes!

To me, he is a trope buster. You know that 'chosen one, must rise to the occasion' trope? Well he turns it on his head, to me Gohan is the audience. Most of us were his age in the early DBZ and we were all wishing we were the son of the great Goku. As the series goes on, he is told over and over about his great potential as a warrior and as a man. But with that comes the realisation of "just because I can, doesn't mean I should".

The Cell saga was my favourite saga of the entire series and this was mainly because of Gohan. I enjoyed the way that his character decided that he didn't really want that life anymore after Cell. He wanted to live his life since his childhood was sorta stolen away from him due to the previous sagas.

In the end, he will always answer the call to fight and defend his world but he won't devote his life to maintaining his power. 

So yeah, they could've made Gohan a mirror of his father but I think they gave him real depth by making him more well rounded as a character. He also answers the question we've all asked ourselves "Would I want to be the son of the great Goku? Could I handle the responsibility? How would my life be affected?" 




 Iain Glenn's RL accent is amazing to listen to. He did the audiobooks for one of the ASOIAF prequels and it was so fucking good.

Roy Dotrice is the master, but Iain is an excellent substitute. 




 That's the problem with dialogue based films, if you're not into the characters/story/discussion, then the long ass conversations can seem superfluous.

I enjoyed the fuck outta that movie :D 




 You've never had it? It's amazing, 9 out of 10 Doctors agree. 




 Ironically I think you woosh'd his satire 




 I don't understand it, it is a system which could be completely digitised. The Australian Government already digitises so much of our lives, why not this?

It's compulsory for us, I can only imagine how many people in the US don't vote only because "It was too much of a hassle".

Fine, you want your freedom from compulsory voting. At least reduce the hassle so that you increase voter turn out. 




 I'm going to chime in, because technically I'm allowed.

I was born in the U.S back in 87' but I've been living in Australia the majority of my life. 

I actually kinda wish I was over there with you guys, getting into the celebration. While I see myself as an Aussie through and through, I do kinda still feel some sort of connection to the states.

Luckily for me I have dual citizenship, so if I wanted to, I could live with you doods :) 




 thank mr skeletal 4 the calcium 




 I'm pregnant and it's yours. 




 On an episode of the Gruen Transfer, someone came up with a hilarious idea for marketing. 

Create a blank business called "9 out of 10 Doctors" and tack their label onto your product.

"9 out of 10 Doctors would recommend Asbestos Chewing Gum" is no longer false advertising. 




 This thread has been a good read gals, but I'm going to keep losing this weight no matter how you tempt me! :D 




 Also, see Argo.

Affleck made both of those movies incredible, the fucker is 2 for 2.

I think /u/tastypinksock 's anger is a little unwarranted, unless he's only seen pre-2010 Affleck. 




 I think Reynolds is a good actor that has a bad agent.

I was going to make a post, but you summed up all I was really going to say. The above line is my main point.

I have a bit of a man crush on Ryan Reynolds and he truely seems like a hilarious person outside of acting. But he hasn't chosen his movies well **at all**.

The only dramatic role I appreciated him in was Smokin Aces and that's not really saying much.

The dude really needed to get a role with this season of True Detective of something. Go back and do some more hefty dramatic roles.  




 Holy shit what a week. 

I'm so sad at the timing of LA Confidential's release, but who knows - had it have been a massive hit, we might have a whole bunch of stupid sequels. This way we can enjoy the movie as it is :D 




 What's the rate of homosexuality among pedophiles?

Is it the same as the general population?

 




 Australia - Animal Kingdom, Chopper, Romper Stomper, The Castle and Rogue.

There are many more, but these are the first few which come to mind.

As you can see, our gritty crime dramas are top notch. 




 Amazing fucking movie, everyone should check it out.

While you're at it, watch Chopper. Both are Australian crime classics. 




 **L.A Confidential** - it is one of my favourite movies growing up and it held up after all of these years. There is little about this movie which was bad, I couldn't look away.


After watching Terminator Genesys try to gut a franchise that I love, I found solace in a classic film which will likely never have the sting of a shitty sequel. 




 Yep, been a thing for a long time :D

Something lots of us work towards  




 Is what a thing now? 









 Hey guys,

I've been holding off on progress pics for a while now because I don't really see that much of a change in them (my clothes are all practically falling off, it's just the side by side which doesn't seem that much different).

Either way, 4 months in and I'm finally over the half way point for onderland. Still very much going strong. Thanks for all of your help my friends. My next progress post will be in onederland I hope :D

For the sake of clarity, I've been on a 1800-2000 guestimation calorie diet (not counting calories religiously, I just have a general idea of how much is in my food and I budget around it), I'm losing around about 2 lbs per week and as I'm edging closer I'm adjusting my diet ever so slightly. 

I do cardio at the gym 2-4 times a week. It was previously 45 minutes of fast walking with intermittent jogging bouts. But now I've worked my way up to 30 minute session which is 5 minute warm up walk, 20 minute solid jog and 5 minute cooldown. Which is actually one of my goals! **Hooray for NSVs**. 

I know there are a lot of people at /r/loseit who are really close to my stats. **Keep at it**, trust me. You'll wish you'd started earlier. I know I do :)

Thanks for being awesome guys. [Here's the progress!](http://i.imgur.com/V6h1Krf.jpg)



 




 Norton has assured me that all traces of that virus has been removed. 




 Niceeeeeeee

Keep it up man, i'll be there in a few months :D 




 Sorry, I don't have google installed :(

I'm sorry for any pain and anguish that I caused you. Not sure if that's a thing. 




 the plus-sized section... (which may I add, isn't called such, because it would be offensive to call it like it is) It's another story.

Oh come on, that's literally what it is.

Plus size is already a fucking watered down euphemism. 




 Nope :)

*Mate* is also an excellent way to save yourself in those situations where you forget someones name.

"Oh, hey... *Mate*...." 




 Awww, I clicked this link hoping you had discovered some ground breaking zero calorie dip. 

I'll just keep eating celery dipped in water. 




 Diabetes induced blindness? Not sure if that's a thing 




  I'm rocking the reverse hitler PLUS the patchy beard.

Are you me? The reverse hitler is literally hitler.

At least my cheek hair is starting to fill out : / 




 I may or may not have changed my weigh in day from early Monday morning to late Sunday morning because of this....

 




 I've been off the butts for almost 2 years now. You can do it! Mind over matter. 




 I'm a man of routine, so I did some intial research into the calories of my favourite meals. Once I had those figures, I built my daily budget around it. It's been 4 months and I'm down 43 lbs via this guestimation method.

My diet is around 1800-2000 cal per day. 




 I totally keep missing weekly check ins lol

Oh well, my loss is still consistent :) 




 It's a fine line between preachy and informative. I personally don't bring anything up unless they ask. If they're interested in trying, then i'll help them out. If they say any /r/fatlogic, I'll politely discuss it with them. But this all depends on the friend.

At the end of the day, I've not said a single damn syllable about my weight loss on social media. So only the people who've physically seen me of late know. This is mainly to avoid being preachy (I see some douchy stuff on Facebook about weight loss).

My plan is to make a single post with progress pictures once I reach my first goal, then I'm not going to bring it back up again. 




 If if this thread is "Just For Kicks", then why are we posting pants size? :P


M/5'9"/242lbs/**see below**

I'm not sure lol. I really am not. I need to go clothes shopping but at the progress I'm going at, I know i'll just end up needing to buy new clothes in a month or so.

For context I bought an XL hoodie and that fits rather nicely and my 42 inch work pants (which I used to wear without a belt) now need my belt adjusted to the 3rd belt hole. Also, my 3XL shirts are far too big now. I could probably wear an XL comfortably :) 




 That's why Australia is good, *mate* is both gender neutral and formal enough for most settings that your average person encounters :)

*Excuse me mate*, *sorry mate*, *g'day mate* or *thanks mate* are the most commonly stated phrases down under. 




 Make sure you time your weekly laundry well. I do mine Sunday night so that my entire weeks worth of clothes are GTG before work on Monday. 




  the leaked casting calls pretty much confirmed that Euron

I know it sounds like it could be Euron, I take issue with the statement that it *pretty much confirms* that Euron will appear.
 




  whenever I see a more than moderately attractive woman, my reflex is to assume she's either a total bitch ~~or~~ **and** taken

FTFY

 




 The leaked casting call asked for a pirate, that doesn't confirm anything. Had you said "there is hope", I may have agreed with you.

I'm being realistic, there is no need for the Greyjoys to get intertwined with Danys story, she has her own fleet in Meereen. 




 This is what annoys me, I absolutely **love** Spartacus and Jai was one of the best characters in it. I want him to succeed so much... But he keeps picking shit projects and ends up giving shit performances.

He needs a reboot (his career I mean, not a movie), or perhaps a dramatic role in a TV series. I mean the dude is still young... Kinda. 




 Speaking as an Australia, I was totally shocked too. His accent completely hides any trace of Australian accent.

He's one of my favourite actors going around right now. Awesome in Zero Dark Thirty and Rise of the Planet of the Apes 




 Guys... I really don't want to spoil your fun but.....

I think the Greyjoy plot is done with for the show : /

Perhaps there will be some follow up, but Balon Watch will continue forever.... Like a lover waiting at the pier for her husband long lost at sea. 




 Dude discovered the secrets of relativtitty 




 Oh god his Cinnabon bit is exceptional 




 I appreciate your hyperbole, never change. 




 Maybe not ridiculous, but it sure was stupid.

Years ago I had prided myself on always taking care of my phone. I've never lost one or damaged one. This was mainly because I would always be careful handling them and I would always slap my pocket where it normally lives before I leave the house or do what ever.

So anyway, one day I was at the GFs place and in my board shorts. Before I dived in, I did the old thigh slap to check that my phone wasnt in either of my front pockets. Not in there, good job train_subject5967.

So I dive in and have a swim. After swimming around for a while and I lean up against the wall of the pool and feel something poking my lower leg.

**Its my fucking phone**. I now realise that these board shorts don't have side pockets but they have pockets at the bottom of each leg. So that's where I logically stored my phone when I changed.


**TL;DR Phone storage hubris cause the destruction my pursuit of life long phone preservation**
 




 I wonder how many people like me thought your name was pronounced **Warli-Zard**. I'm an idiot. 




 Arr lmao 




 I first saw breaking bad episode to episode from the get go and i found her annoying.

I recently went back and rewatched the whole series back to back and my opinion has changed, i totally sympathised with her.

It must be because watching episodss week to week over many years causes you to forget the context of her actions. 




 It's brutal, because I notice them and my brain tells me "Don't stare man, she's here to work on herself and doesn't want to be gawked at". So a glance will do.

That being said, it works well for motivation. I see girls at the gym and think "Keep doing what you're doing any you could end up with one of these hotties" 




 my current boyfriend messaged me with only "i choose you"

Bold move.

I like it 




 I've only had 1 break up which I could best describe as *amicable* and that was my most recent one.

It was very mature, almost like I was dating an adult.

I sat down with her and had a long talk, she understood and empathised, I understood and empathised with her. In the end, she accepted it and a bunch of our conversation was about how to deal with some of the other stuff logistically speaking. Getting our stuff from each others houses, how to tell everyone etc.

I came away from it thinking that she too was looking for a way out.

What I **can** tell you guys is that if you really don't want to be in a relationship. Leave it. I felt 1000x better after finally leaving and I've spoken to her since, she feels the same way. 




 I lived in the 90s from age 3 till 13 which is when I defined myself as a 'kid'. 




 But how do you know that the man that you're approaching doesn't also have near debilitating anxiety? 




 The obsession that people have in their 20s with alcohol is stupid and rather unhealthy. While I'm not going to be completely sober for the rest of my life, I certainly don't drink to get *fucked up* anymore 




 After being dumped by a girl I ended up trying to fill that hole with some random hook up. We ended up moving in together immediately and I didnt even really like her all that much. Turns out she was also coming out of a break up and we were both doing the exact same thing to each other. 

We ended up breaking up and she moved out in the middle of the night owing us rent money.

0/10 would not do again 




 Agreed. Doesn't the threat of true mortality add more beauty to our lives?

Wow that came out more pretentious than I would've liked.

Cunty McFuck-Fuck.

That's better. 




 Six Feed Under. What a series finale.

It was so fucking perfect, a hour long *where are they now* for all the remaining cast. 




 I'm down 43 lbs from 285 lbs and I've found little difference in interactions. I know that I interact differently to people though. Now that I started losing weight, I'm sleeping better which means I have more energy which means I'm more out going which means that I'm more willing to be chatty with people.

So in that regard my interactions have changed.  




 Blue waffle. 




 Yeah you're correct there I think. I love Orion but it doesn't hold a candle to Suicide and Redemption. I can't wait for their 10th album, I hope they do another epic instrumental!! 




 To be honest, you're doing the best way. Cheat meals are better for sustainability than cheat days I find.

Having that friday night dinner where you have a massive steak meal with a couple of beers will make you feel so much better than a full day of drinking and bad food.

 




 I never ever understood people who can't talk to customers. 

7 years in retail has taught me that if you're nice to even the most horrible customers, you end up having a better time with them.

I ended up developing what I call a *customer assistance voice*. Which is essentially if you take your nicest demeanor, multiple it by 2, increase your voice by an octave, smile **a lot** and be overly sympathetic. It's so easy to do that I often wonder if I'm a sociopath.

So when I see people in the service industry who grimace and are rude to customers I find it completely unacceptable. **We get it, you hate your fucking job. But you're in a fucking customer facing job so do it correctly for christs sake.**
