 Is there anything said or shown in the video that gives an indication of when it was filmed?

 For the curious, this makes it the film with the most fucks ever. [There's a wiki page about this.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_that_most_frequently_use_the_word_%22fuck%22)

 A documentary called "Fuck" from 2005 about the word itself contains it 857 times, but I don't think that really counts.

 A nude, screaming dancer found trapped under a man's crushed body on a trick piano pinned against a nightclub ceiling was too drunk to remember how she got there, police said.

...

 The dead man's body provided 2 or 3 inches of cushion that kept the woman from being crushed. 




 That's right, it was a happy place. They had flowery meadows and rainbow skies, and rivers made of chocolate, where the children danced and laughed and played with gumdrop smiles.

 Something I noticed: there's a little dig at the then Soviets:

 We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.

 A lot of Brazilians are going to be **really** pissed off about this. Search the words "luto" or "vergonha" on twitter. I'm sure there will be another catchphrase of the night.

Edit: yes, there is a new hashtag, that was quick: #RIPBrasil 




  I want to apologize for inconveniencing you while trying to protect the lives of millions.

Very true. What this quarantine is doing is protecting the political lives of Governors Christie and Cuomo. 




 This would be right if this quarantine *was* "protecting people from a seriously lethal threat". It isn't. Ebola isn't transmissable until an infected person is gravely ill. We knew that before, and we know that now. The *only* two cases transmitted in the US were nurses who treated patient zero Duncan near death spewing infected fluid everywhere, while wearing ineffective PPE.

It was the pathetic initial response by the CDC in providing the Dallas hospital with adequate protection that was a "seriously lethal threat" to these nurses. Thankfully they have recovered. What's happening now is a fearful over-reaction. 









 The study being referenced is [here.](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-014-2995-6/fulltext.html) 









 And it remains the single greatest movie about snakes on a plane in film history. 









 Perhaps the Dallas Cowboys should switch to black for Ebola Awareness Month. 









 This is comparable to the Dallas Cowboys' value of about $3.2 billion, and the Yankees' value of about $2.5 billion. Basketball and hockey teams are nowhere near as rich.

 It gets worse: [Second ebola nurse traveled on plane with low-grade fever.](http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/health/2014/10/15/second-dallas-hospital-worker-diagnosed-ebola/17290677/) 




 This is what they should have done with Duncan when he was diagnosed. The Dallas hospital was *not* prepared for ebola - two infected nurses demonstrate that. 









 [This article](http://jezebel.com/5899815/how-does-ovulation-affect-a-strippers-income-it-doesnt) explains how the study behind this "fact" may be flawed. The sample size was way too small:

 Two researchers at UNM in Albuquerque studied dancers for two months. They studied 18 dancers. In one club, in one city. For two cycles.

Evidently, a **lot** more field research needs to be done on this phenomenon, before it can be confirmed. 









 "TIFU by joining ISIS and getting knocked up by a Jihadi." 




 I'd take this story with a grain of salt. Here is the questionable source:
