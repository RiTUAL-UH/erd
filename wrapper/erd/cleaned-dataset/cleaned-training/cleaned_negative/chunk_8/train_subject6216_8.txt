 Lol yes :p   she's my baby and is quite adored so I felt the need to make sure everyone saw her beautiful side too  . 




 Lol thank you. Sorry, for being defensive. The little pugbutt is my world 




 I'm sure they don't like you either..

She may be stocky but she isn't super fat 




 [Still think so?](http://imgur.com/TWY9EWT)  
  
She is just stocky 




 [Seriously not obese](http://imgur.com/TWY9EWT) 




 She isn't. She just scrunched herself back to sneeze.. Shes walked twice a day and runs around in the back yard and is only fed 2/3's of a cup of kibble twice a day... 




 Have you been around pugs much?  




 She gets 2/3 cup of food in the morning and at night. She is not overfed. Just a pug 




 Didn't know about that one lol. I think I shall repost this over there   :)  thank you. People must view the silly pug
