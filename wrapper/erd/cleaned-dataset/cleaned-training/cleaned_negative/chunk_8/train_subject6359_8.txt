 Half of the world doesn't get it haha 




 Woooow great joke bro. I am LITERALLY rolling on the ground laughing 




 if you like, theres more at http://www.train_subject6359.com. thanks for looking :) 









 They are the clowns of the dog world! Mine never stops derping 




 Around $40. Each frame cost probably $4  




 This makes so much more sense than my way 




 Haha it's just a joke. 400 degrees for 10 minutes with a pan of boiling water on the lower rack is what the internet said to do 




 Where the light touches the emulsion, it hardens to the screen. The part that a covered does not so you can then wash that part out and it becomes a stencil pretty much 




 Bangalore. Represent 




 This is so cool! Ah that skull. I'm an artist and I would love to have used that for something. 




 It was [based off a painting I did](http://i.imgur.com/s627PN7.jpg). I didn't know about the wendigo at the time but people kept asking me if that's what it was so I looked it up and god damn that is some cool folklore. 




 I was considering using 14k halides from my aquarium. Good thing it happened to be sunny that day :p 




 That depends on how fond of drinking beer and passing out in the sun with your dog you are. In other words, yes. 




 I'm sure it will work the same assuming you use ink that is meant for metal. I have a Gibson LPJ myself ;) 




 bulldog jammie borthers for life 




 I read online that they have to get above 320 Fahrenheit to cure properly. It's swampy as hell in Chicago too though. So glad I chose a tank over a tee haha 




 I've been doing some research on rigs. As an added bonus it will give me an excuse to go to home depot, my favorite store haha. If I can sell a few paintings this summer I will definitely make it happen 




 If I were to cook a shirt in the oven, I'd put it in a pan in a 400 degree oven with another pan of boiling water below it for 10 minutes but I would never do that, nor would I encourage others to do it. 




 I'm not sure of the mesh size but thanks for the info! I want to give multicolor a try later this summer I'll have to try and save up for aluminum. This one was just a simple design though so I felt like I could pull off doing it on the cheap 




 Should have clarified that. But I want to give multicolor a try later this summer 




 I cleaned it. That's strange I will have to see what happens with mine. Only used it once so far 




 Your jealousy is understandable 




 You can buy premade screens! You'll never know til you try 




 I used the oven. 2 washes in and the design is still looking like new. Just make sure you keep an eye on it if you do 




 I meant for a simple design like this. I'm sure it takes a while to learn multiple colors and finer details. Thanks for the tips! 




 I need them to be long so that they'll fit around the necks of my foot strangling victims 




 Wait what? I ate like half the jar 




 $12 for emulsion

$10 for ink

$4 for wood and screen

$7 for squeegee

$7 for transparency

So about 40 bucks I'd say 




 I like to bend it backwards when my thumb is pinned and insist that it's still up. Technically correct is the best kind of correct. 




 To be determined haha. Hopefully forever! 




 Yep I flooded this one. I'm looking into all that for the future. I just applied the emulsion with the squeegee but I don't like how it dripped 




 The sun hardens the emulsion so that it is not soluble in water 




 [is this normal](http://i.imgur.com/Ldejocs.jpg) 




 That and it also guides the screw in nice straight 




 Water based. The best way to make sure you don't destroy the emulsion is to let the water pressure do all the work. You can see mine has some rough edges but that's actually how the positive was. It came out almost identical 




 I considered doing that but this way is just so cool and science-riffic 




 I used the speedball fabric ink. I am 2 washes in and very happy with the results. 




 Thanks for the invite. I'll bring the beer 




 Hey I still have 2 screens left. Anything could happen 




 I skip leg day to screen print. 




 People like you are the reason I love the internet. 




 Any kind of heat as long as it exceeds 320 degrees. Safest way is to put a towel over it and just iron it 














 1st year medical student here, can confirm I know less than Chapped_Assets 




 I love his little leggies 




 Approximately infinty 




 His opinion is also wrong. 




 I dunno man that saint Virginia looks like she could have died a week ago and has no mask. I wonder how they did that 




 Dammit 




 That area controls motor and sensory functions, language, and probably some memory among other things but nothing particularly vital located in there so you could definitely survive that. It would just be a very rough life. The more important stuff is located in the basal ganglia and brainstem which are inside and below the brain.

Edit: whoosh :( 




 I agree about this piece and a lot of others but there is still good stuff here fairly often. If you come across an r/heaviermind let me know 




 Ironic you should say that because "whooooooa it's almost like I'm 14 again" is about as unoriginal as a comment can get on this subreddit.

 




 Nobody's forcing you to subscribe 




 This is true 




 Mwditerranean diet. Good luck finding a problem with that one. 




 I woke up in a certified preowned bugatti 




 Damn dude my friends live in Lakeview and pay around 700 each for 4 people. Living alone is pricey 




 I fully agree with you but when you throw around words like "stancefags" you kind of sound like a douche 




 My rule of thumb is that if you're wondering if it's a birstleworm or a fireworm then it's a birstleworm. Of it's a fireworm you'll know 




 I had a moray who could have easily swallowed my electric blue damsel whole but that fucker bullied the moray to the point where I had to take the damsel back to the store. They're bad news man 




 Keep an eye on it dude they invert their mouths to eat. Awesome and creepy

Edit: evert 




 I fucking love it 




 Jumping from like 10 feet is scary. Anticipating the ankle shock 









 Did Tampa let it go to waste or did chicago show them who's boss ;) 




 Wait I'm confused. So you carry the zeros and multiply it by 100 since its a percent so... in the end he gave him... a handjob? 




 A lot of heavy art uses antlers so I'm sure there's been something similar in here 




 I can show you the yellow king. 




 I agree, awesome art style. Looks like someone skips leg day though haha 




 I left my jeeyacket and my peeyants in my beeyackpeeyack 




 I am honored :) 




 there's just something otherworldly about them 




 Thanks man! Does look a little similar 




 Thanks man! I like to stick with black and white since I'm too lazy to mix colors :p There are prints on the site if you're interested. 




 Actually that's a good idea. I'll see if I can figure out how to do that. Thanks!

 Come on man, were nowhere near as bad as Wiscahnsin 




 Speak for yourself man. The winters here are brutal. I'm all for moving to Mercury. 




 Yin Yang by motherfucking literal second coming of Jesus with a side of bacon, Dalip Singh. 




 EXACTLY. nobody knows who he is and that's the genius of his plan. 




 Can confirm. Our basement flooded flooded when we were on vacation and if not for good guy neighbor, my drums among other things would have been fucked. 




 Yessir 




 Thanks man. They didn't like it much over in r/bladerunner so I appreciate "relevant" :) 




 I didn't mean it condescendingly. A robot has no reason to feel any emotional response toward rain without a sense of wonder, which is a uniquely human trait. Which is what I tried to portray. If you didn't get that from it then my style just isn't for you I suppose. 




 How was I being a dick? The whole motive of the replicants was that they were in love and wanted longer life to experience it. 




 It's a nonhuman looking to experience the things that humans do. The plot of the entire movie.

 Did someone say Ra Lu? 




 Hahaha me too. Reminded me of a car trying to do a lap on a track covered in jello. 




 I had a blue damsel that would back up into my snowflake eels face and use his tail to blast sand into the poor guys eyes. He easily could have eaten the damsel if he wanted. I ended up returning the damsel. Those fuckers are crazy. 




 Who the fuck cares? Its reasonably detailed instructions on how to do it and just happens to have a kick starter link. As long as the instructions are there I don't see a reason to be upset. He even posted what magnets he used. 




 Stop youre going to make him have another episode. 




 I did a project on this in grade school. deep ocean is my shit. So much cool stuff down there. 




 Hahaha I know. Half the videos on this sub are pretty ridiculous. Did not know that about the banana though. That's pretty cool.
