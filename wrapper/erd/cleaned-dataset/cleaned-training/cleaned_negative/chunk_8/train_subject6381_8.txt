 It wasn't at all! it was pan seared and finished in the oven :) 




 I'll post it once I'm home from work! it's actually incredibly easy. I make it through the week and it really only takes an hour or so altogether. 




 Best compliment I've gotten for my food yet hahaha 



















 TIL a lot of men appreciate green eyes  :) which is awesome 




 Truly I am... not offended? I understand his intentions and that's all that matters haha. 

If I had insecurities regarding the things he pointed out it may have been different though. But I do not :) 




 It's the highest form of compliment. 




 Well I've aaaalways wanted grey eyes! 




 Well I'm sorry that's all that matters to you.. 




 If you're living in Toronto you just might :)
