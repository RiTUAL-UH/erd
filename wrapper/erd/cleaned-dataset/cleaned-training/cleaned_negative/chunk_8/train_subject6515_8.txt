 Mr. T thinks you're a wuss. 




 Me too. Man, those were the days... 




 It's fun to reminisce. 




 Don't remember that one. 




 It's too recognizable and would give away my identity.

 Didn't realize they made a Steve Urkel cereal. WTH? 




 Never tried either of those.

 OK, yo! 




 Posted a pic of myself when I was maybe 6 years old on another site. Someone commented and said, "looks like you're about to be on a Life Cereal commercial". So, me being a geek decided to Photoshop the pic on a Life Cereal box and post as a reply (which I did). Happy now? 




 Question blocks are horrible 




 Could be because they were fortified with 9 essential vitamins and minerals. 




 Well, only one box is in the image. 




 Sounds stupid, but here it goes. I was searching for a Life Cereal box image so I could Photoshop an old pic of myself on the box (the reason for doing this is a different story). As I was searching, I came across a Batman cereal box, and it instantly brought back memories. From there, I searched for other vintage cereal boxes and came across the Nintendo box, which is my favorite. Mmmkay? 




 We are no longer friends. 




 "Free Action Poster!" 




 and [this] (http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101204020423/batman/images/d/d5/Cereal.jpg)

 Union Square Hotel obviously doesn't have the same mindset as [Yelp] (http://i.imgur.com/7rtiNMP.jpg) 




 Yelp review count appears to be dropping now... 




 It takes a few days for TripAdvisor reviews to appear. Brace yourselves... 




 This one takes the cake:

"My girlfriend and I stayed here over the weekend. They limited us to one poop per day or we were to be charged an "Excess Waste Fee" of $200. Had to put a cork in my ass just to save ourselves a couple Benjamins.

Never, ever, again." 




 It takes a few days for TripAdvisor to manually review each submission. Expecting a flood of bad reviews in T minus 2-3 days! 




 It wouldn't be secure if it was just e-mailed. DUH! 









 Summary: Don't spend any money.
