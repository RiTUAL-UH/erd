 I'm what I like to call a 'recovering emetophobic, haha. I got extremely sick and it helped to ....desensitize me, I guess, but before that, I hadn't thrown up in 7 years. I read somewhere that Emetophobics learn to bypass the specific breathing pattern that lets your body know 'it's time to throw up' which I think may have some truth to it, because now even when I /want/ to throw up I cant. 




 Driving. I'm absolutely terrified to drive. I'm 30 and I've never done the thing. But. I'm working myself up to take my learner's soon.... 




 You too, bro! Be free in your love for T-Swift. She's cute and knows how to sell records, and that's more than I can say about myself, haha. :P (PS Trouble and Shake it Off are undeniably catchy and great.) 




 UGH I ALMOST INCLUDED THIS ONE IN THE MAIN POST. I dont hate it as much as Bad Blood but close. It's so, so grating and I have to hear it on the radio and then in commercials.  




 I hate it. I don't judge you for liking it but I hate it so, so very much. It makes me Hulk levels of angry.
