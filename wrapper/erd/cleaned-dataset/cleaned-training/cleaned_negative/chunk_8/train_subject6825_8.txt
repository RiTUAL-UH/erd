 Lead exposure is easily mitigated by refraining from handling food at the range, and washing your hands, gun cleaning solvents can be dealt with the same way any other cleaning product is used, by ventilating the area, and unless these doctors and the administration are advocating for removing suppressors from being regulated as NFA Title II devices, I call shenanigans on the notion that they actually care about hearing damage in any meaningful way.

Furthermore, any and all health issues can easily be dealt with by simply distributing a pamphlet that covers basic gun safety, storage, and cleaning procedures with zero need to actually record such information in a database that can be accessed by an army of medical professionals and faceless bureaucrats.

 It's actually a point of pride with them.

 Chip away at it incrementally. 

For instance, The American Silencer Association has been slowly getting laws passed at the state level to make suppressor use more acceptable and mainstream.  




 Exactly this. She's a nobody looking to pad her reel out with some pro-bono work for a graboid non-profit.

She probably pitched the idea to them, and they ate it up.

 I doubt they thought it would cause controversy, because these people are so utterly dense that they didn't even stop to consider how this would play out in the real world. 




 They don't know, or care about the law; it doesn't matter because gun control is all about feelings and emotion. 




 That's just the place if you like Cummingtonite! 




 LOL!

Stay classy, /r/guns! 




 Did I miss something?

Have they moved on to idolizing SKSs now too?

 




 I bet your stories are hilarious.

There's nothing more cringy/hilarious than a military officer who has the rank but not the knowledge. 




 /r/guns only likes gun photos if they're taken with an outdated potato phone with poor auto-focus, and the subject matter is limited to box-stock Glocks or Mosin Nagants.

The fact that you went to the time and effort to assemble a rifle that makes you happy, as well as the fact that you're apparently skilled with a camera all but guaranteed that the gaggle of no-talent ass-clowns at /r/guns would hate it. 




 I'venever seen that photo of the soldiers facing off over the line. That is really intense.

I've always liked the picture of the East German soldier jumping the barbed wire in order to defect.

 That's a grate idea. Like having your own personal primetime. 




 Amazon has already started doing this for some movies on their streaming service. 




 Always remember, when gun control fails, the solution is always more gun control!  




 "Assault weaponsjust like armor-piercing bullets, machine guns, and plastic firearmsare a new topic. The weapons' menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-automatic assault weaponsanything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine guncan only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons. In addition, few people can envision a practical use for these weapons."

-Josh Sugarmann, founder of the Violence Policy Center, "Assault Weapons and Accessories in America," 1988

That's just one quote. There are plenty more where that came from. 

A lot of average Joes support gun control because that's what the media and their leaders tell them is good. 

However, at the highest levels, make no mistake, the officials and policy makers who support gun control aren't just simply misinformed. They are outright lying to you, me, and the American people.

To people like Dianne Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, gun control is purely an issue of instituting policies that consolidate power in the hands of a wealthy and well-connected political elite.  




 The claim is that by limiting people to only one gun per month that it would stop people from buying a case of cheap pistols and then turning around and trafficking them to buyers in states with stricter laws. 

 




 It's not like there isn't precedent. 

Nearly every sheriff in Colorado said the same thing about the gun control laws passed there. 




 Speaking very broadly, the "pro" version of a pistol will possibly include the following upgrades:

Longer barrel
Better trigger
Upgraded sights (adjustable and or fiber optic)
Flared magazine well 
Extended magazine release

Which options show up will depend on the make/model of pistol. 

In a lot of cases, terms like "pro," "target," "sport," "competition," and especially "tactical" have been so diluted by marketing hype that they don't really mean anything any more.  









 The guy had multiple people at gun point in a standoff situation that lasted hours. 

Had he wanted to kill them, he could have easily done so, at his leisure, even with a pump action shotgun. 

Hell, using a shot timer, I've actually run side-by-side drills of firing a pump vs semi-auto shotgun, and the difference in the rate of fire amounted to a couple of seconds. 

A two-second difference to do a mag dump doesn't matter in a situation where the perpetrator has the better part of two days to do as he pleases.  




 Why does fruit cake have such a bad rap? 

Well, try some fruit cake and you will have your answer.  



















 Because the people who say stuff like that are the sort of coward who would be completely incapable of using a gun in self defense.

They then project their abject cowardice onto everyone else. 




 It's a fake.

 Outgoing Senate Democrats to America: "Fuck you!" 









 Aren't you the slack-jawed halfwit who thinks that a single mother should be taken away from her children, convicted of a felony, and thrown in prison because she dared to cross a state line with a handgun? 




 So you don't have an actual plan, but you do know that your not-an-actual plan doesn't involve anything like actually participating in any civic proceedings. 

I know! You should totally call me a statist a few more times, I bet that will get our rights back toot-sweet.  




 In Frum's mind, shooting can't possibly be fun. 

The only way to have fun is by joining a posh country club and lounging around while wearing a sweater with the sleeves tired around his shoulders. 

 




 If you've got a surefire plan to win back all of our list gun rights by next week, I'm all ears.  




 If public perception changed so that there's was widespread understanding that violent crime is at record lows, it would make things far more difficult for anti-gun advocates to make their case. 

However, anti-gun groups and officials would remain largely unchanged in their goals because if you get then to answer honestly, they support gun control not because of crime or violence, but because of an over-arching need to exercise control over others. 

Crime is simply the pretext. An obsessive need to control others is the actual reason.  














 Probably one of those perky high school students who plays a couple of sports and think she's got it all figured out because she gets good grades and volunteered at a homeless shelter once. 

 









 The FBI Uniform Crime Report is released annually, and it has pretty much all the stats on crime, including a breakdownxof the types of weapons used.

The CDC has some information on violent crime and self defense as well. 




 Even if that's the long term goal (and it would be a multi-generational undertaking), there's no point in advocating for it right now.

Our rights were lost a little bit at a time, and that's the only way we will regain them. 




 We owe it to ourselves and our civil liberties to policy e our own ranks. 




 I didn't move goal posts, though I admit I should have perhaps been more specific, as it is the DNC and higher ups in the party that hate private gun ownership, at the state and local levels the democrats tend to be, if not more aligned with their constituents, then at least pragmatic about placating them. 

But any presidential contender for the Democratic party will bow to anti-gun pressure, and that pressure will come from the party bosses, donors, and senior members serving in high-level elected positions. 

Hell, based on the posts here, Webb had tried to play both sides of the fence on background checks, claiming to support them for gun shows, but not other private party transfers. 

I guarantee you that stance, milquetoast as it is, will harden to a full on support for Bloomberg-style mandatory checks.

I will again point to the DNC stance on the 2nd Amendment. 

It's pure anti-rights BS with a thin candy shell so that the credulous will swallow it.  




 It's interesting that the actual text from the DNC actually makes no policy recommendations for preserving or expanding 2nd amendment rights, but does make several policy recommendations for curbing them. 

If friendly phrasing is all it takes to convince you that Democrats aren't a threat, then I'm not sure there's anything I can do to convince you otherwise, because you're clearly more interested in buying into fantasy than in dealing with political reality.  




 Exactly this.  




 If he doesn't fit the party line mold, then it's highly unlikely he'll receive meaningful support from the DNC. 

If he gets the nod, the DNC will require him to change his stance on guns.

You can see the same thing in places like Colorado. Hickenlooper was a moderate pro-business Dem who's stance on guns was neutral-to-pro, right up until he started getting calls from the VP and Bloomburg.  




 STATE level Dem systems may grudgingly acknowledge gun rights, but the national party hates them. 

Go read the DNC party platform regarding guns if you don't believe me.  




 That's true. 

Let's just say I have a fairly cynical outlook on the American justice system and it's tendency to reward plaintiffs with obscene settlements resulting from frivolous lawsuits.  




 Politics is won by the people who show up. 




 Their social media presence isn't what matters.

In fact, it really is a joke.

What matters is that Bloomberg has effectively unlimited resources to put boots on the ground to gather signatures, and then back that up with major ad buys on radio, television, and the Internet.

The problem is compounded by the fact that he's doing all of this in multiple states and none of the pro gun groups have the resources to meaningfully counter his strategy.

Money buys low information voters. 




 If he gets elected, he'll do exactly what the party bosses tell him to do, and he'll do it with a smile because he fully knows that it would have been impossible to win the presidency without the support of the party.

The Democratic party hates the notion of private gun ownership, and they hate gun owners. When push comes to shove, even an ardently pro-gun Democrat will toe the party line if it allows him to keep or advance his position. 




 If this is a civil case, I expect Bushmaster will settle this out of court.

If it goes to trial I would fully expect them to lose. 




 These kinds of stories need to get crossposted to Nevada-related web venues so they get some idea of what they're in for. 




 Replace the honking with creepy hissing.

Having geese hiss at you is unsettling. 




 Do you think that's money you're spending? 




 You think that, but in Heck, the only flavor of jelly is orange marmalade.  




 This sounds like the setup to an episode of Better Off Ted. 




 Hey, if you think 3 years in federal prison is a reasonable punishment for a completely victimless crime, feel free to believe that.

But it makes you a horrible person.

But we already know that about you, don't we? 




 I'm not a member of the Tea party, and you haven't yet made a convincing argument for why an African American single mother of two should have to spend three years in prison.

You really suck at making convincing arguments, don't you? 




 Its already part of the law as Ms. Allen was placed into the diversionary program after a public outcry was raised. 

Protip: actually reading the linked article is one way to avoid looking like an imbecile, which, in case you're not aware, you are.  




 We've already established that most people are in favor of incorporating and/or exercising discretion in cases like this. 

Continually repeating the same thing over and over like a parrot isn't a tactic that's clearly not convincing anyone. 

Perhaps, and this is just a thought, perhaps you should try using a different approach if your want to actually convince me that you're right. 

Of course, you won't, and will continue to repeat stupid things that are easily shown to be fallacious.  




 They're narcissists, pure and simple. 




 Nice try.

I'm simply pointing out the racist outcome of a law you support.

I'll also note that you've completely failed to articulate why throwing Shaneen Allen in prison is in the best interest of society or safety.

All you've done in this entire thread is make a fallacious appeal to popularity (what's hilarious is that you can't even make that claim, as Ms. Allen was put into a diversion program AFTER a massive public outcry at the injustice of imprisoning her.)

But, hey, you're the one who's already voiced support for making it a felony to run a stop sign on an empty road.

In short, you're a dimwit, and not even your fellow graboid lunatics have tried to make the case that she should be convicted of a felony, because anyone with the least bit of tolerance or empathy can see the injustice of the situation.

Please, continue, as I do so love sharing your posts with others as an example of the pathological narcissism inherent to anti-gun culture. 




 Send him this article

http://www.wired.com/2013/02/ar-15/all/ 




 That isn't the issue. The issue at hand is that you're in favor of imprisoning African American single mothers. I have to wonder if you're even aware of your privilege or just a racist, but that's par for the course when it comes to people who hate civil rights. 




 Jesus Christ! What a blast from the past!

You've clearly been stewing about this for some time.

I had completely forgotten about this discussion.

Maybe next time you argue in favor of throwing African American single mothers in prison, you could manage to be a little more prompt with your responses. 




 The thing that surprised me about the movie wasn't that it was a hagiography for Walt Disney (they show him doing and saying some things that come across as a bit unethical) but that the film makers opted to turn the movie into a bit of a redemption story about Travers, when in fact she was, by all accounts, evidently a terrible person.

 They actually foreshadowed that he wasn't a drug addict, but very strong-willed with that scene where he pulls out two cigarettes that he's had stashed away for years.

Other than that, I agree that it was a pretty terrible film. 




 And even then, the commentary was about as nuanced as the views of that one kid in high school.

You know, the one from an upper middle class background who read The Communist Manifesto, and then promptly failed to grow a beard.

They would be completely incapable of making a holiday greeting even 1% as awesome as this.  




 Thank you for proving my point.

It's hilarious how you're willing to contort yourself into all sorts of laughable positions in order to avoid defending a law and punishment you know to be morally untenable.

Please, continue, as I quite enjoy sharing your posts on other forums with people who find you as hilarious as I do.

Once again, please explain why you think an African American mother of two who's committed a completely victimless crime should have to lose her children, spend 3 years in prison, and live the rest of her life with a felony conviction all because of your distorted view of the racist founders and a republican governor?

Thanks.
 




 No, the law in New Jersey allows for leniency in a diversion program, but the prosecutor chose to throw the book at someone who had harmed no one.

You said nothing in support of the diversion program, in essence endorsing throwing the book at her. 

Then, in order to demonstrate what a pathetic coward you are, you won't actually defend your position, rather choosing to hide behind a claim that clearly the law is just because the citizens of New Jersey want such a law (which manages to be a fallacious appeal to popularity, as well as a complete non-sequitur).

Either defend your position for imprisoning her, or admit that you are wrong. 

What the people of New Jersey think isn't the issue here, as what we're concerned with is why YOU support throwing a mother of two in prison for a victimless crime.  




 That's hilarious. 

You're so wrapped up in being offended that you actually think that having your sensibilities offended makes you a victim. 

Of course, you'll deny this because it's perfectly absurd, but your inability to actually produce a victim only managed to highlight your stupidity. 

As for running stop signs, I have to ask: do you believe that a felony conviction and three years in prison is an acceptable punishment?  




 So you are admitting that you're perfectly OK with locking up a mother of two for committing a victimless crime. 

 

Much empathy.

Such tolerance. 

Wow.  




 Not sure. I was under the impression that it was just the raw NICS numbers, and that they didn't differentiate then based on the reason for conducting the check.  




 So you would have her thrown in jail for committing a completely victimless crime?

And here I thought liberals were supposed to be tolerant.

I guess the marketing is better than the product in your case. 




 Also, if you purchase more than one gun at the same time, they only run one background check.

However, NICS checks get run for reasons other than gun purchases, such as when people get concealed carry permits, and at least one state, Kentucky, runs NICS checks on all CCW holders once a month, which is going to skew the numbers.

As you point out, it's not a one-to-one relationship, but it's an enormous freaking indicator of just how popular guns are. 




 Wow! Phenomenal photograph!  









 Gun control is the solution to the problems it causes.

It's the perfect example of a self-licking ice-cream cone. 









 Yeah, in real life, balance is applied to silencers by making them expensive and throwing up a bunch of bureaucratic hoops to jump through in order to get one.

It's a little-known fact that Battlefield 4 had this in the beta, but the "filling out ATF Form 4, getting an FBI background check, and waiting 9 months" portion of the game turned out to be hugely unpopular, so in the interest of keeping the game fun, they just gave suppressors an accuracy penalty instead. 




 That's very odd.

I do have to say, thanks for writing this article. Seeing something like suppressors demystified in a venue geared toward techies is a very positive thing.

I do have one quibble with this bit, though:

Suppressing a rifle while hunting is one thing; the use cases for suppressing pistols are a lot narrower. "That's the hardest one," Schauble said when we asked why anyone would need or want a suppressed pistol. 

Frankly, I think it's pretty easy to justify suppressing a pistol. If you've ever trained someone who's never shot a handgun before, one of the hardest things for a new shooter to overcome is their sensitivity to the noise and recoil of the gun when it fires.

Here you are, telling them to concentrate on the front sight, and taking the time to coach them on proper trigger pull, and for them to be able to do that, they have to overcome the instinctive human reaction to be surprised and a little scared when it results in a very loud noise and movement.

Coaching a completely new shooter is made much, much easier with the addition of a suppressor to a handgun because it removes the most anxiety-inducing part of the whole experience.

It also makes it a lot easier to coach the new shooter, because you don't have to wear hearing protection, which can make it harder for the new shooter to understand.

Again, thanks for this article, overall, it's a really excellent introduction to the topic of suppressors for an audience who may have never seen them outside of the movies or video games. 




 I post stuff here with the hope that it will be shared by others who find it to be relevant, so, please feel free to share the link far and wide!

 My guess is that if the signatures turn out to be mostly valid, they'll allow the ballot initiative to move forward despite minor paperwork irregularities. 

That said, I'm glad to see them holding Bloomberg's feet to the fire in any way possible.  









 But they didn't pass those laws! 

See! The antis are "reasonable" and willing to "compromise"! 









 Exactly this.

Even if the journalism is unbiased (which it isn't) the fact that they're beating a continuous drum about it only manages to act as a way to keep gun control in front of the public, and scared. 




 Speaking as someone who's made an on-the-clock cold bore shot on a target at 890 yards with a borrowed rifle*, I'm going to simply ignore your attempts to insult my marksmanship abilities.

That said, let's pretend for a moment that you're right, and "no one needs more than 12 rounds."

Please explain how your perceived "need" makes it perfectly justifiable to arrest, charge, try, convict, and imprison someone for having a plastic box that you consider to be unnecessary?

Furthermore, please explain how your support for throwing people in prison for owning a plastic box doesn't qualify you as a supporter of gun control.

Thanks.

*Not trying to brag. That's only one thing on a list of many that I've been told is "impressive" that I simply consider above-average.
 




 Nope. Most AR mag manufacturers, as well as the makers of almost all other magazines for pretty much every make, model, and caliber of gun don't stamp dates on their magazines.

As written, the law is completely unenforceable, a fact that was ignored by the legislature, despite being pointed multiple times by nearly every Sheriff in the state, many thousands of voters, and anyone else who wasn't being paid off by Michael Bloomberg's cronies. 




 You're the one that employed antagonistic rhetoric and caps in your post. Clearly he upset you. There's no harm in owning the fact that you're emotionally upset.

As for your opinion on gun control, your stated support for Magpul's leaving the state, as well as support for the magazine law really says all that needs to be said with regards to your stance on gun control.

There's nothing wrong with being anti-gun. If that's what you believe, at least have the decency and courage to own the position and state your support for those laws unequivocally, instead of trying to hide behind vague wording and innuendo. 




 If you want reduced recoil and better control with an AR10, there are several things you can do, and here they are in escalating order of complexity:

1.) Get a better compensator. Look at something like the Bennie Coolie Comp or JP Tank Brake.

2.) Install an adjustable gas block. This will allow you to dial in the right amount of gas that gets siphoned off to cycle the gun.

3.) Install a low-mass bolt carrier, like the one offered by JP.

4.) Install a buffer with tungsten weights.

5.) Shoot light-weight bullets. 135 grain bullets will go a long way to taming recoil on an AR10.

6.) Employ proper shooting technique.

7.) Get in the gym and lift weights. Seriously.

Despite the fact that they look like an AR15, AR10s are a completely different animal. In a stock configuration, they can and will have a much heavier recoil impulse than a stock AR15.

However, if you put the time and effort in to tailoring the rifle's operating system and ammunition, you can reduce recoil by a tremendous amount.

A few months ago, I had the opportunity to shoot an AR10 that had most of the modifications done that I've listed above, and it was almost as low-recoil as shooting a JP CTR-2.

Double taps were extremely easy, and the rifle handled very, very well. So AR10 recoil can be tamed, it just takes effort. 




 If that's the case, why did Magpul bother to put effort into fighting the passage of the laws in the first place? 




  The company had decided by December 2012 to build a state-of-the-art facility in Broomfield, about 15 miles from Erie, but pivoted after the passage of Democratic gun-control bills in March.

TIL Broomfield is in Wyoming and/or Texas. 




 Regardless of whether or not they're a necessity, supporting a position that would imprison people for owning firearms and/or firearms accessories is morally untenable. 




 Typical behavior for a gun control fan. But for name-calling or deliberate misrepresentation, you'd have nothing to say on the topic at all! 




 Magazines don't actually have the date stamped on them. Magpul stamps the date on theirs for QC reasons, but there are probably about a dozen other makers of *just* AR magazines who don't stamp dates or serial numbers on them. 




 Nothing in my post would indicate that I feel personally attacked.

In fact, judging by your angry attack on /u/Gun_Defender, if anyone here is lashing out emotionally, it's you.

Frankly, I'm amused by your perceived need to back-pedal away from your support of gun control. 




 Ah, yes. Here we have a perfect example of the mindset of the typical gun control fan.

Horrendously narcissistic, completely ignorant, and utterly angry that any person (or in this case, company) would dare to contradict them. 




 They did try to work within the legal system and were completely, totally, rebuffed by a legislature who was completely uninterested in facing the facts of how unenforceable and idiotic their law was, on top of how damaging it was to a solid company with hundreds of employees. 




 They put a poorly-worded, hastily drafted manufacturers' exception in at the last minute, but the Magpul reps said that it still put a massive liability on them, and that the law still would have made it illegal for them to do things like transfer magazines to freight drivers to move them out of state. 

 




 The interesting implication here is that Magpul has been operating in violation of the Colorado magazine ban on a literally industrial scale since the ban was passed.

 How dare he possess a plastic box that holds more than an arbitrary number of objects without first getting permission from the state! 

Throw the fucking book at him!  




 I keep forgetting that legislation shouldn't be based on things like efficacy, enforceability, equal respect for civil rights or reason. 

You're right, laws should be based on feels.  




 For the cost of 1 AR15, you can mill out as many 80% receivers as you like.

There's a difference. 




 If they actually cared about stopping criminals, they'd work to implement a simple and inclusive plan that would enlist gun owners in *helping* to prevent criminals getting their hands on guns, rather than treating all gun owners like criminals.

For example, most states mark the driver's licenses for people who are under 21 so it's easy for anyone to ascertain at a glance whether they are of legal drinking age.

Implementing a similar plan where everyone's ID is marked so that someone who is  looking to sell a gun can learn whether the person they're dealing with is a prohibited person or not would be far more effective, cheaper, and easier to implement than the so-called "universal background check" schemes that have been pushed by the likes of Bloomberg.

Unfortunately, this isn't actually about preventing criminals from getting guns. If it were, they would actually bother to prosecute the thousands of NICS checks that come back negative on convicted and violent prohibited persons every year. 




 So, I have a few concerns about the legislation you evidently support.

Does it address the problems that were seen in the Colorado and Washington laws?

You know, like how those laws would make you a criminal for loaning a rifle to a friend for a hunting trip or competition?

Does it fix the prices on background checks, thereby ensuring that no gun dealers will actually be interested in conducting background checks on any transfers except for the ones they conduct on the guns they sell in their shops?

Does it address issues like what happened in Colorado last year when it turned out flood victims who had lost their homes were inadvertently criminalized for transferring their gun collections to friends for safe keeping?

Does it make it a crime to let someone handle a firearm without a background check at a venue other than on a gun range operated by a for-profit enterprise, thereby criminalizing you if you loan your gun to a buddy at a range operated by a non-profit (as most shooting clubs are), on public land, or on private property?

Does the proposed legislation inadvertently discriminate against couples in non-traditional marriages by prohibiting transfer of a firearm without a background check between gay or lesbian couples, while allowing the same sorts of transfers to occur between heterosexual couples?

Does the legislation you support include common-sense exemptions on transfers, for example, those who've already successfully passed a background check in order to acquire a concealed carry permit?

In short, would you care to share the text of the actual legislation that you feel so strongly about?


Thanks.

Because, frankly, you're not posting anything that hasn't been debunked a million times before, and frankly, its boring.

What's it like being an earnest troll? 




 Guns in the hands of criminals facilitate murder and other crimes. Guns in the hands of responsible people facilitate suicide. Guns in the hands of irresponsible people facilitate accidents. Even self-defense killing is far from desirable. Even responsible gun owners put others at risk when they fire in self defense.

And yet, guns are fired hundreds of millions of times more per year for reasons that are completely legal than they are used for mayhem.

Of course, you also don't want to breach the fact that they're used for self-defense and defense of others around 1-2million times per year.

Furthermore, in your zeal to hate on gun owners, and your wish to disarm them, you demonstrate that everyone who posts here, who's ever used a firearm in self defense, is someone who you wish was dead.

Yeah you don't like me, I remember. I'm just going to start trimming the inane rants out of the quoted text when I respond.

For some, it's easier to pretend to ignore the truth when it stings them. 




 Of course it does. But you're neglecting the net effect of guns, which is to make everyone less safe.

Except they don't. What's it like being wrong *all* the time? Does your mother dress you in the morning?

Since I am not making an argument based on the contents of any instruction manuals, this isn't really a good point.

It's perfectly relevant, because you don't even understand the most basic facts of a subject you claim to be an expert on, and your lack of understanding, real-world experience, or even an open-minded willingness to engage in a forthright dialogue (as opposed to pathetically sub-par trolling) only manages to underscore the fact that you are clearly as ignorant as you are opinionated.

Frankly, I'm a bit embarrassed for you. 




 The ability to use a gun in self-defense does make one safer, and frankly, I don't think that someone who's never taken the time to actually read the instruction manual that comes with a firearm are qualified in any way, shape, or form to pontificate on who should, or should not, be prohibited from owning a gun. 




 I think it would be better to get out in front of it.

Draft the legislation, get it passed and put in the books, so that way when the Bloomberg money machine rolls into town to try to pass more onerous restrictions regarding background checks, the response will be a collective shrug followed by a "we already passed a background check gun bill last year."

 




 Once upon a time, I was in a pawn shop where an old guy was trying to buy a gun.

I over heard the conversation between him and the clerk, and it turned out he had marked down that he'd been dishonorably discharged from the military, and had marked that down on the 4473.

The clerk told him he couldn't sell him a gun, and sent him on his way.

Do I think that this particular sad old man should have been sent to prison?

Of course not.

But what's the point of having a law on the books, especially a law that would let you catch criminals with violent histories dead to rights for trying to acquire the means to commit violence if no one is going to throw them in prison for it?

The lack of enforcement on that front is an utter embarrassment to the entire structure of the NICS system, and no one wants to point this out (or, at least here, pedants want to dick around with semantic word games.) 




 Now you're shifting goal posts.

You started out pointing out that 1/3 of NICS checks that fail do so for erroneous reasons.

Of course no one this side of Michael Bloomberg would advocate throwing those people in jail.

Furthermore, studies have shown that the prosecution rates for NICS violations are very, very minimal, and that includes prohibited persons who've committed violent felonies.

If the powers that be were half as concerned about stopping criminals from getting guns as they claim, that would be a really easy way to stop it right there.
 




 Note my first sentence:

Make sure that *criminals* are prosecuted if they fail a NICs check. 




 Yes, it does. If a majority of people believe that having a gun makes them safer, then they are much less likely to support restrictions on firearms ownership.

If this headline is true, then it makes it just that much harder for gun control supporters to pass restrictive legislation. 




 The kind of people who get a degree in elementary education.  




 There are entire sub reddits devoted to it.  




 One of the stupid things about the current system is that lying on the forms, or being a prohibited person who tries to but a gun is a federal crime, yet those crimes are rarely prosecuted. 

There's no point in even having the current NICS system if you're not going to even bother arresting convicted felons for trying to buy a gun.  




 Make sure that criminals are prosecuted if they fail a NICs check. 

Then, push for a law to mark drivers licenses and other forms of ID so that you can tell, at a glance, whether a prospective buyer is a prohibited person or not. 

There would be almost zero cost associated with implementing this plan, and the only reason to oppose it would be because you're an authoritarian.  














 One of the best comedy call backs of all time was when they recreated this scene in Arrested Development. 

 




 That line of thinking is possibly the most idiotic thing I've read in the last week. 

Religious fundamentalists are truly an albatross around the neck of the republican party.  




 Merrifield's victory was completely unsurprising given how jerrmandered that district is in favor of the Democratic party. 

On top of that, Herpin isn't exactly a political genius.  




 Every sperm is sacred! 




 Wow. They kept people occupied for the whole 30 seconds it took to read the proposal and vote it down.

Even by pro life protester standards that's some truly idiotic thinking. 




 Nope. 




 I'm sorry, but a system based on evaluating signatures is a laughably terrible way to "secure" your voting system.

Even if there is no fraud, the system is functionally broken because the signature verification method is woefully inadequate for verifying ballots cast by people other than the intended recipient.

Nor does it stop ballot harvesting or other, more brazen methods, like false registration.

But, hey, let the downvotes commence because voicing legitimate concerns about a problem with Team Blue policies mean you're an evil Koch brother zombie tea party racist. 




 I guess I'd be upset if I lacked basic reading comprehension skills, too.

At least you have the word "moustachio" in your name, which is mildly amusing. 




 Like a free ride when you've already paid, hoser.  




 That's exactly why I posted it.

Granted, I should have been more explicitin stating the connection in the title, and if the mode feel the need to remove the post, I'm not going to get butthurt about it. 




 7.62x39 is a poor choice for any kind of long range as its not a very flat shooting cartridge. 

Get a .223 and it will cover all your bases except for deer hunting. 

If you absolutely must have a gun in a legal deer cartridge, get one in 300 blackout, but realize it's not going to be a great cartridge at longer range, and will cost more than  .223. 




 You can't read it?

I thought even the most basic of simpletons could grasp plain English.  




 Do you need me to explain how discussion threads work, or should we just assume you're baked, and will remember how they work in the morning? 




 There very likely would be market demand for fuel efficient cars if oil industry subsidies didn't keep gas prices artificially low.  




 This is such a bummer.

 I think it's hilarious that my quote from The Simpsons garnered a bunch of downvotes.
