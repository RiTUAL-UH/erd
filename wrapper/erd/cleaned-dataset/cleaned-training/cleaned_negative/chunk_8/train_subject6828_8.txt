 And this is the BP station over Duna...who left the fuel line open? 




 "I'm not the Zodiac, and if I was I certainly wouldn't tell you." 




 This movie made me feel dirty. 




 My guess is Frank always  intended  to have Mendoza as his VP. Run a bipartisan ticket. America Works  is kinda conservative anyways. Besides, that sounds  like  something  Frank  would do. 




 Could you  not, Donna? 




 I miss me some Michael Ironside. 




 1) craigslist/free  for the bed.


2) look up abandoned buildings in your area, find one that's cement and where you can control the lighting.

 If you haven't seen it, there's a scene in BBC Sherlock S03E03 where someone gets shot that takes about five minutes to cover ten seconds. 




 Nice and creepy. Good stuff.

 Damn it, Nic! 




 Technically, we it happened 12 billion years ago, so we might've missed it already. 




 We only ever see two bodies, the one in the morgue and at tge the end. The one at the end could have been the first copy and the one you see drowning is the lookalike.  




 Right but that could have been the only time he used it completely.  The other times were just theatrics.  




 I like this [interpretation](http://www.cracked.com/blog/4-christopher-nolan-movies-no-other-director-could-have-made/).

 I just figured the raptors swam to shore and a teenage Chris Pratt found them injured, nursed them back to health.

 "And uh...Paul Allen! I killed [Paul Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OARf8dNLBc) with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's kitchen." 




 All this guy's [stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jUlbgcYTQY) is pretty neat. 




 That was cool.  




 Stick with it. If you like doing it, then it's worth it soley on that merit. When I was younger I would record gameplay and cut it and add music. This was something I did just for me, but some folks liked it.

It's not perfect but I didn't do it to get anywhere. Sometimes things are just what they are and that's okay. Try to be happy with what you make. 




 Stoked. 




 I actually Lol'ed. 




 Okay, now read up on this stuff. Look for online testimonials of the day in the life of these jobs. Research. Also, remember on smaller films you could be more than one of these. 




 oh, no. 




 Read the whole page, find a top 5 of what you'd like to do.

 I understand your point, I've been there but that is definitely plan B. I've gone over it in my head and decided that I will die happy if I can make a steady living doing SOMETHING in film. Even if I were an extra, the fact that I'd be contributing to what, to me, is a sacred form of storytelling would be enough to keep me happy. 


But I want to tell stories and help others tell theirs, I want to do for others what great directors do to me. Grab an audience out of their chairs and make them terrified of going to the beach, or believe in true love or time travel. If I could do that Once, I have achieved my dream.

So? are you an idea person or are you a support? Someone who creates an idea in their head or someone who helps realise it in front of a camera? 

You know you love movies, that is 90% of the work done. You never have to work a job you hate because you're unsure of your passion. 


What are you good at that you want to do alot of professionally and how can that be involved in filmmaking? 




 Check this trailer out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hYlB38asDY




Note the music and the cuts. Then note the changes in musical tone, the music ends when the action/trauma begins then once that's over the score swells up around 0m50s. Study this trailer for a bit. Notice how the volume changes and you can hear the actor, oftentimes the music remains but very much in the background. 




 :-( 




 The lord of the rings: The Two towers. I would love to have seen the battle of helm's deep from the perspective of Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn. 




 Brrrrrrraaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!! 




 GTA V-First person mode. 




 This shot has many cuts, sped up action, blurs are added to create a sense of super speed, the main character is kept in the center of the shot most of the time. And lots of choreography BUT with this many cuts this fight probably took more than a day to shoot. 




 You should sit yourself down and think for a hard long while.



This is the only life you're gonna get. No retries, no do overs. What do you want to dive into and commit to for the rest of your life. When you're older and no longer able to work because senility is creeping in you're going to need to KNOW you didn't waste your shot. Don't expect someone to suggest something and you do it because it sounds like fun. It needs to burn inside your chest, fill you with exhilaration just the thought of heading towards that goal. Passion is painful, but it's such a beautiful pain because you know it's what you were meant to do. Why you are here.

 Just found this subreddit and since the last post was more than a week ago I was wondering what projects you guys are working on. 




 FIRE! 




 Something that MADE me lose faith in humanity is the mainstream media. Every story has to do with some massacre or execution. If it's not then it's a critique of how the world is dealing with it. And oh my god, shut the fuck up about the planes. 


After too much, I had to just turn it off and go outside.  It's a beautiful day.  




 Not a Hitler. 




 Do you set the toilet paper towards you or away? 




 A moment of clarity.


No one should go through life doing what they don't want to do, you should sit down with a clear mind and allow yourself to fantasize how your life could be better, then go out and work to achieve that.


Note: This does not apply to any Hitlers reading this. 




 This is a stupid question.
