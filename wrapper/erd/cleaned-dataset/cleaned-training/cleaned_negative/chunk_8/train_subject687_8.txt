 Holy $hit D: 




 I have really discussed very personal information with someone by PMs 




 OH GOD, MR SKELTAL SAVE US!

 thank 




 mr skeltal 




 The Vietnam Madonna from 973ehtnamuh973. 




 "Bouncing the cow's stomach-trampoline, eh?" 




 They would get home drunk at 4 AM and just throw up on the street. 




 Thanx mr skeltal 




 doot  




 Yeah, that was terrible... I got banned from /r/rant for saying "doot doot" 




 doot 




 I have no idea... lol. It's so mystic.... 




 I'm too young to die D: 




 **I take that back.** 




 I agree. He should make a book so we can buy it and he can get rich ;) 




 It was an accident... he was aiming for the helicopter... 




 Why, my friend? Mr.Skeltal is a good guy. 









 Out of curiosity, what would you say to u/20141220? 




 Why!?


Ok, so in the dream I was able to summon a cow(with horns) that came out of the floor(breaking the floor). It didn't actually hurt people, but it did cause a bit of destruction. So I summoned it during school, and it came out of the floor but just then my physics teacher came! A huge pool of water just appeared out of nowhere(about 30 feet deep) and my physics teacher wrestled the cow to death(he killed the cow in the pool). WTF!? I know my physics teacher isn't capable of doing that in real life! He's a good guy! Whyyy oh **whyyyyyyy!!??**


EDIT: Also whenever the cow appeared, classic country music started playing.

 U 














 I know... bestiality is a big no-no. 




 I found it in new york. 




 It wasn't my fault. 




 Did I do anything wrong? D: 




 {:'-D 




 I don't understand D: Calcium is simply what bones are made of D:, 




 Are ye referring ta my post about the white mountain or the calcium comment? 




 I don't know D: 




 Interesting.... thanks  for explaining :) 




 One might even go as far as calling them "gods" 




 So technically both are the same website? 




 Oh yes, lots of calcium... 




 Oh God! {:'-D 




 Thanks for the article. 




 I'm just curious... It's about as big (in span) as a quarter... is that still small? I heard it was bigger... but about how old could it be?

EDIT: HOLY COW {:'-D it **is** a brown recluse! Identified! 




 D: That's terrible! I can't imagine losing mine! 









 Oh and then there was this very creepy satanic-like girl who never got in trouble for her wrong actions/words. 




 Freakin' elementary school... so foolish. You literally got in trouble just for making up a word, sneezing loud, walking a bit to fast, going through the left door instead of the right, etc. 




 It's quite possible that no easily-available decoder/encoder can help us. Though it looks like base64, it might be something else and the decoder might be very hard to find. 




 Wow, these are very great possibilities! 




 The first website is very similar to eht namuh.... why might that be? 




 Hey, it really was nice talking to you. It's kinda getting late though and I got school tomorrow, so I'm going to sleep for now. Goodnight babe and I'll be thinking about you! I'll talk to you again tomorrow, my princess! *kisses goodnight passionately*

 If the college-board dares to do that.... students should all boycott and refuse to take it.  




 Solution: /r/NoMoreSAT

p.s. please cross-post that article to the subreddit.... it is a great article. 




 Foolish college-board. They expect perfection from students, yet they mess up foolishly in their own idiotic nonsense. It truly is not fair for students who got less time and this is upsetting, truly upsetting.
