 Real short, cuz I'm so infatuated with the idea of holding a lot of liquid fuel in the FAT wings. I wish there were a separate oxidizer tank that you could add to offset that a little bit 




 Sometimes I feel like it isn't KSP if everything works like it's supposed to 




 Rapiers for sure, six of em. I finally learned that if you get up to about 12km and really start hauling ass with an air breathing engine you can get into orbit with a lot less rocket fuel 




 First successful SSTO scanner spaceplane, stock parts. Fuel capacity alterations to come. Any suggestions? Similar builds? 









 So down 




 An object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. The primary forces that would affect you on earth, gravity and drag due to atmosphere, are greatly diminished and not present, respectively, in orbit.
