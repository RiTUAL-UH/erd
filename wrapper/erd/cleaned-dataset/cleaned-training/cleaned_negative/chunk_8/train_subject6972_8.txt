 That day was my father's birthday, being from Costa Rica, he didn't care at all of the NFL playoffs. So, he wanted to go to the movies, we saw The Hobbit. 
Watched the first half of the game before the movie and thought "ok, I think it's better if I stop watching". Couldn't believe the score when I came out of the room  




 Love it. Next you have to do an eye tracker graph
