 Doesn't the article's author have a point? After all, Clark did run for a time as a Democratic presidential candidate, and was even backed by Michael Moore.

I guess the country dodged a bullet on that one, huh? 




 Why all of the deletions? 




 I expected that the US would wait at least a few months after the agreement was done before our war-loving government continued their bullying and threats.

Guess I was wrong... 




 * Pay no attention to global warming!
* Pay no attention to our house-of-cards economy!
* Pay no attention to the gap between the rich and poor!
* Pay no attention to the US fighting wars across the planet!
* Pay no attention to gov't spying, racism or our eroding civil liberties!
* Pay no attention to the man behind the ~~mirror~~ curtain!

Instead, pay attention to the [demagogue](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demagogue) disrespecting the war criminal!

Edit: Above typo. 




  the hideously unethical things they do are "legal".

I think it's worse than that in many cases. Today the government doesn't even pretend to follow the law -- except when it does (and then brags about following the law for PR purposes).

For example, Obama expects *praise* because he admitted what everyone already knew, that the US tortured "some folks". But did he follow the law and actually prosecute the torturers? No, the political coward refuses to enforce the law and instead protects and shields publicly-admitted torturers. One could give many other examples.

If we want to be honest, we simply are no longer a country that adheres to either the Constitution or the much-heralded "rule of law".

 "They tell you 'you are from al-Qaeda', and when you say 'no' they give the [electric] current to your feet...As you keep saying 'no' this goes on for two or three hours." -- German citizen Murat Kurnaz reporting on his 4 years of torture by the US in Gitmo. He was later released as innocent. 




  Okay, but that's most American wars since WWII,

Most?! Other than Korea (which we refuse to officially end) and the 1991 Gulf War which both had UN authorizations, I don't recall *any* US wars where we were attacked by another country since that time. Thus, except for those two exceptions, they're *all* wars of aggression.

That's the job of our military -- to attack other countries and subjugate them to our empire, and to seize markets and complete corporate conquests. And that's been the US military's job for a long, long time.

 Trump is still a giant...

You'll have no argument from me there. He's literally a [demagogue](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demagogue).

 "I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class thug for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism." -- USMC Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, winner of 2 Congressional Medals of Honor. 




  Imagine the scientific progress that could have been made if a year of iraq funding was given to scientists.

Scientific progress is a lower priority. Global warming threatens all of humanity!

It's estimated we will spend about $6 *trillion* on the Iraq and Afghan wars. Just think of how many jobs that would have created if we instead had spent that money on reworking our energy sector away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy...

But no, our country is addicted to war. 




 It's not about how much, it's about *who* *benefits* and what new markets on earth wars gains the US empire.

 "I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class thug for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism." -- USMC Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, winner of 2 Congressional Medals of Honor. 














 What a bogus false choice -- ISIS or the US-backed dictator.

Egyptians voted in a democratic government until the US-backed/armed/trained/funded Egyptian military overthrew it in a coup d'etat and followed the coup up with murdering hundreds of supporters of the elected government -- all with the Obama administration supplying the Egyptian military with weapons and cash the whole time.

Did we learn *nothing* from our overthrowing the democratic Iranian government in 1953?!

There are *many* valid reasons why the people of the world [see the US as the #1 threat to world peace](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/02/greatest-threat-world-peace-country_n_4531824.html). 









 If Bernie's point is only that if police murder and/or harass/arrest an equivalent number of white people to balance out the racial equation, he's missing the point.

We need *radical* solutions to the problem of our eroding civil liberties, and the nationwide epidemic of police brutality and murders.

 "A policeman's job is only easy in a police state." -- Orson Welles. 




 Don't worry, corporate food labs are working hard to create some tasty flavors.

Soon we'll be eating used cardboard and will be raving about how good it tastes! Ain't technology inherently wonderful?! 




 That's one of the few smart things Trump did.

Have we forgotten that the entire US war on Vietnam was an immoral war of aggression based on cold, calculated lies? 




 When are we going to get over this definition of "terrorism".

Terrorism is simply the lowest form of warfare, slightly above economic warfare and below guerrilla warfare. Many admirable movements over history have first started out with terrorism to push toward their objectives.

Today the US and western corporate mass media has us indoctrinated that all terrorism is a form of evil, all while ignoring terrorism that the US/west uses.

I'm sure the Kurds and every other group that uses "terrorism" would *love* to wage war using M-1 tanks and bombing their enemies with F-16s, cruise missiles and drones. But they don't have those weapons, so they use what they have.

As the old saying goes, "War is just terrorism but with a bigger budget." 




 When the location of your chosen profession means you live in a sewer of corruption, it should not be surprising that you sometimes act like a rat.

Sanders was a much more admirable politician when he was in Vermont. 




 Does anyone know where these winning students came from?

Are they from some public school with a great math program? From a private school? An "all star team" of young geniuses from above-average-income families who put a huge emphasis on math?

While this is "nice," the answer to the above makes all the difference in the world.

 "Raising test scores through such test preparation is like claiming you have raised the temperature of the room when all you have done is light a match under the thermometer." -- Stephen Krashen 









 Isn't that true of when candidates talk about *anything?*

The corporate mass media doesn't analyze the "election" focusing on charisma, soundbites and personality, and the horse race of who is raising the most money for nothing.

 "All the props of a democracy remain intact - elections, legislatures, media - but they predominantly function at the service of the oligarchy."  Richard Wolff 




 But unfortunately, *both* of their views of the future mean more American militarism, wars, trampling of civil liberties, surveillance/police-state and pro-corporate policies and general capitalist corruption.

Ask yourself this: Will *either* of these candidates actually do anything to end the American empire and our oligarchical rule? 




  So, if these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they are disloyal to the United States, as a matter of principle fine. It's their right and it's our right and obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.

And the "duration" of the so-called "war on terror" is forever, right?

Don't worry, it'll be some time before this happens. Clark, the nutcase who risked WWIII over his disobeyed 1990s order at Pristina airport in the former Yugoslavia, is simply "floating" the idea to test public reaction.

Just like the US military and police are "only" practicing this in Texas today.

We don't have to *really* worry until more talking heads start advocating this idea, or the US house-of-cards economy collapses. Right? 




  See I know that is bullshit 

A simple Wikipedia search [about McCain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain#Formative_years_and_education) says, "John McCain was born on August 29, 1936, at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, [to naval officer John S. McCain Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._McCain_Jr.) (19111981) and..."

So who is [John S. McCain Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._McCain_Jr.)? Wikipedia says about McCain Jr., "His father, John S. McCain, Sr., was also an admiral in the Navy and a naval aviator, and the two were the first father-son pair to achieve four-star rank.[1] His son, John S. McCain III, is a former naval aviator who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam..."

Thus, not only is John McCain the son of an Admiral, he comes from a line of Admirals, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, a true [fortunate son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbNnvPBokNs) who unfortunately was shot down over North Vietnam during the US' immoral war on that poor country.

Who says we don't have royalty in the US? 




 I'll ignore the article's far-right rant about "Masonic Jewish central bankers" and will just point out the facts:

We in the US have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons and ~1000 foreign military bases garrisoning most of the planet. Plus we've rigged the world's economy to force the world to accept the increasingly worthless US dollars that we endlessly print. We are an empire.

Greece doesn't enjoy any of these advantages.

 "I hate all forms of imperialism, and I consider the US brand to be the most loathsome and contemptible." -- Nelson Mandela. 




  the State Department today warned that it would be a provocation to send the Israeli military into the West Bank Palestinian town of Susya and bulldoze it to the ground, despite an Israeli High Court ruling approving that action.

The US government often bleats out these faux criticisms or warnings about blatantly illegal Israeli actions.

We see this every time Israel announces a new land theft and new housing settlement.

It's nothing more than moralistic PR propaganda by the US. Israel will ignore the US, and the US knows that Israel will not take the US seriously -- this is raw political theater.

 "If you are a young Muslim American and head off to the Middle East for a spell in a fundamentalist 'madrassa,' or religious school, Homeland Security will probably greet you at the airport when you return. But if you are an American Jew and you join hundreds of teenagers from Europe and Mexico for an eight-week training course run by the Israel Defense Forces, you can post your picture wearing an Israeli army uniform and holding an automatic weapon on MySpace." -- Journalist Chris Hedges. 




 Like the US, laws and democracy don't really matter in the UK.

Capitalists and the national security state have completely taken over the government.

 "As demonstrated in Russia and numerous other countries, when faced with a choice between democracy without capitalism or capitalism without democracy, Western elites unhesitatingly embrace the latter." -- Michael Parenti 




 One can demand *proof* about many things in history.

Where is the *proof* that the Nazis burned down the German Reichstag? Where is the *proof* that the US rigged the Gulf of Tonkin incident to start the Vietnam War? Where is the *proof* that Ronnie Reagan lied about the Iran-Contra Scandal or the invasion of Grenada?

In operations of political and intelligence skulduggery, professional intelligence agencies very, very rarely leave smoking guns lying around -- typically one has to come to conclusions on circumstantial evidence, histories of the various actors, constantly asking [cui bono](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cui+bono) and operating on raw common sense. 




 As a former professor, take my word for it: Almost any city that is a "college town" (i.e. where the city relies on college students and the students make up a significant part of the city population), will have reasonable police. (Remember, local police have lots of discretion when it comes to enforcing laws.)

The economics of the college/university and the flow of money will demand that.

Don't get me wrong, if you're an ass or if you're in an extreme situation, you'll be busted. But if you're "normal" a blind eye will be turned and lots of things will be ignored no matter what the state laws are. Additionally, even in situations where police are involved, the college/university has the ability to sweep many things under the rug and to make them disappear -- and they frequently do.

With that said, having been to Keene, NH and KSC many times, believe me: It's a college town. :) 




  wait, we're citing roosevelt now? lol ok. i mistook this for /r/socialism.

Yes, I thought FDR's definition of fascism was particularly apropos.

But if you have some sort of knee-jerk, mindless reaction against anyone that does not totally and completely agree with your own particular view of society, a reaction that requires ignoring anything that they say no matter how accurate or informed their thoughts might be, then I apologize for insulting your close-minded sensibilities. 

 "Democracy is the road to socialism." -- Karl Marx 




  Is it possible to be a stoner in NH?

WTF?! It's easily possible to be a stoner in any of the 50 states. Doubly easy if you're going to college.

But despite the rhetoric of NH having libertarian attitudes, in many ways NH is the conservative state of New England. Seriously.

If you're looking for liberal weed laws in northern New England, look first at Maine, or VT -- both are simply superior based on that criteria. 




 Interesting article about a serious problem.

But with that said, they really have to do a better job with the pictures.

Multiple shots of a gorgeous girl pouring seemingly clean water out of a clean plastic jug onto her fingers is *not* the way to motivate people that this is a serious pollution problem, even if there is some green plant in some of the pics.

PR spin is clearly not these researchers' forte. (I hope honesty is.) But still, they should whip out their microscopes and give some closeup pics of these beads, trying to make them as dangerous looking as possible.

It's sad that they should do this, but we live in a capitalist society of people raised on sensationalistic infortainment who have a split-second attention span. 




  All he had to do was read a piece of paper and he was going home, and no one would really have held it against him.

Trump's an ignoramus dick who logically did not want to fight in the immoral Vietnam War, granted, but let's be real.

A few inconvenient truths: McCain was the son of a US Navy Admiral -- there was no way he would ever have been let go by North Vietnam. McCain was forced to make a propaganda film for the North Vietnamese, but the Pentagon still has that film classified and it is not in circulation.

And the most controversial? Some POWs claim that McCain cooperated with the North Vietnamese (not surprising; under the circumstances *many* POWs cooperated) and that he was given special privileges and even trips to town because of his father's status and his cooperation.

See [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423112346/http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn04192008.html) or [that](http://www.counterpunch.org/2008/04/19/hero-john-mccain-as-phony-and-collaborator-what-really-happened-when-he-was-a-pow/) for more details. 




  Fascism never again!

Unless they're the stormtroopers in the overthrow of the legitimate government of Ukraine -- because in that case, US nationalism and western propaganda will kick in because, well, because that's what we're indoctrinated for.

And besides, the pre-coup Ukrainian government was corrupt, was friendly to Russia -- Russia! -- and we paid billions in Ukraine to fund dissidents, train young people about "democracy", and to buy friends that would protest on cue.

And isn't the word "fascist" so old-school? Today we prefer to call the fascists rightists, nationalists or even neo-liberals.

 "The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State itself. That, in its essence, is fascism - ownership of government by an individual, by a group or by any other controlling private power." -- US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 




 Exactly my point, Tibet does not apply. Modern China has always included Tibet as an autonomous region. For example, before WWII the US fully recognized that Tibet was part of China.

Only *after* the Chinese communist revolution in 1949 -- after we claimed to "lose" China, an imperialist phrase suggesting China was somehow ours to lose -- and the US started arming Tibetans and backing the Dali Lama, that the west started clamoring about Tibetan independence as a Cold War divide-and-conquer strategy to break up China. (Much in the same way the US backs Uyghur Muslim separatists today.) 




 I don't have a source handy, but a [simple search here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/search?q=libya+wikileaks) should turn up some interesting results. 




 The ruse idea is certainly correct. But [this author](http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/07/17/is-the-iran-nukes-deal-aimed-at-crushing-putin/) outlines quite a few other factors in the equation, and paints the overall US strategy.

Definitely worth reading and pondering. 




  no one in Washington would ever say, or even think, Our national identity is in flux, so we need an external enemy to keep it together.

Isn't that essentially what famous State Dept. strategist and US ambassador to the USSR George F. Kennan said decades before the 1997 article mentioned when Kennan said, "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."

Okay, Kennan was focused on the economy, but it's essentially the same idea as the Soviet strategist Georgi Arbatov when he said the USSR was going to do an "evil" thing to the US -- We are going to deprive you of an enemy.

Today this idea is widespread. The US government literally has to invent enemies to keep Americans united and to stop us from focusing on our deteriorating environment, economy and our *massive* gap between the rich and poor.

 "In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares." -- [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3755686.stm) documentary "[The Power of Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Power+of+Nightmares)"
