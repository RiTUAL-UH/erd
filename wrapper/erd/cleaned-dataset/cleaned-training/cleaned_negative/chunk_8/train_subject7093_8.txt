 He's trying to look like Jen, so
Kevin will start fucking him again.    




 Cute name for a Critter.  




 Beautiful, but he's wrong.   Everyone here has seen chaos mode used before in their lifetime.  Chaos setting is used when someone breaks into your house and you need to make a quick escape.  Movies will show someone grabbing 3 or 4 flammable aerosol cans and placing them in the microwave.   Next will hit the chaos button before fleeing the house.    What happens next is always chaotic from explosions and fires taking out your enemies.     




 Thats so cute
 




 Check out that conch  




 I thought this was r/pics.   I feel like some movie should have a scene filmed here.   




 20 fucking years.  Just think that little pet was so excited to played with on Christmas only to spend the next 20 Christmases in the dark basement.   
 




 Is your mom 61?  




 They are just bonding.  




 I drive a 2001 lumina.  Ya.   




 Instant poop came to my mind 




 Edex.

 Brad Pitt? 




 Honestly don't open it.   And save Ittttttok 




 I know!  We can't stop here show the rest.   Shit was getting hot!  




 Are you a pornstar? 




 The fish actually has a parasite.  The parasite worm infested the fish and now is controlling its body to swim in circles near the surface of the water.  By doing so it's hoping to become eaten by a bird and later pooped out so another fish can eat the birds poo.   Circle of life.  




 happy.

None of these soldiers had cases either.    




 50 shades of gray  




 That is the cutest little cow!  Look at them spots!

 You need a sling shot or something 




 I want facts, show me fossils!  *How do you know these were the first plants?  Because of these fossils?  We have no clue, don't show me stupid fossils!*

My wieners spooning.   




 Said Bill Cosby.  




 I would wear Patrick swayze mask from point break 




 Any of those should be fine.  I ran cheaper Gordon's and I live in MN.  Just make sure you buy all 4.  




 Your move, Curiosity  




 Same except mine was all black standing in the corner staring at me and all of a sudden it open up it's mouth which was the size of the body and before I could blink it was right in front my face.   That was the last one I had 




 They should at least make the leash out of a clear material.   




 I was gonna say... I feel sad for the people who didn't get to actually experience G4.   




 Bicycle  




 Bigger then wrestling  




 Luigi gets mansions.  It's haunted 




 Only took me two minutes to be all over my front page.  




 Feline foot fetish  




 Ah man I kept seeing the 1/6 and wishing Steven would just shut up or break his phone.   




 I always check eBay auctions.   I'll watch a couple to see if there's a consistency on bids/$.  I will also x-shop amazon and other online retailers.    Pretty easy to figure out a fair yet reasonable price.   

Edit:   Also as for selling in a lot of games or as singles it all depends.   Have a bunch of low title name games (sports games, repeats, ect) sell as a bundle.  
Have big ranking titles like (Final Fantasy III, Chrono Trigger, Mario RPG).   Sell separate.   Have sequel or trilogy titles?   Sell as a set. (Donkey Kong. DK 2, DK3) 

If you go eBay route, combine shipping with different auctions.    This will help your buyers and have them battle for certain games since they are committed on the shipping.   




 $2.00 for spidey/xmen 









 He probably seen some shit in his life.   




 Sorry homie.   The girl likes it  









 Sounds a little strange to say it but I like the name.  Will call it a garage.   




 No matter what it's a shiton of beer 




 Oh you 




 Question if anyone reads this.  
Do you think Marvel will release a new trailer or somewhat altered trailer for GOTG 2?  Second,  do they figure out who leaks this or does this just get brushed under the rug?   

p.s.  Marvel handled this in a perfect way.   Instantly release a true copy and accept fate.   




 I know a spunelli.    




 You're just suppose to stand and reflect.    




 Same plastic they made the snes out of  




 Where's the image from the kid holding the stick on the GoPro? 




 Nice trail for 4wheeling/snowmobile  




 Same with mine!
