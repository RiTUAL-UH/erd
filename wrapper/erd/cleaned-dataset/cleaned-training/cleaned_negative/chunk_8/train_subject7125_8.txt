 maybe he should pet it and ask it nicely ! 




 as long as we model it on one of the more successful existing systems around the world it could be a big improvement 




 if you never grew out of the 90s you will love it . i didn't and i do ! 






















































 the title is a bit overboard but i am intrigued by the book still 












































 how many practice rounds i wonder and how many pieces can he do like this or is it just a one-trick pony show ? 




 unfortunately this is nothing new and there is no easy fix except to hold currency abroad or hard assets 




 i love watching them squirm around what they claim is a tiny percentage of people we should not care about 










































































 what shall we do with a drunken sailor ? 


































 i'm no chicken but i'm pretty sure that's unidan 




 oh how quickly the tables have turned 




 *at the same time !* 



















 most people who are homeless are not homeless by choice . poverty and mental illness are key drivers  
























 i can imagine it doing that if not now then someday , but then who gets the liability for the decision if people are still injured just fewer than would have been otherwise ? could be very problematic 
























 that is one of the big questions i think . can google choose the lesser of two evils in a bad situation ? 




 not bad 

















































 **and whatever you do do not finish eating the forbidden donut* 




 no just disappointed 




 you should go to hell ! 





























 resubmitted was not just you !

 ok i can fix this ! 




 because the south 




 hey now we all know the pitchfork thing is fake just like jesus being a brown person instead of a blond white bearded guy ! 









 sell one soul and get twice as much on your second trade-in ! 




 pretty sure it is the whole canopy as shown in the later images and not the one module . rooftops would be a great application as well as the exterior walls of buildings for sun and shade modulation . 









 ~~lots of possibilities including self-sufficient and off-grid architecture as well as self-regulating building climates and shading systems . sort of like growing crops, simple materials can produce compelling outputs organically .~~

so i read that wrong ! biological systems require a lot of upkeep and retrofitting such systems to existing buildings would be costly and take a long time to pay off . also what /u/finalfate said [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/35k0tx/unveiled_in_milan_the_worlds_first_biodigital/cr5762l) 



















 upside down one no less !

 \#TIL ! 




 jesus herpes christ ! 




 and what if they find a tiny smudge next to a larger pile and test the smudge ? seems like a lot of potential problems 




 or focus more on alternatives and stop subsidizing oil 




 it seems likely . hard to picture they would just stand down  









 it seems like there could still be a breakthrough that lets us travel farther and faster than we currently think possible 




 seems really complicated but also fun ?
