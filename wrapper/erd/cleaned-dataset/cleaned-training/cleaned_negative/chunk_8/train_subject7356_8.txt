 He just doesn't even seem distracted the last couple of times I've seen him. I've known him for a long time and I might be wrong but most of the time he just seems completely normal which is making me find it really difficult to separate the depression from him.
No he doesn't do housework. I do lean on him sometimes, but only for a hug and an 'it'll be ok' kind of thing. He doesn't come to me for emotional support, he doesn't go to anyone - he likes to be by himself when he isn't happy.
