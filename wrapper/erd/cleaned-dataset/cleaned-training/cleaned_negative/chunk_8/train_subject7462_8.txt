 Commentators often suck.  They should comment on the game in progress, not the financial status of particular player.

Commentator audio is often too low an overwhelmed by crowd noise.  Bad mixing.

Too many replays of minor incidents while game goes on.

Water droplets on camera front end.  Compressed air works.

Games are excellent so far. 




 Thank you.  It is out of nether. 




 Thank you.  I will give it a try. 




 My hard drive went south.  Starting from scratch.  I don't want to bore you why I NEED to bring this dinosaur back to life.  I looked in all the obvious places.  Please help.

 If you closely look at the modulation envelope you will see that it is composed of what resembles sine waves but they are not perfect.  Their amplitude is constantly changing so they are not perfect sine waves hence the sidebands. 














 Look again using a human.  It is there.

 Newer microwave oven transformers use inverter technology which requires high frequency power transformer,  If it is in your power range it might be worth investigating.  Same with desktop computer supplies.

 Why do glasses shops resent making glass lenses?  They push plastic which is easier to scratch.  I work in environment where it is hard to avoid abrasives.  Even today's glass seems way softer than what was used years ago.

 It is going to get worse before it gets better. 









 In a DC solenoid you have inductance which will limit current rise (along with coil resistance) until the magnetic field has built up.  After that the current is determined by the coil resistance.  The initial current is zero. 














 Solenoid is an inductive device.  There is no inrush current.
