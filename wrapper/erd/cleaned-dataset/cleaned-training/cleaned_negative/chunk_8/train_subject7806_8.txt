 Thanks! Built a Jhonny 5 before actually so I'll build on it. 




 Thanks for the assistance! I don't have tens of thousands and if I do, I'd spend it for sure :D UK robots are pretty lame, I'll go for the Japanese ones and will update here once I built it.  









 Works fine now I guess, can you try on your side? 









 Yea because Arduino.org is still manufacturing in Italy. 




 Yea but Arduino.org is still made in Italy, one of them will kill the other eventually. 









 Out of the room actually! 









 Thanks for sharing, I use Codebender.cc, it's an online IDE for all Arduino a-like platforms. 









 Totally agree, thanks for your feedback and i will pass it to them for sure :) 




 You're right some stuff about the campaign look fishy, i do know them personally though and they graduated from an accelerator called Buildit in Estonia. 









 The problem is not the sensors but the data rate with BLE, in other Bluetooth modules the rate is 115 Kbps.
