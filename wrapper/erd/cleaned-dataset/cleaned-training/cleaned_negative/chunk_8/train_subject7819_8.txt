 Intensive potty training through ABA worked for us. It was a week long of prompting child to drink liquids so they felt the urge to use the restrooms. You need a motivator of course that will act as a reward. You start in the Restroom and as they use it in succession they receive their reward ie...  IPad, toy, snack, it can be anything. After a few successes you move closer out of the restroom and eventually you repeat this throughout the entire house. It was intense and you spend a whole week doing this from 9 am until bedtime, it was really tough but rewarding. My child now goes to the rest room without prompts and wears underwear without issues. I definitely recommend looking into this.

 When is it going to occur?  
























 Yes, I would move to Florida, Governor Scott signed a bill in 2013 mandating that Private therapists must be allowed to provide services in the classroom. Look into Florida Senate Bill 1108. I've also heard Pennsylvania is pretty easy to work with. I have more experience with Florida if you have any questions. Good luck.  




 This top secret Cold War research program initially looked for ways to defend against a chemical or biological attack by the Soviet Union, thought to be far ahead of the United States in "psycho-chemical" warfare. But the research expanded into offensive chemical weapons, including one that could, according to one Army film obtained by CNN, deliver a "veritable chemical ambush" against an enemy. 















































































 Awesome, Tom. Way to go, thumbs up.  



















 Its the principle, it makes me think they are going the way of AT T.

 "We put in a very compelling case, that's all I'll say," said Kessler, who left league headquarters at 8:42 p.m. ET. 




 The owner needs to dedicate some advertising space on the jerseys remembering him.  




 I can charge mine in 2 hours and lasts me days, full brightness and heavy user.  




 Then your tied to the charger and makes it a nuisance. Some people are in a hurry and their phone is less than 30% battery, that's not enough and it will run out while not at home, true they make car chargers.  




 I have to agree, the black case may not be astethically pleasing but only have to charge it about every three days, I am a large data user. The zero lemon should come standard with all mobile phones. I was only getting a max of 5 hours with the stock battery.

 I tried it and it seems to be working. 




 There is actually a company (fancam) that takes a large number of photos and then pieces them together, a lot of people tag others kind of like "I was there". I particularly like the quality, you can even see who is sitting in the nosebleeds. 



















 Someone else would have six rings.  




 No, same principle the Lakers tried with Hall of Famers. Assuming they had a deep bench and some role players maybe.

 Thanks, do you have a suggestion for a good switch?  




 It's in the wall already with a plate but doesnt work. There's no wired network.  




 Yes. There is no router or modem in the junction box so my Internet is wireless. What hardware would I need to connect in the junction box to be able to make a wired network, I have a good 4 to 6 cable running to the junction box.  




 My router is in office in the house. 
The junction point with all the cables are in the garage.  









 Here is my current set up
- Our house came pre-installed with cat-5e in 4 rooms all going down to the garage in a central panel.

- Our Internet connection comes through a coax cable to a cable modem located in living room. 

- One wireless router connects to the cable modem for my home to share our internet connection within our home.
So I'm not using the wired networking in my home today, and I would like to change that.

- What piece of hardware would I need to buy? 

I would like to connect my fire TV to the network as I get a lot of buffering but don't want to put modem or router in garage because of heat/cold/humidity. 

Here's a picture of where the cables lead into the garage. http://imgur.com/B7AxmEz
