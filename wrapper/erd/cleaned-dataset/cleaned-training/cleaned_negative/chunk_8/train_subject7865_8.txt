 If there aren't many longitudinal studies, how do people develop informed opinions? 




 If men are going to start wearing skirts, they will need to learn about the magical world of thermal tights 
























 I had a 'friend' like that at uni - we came to the conclusion that she probably has [histrionic personality disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder) 














 That's interesting - the author sees it as a really bad thing. I'm not sure I'd want to spend the bulk of my life away from the physical world, but I'd love to be able to make regular holidays! 









 Those two things don't sound mutually exclusive. 




 That film caused a spate of mini breaks among my friends. I've seen so many photos and heard so many stories about how wonderful a city it is that I almost don't need to go there myself. 




 Hackers.  









































































































































































 There's a commercial/concept video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRz6UBLNrk) 





























 Most people regard ending ageing to be akin to magic - it's never taught as a possibility in schools, and has not entered mainstream consciousness as a viable idea. Because of this it's not widely discussed in mainstream media, and so most people never get the chance to hear about anything related to sens, let alone the organisation itself. 




 Totes amazeballs 




 Links to websites that steal their content. They're usually fairly easy to spot as they tend to have a very generic theme and no authors  




 My MIL donated a bag of my clothes to charity - they'd been drying and I put them there as I didn't have time to put them all away. I had a bunch of stuff in there I really liked that was no longer on sale :( 




 Assassins Creed. The storylines are just absurd, the collectibles tedious and 3 has the most infuriating use of loading screens since Sonic 06. Like the sea battles in 4 though

 It's been a pretty awesome week for futurology in general!

 Good luck all :) I hope whoever wins is justly rewarded for their efforts! 




 For most of us, the CD is a dead format for music. So what was the CD that will forever be your final purchase?  



































































































 Those of you that have bought the Link Amiibo - has it got the yellow stalk? Did you find that a problem?  
































































 Why was this downvoted? It's an entirely legitimate comment! 

















































 These days both countries have some great beers, but they don't tend to get exported 




 I think the biggest problem is that most countries are governed by politicians who change after quite a small period of time, so stuff like this usually isn't worth making a big deal of yet, because the effects will mostly be felt after they are out of office. 
They'll probably tell you it's your fault you haven't opted to become a cyborg.
