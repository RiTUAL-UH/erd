 Every time I hear it I have a small chuckle because it sounds like  complete gibberish. Then I wonder how exactly do you teach Finnish to someone?  





























 Has Hulu expressed any interest ? 
 




 Just that. They are taking applications for marriage licenses but that aren't giving out the actual licenses yet.

 Good for Rampone  




 You don't need to apologize, most people here agree with you 

 




 the "I believe that we will win " chant  




 Fox announcer can't talk  




 if it's retractile why isn't it closed ?

 YES !!!! http://i.imgur.com/KkTLC0t.gifv 




 I can get behind this  




 it's reddit. what else did you expect  




 Fox keeps trying to get people interested in the MLB all star game, good luck with that

 not a gif but a vine https://vine.co/v/enWYUY1iM9l 




 

that's every fanbase  




 if the US was playing England I think it would be nothing but Revolutionary War jokes (with jokes about needing to be bailed out during WWII thrown in)  




 It's typical for American live broadcasts to be delayed by 7 or 10 (maybe more) seconds in case something bad happens  




 Japan isn't letting the score bother them  




 reddit told me about the goal before I saw it on FOX, stupid 7 second delay  




 we may have a game brewing  




 I think England would have been a better match up
 




 well, they're not wrong

 ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME  




 that didn't take long  




 Go, Go, USA ! 



















 That's an awesome breakdown by the WSJ, good find  









 Cruz was never going to get a large amount of Hispanic voters (I don't think he was even going to try). His defense of Trump has insured that he won't  
































































 God Damit I come here to laugh not cry  




 I like using South Korea as UN speaker cosseting the current Secretary General is from South Korea  




 Germanwings cockpit  




 Ted Cruz should go back to Canada  




 Should anyone be surprised?  









 One theory I heard was that reddit changed their policy and wants employees to start working out of HQ in San Fransisco and Victoria lives in NYC  




 I live in the Atlanta area so I know exactly what you're talking about with the lack of salt in the winter time. When it snowed here a few years ago it came out that the entire city of Atlanta had 20 salt trucks, of which only 10 worked .  




 AC is a necessity in order to live down here. It's one of those things you get used too. The humidity is also usually very high as well so if you factor that in you get days where the temperature feels like 37 plus. 

The weather here in general can be pretty crazy. In March there was one week where we had about 4 inches of snow then the next week it was 24 C  




 This is my new favorite thing  














 It's 60 minutes Australia 

 









 Mark Sampson says that Bassett " didn't deserve that " and "it's ok to cry"  




 I laugh whenever they show the Gazprom logo. The only reason Gazprom is a sponsor of FIFA is because it's owned by the Russian government. The bribe had to look legit

 Happy (early) Canada day ! 









 Don't forget the time [he dismissed concerns about the chemical BPA saying worst case is some women may have little beards](http://bangordailynews.com/2011/02/22/health/gov-lepage-dismisses-dangers-of-bpa/) 

also[ the time he lashed out at Democratic state senater by saying that he 'claims to be for the people, but he's the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline.' ](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/21/paul-lepage-maine_n_3477910.html) 

and when he [ referred to the IRS as the Gestapo](http://www.pressherald.com/2012/07/07/governor-says-irs-new-gestapo-in-radio-address/) 







































 This is what those clerks in Texas should do  

















































 That would cost more  




 The article mentions that above and below ground passes are part of the project .  







































 Georgia's flag https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)#/media/File:Flag_of_Georgia_(U.S._state).svg

official flag of the Confederate States of America  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America#/media/File:Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America_(1861-1863).svg 




 Just be thankful that it no longer has the confederate battle flag in it. To change it what it is now took 15 years and required a huge amount of political capitol and last minute political maneuvering to get it through the legislator.  

 




 To be fair to Bobby that's most republicans  







































 The marriage problem is taken care of. There might be a few jurisdictions in places like Alabama and Mississippi who refuse to comply with the courts ruling. They face legal consequences if they do.  




 Stopping 'religious freedom laws' from being passed and making sure that sexual orientation and gender identity become protected classes (joining race, religion, gender, national origin, and age ) that can't be discriminated against in terms of employment and housing  
























 The news just came out, more info will be provided as time passes  





























 He better not be talking about a new arena, there is absolutely nothing wrong with Phillips.  



















 "not available in your country" 

so that's what that feels like 

 









 He is also really sincere. Here he is talking about why he did the movie Tootsie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPAat-T1uhE 














 Very surprising to say the least, seeing how Kennedy was willing to gut the Voting Rights Act it's interesting to see that he decided to save this one.  









 That's too logical for Alabama.  




 god damn I hate idiots  









 a feel good story i felt like posting  









 This is Alabama we're talking about. Christian morals forbids it. (Plus all it really does is take money from poor people who either get addicted or think they will get rich quick)  














 When the Federal Court declared Alabama's Gay marriage ban unconstitutional (and the ensuing legal battle that followed) the comments on AL.com were not only entertaining but also really depressing at the same time.   




 The state is in a huge budget hole they have two options: either raise taxes or legalize gambling through casinos and the lottery. Neither one is particularly popular but the governor prefers the tax increase option. 

(It helps that the governor won't face reelection because of term limits)  




 yes. Most people associate the USC abbreviation with Southern Cal, so the 'e'  makes it clear to people that you're talking about South Carolina  


































 "Rumors of my demise are greatly exaggerated"

I think that USCe will be fine, not at the top but good enough to be a decent team.
