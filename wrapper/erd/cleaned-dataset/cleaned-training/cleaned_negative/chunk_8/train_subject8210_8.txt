 He was responding to a post where the other guy (in response to me) said:

You're probably not black. 

So /u/Not_the_brightest followed up by stating he was black.  Why?  Likely so the guy who was so concerned about skin color knew what "direction" it was coming from. 




 1,507

That's the number of people polled.  Let's not put too much emphasis into those stats. 




 Where'd I say that? 




 Exactly. It's like a footnote in time already. And once again, this country's obsession with symbols is what's important.  




 Well, I certainly can't think of any flags that teach people an ideology.  Only people can do that, along with giving seemingly unimportant things "meaning."  

but this specific issue is simple to understand

And the reason why I believe people are so focused on it.  To look at and attempt to solve the real problem is not simple. 




 and where could someone learn about an ideology that believes black people are inferior?

Other people.

 The more I read about the crap this guy says, the more I'm convinced that he still aligns himself as a Democrat (2001-2009) and is actually trying to sink the GOP in the next election.

 I personally think the shooting has gone in the wrong direction.  The overall problem is not the flag.  While the media may have you believe otherwise, it's actually a miniscule little piece of the whole picture.  We're never going to get anywhere if we keep focusing on things like a flag.  It's the ideology/mental health that is the problem.

On a side note, the first thing I think of when I see the flag is the Dukes of Hazzard and the General Lee.

Bass is also famous in Japan for the "Curse of the Colonel". Following the 1985 Series victory, revelers celebrated by calling off the names of team members one by one. At each name, a fan who looked like that player would jump into the filthy Dotonbori canal. For Bass, someone threw a life-sized model of Colonel Sanders, the mascot of Kentucky Fried Chicken and the only close-at-hand likeness of a bearded American, into the river. The statue disappeared and is said to have caused the subsequent decade-long dismal performance in the Central League.

In an attempt to remove the curse, fans made repeated attempts to find the model, making offerings to the statues of the Colonel for forgiveness. In 2003, when the Tigers returned to the Japan Series after 18 years with one of the worst records in the Central League, many KFC outlets in Kbe and saka moved their Colonel Sanders statues inside until the series was over to protect them from rabid Tigers fans. The newly replaced Colonel Sanders statue in the Dotonbori KFC branch was bolted down to prevent a repeat of the incident.

On March 10, 2009, the top half of the statue (minus hands and legs) originally thrown into the Dotonbori River was recovered during construction of a walkway. A diver said that he had thought he had found a large barrel, but was surprised when it turned out to be the upper body of the Colonel. The statue's legs and right hand were recovered the following day. The statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. The statue of Colonel Sanders is currently in a KFC franchise across the street from Koshien Stadium.

As a boy, John Wilkes Booth was athletic and popular, becoming skilled at horsemanship and fencing. A sometimes indifferent student, he attended the Bel Air Academy (now Bel Air High School), where the headmaster described him as "[n]ot deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time". In 18501851, he attended the Quaker-run Milton Boarding School for Boys located in Sparks, Maryland, and later St. Timothy's Hall, an Episcopal military academy in Catonsville, Maryland, beginning when he was 13 years old. At the Milton school, students recited such classical works as those by Herodotus, Cicero, and Tacitus. Students at St. Timothy's wore military uniforms and were subject to a regimen of daily formation drills and strict discipline. Booth left school at 14, after his father's death.

While attending the Milton Boarding School, Booth met a Gypsy fortune-teller who read his palm and pronounced a grim destiny, telling Booth that he would have a grand but short life, doomed to die young and "meeting a bad end". His sister recalled that Booth wrote down the palm-reader's prediction and showed it to his family and others, often discussing its portents in moments of melancholy in later years. 









 doing my part for reddit 

Funny you claim to be doing your part for reddit.  If you read the reddiquette of reddit, you'd know you are going against what reddit wants.  Congrats, you've broken at least five of them.  Go stalk someone.  [It's super cool!](http://i.giphy.com/LVIbmaUwpRJ1C.gif)

**Please don't**

1) Conduct personal attacks on other commenters. Ad hominem and other distracting attacks do not add anything to the conversation.

2) Insult others. Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion. Constructive Criticism, however, is appropriate and encouraged.

3) Troll. Trolling does not contribute to the conversation.

4) Complain about other users reposting/rehosting stories, images, videos, or any other content. Users should give credit where credit should be given, but if someone fails to do so, and is not causing harm, please either don't point it out, or point it out politely and leave it at that. They are only earning karma, which has little to no use at all.

5) Complain about reposts. Just because you have seen it before doesn't mean everyone has. Votes indicate the popularity of a post, so just vote. Keep in mind that linking to previous posts is not automatically a complaint; it is information.

You think people who *chase* karma are sad.

 My post history has nothing to do with this conversation.

It displays to everyone that you're the type of poster who lacks attention in real life so you jump online to get it.

You posted a shitty link. 

Great.  I'm glad you thought so.  That's why they have up/down vote options.  However, if you'd like to continue to display to everyone that you have nothing to contribute to anything, keep posting the way you do.  Additionally, being that you made your first post a minute and a half after I posted it, it's probably a safe bet that you didn't even read the article anyway.

Yeah, I called him up on my CB radio.  /s  Get a grip.  It's just another person who sees what a dolt you are.

You may have seen it before.  Good for you.  You're not everybody.  Not everybody has seen everything before.

You clearly can't read and comprehend if you think I said reddit needs/has to have reposts.  

You can sort a subreddit by best and catchup anytime.

I don't care.  Not how I use the site.  

This works great but they have to delete (hide) all the reposts for it to to work well.

And at some point, there will be no new content as everything is eventually a repost.  For someone who wants people to post OC, you should take your own advice as you've provided very little OC over the past few years you've been a member.  Quit being a bottom feeder, complaining about what people post, and contribute yourself.  I mean, Jesus dude, you actually [stated](http://redd.it/3azpgy) that you like to follow people around and hound them about karma.  Go outside, hop on your bike, and go for a ride.

At the time of founding, it was not considered appropriate to mention the word cancer in public. Information concerning this illness was cloaked in a climate of fear and denial. Over 75,000 people died each year of cancer in just the United States. The top item on the founders agenda was to raise awareness of cancer, before any other progress could be made in funding research. Therefore a frenetic writing campaign was undertaken to educate doctors, nurses, patients and family members about cancer. Articles were written for popular magazines and professional journals. The ASCC undertook to publish their own journal, Campaign Notes, which was a monthly bulletin with information about cancer. They began recruiting doctors from all over the United States to help educate the public about cancer.

 The Boondock Saints is a 1999 American crime film written and directed by Troy Duffy. The film stars Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as fraternal twins, Connor and Murphy MacManus, who become vigilantes after killing two members of the Russian Mafia in self-defense. After both experience an epiphany, the brothers, together with their friend "Funny Man" (David Della Rocco), set out to rid their home city of Boston, Massachusetts of crime and evil, all while being pursued by FBI Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe).

Duffy indicates that the screenplay was inspired by personal experience, while living in Los Angeles. Initially regarded as one of the hottest scripts in Hollywood, the movie had a troubled production and was finally given a limited theatrical release of only five theaters for one week due to the Columbine High School massacre. It was met with poor critical reviews; however, the film ultimately grossed about $50 million in domestic video sales and developed a large cult following.

 While Sega was seeking a flagship series to compete with Nintendo's Mario series with a character to replace Alex Kidd as the company's mascot, several character designs were submitted by its Sega AM8 research and development department. Many results came forth from their experiments with character design, including an armadillo (who was later developed into Mighty the Armadillo), a dog, a Theodore Roosevelt look-alike in pajamas (who would later be the basis of Dr. Robotnik/Eggman's design), and a rabbit (who would use its extendable ears to collect objects, an aspect later incorporated in Ristar).

Eventually, Naoto Ohshima's spiky teal hedgehog, initially codenamed "Mr. Needlemouse",was chosen as the new mascot. Sonic's blue pigmentation was chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo, and his shoes evolved from a design inspired by Michael Jackson's boots with the addition of the color red, which was inspired by both Santa Claus and the contrast of those colors on Jackson's 1987 album Bad; his personality was based on Bill Clinton's "Get it done" attitude.

 Christopher Lloyd was cast as Doc Brown after the first choice, John Lithgow, became unavailable. Having worked with Lloyd on The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (1984), producer Neil Canton suggested him for the part. Lloyd originally turned down the role, but changed his mind after reading the script and at the persistence of his wife. He improvised some of his scenes, taking inspiration from Albert Einstein and conductor Leopold Stokowski. Brown pronounces gigawatts as "jigawatts", which was the way a physicist said the word when he met with Zemeckis and Gale as they researched the script, rather than with an initial hard "g", although both pronunciations are acceptable. Doc Brown's notable hunch came about because at 6'1" Lloyd was considerably taller than Fox at 5'5", and they needed to look closer in height.

 In 1998, the tabloid newspaper The Globe reported that Malone had been a defendant in paternity lawsuits, filed shortly after Malone began his professional basketball career in the late 1980s, which alleged that he was the father of three children by two women from his hometown of Summerfield, Louisiana: Demetress Bell and twins Daryl and Cheryl Ford. Malone was 17 when the Ford twins were born to Bonita Ford, who was approximately the same age. However, Malone was a 20-year old college sophomore when Gloria Bell, at age 13, gave birth to Demetress. In the aftermath of the Globe story, Malone met with the Ford twins for the first time since visiting them in the hospital after they were born. Malone did not meet with Bell at that time, and Malone's attorney insisted that Malone had settled the lawsuits prior to any conclusive establishment of paternity, and thus still did not know whether he was truly the father of any of the children.

The Tribune confirmed that the judge in the Bell lawsuit ruled Malone to be the father, not based on presented evidence, but rather because Malone did not respond to the suit. However, the paper also examined court documents detailing the evidence that was to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One of the items listed was a laboratory blood test which concluded with over 99 percent certainty that Bell's father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying that same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone. According to the Tribune, Malone challenged the court's ruling with regard to Bell, claiming that the judgment holding him responsible for $125 per week in child support, plus past and future medical expenses, was excessive. Before Malone's appeal was adjudicated, the lawsuit was settled on confidential terms. In the case regarding the Ford twins, Malone was ruled to be their father when he violated a court order by refusing to reveal his assets or submit to a DNA test. Thereafter, another out-of-court settlement was reached.

By the fall of 1998, Malone accepted his paternity of the Ford twins, and Kay Malone spoke publicly of the twins being members of the Malone family. Since that time, Karl Malone has maintained a relationship with the twins, each of whom later played college basketball at his alma mater of Louisiana Tech University. Cheryl Ford went on to a professional basketball career with the Detroit Shock of the Women's National Basketball Association.

To date, Malone has made no public comment with regard to Bell, who is now an offensive lineman for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League. In 2008, The Buffalo News reported that Bell's first and only meeting with Malone came shortly after Bell graduated from high school. According to Bell, Malone told him at that time that it was "too late" for them to have a father-son relationship.

A Brazilian woman has confessed to trying to kill her husband by putting poison in her vagina and urging him to have oral sex with her, a news agency claims.

The bizarre murder plot, dubbed "cunning cunnilingus" by one commentator, took place in the city of Sao de Jose Rio Preto.
The intended victim, a 43-year-old man who has not been named, says his wife tried to lure him into bed and encouraged him to perform oral sex on her. His suspicions were aroused when he noticed an unusual odour emanating from her private parts and, fearing she was unwell, took her to hospital, Brazil's Tvi24 reports. Medical tests revealed she had doused her vagina with enough of the unspecified toxin to kill both her husband and herself.

Confronted with the test results the woman reportedly confessed to her crime. It is believed she hatched the bizarre plot after asking her husband for a divorce, a request he now seems rather more likely to acquiesce to. Tvi24 says the woman has received medical treatment and sources claim her husband plans to sue her for attempted murder.

 Unable to support himself, on May 27, 1827, Poe enlisted in the United States Army as a private. Using the name "Edgar A. Perry", he claimed he was 22 years old even though he was 18. He first served at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor for five dollars a month. That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry, Tamerlane and Other Poems, attributed with the byline "by a Bostonian". Only 50 copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention. Poe's regiment was posted to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina and traveled by ship on the brig Waltham on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to "artificer", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his monthly pay doubled. After serving for two years and attaining the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank a noncommissioned officer can achieve), Poe sought to end his five-year enlistment early. He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard. Howard would only allow Poe to be discharged if he reconciled with John Allan and wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic. Several months passed and pleas to Allan were ignored; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, John Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point.

Poe finally was discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him. Before entering West Point, Poe moved back to Baltimore for a time, to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter, Virginia Eliza Clemm (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe. Meanwhile, Poe published his second book, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems, in Baltimore in 1829.

Poe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, John Allan married his second wife, Louisa Patterson. The marriage, and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs, led to the foster father finally disowning Poe. Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically pled not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing he would be found guilty.

Bologna sausage, sometimes phonetically spelled as baloney, boloney or polony, is a sausage derived from the Italian mortadella, a similar looking finely ground pork sausage containing cubes of lard, originally from the Italian city of Bologna.  U.S. Government regulations require American bologna to be finely ground  and without visible pieces of lard. Bologna can alternatively be made out of chicken, turkey, beef, pork, venison or soy protein. Unlike the mortadella, bologna sausage is not an Italian product and there are several differences among process and ingredients. Typical seasoning for bologna includes black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, celery seed, coriander, and like mortadella, myrtle berries give it its distinctive flavor.

Chevrolet general manager Pete Estes started the news conference stating that all attendees of the conference were charter members of the Society for the Elimination of Panthers from the Automotive World and that this would be the first and last meeting of SEPAW. Estes then announced a new car line, project designation XP-836, with a name that Chevrolet chose in keeping with other car names beginning with the letter C such as the Corvair, Chevelle, Chevy II, and Corvette. He claimed the name, suggests the comradeship of good friends as a personal car should be to its owner and that to us, the name means just what we think the car will do... go. The Camaro name was then unveiled. Automotive press asked Chevrolet product managers, what is a Camaro? and were told it was a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs.

 Despite its name, Hawaiian pizza is not a Hawaiian invention; it is Canadian. The Village Voice, National Post, Toronto Sun, London Free Press and The Chatham Daily News have covered Sam Panopoulos' claim that he created the first Hawaiian pizza at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario, Canada in 1962. A co-owner of the Satellite Restaurant at that time - along with his brother, Nick Panopoulos - Sam and his brother were business partners for approximately 50 years. The brothers would later build on the popularity of the Hawaiian Pizza and begin serving their next creation - the Hawaiian Burger.

 Bridget Driscoll (1851  17 August 1896) was the first pedestrian victim of an automobile collision in the United Kingdom. As she and her teenage daughter May and her friend Elizabeth Murphy crossed Dolphin Terrace in the grounds of the Crystal Palace in London, Driscoll was struck by an automobile belonging to the Anglo-French Motor Carriage Company that was being used to give demonstration rides. One witness described the car as travelling at "a reckless pace, in fact, like a fire engine".

Although the car's maximum speed was 8 miles per hour (13 km/h) it had been limited deliberately to 4 miles per hour (6.4 km/h), the speed at which the driver, Arthur James Edsall of Upper Norwood, claimed to have been travelling. His passenger, Alice Standing of Forest Hill, alleged he modified the engine to allow the car to go faster, but another taxicab driver examined the car and said it was incapable of exceeding 4.5 miles per hour (7.2 km/h) because of a low-speed engine belt. The accident happened just a few weeks after a new Act of Parliament had increased the speed limit for cars to 14 miles per hour (23 km/h), from 2 miles per hour in towns and 4 miles per hour in the countryside.

 When Zartan was originally released in the toy line, it stated on his file card that he suffered from Paranoid Schizophrenia and Multiple Personality Disorder. After a complaint from a mental health organization, Hasbro removed this information from the file for later print runs, and was not referenced on file cards for future releases of the character. In early development, he was called Captain Chameleon. He was later named Zartan, an anagram of Tarzan, by writer Larry Hama.
 









 So the people who are denied a marriage license due to someones religious beliefs should get a tax refund of some sort right, even if it's just $.01? 

These people are paying their taxes to pay those workers who refuse to serve them, which is what a government employee is supposed to do, serve the people.  






















































 Preserve and share the evidence for all to see and know.

Please do.  And make sure you describe the steps you took to get to your conclusion as well as include cited sources to support your conclusion.  This'll be amusing I'm sure. 



















 Ah OK. In TIL, you're supposed to paste the text from the cited article that supports the title.  




 whatever sub he thinks might upvote it

Actually to whatever sub I think it fits in.  

done in such a robotic way

You mean "Copy URL, Paste URL, Paste/Create Title, and Submit?"  That's kind of how everything is done on reddit.

What drives these people to farm karma?  Why do they care?

Here's what I do.  I find reddit to be entertaining.  I also find it interesting to read about random news (not just the big national crap but the local news around the country), politics, and in regards to what I post on TIL, what I usually post comes from my thinking/seeing/doing something and I do a quick search on the topic and post something interesting.  

Why?  Eh, more about curiosity to see how well something will do.  I'm usually surprised at what does well and what doesn't.  Also, in regards to news, I eventually want to have every state/country covered in a submission.  No real reason.  Like I said, just entertainment for those short moments in time at work/home where I need a breather from the regular crap.  I figure finding out new information/news and sharing it is more useful than, say, Candy Crush.

 




 for weak corporate trivia in TIL, *repeatedly*?

The solid majority of [anything I've gotten frontpaged](https://www.reddit.com/user/train_subject8210/submitted/?sort=top) is not corporate at all.  The morons over at /r/hailcorporate fail to realize this. 




 If you ran an advertising firm and noticed that accounts with only advertising content got consistently, immediately identified as shills, what do you tell the people running your shill accounts to do, in order to adapt?

Spend 2+ months posting nothing relevant to advertising or promoting items and slip in approximately 5 things that speak well of a product/company?  Yeah, OK.

I definitely believe you spend all day at work posting on Reddit, though. :P

Primarily the first hour and then I get to work and occasionally click back over if an interesting discussion happens.

though frankly if you spend all day posting on Reddit 

Again, not all day.

It's that you're acting as a shill when you give brand names pointless recognition.

Isn't reddit itself pointless?  Hell, this subreddit alone is nothing more then a central gathering point for advertisers on reddit isn't it?  Is this subreddit a big shill? 




 when people start snooping.

It's blatantly obvious nobody has snooped.  Either that, or people are lacking common sense.

Those are all low-effort submissions. 

As are the accusations.  With zero factual evidence.

It takes no time/effort to make those.

Like empty accusations.

The AMA's by people who do this have admitted to obscuring with other inane submissions.

You apparently haven't "snooped" either.

The concept of a tin foil hat for protection against interference of the mind was mentioned in a science fiction short story by Julian Huxley, "The Tissue-Culture King", first published in 1927, in which the protagonist discovers that "caps of metal foil" can block the effects of telepathy.

Over time the term has been associated with paranoia and conspiracy theories. It is often associated with beliefs that tin foil hats prevent mind control by governments, spies, or paranormal beings that employ ESP or the microwave auditory effect. 









 You should probably look at the rest of my submission history then and compare the ratio of those ones listed to the rest of what I post.  I threw about 6-7 TIL subject items up this morning.  This being the only one about a current product.  Quite honestly, I thought the ones about Ray Bradbury, the people falling into a cesspool of human waste, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind would do better.

Know when I found those out?  Last night.  While I was drinking a Sierra Nevada IPA that I had with my frozen pizza.  And I looked up Sierra Nevada to see if there was anything interesting because while I'm at work, I like to post random crap I find to see how much karma it will get.  Lo and behold this topic was in there.  Nevermind all the articles I post in /r/news, /r/politics, and whatever state/country I can find an interesting topic to post in their specific subreddit just to see if I can cover every state and/or country.

After reading some of the posts here, maybe I should go find some interesting facts about aluminum foil because all I can picture some of you wearing are foil hats.

 In East Asia, same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history.
Homosexuality in China, known as the passions of the cut peach and various other euphemisms has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. Homosexuality was mentioned in many famous works of Chinese literature. The instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber seem as familiar to observers in the present as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period. Confucianism, being primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality, whether homosexual or heterosexual. Ming Dynasty literature, such as Bian Er Chai (/), portray homosexual relationships between men as more enjoyable and more "harmonious" than heterosexual relationships. Writings from the Liu Song Dynasty by Wang Shunu claimed that homosexuality was as common as heterosexuality in the late 3rd century.

Opposition to homosexuality in China originates in the medieval Tang Dynasty (618907), attributed to the rising influence of Christian and Islamic values, but did not become fully established until the Westernization efforts of the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China.

 In high school, Ray Bradbury was active in both the Poetry Club and the Drama club, continuing plans to become an actor but becoming serious about his writing as his high school years progressed. Bradbury graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh, and short story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson. The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing, but he did not attend college. Instead, he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. In regard to his education, Bradbury said:

Libraries raised me. I don't believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries because most students don't have any money. When I graduated from high school, it was during the Depression and we had no money. I couldn't go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years. 

He told The Paris Review, "You can't learn to write in college. It's a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do  and they dont."

 Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. won the US Environmental Protection Agency's "Green Business of the Year" award for 2010.

The brewery is powered by solar energy, having 10,000 photovoltaic modules covering its rooftops and parking lot. In all, the brewery uses 2.6 megawatts of solar electricity on premises.[20] It also has built a charging station for electric vehicles on its premises.

The company processes used cooking oil from its restaurant for biodiesel use in its delivery trucks. In 2009, it reached an agreement with a local ethanol company to produce high-grade ethanol fuel from its discarded yeast. Spent grain is sold to local cattle ranchers for livestock feed; spent water is sent to the brewery's own water treatment plant, where it is reused, mainly as drip irrigation for its fields. Over 99.5% of the brewery plant's solid waste is diverted from landfill.

Sierra Nevada is the largest buyer of organic hops in the United States. It also farms its own organic hops and barley for use in its annual Chico Estate Harvest Ale release.

 The film's origins can be traced to director Steven Spielberg's youth, when he and his father watched a meteor shower in New Jersey. As a teenager, Spielberg completed the full-length science fiction film Firelight. Many scenes from Firelight would be incorporated in Close Encounters on a shot-for-shot basis. In 1970 he wrote a short story called Experiences about a lovers' lane in a Midwestern United States farming community and the "light show" a group of teenagers see in the night sky. In late 1973, during post-production on The Sugarland Express, Spielberg developed a deal with Columbia Pictures for a science fiction film. 20th Century Fox previously turned down the offer. Julia and Michael Phillips instantly signed on as producers.

Two people died and three were injured after wading into a cesspool's knee-deep filth in an attempt to retrieve a woman's mobile phone and rescue those who fainted.

The two fatalities were the woman's husband and mother-in-law, a local newspaper reported.

The tragedy unfolded after the young woman in Xinxiang city, Henan, accidentally dropped her brand new phone into a cesspit when she went to the open-pit toilet on Wednesday, according to local newspaper Dahe Daily.

Her husband jumped in to find the 2,000-yuan (HK$2,510) phone but he could not breathe and soon lost consciousness.

Then, the husband's mother jumped in to save him but she, too, soon lost consciousness. In panic, the young woman followed and suffered the same fate.

Seeing his family lying helpless in waste, her father-in-law called to neighbours for help.

When they arrived, the old man also entered the cesspit but could not get out while two neighbours who jumped inside fainted.

The smell was too strong. I lost consciousness before I could see anything, said a neighbour.

Other villagers found a rope and tied it on rescuers who, taking turns, pulled six people out of the pit.

The husband and mother-in-law died in hospital while the woman and a neighbour remained in the intensive care unit. The father-in-law was also injured.

The woman and her husband had a one-year-old son.

Villagers said the victims were in the pit  which was knee deep in waste for no more than five minutes.

A hospital doctor said the victims suffocated.

Villagers said the dead victims had pulses after being pulled out but the ambulance did not arrive for more than an hour.
