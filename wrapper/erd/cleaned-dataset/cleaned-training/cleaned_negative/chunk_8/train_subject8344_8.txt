 Their foundation is a charity. They do stuff for poor nations and people. It has nothing to do with Hillary's campaign. You conveniently ignore that. 




 That is awesome to you.

* Also you forgot to include your wishlist. 




 Sure. Do I PM you with my email address? 




 Republicans and FOX News want Bernie Sanders to win the Democratic nomination as bad as  democrats want Donald Trump to win the Republican one. It's obvious what FOX News and other right wing "news" outlets are doing here. 




 Yes I did. A bit far away for me. But I will, be looking in the future. This sounds like something I would love to attend. Anything but just going to a bar. 




 No worries. :D 




 I am already going on a camping trip up North that weekend otherwise I would go for sure. I look  forward to the next one though. 




 You need to send this message by PM. Not in the public thread. 




  apparently the equivalent of the N-word for Native Americans


Since when? It was used as a term to describe a woman. Now all of a sudden it's a native American nigger?



 




 Yep. The gas comes in and out of our ports and is refined here. Yet we are paying twice as much as the rest of the country because of a "shortage." Someone is lying. And we have no choice but to bend over. 




 You are most likely correct. Unless you live in So California. They are burning us big time with some price fixing scheme and phony excuses. We are paying over $4.00 a gallon right now. This is legal robbery. 




 rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr..., thank you girlpirate. :D 




 Well thank you for your advice. At least the comment section of this post qualifies for an **advice** tag. 

Thanks bud. :D 




 Thank you. So is **advice** a good enough tag for this post? 




 So are you trying to ask people for help or advice or trying to warn them? I'm just trying to tag your post and am not sure what to tag it with.

 Basically they do not want Obama to be credited with anything good. The only thing they have done for the last six years is try to convince the country how bad Obama is. This would destroy that premise.

Party before country..., no matter how much damage it causes.  




 Forgive my ignorance but I do no know what you are asking for, or offering. Could you put it old man terms?

 Because that is what this post is about. Try to stay on topic for two minutes.  




 Community sucks, Bernie Sanders sucks, Breaking Bad sucks, and things fat girls say are offensive. 




 In the states. Which the GOP seems to think is their prerogative. 




 Oh sorry about that. :D 




 Sounds like an awesome sub. Folks here should really be aware of it. Hope we can work together to help folks out. :D 




 #COOL! 




 It's not the Dems proposing this bill. 




 Kind of nailed that one. I have no response to offer. 




 All of a sudden it is okay for the feds to overrule the states. Come on GOP. Have to make up your mind.

 Ooooops.  




 Did our gas taxes go up 50 cents a gallon this week? 




 Me too. :D 




 No it isn't. You can replace it with this one if you want. :D 




 No problem. There is a big need for it and we am happy that you are trying to feel that hole. We will do anything we can to help.

 I do not know about the food bank. Here you can repost as often as you like for now. But that will change in the near future. 




 #A-W-E-S-O-M-E-! 




 They closed down awhile back. 




 Yes they said that same thing six months ago. This causes spikes up to 10 cents a gallon. But it rose 50 cents a gallon over a weekend. And no new refineries have blown up.

 




 Thank you. Your post is all set. Good luck. :D 









 I would pay anything and everything to see that.

 Yes they do. Because of all the extra taxes and additives. It was already higher though. Now they bumped it 50 cents a gallon almost overnight.

 Damn good guess. 




 Oh so it must be just here in So Cal. They are reaming us here. 




 http://ktla.com/2015/07/13/gas-prices-climb-above-4-in-l-a-after-13-cent-jump-overnight/

Read the article and it shows:

 Prices have jumped some 50 cents on average in the L.A. area since last week, according to AAA.

The gas station by my house where I usually get gas was $3.19 a gallon last week. Now it is $3.89. 




 Didn't see it was in Canada. In the US they are cruel scams to trap poor people in  never-ending cycle of debt. 




 As I see gas prices rise 50 cents a gallon overnight, I have to ask who is controlling this crap? What excuse are they using now? 

Refinery problems? Employee strike? Or some other lame excuse that they pull out of their ass.


Edit: Must just be in So Cal.
No matter what problems we have had in the past, never have they risen  50 cents overnight.  




 Voted

 77% of all people on earth agree with you. 




 When to shut the fuck up. 




 What is it you are asking for? 




 At least he was more polite than Trump was. 




 https://mymoans.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/stating-the-obvious.jpg 




 That is not offering assistance. That is a very bad idea. Those places are total rip offs. 




 Don't do it. 




 Yea, it's Obama's fault. 




 Sure does. And in the end, the other republicans actually look sane. Sad indeed. 




 It's why they love people like Trump. They finally get to come out of that closet. 




 And then say racism no  longer exists.  




 No. 




 https://imgflip.com/i/o5mem
 














 You mean especially redditors can be fooled. 




 15 years ago that would have been true. Now it seems the more outrageous thing you say, the more popular you become. It's now okay for the crazies to come out of the closet. 




 Yea  you lazy Americans got it too good. How dare you expect to get fair wages and work only 40 hours a week in places with safe working conditions?  




 Wow! What an awesome job! 




 You go girl. :D 




 Your gofunfme link does not work. It just goes to the home page of the site.
