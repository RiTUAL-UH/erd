 Tom Cruise in Collateral (2004) 




 The Last Of US. 









 Cafe Kino on Gloucester Road. 




 Plus the companies who they attacked will probably sue them for causing their servers to go offline.....or hire them. 




 Thank god someone mentioned this, such a terrific film with a really interesting script and intriguing characters despite most of them not being visible. 
We had the producer come and introduce it to us at uni and told us some fun facts about the film. Apparently the script was wrote between Boxing Day and New Years and was pretty much the final draft. It was also a 5 day shoot that entailed Tom driving around the same intersection with a camera strapped to the bonnet of the car. The other actors spoke to him whilst sat in a hotel reading through their lines.  




 I really hope David Batista only speaks literally throughout his challenge. 




 These are great....however I do not want to see his interpretation of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. 




 I see the Kill Bill saga Tarantino's homage to Asian films. The first one features about 50 direct references to other films that inspired him across his career while Volume 2 is the western influence of these films. It is all shown in this video that shows these references.

Tarantino has always said he is more of a film lover then a film maker which I respect from him and adds more context to this film as it is often seen as one of his most misunderstood films.  




 *"This is a stick-up"*
