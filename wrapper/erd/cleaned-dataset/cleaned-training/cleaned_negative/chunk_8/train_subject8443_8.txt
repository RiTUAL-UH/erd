 Thanks so much everyone! 




 I'm working on a shoot in August that has a pretty intense pool scene and Post guy and I thought it might be cool to capture some underwater sounds. That being said, I have no idea what that might sound like, or how I would go about capturing it. I did some research, but I thought I'd ask some of the Pros. What do you all think? 




 DMP looks awesome! Thanks for the suggestion! 




 Could you post the code or the program you made? That is awesome!
