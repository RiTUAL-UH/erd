 doh! 




 So this duck walks into a drugstore and gets a pack of gum.  The cashier says, "That'll be $1."  The duck says, "Just put it on my bill."

The next day, the duck comes back and gets a pack of condoms.  The cashier says, "That'll be $5.  I suppose you want me to put them on your bill."  The duck says, "No thanks, I'm not that kind of duck." 









 Bless her heart! 




 I see what you did there. 



















 So Captain America is left-handed? 














 21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.

22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 




 Hmmm ... and if I hadn't voted for you in 2000, Ralph, I'd have voted for Gore, and we never would've invaded Iraq in the first place.  Sigh. 




 It would be nice, if you have a list of related subreddits, to have a way to show how active it is, i.e. show how many readers, and "users here now", next to the link.

1670s, nicompoop. Despite similarity [noted by Johnson] to Latin legal phrase non compos mentis "insane, mentally incompetent" (c.1600), the connection is denied by etymologists because the earliest forms lack the second -n-. Weekley thinks first element may be a proper name, and cites Nicodemus, which he says was used in French for "a fool," or Nicholas. Klein says probably an invented word. 




 Late to the party, but I'll add my 2 cents anyway.  Every iPhone I see in the wild is in a 3rd-party case.  There's a whole industry that has grown up around compensating for this basic design flaw:  The iPhone screen is apparently so brittle that it can't handle being dropped.  At all.  If it were produced by any company other than Apple, people would be losing their shit over this. 




 Came here to say this.

 When Rolex introduced the Oyster Perpetual, the [first waterproof watch](http://rolexblog.blogspot.com/2012/04/1964-rolex-fishbowl-ad.html), in 1926, they got jewelers to display their watches in fishbowls, complete with water and fish.  It was pretty sensational at the time. 









 This isn't an idle question.  As a society we're quickly approaching a state where there just won't be enough jobs, and we'll have to figure out what to do with people.  This is a scary question, but it should be an exciting one.

 So this white guy walks into Starbucks with a parrot on his shoulder.  The clerk says, "Where did you get him?"  The parrot answers, "Jersey".
