 But

Is she going to do the Dinosaur? [](/ppseesyou) 




 I've proper buggered it up though. :( it fires, then shoots upwards.

I think one of my younger cousins messed around with my adjuster while I left it unattended while the battery was charging.  




 Oh neat, I thought the Manor was a zombies only event. Warrington ain't too far out for me.

Definately remember Bibby, and Graham and big Pete sound familiar.

Need to get my hop-up fixed before I venture out again, though. 




 I wish I could join in - alas, I'm in Bolton. Bit of a distance with my current budget issues. :( 




 Last I checked, aside from the Bolton Woodland, closest I could find was over on t'other side of the Pennines in Huddersfield  




 I used to play with First   Only, up on their Bolton Woodlands, and the Rochdale Mill before it got demolished - If anyone went to that last game, brilliant game. I was the pirate running around.

Not been out in a while, Aside from the Bolton woodlands, there's not much about that I can find.. :( 




 [The Great Warrior](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_4QBhwI5w) from Final Fantasy VII

My favourite part of the game - Cosmo Canyon's BGM comes in a close second.

This song though, just fantastic. 




 Thanks again! Always nice to "see" your character for the first time. :D 




 Yep. That too.

;-; 




 Those two are the only thing I've seen so far in my travels on the internet which genuinely renders me sleepless.

Jeff the Killer is probably the worst. The story isn't too bad, but the picture gives me the willies somethin' awful. 




 It's that one time of the year I put a tenner on the horsies.

3 on the top two

3 on the bottom

1 on one in the middle. 




 I've barely finished the intro. :(

Working and studying chews into writing times. (Also, the world is still in development in my head and all that.)
Gimmie a few years. :P 




 And that's only the beginning! (Really!) 




 Unfortunately, not so good. :(

(It's part of the novel I'm writing. The planet eventually gets blown up and most of the population gets away safely on a huge ship. :D) 




 RSPCA might know what to do - maybe see if you can get a hold of 'em in your area.

If not, give the council a buzz and ask for animal control, surely they'll know what to do.

But try the RSPCA first, they'll get 'em, nurse and and put them back in the wild, where as fuck knows what the council will do after they've picked them up 




 Taern the Lynx - Known as a Lixn on Luetem, he's a staunch defender of the sane population of the planet. Armed to the teeth, and just as armoured and loyal to his commander, nothing stops him.

Except maybe an ear scratching from said commander. "They're so good~" 




 It's where you don't cross your hands whatsoever

 Took me 3 goes

That push-pull technique? Total garbage.
 




 I, too, would be happy to talk about the topic. 




 NOPE!

We're ahead according to my counter.

I have also sown seeds of chaos. I transformed some poor sap's cursor!

[](/discordsing) 




 ORANGERED MASTER TEAM!

HERE, SIR. HAVE A SWEET HAT. 




 I have not the fucking foggiest what is going on, but I have a Distinguised Medal of Something Significant, and I had a scepter of the Queens English earlier but that's gone.

WHAT IS GOING ON 




 Huh. 1990 here. Was in school, teacher had the Telly on with it happening.
We sat there and watched it for a bit, then went back to the lesson
(Brit also)  




 We're the closest accent to the Wiganers. We're vital for that translation service! 




 I got the dreaded speed wobble while driving my car on the motorway.

Turns out my tyre had burst. 




 So while I'm not exactly _new_ to the Fandom, an new to actively participating. I'm wondering about Conventions.  I'm aware of the annual Confuzzled that takes place in the UK, but are there any more?

I'm a bit of a convention nut and I've been to a few other fandom cons/general geeky cons.. but every other con I hear of is in the USA and I don't think I could head over there for a weekend, as much as I'd love to.

I think I'll skip on Confuzzled this year due to trying to work out my financial situation, but I'm pretty much open next year!

(Of course, I'm going to Download Festival this year, as well as _maybe_ attending BUCK in Manchester too, and then there's the obvious MCM Expo that turns up once or twice yearly.) 




 Where abouts are you at? I am located somewhat near the Kearsley roundabout. :D 




 I train software over the internet - one on one.

Sometimes I like to slip in funny words and see if they pick up on it.
Chances are, if they pick up on it, we'll have a laugh about it, if not - no harm done. 




 Kai is awesome! I got my commission off her too 




 Holy Shit, and here I thought I was the only one!  




 Not fun when I got to Cambridge at 9am, thought "M25 was wank, Might zip through London to get to Hammersmith. By the time I get there, the rush should be over"

Newbie mistake.

I drove 15 hours that day. It was _not_ fun. 




 Only been in to work. Which involved driving into Hammersmith, dropping some stuff off, and promptly getting the fuck out of there before the 9am rush hit.

I accidentally went into central London once. Nice Sights, but I was 7 hours late home. 




 Bolton - We're like Manchester, honestly. Please ignore the empty and charity shops 




 Mine's been on the fritz recently too.. seems to have picked up today, but I nearly slung my modem the other night. 




 That's Bolton, isn't it? - Opposite the Halifax

That motherfucker got me for parking in the long bus stop, right at the back for a grand total of 20 seconds 




 Cosmo Canyon, definitely. 

Do you think they have the background music going on? I'd settle for just the drums! 




 IT Trainer - Weapons mentor 









 Best bet is to go into google and just type their name

If you knew they went by some nicknames online, you could try that. 




 If you can't find them on the social networks, try asking your old school friends - they might know too. 




 I'm sat here at my desk at work, and I can so, _so_ relate to this

your writing style is fantastic, and I can feel myself really hating Angie, despite never meeting her.

For a little while, I thought you might have been one of my colleagues, but then you mentioned ITS and Finance sitting near each other.. We're in our own building, thankfully. 




 Manchester, on the lurk! 




 I've e-mailed him on info@richardlittlejohn.net

Probably a frontend where some poor intern deals with it all, but it's worth a shot. 




 THANK YOU, SIR. MAY YOUR DREAMS BE POLLUTED BY NAKED LADIES AND BEER. 




 SHIT YEAH I DID. JUST THE ONCE THOUGH

MY BUDDY WAS GETTING ALL DOWN ABOUT HIS CURRENT PREDICAMENT IN THIS AIRSOFT MATCH WE WERE IN.

I DIDN'T WANT NONE OF THIS SHIT, I'M HERE TO SHOOT FUCKNUTS.

I RELOADED, AND SHOUTED SHIT EVEN A DRILL SARGE WOULD BE PROUD OF

"LISTEN TO MOTHERFUCKER, IF YOU WANT TO SORT OUT YOUR PROBLEMS, DO IT IN YOUR OWN TIME, PANSY. WE'RE FIGHTING A WAR HERE - IF I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT FEELINGS, I'D GO TO A COFFEE MORNING AT THE CHURCH. I WANT YOU TO RUN IN THERE RIGHT NOW AND SHOOT AT LEAST 3 MOTHERFUCKERS. IF YOU GET SHOT, I AM NOT - I REPEAT **NOT** - GOING TO SAVE YOUR ASS.

IF YOU CAN DO THIS SHIT, YOU CAN DO YOUR FEELINGS SHIT."

(If it's any consolation, I did help him talk about them later, I was just in character and in the moment) 




 Red XIII (Nanaki) from Final Fantasy 7.

He's that silent badass who always has a minute to listen to his friends.

I have him, and his tattoo tattoo'd onto me. 16 years since I decided he was my favourite character, and he's still there. 




 Single right now. Not actively looking due to my Demi-romanticsm. Asexuality and a low sex drive isn't exactly inspiring to get myself a SO. 

So right now, I'm just playing writing stories, studying and working - and things can't really get much better for me!

I still miss my last relationship though. We were both fur - she was a wolf, I was a fox. LDRs are killer though. 




 When it comes to getting my head down and writing stuff for my novel, usually Ambient stuff does it for me, with a Space-y/Sci-Fi feel to it, like the Deus Ex soundtrack.

"A Thousand Suns" by Linkin Park is an usual one that gets me going, though. Especially "The Catalyst" and "Waiting for the End" 




 Asexual Male here! :D 




 Huh, it's on Ovi store too. I'm temporarily on my Nokia while I wait for my Nex4 to get back.

I'll install it and drop you whatever in a message once I get it set up. xP

Edit: Or not - Vodafone/Nokia think it's fun to not let me use the Ovi store because I've not paid my bill, even though I'm on WiFi.
 




 Yeah, looking back, the noises only ever happened when Voirrey was in the room - but still, there's some weird stuff that went on - like the builder's bread just apparently moving of its own accord. 




 Yep, it is!

[Here's a link for anyone stumbling across these comments later](http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/4915/gef_the_talking_mongoose.html) 




 I'd heard of Gef back when I was doing a lot of research into the Paranormal some years back - same with the ghost of Freddie Jackson.
Still, quite an interesting read, piqued my curiosity and now lots more research to do. :D 




 I'd much prefer to date a fellow ace, purely personal preference, but if I did fall for someone, I wouldn't turn them down or cut off my own love just because they were sexual.

My libido is very low, to the point where I could honestly go the rest of my life without sex and probably not really care. 




 (Sorry I took so long replying! - Had to go pick my sister up from the pub)

Congrats! I know a few Trans people, and they're looking forward to the OK on the HRT.

I've had a few "Eh?" and "Seriously? Isn't that the self reproduction thing?" and my sister said "Oh, so you're just not into relationships at all then?"

But nothing hostile, and when I went to a Brony meet a few months ago and the topic of sexualities came up in the post-meet-pissup, the fellow I was talking to was quite.. excited to meet an Asexual person, as he'd never met any before! Which was quite refreshing 




 Sexuality is a fluid thing - for all any of us know, in a few years, we could be sexual

But, to answer your question - maybe. HRT is a hormonal crazy time, are you currently going through the treatment? 




 I'd heard the term "Asexual" before, but I didn't think much of it - mostly in biology classes - Asexual reproduction. Of course when I saw people referring themselves as Asexual, I just waved it of as internet craziness.

Then I saw Jenni's BBC article - which is the Asexuality we refer to ourselves as, and I was pretty much ".. Damn, that sounds like me" 




 Yes, most definitely. Nothing better than being curled up on the sofa with the one you love, just chilling the night away, talking about whatever and just taking pleasure in each other's company.

An ideal relationship for me..  Hard to imagine.. For me, someone to come home to, tell them about my day, share a meal, talk a bit more, snuggle in bed.. I can't ask for any more than that! 




 For me, I was at work - I used to work checkouts at a clothes store - I had some other colleagues working with me, and every time an attractive woman walked past, they always checked out "dat ass"

Maybe I just wasn't into women, I thought. Was I gay without realising? A few more weeks passed. Nothing. I felt nothing for anyone.. 

But then I met my girlfriend, fell for her after a few months of knowing her as a good friend. We lasted a year before the distance killed it, but all the time - even when we met - I never once thought "I want to do the horizontal dance right now".. I was quite content to just sit on the sofa with her, cuddle, kiss and watch TV.

Cut to last year, I'm lurking on the BBC news site, and I see Jenni and Tim's article. "Hey, that sounds a bit like me.." 




 Evening!

I'm train_subject8542, Demiromantic and based in the UK (It's midnight here!)
I'll be here all night, I hope, and while "new" to the Asexual scene, I've been Asexual most of my life. 




 I got my typin' mode on! 




 Damn! And I just sent my phone back for repair.. :(

But yeah, I used to work shipping/receiving and it was always nice opening a box with a little baggie of skittles or something attached.

Even if you don't get anything extra back, it's always nice to brighten up someone's day. 




 Oh, neat. I just started a trial account the other day. I'ma come lurk on chat before I head to bed.. 




 Bolton's a bit shit, not much goes on here. Half the town is shut, and it's a bit scary walking down Manchester road at night.

I think the only thing interesting about the place is this little tidbit:

In 1651 the Earl of Derby was executed for his part in the Bolton Massacre outside the Man and Scythe

Also, another fun fact: I live 2 minutes down th' road from The "Phoenix Club", which I promptly clip people around th' lug'oles, and say "It's the St Gregory's club, you prick."

But I do quite like our accent. 




 You didn't even capitalize the I either.

You're a monster!  




 What's done is done, the past can't be changed. Let it flow under the bridge and let's hope both parties learn from the experience.

That's how I do with life. 









 23 year old Male, Demiromantic.

Up for it! Depends on time though, I'm free 9pm GMT up until about 3am GMT. 




 Yeah, I remember it now. Proper pain in the arse. Wakka, Lulu and Yuna's summons were my best friends in that fight.

Also, Haste. 




 Was that the giant undead version of the boss, or just the normal?

IIRC, you could just use Yuna and cast Life, or chuck a Phoenix Down at him 




 Too Human.

I spent 5 hours playing that game.. Every time I died, the resurrection animation took at least 2 minutes. When you're getting pissed off with a boss and that god damned fucking angel comes from the sky to grab you, then drop you off a 5 minute run away, you get frustrated every time that bitch comes down from the sky

Otherwise, I thought it was quite fun, I just couldn't stand the delay of getting knocked out of the fight, before being able to take control of your character again. 




 I was the same. 

Went from Fox, to Dragon, to a different dragon, to another different dragon, back to the first dragon, and now I'm a Lynx. Give it a few years and I'll probably be a Dragon again or something.

Go with the flow, do whatever! :D 




 While not the same, I went to a similar convention with no plans whatsoever. It was a first-time con, but it had still sold out. 

I did a lot of milling about, hugging suiters and just chilling with beers and watching panels.

Don't worry about it. Go in, do whatever. That's what they're for! 




 The only two I've done are the /r/snackexchange and the /r/mylittlepony ones (2011 and 2012 respectively)

Neither giftee seemed to give me a hard time over where I posted.. All depends on the person you get!
Heck, you could even get a fellow fur! 




 Aiight.

[Lynx attack go!](http://puu.sh/239p9) 




 The worst I personally encountered was on a friend's stag-do

We booked the field with an events company who run open days there. We had about 30 people with us, so we had the place to ourselves - it's a woodland.

Anyway, we're playing, and everyone's having a laugh, but repeatedly, we'd been telling one of the guys to "Take your damn hits" - At one point, I was stood next to the guy and I could hear the bbs bouncing off his gear.

I'd had it - but the Stag's brother got to him before I did. He snuck up closer and closer, peppering him on full auto with a G36.

He only shouted "Hit!" after a solid minute of being peppered. He was wearing goggles - his face had a few cuts.

He was being a dick through the entire day. Not taking hits, aiming for the head and generally not giving a shit for his or anyone else's safety. 




 Also, there's ConFuzzled this year which is in Leicestershire, which isn't too bad for me, but Northern Scotland might be a bit of a trek.. There's never much in the way of UK fur stuff, maybe apart from local meets. 




 Alas, just a few hundred miles to the south of you. :( 

Nice to find a fellow UK fur though! :D 




 Yeah, was jus' gonna say myself. Go look at "___ Goes to the Dentist" vids on youtube. Some of the inane babble some of them talk is _really_ funny. 




 Bit late, but this is my favourite when I hit the motorway:

[Blue Stahli - Let's Go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lREZy9LBsKI) 




 Poop jokes are hilarious
(Englishman on late shift. :D) 




 You get laughed at? Damn.. Whenever I tell people, I just get "Huh, interesting. Well, whatever."

I have had the odd giggle, but what can they do about it? 

To be fair though, I stopped caring years ago. I have ponies sat on top of my monitor, I have the asexual flag on the back of my car. I am what I am and I ain't changing for no-one, nor am I hiding it.

It's hard to "Let go", but it's probably the best thing I did. Heck, if you don't make a big deal of it, no-one cares. If the topic comes up, mention it. People are more likely to take it in stride and roll with it. 




 Yeah.. I always say Asexual first to let them know I'm not just a weirdo - it's a legit orientation!

Then I say I'd rather be hugging on the sofa or playing laser quest or walking in the park with people.

[](/octshrug) 




 Oh, neat!

It still wigs me out a little when people post about Asexuality when they're not Ace themselves. Everyone else I've ever tried to explain it to were like "what-sexual?" 

[](/spitfuck) 




 You just beat me to it, fellow ace! :D 




 It's the granite top, there's glittery parts in there.  









 There's one game I've conjured up so far for my fictional race, the Feln: Coinsies

Based on an old schoolyard game I used to play back when I went to school.

**Coinsies**

A target is drawn on the floor, close to a wall. This game can be played with as many people as you like, as long as you can find your coin amongst the mess!

Competitors take turns flicking a coin at the wall, trying to get it to land in the centre of the target by bouncing it off the wall. Best of 3 wins the round, and a game normally lasts for 5 rounds

Its origins were back in the Lon empire, in the early 2100 years.. It's very much hard to play is the present day, mostly due to coins being taken out of circulation and digital currency being used globally. People still hold onto old coins, or make their own - just to play the game.

--

(Still early days yet, so this is the only one I have so far) 




 I've known for a while - since I was 18? maybe 17 - I've only recently heard of Asexuality.. I'm 23 in a few days

Until then, I thought there was something up with me, or my friends were greatly exaggerating their desires. 




 Add me if you want - though I'm not very talkative. Talk to me otherwise I'll be sat there on your contact list doing nothing :

 You're all stealing my cat!

Give me my cat back! [](/vswhathefuck) 




 We are almost Birthday buddies! [](/scratchyay) 




 Merry Birthday!

Mine's next week. February 7th [](/twiuhoh) 




 Google+ and Furaffinity, if we're not counting reddit.

Spend the most of my time on Google+ though. I've got an interesting bunch circled on there.  









 Can echo you on the Trainers being derp with the internals.

Luckily, the department I'm in now has 2 of us who are pretty handy with technicals. 

But how do you break a memory slot? Yeesh - I thought the RAM stick itself would break before the slot would. 




 Selling seems a bit extreme to me. If people asked nicely, I used to mock up quick character designs for them based on a personality or a race they wanted. 

Sometimes, no matter how hard people try, trying to create a character just completely eludes them

 




 Same. I was trying to work towards opening one last year, but I just couldn't drum up interest, investors nor funds. 




 No idea, unfortunately. 

Mine's pretty much the lowest it can be, I'm guessing. I was getting refused for even Tesco credit cards. It probably can't get much lower than that. 




 I'm in my "repayment year" - I've dubbed it. Chances are, I won't be applying for credit, rent or anything for a year or two yet. (Still at home)

I'm going to pay off this Payday loan, then clear off my credit card. then slowly start building up some savings. I was stupid in my teens and kept digging too deep buying gadgets and useless stuff. 




 They've frozen interest, but if I can't keep up with repayments (which I can) and I tick over 2 days of agreed dates, I have to pay the rest with interest. 




 Nah, I got on that slippery slope and last month, I finally tipped over the edge of not earning enough to pay what I owe them.

Rang up and said "Guys, can't afford this shit. Repayment plan?" "Sure thing"

Got it set up, and I'll be clear by May. 




 I'm stuck in it now.. Few months and I'll be out.

Luckily Wonga are nice enough to set me on a repayment plan without any arguments! 




 I had fun once.

It was awful

[](/rsangry) 




 I live in Takeaway, just north of Manchester. There's a couple of different awesome stuff up for grabs here.

The Godfather burger is amazing. Burger with pepperoni and BBQ sauce.

(The town's called Farnworth, but holy shit. The two main streets of the town are pretty much takeaway central. [Just 3 of them. I'd guesstimate around maybe 40 takeaways in Farnworth alone.](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en ll=53.546861,-2.392015 spn=0.006923,0.021007 t=h z=16 layer=c cbll=53.546657,-2.391867 panoid=mrJCE4eyN3-dyq7OBNqD1w cbp=12,221.52,,0,5.21)

 




 It's only just started, 2 pages so far, but I'll be keeping my eye on it! 









 These guys were going off the deep end. " show quality is shit compared to season 1." " this episode is the shark jump"

I'm sat here like. "dude. It's got John de Lancie in it and it was fun to watch. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!" 




 [](/vswhathefuck)I know for a fact there's people raging. I had to have a rant at them about it because hot _damn_ people take this pony thing _waaaaaaaaaaaaay_ too seriously.
