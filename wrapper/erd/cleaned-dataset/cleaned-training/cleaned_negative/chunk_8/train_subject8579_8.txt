 Kenneth Kohl is a pen name, so I'm not really attempting to remain anonymous in that way. Some stories are just better told from the third person. 




 Nope - I'm an author. http://amazon.com/author/kennethkohl  Mostly horror stuff, but you can usually find undertones of my alcoholism and struggle with bipolar disorder in my stories.  




 Thanks. I was hoping that this story wouldn't offend any AAs. But, at least it's sorta' carrying the message.
