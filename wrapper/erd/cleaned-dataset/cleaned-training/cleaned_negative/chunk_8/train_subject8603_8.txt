 Enjoyin' a good paid poop in the work restroom. From the sound of his voice, probably a gay, black man starts pooping in the stall next to mine and starts asking me the most awkward series of questions in the most awkward situation imaginable. "Sooooo how are you?" "How old are you?" "Are you a virgin?" "Are you gay?" Noped out of there as quickly as possible.  




 Weirdly tangential story. I was friends with the animator for Waterman early on in the series run. We had both gone to school overseas since we were both Navy kids. My friend went off too college back in the states and I was a senior in high school a few months from leaving myself. One day I get an AIM message from Bryan Waterman, who I was a big fan of at the time along with other flash shows like Tomorrow's Nobodies, asking me to go to my friend's house to retrieve flash files for the DVD release of those episodes and some files that were going to be used on a movie he was working on. I didn't have a car at the time so I had to bike a couple miles to my friends place, then walk back with entire desktop PC precariously balanced on my bike because my friend's house didn't have Internet at the time and I had to email them to Waterman. This was back in 2005, so quite some time ago. What a weird saga that turned out to be.  




 Can't have it any other way.  









 We're considering doing a series of photos with our group of friends, but got stuck on what white people would eat. Subway?

 Good eye, the Aqualad is purely Young Justice though.

 In my experience, every time I've used it or anyone that has paid me through Square has always been surprised at how well their signature comes out with just their finger.  




 There are repeaters you can buy. I have no experience with them, but I know they can range from a few hundred dollars to well over a thousand.  




 Yeah, the high frequency they choose for their network is a huge bummer on building penetration. I'd hoped getting a new phone with a hopefully better radio would do the trick, but no dice. 




 Been doing this for a year and a half and simply the best decision I've ever made in regards to mobile. As long as you're in a generally well populated area, the service is pretty great. Lost count of how many people I've converted onto the plan since I started. 




 I discovered this and cleaned an infested apartment using windex and a hand vacuum. Emptying the contents of the handvac into a spinning garbage disposal was morbidly satisfying after the hell they put me through.  




 Was no one else reminded of [Bioshock Infinite](http://news.toyark.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/04/Bioshock-Infinite-George-Washington-Patriot-Figure.jpg)?
