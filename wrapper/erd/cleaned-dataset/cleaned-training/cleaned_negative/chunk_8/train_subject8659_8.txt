 These things are awesome. I find myself using it for a lot more than just my case and keyboard. Blowing crumbs out from appliances in your kitchen... No problem! Lint stuck in your lint trap... No problem! Etc, etc...

Also, the actual DataVac is crazy awesome 




 It also comes with attachments not shown here. One of which is a ~10" flexible straw that can easily get into the crevices and heatsink fins.

 but... that Adam's apple... 




 A main difference: Surface Pro 3 ships with 8.1 Pro. Surface 3 ships with 8.1.

Pro = Pro 




 The original Surface DID come bundled with a keyboard, but that ran into some issues. One problem is too many packages for retailers to easily carry. There are 5 different flavors of the Surface Pro 3 and 5 different keyboard colors. That means each retailer would have to carry 25 SKU's instead of 10. 

Also, people like choice. I work for Microsoft (disclaimer: all opinions are my own and do not represent Microsoft's stance) and there are many people perfectly content using it without a keyboard as they prefer the pen. It's not like they would have just given the keyboard for free, the whole "package" would have been more expensive anyways, this method just allows users to customize the device to their needs rather than forcing you to purchase items you may not otherwise use. 




 Go to Office.com and try the Office Online apps. Its 100% Free and 100% compatible with Office. Google Docs was super awesome when it launched as nothing was even similar, but there are several choices now. Plus, Office is now free for iOS and Android. 




 The Surface Pro 3 and the Surface 3 both use N-Trig instead of Wacom. The button on the back of the pen will instantly launch a new OneNote page, even if the Surface is locked for super quick note-taking.

The actual writing experience between the N-Trig and Wacom is very similar, although the newer pens feel much nicer than the SP1 and SP2 pens. 




 I have no sources to base this off of, but I believe much of the ivory goes to China and other Asian countries. Most of the campaigns I see are directly marketed towards Western (America, Europe, etc.) Cultures as it is already highly illegal to traffic and there is FAR less demand than there is in certain Asian countries. For all we know, there ARE a lot of anti-ivory, anti-poaching campaigns in Asia. 




 Mine automatically showed up when I was checking out with a Pantry Box. I'm unaware of a location to actually view your credits. 




 I believe they expired yesterday :/ 




 I recently went to purchase an item using my Prime membership and noticed that I now had an option of no-rush shipping and in return I got a $5.99 credit towards a Prime Pantry order. I had never heard of Prime Pantry before, so I looked it up, thought it was cool and selected the no-rush option. The next day, I ordered two more items, and selected the $5.99 for each of these items as well.

I now figured I would have ~$18 towards grocery items, so I loaded up a Pantry box and went to check out, just to find that even Prime members still get charged a flat rate of $5.99 per box (either 4 cubit feet or 45lbs) and can only use a single credit towards the order, letting me get free shipping. What's even more frustrating, is each $5.99 credit is only good for a few days and there's no way I'm making 3 separate Pantry orders in the span of a week. 




 As others have posted, [tablet forms of these are available on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/mberry-Miracle-Fruit-Tablets-10-Count/dp/B001LXYA5Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1427490106 sr=8-1 keywords=miracle+berry)

I've actually thrown "Miracle Berry" parties several times and it's a lot of fun! Just walk around a grocery store and try to think of everything that tastes sour and buy it! Some tips from my experiences... Each tablet will last you about 15-60 minutes (generally about 30 before effects diminish), not ALL the sourness goes away (lemons do not taste like pure sugar), thoroughly dissolve the tablet in your mouth (3-5 minutes) and then wait a couple more for the full effect, and lastly, bitterness is NOT the same as sourness. Eating the lemon peel will still be incredibly bitter.

**Lemons/limes:** Taste like the best lemonade/limeade ever

**Pineapple:** Incredibly delicious, but almost TOO sweet for some people

**Oranges/orange juice:**  Really depends on the kind, but can substantially change the flavor

**Hot Sauce:** Vinegar almost tastes sugary, so it is both sweet and spicy

**Pickled items:** Again, vinegar becomes rather sweet

**Cheese:** Some cheeses taste like "dessert" cheese, especially sharp cheeses, cream cheese, cottage cheese, and goat cheese. Some people don't seem to be as effected by the cheeses as other though.

**Beer/Wine:** Not as profound as citrus, but definitely changes the flavor profile


*Random note of caution: You'll end up wanting to eat a TON of citrus foods. This will give you an upset stomach if you don't moderate.*

 You literally just reposted this from /r/videos...

 




 Yea same here. I'm blowing up instantly on all servers, including self hosted servers with just me. 




 Awesome! Thanks for the review! Ive been looking at the casebudi XL 




 I'm looking for a hardcase for my K7XX's. There are only 3 cases I've seen on Amazon that are verified to fit them, but I'm wondering what other people use. 

I would use these for daily travel (I'm not looking for a locking pelican case or anything) and I'm looking to spend about $20-$40.

 




 As a chinchilla owner... This setup is soo awesome! Looks clean, well made, and super fun for the rats! Great job!

It's too bad my chins would chew through that container in 5 minutes :/ 




 Ohh! Thanks for this! I hadn't even thought to check Amazon :) 




 You put up with it well... Hopefully the light will come to him! 

You may even want to point him to /r/buildapc or similar and see if he can actually learn something :P 




 I purposely save all silica packets I get specifically for this. I have a shoebox sized Rubbermaid that I spill the little beads into... this has saved many a cell phone.  




 Why downvotes?! He actually has a "dickbutt" logo on his drill press if you look closely... 




 Couple of questions:
1. I always choose Quick Match, but there are seldom people on... Is there a different server I could be using?
2. The other day, as soon as I spawned, my plane exploded. Not sure if the server was at its limit, this was a bug or something else. 




 It seems like everyone is trying to create a Xbone/PS4 clone which includes a Blu-ray drive. Sure, add a cheap HDMI cable ($3) and a controller ($40 on sale). You could go with Linux instead of Windows and then the OS is free! 

Also, if you wanna get REALLY nit picky, Xbone actually runs 3 different OS's concurrently and there's no way I'm paying for 3 copies! ;) 




 It's all good :) Type on Brother! 




 You could start a full size mechanical keyboard poll... That's the beauty of Massdrop :)

EDIT: Here you go :)

 I completely agree with you?! I was referring to /u/GoPlayTagPro who was inferring that the keyboards weren't that expensive at $125.

I have a Ducky Shine and I used to have a Model M I picked up at an estate sale. There's no way in hell I'd pay for a Datamancer as you're primarily paying for aesthetics, not performance. Also, LONG LIVE THE TENKEYS!  




 I don't know if you actually looked through the site, but a majority of the keyboards are between [$1000-$2000](http://www.datamancer.com/cart/the-seafarer-keyboard-p-220.html). The link for $125 was for the keycaps only. 




 The dickbutt on your drill press is a nice addition :) 




 Super late to the party, but some of the pros and cons you listed aren't exactly accurate.

**Frequency Response:** Yes, the v2 has a much wider range as far as frequency response goes. That said, a human with almost perfect hearing can only hear ~20Hz-20kHz, so the added range on the v2 is kinda useless. Most people can't even distinguish over 12-15kHz. 

**Cable Length**: You listed shorter cable length as a bad thing, but for many people, having an unnecessarily long cable can be annoying. You can always [extend a shorter cable](http://www.amazon.com/Tripp-Lite-Microphones-Headphones-P311-006/dp/B0091F8G38/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8 qid=1426514185 sr=8-4 keywords=3.5mm+extension+cable), but coiling/wrapping a longer cable can be frustrating and even bad for the cable.

**Mic Freq. Response:** If you consider that a humans talking voice covers a range of about 85Hz-300Hz (a high pitched female scream can reach ~3000Hz), the difference between a mic that goes from 10,000Hz to 16,000Hz is useless in a headset. Since the v2 goes down to 50Hz (vs the v3's 100Hz) that is a tangible difference, although only for men with lower voices.

**Mic Sensitivity:** The v2 has higher sensitivity and will provide more gain, although a 4dB difference isn't huge.

**Headphone Impedance:** Without opening a huge can of worms, there is no ideal impedance for headphones. The relationship that impedance has on sound quality is much more complex, and from a PC gaming standpoint, has more to do with what's driving the headphones (motherboard, sound card, amp, DAC, etc). Also, a 3 Ohm difference is fairly negligible and both headsets can easily be driven my any PC without the need for further amplification.   




 Of course!

The 2015 Edition is essentially the pinnacle of a DIY NAS. The CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard drives, and even the case were all designed specifically for small format server use. This option will give you amazing performance and expandability down the road. The 2014 version is also excellent and for all intents and purposes you probably wont notice a huge difference between the two. Unfortunately, its not as expandable (mostly RAM and hard drives) although you may not want to expand past its already hefty limits. Another huge factor is price... 2015 was $1650 and 2014 was about $1000.

For what you're trying to do with it (media and file server) either are a fantastic option. 




 Acquiring a hard drive...? 

Try Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Kmart, or literally any other place that would sell a computer. Or the internet.

That said, you'd probably be buying a 3TB drive at best and those on sale are about $100. Between the drive(s) and shipping, it would be much easier, cheaper, and faster to just download them yourself. It's also not like you'll be watching everything immediately... Just download what you want to watch soon first, and then download all the rest afterwards.
