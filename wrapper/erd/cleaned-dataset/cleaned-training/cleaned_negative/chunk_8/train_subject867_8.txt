 Went to a wedding of an extremely religious couple. About halfway through the ceremony, the bride starts washing her husband's feet like Jesus did for the disciples. I have no idea what it had to do with getting married, but it was very uncomfortable watching a woman bent down scrubbing her almost-husband's feet in front of a silent crowd. 




 I'm bi. I'm haven't really come out to anyone, but kind of my mom. My father is extremely homophobic and I'm guessing he isn't okay with bisexuality either. 

I'm not planning on coming out to anyone I know unless I get a girlfriend who I'm serious about. I don't know how my friends would react and pretty much my entire family is very conservative. However, when I make new friends I'm pretty open about my sexuality.  




 Minnesota: Has beautiful lakes and a great place to raise a family (very safe, good schools).

Minnesota: Terribly cold, long winters. And it's boring.  




 Beautiful pictures! It's sometimes easy to forget how amazing some areas in the US are.
