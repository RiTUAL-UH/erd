 What's a matre'd by the way?  




 Chef here, I've spent entire nights dreaming about being in the kitchen after coming home from a particularly long/busy service. Also... dreamed a lot about Call of Duty in a period where I played quite obsessively.  




 I think I can spot Leo DiCaprio in there  




 I can't even... Just can't...  




 Unfuckingfortunately yes, it is 

Edit : Downvote me all you want, I just don't see him in the role of Deadshot. His persona is just too well established and to me it's not a good fit for a movie like this.
