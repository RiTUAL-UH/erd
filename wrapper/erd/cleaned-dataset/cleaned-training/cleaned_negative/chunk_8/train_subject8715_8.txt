 Sounds awesome! Can you post that in the doc? I would, but I'm not sure of where you want the line breaks and that can obviously be a pretty important factor in poetry.

Here's the doc again: https://docs.google.com/document/d/109jlykx7_TnQwomYNdkBgx1bMZTunyA2ty7GmeSLbdc/edit?usp=sharing 




 Hello /r/books and r/poetry!
My group and I need help with a social experiment for our Poetry for the People class. We are trying to construct a poem with various users submitting 1-2 lines. We want you to feel free to express whatever poetic style you choose, so it can be a sonnet couplet style, free verse, heroic couple, weird stream of consciousness hormonal teen style, or whatever you think of when you think "poetry"

We're looking for anywhere from 25-50 lines to create a completed poem, so we could really use the help. And if you choose to write, please come back and explain your choices in this thread!

Our professor told us that no one had ever successfully completed a social media approach, so we would love to be the first and gloat. Also, my groupmates don't believe in the power of Reddit and I would love to prove them wrong as well. So please help me force some eating of crow and thank you in advance for your help!

 Oh yeah, I know. It's a good idea for sure. Just throwing my 2 cents in. Also fuck GroupMe. 




 I like the gift card thing. But I guess I just don't get the point of DaddyLeagues when all of those things can be done on the EA Madden page (as far as I know) and we can just twitch everything. 




 As someone with a pretty huge fear of death, I was mesmerized by this book. I was obviously horrified sometimes, what with the really stark and detailed description of the dying process. With that said, I absolutely agree that it is a must read book. Tolstoy's writing is obviously incredible, but the character does not at all reflect any sort of "carpe diem" mentality (at least from what I remember), which makes the book's themes even more appropriate.

Thanks for bringing this up because it often gets overlooked, understandably, amongst Tolstoy's other work. Also, it's a short novella, which makes it a pretty good starting point for Tolstoy's style if you're intimidated by the length of his other works. 




 Not the greatest movie, but the trailer for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was cut beautifully. Also, using Saint-Saens "Carnival of the Animals" was perfect. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAYtpZgelAM
