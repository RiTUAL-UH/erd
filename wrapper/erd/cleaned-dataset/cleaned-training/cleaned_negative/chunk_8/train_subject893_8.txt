 ** 6 people. There was the first person who is unrelated to the whole DEA kerfuffle. Then there were the two people you're talking about. The second one was living with three other SR dealers and DPR OK'd a hit on them because it made it easier to get the one guy. 




 They weren't dropped. There's a pending trial in maryland regarding the murder charges. The sentencing does have something to do with that as the attempted murder charges are what the law likes to call sentencing aggravators. 




 not instant 




 . 




 Damn you're really desperate to believe that this guy is innocent. Nobody persuaded DPR to use a hitman. Nobody even suggested it or alluded to it until he did, ergo nobody entrapped him into committing conspiracy to commit attempted murder in the first-degree. Furthermore, they were blackmailing him by threatening to reveal the identities of SR users which is not illegal, especially because SR at its core is an illegal operation. None of the circumstances would be considered an attempt at entrapment. On top of that none of these guys have been confirmed to be DEA agents, the whole theory that they are DEA agents was created by DPR's supporters. From a legal standpoint if the people he attempted to hit are in fact DEA agents it still wouldn't be considered entrapment because having them murdered was his idea and his idea only. At one point the person he was talking to in that chat log asked if there's another way to resolve the problem because murder draws too much attention and DPR maintained that murder was the only solution. 




 Uh huh? Here's the conclusion of that hit. He's asking for pictures at the end. Still sound like role playing?

**Dread Pirate Roberts 3/31/2013 17:00:** Thank you R W. Ive only ever commissioned the one other hit, so Im still learning this market. I have no problem putting my faith in you and I am sure you will do a good job. The exchange rate is above 90 right now, so at $90/btc, $150k is about 1670 btc. If the market tanks in the next few days, I will send more. Here are some random numbers for a picture: 83746102
Here is the transaction # for 1670 btc to 1MwvS1idEevZ5gd428TjL3hB2kHaBH9WTL4a0a5b6036c0da84c3eb9c2a884b6ad72416d1758470e19fb1d2fa2a145b5601
Good luck and be safe,

**Redandwhite 3/31/2013 23:02:** I received the payment. I appreciate the offer if bitcoins lower in value. We know where he is. Hell be grabbed tonight. Ill update you.

**Redandwhite 4/1/2013 22:06:** Your problem has been taken care of. They seized a bunch of stuff he had with him at the time as well. They said he had a couple laptops and a bunch of usb sticks. Is there anything of that, that belongs to you? They questioned him and he spilled everything he knew. He said that he and Xin were actually working together on this scheme to blackmail you and that they were brought in by a 3rd guy who has been selling on here for a couple years who is a scam artist. Apparently he makes selling accounts, sells for a while and then pulls a big scam and he just keeps creating new accounts after he does his scams. They got that guys name also , I will give that to you free of charge when I meet them to get the picture and computer hardware they got. Rest easy though, because he wont be blackmailing anyone again. Ever.

**Dread Pirate Roberts 4/2/2013 00:55:** Excellent work. Please send any info you can get on this third party along with the picture. The picture can be uploaded here: ------I've removed the link for the sake of the reddit post but it's still in the transcript------
I have no need for any of his possessions, so you can do what you want with that stuff.
Thank you again for your assistance,

 He was talking about using a hitman before anyone was threatening his safety. Have you read the [transcripts](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/read-transcript-silk-roads-boss-ordering-5-assassinations/)? He doesn't come across as someone that's being coerced, in fact he was the one that suggested using a hitman.

**Dread Pirate Roberts 3/27/2013 23:38:** In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldnt mind if he was executed, but then youd be out your $700k. I dont think he is going to come up with the money because he seems very desperate.

Then later when they're negotiating the price he mentions that he has already used a hitman before

**Dread Pirate Roberts 3/31/2013 8:59 :** Dont want to be a pain here, but the price seems high. Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k. Are the prices you quoted the best you can do?

He's not someone that I feel particularly sorry for. 




 First degree murder carries a minimum of life in prison under federal jurisdiction. The people that are serving X years to life with the possibility of parole were convicted of second degree murder which is murder without premeditation. Six counts of attempted first degree murder is definitely enough to warrant life in prison. 




 Legally it should have bearing on his sentencing. It's called extenuating circumstances or aggravating factors depending on the jurisdiction. 




 Entrapment is different than what you appear to believe it to be. Entrapment requires the officer to persuade the suspect into doing something that they otherwise wouldn't do, IE if an undercover cop came up to you and asked you to sell them drugs and you said yes that's not entrapment, but if the continued pressing until you eventually agree then that is entrapment. Creating a problem and then stepping in when he decides that he needs a very violent solution is not entrapment. 




 I think it's the murder/attepmpted murder that really did him in but ok 




 I mean he went to CSU Northridge so it's sort of a moot point. There are two world class universities in his city and a whole bunch of slightly above average schools. Dude has a ton of competition that's probably more qualified.

 That's not what's happening here. She didn't consent to the circumcision per say, the contract was a custody agreement with a stipulation that effectively gave the ex-husband sole guardianship when making this decision. She's not backing out of a circumcision contract, she's reneging on her custody agreement. 




 That's not what's happening here though. The contract didn't say "my son will undergo circumcision," the contract was a custody agreement with a stipulation that gave her ex-husband the power to decide whether or not to get the son circumcised. 




 She didn't sign a contract that forced the son to undergo circumcision, she signed a custody contract that gave her husband authority to decide whether or not to go through with circumcision.

 The kind of people that are executives of fortune 500 companies have an ungodly work ethic, are near geniuses, and can somehow work 15-20 hours a day 7 days a week without going insane or burning out. You can replace a cashier, a customer service rep, a salesman in an instant, you can replace an IT guy in a day, a middle manager in a week, a wall st broker in two weeks, but finding someone that has the education, intelligence, work ethic, experience, and mental fortitude that it takes to run a fortune 500 company is damn near impossible. It's easy to find someone with one of those traits, but probably one in a million people have all of them. The job market is all about supply and demand. The supply of unskilled laborers far outweighs the demand, the supply of college educated laborers slightly outweighs the demand. The demand for someone qualified to run a fortune 500 company far far far outweighs the supply so they are very expensive. 




 A lot of the CEOs that run fortune 500 companies didn't start the company so that's a bit of an odd way to look at it.

 Not really best of worthy 




 So I mentioned to my dad that I'm planning on selling my single speed road bike before I come home from college and he asked me not to because he wants to start cycling casually to go to work and get in better shape. The problem is the guy is getting up there and I think the geometry of my bike might be a bit too aggressive for his back. I was thinking I should get him a comfort style bike and I was originally looking at the Giant Cypress but it's just a bit too far out of my price range. If I need to I'll shell out the extra $50 but if there's anything I can get in the sub three hundred price range that's better I'd like to know. 

Are any of these good?

 Bro anything can work to lose weight as long as you cut calories. I've lost 50lbs from a diet consisting mostly of burritos burgers and sandwiches. The key is to find the best way to spread the calories out over the course of the day that won't leave you snacking. For me I can't do the whole three 500 calorie meals thing because it leaves me feeling hungry when I try to sleep, so what I do is have maybe a snack around lunch and then I eat a 1000-1300 calorie dinner.

 Eh I would start with cycling or distance walking.

If you have a bike then just map out a path for you to take that has more uphill than downhil. Even cycling on a 1% incline is going to burn some calories. If you don't have a bike then just start walking, then speed walking, and eventually jogging.

 I'm working a new fitness regimen that involves C25k. It's essentially just C25k with lifting on the rest days. With C25k did it ever feel like it was moving too fast for you? I've never been a very fast runner and I've never been good with distance running either, even when I was a kid, so I'm kinda wondering if I should improve my running a bit on my own before I attempt it because I don't want to get discouraged and give up. 




 Have you ever slept through it? 




 The silent alarm is one of the most appealing things about the fitbit for me. I always wake up feeling groggy if I'm using an alarm and I usually have to have 4 alarms at 15 minute intervals to actually wake me up. If this will actually wake me up feeling more refreshed then I'm buying one right now.

 Maybe idk for sure though. If that's the case then you guys are getting shafted by your lawyers which really sucks because they're supposed to help you. 




 That's not how it works. The gross settlement was 3mil but the net settlement (settlement after expert witness fees, copy costs, other expenses) was probably closer to 1.5mil, maybe less. The lawyer fees are then 30-50% of the net settlement. The majority of the money goes to pay for the testimonies, private investigative work, and paperwork that actually won you the case. The lawyers are really taking no more than ~25% of the gross settlement. 




 It is not a doctorate in any sense of the word. It is not considered a doctorate by any governing body of academia. That is why it is called a Doctor of PT degree and not a **doctorate** of physical therapy.  




 They do but they recently raised the tax rate on dividends and short term capital gains from 15% to 20% so he's not actually saving himself that much, certainly not 930k in savings. 




 I mean maybe but you can't actually get capital gains until you sell an asset. Their wiki says that the company is wholly owned by the CEO and his brother so I doubt he'll be selling his share soon. 




 It's not a real doctorate. The "doctor of physical therapy" degree isn't an actual PhD or MD program. It's a 3-4 yr professional degree that requires no residency to complete. Here's the USC curriculum for DPT, as you can see it's honestly not that rigorous of a curriculum, just time consuming:

http://pt.usc.edu/Education/Programs/PhysicalTherapy/DPT/Curriculum/ 




 Bro PT degrees are the quintessential former athlete degree. I've got tons of buddies that are or were doing PT. You can get by doing some fairly easy classes. Depending on the school the math requirement is almost nonexistent and you just need to reach 200 level biology courses. It's the anatomy classes that get you, but even then it's not too hard. Most schools don't have cadaver labs.... 




 As far as I can tell this is a private company so he has no shareholders to impress. Cutting your salary by 930k, from 7 figures to 5 figures, so that you can pay your employees more is absolutely not capitalistic. If it's a publicity stint it's way overkill. There's no way this will lead to enough new customers that he can make up the 970k a year. 




 I mean that's solid advice but if this guy might not pull 30k with his major and he doesn't care about the subject then he should change it. If he loves the subject them good for him. I'm lucky because I'm interested in finance and macroeconomics and luckily both econ and finance tend to pay pretty well. 




 It's an interesting move for sure.... and it defies basically every concept of  capitalism. I'll be watching this one to see how it plays out. 




 Daaaaaamn op you rich  




 change majors homie. Even if you're not super smart, physical therapy/exercise physiology/kinesiology majors are basically guaranteed 60k+ if they go into physical therapy. 




 I sorted your comments by top. Literally took less than 30 seconds of my life away 




 nah it doesn't if some of my opinions line up with yours then were chilling 




 I had a suspicion so I did a cursory check of your post history. Found the rp posts in a minute. 




 She's on the wrong side of the spectrum for that to be true. 




 I don't consider myself a feminist. I don't go to feminist rallies. I don't read feminist literature. I consider myself someone that uses common sense to form opinions, and I tend to examine both sides before settling on a position. I have liberal opinions, I have conservative opinions. I support some parts of feminism, and I condemn some parts of feminism. By no means have I been brainwashed by feminists. I will say that the redpill does have some cult like tendencies and it is by no means a moderate position. You guys are to mens rights as the women that advocate chastidy belts and therapy for every man are to feminism.   




 Alright well lets pick apart this video.

1) Right off the bat the lady in the video starts describing why boys have trouble in school. She says that they are "Boys tend to be disorganized and restless, some have even been known to be noisy and hard to manage." 

Now her description of what a "typical boy" is like is a bit weird, idk where you went to school but I had friends that were guys that were completely organized, and I had friends that were a bit messy. Same goes for girls, but the interesting part is the "some can even be noisy and hard to manage" bit. What she's describing there sounds like ADHD, not "typical boy" behaviour. Boys are [three times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD compared to girls](http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/features/adhd-symptoms-in-girls-and-boys). 

2) Then she quotes a psychologist, Michael Thompson, he says "Girl behaviour is the gold standard in school, boys are treated like defective girls." Now I tried to google this Michael Thompson, after a bit of effort I found his website. He has a PhD in... something, I'm assuming psychology. The problem is that in the bio section of his website he makes no mention of where he got his undergrad, where he got his phd, etc. According to his website hes really more of an author because he has never been involved in clinical psychology, and he references no studies to back up his claim, effectively making it an unfounded opinion.

3) She then goes on to explain that boys score lower than girls on national reading exams. I have a serious problem with this claim because she provides no source to back it up and after 15 minutes of googling I can't find anything to support it.

4) She then goes on to cite isolated incidents regarding zero tolerance in schools ~ irrelevent.

5) Every following argument is rooted in broad generalizations about boys.

This video makes a lot of big claims without backing a single thing up with evidence. 




 My guess is that if I looked through your post history I would find posts in /r/mensrights and /r/theredpill. Those are both what psychologists like to call, [echo chambers](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_%28media%29), and they are very unhealthy things to spend extended periods of time in without examining opposing view points and comparing them to your own beliefs.

In the words of the philosopher and mathematician William K. Clifford:

If a man, holding a belief which he was taught in childhood or persuaded of afterwards, keeps down and pushes away any doubts which arise about it in his mind, purposely avoids the reading of books and the company of men that call into question or discuss it, and regards as impious those questions which cannot easily be asked without disturbing it -- the life of that man is one long sin against mankind 




 If you took even 5 minutes to Google Camille Paglia you would  see that she's incredibly controversial in the feminist world, and that most prominent feminists oppose her and view her as an extremist. You would also see that Paglia herself views mainstream feminism itself as a problem, labeling it stalinist and repressive to women

 A SEAL team arrives late in the night at the camp where these scumbags live. They slowly make their way through the camp slitting the throats of the guards and the sleeping soldiers. As they grow closer to the scumbags they go loud so that the fear and the anxiety grows within them as the SEALs inch closer. Gunfire and shouting is all they hear as it dawns on them that some of the most elite fighters in the world are coming for them. The SEAL team finally reaches them and forces them to look at the bloodshed around them. The scumbags flinch everytime one of the SEALs moves their gun. But to the SEALs death is too humane of a way to go for these men, as is anything that the US government would permit them to do, and that's saying something. The SEALs decide to hand them off to one of our more... controversial allies. The Israelis. The Israelis in turn give them to Mossad telling them to do what they wish. After Mossad is done extracting information from them in the most inhumane and excruciating ways possible they decide it's time to kill them. No ordinary execution is enough though. Mossad decides to shackle each of their limbs to a 100lb cement block and leave them in the desert near the Israeli-Palestinian border, but before leaving them there they attach a large saline drip to each of them so that they'll survive the dehydration, at least for awhile. The men then spend their last days wondering what will finally kill them, the sun? a scorpion? A stray Hamas rocket? Starvation? Will they outlast the saline drip and spend their last hours in a state of dehydration induced delirium? Who knows, but it will be a slow death and that is fine by the rest of the world.

 /r/fuckchuck 




 that's because there's nothing to say. They fucked up. I was just pointing out that having eaten McDonald's doesn't narrow down the suspect pool that much. 




 The McDonald's argument wouldn't work because it's the most popular chain in the world and there were probably 100+ mcdonalds serving 100+ people a day in LA at the time. 




 He raped a 3 year old girl. That is the very definition of a violent crime. Moreover, most prison sentences are not served all the way through due to overcrowding.  




 These guys are basically celebrities in the finance world. It may not be right but it was inevitable. 




 This guy opted for a nonjury trial though so the judge is also the jury and theoretically he could be the executioner if they somehow turned this into a murder 1 case and he volumteered for executioner duty 




 That's not how it works. Juries have no say in the sentence. That's what the judge is for. 




 Nope. This is a case of Nepotism.  Her father is a judge in the county (parish because it's Louisiana) where this happened. Apparently every judge in the county had to recuse themselves from the case, meaning they all know her father, meaning the DA probably doesn't want to be on his bad side. 




 Yes, it makes sense to assume that the presumably intoxicated man that was trying to prevent the police from setting up a crime scene at a stabbing is lying.
