 It has like a 90% chance of happening. 




 good points 









 That's odd he can't do that. I'm fat and out of shape and I can execute that jump. 









 what would happen to the current hillary....bernie....nobody else really dynamic if he entered?  









 I wouldn't say there are a "top" five, but there certainly are **T Sizzle** and **Vontaze Burfict**. You have **Brock Osweiler** waiting to get the nod to see what he can do. 

 




 why are punters so big? 




 the rich young should have the same burden as the non rich young 

if everyone had access to medicare then it would be fair 

why doesn't the GOP try to win younger voters? if I was voting for my own personal interest, I'd be happy to opt out of social security, so why doesn't the GOP call for that?  




 I don't understand how the cap still stands today. Get rid of it!

 Mayweather gets most of the money made in his fights. Dana White and the Fajita brothers get most of the money in UFC fights. 




 Guilty until proven innocent bruh.  




 **Triple threat match**: Velasquez, Miocic,   Browne.  




 They're selfish and hoping to get something for themselves in her administration. The biggest disappointment was Howard Dean, a true progressive, endorsing corporate Hillary.  




 moving up from beating down his wife? 




 1/8 doesn't count 




 who is giving him NH and Iowa? we'll have to see what kind of shape he is going into and coming out of march 1 super tuesday

 Bernie Sanders will never be president. 

If he wins the democratic primary, I bet you he will be. 




 I love KFC, original recipe.  




 Agents are for suckers. Just hire a lawer and pay them per hour rather than a percentage cut. Hire firms to get you outside deals for a lot less.

 coupled with what? free education, ok 

but all things being equal? that could be problematic  




 she reminds me of a long lost friend who i could spend all night with just talking 




 I think so too!  




 she's nutty, michael is more insecure  




 Jenna is more fake/acting imo. 









 Agreed.  




 If you ain't got the dime, she ain't got the time.

This is unfortunately not unique among most politicians. 









 And if pigs fly... 




 Bernie knows he'll need a lot of help in congress to get things done.  




 If he fought on CBS, his next fight on PPV could break his own PPV record.  




 they can't comprehend that someone won't sell out 




 could be worse 




 Look at her top campaign contributors. That's why I don't trust her. Yes, she's better than any republican, but that's not enough.
 




 Great video! I would love to see more of these made! 





























 that's what they want 




 A time traveling Hilldawg didn't do that?  


































 How: Sanders has had a long career where he has maintained the same positions. Obama had a short political career before ascending to the White House.  




 exactly 




 the haters are growing so Sanders must be doing something right

 Hillary will continue the corporate takeover that Bill and George and Barack pushed. Bernie would step on the brakes and things would get very interesting.

 That's like an average NBA player nowadays. 














 you mean fox's 24/7 coverage of benghazi and her emails have some effect? 









 all things being equal, money talks in political elections  




 seriously!  









 her hundreds of millions of dollars and yes  men probably make her feel pretty safe 




 In Hillary world they do. 




 I have heard others say this before so not first. 




 That's what it seems like. 




 We know Sanders. We didn't know Obama. If anyone is going to remain loyal to his campaign, it's  Bernie Sanders.

 they need to rethink their values 




 They are the people who vote against their own economic interests thinking they too will be rich one day when in reality they won't be.  
























 The NEA is the nation's largest teachers union, with 3 million members.

That's a lot of votes up for grabs.  














 I bet there is a goldmine somewhere, but if the movies work for you then you're good. 




 Thank you. I would be very curious to see what he does end up making, if we ever find out. 




 Michael Jordan didn't need to front.  




 Do you not live in a major city? Yeah, it can be pricey.  




 I believe you. All the hooters and buffalo wild wings where I live have a lot of bad clientele too. It's all about finding the right place for you.
