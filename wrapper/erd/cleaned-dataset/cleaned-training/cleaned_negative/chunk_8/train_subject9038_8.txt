 There will be no question in my post. I just wanted to share that you Mr. Schwarzenegger inspired me to start fitness   bodybuilding. I was a newcomer to fitness and was searching for articles on the web and saw something like: Arnold Schwarzenegger - Mr. Olympia. I opened the page because... well I have grown with your movies, because my father always watched action movies and yeah terminator predator true lies (hope I'm not mistaking the name it's been a long time since I watched that movie which reminds me of downloading the soundtrack). Anyways back to the topic: so I saw a picture of your body from one of the competitions and said: if that man did it I can do it too. I was like you when you saw the picture or Reg Park. And I started reading your bio. Then bought the new encyclopedia of modern bodybuilding and yeah you can guess how it continues. Also wanted to tell you that you are not only an inspiration but you are the perfect example of a person who reached his goals in life (and is still reaching). I have learned a lot. 
I will never forget one sentence: "You can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets."
Thank you for everything :) 




 How did you make your Asura look so cool? :D 




 Hey your Sylvari looks amazing :D. I like the colours and everything.  I too have a Sylvari. Made him a week ago. It's almost the same as the Sylvari Guardian look you get when you create your character for the first time. But yet again - love those colours of yours
