 It bothers me that it doesn't bother me more. 




 I'll be sure to remember that the next time someone tells me I should raped by a pack of niggers.

Here's a little more light reading.

http://gawker.com/5582644/all-the-terrible-things-mel-gibson-has-said-on-the-record 




 It means nothing that a celebrated actor is racist, homophobic, anti-semtic and violent? 




 He pled no contest to misdemeanour battery. So there's at least one person he hurt.

Polanski is scumbag and deserves prison.

Broderick was in a car accident 30 years ago. The family of the victim forgave him. Hardly the same thing.

I agree that Gibson was great to watch but he has ruined his own career. It is no one's fault but him.

 




 /s ?

 




 Repeating the things that actually happened and are on the official court records? 

Events that there are audio recordings of? 

The Gibson freely admits happened?
 




 Pictures of well dressed tall/fat/skinny/short/hunchback/neckless guys and why they look good.

 




 Portal 




 They forgave the first half-dozen fuck ups. But even Hollywod has limits. 

 




 Mel Gibson has show extraordinary hate and vitriol towards everyone from African-Americans to the gay community.
He threatened his wife and pled no contest to a  battery charge. He's an alcoholic, self-destructive, megalomaniac shit of a man. 

But sure, blame the Jews.

 




 In smaller communities, the scammers need to go undetected and run scams in which the victim is unaware they have been taken for a ride.

One of the criteria that con artists seek out is situations in which their victims are compelled to trust them. For example, older people are scammed more often than younger people not because they are gullible but, as you age and become more separated from your community, you need to trust others more.

A canny con man could very easily take advantage of the levels of trust that are necessarily built up in small communities. 

For example, if there is only one butcher in town, you're less likely to question the quality and source of his meat.

 After years of wearing shitty suits that don't fit I've got a nice suit that works with my body shape and complexion. 

Any suggestions for ties, pocket squares and shirts?

EDIT: I'm a speaker on the subject of con artists, scams and deception. I'm happy to look a little eccentric.

 I wrote an article a few years for a magazine about the Spanish prisoner and how it has evolved as technology has evolved. 

The earliest versions of the scam, which dates back 500 years, was much the same as today. The con man needs to rescue a spanish prisoner held prisoner with her vast fortune in a foreign land. If you'll pay for the rescue mission, the money and the girl are yours.

Check out this short story from 100 years ago.

 Fuck yes.

The night racing looks great.
 




 I like it but could never carry it off myself.

You need skinny legs and/or jeans to make that work, otherwise you'll end up looking like you're in a cacoon. 




 Check out windsor smith in Preston for cheaper brown boots. 

I'm pretty rough on my shoes and I find WS are a good halfway in terms of price vs. quality. 




 I just spent two hours at Doncaster trying to find a jumper.

Do you have a big head or broad shoulders? If so, you can stretch out jumpers real quick. 




 




 I like it. The colour is great and it looks well constructed. It does look a little like a handbag in the photo.

 Just to be clear, we're talking about the twin raping his brother's wife. 




 The thread was actually about a weird anime where the actors were told to say whatever the hell they wanted.

Sad thing is, if I had them, I would have eaten them.

Nope. Nope. Nope. 









 Think about it this way, you were the pioneer, you beat the tracks and built the roads of bad behaviour that your 14 year old brother is now the recipient of.

Every fight you had with your parents, every time they panicked because they had no one what they were doing, it was making your siblings life a little easier.

Don't be angry, be pleased you could make your parent and brother's live's easier in the future. 

You're the Johnny Appleseed of families.  




 They're fantastic films but none are ground breaking. 
  




 All great films! But none of those films are ground-breaking or exciting though.

Sixth sense is a classic premise done really well, Toy Story 2 is sequel and green mile is shawshank redemption with magic. 

Good solid films in a dull year.
 




 1999.

We had Fight Club, American Beauty and The Matrix but, while fantastic, none of those films are particularly ground breaking. 

The year was also packed full of films by filmmakers who had done better. Phantom Menace, Eyes Wide Shut, The Spy Who Shagged Me, Tarzan, The World Is Not Enough, Notting Hill....

1999 was a year for playing it safe, limping to end of the lackluster nineties.

Also, Wild Wild West.


 




 Too late!

 Aw thanks! 









 It's my wedding anniversary tomorrow. Thought I'd take my wife to see llamas. 

Chicks dig llamas. 
 




 They flowered a little last spring hence my interest in them. Only a few flowers.

A few bulbs snapped off so I'm trying my luck in the garden with the rest of my winter bulbs. (I'm in Australia and it's autumn) 




 Thanks! We found a half dozen of them when we moved into our new house. They've been sitting down the back of the garden for two years 




 They're dead right down to the roots. I can cut off the dead leaves but then I'm left with dead stalks right down low. 









 I'm performing in Guinea Pigs at Melbourne International Comedy Festival. 

We've had great crowds and great reviews (Here's one: http://www.melbartsfash.com/109918) until now but, on Tuesday night we've got the Herald Sun coming in.

For some reason, people actually read the Herald Sun reviews so we'd like to stack the deck with our kind of crowd. 

Check out the description below and, if it tickles you, hit me up in my inbox for a free double pass.

http://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2014/season/search?q=Jonestown submit=

EDIT: We had over fifty responses and all the tickets are gone! Thanks! However, please feel free to send me a message anyway in case we need to paper the room on any other nights. If you'd like to come on Tuesday night anyway, it is tight arse Tuesday and tickets are already super cheap.

EDIT 2: Thank you so much to everyone who came. We had a full house in the end which was fantastic. We even had two guide dogs in the front row. https://www.facebook.com/GuideDogZeke?fref=ts
 




 Yeah, not great.  




 Thanks. I like to keep in short because it grows so fast. When it gets just a little longer, I look really bald. Like here.

 We've used them a couple of times. They're great for sick kids as you don't wait long. 




 I can recommend this guy. He's very funny.  




 That's exactly what I thought.

 




 I know that both percent or per cent are correct but what about 'per centage'?

The in-house style guide insists on per cent.

Should I also use per centage? 

EDIT: Just to provide more context, this is in a piece of dialogue in a second novel. In the first book, the publisher used per cent. The word percentage did not occur.  




 Phew! I find going to the movies and seeing non-white people very uncomfortable.

The original story is set in Europe and draws from European history, politics, landscape and architecture.

The titans stride through cobblestone streets between Georgian houses and buildings, smashing churches. By making the characters Japanese, a lot of what made the series unique gets lost.

Do you think the film could suffer in the same way The Last Airbender suffered?




 




 It was tonight!

But we're doing another one Sunday at 4:30 on Northcote. 




 Getting your joke is the first time I've used my English major in years.  




 If you're free tomorrow night (Thursday) and love comedy that is half-baked and under-rehearsed, we'd love you to be in the audience for the test show of our sketch comedy show.

It is at 6:30 in Collingwood. 

Send me a message if you're keen!

Not cost at all, just your honest opinion.

 I agree, but viewership doesn't mean successful in the same way for Netflix as it does on network TV.

An original show offers Netflix prestige, publicity and air of quality that 20 year old repeats won't. 



 









 I got to Northside as well. I'm straight and have had nothing but great experiences.  




 Dammit. Why don't I read the comments before I watch these trailers?

 




 You'll probably be disturbed by the whole show then... 









 I have and continue to do so.

But I'm referring to a rapist who has managed to escape justice and who regrets his actions. 

If a person is truly remorseful, I would imagine they would want to make up for what they did.

 It is a web series but check out The Katering Show on YouTube. 




 Brooklyn 99 is getting better. It's progression reminds me a lot of Parks and Rec in the first two seasons. 




 When it first came out, a lot of reviewers missed the satire and thought it was a serious film. 

It is only in hindsight that people see the film for what it is.

He has similar problems with Robocop and Showgirls.

 I'm in Australia and Starbucks failed here.

Our population is made up of a lot of european migrants who insisted on good coffee when they came here in the 50s and 60s. 

I have to admit I struggled to find coffee the way I like it in the US. I think Americans drink their coffee weaker than other countries, but drink more of it. 

I loved the jugs of drip coffee at the gas stations with the racks of syrups and creamers (I still don't know what that stuff is). 

 









 Congratulations!  




 Titantic is too manipulative to make me cry.

 What's great about his performance in Episodes is that while he is a prick, it's still a nuanced and interesting character. You end up feeling sorry for him.  




 In the Worlds before Monkey,
Primal chaos reigned, Heaven sought order.
But the Phoenix can fly only when its feathers are grown.
The four worlds formed again and yet again,
As endless aeons wheeled and passed.
Time and the pure essences of Heaven,
The moistures of the Earth,
And the powers of the Sun and the Moon
All worked upon a certain rock - old as Creation,
And it magically became fertile.
That first egg was named Thought,
Tathagata Buddha, the Father Buddha,
Said, 'With our thoughts we make the world.'
Elemantal forces caused the egg to hatch,
from it then came a stone Monkey.
The nature of Monkey was irrepressable! 




 I'm looking forward to him in Community. 




 The pears. Oh god, the pears. 




 I've never seen Bosom Buddies. That looks amazing. 




 My favourite has to be Renegade:

*He was a cop, and good at his job. But he committed the ultimate sinand testified against other cops gone bad. Cops that tried to kill him, but got the woman he loved instead. Framed for murder, now he prowls the badlands...an outlaw hunting outlaws...a bounty hunter...a RENEGADE.*

 Just checked out the trailer. Looks harrowing. 




 ooh! Nice one. I realised the other day that Nolan's films, with a few exceptions, are actually getting worse as he goes on but I never noticed because he set the bar so high at the start of his career. 




 So far, I can think of Cube, Saw, Oldboy, Exam, Captivity, Killing Room and Unknown.

Most in the genre are pretty terrible low budget efforts but I'm sure there is some gold out there like Cube. 




 I dunno. You're pretty far away from me and I find you REALLY annoying. 

Same goes for phones.
