 10 Videos That Will Cure Cancer In The Sub. Will It Stop Redditors From Posting Low Quality Material? You'll Never Believe The Answer! 




 It wouldn't be funny at all. A tight weave on a basket (required to make that symbol using just the weaving) would be a sign of great craftsmanship. It would mean either you are very good at weaving yourself, or you were able to get others to do it for you. 




 To be fair, the articles in Playboy can be very interesting. 




  The seemingly never-ending streams of penis pudding emanating from his piss pipe soon had me coated like a plasterer's radio. When he removed his disco stick from my puckered brown eye, he was pleasantly surprised to see a footlong fudge bullet staring back as him. He knew I couldn't wait to gobble the stink pickle off his bugger king. The mixture of corn-eyed butt snake and penis pudding in my turd-herder created the delicious rectoplasm that he was so fond of. He rolled a giant toilet twinkie on my breasticles just so he could consume it up like a hungry hungry hippo. With his greasy slimelight fucking deep into my quim, the sensation of his greasy slimelight smashing my cervix made me quake like a tasered slab of chopped liver.

This generator is beyond awesome. 




 If you want a good conflict for a BDSM story, how about having some scenes where he realizes that he is going too far.

It might change the tone of your work, but it would be a relatable conflict for the readers, who (let's face it) probably don't understand BDSM. 




 Except for the cards themselves.

They just didn't do anything to prevent two people from using the same codes. 




 My personal theory is that the symbol was so common because it naturally forms as a result of basketweaving. 




 If this was a dad joke, then it should be bad joke eel. 




 Provide evidence directly from the source materials, please. Because no one else is seeing it. 




 Okay... let me educate you.

A good theory would be something along the lines of "Willy Wonka puts acid in his chocolate" that uses evidence like the trippy, weird interactions that the people encounter in the factory (which they don't normally feel because the effects are lessened greatly after the chocolate is cooked, formed, and shipped). Or maybe that Oz is another dimension of Earth, and that explains why the Wizard looks exactly like the kindly carney that Dorothy met before going there.

This is just... "hey, they both walk on something red" 




 Where is the evidence?

There is zero evidence outside of the story that you made up.

Beyond the timeframe and setting of the "real world" (Depression Era America), and the idea of little people who make candy, there is nothing to indicate the Wonka stepped foot in Oz.

More damning to your theory is the idea that the Red Brick Road, seen in Oz, somehow leads past the Deadly Desert to a place in America... because the Chocolate Factory is clearly not in Oz, due to the large number of people that gathered for the Golden Ticket event.

But there is no evidence that Wonka's father was the Wizard of Oz, nor that the Wonkavator was an Oz construct of any kind.  




 Banning an app from the app store is like deciding not to sell a book at Barnes and Noble.

You are still free to sell on Amazon.

Similarly, you can still publish your app onto other stores, including migrating to a different device.  




 This is one quote, one fact, that can (almost) never be reposted enough.

If we remember nothing else from history, no other lesson learned, no other mistake, remember that *when you burn books, people will follow* 




 Isn't that rubbing penises together?  




 He means the "catcher" 




 Power refers to being in control.

Bottom refers to being the catcher in a pitcher/catcher relationship.

It means that you like taking it up the ass more than giving it up the ass, and at the same time initiate intimate activity. 




 She watched Pirates of the Caribbean one too many times  




 You tell them that you were a victim of a scam, that you were convinced to compromising yourself on video and were being blackmailed for increasing amounts of money.

You contacted them originally via Skype, so you have some of their Skype information. You have the phone number they used to contact you, even if it was falsified. You have the information they used to contact you by email and send them the money.

You won't ever see that money again, I'm sorry. But every piece of information the authorities receive, the more likely they will be able to catch them. 




 I'm assuming, because even with it being anonymous, Omegle can find his IP and get it to authorities. 




 The police can't do anything. No jurisdiction.

This matter goes to the FBI, where there have an ongoing task force with Interpol. 




 I'm wondering whether Stranger was trolling, too... 




 To be fair, the last workplace was never making assertions that she be called Chairman Pao. 




 The only real difference is if she stepped down now, or on her own time...

When people react to "I'm sorry" with "Okay, when are you resigning?", it is clear that she isn't going to last much longer anyway. 




 What he is describing is "a rabble".

 Specifically, making lifestyle changes will affect the people who are around you. If you hang around with weaker, less fit people, you are more likely to encounter weaker genetics (people who are genetically predisposed to health problems and obesity, for example). If you hang around at the gym more, you are more likely to encounter healthier genetics (people with higher metabolisms and less propensity to health issues), resulting in stronger offspring.

If you raise your children to have the same habits, they will similarly meet stronger, healthier individuals on average, further strengthening your line. In that way, even if you hit the genetic short straw (and marry a woman who used to be 500 pounds and worked her ass off to fit into a size 3 dress), your children are more likely to make a healthy genetic match. 




 Not 100%, but it doesn't look good. 




 I've had people offer, but I never take it. Why? Because they are paying to be there, and sleeping with them makes me a whore.

 I saw the gif as a way of showing the before and after in a tongue in cheek manner.

 Angleine. 




 Most of the time, they don't project themselves with a wholesome, family image. Tom Cruise doesn't play a loving and successful husband and father who takes time for his children and never so much as goes away on a business trip for the weekend. Samuel L Jackson doesn't portray himself as a kindly man who doesn't cuss and would rather give you a stern talking to instead of a spanking.

If this was Eddie Murphy that was accused, we probably wouldn't bat an eye about watching Beverly Hills Cop.

But if Dave Collier were to have this level of accusations, maybe they'd stop showing Full House for a while. 




 He said in the deposition that it was for the women he intended to have sex with. His lawyers stopped him from answering any further.

I'm not saying "lynch him", but maybe I don't want to give him any more of my money.

And I was a big fan of his, since I was a kid. I watched Fat Albert, and the Cosby Show, and his stand up specials. Even as a white kid, he was a hero. Someone who was successful, and didn't let that success go to his head... and now, I just don't believe it anymore. 




 You'd have to pick a character of the same caliber as Speedy...

Try this one.

 Sooner or later, you'll need to know that. 




 37...

37 false charges.

I hate to say it, especially with him admitting to buying a recreational drug for use on women that puts you to sleep, it isn't hard to distrust the man now.

Yes, some of the accusations are less than criminal (one that accused him of forcing a kiss didn't say that he raped her), but they still hold to a pattern of behavior that screams "I'm a rapist." 




 I always "loved" his pronunciation of "cubby".

But the biggest shortcuts I can recommend are to make multiple reservations one at a time (select the first reservation and "insert" and it will copy name, address, phone, email, notes, and credit card, leaving you to enter the checkin/checkout dates), and have tech support's number on speed dial.

The system slows down like nothing else, as it searches through *every hotel's entire history* to pull up any information. Sunday mornings are the absolute worst, as every active hotel is checking out a total of millions of guests.

If you have access to manager's tools, you can cut off reservation lines or change rates, but you'll still want to mostly get direction from the boss on doing it, and you can reset passwords for your coworkers.

One hidden function of SoftHotel is the ability to change room types for an uneditable reservation (SOE, SOO, and other third party reservations that shouldn't be modified normally). Go into the Room View screen (F2), and click the button right next to the room number field. Select the new room type and assign a room, and it will force the system to accept the change.  




 So was Speedy. 




 Yes, but how many decades?

20 years ago were were talking about global floods happening today. But can anyone clearly state how much of the increases are directly caused by mankind, and how much of the increases are natural? Can anyone give an accurate prediction of 20-40 years from now?  I'm not convinced they can.

 But really, I'm not even against most of the stuff on the global warming movement.

Solar energy, wind and water energy, nuclear and geothermal energy... electric cars, ion propulsion, space-based shipyards... the whole gamut of science fiction is within grasp to become science fact, and we can't be bothered with arguments over *why we want them to come about*. 




 I would assume that in the case of a polyamorous marriage, the one that divorces would receive an equal share of the belongings.

For a 3-person marriage, she would get 1/3. 




 I was going to offer to sell you this one before you changed the comment. 




 He's talking about that fact that you can make 100s of orders of nuggets a day, so you are giving away a not unnoticeable amount of chicken. They have to be wondering why your store is selling 120 6-pieces, but ordering as if you sold 140. 




 So, you're the piece of shit that always runs out of my chicken mcnuggets!

Imma call 911 on your ass! 




 You see what your problem is? I ask an honest question (how can they tell the difference between the enexorable change in the climate caused by natural forces and the preventable change in climate caused by man's activity, especially when both are occurring at the same time?), and get accused of being an idiot or a liar.

You aren't winning any popularity contests by acting this way, and frankly it's the best way to take someone who is open minded enough to listen and close them to you.

Just some food for thought.

But when you accuse a layman, a hotel front desk clerk, of being bought and paid for by a shadowy anti-environmental conspiracy, I hope you aren't linking to any sort of group that makes money on the climate movement. (I'll check the link out later.) 




 Well, depending on the size of safe and the type of explosive... That seal might not matter.

The pressure cookers worked as a fuse for the bomb, allowing them to set it and get away. For a safe-bomb, they'd use a timer. 




 They'll probably adapt it for an episode of SVU. 




 I'm still confused as to how they can tell the difference between anthropogenic and natural climate change.

The Earth goes through cycles of warming and cooling, resulting in the growth and recession of glaciers. Geologically, we are in a warming period that will end with deglaciation, and rising sea levels, regardless of mankind's effect on the environment.

This means we can delay such effects, at best, and not stop them. And we could even do more harm to the planet by trying to stop the natural order. 




 I'm gonna hit them with my Sac.... ajawea coins.

 Interesting... And amazing that he doesn't even know the comedian's name...

But does anyone really think that they are going after Bill Cosby because of racism?

The same people that helped him *earn* all his money from his long and storied career? Co-stars, guests, models, writers, agents, personal assistants, comedy club owners... It's either the greatest conspiracy in entertainment history since the Communist Blacklist, or he's guilty. 




 Seriously, if you want more exposure for your music, segregate it from the toxic exposure to this account.

If people are down voting you because you are you, then you need to start fresh. Keep the J2501 account for MR, and keep MR off the new music account (which you should name after the band) 




 Thank you for that. I didn't know Newsweek did that shit. 




 You might be right there. But it still looks really bad. 




 Fucking news outlets, right? 

The story is pretty much the headline, though.  




 Now *that's* a hack job. 




 Shame on a man with long hair. Except Samson. 




  older final fantasy games

Every game before FF6 had party sizes of 4 or 5.

 You said yourself that you had $5,000 cash when you graduated.

When I graduated, I had nothing. I signed up for the Air Force, but ultimately I didn't qualify. Being in boot camp only part of the way screwed me up more than you'd believe.

These 9 years of working a shitty, low paying job are probably the best thing for my resume, since I can now claim management experience.

I'm happy for you having the opportunity to do this "right", but if you weren't allowed to work during high school, or if your plans got pulled out from under you, then it gets **real hard** to even keep an upbeat attitude.

But, yes. When I hear people bitch and moan because they only make $15-20/hr... they could be doing so much worse.

And even *I'm* lucky to be working 40 hrs a week, so I could be doing so much worse. 




 Come on, son! 




  Classic - Cowboy Bebop

Yeah, no... You lost points with that. I'm not saying the show is bad, but it is not the "classic" anime.

The basic problem with the chart is that it oversimplifies some sections and over complicates others. I would say that a website version of this with less humor and more thought would be better for recommendations. 




 [](/ppshrug) I didn't follow most of the chat about this show, so when I had the realization that there were too many parallels to Fight Club, I posted this. 




 According to most Christian denominations' dogma, Jesus Christ is Yahweh/God in human form.

Christianity is literally the following or worship of Christ. 




 I wish it were that simple. 




 I put in a test pattern in the program, and told it to make an order... $11.95 is what it came up with. Forgive me, I don't have the exact numbers of colors, etc. related to it.

I may have underestimated the time aspect, but that only makes it *more* expensive to make and sell these for profit.

Ultimately, I want to make a profit. I want to do art that will sell to others, and not just spend money on a hobby.

The individual price point is low enough, I can probably make a single order to see if I find them easier to work with, but it is apparent that I would be selling them for higher prices than Perler sprites. 




 That is probably my biggest problem.

And, that kills my chances. 




 We don't all have the option. Some of us aren't even allowed to work during the school year. 




 White kid didn't get to do anything on that final round... 




 I got to see a taping of that show, at least. 




 This is true, but everywhere else in this area is starting to move to $10... I could push carts for Walmart for more than I'm making now (but the hours are probably less, so it'd be a wash.) 




 It is based on certain "bare minimum" values, like the cheapest efficiency apartment in my area is about $525 a month.

I think that the minimum wage should simply be *that* value. The minimum hourly pay for a single person, living alone, on bare essentials (the calculation does include a small amount extra for things like clothes, saving, or emergency, though it isn't enough for a retirement fund) if he works a full 40 hour week each week.

If you want to start a family, you should go look for a better job. But a single person shouldn't be struggling to make ends meet with a full time job. 




 No, that probably is part of the problem, but I can't even afford the 2 year IT degree right now. I certainly can't afford to quit this job without another one lined up and waiting.

For those of you reading this, and haven't yet fallen into the work trap... get your degree. But it isn't so easy when you're 35 and don't make enough.

I think your downvotes were caused by the flippant attitude about it. 




 I literally watched him make this realization. He didn't know until recently. 




 I started at my last job at $6.25, 9 years ago. I was bumped up to $7.50 over the course of 5 years (mostly due to the minimum wage increase from $5.35 to $7.25).

I moved to this current job 4 years ago, starting at $7.75, and now make $8.50.

The 8 year price increase comment comes about from a realization that my boss had very recently. He bought a case of ice buckets for the rooms. The same price he paid for them 8 years ago, but only half the quantity.

If I can get him to understand that the prices are going up for everything, maybe, just maybe, he'll understand that my $8.50/hr isn't as great a wage as he thinks.  




 No family member would support me to that level. Any apprenticeship I do would have to pay me at least what I'm making now. 




 It partly depends on the date of your wedding.

We get idiots that want to guarantee an early check-in on July 4th weekend. 




 Don't forget SkillsUSA 




 Nothing. They did it for me.

I straight up failed the hearing, vision, and calesthenics tests. 




 What many don't realize is that $16/hr is far more than double $8.50... why? Because your rent stays mostly the same. Your cell phone, your cable, your gaming might go up a little. But where you *used to have* $20 extra a paycheck, you now have $200. 




 $400 an hour? Lawyer? 




 *sigh*

Tried that. Discharged during Boot Camp "EPTE". 




 I've thought about that, but I'm not a big fan of P2W DLC. 




 I'm fairly conservative regarding wages, and while I do agree that the minimum wage of $7.25/hr is probably too low, we should have the minimum wage be based on local areas, and not nationwide.

$10 is good in my smallish city, but it is worthless in NYC. If we raised the national minimum wage to reflect New York's economy, it would simply be too much, and would wreak havoc on the economy. 




 That can be true, but my boss deciding to raise my wage won't affect my cost of living (hotel desk clerk). But him *not* raising my wage will, since everyone else is. 




 We don't have too many factories here. There is the Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola bottling plants... 




 $10.01 is the MIT calculated Living Wage for a single adult living alone in this area.

I'd be relatively happy at that rate (maybe a little higher)... But the "best" jobs in the area here used to be $15...

Mind you, I'm 34, and have been doing this job for longer than any other job I've had. It's practically my career.

I can't just job hop to something lower, just because of the pay. I have to find something in my wheelhouse that will pay better, or find a way to make *this* job pay better. 




 Hotel front desk.

It is so tempting to go to Walmart and push carts for $10, but I don't want my resume to show Call Center - Front Desk - Assistant Manager - Bagboy. 




 My boss isn't so brain dead that he won't give raises, but they are few and far between.

I think he just doesn't understand that prices have gone up over the past 8 years. 




 Most states don't actually allow that. They're legally required to pay every minute you work. 




 It pisses my $8.50/hr off to hear people nonchalantly talking about $14-15... 




 And I thought breaking up by text was low... to break up with a meme... 




 My brother and his wife used to stream PS4 footage, but had to stop because of issues. (He's on restriction.)

I've tried streaming before, but I never know what to say, especially when there is zero audience. 




 I can understand how a person's feelings of confusion could lead to a depraved alley. 




 A dog is not recognized as a sentient creature. More importantly, it can not actively communicate consent with mankind.

The only retard here is you, man.

Just admit it. You don't want gays to marry, because you think butt sex is icky.

Edit - I will correct myself on a particular error, as my "field of study" is science fiction and not philosophy. Dogs are not *sapient* creatures, that is we can not reason with them. The fact that they can not legally consent is the most important reason we can not have sex with them, still. 




 http://imgur.com/gallery/1e7xIzn 




 Yes, actually.

If a dog were to be recognized as a sentient creature, and it were to communicate its desire and consent to sexual congress, as well as the committed, lifetime relationship with a human being, then they can be married. 




 Wait... the "bible-thumper" is arguing for gay marriage? And the atheist is against? Something is fishy there.

But anyway, marriage is a social construct that says that two people will be together for the rest of their lives, and thus enjoy certain rights, responsibilities, and privileges based on that promise.

Maternity wards are medical centers designed to help deliver children, not a social construct.

You drew the parallel to bestiality, necrophilia, and paedophilia, when you argued that gays "can't be married," just like one can't marry "a goat, a corpse, or a child" because you can't mate with them.

As for the right of the goat to consent... yes. If we are able to formally communicate, two-way, with a different species, then yes... we should be allowed to marry it if we want, even if we can't conceive.

Of age to mate can be as young as 9 or 10. The age of consent is based on the generally accepted age to grant consent (based on the ability to sign a contract). 




 One point of order.

Children can conceive relatively young, but it is highly dangerous. But if mating is your only concern, then man/child may be viable.

Beyond that, what about marriages among the infertile? The elderly? Or even marriages that don't want children?

If mating and procreation was the end-all beat-all, then a huge number of marriages aren't valid. 




 The dog can't legally consent.

Gay people have rights. 




 I'm a horrible person, I was hoping the balcony would collapse. 




 Much more similar than this, but it was more of a feeling of being like it actually sounding like it, you know.

I got into the same kind of mood listening to it.
