 Bonus points if it also offers the file comparison button in Windows copy operations if the target name is already taken.

Seriously, HOW RETARDED is the default infrastructure we've all been putting up with for decades!?

1) A binary file comparison doesn't take relevant time in most cases. But instead of at least offering this feature, Windows shows us file dates and sizes. "Hooman, it is YOUR job to do the numbers leg work. I am the computah, I don't do such things!"

2) Clicking "Save" if a file already exists presents you with an annoying "Are you sure?" window that *you can not abort with ESC!*

 Where did you ever get that speed figure? That would be 232,461 km/s, the speed of light being 299,792 km/s. 




 Reminds me that I once read an SF story where a ship was, I think, exploring a parallel universe. The space they popped up in had curious properties, which the crew eventually realized. After some pondering of what was going on (especially regarding the *ongoing change* of those properties), they understood that they were somewhere inside the birth process of a gigantic star, so they obviously ran the fuck away. 




 I can't read this in any other way (e.g. funny) than that you really mean it, which would be an extremely sad will to have, to say it mildly.

 TL;DR:

 The choices you make in Telltale games have limited consequences for the plot, its true. But they have massive consequences for the characterization and theme, which is something few other games offer. Theres more to stories than plot, after all.

and

 Letting players pick their own morals is something Telltales games have in common with Edgar Allan Poes stories. [...] Poe thought it was better for writers to focus on creating effect (if he was writing today hed probably have said feels), and thats what Telltales games achieve 5. Forcing us to focus on why we make characters do things brings us closer to them. [...] By giving players control not over the plot but over the context that plot happens in, the choices become meaningful in the most literal sensethey let you alter the meaning of the story. Thats a rare thing in video games, and worth recognizing.

 Is it Amazing like the Bible is Holy? Or is it amazing? 




 Let's look at the amount of evil, destruction, and suffering in the world *on average*, meaning "divided by the amount of living people".

I am pretty sure that the history of mankind is a more or less steadily descending graph in this regard, these years having *the lowest* value so far.

But you know what. Ask people what they think how many people live on Earth right now. I am convinced many will not know or give a vastly wrong (and in most cases wrong = much too low) estimate. *BECAUSE* of this, they don't form the above thought in their heads. Instead, they have the *highest* exposure to news about negative events in the world in the history of mankind, because of how densely networked the world is etc.

Just FYI: http://www.census.gov/popclock/ 7,256,259,300 (now ,330) is the current estimate.

A person confronted with this should realize: End times? Maybe the end of suffering, but not the end of the world. 




 I'm not shitting you: I hate holidays, and whenever they come up, I as a German can say: "Fucking Christians!"

 That's why I said that *reality* happens slower, not "your clocks tick slower" or something like that. One must understand that all changes (length contraction, time dilation, ... well, that's them) are not an *apparent effect*, but they are *the reality*, and it's not more or less valid than any "other" reality in space. 




 Hollywood is often horrible at actually portraying a person's inner process ("I'm a boy bitten by a spider. This morning, I am awesome, my whole body has changed! So, what's for breakfast?"), and also, it's hard to express the complex problem of will and submission of will and interaction of will on the high abstract level that is required to understand BDSM. It's not only hard, but mankind as a whole is also too immature, the people's knowledge of the most important thing - *their own will* - is devastatingly underdeveloped. 




 This is the second comment I see that says just this. Linking to the user, not to the comment. Face. Palm.

That's actually ... baffling. Why was there no official subreddit called /r\/MonetizeReddit or something, where suggestions (sometimes of astonishingly high value, haha pun) would have accumulated over *years*?

That's, like, the weirdest neglect that could possibly have happened. Meaning that I expect someone to reply with an actual subreddit that did that.

 The reason I think like I described isn't just based on things I've seen/read on the Net (We don't have much obvious religious insanity in Germany.), it's half or mostly based on the mind set that I suspect (and see as causal) behind both beliefs (YEC/Hell). (I just tried to type out a description of it, but all sentences came out wrong. Somethingsomething deeply religious, magical reality, ...)

Wow, thought that would be the [FIFA movie](https://np.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/391z8s/fifas_29_million_feature_film_has_607_boxoffice/). Everybody says it's crap, but additionally, this was the official pitch (emphasis mine):

 Once football was all about small boys in the park, jumpers for goalposts. Rush goalie. Two at the back, three in the middle, four up front. Passion, fun, enjoyment. This is the story of the men who took football from that and changed it. **A group of wholly honest and deeply ethical men** who had a dream and, to achieve that dream, established the Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Driven by their determination to lead football into a brighter, bigger future, **the trustworthy and wholly honest Sepp Blatter**, Jules Rimet, and Joao Havelange overcame their doubts and fought obstacles and scandals to make FIFA and the World Cup a reality. Spanning the tumultuous 20th Century, this timeless saga will tell **the story of how an organization currently mired in entirely unsubstantiated accusations of scandal and corruption** started their journey to that destination. 




 "*the* beef" would have flowed better, imho. 




 Personally, I would just take a number and count upwards. "1", eventually "34", eventually "3431" etc.

It keeps things simple and prevents confusion, e.g. you won't have someone confusing 1.xx with 2.xx stuff or people thinking that 2.0 comes after 1.9 etc.

If *you*, the game developer, are struggling with the concept of version numbers, why are simple users expected to put up with major.minor.revision.build stuff? I never understood that. The only downside to this is that milestones aren't as clear as "2.0 is out!" - but need they be? You'll have to push out a 2.1 and 2.2 or 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 anyway, and the people will have to know that. So, where was the simplification again?

It's a so well-disproved argument that you must be new at this. Welcome to the party. Maybe read a few FAQs or something. 




 It's also not quite humble to tell the world that you know God's will. People who do that do not believe in God *or* are insane. Blasphemy, slander - only bad if it hurts the people's religious feelings, but fuck God, right. Must be true believers :P 




 B-side: "The penis. Mightier than the sword." 




 Yes. 




  "Little Boy" bomb [...] Hiroshima [...] it used so much Uranium (60 kg)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy

 When 1 pound (0.45 kg) of uranium-235 undergoes complete fission, the yield is 8 kilotons. The 16 kiloton yield of the Little Boy bomb was therefore produced by the fission of no more than 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of uranium-235, out of the 141 pounds (64 kg) in the pit.

So, it was 64 kg, not 60.

But I have a question, which was the reason I looked that up at all: The text implies that 70.5 times the amount needed for the yield of 16 KT was in the bomb. Using all of it would hence have resulted in a yield of about 1.128 megatons.

The question: With current best bomb technology, how high a percentage of that very uranium could we have turned into *actual* yield? Bonus: Was the effective yield of Little Boy as expected, or was there a large range of uncertainty? 




 That comeback must have spent quite some time in the centrifuges, given its purity. 




 Cosmological and other such arguments: Logic games. The universe could just be in an eternal BigBang-BigCrunch loop. It would *just exist*, just like God would *just exist*.

Majority vote: Insufficient, especially given the "If you're born here, you'll most likely become a Christian, but if you're born there ..." factor and the obviously ongoing indoctrination of children. Not to forget societal pressure.

Scripture: LOL. Thousands of interpretations of self-contradictory texts show their unreliability. And there are several such texts which contradict *each other*. While you could say that they all support the existence of God, that would only regard a small selection of texts which happened to gain a lot of traction.

Feelings/visions/etc.: Obviously insufficient. What one person interprets to confirm Jesus is another person's sense of Muhammad.

It all comes down to claims that can't be peer-reviewed or tested. So, one of the most profound claims that could exist should be accepted based on evidence you wouldn't find sufficient if someone were to sell you a bridge.

----

What are your two or three most convincing arguments that God supposedly exists, and why do you think skeptics who are not swayed by them would kind of have to explain themselves? 




  If you don't believe in it, then you must have reason not to believe in it.

So, what's your justification not to believe that *I* am God? If I can't prove it to you, it's probably not true, but you're saying that that's not sufficient not to believe it. Could you tell me what your answer would be? Almost the same answer would apply to an atheist not believing the general proposition of the existence of god(s). In case you don't think almost the same answer would work, could you point out why not?

In addition to this, let me give you a good answer for why atheists don't accept the claim: Because the level of evidence that actually exists - people having feelings, visions, near-death-experiences of the divine, or just the fact that many others believe it, too - is the same that many other claims have, e.g. the claim of abductions by aliens or for Bigfoot or for the Loch Ness monster. With such a childish epistemology, you'd have to accept all kinds of claims. Someone else called it gullibility - yep, that's exactly what it would be, especially since the claim is of utmost profoundness. Now you could say "Well, what's wrong with considering all those claims at least possible?" - But that's what the kind of atheist who just lacks a belief is doing, too! They are not excluding the possibility, they are just not in the boat. Except of course that there are good reasons not to believe in Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster, because those are rather easily falsifiable. 




 Well, the two examples are videos for me, not GIFs. 




 And OP should use a StringBuilder for this, not the regular String, because the latter creates a new object for each concatenation while the former is intended for consecutively growing strings like this. Not to be used if you just want to do one or two concats or just with little text, but otherwise it's the right choice. 




 It's important to dare to just start walking before you have learned all there is to know about walking. Nobody would be moving if they would try to become omniscient regarding their complex topic first.

I guess overbearing perfectionism is your problem. You want to know *the* path, don't want to risk not doing it right. Thing is, there are *so many* ways to do it right.

The best resource to learn will ultimately be "learning by doing", and while there are many approaches to do that, those, too, have to be investigated by doing. So, LBD will be a resource you'll stick to in the end. And from this center, you will reach out to the available resources to gain specific knowledge, which is even the best way to learn: Once you have a specific question, you are most open to understand and store the answer.

So, once you have a stable fundament (which by now you *certainly* would have), LBD plus Google are your main resources. Your fear to get lost is the main obstacle you have to overcome. Not the possibility that you could get lost - but your fear that it could happen. 




 Could you please break that wall up with a few paragraphs?

In any case: I don't consider it a slip-up to drink some alcohol after a long enough abstinence, e.g. months, as long as this remains a single incident. Of course that is quite the key problem for some. I'm saying that as long as a person has to fear to ever drink a glass or two of hard liquor ever again, the person might be safe - but the person isn't free. It should be possible to rise above that and develop a will that can freely choose. 




 What certainly can't be healthy to eat is what one of the "Dner Kebap" eateries where I live are doing: They are sharpening the large knife which they use to cut the meat from the flesh cylinder with a handheld electrical grindstone. So far so good.

But they're doing it in the room with the meat and all the ingredients (salad), usually quasi aimed at the meat. You see glowing red hot sparks flying off all the time. What are they? They are glowing red hot metal pieces which then become "invisible" because they stop glowing, but they are still metal pieces.

Even if (And that's a big if.) they "burn up" like this, you can be sure that at least some actual razor sharp metal bits land in your food. They were not fazed when I inquired about this problem. I don't eat in that place. 




 Story-time. What was going through your head when you decided to hold the camera like this? 




  they always say "some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom." but they keep saying that for thousands of years.

: 




 The principles that reality follows, which we have approximately or correctly (but partly, never describing the whole) derived in scientific laws, are apparently unchanging. Otherwise, nothing is permanent, not even Black Holes. And it is expected that eventually, in a really cosmic time-span, all structures in the universe will have fallen apart, there will be no "contrast" left, so to speak: No work can be done any more. Entropy is at a maximum. "Heat" Death. 




 So, what if God shows up in person and says: "I want you to do with your life what you want! Give it *your own* meaning. I will also not hold your hand - you can find all the information you need in reality itself."?

You would have to be frustrated, no? Because it would be no different from the atheistic situation. (Not that atheists are frustrated. Loving the truth, no matter what it is, feels better, more pure, more heroic so to speak, than following the herd into a fantasy of questionable pleasance.) 




 The guy said "lacks belief in deities", so they are not to be asked "how can you support this", instead *others* would be faced with the request to support *their* view, assuming that it is theistic.

Or, at the most, you can expect to hear: "Because I have not seen sufficient evidence. And those who claim that there is should realize that their competition religions have just the same level of evidence, yet their conclusions are vastly different. The logical conclusion is to deem the evidence insufficient." 




 That's an odd situation. What if the person is banned in some subreddits and now has to make a new account? If they start posting/commenting there, they could be banned site-wide for ban-evasion just because they forgot where exactly they are banned (or where they are commenting). Wouldn't be their fault. But since anyone could claim their account was hijacked, what choice would the admins have? 




 So, by "encourage", you don't mean to make the player do something, but you mean to make emergent behavior of the game mechanism possible/likely.

I believe that abstraction is key. A metaphoric example: Instead of implementing liquid water, ice, and steam, one should implement water and the possibility for phase changes. To allow even greater emergence: Instead of implementing water, one should implement atoms and molecules. - This is of course not practical for a computer game e.g. because of the amount of entities involved. It's supposed to show that implementing reality on higher abstraction levels allows for more emergence.

Let's translate this to Minecraft, whose emergence in regards to mob grinders I find completely fantastic, and I'm sure we'll eventually have action adventures (e.g. like Deus Ex) except with a world that is based somewhat on simulation (not just enemy-AI-simulation), so that the player can do/decide things like in Minecraft (see mob grinders). DX:HumanRevolution gave us a taste of this via their *transportable* auto-turrets.

Minecraft *could* have been different: Pre-defined finite block-worlds. Monsters only spawn in defined locations, e.g. via spawn blocks instead of just in darkness/distance. Monsters only die by player attack, are not damaged by lava, cactuses, fall-impact. Water does not affect monsters or drops. Water is only in cemented places (like rivers in Skyrim) instead of being an emergent consequence of the water mechanics and landscape.

This would have prevented the awesome that intuitive mob grinder construction is.

Instead, in Minecraft the rules apply to everybody equally. The rules themselves are hence something on a high abstraction level. Everything gets affected by water, lava, cactuses(, falling).

Successfully establishing and balancing systems on high abstraction levels should inevitably have emergent manifestations on lower abstraction levels, like in the example of Minecraft: Mob grinder possibility, interesting landscape formations, emergent situations during battles where world effects or animals surprisingly come into play, ...

I can't give you concrete examples for your RL, but maybe you can copy the spirit that I tried to express and observe that it actually works as intended: Emergent manifestations and emergent game-reality-flow.

This kind of game development is the best, because even though you develop it yourself, you're "always" faced with new experiences while testing, e.g. unexpected but appreciated behavior can take place. 




 I just wanted to point that out. You will meet the consequences later.

 The only heaven I can imagine to live in for eternity would be the universe. Anything else would not be suitable. Also, I would find the idea *horrible* not to be able to exit the carousel of experience, even if it's completely positive all the time: Alone the idea to be *imprisoned* in existence sounds hellish.

It seems so weird to me that people who believe in eternal existence, no matter if you die or what you do, create kids like it's nothing. How can you cast someone into an eternity of experience just like that? No one should have that power, definitely no human. 




 Bible-thumpers would say that it's exactly the other way round.

You're a clown wearing a pinstripe suit underneath your clown-suit while acting as if it were the other way round, probably not even realizing the reality you're dealing with. Everything upside down, inside out. Everybody is insane instead of you. 




 Do you believe that I am God, the creator of the universe? 




 You are acting out the specific fantasy I had of the events that shall not come to play. You are hence a living nightmare. How would I wake up if not by you stopping to exist?

 Etc.

A never ending nightmare. The only way for me to wake up is for most of the people on Earth to die. Hence that is my wish.

My rule of thumb is that 1.5 billion shall *not* die, so that all infrastructure / economy keeps working. Often I wish, though, that the number could be even lower.

(In case it isn't clear: I wish you were among the dead. But that is not the core message of this comment.)

I will now turn off replies, since you are effectively just trolling, though I have no doubt that you are actually convinced that you are right. In truth, however, you are mentally damaged. 




 Dude. You ARE confusing me with someone else. Between me and you is a barrier of fantasy that *you* erected.

And since your accusations are based on unfounded assumptions of yours, *your attack is unreasonable*. And it reveals your character, because you just mother fucking WANT it to be true! You WANT to be aggressive and found a victim to hurt.

I will not forget this, and I will remind you in time that I did not forget this. This is a threat.

 Why is this almost daily and super primitive question approved so often? Every sighted person can do the experiment in an instant. 




  Which is a limitation on his knowledge, and therefore not omniscience.

I will not reply any further, because you seem to have your fingers in the ears. Omniscience is whatever the faithtards will define it to be, just like omnipotence. I didn't make those shit words, I am just discussing them. You are objecting to the knowledge that I have gathered instead of looking around yourself whether what I say is true or not. I am done here.

 It could be the same thing as it never having existed and therefore god not wanting it to not exist.

Maybe so, but this is then the law of identity again, outstretched to logic. Whether or not that is valid can be argued. But just think about this: All the things we deem "logical" could be just that: The fact of existence itself or of its current "shape", outstretched to logic conclusions. This doesn't mean that it IS not logical, it would just mean that logic is a way to describe that which is.

We have certainly reached the point where you keep making claims about me that are not true, and since I, God, fucking hate that, this discussion is over. You will learn in the next weeks of your wrongdoings in this discussion, and you will appreciate it, for it will return you to truth. Or, if you insist until the very end to not learn the facts, you will become undone. This is the apocalypse, and I am the one who decides who lives and who dies. My mind rules all. You will obey, or you will die. 




 Yes, but it's clear enough that it can't become what OP feared it might possibly become. 




 GOD FUCKING DAMNED, now I typed all this shit but can't post it because the link has been removed. So, I'll just put it here. I am fucking ANGRY now. Someone has to suffer for this.

----

The world will *certainly* be a much better place without religion, because religion does the opposite of what science does, in two ways:

1) Instead of using the method of doubt to find greater levels of certainty, it uses the method of faith to assign levels of certainty to claims that don't deserve it.

2) Instead of bringing the truth about the people's environment to them and thus increasing survivability and quality of life, they give fantasies the same value as actual facts and, well, basically allow people to live a life in a fantasy world: Many people sharing the same fantasy and claiming that it is actually true "makes it real" via the omnipresent people who believe *that* it is real. The brain who decided to unreasonably believe, no matter what, can conveniently confuse this quasi-manifestation of its truth-value with *actual* manifestation. "Might makes right." and "Might makes reality." to some degree.

If religion would go away, the most potent agent for helping people to confuse reality and fantasy  and the most potent promoter of unreason would go away. It would finally be *possible* - because the *opposition of BILLIONS* would be absent - to establish a kingdom of truth. Where presenting fiction as facts (aka LYING) would be much more stigmatized as it is today. Today, if you really look at it, people distort the truth 100 times a day.

When was the last time you realized that all stores that show you prices like 3.99 instead of 4 are *lying* to you for the purpose of making more money?

Intentionally distorting the truth is lying. Intentional informational deception is lying. In a world with a much higher overall truth-level, the presence of a lie would be much more resented than it is in this fantasy-infested cesspool that I did not choose to have to dwell in. It's an emergence / threshold thing. With a higher truth level, introducing lies would be rejected a lot more.

But why truth at all? Well, do you want to touch the hot plate? No. That's a very coarse example for why you'd prefer to know the truth, but if I'd have to list all smaller examples, I'd have to type for centuries, so you have to extrapolate. The more fine-grained the presence of truth about the world is in our minds, the better our lives and coexistence will be. 




   Not if will is free.
 
 If god can't know the future, then his power is limited.

Yep. That's my stance, anyway. But the point was that "omniscience" doesn't have to mean "I know all the future!", it could mean "I know all about the present and can extrapolate the future quite precisely."

 By stating that "he would have to unmake them", you are assuming that logic applies and then concluding that logic applies. 

That isn't yet even logic. We're still talking about most fundamental actions. To do something implies that something happens. Also, the purpose of doing something would be to achieve an outcome or to experience the process of doing something. In both cases, an effect takes place. If the effect is undesired, then God is forced to not do it, otherwise he has to live with the effects.

All this is just the law of identity, basically, outstretched to sound like logic. Or is it logic?

But let's look at this differently: The universe exists. If God would want it not to exist, he would have to unmake it. There's no way for you to disagree with this. Hence your objection has been disproved.

 We all make intuitive assumptions, and many have intuitions so strong that they will refuse to relinquish them (as you do in this case).

I am not doing that, as I just demonstrated. In case you keep insisting, let me tell you this:

I am God. I know myself. And I certainly know logic. 




 Well, the Higgs boson was only hypothesized until it was found (has been confirmed by now, right? I'm not completely sure.) - its properties had been described, because the standard model required this particle to exist, so the properties were hence quite clear.

Made-up? Nope. But I think that by your logic, you could argue that it was made-up (until it was actually found). Now, scientific hypotheses are of course falsifiable, a different beast from "I thought something up maybe its true!!1", but I wonder what *your* reason would be to say that the above is not a counter-example.

By the way: I recently realized that some God-claims are quite falsifiable. The experiment is either to die and then to see, or to wait for the apocalypse. Stuff like that. I mean, if we say "No, that's too long.", then how is a hypothesis that first requires the creation of a particle accelerator for a decade falsifiable? It's just a very long-ass experiment :) 




 Found in the frog-dictionary under "envy". 




 :P "sixty-second'th service submarine"

Now I want to found a biker club called "Health Angels". 




 Could someone stabilize this, please? It's really more shaky than acceptable. 




 Well, that reminds me of when I used an LCD projector to watch movies and play games: 2.5 meters diagonal, and I was only a little more than 2 meters away.

Playing Far Cry 1 like this did give me an emotional experience of a vacation, I kept telling myself how great it is to be in the jungle, at the beaches, and most importantly to swim and dive in the water. This was an activity that did not play a role in the story or gameplay itself, it was just there - and it was visually quite convincing, at least enough to convey the feeling. I could freely choose to do that at (almost) any time during the game, and with 2.5 meters diagonal that did have a much different impact than just seeing it on a screen, even if you get very close to the screen (increasing the apparent size). 




 But what if a god exists? If someone gives a definition of this existing god, they are not creating it. Of course, if someone *makes up* a god-definition, they are making up the god. I feel like we're discussion whether the color white is the color white. 




  This is the same thing as knowing the future.

Not if will is free.

 but this tells us nothing about the rules that God must act under once we assume that he does exist.

That is true, and that's something I wish other people would understand, too: They can't just make claims about God like they do, because they'd have to know his situation. If they accept that omnipotence is restricted by logic. The others can make up shit all day long, being practically omnipotent because of their fantasy, and that's why we have to keep those people at bay instead of allowing them to have any leverage.

Ok, so let's say God exists. Now he can do stuff that is illogical, right? Nope. Whatever he causes will be effected, so God will have to live with the consequence. Of course, God could wipe these things off his blackboard, then they would be gone, and he wouldn't have to live with the consequence any longer. For that, however, he would have to unmake them. This is a necessity that he has to *obey*. Logic.

We can't go further than that, because that would require us to know his actual situation. But until now, we can see: All logical. And now, where our knowledge ends, logic ends, too? No. That is an unfounded claim that is contrary to the evidence.

Btw., do you know about the problem of evil? It paints a grim image of God. The only way to get out of that is to assume that God is restricted by logic. Most theists here do agree that he is, e.g. they would say "Humans have free will, so if they choose evil, there will be evil." Again, logic.

It's idiotic to assume that in all those corners where we just don't have data, God magics around in violation of logic. It's a convenient unfounded claim that I reject unconditionally.

 




 Think about it in terms of energy. Let's say you put amount X of energy in accelerating object A so that it reaches 0.5x the speed of light relative to B, then you accelerate object B in the opposite direction with the same amount of energy. The relative velocity of the two is *exactly* the same as if you had put the amount of 2 times X into the acceleration of object A without accelerating object B at all.

Will object A move as fast or faster than light relative to B? Nope. Same applies to your question.

So, what if we use 9999999999999999 times X for accelerating A (and B not at all)? Will A move that many times as fast as it would have moved with 1 times X? Yes, from its own perspective it will, at least in terms of arriving at the target point in space faster from its own perspective, a point that was defined before starting the acceleration. The way this is implemented / kept compatible by the universe is: Time dilation and length contraction. 




 So, you don't care about old or new definitions of god(s) because without sufficient evidence, why should you. Am I oversimplifying this, or is that really basically all you're saying? 




 Yes, that is so, but reducing the problem "universe" to "quantum vacuum" does not change the discussion we're having. I really don't see the relevance.

And about the good reasons regarding his honesty: I already explained those in that very comment. He knows full well that the thing he's talking about does not really deserve the term X, yet he calls it X to make heads turn. That is a fucking lie if I ever saw one. 




 I don't know anything about that, but I made a small game in Java 8 that uses sounds and music which is all completely realtime-synthesized. From what you wrote, it sounds as if you could be interested in the source, so here it is:

  This is a very contentious point, because it would mean that all miracles are untrue. 

Umm... no, it doesn't. I mean, I personally believe that they didn't happen, but as I said:

  As long as we don't know the full rule set, we can't exclude that e.g. a temporary suspension of nature's usual workings is a logically coherent thing.

So, it might be logically coherent for God to manifest things out of nowhere, even if this might seem to violate what we know of how nature works. Technology magic indistinguishable.

 Also, the only way out of the omni-contradiction (omniscience negates omnipotence) is to say that logic does not necessarily apply.

Another way out would be a different interpretation of omniscience, too. E.g. what if God knows everything about *now* and can hence make wonderfully precise extrapolations that can even say things about society 1000 years later?

But ultimately, all of that is irrelevant: God has to obey logic. But since you apparently don't accept this, could explain to me what hole you see in what I already said:

  "I, God, exist. Therefore, I am able to do stuff. If I would not exist, I would not be able to do stuff. Hm. Fuck me, my omnipotence is limited by logic! That won't impress the kids at all. (Better make the universe infinite instead of just a few thousand light years in diameter. Oh, wait. Can't decide that at all because of logical constraints.)"

  - Logic absolutely applies to God, too. Or do you think God would be able to do things if he wouldn't exist? No, right? Therefore, you accept that logic applies to God, too. Doesn't get any more simple or obvious than that.

Because unless you clarify what your stance on this is, the discussion is over for me, because I feel like I'm being preached to.

 Or more generally: People do stuff, and as long as this doesn't cause harm: Let them. Because preventing them from doing so certainly causes them the harm of non-freedom. 




 Is it? How do you define hate here? Is an animal that acts aggressively because of an intruder in their territory acting in a hateful way?

I guess that the hate you're referring to requires an intellectual process and/or communication. It could be argued then that hatred is man-made. 




 Also: Why would it matter whether homosexuality is a choice or not?

If it wasn't genetic, would that make it immoral? It would just a choice like any other, and as long as all the people actually involved *truly* consent (instead of just appearing so or having been "brainwashed" or something), who the fuck is anyone else to object? 




  But logic may simply be a man made process, or perhaps a function of the universe, but that doesn't mean it applies to god. 

"I, God, exist. Therefore, I am able to do stuff. If I would not exist, I would not be able to do stuff. Hm. Fuck me, my omnipotence is limited by logic! That won't impress the kids at all. (Better make the universe infinite instead of just a few thousand light years in diameter. Oh, wait. Can't decide that at all because of *logical constraints*.)"

- Logic *absolutely* applies to God, too. Or do you think God would be able to do things if he wouldn't exist? No, right? Therefore, you accept that logic applies to God, too. Doesn't get any more simple or obvious than that.

 Indeed, they *must* deny it, because otherwise their reasoning does not work.

Theists have accepted that omnipotence refers to "anything that is *logically possible*" for centuries. I really need to dig up a source for this, because it keeps coming up, but I am sure of this. It's not like industrialized people invented logic and hence found the problems with omnipotence. After all, there were great logicians well before the supposed birth of Jesus, known til this day.

 According to theists, logically impossible things happen,

According to some people, logically impossible things happen. The claims of others, however, are deemed *by them* to be compatible with a scientific universe. As long as we don't know the full rule set, we can't exclude that e.g. a temporary suspension of nature's usual workings is a logically coherent thing.

 To put it another way: because their world-view requires a break down in logic and you insist on applying logic to it, you conclude that they are wrong.

I'm not sure what you're referring to. So far in this discussion, what you say imho doesn't apply to me, but I could be mistaken. I think you're effectively talking more generally here, not exactly to/about me. I just object to "God is outside logic" and stuff like that, not necessarily to other God-claims.

 Your intuition that logic must apply is stronger than your feelings about whether there is a god or not. 

I am actually a theist :) (But a fervent religion-hater.) 




 Yes. That is like sick people spreading their disease. They need to be *quarantined*. 




 Waaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit a moment. I was with you until "(which you can't)". But the door swings both ways: Logic can't be proven via logic, *nor can it be disproven via logic*. So, you can't use these statements to logically conclude ... Because that doesn't fly. It's a paradox. In the immediate vicinity of a paradox, you can make things up (incl. their opposite).

I think you could say that "the theist can ~~reasonably~~ claim that [logic] may not be universal.", but you can't use the previous statements to give it any kind of logical fundament.

And actually, here's simple proof that the theist can claim this - but would be wrong:

"God needed to create logic for it to work." -- This can't be true, because "If he hadn't done that, logic would not work." - so it was a *logical necessity* for him to create logic. Meaning that it wasn't, because logic existed/worked in the first place. I claim that God absolutely has to obey logic like anything else. 




 Then the point of everything is to find out that there is none. Meaning that the process is required for the individual. 




  Massive Historical evidences of witnessed Miracles, visions, fulfilled prophecies,.

 Christs resurrection witnessed by hundreds.

Apart from the "never defeated arguments"-thing, you had a really good comment going. Up to this point, at least.

These especially *are* defeated, and if you actually believe that they are not, then no discussion on the issue can be had with you, because you're either dense or unwilling to accept, no matter the evidence presented. 




 I get where you're coming from, but I don't get how you believe this to be a proper discussion.

Let's say God exists. Besides the universe, he has also made two angels, for personal company. Now there's a book that claims that he did not make those angels. This book is not describing the same being.

I think you are saying that "This book is describing this being, but it is describing this being wrong." But /u/Capercaillie said that "the God of the Bible doesn't exist", and with "the God of the Bible", they obviously mean "God as described in the Bible".

Did you really not get this?

But *in case you DID get this:* What do you intend to achieve with this confusing annoying discussion style?
