 Wow. Nice. Thanks for uploading. I've not seen such an effective one before. Having them all aligned so one could scroll through without refocusing was a novel experience for me. I really loved the puddle in no. 17.

 Well I once saw a policeman drink from a can of beer that he'd taken off someone. That leads me to think that certain cops might see some extra-curricular perks in busting people for drugs. 




 I think constitutionally they *were* making sense. 



















 And it seems murky whether there's legal accountability for them actually fulfilling their promises even if they reach their total, as [this sorry episode](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/176413565/why-honey-is-not-vegan/comments) indicates.

 Why don't you try these people (https://twitter.com/bjfrith; https://twitter.com/JEMilne; https://twitter.com/SargNiall)? 














 The problem being that those things are not *a priori* mutually exclusive. 




 One could argue that they are representative of someone who's voting according to the parties' policies and nothing else. As is the nature of this survey in particular.

 And the good thing about being Labour or Tory is that you needn't be creative in your policy making because you can rely upon votes coming from tradition and habit.  




 I wasn't.

 Really? How much does your pee cost? 




 You can buy toothpastes that claim to whiten teeth. There are also things one can buy at a medium sized pharmacy. I can't personally vouch for them however.

Remember too that the idea of pearly white teeth is an offshoot of the age of advertising. Healthy teeth are naturally off-white.

 Thank you for that. And thank you for providing those hyperlinks. Just what I was looking for. :) 




 No. I'm referring to the monastic codes of conduct:

The Suttavibhanga contains the basic training rules for bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, along with the "origin story" for each one. These rules are summarized in the Patimokkha - http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/sv/

The pratimoksha, which has been translated into English, lists the rules but doesn't contain the stories as to how they supposedly came about.

For example, there is a rule about not starting a fire and I'm curious as to what occasioned it.

 1.1 Religion or belief is defined as:

 any religious belief, provided the religion has a clear structure or belief
system. Denominations or sects within a religion can be considered a
protected religion or religious belief. Appendix 2 provides a list of
commonly practised religions in Britain.

 a philosophical belief (see below).

A 2009 Employment Appeal Tribunal decision defined the criteria for
determining what a philosophical belief is. A philosophical belief must:

 **be genuinely held**

 be a belief and not an opinion or viewpoint, based on the present
state of information available

 be a belief as to a weighty and substantial aspect of human life
and behaviour

 **attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and
importance**

 be worthy of respect in a democratic society, compatible with
human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of
others.

Humanism, pacifism and atheism could be examples of philosophical
beliefs.

 There is more on the Human Rights Act [here](http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/your-rights/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act) if you are interested. 









 This paragraph was elided for reasons of brevity and relevance:

The guidance applies not only to Christians, Jews and Muslims but also druids, pagans, Zoroastrians and even atheists. Such employees can ask to be excused any duties they find at odds with their beliefs and also request time off to attend religious festivals or pilgrimages. 




 Any boss with a vegan employee who has strong religious views and profound ecological opinions should brace themselves.

New [published 7 April 2013] guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will allow that worker to request not to have to fly to meetings, not to sit on a leather chair and not to have to work on important days in their religions calendar.

The document details additional protection to those with profound personal beliefs. It states that employees may assert the right to discuss their personal beliefs in the workplace and employers should not prevent such conversations....

The EHRC guidance, *Religion or Belief in the Workplace: a guide for employers*, has been produced after a series of rulings by the court. These include the landmark ruling giving employees the right to wear a cross or other religious symbols even if it breaches company dress codes.

Vegans could legitimately request having their role altered to ensure they do not have to handle milk, cheese, meat or eggs or even have to sit on chairs made of leather.

Vegetarians could ask to be exempt from duties that contravene their views, such as cleaning out an office fridge that had meat in it.

The Vegetarian Society said the guidance gave official recognition that vegetarianism can be and indeed often is a deeply held belief.

Alex Douglas believes her veganism cost her a job last year and the new guidance might have protected her. The 25-year-old vegan was delighted when she secured a job at a coffee shop in Glasgow and, despite her views, says she willingly handled dairy products.

Three months after joining she was told her passionate views meant she would be better served working in a vegan environment and she was asked to leave. During the working day I would talk about being a vegan. I wouldnt preach at all, she said.

The guidance says ecologists would be permitted to tell colleagues that it is wrong to drive to work because it damages the environment. They could also ask to be excused from duties that increase CO2 emissions, such as flying to business meetings....
Employers would also have to take seriously requests by people to observe religious custom, such as daily prayers for Muslims and the Sabbath for Jews. The guidance says employers should agree unless doing so would cause massive disruption, cost a lot or have an adverse impact on customers.

The guidance asks all employers to review work-place policies and practices to ensure that they do not unjustifiably discriminate against an employee who requests a change due to a particular belief....

It says religious people may also seek to promote their beliefs so long as this is not intimidating, hostile or offensive to others, and leaflets can be distributed.

Mark Hammond, chief executive of the EHRC, said: The right of people to express their religious belief is a vital freedom guaranteed by the European convention on human rights.

 'Chien', no doubt.

our names for livestock generally have Anglo-Saxon origins (e.g. sheep, pig, cow) which are exchanged for Anglo-French terms once they are prepared for the table (e.g. mutton, pork, beef).  




 I'd just like to say that I partially regret including the Spectator quote. I don't agree with it. It does help to desimplify the topic of the reception of the documentary but does so at the risk of simplifiying the documentary and the documentary's topic however. 




 The competing critiques come from [Jonathon Sturgeon, Russia Today](http://flavorwire.com/503003/too-dangerous-for-television-adam-curtis-afghanistan-documentary-bitter-lake), and [The Spectator](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/culturehousedaily/2015/01/adam-curtiss-bitter-lake-the-tv-equivalent-of-staging-hamlet-without-the-prince/) respectively.

 Is a worthless whore still a whore? 




 What does your heart most long for? 




 OK. What you meant is, Jew-hate is nothing other than Jew-hate.

The hatred of a white supremacist towards Jews in general might have a large amount to do with their Semitism, qua coming from the Middle East i.e. being brown/associated with 'brownness', in addition to their subscribing to the Jewish faith. It's multi-faceted. 




 The only semitic people in Europe were Jews, and therefore it only applied to jewish people

Ah, I see. That makes sense. Thank you.

that still doesn't make antisemitism anything other than jew-hate.

Can you elaborate? 




 And would it not be correct to refer to Islam as a Semitic religion? 




 Nice. 









 "Monks, it is just as if a donkey were following right after a herd of cattle, saying, "I too am a cow! I too am a cow!" Its color is not that of a cow, its voice is not that of a cow, its hoof is not that of a cow, and yet it still keeps following right after the herd of cattle, saying, "I too am a cow! I too am a cow!" In the same way, there is the case where a certain monk follows right after the community of monks, saying, "I too am a monk! I too am a monk!" He doesn't have the other monks' desire for undertaking the training in heightened virtue, doesn't have their desire for undertaking the training in heightened mind (concentration), doesn't have their desire for undertaking the training in heightened discernment, and yet he still keeps following right after the community of monks, saying, "I too am a monk! I too am a monk!"



"So you should train yourselves: 'Strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened virtue; strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened mind (concentration); strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened discernment.' That is how you should train yourselves."

 OK. So if the turnout is the same as last time the candidate of the average constituency would require **2219** votes to get their deposit back. 




 How many votes does a Green party candidate need to get their deposit back? 




 The oppressors like the oppressed fearful. 

**EDIT:** Oppressors like the oppressed oppressed. 




 Eloquence from Angus MacNeil:

I listened intently to the speech by Dame Joan Ruddock. She mentioned the 1980sa time I clearly remember as a teenager, when nuclear annihilation was seriously talked about and people did seem to comprehend the awful, frightening and terrifying possibility of the use of nuclear weapons. Over time, people have perhaps become more blas and this has crept into our discourse, so there is not as much understanding of the insanity of nuclear weapons as there used to be. That may be to protect our own sanity personally from day to day, because if we were to comprehend it, it would blight our lives. We have a feeling of powerlessness about it, so why worry about it day to dayif it is going to happen, it is going to happen. I say as a crofter from the highlands, however, that this is akin to the happy lambs who play in a meadow unaware of the autumn slaughterthe mass slaughterto come.

The right hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford reminded us of the wisdom and courage of Colonel Petrov, who had the data and information available to his senses from the best technology available at that timethat the west had fired five nuclear weapons at the USSR. What would have happened if he had acted in the way he was meant to act or in the way we were told he would act, or if he had acted logically on the basis of MADmutually assured destruction? If my memory serves me correctly, this comes from the theories of John Nash, the Nobel prize winner in economics. If Colonel Petrov had responded in that way, I would not have seen my 16th birthday. I have thus had 28 bonus years as a result.

If Colonel Petrov is still alive, I say that if ever there were a man deserving of the Nobel peace prize, it is certainly he. We were saved by our alleged enemiesperhaps by their humanity. We were saved again by a Soviet submarine commander during the Bay of Pigs incidents in Cuba in the early 1960s. The actions of those two men disproved the MAD theories, which were the foundation of the nuclear club to which the UK had itself belonging. They behaved in a way that was outside MAD. They did not do mutually assured destruction, although they thought they would be destroyed themselves.

As the right hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford said, our luck will eventually run out. Nuclear weapons have been in the hands of human beings for only 70 years. Given the two near misses that I have citedand there have been moreI invite Members to engage in a thought experiment. Had nuclear weapons existed since Roman times, how much would history have progressed before nuclear annihilation? If we extend our 70 years to 140, or 210, or 300, how long will it be before it all goes wrong and our luck runs out? If our luck does run out, it will run out big style. I have to say, with respect to my friends in the Green party, that it is not gradual global warming that should be worrying us, but immediate global frying and the destruction of all creationa sin like no other, which may result from omission or commission.

 They dominate British politics.

You may be wondering how many Old Etonians there are in government jobs in 2011. The answer (drumroll) is 12! (Andrew Neil in his programme quite rightly says 8 Old Etonian MPs are in the Government but Ive thrown in Peers who hold jobs in government too  thats how, a bit later on in the programme, he gets to the percentage figure of 10 per cent of Ministers being OEs).

Heres the list:

David Cameron

Lord Howell (Foreign Office minister)

Henry Bellingham (Foreign Office minister)

Lord Astor of Hever (Defence minister)

Hugo Swire (Northern Ireland minister)

Sir George Young (Leader of the Commons)

Oliver Letwin (Cabinet Office minister)

Nick Hurd (Cabinet Office minister)

Philip Dunne (whip)

Bill Wiggin (whip)

Lord DeMauley (whip)

Lord Sassoon (Treasury minister)
