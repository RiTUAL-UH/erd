 Autodesk provides their CFD program at no cost under their educational license. They also seem to have informative training materials. This may be of some help if you need a program to use at no cost.

/u/whynotamp, is Anderson's CFD something I could pick up during my undergraduate studies? If so, what concepts should I have familiarity with, or classes should I have already taken, before beginning such a book? 




 Thank you to all who provided some recommendations. I'll look over these and pick one to proceed with!
