 a normal Bulgarian super brute

You mean like his character was when he started?  He was never a full pro-Russian character.  That was a subtle character change. 




 [You think you know my grin?](https://whatistheexcel.com/wooobooru/_images/19f7e9d31a5562a6d4940bb5c1673c9f/4857%20-%20edge%20grin%20wwf.png) 




 Not just the stories, but his actual matches too.  Same formula.  Show up, gyrate and slick hair back, point to self getting in ring, slight offense, get ass kicked, oversell, comeback (clotheslines, corner splash, neckbreaker, yeahhhhh!) more ass kicking, occasional Zig Zag outta nowhere, get hit with finisher and oversell).  I'm not saying he is horrible, just boring and predictable (same could be said about others, i.e. Orton, Sheamus, etc).  HE could be used better somewhere else like GFW or ROH or NJPW, although he would make far less. 




 Every single person that has had a longer than 5 min match with him in which they kicked out of the AA. 




 Owens has the mic work to help carry the feud, whereas Neville doesn't.  Plus Owens can also work and sell and be a legit badass 




 You must have a lot left in the tank 




 No problem... best of luck with getting the promotion all set up. 




 Wow...racist much? 




 I don't hate him.  I am just bored with him because everything he does is the same thing over and over.  And it's not just on him; he does what he is told to. 




 Personally I am a fan of technical and lucha.  That being said, the lucha guys/gals should not only have other same styled opponents, but they should have bigger guys to work with too (not all the time) 




 Quality announcers that will call the moves

Good mix of wrestling styles

 




 The best part is the ref's reactions 




 Because the KO punch is easier to hit on opponents of all shapes and sizes where the Chokeslam is not 




 I mean I was talking overall... not just this storyline.  But yeah this one is pretty bad 




 It's Tuesday which means I will be watching [Chopped](http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/chopped.html) 




 I hope so... he has become so boring and disinterested.   




 So has Sting....

See I can do it too! 




 God dammit Dirty Mike... you and the boys just get outta here 




 3 weeks later and guess who is still here lol 




 ~~complying~~ complaining 




 Orton... sadly there is nothing he does anymore that makes me excited to watch him 




 Anything orton does 




 Michael Cole 




 The Dennis Miller pop 




 I'd say all forms of crossbody go here... and 100% agreed on his running one. 




 Crossbody 




 Sharpshooter 




 Dropkick 




 Clothesline 




 How many blondes does it take to screw in a light bulb?

5... 1 to hold the bulb and 4 to spin the chair 




 I honestly didn't mean for it to be really negative.  More just frustrating because I want to pick one but the other is the overall better option lol 




 I can imagine... tough thing with brackets 




 Some of those matchups were stupid... Stone Cold or Christian?  Christian was awesome but you can't compete against Stone Cold.  Lesnar vs Mickie James?  Wow I wonder who wins that one lol. 




 Taker is petrified of cucumbers 




 I came to cheer, not to whine

 To poach the wrestlers and put TNA out of business. 




 I'm from Southern NH and I would have to go with [Freakin Flax](http://www.wawwrestling.com/freakinflax.html) from WAW wrestling 




 I don't doubt it at all 




 Damn... Jeremy Wyatt must be amazing if you had to list him twice 




 How hard is it to watch actual television?

 Is that the Gooch? !? 




 Seriously I'm so sick of seeing this post at least once a day.    




 Anyone would be better with James Mitchell as their manager.  He is just awesome. 




 this makes no sense 




 The Ascension... less goofy LOD and more Gothic styled bad ass asskickers 




 So did Bush... *BOOM* 




 God damnit I care!  Wrestler cosmetic surgeries are my bread and butter.

 Sheamus... everyone here seems to hate him so the hate could rub off on me 




 Did somebody call his mama?

 And if you happen to not agree with what was just said... I have a couple of words for you.... perform fellatio on it!

 There is a big difference between speaking in a taped and edited backstage segment and speaking live in front of a crowd.  He needs to work on his live promo stuff, just because he really hasn't had much in the way of that. 




 frig off Mr Lahey 




 Can't be done... Kane run-ins are great 




 1.  Crappy WWE logic

2.  This question gets answered every single week.  He is under the ring.  When they play video packages and the arena is dark, ring crews come down to work on things and Bray dresses like one and then slips under the ring.  Lights go out...come back on...and there he is 




 So you conveniently ignored the highlights of his time after and focused solely on the bad parts just to further your argument.  That is fucked. 




 Dislike because he was one of the worst/most boring characters/personalities ever in the company.  Great wrestler though. 




 It was Seth Rollins overcompensating to make sure J J and Kane are on his side.  Chickenshit heel tactic to suck up to the people that "protect' him. 




 So we're ignoring his tag title run with Kidd?  So yeah you are ignoring things to shit on it.  And the plans have changed with Cesaro because he was doing tag stuff.  Now Kidd is out and he is doing single stuff.  So your logic is fucked. 




 You're just looking for reasons to shit on this 




 How is he ruining them?  By using them?  Sounds like the stereotypical "me no likey Cena" person to me 




 If the rumors about him leaving are true than this is WWE's way of making him look horrible on his way out. 




 Peanut butter and jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaammm!!!!
