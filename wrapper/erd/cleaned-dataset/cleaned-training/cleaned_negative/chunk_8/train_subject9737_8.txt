 Marriage to a Westerner? There may be non-profit organizations that may be able to smuggle you out.  




 I graduated college when you did and I understand this struggle.I think it comes with any transition phase where we are faced with questions like what now, how can I move on, and what will happen? I have small goals (at least one job application a day, even using mouthwash) and larger, season-based goals like finding a new job or getting an internship. Dividing a transition phase from where you are to where you want to be into tinier pieces may make this easier on you. I think you should take some time for yourself too. Good luck :-) 




 My dad has a cough drop every night at the same time in the same place. Has to be THAT brand and THAT flavor because otherwise, it isn't enjoyable. Maybe this is out of habit, or maybe cough drops have an ingredient in it that soothes the mind. It could also be the association with cough drops and being sick.. Perhaps OP and people like my dad are soothed by cough drops because they assist in the healing process when someone is sick.  




 Perfection.  




 Besides awesomely hilarious mustaches, what else do you think contributed to it? 




 Lost my keys once and found them in my underwear drawer. Also have a bad habit  of switching up the milk   sugar.. Sugar in the fridge, and milk on top of the stove.

 Seriously. I'm surprised it hasn't happened again with all the high-tech play toys we have today. 




  Do you think these people of power (Hitler, Stalin) running WWII had similar characteristics?
