 Do not listen to the third one. I do not want people to think this is what Germany is listening to.  




 An internet recorded whilst holding the camera steady. non I can die happy. 




 Thank you. 

I do not like the /r/nofap thing though.  




 Coo. Thank you.  




 Well, let's say it's difficult. I really like it you know. 




 I am just wondering if anybody else feels weak after masturbating . Even like an hour later I still don't feel at full strength.  




 Most boring city in Europe. Such a disappointment  









 And Saturday night?  




 I like it but I feel you should crop off the top. If you don't, part of the roof has to be in focus as well.  




 So, can I post a video of me cutting some bread? I'm not saying people will enjoy it, but I can, right?  




 Not a chemical reaction at all. 

Not

 thank you very much 




 Even if my example is bad, the point remains. I am sorry if I gave a bad example. It does not change that when supply increases, price goes down.  




 UK alternatives?  




 I don't understand. What made them decide to go to the gym now that did not apply when they were 40 kg lighter? Why wait so long to do something about your weight? 




 Maybe, but I hate my wake up melody at the moment and it really annoys me.  




 This is so perfect! 




 I appreciated your pretentious shit a lot. I'll see if Miles and /r/jazz will do any good for me. Thank you!  




 I know TT exists for Android, but its unplayable on my z3compact. 




 I am considering to buy (in Germany) and talked to my friend to get some advice. He told me that I should consider two points when deciding to get a mortgage:

**1. Rising Interest Rates**

This is obvious for everybody and all you guys probably know this. When you take out a mortgage you not only have to calculate if you are able to shoulder the monthly payments now, but you also have to calculate if you will be able to if interest rates rise to a certain level as soon as your interest rate changes. In Germany interest rates are normally fixed for 10 years. After that the interest rate WILL change according to the level they are at then. So you will have to try and anticipate a worst case scenario and find out if you can still pay your mortgage. Again, this is basic stuff and if you do not take this into consideration yet, you really should.

**2. If house prices drop**

Even though people on this sub might be mindful about point 1, a lot of people in the real world are not. They are (and have been) taking out mortgages for the past years because interest rates are so low. And that is fair enough. However as soon as interest rates will go up (and they will at some point) many of those people might not be able to afford their mortgage anymore and will be forced to sell. Personally I think that many people take out mortgages that are on the limit of what they can afford (because they want the nicest house they can get). As a consequence many people will be forced to sell when interest rates go up. This might lead to a decrease in real estate values because the market will be flooded with property. See Detroit. This will then mean that your security with the bank (your house) loses value and the bank will increase the mortgage repayments because of the increased risk. This might then lead to further house sales and boom! Bubble!

**My message is:** When you take out a mortgage, take the above two points into consideration and make sure that if either happens you will still be able to pay the bank otherwise you will lose your home. I am not saying don't take out a mortgage. Just make sure you consider possible future scenarios. 




 Can you recommend some? I don't know anything about Jazz.  




 Cello Suite no 1 is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks  




 Saved because it's great music, but not what I would like to wake up to. Thanks for the music though  




 To wake me up, not to prepare me for battle. Great theme though  




 Awesome song. Saved it to my playlist. But not uplifting enough to wake me up.  









 This is not a photo of a real person. 

This is a CGI, right? 




 Sorry, I chose the wrong word. What I meant was:

We accept that they are a different kind of people. We love them, celebrate them, follow them, want to be like them. They give us something so I believe that is the reason we accept that they are so rich.  









 Exactly he even experiences changes in the environment. When the ground changes as his house is destroyed the time machine is bouncing like a low-rider. So he must actually be present at every single point in time along his journey.  




 As the machine is travelling to the future, it is still always in the same place. Therefore whoever is standing next to it should be able to see it because it is not instantly going to the new time, but just moving through time faster. The passenger should only appear to be moving slower depending on the speed the time machine is travelling at.

I posted this before in /r/movies 









 Not trying to say other answers are wrong but I believe part of the answer is:

For drunken sex the person who is not intoxicated is being held responsible to protect the intoxicated person (because they cannot defend themselves)

For drunk driving the person who is intoxicated is being held responsible to protect the people on the streets, who do not have a way of defending themselves against a car with a drunk person driving.

When the goal is the well being of the people this makes sense from my point of view. The situations are not comparable because there is alcohol involved, but because the well being of people is at stake and the rules have been made based on that.

I hope I got my point across.  




 My understanding is that if two identical clocks would have been created very soon after the big bang in places that have experienced different gravity until today both clocks would show a different age for the universe.  




 I know. And it's funny as well.  




 Sounds like a good business model to me.  




 I was expecting lots of people to like this, but I found that most of you don't really feel like it should be killed. 

You guys go! Killing animals should NOT be entertainment for us.  




 The water interferes with the touch screen though. It's slightly annoying.

 Can I just say that supercritical is an awesome word.  




 I think it's because celebrities are untouchable. They have a magical skill that we accept as being special. 

The CEO of a company on the other hand is just some guy. He has to work like everybody else. He sits in a chair in front of a computer like everybody else, but he gets paid 10000 times what we get. That is the reason if you ask me. It's because their job is too close to what we do for a living but his salary is way higher than ours  




 The white motherfucker who...  




 I've got the same problem actually. And I have no solution for you.  




 Maybe you're trying too hard to use difficult words?  




 I just won't let other people have their way even if it has no impact on my life. I just HAVE to comment. 

I hate myself every single time.  




 Try saying bacon is not god food.  




 Me included: people feel too free to make arrogant statements that they would never make in real life because it's unacceptable behaviour. And often it's wrong as well.  




 You need to use the elevator to escape but only half the group fits.  




 I quite like that one actually. 




 She cold 




 Was that her team-mate or the host?  




 Well I live in London and hate shopping here. Everywhere is the same (reiss, massimo dutti, topshop, zara, etc.) or its way to alternative. I would like to find somewhere that sells shirts, jeans, t-shirts and jumpers that are not branded but decent (not necessarily great) quality. I don't want to be spending 90 per shirt though. 

I might be asking for something that does not exists but I am personally very disappointed with the selection in London if you are not willing to spend crazy money 




 Would you mind recommending other places in London where I can find some cool clothes?  




 Did he do anything? Or why is he being arrested?  




 Light up there is just very good. I think that makes a very big difference.  




 ... 50% of the times.  




 I'm on mobile. Look up a video of the konmari method. She's a Japanese lady who developed a system to deal utter your life. I think her books are very successful. 

Edit: there http://tidyingup.com/

I haven't tried it myself but sounds like it makes sense.  




 How many calories is that?  




 I made a similar experience. 

the only thing I want to add is: 

Because this sub is relatively small your post won't just disappear when downvoted. The result is that even though your post has zero upvotes it will still be visible for people who actually want to help. 

What I am trying to say is: If you post something you'll get two types of replies: The ones you mention but also helpful advice. 

Just ignore the ones you don't like and reply to the good ones.  




 I recommend you try for a while and see if you make satisfactory progress. 

If you don't then it doesn't work. Trial and error is the only thing you can do if there are restrictions in your life.  




 Or, OP should just do what is possible for him and see if it works for him. 

It doesn't make sense for him to think about it. He should try and see if the result are satisfactory. If not, then obviously it's no good. 




 Thanks guys. I've ordered the peanut butter . 

Thanks for telling me I'm a pussy. I think I needed that. 




 Thank you. Just ordered it.  




 Cool. Ordered 1kg Peanut Butter. Thanks.  




 I have a slight problem and just wanted to know if you guys went through the same.

I was on 1600-1800 kcal a day for a long time and got used to it. Now I started bulking and really struggle to eat 2400kcal. 

I guess its easy to get there by just eating McD and shit like that. But eating the same healthy and filling stuff I ate before makes it almost impossible. 

What do you guys think? How are you doing it?  




 Too big for me. I've got tiny hands.  




 If I see a guy in the gym with terrible form, do I tell them? I do not look like I know what I am talking about.  




 If my TDEE for maintenance is 2100 kcal per day (desk job and no sport considered) how much do I need to eat to bulk? 

I understand that the answer should be 2600kcal. But if I go to the gym 3 times a week, the TDEE calculator tells that I need 2400kcal for maintenance (desk job and working out 3 times a week). Do I need to eat 2900kcal?

This always confuses me and is never made clear anywhere. I do leangains and I need +20% maintenance on workout days and -20% on rest days, but I never know what I am calculating from.  




 You better think again. It clearly is. Let me know when you figured it out.  




 You have been places. Your pictures are amazing.  




 You can't just make me feel this way and then just drop me. Why would you do that? Yes it is complicated now but you have a responsibility now.  




 I don't understand. I am over 30 




 This is gold. I love you.  




 Sorry, actually you are right about that. That is no comparison. Did not mean to waste your time.  




 You did not answer the question. 

There is no evidence any/all of them are actually predators. If you are being accused of something, its all the same if you are innocent.  




 Got any more like this? 




 I understand what you say and I 100% agree with the fact that none of these rules are "god given" or simply right. Exactly my viewpoint. Fairness is also a human construct and we should not think that this is a universal rule for the whole universe. 

However I believe that if you are part of a society you should accept the rules and norms of that society. If you do not, then you should also not claim for you the benefits that the society has to offer. Your call. If you claim the benefits and don't follow the rules, I don't like what you are doing and I will express that. Again, such a person should not be forced to do any of what I believe to be correct behavior, but if they don't then I will (and so does /u/pancakessyrup ) comment on that. Personally I think his argument is spot on and flawless. But I accept that it's all a matter of opinion. 

I just want to point out one thing:

I am sure all these people who now say that /u/pancakessyrup is a dick will suddenly agree with him when they have their lives destroyed by a stupid TV show (no matter if guilty or not). Peoples believes go straight out the window when their own ass is on the line. So I can only respect /u/pancakessyrup for being aware of that . 




 God, I really wonder if you can manage to go home and have a nice cold beer and just relax after all this. It would infuriate me.  




 I think what you should consider is this: 

Hansen has the right to do so, but not the obligation. He could choose to let the legal system work and not make the TV show. Nobody is taking that right away from him. It is a matter of opinion. 

However the people he accuses have their right for fair trial taken away by Hansen. 

Do you know what I mean? 




 What are those holes? I am eager to learn.  




 Sorry to get involved in your thing here. I am not judging and don't care about you. I am just curious:

How would you feel, if a girl lured you into her room and had sex with you when it turns out afterwards it was for a TV show and she was actually only 16 and you are being accused of being a predator on TV. The thing is, maybe you are, maybe you are not. But in case you are not, how would you feel about it?

Edit: The reason why I am asking is: I am sure some of them are predators, and some of them are not. Is it ok to sacrifice the ones who are not, just so you can destroy the ones who are? 




 Not jokes
...

...

NOT! 




 At first I got really annoyed by people writing that a certain question is getting old. After a while it really got on my nerves as well. 

True story.  




 I am a buyer for auxiliary equipment.

I want to either be a carpenter and refurbish furniture or have my own pub (which would show football on Saturdays)

Edit: God, I am happy I was able to answer. I though I didn't know what I want, but it seems I do. Just need to figure something out that's more realistic (at least in the short run) 




 Final line is amazing. 




 I personally think this is the best I have seen. Not because it look sooooooooooooooooo spectacular but because of how well it's done. You must have put so much work into this. 

I love it. And also the fact that you are not trying to sell it by showing skin. You look awesome 




 Seriously, thank you very much. There is a sky scraper close to work. I'll try to take it slow and work my way to the top. 

I think this is really good advice. Thank you.  




 Thank you. 

I should have kept reading the comments. Sorry to waste your time. 




 Everybody who tells me to avoid them:

Thank you for participating, but 1 thing I am sure of is: Going out of your way to avoid feeling the fear is the worst you can do.  




 What am I looking at? 




 Looks good to me though. What exactly happened? 




 What I don't understand is how do they just slide smoothly in place. I feel like there should always be a short CRACK, when they connect. 




 Please do so. 




 I think it's nice if people want to start getting into a form of art. If this is your first attempt and you're trying to get better at it, then I hope you will do well. 

At the same time I am guessing you will want constructive criticism. There is one major problem with using an app (or not putting in the necessary effort)

On the left side the tree and the plant should either be completely in focus or completely out of focus. If they are not it ruins the picture. In this particular picture the plant should be completely out of focus and the tree should be in focus judging by how you chose the area that is in focus. If the app is any good, then you should be able to draw on areas that should be in/out of focus. I would love to see how the picture turns out if you change those two points. 

No offense. Seriously.  




 I think he says "I don't wanna bang this chick"  




 When I look at female hard bodies (not the body builder type, just fit with muscles) I always think that I would be more than happy with their physique. (I am male)

Can I understand they also had to bulk at some point?

I am currently on a cut and don't really want to bulk because I used to be fat and am scared to just get fat again but I def need some more muscles.  




 In a good way, right?
 




 I love the stuff and it fits my macros. However I cannot help but wonder if I should be eating less. I eat about 250g per day (sometimes 500g) 




 Not very pareto...

Edit: Thinking about it, I don't have enough information to make that statement. 




 I like this explanation. 

However as far as I remember, he doesn't. As soon as she gets the watch his time in the tesseract is over and he ends up years later in space. Is that incorrect? 




 I don't understand why it is ticking anyway. My friend says its due to the manipulated gravity in the room. If that is correct, then it should stop ticking as soon as she leaves the room. 




 Might be totally wrong because I don't really understand the fucking movie but here goes:

Her dad is trying to give her that equation right? He seems to believe the best way is to communicate it via morse code. I don't like the idea, but that's fine. 

I found it weird that he is able to manipulate the watch to do this. After all he has been granted access to an extra dimension and not given unlimited super powers. My friend thinks that he manipulates the watch through gravitation the same way he did when he communicated the first message (sand on the ground). Again, I don't like that idea but that is not my point. 

She looks at the watch, recognizes its morse code and has to leave because her brother is coming back. 

Did she immediately understand and memorize the whole thing?
As far as I understand dad was only able to manipulate gravity in that room. I believe the watch should have been useless once she left the room.  




 I read this book:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nothing-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions/dp/0199225869

The universe (the vacuum) is not empty at all. Very interesting read. I do not know however if an atom is actually empty. 
 




 God, I miss uni. If I told my boss that he would fucking fire me 









 I'm from Germany and I still expected this to have happened in Florida  




 Not that I contribute anything to that knowledge, but I would find my existance even more pointless if I knew that if anything would happen to us/earth that our entire achievements would just be gone.  




 Just because all of it already exists does not mean its good or userfriendly. Doing existing things better is also innovation. 

So if you are right that it will never happen, then you have a point. However saying this is boring because all of it already exists, meh, I think you don't have a point there.  




 I feel for you. I'm thinking to just quit and work somewhere for minimum wage for a while and see if I "find" myself.  




 This is the major problem. When you look for a new job you are only allowed to stay within your field. I want to change my career. So let me ask: what are you looking for ;)  




 Studied business administration and international management. Now work in a major heavy industries company in procurement.  




 Nope. Procurement for major heavy industries company. I guess consulting would be more pressure still 




 I am honestly thinking to try and become a teacher  




 If we do half half I'm in.  :) 

What job are you looking for. Maybe my company is hiring.
