 This is pure speculation on your part and appears to have no basis in reality.

It is not known how or why this avian influenza strain is spreading so rapidly:

"As a third U.S. state declared a state of emergency, scientists are scrambling to understand the H5N2 avian influenza virus that is ravaging poultry farms across the Midwest. At least 30 million birds in 12 states have been affected so far, either infected directly or scheduled to be culled, in the largest outbreak of a high-pathogenicity avian flu virus in the United States in decades. The new strain, which emerged in wild birds along the Pacific flyway several months ago, has not yet infected any humans, but researchers are puzzled by its path of transmission and other characteristics. An ambitious case-control study about to be launched by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the University of Minnesota, and the turkey industry may help answer these questions."

 Nigeria has no refineries, and has not paid its bills to the refiners-so the refiners quit supplying.

"The crisis began when oil suppliers, hit by tightened credit lines and unpaid interest, said the government owes them as much as $1 billion for fuel and subsidies going back to October 2014. They said they could no longer afford to supply fuel."

 I am a hospital physician and deal with death every day at work. I like to talk with cognitively intact 90 year olds 'cause they're time machines-a view to an era people born today  would find alien.

Sometimes I'll tell such a 90-plus year-old about [Jeanne Calment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment). If you ask some who's 92 if they'd like to live another 30 years they *invariably* say no.

I am an amateur geologist and astronomer, so my view of time is tempered by that, also. In geologic terms the entire duration of humanity's existence is but a hiccough in the big scheme. An if you reflect on the scale of the universe it's hard to make a big deal about your own life.

 When I was a kid (early '70s) most of the bikers I knew were-not very nice. The feelings of brotherhood so often espoused here were not so common then. Dentists definitely did not ride Harleys then.
