 "You are depressed?! Good!"

 It always makes me think what those people think it is about the age of consent that somehow magically makes fucking someone who was 15 the day before when it was "wrong by most people's moral code" absolutely OK the next day? (age of consent is 16 in many countries, mind you) Fucking a 9 year old (let alone a toddler) would, I think, be "wrong by most people's moral code", but the claim that with 15 year olds it's the same is just silly. 




 Of course it's not real.  




 It's amazing how Reddit always hops on subculture hate trains. I am not a furry, but I don't see anything wrong with furries. 




 I'd imagine that some cities weren't affected at all (except by nuclear winter). There would be some mutants, but nothing worse than before. 




 I don't know if interesting, but quite embarrassing - when I was in primary school, one winter day I and my classmate were going to wait for the public transport and we somehow thought it would be fun to throw chunks of frozen snow in front of passing cars. We kept doing it for a few minutes and then a policeman came from the nearby police station (it was in fact next to a police station) and warned us not to do that

It was incredibly stupid.

 Fuck, I can understand attraction to 15yos, but with small babies it is just sick shit. 




 /thinking how assasination could go further/ 




 The cheaper and safer is just to hire some random Slav off the street. 




 You can find people fucking animals (and vice versa) here on Reddit. Just saying. 




 Is your last name Butt? Like in Dick Butt? 




 This is the nicest deep web story ever. 




 Lol, that is one of the few reasons I fire up Steam and play KSP through it. I want to brag about how many hours I've wasted sitting in fron of my computer. Welp, now I am sad. 




 You are the hero the meth grandma needs, but not the one she deserves.

 I have an unsatiable craving to make secret pony threads right now. 




 Share and enjoy! 




 I noticed that when I started watching the show. Nice touch :) 




 Hah, spiders can't write English! 




 I was playing on a crappy PCs until a year or so ago when I built my own powerful PC. As always, at first sight 60fps is butter smooth and you get used to it, so it doesn't even seem so after while. But then you get a game where fps was locked at 30fps and it takes a while to get used to it and it looks quite jittery at first or even after during quick camera movements.

Look here, you will see the difference

I'd say it is definitely worth it. 




 actually, i am one time zone from London, GMT +1

 [](/butwhy) I think there may be a conspiracy going on between manufacturers of toilets and manufacturers of toilet paper. Since the jet-prone bowls are the standard, it benefits the toilet paper manufacurers, since they sell more of it.

 









 Is there a screenshot? 




 I have never read manga, but NHK deals with such an interesting theme (I am fascinated by phenomena like hikkikomori; besides, I hope I do not become one myself - though I do not know if a westerner can become a real one, as the societal conditions are different from Japan -, as I do not go out often and most of my free time spend on PC) and the anime had some really good messages that I should consider reading the manga just for the sake of filling in all that was ommited.  









 thank 




 I am not that fat yet. 




 Not *too* young, tho. 









 Ayy, Vietnam flashbacks! 




 The thing is that the religion virus preys on naturally selected human characteristics like pareidolia, superstition, pattern-recognition abilities (these three got a lot in common), the drive to protect offsprings, the self-preservation instinct, and other things.

You gotta train and educate people in critical thinking and skepticism to recognize inborn human fallabilities, whereas faith and religion thrive on the lack of these things.

It's a hard fight, and it may be that some form of religion always arises and it is thus virtually unweedable, but it is worth trying to get people to be more reasonable, because it brings progress. 









 Who the fuck beats birds? 




 Yeah, that was priceless. 




 Even better, try to open a text editor and write 10 dots, copy them and paste them 10 times, then copy and paste that and so on, after a while your computer will have problems with that. It's telling how big those numbers are when a modern computer can't handle them well. 




 Et tu, Jesus? 




 This Ain't Fallout XXX 




 What I mean is that besides the stock fan coming with the CPU I got an aftermarket one gratis with with all the parts I ordered.  




 I got a free fan with my parts, but I don't use it (because I have not overclocked) :P 




 True, some of us are even homeless, like this one guy with a notebook at Starbucks (or wherever). 




 This is a very cool shitty robot :D 




 But Tunnel Snakes still rule, right? 




 Evian? Isn't that that overpriced water? 




 Okay, then 




 I hear dubbing is usually inferior to the original. The subs to WtNHK are very well done imo. 




 like a caveman 




 You should at least learn to read cursive. 




 I consider cursive to be superior to print because reasons. (my handwriting is pretty bad both in cursive and print, though) 




 I am feeling old.

BTW I have you tagged as Space Unidan. 




 Come to the dark matter side, we have... uh, we actually don't know what we have. 




 BBW 




 If only internet speeds increased proportionally to games size. 




 Little Big Planet 









 (   ) 




 Smooth. 




 I am happy that peasants will get to play this game, but I cannot fathom it not being inferior experience - KSP controls are extraordinarily complex with its many poorly documented combinations, modding  will be either nonexistant or very restricted etc. 









 Can confirm, been to London once with acute bronchitis, the winter cold and drizzle didn't help much.  




 I finished the anime just now, and I liked it very much. 









 And what about mods? Consoles and mods don't go along very well.  




 I see no point in that since the Sun probably doesn't care, but I can see it is a nice gesture. If only more of us would revere nature more.

 Idk, I don't think I would want water squirted on my anus every time I poop. 




 With your trusty club. 




  Looking at a sexy women is not going to help my FPS. 

If that acronym stood for Faps Per Second, I think it actually might help.  




 What were the specs of that beast on the right?

BTW I get that sex sells, but it is a cheap marketing tactic. It's kind of offending when a company thinks their customers are primitives who can be lured with dem bewbz. Dem bewbz be nice, sure, but still.
 




 Preferably, try not to get any loan ever if you don't really have to. 




 So roving will finally not be a pain in the rocket exhaust? Awesome. 




 hahah, it's like a hamster peeking out of its nest 




  It's entirely possible that that's makeup

 I've got low self-esteem, but my face on Tinder is unedited. What about that?

 I would like to be a fertilizer. 




 Not only it exists, but I seem to be already subscribed. I don't remember doing that. O_O 




 Already beyond half the anime episodes. And I don't watch anime often :) 




 Why that got such applause? Shit's wrong. It shouldn't even have to be mentioned, it should be considered granted. 




 Or not, there was this one TIFU about a guy telling reddit jokes irl :)

Either you already are, or you'll become after FO4 is released. 




 I hope there will be a dynamic gore system. 




 I don't. ;)

 I still haven't finished Blackadder :/ 




 Dully noted. Thanks. 




 It is a famine wearing a cape. 




 I would love if more companies did this more often. For example, if HL3 was released tomorrow.

 Well, I don't use Linux - or, rather, I had Linux (ubuntu) installed, but when I installed W8.1, I couldn't (or was too lazy to) figure out how to set up dual boot. So I do technically have a Linux partition, I just haven't got there in a long time... 




 With this huge a community, it's not possible to please everyone, given that each person likes something different.

 Downthemall looks nice, but not really what I need, or at least I haven't noticed that particular functionality. I specifically need it to be able to follow a link from that page and then follow the link to the image itself. 




 Why, yes, it is. :)

One of the things I hope I live to witness to, though, is humans landing on Mars. There is at least a possibility that in some martian rocks there are fossilized microorganisms. 




 I am under the impression that they actually [confirmed](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/18/philae-lander-comet-surface-detects-organic-molecules) presence of organics. It is not that of a big deal, since we know simple organic molecules are pretty common. 




 Hi, I am mainly a hoarder of pictures (26k so far, all handpicked) and I was wondering if there is a simple utility to download them for me.

This one site regularly links to pictures (mainly on deviantart), and it would be good if the utility could be set to identify the posts with linked pictures, get their links and download them in full resolution? 




 thank mr. skeltal

now we need pitchforks 




 Oh bot, you so silly. 




 Seriously? 




 If you were motionless, then you wouldn't fly off. However, make a step and you are up to a long arc which will land you on the other side.

 (Un)surprisingly, yes!

 Why would you expect a random comet to have a signs of alien life? 




 the title is a tl;dr 




 I think they already have. 




 It feels like 3 months ago... I stayed at home and watched it all day. 




 YUROP **is** relevance. 




 /r/FunnyandSad  




 I was thinking about Philae today, glad to hear it is back. 




 I got a 2 GB and several hundred MB ones, but I have since disassembled them (fuckers are extremely tough to crack) and use the magnets as key holders. 




 No, people keep asking, though, so here's a copypasta of the explanation:

It has to do with panting. "Funt" means to pant in Czech and when I was little and used to go to school with my sister I would pant because she was bigger and older than me and I had problems to catch up with her. Idk exactly when it happened, but she called me "funk" a couple of times, I think, and I made a nickname out of it later. It is not easily translatable, but I think "the little one who pants" could be fitting. 




 Thanks for reality check. 




 That hard Aryan stare - dayum... 




 What d you mean, exactly? Gummy being the Sovereign? That would've been awesome. 




 I think that changeling may have been a Chrysalis' agent sent there to steal love.

 That is a weird way of spelling Gummy.

 This episode... this... episode... WHAT

That was something, and I mean real something.

I can't. 




 I guess. 




 It's a blast, but what's up with people liking Nazi+dinosaur mashup? 




 This is actually mean, I like it. 









 But that 99% chance of hitting head...

 Why did you censor the butt? :-$

 Yes, it does.

 This is amazing. 




 I wonder if that could hurt a person.

 Mesmerizing as fuck. 




 Yay for banning fatpeoplehate. Now you just ban other idiot subs. 




 Nice selfie, OP. 




 Contact lenses. 




 The depth is fixed, but you can put the drills lower on the rocket so that they don't go so deep. 




 It's not cheating, but it helps greatly to have it. Without it you have to overengineer a lot because you don't precisely know dV and TWR data.

It's better for you if you learn to eyeball it first imo, though, 




 I just fly before the port with RCS, roughly align myself (viewing both vessels and their relative position from different angles), and then slowly flying towards it and aligning it better. I use no mods.

The attractive properties of KSP ports also help, because even if you align the rockets imperfectly it will latch. 




 Try to fly it to another spot on the asteroid, and/or deeper/shallower drilling (or reinstall KSP/verify cache). 




 Cat's got the magicks.

 Actually, I don't think it would happen that much - Africa is really big, so it would just be an isolated civilization.  




 And then conduct medical experiments on them to see how human immunity has evolved since then. 




 Thank you. 









 Or fabulous, it's just a matter of perspective. : 




 Cool info, thanks. Btw I remember Geralt slicing people's armpits. 




 Man, this is better than /r/trippinthroughtime 




 So done. 




 Lol, using "natural" selection to get rid of the weak and then hire the winners :D

Also, I would like to be able to just go on random murder spree.
