 I don't see any discussions regarding matches? NAR vs Complexity for example 









 TI4 HYPE 




 how did you find this? Is it only Sven or what?

edit: why is AM showing up 2 times?? 




 so they are coming out tomorrow, ^^right?

right?


RIGHT!?!?! 




  nless you mean the forums, but honestly prediction forums are always full of no

prediction forums? 

can you link me please? I meant dota2lounge subreddit tho, there's a forum??? 




 before update? What update? 




 nice rant, I'm a fan 




 who won first game? Wings or EP? 




 Yes, you are the only one, courier's been out for 3 days since we had hit that stretch goal 




 Title.

dotabetting is dead, dota2betting is private, dota2lounge is dead, anything else? 

Any other sites where people post their insight and such? 




 yea, right... 




 where? 




 where is CDEC an underdog? definitely not on dota2lounge 




 then it's bettor, not better 




 BETTER QUESTION IS: WHEN??? 




 THIS HAS TO BE ANSWERED PLSSSS 




 YOU SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH 




 so soon??? 

IN VALVE TIME OR BLIZZARD TIME OR WHAT MAN???

WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS??? 




 you can change it still even tho it says it's 'locked' 




 c/p

Basically, I have to rely on mouz and ehome getting 1st place, rest I pretty much fucked up.
Wings got through instead of HyperGloryTeam, and NA is just a big fuck up overall anyway.
I doubt they'll implement anything like you suggested. (I'd be more than happy if they do) 




 DON'T CALL ME ANXIOUS, I'M NOT ANXIOUS I'M JUST A BIT STRESSED OUT OK????? 




  the end of waiting is near!

LIAR 




 no way man, SHUT UP, SHUT THE FUCK UP DON'T DO THIS TO ME 




 why? it won't happen :) 




 Nope, I bet they'll publish immortals after the qualifiers end. 

If they get out a patch tomorrow with immortals and courrier, I'll gift 1 compendium to a random person here.

 :D 




 Immortals are done, polishing is not but smoke and mirrors, they are just waiting for hype to go up or something, whatever, volvo is weird 




 Each time you copy and paste this, someone dies, stop fucking doing this. 




 I hope that was sarcasm. Otherwise, you are pretty fucking dumb yo 




 because volvo is fucking with us

^^^kappa 




 how come 0%? not even 1%? 




 + courrier

Dark Reef escape for Slark or Offers, d2 keys ... 

I usually play Phantom Lancer, Bristleback, Bloodseeker but feel free to offer sets/items



 




 What kind of fucking post is this? Game 1 isn't even over, dafuq? 

'Team Wings are doing it!' 

What the actual fuck dude? 




 nothing I think, unless you correctly predict which team will be 1st, that's 50 points. 




 Yes, but that reverse fucked me up, and now I have VoidBoys, NAR and NOTTODAY advancing and being in top4 which is impossible :( 




 I just need HyperGloryTeam to win vs Wings, and CDEC to win/draw vs Wings and I'll correctly predict top 4. 

Odds of that happening? 

Ugh... 




 While we are at it, did anyone pick Root gaming but the game ended up switching to Void Boys because of the bug and vice versa?  




 Better question is: Why do we have to wait THIS LONG to get cosmetic items? 




 Ehome won 2-0 over EP, which automatically puts them on first place. EHOME can either lose/win/draw their last game, the outcome won't matter. They are first. 




 Prepare your cats! 




 wasn't the game almost closing out? why did they ask so late on it? 




 Why did they want to remake the game? 




 Why did they want to remake the game? 




 why? 




 nop 




 65 levels? how come?

So basically, it's the same thing as buying straight up levels?  




 Since I already have lvl 90 compendium, will purchasing lvl 50 one give me 50 more levels + all default rewards that you get for buying compendium? 

Or will I get only +50 levels and rewards for reaching level 100-105 etc.

 http://pokit.org/get/img/e7614d1d896c02f7f374a3794455f444.jpg

Is this the one? Worth around 15 on market?  




 exactly. I don't wanna hope. It won't happen. Gaben will disappoint me
 




 I don't wanna hope. It won't happen. Gaben will disappoint me 




 You don't understand, I won't fault you for that, but please educate yourself in business 101. 

Making a chest, or anything for that matter, will get INTO THE GAME EVENTUALLY, how come you don't fucking understand that? 

You think that if they make something, and they don't hit that goal, they'll just throw that shit away? Are you fucking mental? IT'LL GET INTO THE GAME EVENTUALLY. 

Do you not understand basic logic? 




  to unlock them then their work would've been for nothing 

**nothing**? 

alright, I'm done, peace 




 how about you stop being fucking fanboy and realise that a company such as valve should have had this item prepared long time ago. How about you also use your fucking brain and understand that creating game content of great quality doesn't take 10 months to create? Huh? How about you fucking do that? 
 




 there shouldn't be any 'polish' bullshit, we reached our goal, how about they fullfil their 'promise'? 




 how to get the flame/red one?  




 Anyone picked Void Boys instead of Root gaming by mistake in predictions? 

Valve picks were bugged, so instead of picking Void boys, the picture would show Root gaming and vice versa?  




 did you get 30 points like a drop that occurs occasionally after the game or ? 




 you got 30 compendium points by watching on twitch or ingame? did it drop after the game or midway?

 that bait 




  #stillgreen 




 I feel like adding orange and pink would be a great idea.  




 I wouldn't know, I'm waiting for a whole pack to go on sale
 




 only first episode :/ 




 http://steamcommunity.com/id/train_subject9972/inventory/#753_1

Something from my inventory? 




 will think about it and let you know 




 what 




 Cheapest price please, offer below. 




 No problem, I hope you'll enjoy it! 




 My review of the game: 

This game is what Murdered: Soul Suspect could've been and even more if it had focused on improving its mechanism and graphics. 

As a person who expected a lot from Murdered being the fan of the genre itself, I really thought there's nothing else these type of games can improve on. And I'm delighted and happy to say that this game proved me wrong. Not only does this game is stunningly gorgeous in any possible way, it also has that creepy atmosphere that makes you really think about every process you make and things you do in the game. 

"This game doesn't hold your hand" - is damn right, and I love how it isn't completely linear. You can explore and find cases however you like, there's no really a perfect order or the right order for that matter. You will end up doing the same thing in the end, and the fact that it's kinda "open world" with few limitations here and there is one of the pros of this game. 

For this price range, I'm not sure if a game that's around 4-5+ hours long could satisfy everyones needs, unless you are a fan of detective   mystery games such as myself, but I would definitely consider picking this up as soon as it hits your optimal price range. 

Score: 7/10 




 That's nice. 10x tf2 keys at current price is 19.40. 

Killing Floor 2 is 19.99, which is the cheapest amount if you compare it to other ROW regions. 

9x chroma 2 keys at current bring it to about 19.08. 

Good luck finding it for 10x TF2 keys / 9x CSGO keys, I'm sure there are plenty of people around selling for that price and willing to lose some money. :D

 




 Killing Floor 2 - 10 CSGO chroma 2 keys 




 oh, alright, thanks for the answer 




 who's the other GK? 




 unforgettable?

 I drink a lot of energy drinks but I'm not that fat. Are they really THAT bad for your health? 




 lol? 




 I have Athlon X4 640 3.0 and 7850 1GB with 8 gigs of RAM. I'm eager to upgrade, and it'll have to be really soon. 




 Same here, I was thinking about buying that same combo with maybe r9 290x instead of GTX970, but I'm curious if I should actually wait or what?  




 So basically, I need help with my build. I was thinking of upgrading my PC from Athlon II X4 640 3.0 and 7850 1GB to something more beastly, capable of running nowdays games on high/ultra settings. 

My first questions: 

**Should I wait for next generation of CPUs by AMD or even INTEL later in the year?** 

If I wait, I'll have to endure till the end of the year with this PC that barely runs most of the games nowdays. If I buy a PC however, **will it be somewhat timeproof?**. 

Lastly, what would be my optimal pick for PC build? Considering I'm about to buy parts from my country, and it's mad expensive, I have around 1000 to spend. 

Given that here, GTX 970 and i5 4690k are 650, what would be the best bang for my buck? 

Maybe R9 290 Tripple X or something? 

What would you guys recommend overall? I plan on having this computer for at least 3-4 years, will that be possible with this amount of money?

Please help, and sorry for wall of text! 

TL;DR Read everything marked with **black**. 




 Never said I don't like chanting about other team's players. I said I don't like teasing of Stevie G particularly.  




   he has his few uses

^^LOL 




 wait, so to be loyal, I have to really dislike Stevie G.? Are you fucking retarded dude or what? 




 That defending was even worse than when JT scored. 




 You judge me if i'm a real fan based of liking Stevie G. or not? I asked you before, and I'll ask you again, are you retarded? 




 What's funny? 




 I don't like all this teasing of Steven Gerrard. He's a good player, he didn't deserve it. 




 doesn't mean anything? I heard it's pretty important for Liverpool  




 Terry never won a Champions League? 




 Come on HR I believe in you! 




 I'll pass, thanks 




 C. 

Is the outcome different if you pick different options? 




 I've beaten 3 games in the previous week. 

**Ryse Son of Rome** - Great game, a bit repetitive,and a bit too short, but I enjoyed it overall, cool story and a fun experience. 

**GTA V** - Nothing to say about, a little bit disappointed with the end (maybe it was my fault in the end), but the story, voice acting, characters and everything was so detailed, I really got myself into it and I started caring for every single character. Loved it, fantastic example on how triple A should be made.

**Perils of Man** - Short, but interesting adventure game, with interesting thoughtful story. Although a little bit buggy, if you manage to overcome its flaws, you can really enjoy what it has to offer. 

Currently playing: 

**Ori and the Blind Forest** - nothing much to say about this game, best $20 spent in a long long time. Fantastic game, with fantastic gameplay mechanics and graphics that  will leave you completely speechless. Must buy in my opinion!
