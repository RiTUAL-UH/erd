 I don't think AR 670-1 defines the IPFU's unserviceability.

 
DA Pam 710-2-2, Supply Support Activity Supply System: Manual Procedures, 30 Sep 98, Glossary, pp. 268-276 defines unservicability as **More inclusive term than damage or destruction. It indicates, in military usage, that the article to which the term is applied is no longer useful for the intended purpose. Damage or destruction may not be involved. The term also indicates property that has deteriorated through use; however, it may include property no longer usable for its original purpose, despite the reason for its condition.**



Technically your pt's aren't unservicable, since they serve their original purpose but they are unpresentable (presentability can be determined by your CO). Unless your NCO argues that the reflective Army logo was a safety thing, in which case rubbing it off would make the shorts unservicable since they don't perform the original purpose.




Bottom line, your NCO/SNCO is gonna fucking win this war. Buy new PT's. 









 Drunk guy is at a bar pounding drinks and he notices a well dressed young man at the other end of the bar. Every time a female walks by the young man he whispers something in their ear, sometimes they look at him shocked until he says something to soothe them, but the drunk notices that several times the women accompany the young man to a private room in the back of the tavern. The drunk has observed the young man score several times today. Thd drunk thinks to himself, "what line is this man using to get all these girls? It has a pretty high success rate." and stumbles across the room and asks the young man "Shayy, what line are you ushing to get all theshe pretty women". The young man politely explains "whenever a pretty woman walks near me I whisper in her ear, 'Tickle your ass with a feather?' If she agrees, we go to the back and get kinky, on the other hand if she is offended I repeat myself 'typical nasty weather' and she thinks she just misheard me."


The drunk agrees that this is a fine line, and decides to try it before he forgets it. He stumbles out of the bar, summons a cab to drive him home, stumbles into his house where his wife is resting on the couch and propositions her "Shayy honey, can I shtick a feather in your ass?" She looks at him and replies "What did you say you drunk sonofabitch?" To which he replies "Fucking rain".






Not super dirty, but I like it. 




 A comment about how shitty 9gag is. 




 Some shower shoes. Gotta love those feet. 




 People spend a lot of time arguing about just and unjust wars. The way I see it, if you are murdering women, children, and noncombatants or committing war crimes you are fighting an unjust war. 


If you are fighting bad guys (The Taliban, Al-Qaida, ISIS, fill-in-the-blank) it may not always be a *wise* war, but that does not mean there is no justice in it. 



Its up to the politicians to decide whether we go to war, it is up to the soldiers to fight those wars honorably. We voice our opinions about the wisdom of proposed wars through the ballot box as private citizens, we actively influence the way in which our nation wages war by behaving honorably in our AO's whenever we are sent to war.  




 Is service inherently honorable?No. If you do shitty and immoral things while in uniform they are no less shitty and immoral. Can service be honorable? Absolutely. Dedicating yourself to making the world a better place and, most importantly, living for the guy to your left and right are totally honorable in my sight.

 




 "Mentee" is a legit word. Protege is also correct. Both are acceptable.




 




 Oh yes, he was a fine fellow.


I don't think it was his lie at all, if I remember correctly Ben Franklin puffed up Von Stueben's credentials to persuade Washington to hire him. 




 The "Baron" who was not actually a Baron at all, haha!


 









 On fucking point. 




 That's the same thing SGM said when I charged my cell phone on a SIPR computer... What am I missing here? 




 I really hope this is a troll. 









 Nope, the media is gonna elect him "official representative for the Army" and blast his opinions. That is how it usually works. 




 I am an active duty E-5 considering moving to the Alabama National Guard. I have heard a lot of negative things, but I was just curious what y'alls experiences have been? I am trying to score a job with the railroad in B-ham or maybe something in trucking, and stay in the Guard for a while? Has anyone had a similar experience? 




 I would love to remove Govt from the picture. As with anything, involving the government with private matters fucks them all up. 




 I don't waste my time thinking about the sexual preferences of other men. I honestly don't give a shit what any other dude likes in thd bedroom. 




 I always think /u/slothfactsbot is funny 




 We all know there are several floating around, which ones are your favorites to run into? 




 I always think /u/slothfactsbot is funny. 




 Yeah, I hate drum. Been here 3 years. I am stuck here right now trying to come down on orders. 




 Outlaw Country.


Because I am country and identify with the themes of hard work, self sufficiency, traditional southern values, and getting drunk 




 I am at Drum too. Just moved to the CAB from 3rd Brigade. 




 I don't know what you are referring to here. 




 We all know there are several floating around, which ones are your favorites to run into? 




 Another OP who thinks random=original. 


Speaking of random, I summon /u/slothfactsbot to bring us some facts about sloths. 




 Loxley, AL.


I don't have to deal with city people. 




 Yes, I meant no legal penalty. 




 Did your hadji commander tell you to post this here? 




 A lot of what we think is funny hinges on the element surprise. Jokes are all about tricking your brain by ending the story different than you expect (aka delivering the punchline).


What we percieve as cleverness is someone else stimulating our brains by inserting a common reference/relatable shared knowledge in a surprising way (for example when they make a pop culture reference at a time we did not expect a pop culture reference).


It all boils down to brain stimulation through surprise. Of course it is more complex than this,  but that is the eli5 answer. 




 Take ju-jitsu. Fighting is not an overnight skill, it takes practice. 




 Afghanistan. I learned about brotherhood, that life is most memorable when shittiest, that the problema we face over here are petty and not worth crying over, and that I don't need half as much stuff as I think I do. 




 I do support the existence of unions. I said that in my first post. I am all for folks *voluntarily* joining together to bargain for healthcare or anything else. I just do not support using the state to achieve those goals. I also stated I would not join a union because as of yet there are none who want to further my goals.


I oppose abortion because I believe it to be a violation of the nonaggression principle, and therefore the lawful domain of state intervention. I believe the state should punish/prevent acts of aggression, since I believe a fetus to be a human entitled to full human rights, extinguishing their life is an act of aggression. 




 You are right, my bad. Corrected. 




 My goals are

1. Deregulation of the markets. Unions advocate for *more* market regulation. I do not support welfare, federal organizations like OSHA, or any other federal market legislation.

2. Total freedom of association. If a business owner does not want to serve or hire someone based on race, religion, or bias, he has that right. Although it is apalling, I believe each individual owns the products of their labor, and can refuse to give those products to anyone for any reason.

3. Many unions support abortion coverage in an employment contract. I do not believe abortions are moral and therefore oppose this.

4. I oppose the state forcing employers to provide healthcare for their employees. While it is moral, and good business practice, the details of an employment contract are for the employee and employer to decide through bargaining the state has no place in the matter.  




 Unions are fine, but should remain voluntary. Individuals must be free to join and leave a union at will. Forced unionization is an infrigement on the right of voluntary association. There should be no penalty for refusal to join a union. 


I would not join a union because there are none whose goals match my own, but if others want to join one it does not bother me.


One important distinction. Progressives and Liberals (in the modern sense) tendto view the world collectively. We view the world through an individualists perspective. My class, race, and cuture do not represent me and I do not represent them. I am my own person, distinct from my class, race, and cultural heritage.  




 I cannot access the republican sub. 




 We aren't emotionally charged bleeding hearts who spend every spare moment on deployment opening up about our feelings and political persuasions..


-Soldier. 




 He was one of only 19 men to win the MOH twice, one of only 2 to win them in separate conflicts. He was an amateur boxer, Marine, fought in the Boxer Rebellion, Banana Wars, and WW1.
During the Battle of Belleau Wood in WW1, he is purported to have yelled to the men of his company, Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever? in order to motivate them to charge the Germans. He was offered the chance to commission as an officer twice, declining both times because he would rather be an outstanding sergeant than just another officer."
[This is him rocking both of his MOH's](http://i.imgur.com/aQiOytq.jpg) Seems like one salty-ass motherf*cker. 




 Apparantly he was one of only 19 men to receive the MOH twice, one of only 2 to receive them in separate conflicts. He was an amateur boxer, Marine, fought in the Boxer Rebellion, Banana Wars, and WW1.

Edit; changed "win" to "receive" 




 Please add me to the Republicans. 




 Why is ending drug prohibition unrealistic? Drug decriminalization and even legalization has been accomplished in many developed nations. If the US is such a haven for liberty and freedom, why can't we do it too?



My end goal would be total legalization. Your body is your own and you alone get to choose what substances your body uses. Realistically I would like to see significant reduction in drug penalties, lower sentences, turn drug crimes into misdemeanors. I would like to cut all funding to national agencies' operations against drugs, especially the DEA.  




 There is no such thing as stress cards, and never has been. 




 I would not necessarily be repealing all aspects of the ACA, just the mandate. 




 1. MEPs is basically just a very long set of examinations, physical, mental, bloodwork, xrays, etc. Once deemed fit it is also where you sign your contract. Basic is tough but simple. It is stressful, drill sergeants will scream at you and get in your face, but as long as you follow basic i structions you will be fine.

2. The cutoff age is 42 for enlistment.

3. Being in the Reserves or National Guard means you go to drill one weekend a month, and two weeks out of the year. Sometimes they deploy and you get active duty pay. Active duty soldiers are on cal 24/7, usually work Mon thru Fri depending on your job.

4. goarmy.com has a list of all possible jobs. Not all of these will be available though. Depending on your ASVAB score and the dates school seats are open.

5. n/a

6. They don't *have* to move with you. If you want to live away from them. You typically stay at one duty station between 3-5 years at a time. As long as you are in the Army you have to move where they tell you to when they tell you to. They will pay for your family to come along and provide accomodations, but if you choose to leave your family behind it is your choice.

7. Yes. When a leader tells you to respond, you respond. No matter how minute or pointless the thing they tell you to do is, you will do it because they own your ass. If you have a temper and a tendency to snap off/talk back to authorith, the drill sergeants in basic willl resolve that issue quickly.



The Army is not for everyone. If you are just looking for benefits, you will be disappointed. There is piles and piles of BS that falls on you the minute you join. At the same time it is rewardinf, enabling, and something you will never forget. 




 A libertarian supporting government intervention in the markets? Embarrassing.


I am also a Libertarian-Republican. I would offer extreme immigration reform, marriage equality, ending the drug war, stopping NSA spying, and cuts in defense.


In return I would ask for support auditing the Federal Reserve, repealing the Patriot act, a systematic removal of gun control, cutting the IRS drastically, and the repeal of the healthcare mandate.  




 You should try him, he is perspective broadening and important to the genre. You may not like him, but there is value to his work. 




 Faulkner. 


I am a huge Southern Gothic and Southern Lit fan, but I have read nearly everything Faulkner has written and not liked it. 




 There are still deployments, some of them combat, some of them more humanitarian. Most folks end up doing overseas tours of some kind whether it is Africa, Afghanistan, or chilling in Guam. There is no way to predict accurately whether you will see combat. 



If you are not deployed you will be training to deploy. In and out of the field, big field exercises, going to the range to become more accurate on your weapon etc.

 Yeah.... No. 




 Not in the NG from the stories I have heard. 




 Lexington Steele. 


Obvious Reasons. 




 You are just talking about American city folks.



I eat Sheep, Venison, Turkey, Rabbit, Quail, Dove, Pheasent and many others on a very regular basis. 



 




 Just because you can put a bunch of random words together does not mean you are funny. More folks need to figure this out. 




 Adolph.


Something about not preheating his oven properly. 




 "Free" and "taxpayer funded" are two very different things. 




 "That dress *did* make your butt look fat!" 




 They are probably ashamed about it, and probably are using it in an unhealthy way to deal with some other issue or insecurity.  I would try to get them to get help for the core issues/insecurities that cause them to drink. 




 Red-what? 




 A lock box to lock your cell phone in.  




 Obviously the Portal Gun. 




 Adolf Hitler and Adam Sandler. 




 I can't really thing of anything. I have a pretty calloused stomach, worn rough by my experiences.  




 Being politically incorrect. 




 Army;

They are kids. Kids act like kids. Everyone needs to calm the fuck down. Hypernationalism usually comes from folks who don't have a clue what real sacrifice is all about. 



The parent needs to teach their kids about respect, and respecting things other people find valuable. I would say letting your kids run wild on an object others find solemn probably indicates you haven't taught them about respect well enough. 


But no, I am not offended.  




 Freckles.  




 I love steak in the mornings. Steak and Eggs is my birthday breakfast every year.

I will never see a more accurate personification of Satan himself. 









 Came from a trailer park in South Alabama. I have now achieved a comfortable lifestyle through the military, and look forward to a very comfortable life after I retire (in 16 years) 




 I can't remember. It has been too long. 




 Loyalty. Sticking by you when everyone else ditches you. 




 The reasons I become friends with girls has no corollation to the reasons the males mentioned in your OP became friends with you. The only way you are going to find out the answer to this question is to be direct and ask them.


I become friends with females for the same reasons I become friends with males; I share some common interest or perspective with them and benefit from their presence. 


If I want more than friendship with a girl I will be very clear and direct about my desires/intentions. 


My perspective is not indicative of the whole male gender though. The males you mention could share my outlook, or they could think totally different. The only way you will find out is to ask.. 




 Its a laser range finder/long range recon system.


Read about it [here](https://www.strategypage.com/military_photos/long_range.aspx) 




 No, I have not deified anything. The Word is not a divine entity, but is the true Word of the only God. It should be worshipped as the one true revelation of God.



The Holy Spirit has many roles. He reveals the scriptures to those whom he will, he works upon the hearts of men to prepare them to recieve the Word, he impressed the Word upon the hearts/minds of the writers of the Holy Scriptures, etc.


Are you asking if the Holy Spirit can reveal God outside of Scriptures? If so, yes he *can*, it is physically possible, but he does not. God has ordained that his word would be the final and closed revelation of himself. 




 Super right wing evangelical conservative. Runs with the like of Glenn Beck. Not someone I would associate with. 




 The direct Word of God. The complete and closed revelation of Himself. 




 Libertarianism advocates a free and voluntary society wherein each individual has the liberty to behave and act any way they wish as long as they do not aggress against another individual's life, liberty, or property. 




 Murder their family and leave a note written in blood on their wall that says "you're next". 




 A bit. Not every girl can rock every hairstyle. i am not a fan of short hair, and I freakin love neon dyed hair.  




 The same bar of Lava soap I use on my body. Shampoo is overrated. 




 Sure. A lot of folks have done so it the past. As far as I know it is not against sub rules. 




 We had/have no endgame. They just want to drag this war out until it no longer makes politicians money. That is my opinion. Just like Vietnam and Korea. No endgame, no good planning, just something that made the politicians look good at the time.


We should have gone in there with the sole purpose of retaliation for their attacks. Shock and awe, obliterate them and their hold, then leave. 




 Nobody owes you anything.  




 I was at Forward Operating Base Shank in Eastern Afghanistan.


I think originally the war in Afghanistan was justified, but politicians put their stupid heads into it. It does not take 13 years to win a war. We should have been done a long time ago, it is not our job to build a nation. Iraq was never justified. Saddam was a bad guy, but ISIS is a helluva lot worse. I don't trust politicians, and I don't think they have our best interests in mind. They don't give a shit how many young kids die overseas as long as they can make it look like they died for something. Since Korea we have been doing the same shit, and young American kids have been paying for the politicians records.



That being said, i fought and lived for my brothers. We were not fighting good or decent people, they deserved every bit of firepower we used against them. I don't regret it, I would do it again. I just wish people cared still. I wish folks cared about the guys who died. I wish people would learn that war is costly and should always be a last resort. 




 Move home to Alabama, buy a few acres and raise sheep. 




 Because western society is pretty self centered and narcissistic. Folks are taught from a young age that the world revolves around their feelings/emotions, and all that matters is that they are happy all the time. 


 




 Lazy motherfuckers.  




 Whenever it is fitting. I cry when friends die, huge emotional events, etc.



There is nothing wrong with men crying. There is something wrong with anyone crying over petty shit.  




 Must be a Navy thing, I don't know. We have MWR sponsored boating and sailing for enlisted and officers alike 




 If he is trying to "hook up on the meat market" he needs to grow the fuck up and stop looking for one night stands. 




 Haha its a little trailer trash town without a whole lot to see, but I love the place. 




 I am from Loxley, but we had our party in Dothan. 




 There is a weird cultural image that a lot of folks have that says a woman who approaches a man is too forward/brash. 




 They don't add value to my life. I personally feel like they would be a waste of my time. I have hobbies already (gardening, hunting, fishing etc) and I am a voracious reader. There is nothing about video games that appeals to me. 


 




 Soldier. 



The effects of White Phosphorus on a human being. 




 At my bachelor party (in Alabama) we smoked cigars, had whiskey tasting, and had some fine steaks. 



P. S. Stay away from strip clubs. 




 His generals were brutal and heartless bastards, he waged war in a brutal way. He was a politically skillfull person. I don't buy the "honest Abe with a big ole heart" persona. He was an imperialist with little respect for the idea of decentralization. 




 When you fulfill your responsibilities and live for more than self gratification. 




 Nope, I have yet to get into videogames. 




 The first time mortars fell from the sky in Afghanistan.  




 Because they don't just accept the most qualified parents. It is pretty easy to become a foster parent. As with most large programs, it is really easy to cheat the system. 




 Be interesting and well rounded. I am in the military too. 

Take advantage of every opportunity for adventure, read good books, and be kind to everyone. If you have interesting experiences and connect with many folks you would be surprised at how many opportunities for female companionship will present themselves. 




 Any sort of compliment, especially from ladies. Deapite what men say, we love when women compliment us. 




 Thank you for your service sir. I am a veteran of the Afghanistan war myself. I was curious, what advice would you have for young veterans like myself? Is there anything you would like to say to young veterans?



 




 A 12 mile ruck march. 




 It is a good forum to practice social interaction. Sure, some people just come here to be dicks but some of us actually enjoy interacting with folks from different backgrounds and with different perspectives. Reddit can be a good place to learn how to politely disagree with somone. 




 Character I would like to resemble/identify with;  **Atticus Finch**


Character I actually identify with; **Forrest Gump** 




 That I would only make a Reddit account to *lurk every now and then*... 




 Tattoos are a strong part of the military tradition. I agree with that. Most military folks (including myself) have several tattoos. That being said, there have to be standards. The Army has no problem if you have tattoos, they just have to follow certain guidelines. The Army will change as the culture changes though. 



No, our recruit pool will not grow slim. We are kicking good soldiers out as it is to meet force realignment. For every kid who doesn't meet the minimum enlistment requirements, there are a dozen other who do meet the standards. 

 




 You are going to have to face this phobia at some point. Getting your blood drawn isn't an Army thing, it is a life thing. Why not go ahead and face this fear with the resources the Army has to offer? 




 I don't necessarily agree with the tat regulations (especially regarding sleeves) but the military is not the place to accept every individual and make everyone feel good. It is not s problem, it is a lifestyle. It is not about being free to be the individual you are, that is antithetical to the military lifestyle.



We have polypro's. They are not practical for year round wear, too hot many kids would pass the fuck out. Plus, at least in the Army, your arms are already always covered by your blouse. You don't need an extra layer. 




 If you would like a high level of discipline, hard work ethic, the ability to totally broaden your horizons and encounter the world in a first person way; this is the job for you.


I am a soldier. Been all over the world, saw a lot of shit, grew up a lot really quick, I am responsible for millions of dollars and the lives of my friends every day. I can retire at 39 and get a pension and healthcare, with plenty of time (and a phenomenal resume) to embark on another career. Oh, and sometimes I get to blow shit up and drive big trucks. And I can say the work fuck in every sentence without getting in trouble with my boss. I fuckin' love my job.


Advice for folks who wanna come into my career field;

1. Don't smoke weed.

2. Don't get in trouble with the law.

3. Don't be a lazy fuck.

That pretty much covers all the bases. 




 1. What huge problem with tattoos? 


2. We already have something similar. Of course you would never wear it under rolled up sleeves because that would look even more unprofessional than some think tattoos look. 




 Put it in a Roth IRA for retirement. You will be set when you are older.

 Bath and Body Works Sensual Amber. Always has been my favorite.

 Be a mother fucker. 




 Have you never stepped foot in the South? We drink gallons of sweet tea a day. 




 Huge. It is larger than my palm. That green notebook it is sitting on is around the size of a waitress pad. 




 I will likely never stop having income. I come from a breed of folks who always have a job until they die. Also, since I intend to continue my military career for the full 20 years, so I will get a retirement pension from them.

Nonetheless, I will withdraw the money when I officially retire from fulltime work. By the time I officially pull my money out it will likely be in the millions.
