 He knew. He was just letting them hang themselves with their "we make everything on the premises ourselves" lie.

For one, they had no commercial baking equipment in the kitchen.

 God, please save us from those who claim they are on a mission from You. 




 The Gunbertarian Downvote Militia will not be pleased with this story. 




 150 years on, and the rage is still there.

Now imagine it as hundreds of years, as in the struggles between the English and the Irish.

Or imagine it as thousands of years in struggle, as in the Middle East.

An excellent case can be made that the Charleston church slaying victims were modern casualties of the Civil War.

Can we remove this poison from ourselves, or is it simply in our nature to seek conflict?

I still don't know why BushCo isn't rotting in the Hague. 




 The loons the American Right has cultivated for over four decades are now coming home to roost. 




 Donald Trump represents the vulgarity of the the last 45 years of angry Republican populism distilled into one bottle: a foul brew of Nixon, Reagan, the Bushes, Gingrich, the Tea Party, etc.

To wit: pride in greed, narcissism, paranoia, a lust for power, a hunger for prestige, quick to anger, and reactionary military attack based on conspiracy theories and/or flimsy/manufactured evidence.

The GOP and those who fund them have built an America where a candidate such as Trump can even be taken seriously; it's left to all of us to deal with the results. 




 It's the most "Windows-y" of Apple-created apps. 




 This reminds me of a similar case from Southern California in 1970.

 They had to use Kafka-Kuffs. 




 Finally, some courts are starting to deal with the GOP's election fraud.

Is it any surprise, then, that McConnell's Republican-controlled Senate is declining to approve any more judicial nominees for the remaining two years of President Obama's tenure? 




 All your water is belong to us. 




 This is probably the first honest thing she's ever said. 




 How many of them wouldn't even be there if it not for his lies?

 Has Alternet been taken off this sub's "banned" list too?

If so, good news! 




 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is nothing but a lobbying group for pushing far-right wing "trickle down" economics.

Unfortunately, because of the name they chose for themselves, people are inclined to believe any crap they spout. 




 Actually, it's the Confederate apologists that need the history lesson. 




 Why can't they let go? It's been 150 years, and the Confederate flag is in no way a thing to be proud of.

Is it just spite?

 Given the Republican base these days, I'm not so sure. 




 That was not meant to be a factual statement! 




 The 'Forced Birth' crowd will hate this one. 




 There are many who have a special interest in seeing that stories like these aren't widely distributed.

This is why *Salon*, *Talking Points Memo*, and even *Mother Jones* (for a time) were for so long effectively banned under the fallacious and Mod-imposed "Rehosted Content" rule. 

The de facto ban on *Salon* and *Talking Points Memo* was recently lifted, demonstrating that some Mods are receptive to reason. However, *Media Matters* (and others) still suffer under this artificial, Mod-imposed ban.

I believe that Reddit's /r/politics community should reflect *the community*, not the whims of Mods who seek to censor content which they may personally find distasteful. Reddit is meant to be a Free Marketplace of Ideas, based on user-submitted, user-curated content. 

Do others agree? 




 This is gross-out stuff. 




 A once-great American political party reduced to a tree stump upon which only vulgarians, morons, and charlatans perch to preach: this is what the Republican Party has become.

I know there are hundreds of thousands of sane, decent Republicans out there across America whose stomachs are turned by displays such as these.

For the nation's benefit, may these Republicans rededicate themselves to reclaiming their party's voice from the ill-tempered, rage-filled man-children who have come to dominate it. 




 It's surprising that this incident hasn't received more attention. 

Why would Rand Paul, who evidently imagines himself a qualified candidate to lead the Executive Branch, consort with Cliven Bundy, who is proud to announce to everyone he meets that he "doesn't recognize the federal government as even existing"?

Rand Paul is clearly reaching deep into his father Ron Paul's well-worn bag of grifting tricks and "LIBERTY!"^TM dog-whistles. Those gimmicks still seem to work on the crowd of oddballs who have fallen for Ron Paul's innumerable scams and paranoid conspiracy theories for decades. 




 It was a decision made by right-wing Mods to conceal how truly unpopular right-wing ideology is. 




 Sounds like the Kochs' "American Legislative Exchange Council."

 The Kochocracy is supplanting the government of Wisconsin.

They plan on doing to Wisconsin what Koch Industries has already to their home base state, Kansas.

Wisconsinites: please don't let this happen. The nation needs you. 




 Be prepared for *Stormfront* copypasta passed off as "proof." 




 *[crickets]* 




 It's getting harder and harder for "Liberty-Lovers"^TM to hide who they are and what they support. 




 This is what the Republicans have reduced themselves to.

It's not the 1980s anymore, guys. You can't just say shit like this and not be laughed at, let alone expect to get away with such crap unchallenged because you're constantly shouting "FLAG!" and BIBLE!" and "MURICA!" 




 Whatever happened to all the loonies out at Bundy Ranch?

The ones who vowed to shoot their brothers-in-arms "The Oath Keepers" for desertion?

Watch the video of these "Patriots" holding their little rage session here. [Back at the Bundy Ranch, Its Oath Keepers vs. Militiamen as Wild Rumors Fly](http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2014/04/30/back-at-the-bundy-ranch-its-oath-keepers-vs-militiamen-as-wild-rumors-fly/)

They've attempted to repeat their efforts at Reddit with some notable successes, particularly in "news" and "politics." Similar behind-the-scenes  "Digg Patriot" hijinks were revealed among right-wing extremist Mods, and (presumably as a result) the worst of them are no longer Mods there. 

Many of their hand-picked successors remain, however. These Mods remain quite fond of censoring legitimate user submissions under the flimsiest of pretexts if such stories do not align with their dogma, or reveal causes/personalities they support for what they are.
 




  It seems like rightwing policy is based more on what feels correct then what is actually correct.

To me, it seems like rightwing policy is based on what feels spiteful, no matter the damage.
 




 Donald Trump is the 'id' of the Republican Party.

It's not a pretty sight. 




 The Republican Party now pretty much consists of the independently wealthy and the Amway sales reps that worship them. 




 Trump is only acting as he always has. It's American society that has shifted from beneath him.

This isn't the 1980s anymore. Narcissistic, hateful, bigoted, swine don't get free passes these days, no matter how many billions in holdings they've accumulated, or how high they wave the flag. 




 [It's depicted here.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Clippy-letter.PNG) 




 Rich white guys need to find a new role model.

Rich white guys never thought Trump a role model.

Poor white Awway salesmen thought Trump a role model.
 




 According to Trump, you're lucky they didn't rape you. 




 Or maybe the Confederate flag's time has gone, and it's finally time to recognize that it's a vestigial embarrassment of our nation's darkest times. 




 Clarence Thomas was never qualified to be on the Court in the first place.

Bush I nominated him. Bush II also did grave damage to the Court with his picks. If for no other reason, this history alone is enough to vote against the would-be Bush III.

 Why soft-launch so early? 




 Here's my recent take:

It's a play to the the Republican's key demographic: poor, angry, rubes who fantasize daily "if this country wuz only run right, ***I'd*** be a Big Shot."

The worship of and reverence for incalculable personal wealth (to which many on the American Right cling) blinds them to their own low status and decreasing possibilities. (Witness the kind of voters that fall for people like Trump, Perot, the Kochs, etc.)

Almost inevitably, their support boils down to the old "well, he's rich, so he must be doin' sumptin' right" canard. 




 Then why all the deletions? 




 Because every Amway salesman fantasizes about being Trump. 




 I'd love to see a further fissure in which the Gunbertarian/Sovereign Citizen types abandon the Republicans and form their own party.

They largely have (see the Paul Libertarians-Chuck Baldwin Constitution Party, ) but they always come home to vote against the Democrats, because "damn lib'ruls."
 




 "And was the raping *legitimate?* If so, the woman's body has a way of shutting that whole thing down."

 It's a hate fest wrapping itself in a pity party.

That's the 'id' of the GOP ever since Nixon. [Listen to Nixon's 1952 "Checkers" speech here for a prime example of this enduring trend.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqjwBDH-vhY)

 He's the "rich, large, and in-charge" type that every Republican male fantasizes about. 




 Chickens from the 1980s are coming home to roost for the GOP. 









  Honest question though, have any Democratic runners spoke out against Trumps attacks on Latinos?

When an enemy is in the middle of destroying himself, don't interrupt him.

 




 It's starting. 




 To say nothing of the integrity. 




 Donald Trump is the personification of 1980s GOP greed and self-worshipping arrogance.

How fitting that he still finds ways to come ever closer to the pride in unvarnished avarice, malicious ignorance, and unrepentant braggadocio of that bygone era.



 




 He wants to control *all* the bridges. 




 Reagan's image is already featured on the National Debt. 




 Reddit's 'Gunbertarian Downvote Militia' remains very active. 




 They're hoping to land book and tv deals on the Fox/AM radio 'Wingnut Welfare' circuit. 




 I wonder if Rand talked with Cliven Bundy about this at their private meeting? 




 They certainly share a lot of fanboys. 




 Good. We don't need a return engagement from Polio. 




 They'd make a great GOP ticket. 




 Why would I expect him to? He's a useful idiot for the Kochs. 




 He and Cliven Bundy should share a blunt in honor of Aqua Buddha. 




 Scott Walker: another tool of the Kochs as they try to recreate the Deep South in the Midwest. 




 True. How many times did the play the loop of that asshole riding his horse up on a dusty knoll and waving the American flag around?

In Bundy's own words, he "doesn't recognize the Federal Government as even existing." But he was certainly proud to wave the flag of the United States for his cheesy Fox "I'mma PATRIOT!!1!" photo-op. 




 Because it's more barely disguised Neo-Confederate "States' Rights!!!" Libertarian bullshit. And Rand Paul learned from the King of all the "LIBERTY!!1!"^TM  fraudsters, his own father Ron Paul, as seen here:

 The ["Southern Strategy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) Republicans have used since Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign  an exploit designed to win power through divisiveness and embitterment  will soon cost the GOP more votes than it wins them.

The Right (the Evangelical Right in particular) is losing the Culture War it started. Once, they called for bans on certain music because they feared the backwards messages allegedly hidden in popular songs would lead America's children to become Satanists  *and were taken seriously by many.*

How might these Culture Warriors respond to their many and recent setbacks? 




 Ron Paul was and is a right-wing conspiracy theorist and Confederate apologist, among many, *many* other faults. 




 Fine, as long as she doesn't wind up Naderizing the election.

Take a moment to imagine the Supreme Court selections of *any* of the Republicans before lodging the usual protests.  




 Also exorcisms. 




 A 'Strict Constructionist,' he. 




 I'm not comparing them as equivalent. That's your attempt to put words in my mouth.

What I'm saying is that the Wingnuts must feel especially demoralized this month given how much phony "moral concerns/we're superior and God-favored" bullshit they've excreted all over the American body politic for decades.

Got it? 




 It's part of an especially demoralizing week for the Right. They're losing all the fights they've started these past few years. (Marriage rights, health care, Confederates repackaged as "Real Patriots" through 'Tea Party' Astroturf, etc.) 

And their false yet eternal "we've got high morals and them damn lib'ruls don't" delusion is crumbling from beneath them: the Duggars, Hastert, and now "Ms. Abstinence Only" Palin again.

It's hard for the American Right to keep the "we're Righteous Culture Warriors, fightin' the Good Fight of the Lord" play-acting going when the nation is finally realizing it was four l-o-o-o-ong decades worth of bullshit contrived to divide us amongst ourselves all along. 




 It's been a very bad week for Wingnuts overall. 




 On their own altar, every fifty years like clockwork.

And for what? 




 And scandalous acts of Duggary. 




 Source? (if other than Stormfront message boards) 




 I wonder who this Job Creator^TM votes for? 




 Nixon's ["Southern Strategy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy), a gambit which the Republican Party has exploited for nearly fifty years to hold power, is crumbling.

What will the Republicans replace it with? 




  damn good thing we aren't all judged by the actions or our children or other relatives.

Or the Duggars.

 




  That sounds closer to a call to overthrow the government than violating the Constitution.

Right-Wing Nut-Jobs/Militias are making a lot of noise lately. Worse still, they've become VERY agitated at all developments in the news this past week  the shunning of the Confederate flag, the Obamacare ruling, the marriage rights ruling...

When these people get pissed, they go big. Anyone who doubts the rage and insanity that powers this crowd of [*The Turner Diaries*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turner_Diaries) fantasists need only remember that after the Oklahoma City  Timothy McVeigh was apprehended wearing a "Sic Semper Tyrannus!" shirt.

 It should be noted that the ***real*** momentum behind the marriage rights push began when it was shown that the Mormon Church spent heavily to kill a California ballot proposition on the legalization of gay marriage.

Thanks for the assist, Utah! It probably would have taken another generation if not for your efforts. 




 That's *three* social wedge issues the American Right has lost in just a week: the Confederate flag, PPACA, and gay marriage.

It appeared too much like an act of conquest.

 ... an explanation which the user community will never be able to *see*, as it's been removed. I don't get how the tautology isn't obvious here.

Leave the Mod-affixed label on if you must, but don't hide the content from everyone else.

Otherwise, it's just a matter of hiding behind a label with the direct intent of killing content, and further demonstration that some Mods enforce rules (which in some cases *they themselves* created) arbitrarily, with zero input from the user community.

Mods ***MUST*** be willing to defend and justify their decisions, not seek to deliberately hide them from the community's view. So, if you *must* label something, let the story stand so we as users can have a clearer vision of what the rules are and how they are applied.

You'd like us to obey the rules, right? How can we know what they are if you insist upon instantly hiding examples of violations behind a cloak of secrecy, in some cases in less time than it could have possibly taken for a Mod to read the article?

If Mod's decisions are justified, the logic of a rule's application should be self-evident, don't you agree? So why hide the content and the label away from public view?

If a Mod can act as judge, jury and executioner, how can we know that the Mod acted fairly and ethically, especially when the article is suddenly buried from the view of our user community? That makes it *seem* like there's something to hide. Those who cannot (or refuse to) justify their actions should not be the position to control user's access to content in the first place.

Is the need for Mod transparency on these decisions not clear? Do we disagree on that most basic of points?
