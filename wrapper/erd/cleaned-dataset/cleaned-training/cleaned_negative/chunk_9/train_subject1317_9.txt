 That OJ chase was a really big deal. Kind of made the white bronco legendary like the Smokey and the Bandit Trans Am, KITT, or the General Lee. 




 I hear they may be. Saw a prototype doing the auto show rounds over the winter. 




 Yes, but you generally use lower compression pistons in a supercharged or turbocharged application. 




 LOL maybe, but they built the short block rather stout from the get go. 1000+ HP has already happened on stock internals. 














 Gotta be Cru Jones. Winning at Hell Track really changed him... 




 Clarification: The optional F2 ProCharger head unit is capable of supporting 1600HP. Not sure if the internals are rated to handle 1600HP BUT it is a low compression, all forged rotating assembly from the factory.
