 This made me giggle! I love it! Beautiful pup! 




 He probably only has to fill it once a year. 




 We've seen them in some really random places, but this one just blew me away.  









 They are such wonderful, intelligent, and loving dogs. I fell in love with him the moment I saw him. He was the runt. The discount puppy (free because they were going to put him down), and I can't imagine his litter mates turning out any bigger or more beautiful than him. He's quite an amazing pup! 




 I plan on it! He's just gorgeous! 




 Thank you so much! 




 He's a German shorthaired pointer. 




 This was taken in Utah. 




 Utah 




 Thank you! 




 Utah, his first road trip out of Oklahoma. 




 Thank you! He's a tough one to photograph. He will never stay still long enough! 














 You have to quarantine them in your home for 180 days or in a quarantine facility in Japan after arriving, if the 180 days are not up, to ensure they are free of rabies. 




 Okinawa. 




 Hahaha! That's awesome! Such a pretty kitty!! 




 We moved to Japan and he became severely matted during the transport. 




 This is by far the best I've seen! I love love love it!!! Thank you!!!! 




 Yes, my husband is. 




 It's really amazing! The food is to die for, the beaches are breathtaking. The people are sooo polite. I'm really loving it. 




 He is a Maine coon... Very long haired. 




 We just moved to Okinawa, Japan. There isn't really a winter... 




 I'm not sure if he knows or not. My other cat keeps hissing at him and they are best friends of 3.5 years. He had a beautiful coat before. I will let it grow back out.
