 that was my thought as well. I just want the team to stay around, moving to MLS ensures that whereas the needless competition with another soccer team in the cities would most likely dissolve the team. Already the Silverbacks are on borrowed time thanks to MLSAtlanta 




 as an estranged Chicago Fire fan, I agree

 100% agree. I think he should be starting 



















































































































































































 exactly. large enough and usually lacking any serious pro sport team 




 I'd rather see NASL expand into the South than just Florida--places like Nashville, Memphis,   Birmingham.  

I don't think enough people give expansion into the Southwest proper shrift. El Paso, Albuquerque,   Tucson would be nice fits.  

I think Calgary should be a priority in Canada over Hamilton (though I like the idea of Hamilton). And Omaha would be a great bridge city too  

West coast proper it would have to be San Francisco or Sacramento, San Diego, and even though it's a sad city Fresno. 









 yeah, more than understandable 




 after traveling to watch the Loons in Indy, my wife is seriously considering taking off to see them against St. Louis. it's a 4 hr drive for us from Kansas. be nice to see other Dark Clouds 













































































































 I just finished a Goodreads giveaway, but I'm continuing to offer a deal. If you buy the paperback of my second book [Winterfinding](https://www.createspace.com/5321664), then I'll send you a free ebook copy (PDF, MOBI, or EPUB, your choice) of the first novel in the series, [Adversaries Together](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/updated-edition-of-adversaries-together/) 



















 I think for the non-affiliated USL teams, eying NASL makes sense. seems like it would be the best path to sustainable growth
 




 You think Milwaukee is part of the West? 









 follow the links   off the artist's Tumblr there are prints for sale 




 sorry, didn't know. 




 I really just suggested rice as an afterthought for others. Maybe couscous instead? I skipped the rice for my plate 









 good ideas all, but I like my peanut sauce thick so it works for me 




 all good ideas, thx for sharing them with me. I'm still a noob when it comes to cooking so a lot of my stuff is trial   error. 




 [Sriracha Peanut Chicken](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/05/04/foodisphere-sriracha-peanut-sauce-chicken/)   

Peanut sauce was relatively easy to do consisting of only three ingredients:  
1 cup Natural Peanut Butter  
1 tablespoon sriracha  
Quarter cup coconut oil  
Add all three into a pan, stir on low for about fifteen minutes or until smooth. Set aside.

Sriracha Peanut Chicken  

Ingredients:  
1 cup of natural peanut butter  
1-2 teaspoons of red curry paste  
quarter cup of coconut oil  
1 tablespoon sriracha (or to taste)  
1 pound of chicken breast tenders/chicken breast cut into cubes 

Directions:  
Heat your pan on low. Add coconut oil and red curry paste and stir until mixed. Add peanut butter in stages and stir. You might want to increase the heat slightly (depending on your stove) but I wouldnt go much over the low setting which should be enough to make the sauce creamy. Once smooth and creamy, add the chicken cubes. Stir the chicken in the sauce to make sure its as covered as possible. Cover the pan and let the chicken cook. Check on it occasionally and stir so that the sauce doesnt burn to the pan. I also added about a half cup of water once the sauce started to thicken around the chicken just to keep it relatively smooth rather than gloppy.  

Cook for 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Serve on rice with the peanut sauce.

 sorry for mucking up the thread. will do a better job of adhering to the guidelines in the future. thanks for getting in touch   explaining 



















 To you your first point, I agree. Asking the questions was less about quality and more about just how am I (if I am) crafting an inclusive work.  To your second point, you're right. When I originally thought of the story I wanted to have my 'hero' be trans but then I realized I wasn't knowledgeable enough to write a convincing character. Still hoping to in the future.
 















































































 thanks for this information, looks like a good site. unfortunately, $300 is well too far out of my price range 




 good idea, I just may. thank you 




 I think a team in Hartford would be great. But I'm concerned that Western expansion should be what's given top priority, rather than another Eastern team. That said, if there had been a team in Hartford when I was enduring New Haven for seven years, I would have been a season ticket holder 




 Menjivar is an everyday starter and with the right teammates and minutes could really bloom into a star. San Antonio made a big mistake 




 that looks like a fun sub idea 




 thx, definitely something to consider 




 that was my instinct but I've got precious little budget 




 thx. will give them a look. lots of great artists on DeviantArt but I worry I wouldn't be able to compensate them enough to make it worth their while 




 So it seems that folks hate my book covers. Whatever. I get it. I don't agree, but I get it. But I don't think I make enough to afford a real artist to create a cover. Does anyone have any suggestions about how to find or query artists? 









 Was thinking about what makes someone attached to a place, why they think of themselves as one thing and not another.
