 When playing GTA, I have gotten bored and at times decided to do this. Here are some examples,

- Standing on top of a building with a sniper rifle and waiting to shoot the passenger of a convertible. (Kennedy assassination)

- Shooting up a fast food resturant. (San Ysidro McDonalds Massacre)

- Flying a commercial jet into a skyscraper while shouting "Death to America" and "Allahu Akhbar" in a mock Middle Eastern accent. (9/11)

- Doing typical GTA rampages in a black Senitnel (BMW 3 series coupe) since it closely resembles Elliot Rodger's car.

- I tried to see if I could find a church with an accessible interior in order to do the recent AME church shooting, but didn't find one.

 If you don't agreee with the drinking age, let your anger out on the politicians and MADD instead of your server.

 Inbreeding was common among royal families of the past.

 This is the kind of shit that makes me loathe my generation. 




 saw a car pull up beside me and I thought that he was going through

So I guess you would've gone through too if he also did. ~~That'd make for some real good first world anarchy.~~ Have some self-control and pay attention to the light, not the other drivers. 




 The current Nissan Altima is about as big as the Maxima of the early 00s and the current Mercedes C-Class is about as big as a W210. 
























 RX7 














 The Mercedes E Class is available as a sedan, wagon, coupe, and convertible and so was/is the BMW 3 Series. The Audi A3 is available as a sedan, wagon, convertible, and hatchback. Up until the about the 70's or 80's, most mainstream American and Japanese cars such as the Chevrolet Impala or Datsun 510 came in a full range of body styles. My guess as to why this ended is because the demand for coupes and wagons is no longer big enough for non-luxury manufacturers to offer a full line like this. 




 The SL has been losing it lately and that redesign looks pretty good. Also, is seems weird to me that back in the 70's and early 80's the SLC was a 2+2 version of the SL, but now it's going to be the compact roadster. 



















 Why can't he at least be clever like this guy?

 Probably just some dealer add-on package. 




 Honda Fit, Civic, Toyota Corolla.

 Nice Jew nose. 









 Looks like a young Elliot Rodger. 




 You're not helping.

 Miley? 









 A cult-like group of people who oppose automation will form automation-free communities where they choose to live like it's the past. They will be either mocked by everybody else for being out of touch or live off tourist money like the Amish. 




 A lot of high schoolers these days emulate the "frat" lifestyle and way of dress.

 Looked like a girl in the thumbnail. 









 That would take the basic muscle car formula (largest, most powerful engine in the smallest car) to a new level. 




 E63 Coupe? 




 Man jaw 




 Yeah, it's weird how the SLC was the larger coupe in the 70s, but now it's going to be the two seat roadster. 




 Poor attempt at rapping and crappy filters. 









 She looks like a man.

 Probably most American cars from the 40s, 50s, and 60s. 









 I noticed that brown thing in the background that looks like an old Cadillac. 




 Cadillac, in 1970, still had it all together and were still producing what were seen as the premier American luxury car. As the decade went on, they became bigger and more garish, until they downsized in 1977. From 1971 on, they also cheapened their cars and decreased quality control. By the mid 1980's they came out with the downsized, front-wheel-drive econobox looking Cimarron, DeVille, Eldorado, and Seville. The cars also became more attainable from 1971 on, and more so by the 80's, competing with less prestigious Buicks, Oldsmobiles, Chryslers, and Mercurys. Currently, Mercedes-Benz still makes good cars, but some of them are relatively garish and they also recently introduced the lower priced, standard front wheel drive CLA and GLA. The CLA and GLA compete to an extent with loaded Toyotas, Hondas, Chevys, etc. Both brands seem to have introduced lower-priced models to profit off their preceived prestige that was acquired over many decades. 














 Makes sense, I see far more debadged CLAs, GLAs, C-Classes, 3-Series, A3s, and A4s than I see say, E and S-Classes.

 If you think thats bad, look up Rich Kids of Instagram. 




 What ever happened to domestic rice? 




 How can the 1980s Lincoln Town Car be so similar to a Rolls-Royce and have stayed on the market for a full decade? 









 Is it one of those shows where everybody brings their 35 year old beater or rice burner Civic and calls it a car show? 














 As a regular reader of [Curbside Classic](http://www.curbsideclassic.com), and an occasional reader of [Old Parked Cars](http://www.oldparkedcars.com), two sites based in Portland that write mainly about old cars that are not in show condition and have been found parked on the streets by their authors, I was expecting to see a lot more old shitboxes. In particular, I was surprised that these albums didn't include a bunch of diesel Benzes and 70s-80s American cars (in both poor and well maintained condition, but generally poor), as those sites seem to make those types of cars seem really common there. The Saabs, Volvos, E30s, Benzes, Eagle Premier, and Japanese cars however, are in line with their typical fodder. 




 OP already stated that there is no such thing as an S45. 




 There is no such thing as an S45 AMG. 









 Just had to post this: https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3038/2617328775_3b5c600e2c_z.jpg?zz=1 




 I guess to be unique. Kind of reminds me of how I used to think it would be a cool idea to buy a BMW or Benz and rebadge it as a 525tds, E280, or whatever other model not available in the US so that it would look like I were driving a Euro model and feel like a diplomat. 









 Also, you wouldn't be able to import it into the US for another 7 years.

OP's post history indicates that he is from Qatar. 









 This is how you know a car is becoming affordable. 




 Cars like the Mercedes S-Class and new generation BMW 7-Series have so much tech and driver aids. They also have higher powered engines and lighter materieals that in the past. What could the next generations of these cars be like? More tech?, self-driving?, or just further improved rehashes of the same thing we have now? 












































 GTA pedestrians in real life. 




 The Buick Regal and Lesabre weren't exactly cars that the public oohed and ahhhed over.

From regularly reading Curbside Classic, I've heard that Regals and Cutlasses were considered aspirational vehicles in middle America during their time. They had a reputation as a middle class "I made it" or "I've grown up" car in a way similar to how people today view the BMW 3 Series. 




 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT

BMW M4

E46, E92 M3 - Have been called the last of the "Analog" M3s.

Dodge Challenger and Charger Hellcat - The ultimate muscle cars at this point.

Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8

Chrysler 300 SRT8 




 Buick GNX, Grand National, T-Type, Lesabre Turbo, etc. They were all high performance versions of otherwise staid luxury cars with more agressive, sportier styling, similar to what AMG does with Mercedes-Benzes. 





























 Does this count? http://i.imgur.com/mGdqzQF.jpg

 Cancer kicked his ass. 














 When I see a car broken down on the side of the road, it generally seems to either be a 15-25 year old German luxury car or a 10-20 year old GM econobox.

 I hope to god this never happens. 




 Would the world population be lower or higher? On one hand, sociopaths tend to be more sexually active since they have low impulse control and a high sex drive, on the other hand, they are more likely to kill since they don't value human life. 




 Not this again  



















 That's how Lexus, Infiniti and Acura all started. 




 But it just seems strange that their direct competitors offer comparable cars in the US but Audi hasn't attempted to compete with them here. E.g. A5 Sportback is similar to 6 Gran Coupe and CLS and RS6 is similar to E63 AMG S and M5 Competition package. 









 They don't give us the RS3, S3 Avant, RS4, RS6, and A5 sportback, even if some of these cars have their direct competitors' counterparts sold here. 



















 I was thinking about trolling /r/futurology with this.
