 I can't believe that Louis Armstrong is not on these lists!  Come on folks, he invented Jazz singing. 




 Big upvotes for Blossom Dearie and Cecile McLorin Salvant.   




 I agree Anita and Ella were the great Verve rivals, and as a pure Jazz singer Anita might have had an edge.   




 Well, that makes it right then.  




 As the mod of the /r/badlawyer subreddit I can attest to this.  Really it's fraud, perjury, theft, and violence that will get you tossed.  Amazingly though, there is a former major crime prosecutor in Cleveland who while coked up shot his girlfriend at close range; went to prison for 7 years; and, who was reinstated.  Amazingly the same court disbarred a longtime civil attorney who didn't file and didn't pay income taxes (no fraud involved.)   Go figure. 




 Great suggestion by /u/Ihearcolor -- I'd also suggest that you stay close to us.  Do the daily check-in and share here with us.  We're not like the rest of Reddit.  This is a full on support subreddit and snark-free zone. 




 You're doing it right double-D! 









 True.

 Yeah, the irony. 









 You pull this sort of shit with the feds you get an obstruction of justice charge. 












































 LOL--in Cleveland we have a couple of days off. 




 I had a great Heineken t-shirt that said, Grab a Heinie.  I loved it.  It became a paint t-shirt when I stopped drinking.  Then a rag. 




 Here's what I did when I was learning (and I'm far from a master)--off the bike in off season focus on abs and squats.  Strengthen your core muscles, but get super strong at the hover squat position by sitting on a stool and rising and holding at 4 inches, 6 inches, and then controlled seating (not collapsing back onto the stool).  Then as you ride, learn to jump up from the saddle and use your body weight to push the pedal down, alternate with sitting and riding at a higher rev.  Then back up on the pedals.  This should become instinctive.  Good luck. 




 Hooray!   




 Yeah, bad role model. I'd find a new sponsor.  BTW, I have a co-sponsor that I totally admire but this is his Achilles.  Since he's my co-sponsor this issue bothers me not at all.  It's his character defect. 




 I think this is great.  We get lots of username changes for this stated reason.  It's sort of like losing the beer t-shirt after being in recovery for some time. 









 You know the way, /u/gonegirl1022--focus on not drinking TODAY, and plan to make the same decision tomorrow. Good luck. 




 When you ride a bike, don't think about your destination instead think about how beautiful the ride is, how great the pedal stroke feel is, how you want to be right where you are right now--then lean in.

 Optics.  He's failing at optics. 




 I think it is so true that anniversaries, mile marker celebrations are super important for the reasons you stated, Slip.  I like to point out to newcomers with 7 days, 14 days, 30, 60, 90 days that their achievement of those milestones lend credibility to what they say about the journey that someone with years (and in your case, decades) can not have.  But, as always you paint a poignant picture, my friend.  Thank you. 



















 Yes, ELECT ME and I'll take you to war in the Middle East.

 Congratulations on 600 days!  It gets real. 




 Welcome /u/megame23 -- at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It lays out how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  When you're up to it, maybe there are some ideas there that will make sense to you.  Good luck, I hope you join us. 




 Welcome /u/Jadiki to r/stopdrinking.  I thought I'd share the [link to the Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) with you.  It's what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I try to share it as part of the "handshake at the door" to the SD sober journey.  Good luck to you. 




 Ah, yes, the courage of media whoredom.

 This is what Obama asserted was the only alternative offered by critics of the Iran-Nuke Deal.   How cool would that be?  War with Iran, sheesh, these people are idiots.

 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what; honestly, keeping SOBER in Cleveland Thursday.  Beautiful weather today, and I'm happily bike commuting. 




 Not let's see, what might be Sen. Menedez's position on the Iran Nuke deal? 









 This reminds me of the quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson that was in my first comment at the original Honesty Week post:

"Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.

From this I take: judge the truth to yourself and speak it to yourself and if necessary to others; but be open to the idea that what you take as fact may not be fact and so you have an obligation to correct not only your mistaken belief, but speak the truth to others even at the cost of pride and ego.

 Incredibly smart post.

 Go into lakewood park and walk due north to the lake.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of construction there now, so I don't know how close you can get to it.   




 I am sorry that this was your experience.  When I got sober in 1986 (for the first 15 years) the only "loss" I thought I had sustained was my relationship with my first wife who had been my childhood sweetheart.  I did lose that relationship but like JBH I was able SOBER to sit down with her one time and express my sincere regret.  Unlike JBH it was way too early in my recovery and I'm afraid it sounded like nothing but words, meaningless words.  And the damage I had done by then was not repairable with words.  As JBH points out, honest words gain credibility with honest actions. 









 I am not going to drink TODAY in solidarity with you. 




 Wow, awesome!  I see where Slip has already added you to DINOs. 




 Bridgegate 




 LOL, I'm amused and all you had to do was describe the idea. 




 Thank you for being having the courage to be honest.

I would encourage you to go back through your post and comment history and try and get as honest a grip as you can on why you decided to stop drinking and stay stopped.  Why was it important in the first place?  And now, what do you think you're missing? 

You know if you ever read [my Saturday Share](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/) how relapse worked out for me, so I'm not going to lecture you.  I will say that if I knew then what I know now--I would have begged my friends to lock me away until the impulse passed.  I barely averted death, for what?  To pour alcohol down my face!  What a waste.

My friend, I understand the impulse.  If you spend anytime sober you probably can't avoid the thought that you're missing something.  New craft beers, fine wines, parties, events, sophistication--in my experience it was all tears and ashes and tragedy.

 Hang on to the hope, it lights the way. 




 This "terrible," "awful" deal is all about engagement with historic enemies.  




 Double-D this is a delight. 




 I'm not good with internet hugs; but I will offer you some hope.  

My marriage was past due for divorce when I returned to sobriety in 2009.  We both had had destructive affairs. My HS sophomore son was trying to figure out if he was gay; my HS senior daughter was pregnant.  I was losing my professional license AND going to federal prison.  

Flash forward nearly 6 years, we are still married and very close and affectionate.  Life is complicated and relationships are complex.  My son is an award winning professional actor, comedian, and college student; my daughter is a college student; and, my grandson who lives with us, is the light of my life. 

What changed?  

Me.  I changed.  I got sober and stayed sober.  I dealt with my legal consequences honestly.  I went to counseling and stuck with it.  When my daughter needed recovery I was at every family night.  I did not change my wife or kids, I changed ME.  And as I changed everything around me changed.

 









 I am half-way through this bio-history by Tim Weiner and it is bringing it all back into sharp focus and with almost all of the mysteries surrounding these years--solved.  Riveting is not too strong a word. 









 Overdue process. 




  What is wrong with citizens expressing their concerns about the military potentially infringing on their rights?

None whatsoever.  

But if this is the first you've heard about it, then you have been living overseas or off the grid.   




 This is really strange.  When the folks (including CJ Maureen O'Connor) claim judges need a pay raise because they are overworked and underpaid, Judges like Russo graphically illustrate why this is bullshit.   




 Missed it; thanks. 














 I think this is right.  Here's what I KNOW happened: he enters a guilty plea to a federal felony and as part of the pre-sentencing process there is a standard psychological assessment that turns up paranoid and delusional disorders that are concerning to US Probation and the Bureau of Prisons.  As his behavior under their supervision becomes more bizarre--instead of sending him to prison the US District Court seeks a mental health assessment and recommendation. 


































 This is one of the major steps forward in my life when I got sober.  I decided that I would "give in" to the world as it is; not as I would have it be.  When I did this everything got better.  As a metaphor, it's like a lot of athletic endeavors: when you ski, road cycling, play tennis--if you let go and lean in, counter-intuitively you gain control.  I had to stop "forcing" myself on the world. 












































 Love it! 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; another SOBER hump day in Cleveland. 














 Hey, /u/swiggitty -- I'm glad you came out of lurk and posted.  Welcome to the sub. 




 What worked for me was getting a support network in place BEFORE I set out to confess my sins, or make amends.  The wisdom of others was essential to me in avoiding unnecessary pain on those I hurt.  I'm not saying that I was taken off the hook in any respect--but, I found effective ways of getting honest and making appropriate amends.  Hard on myself, easy on others was a good rule of thumb for me. 



















 You probably can't read the new posts and comments on /r/stopdrinking for anytime without coming across a slew of posts in which newcomers talk movingly about shame, guilt, remorse, and regret over past misdeeds.  Most of our misdeeds, as bad as they were, harmed only ourselves, but usually we hurt close family, friends and co-workers.  If you are anything at all like me you wanted a clean conscience and you felt the immediate compulsion to run out and confess and apologize.  STOP.

Honesty does require amends, often confession or apologies but as I said yesterday in my [Brutal Honesty post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3d67e1/brutal_honesty_is_not_honesty_its_mostly_just/) don't confuse honesty with brutality.  Our need to get honest is not a license to HURT others.  Ever.  

So how do we move forward to right past wrongs? 




 AA meetings helped save my life, but I augmented them with seeing a psychologist in my early days sober.   




 Glad you made it into the lifeboat.  When I came back from a relapse in 2009 I was losing my professional license, and going to prison.  I got sober and changed my entire life. 




 Why not go to an AA meeting?  I would if I felt like you feel, in fact I go when I'm feeling great. 




 Hey, /u/Kev131 -- did I share the [Baby Steps post with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Maybe something in what I did to stop drinking and get sober will be helpful to you. 




 Welcome /u/Allied_Biscuit to /r/stopdrinking  Maybe you aren't an alcoholic but living without booze makes a lot of sense.  One of my closest friends in the World is a leading Class Action attorney and philanthropist--a total teetotaler.  Like you he had a family history of alcoholism and he CHOSE to not drink.  And yet he is the life of any party he's at.  So at this [link is the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which summarizes what I did to stop drinking and stay stopped.  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.  Good luck. 




 Ha, ha, ... perfect. 














 Sorry.  I probably wouldn't have posted the link at all but one of the newer mods took down my link to the TimesDispatch story about the Circuit affirmance of the corruption conviction as off-topic.  This article points out why it is totally on-topic. 




 Beautiful comment.  It gives me goosebumps. 




 Surly Long Haul Trucker 



















 Great update.  Good luck on the interview! 




 Welcome /u/Garrosh1981 to r/stopdrinking--I did (and do) the [things I describe at the Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I see you're hesitant about AA meetings, so was I.  I'm glad I went though.

Good luck to you and welcome aboard. 




 I love traveling sober.  I hit up AA meetings wherever I go: Cape Cod, Florida, Chicago, NY, Toronto, even...just out of town.  It's a remarkable way to get out of the tourist or travel bubble and feel at home anywhere. 









 Pretty much the standard advice for newcomers to /r/stopdrinking who don't really know if they want "to quit drinking" and who consider themselves "borderline" is--don't quit.  Quitting drinking implies permanence.  Instead STOP drinking for 30, 60 or 90 days and see if abstinence helps you get some clarity about your relationship with alcohol.  

Of course, many of us feel tremendous empathy for your horrible childhood, but it's not that unique in reality.  There are those of us with much better and those of us with much worse upbringing. Many of us can wallow in the misery of the memory of rotten parentage.  The question really is: what do you want to do with your life.  Personally, I chose to live and free myself from the legacy.  I do something I call [the Baby Steps every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) to stop drinking and to get sober.  Thus far I'm in a far better place than I've ever been.  Come jump in the lifeboat, if only for a month or two.  Begin with a decision not to drink TODAY, only.  Good luck. 




 In recovery, (for me, AA meetings) there are systematic ways of approaching the changes I needed to make and a process for making amends to the people I hurt.  Meditation is a huge part of that process in my experience. 




 Great comment.   




 Keep using this forum for this confessional or any other sober purpose; we are your support community focused on helping one another stop drinking.

 Cool! 









 I appreciate your post and observations.  Like a lot of things in early recovery, sustained time sober often results in an epiphany or sudden alterations in perception.  While I might not have appreciated why such a big deal is being made about this or that among my support group--time sober and suddenly I can see how huge an idea is and how it really plays out in my own life.  At least that's how I experience some of these things.  I needed to keep my eyes open.   




 Just great. 



























































 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; staying honest in Cleveland. 




 Great!. Keep doing what you're doing. 




 Honesty is freedom in our relationships.  Good work, my friend.
