 A high sodium intake will make you look bloated and it will make you heavier on the scale due to water weight, but it won't actually increase adipose tissue percentage. Sodium contains 0 calories, and so it doesn't actually go through your body's metabolic pathway.  




 Unless you've been diagnosed with anorexia or some other related disorder by a health specialist and you literally look shredded to the bone, I'd argue that this is very unlikely. Simply put, if it jiggles it's fat, and if there's still clearly visible fat, then there's still fat to lose. Plain and simple.  




 Hats off to you, my friend! Congratulations on your achievements so far and I'm sure it's just the beginning!  




 When I was at 25% body fat... People told me 'wow, you look good now!', yet I had a clear belly, had low self esteem and thought of myself as an ugly fatass back then... 

When I was at 20%, people told me 'you're good, you don't need to lose weight anymore!' Still had no visible abs, still thought I was ugly, still didn't like myself, kept going...

When I was at 15%, people told me 'dude, your dedication is amazing, and your physique too, but I think you can stop now'... Bullshit, I still saw no abs, still had plenty of excess fat...

Then, after 6 years and a half, at the age of 21, I finally hit 10% or close to it. Now people weren't saying 'you don't need to lose weight anymore', they were saying 'dude, amazing lean muscular body! How'd you do it?'

Morale of the story? Whatever people tell you, smile, ignore them, and keep doing your thing. People will be unable to understand, they will be jealous, they will claim to be supporting and helping you, yet most of what they will be doing is throwing their laziness and ignorance in your face. It will be hard, but their negative thoughts, beliefs and attitudes will serve as the fuel that will help you keep going when you will barely be able to hold on, when it will feel like the hunger is literally killing you from the inside, when you'll be so tired that every single regular workout will feel like crossing a mountain. 

You may not relate, but that's my experience anyway. I had no support from anyone, not from my relatives, not my friends, not from my co-workers, not from my classmates. They all had shitty eating habits when I started, and they still do to this day, and they never helped me in anyway whatsoever or tried to understand how I felt.

But all along, all I could think of was how gratifying it would feel to manage to push the limits of mental fortitude and discipline, and to see the beauty of which my body was capable with the right knowledge and work ethics. And I can tell you from personal experience now: it is indeed the best feeling that I have ever experienced. There is nothing quite like looking at yourself in the mirror every morning and telling yourself that this amazing body that you have is the result of YOUR own hard work!

And it sounds strange to say, but with their support, I don't think I would have succeeded as well. Their negativity made me who I am today, for better and worse. I became quite cynical and alienated, but I am closer than ever to the body of my dreams and it is healthier than it has been in my entire life prior to now.  

And I don't know who the author is, but my favorite saying now is: 'OBSESSED' is merely a word the LAZY use to describe the DEDICATED!  









 Bloating is mostly dependent on diet and on whether or not you're using the appropriate drug. Sure, these compounds induce bloating quite a lot, but you can always minimize it by eating clean and having an AI on hand.  




 Going to start my first cycle in 2 months from now. I'm currently at 12-13% adipose tissue (I can tell because my rectus abdominis and external oblique muscles are clearly visible). Goal is to drop to 10% in order to minimize the estrogen conversion rate, and then inject 500 mg of testosterone enanthate weekly for 12 weeks. I'll be using an aromatase inhibitor from week 1 to 14 (might stop earlier if no early gynecomastia onset), and 2 SERMs from week 15 to 17. 

Stats: 

Age: 22

Height: 6 ft.

Weight: 185 (12-13% at)

Training experience: 6 years

Diet will be isocaloric, with fructose and sucrose consumption in the morning and post workout only, 4 even and evenly spaced out meals, 500 calories above TDEE.

Workout will be full body workout style routine first month and a half, either GVT or FST-7 in the second month. I will be using various supplements, including a liver support one (yes, liver support is important even if you're not running an oral compound), but I won't post the names unless someone asks me because the list is long. 

Might also run one or two daily doses of GHRP/GHRH during those 3 months, haven't decided yet if I feel like spending an extra $200 on injection gear lol.  




 Yes, but most products that contain cocoa also contain sugar, unless you buy unsweetened cocoa powder or another form of pure cocoa.  














 If you're eating milk chocolate or candy, there's a problem with your diet to begin with, and that problem won't be solved by replacing it with a slightly less unhealthy substitute. The problem with cocoa is that it's highly caloric and yet not very filling, meaning an overweight person can easily eat 800 calories worth of 80% dark chocolate and still be hungry 30 min later. Chocolate should be avoided altogether for those who wish to lose weight, IMO, its only benefits are the micro nutrients and these can be found in much healthier food products.  









 The only thing that is beneficial in cocoa is the micro nutrients, which can be found in other food products that aren't as caloric or rich in sugar, such as some fruits and vegetables to give only one example.  









 In my opinion, this discrepancy between hunger and energy expenditure is the reason why rapidly reaching a new 'weight loss' low in the overweight   obese is simply not an effective long-term solution. If you're an experienced athlete who 'nasty bulked' for 3 months and now wish to go back to your pre-bulk weight, then sure, going on a relatively big caloric deficit or even using a dangerous drug such as 2,4-Dinitrophenol might work. But if you're obese or overweight and you want to go from there to a 'visible six pack weight', first, it has to be slow and steady, and second, you have to accept the fact that there will be mental pain from hunger and all you can do is resist it and minimize it by eating lots of dietary fibers and other nutrients that increase the 'gastric fullness' effect that can be obtained from eating. I have been there. Being hungry all the time is hard, but right now, given what we understand of the human physiology, there seems to be no other way.

 I have been questioning their findings as well. IMO there's a lot of evidence that BCAA availability is one of the factors for mTORC1 pathway stimulation and subsequent proliferation of muscle tissue cells.  









 I would question their methodology and subsequent findings. There is evidence that certain BCAAs, especially leucine, increase proliferation and activation of skeletal muscle cells via the mTORC1 pathway. 




 'Conclusion:The damaged muscle was **not** able to get benefits out of the increased plasma branched-chain amino acids availability to attenuate changes in indirect markers of muscle damage and muscle metabolic alterations following exercise-induced muscle damage.' 



















 I don't eat at Mcdonalds ever but I don't think it's as bad as a lot of people think. It's only bad because people use going there as an excuse to stuff their face.  




 Apologies for misunderstanding then. Like I said, I just think that what I inferred from my own pieces of information was plain wrong.  




 I think you're saying that because you didn't really understand any of what I wrote. 'Outrageously wrong' is some big words. I think all the information I gave out is true, but that my assumption that it equals in it being physiologically impossible to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time is very short sighted, I'll give you that. I didn't take into account the fact that, even though fat is in fact always being produced via the mTORC1 pathway, it is balanced out by the fact that some of that fat is also constantly being oxidized to produce energy, like you said.  









 There are no plateaus when it comes to fat loss... Either your scale weight is affected by other factors, like water weight, due to your nutritional choices, or you need to adjust your caloric intake. If you're at a daily deficit, you're losing weight period.  









 Thanks for your input. I really appreciate that type of well written answer.  




 What exactly are you calling bullshit here?  









 This is troubling to say the least... In this study they discovered that high fructose consumption creates a vicious circle that can ultimately lead to death. High blood pressure causes the heart to require a larger supply of oxygen, and when the body cannot produce enough of that from fatty acids, it will start using sugar instead, by causing the liver to metabolize more fructose. However, fructose in itself raises blood pressure, so this sets off a dangerous chain reaction of which the final outcome is heart failure.

 If I'm not mistaken, ageing-related disease risk is already being treated with second generation mTORC1 pathway inhibitors. 

mTORC1 over stimulation is already well known to be associated with various diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer's disease.  




 I sincerely hope it works out for your boys, sir! (or madam!)

They live in a formidable era of technological advancements, that is for sure.  




 To add to what you said, the baroreflex is basically a mechanism by which specialized neurons found in the blood vessels of mammals known as 'baroreceptors' communicate blood pressure information to the posterior part of the brain so  homeostatis can be maintained. The baroreceptors 'measure' blood pressure and when it is inappropriately elevated, the baroreflex react accordingly by increasing the amount of water in the bloodstream.  




 This is the first time that scientists have demonstrated the neurological mechanisms by which dietary salt can promote hypertension. Pretty interesting to read.  
























 Nice discovery, but gene therapy has already been used to treat muscular dystrophy. Recently, Follistatin, an inhibitor of the TGF- superfamily of proteins (which include myostatin, a gene that limits the growth of muscular tissue in humans), has been injected into children suffering from muscular diseases using an adeno-associated virus in order to successfully treat them. After 2 weeks of regular injection, the children had increased muscular mass and strength and were able to actually walk and could function more 'normally'. 

Study is available [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322757).  














 Actual gold.  









 Steroids are used by the vast majority of professional athletes throughout the world.... It's not just North Korea. =/ 



















 The long-term effects of caloric restriction on humans are unknown. We can only hypothesize. No longitudinal study has ever been conducted.  




 This quote has been used too many times, now it's cheesy.  









 Yes, speculation. But there needs to be more research in order to test these theories on actual subjects.  




 Sadly, I don't have answers to these questions. More research needs to be done to answer these, but research on human subjects in the fields of biochemistry and nutrition is costly and hard to make reliable...  




 The ignorance is giving me a headache...  




 If I might be selfish, I would really like to see some more research done on the long-term effects of sustaining a high fat and low/no carbohydrate diet on fatty acid utilization during high intensity exercise in athletes.  




 The mTORC1 pathway is always activated unless you are ingesting literally no calories.

To answer your second question, the mTORC1 pathway is, simply put, a double edged sword, in that, the more it is stimulated, and the more muscular and fat tissues will be produced.  

And for your third question, I never eat dairy when I'm cutting, but I cannot attest as to whether it makes more of a difference in practice than being at a caloric deficit alone would. But based on the research I've done, it most definitely does.  




 Simply put, eating more dairy products is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as it will result in increased production of both muscular and fat tissues.  




 I know this is going to be somewhat complex science, but please keep an open mind as you read. I want to show you some of the science behind why, beyond just caloric intake, nutrient choices actually affect one's ability to lose/gain weight. I have amassed a vast amount of research over the recent years and I now firmly believe that, for optimal weight loss, one should avoid dietary proteins from a dairy source and, instead, eat mostly ones that come from certain animal/meat sources. 

The reasons for this have to do with a vastly complex biological structure in the body known as 'mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1' (mTORC1). mTORC1 is a protein multicomplex. To understand what a protein multicomplex is, one must first understand the basics of biology and biochemistry in relation to human physiology. One of the most important organic compounds in the human body is the amino acid. Amino acids are formed with the most basic elements of life as well as almost everything that exists - the chemical elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. There are hundreds of known amino acids, but the ones of interest here are the twenty three ones that are said to be 'proteinogenic', meaning they are used to form proteins, the molecules that perform virtually every single physiological process in humans. When you eat foods that contain proteins, those are broken by the digestive system into amino acids, and these are then used to reform proteins involved in various physiological processes.

How are amino acids used to form proteins? Well, simply put, they are combined together with a bond and into chains known as 'peptide chains', and these chains are in turn combined together to form proteins. Sometimes, however, a larger-than-usual number of peptide chains will be put together, resulting in a protein multicomplex, a vastly complex multi-task molecular structure. An example of that, like I said, is mTORC1.  

The role of mTORC1 is essentially to 'create' and then 'activate' all other proteins in the body, and its functioning depends on the availability of certain nutrients and growth factors. In other words, it is responsible for the production of all tissues in the body, including muscular and fat tissues. In the context of weight gain/loss, the more mTORC1 is stimulated, and the more adipose tissue is produced, and vice versa. So, in order to lose fat optimally, you need to not only shrink the body's fat cells by forcing it to use its own reserves of nutrients, but also to limit mTORC1 stimulation. The first factor is achieved almost exclusively by being at a daily caloric deficit over an extended period of time, but the second one is achieved through other means as well. And this is where the relationship between dairy and animal/meat proteins comes in. 

Basically, mTORC1 stimulation is dependent, like mentioned above, on five elements that relate to nutrient and growth factor availability:

1) the presence of two hormones, insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1);

2) sufficient cellular energy (ATP, which is produced via processing of ingested nutrients from food in the body's main metabolic pathway);

3) the presence of essential branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), especially leucine

4) the presence of another essential amino acid, glutamine

5) the presence of saturated fatty acids, especially palmitic acid

Now let's look at all five points in relation to dairy and animal proteins and mTORC1 stimulation. 

1) Dairy proteins, particularly whole milk, cheese and whey protein, have a much greater insulinemic index than any meat protein, mainly due to the fact that they are hydrolyzed (broken down into molecules by water) much more quickly in the intestine,  thus resulting in a greater insulin and IGF-1 response and therefore greater mTORC1 stimulation as well.

2) In order to be activated, the mTORC1 pathway needs ATP, the body's unit of energy. ATP is produced in the metabolism, via the processing of nutrients from foods. Simply put, as mentioned, when foods are digested, they create an insulin response, and the role of insulin is essentially to 'push' nutrients into the metabolic pathway. Therefore, the greater the insulin response, and the more ATP the nutrients transported will produced. Also as mentioned, dairy protein foods create a greater insulin response than meat protein foods do, and therefore, they result in greater mTORC1 stimulation as well. 

3) Dairy products contain more leucine. For example, whey protein contains 14% leucine, compared to 8% for meat.

4) Glutamine has a synergistic relationship with leucine, in that it serves as a 'gatekeeper' that ensures leucine uptake by the neural pathway that leads to mTORC1. Dairy protein foods contain more glutamine than meat protein foods do. For example, milk protein has 8g of glutamine per 100g, compared to 4.75g per 100g for beef protein. 

5) Palmitic acid also promotes MTORC1 stimulation. Some of the foods richest in palmitic acid include oils, fatty meats, cheese and whole milk. However, the particularity of dairy products such as whole milk is that over 98% of their fat content is made of palmitic acid, making them especially efficient at promoting mTORC1 stimulation.  

So, to summarize, the two main ways to promote weight loss are, 1) to make the body's fat cells shrink by forcing it to use its own reserves of nutrients, this is mainly achieved by being at a caloric deficit; 2) to limit mTORC1 stimulation; mTORC1 is a protein multicomplex that is ultimately responsible for the production of all bodily tissues, including fat tissue. The second factor, like I've said, is often overlooked, but the truth is, new research is increasingly finding correlations between MTORC1 overstimulation and a vast array of diseases that have been plaguing society in recent years, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and cancer. For this reason, evolutionary novel behaviors, such as regular consumption of pasteurized milk, might prove dangerous for society in the long run, and might also very well amongst the underlying causes of the increasing rates of obesity...

 Eating 100g of pure cocoa with nothing else added, maybe. Cocoa in its natural form is an excellent source of proteins, carbohydrates and fats, rich in dietary fibers and in various vitamins and minerals, and low in sugar.  But 100g of actual chocolate, with all the sugar included? I find that hard to believe.  



















 Sodium isn't a macro nutrient, and it doesn't contain any calories. It's required in small amounts in order for your body to function properly, and, unlike what the media like you to believe, eating a little more than you're supposed to isn't extraordinarily unhealthy if you're in relative good health and live a healthy lifestyle. If you respect your target caloric intake and make appropriate food choices on a daily basis, supplementing your meals with table salt is certainly the least of your concerns IMO.  




 Yes. Most definitely! 




 Then eat less. The main determiner of whether your muscular tissue increases when lifting weights is caloric intake. If you eat more, you will pack on more fat, but also more muscle. If you lift weights while staying at caloric maintenance, on the other hand, then neither will increase; fat and muscle tissues will remain constant while strength will increase.  




 That lifting will make you 'bulky' is one of the biggest and most irritating myths to have ever been created and spread. And it spread like a cancer, too. Listen, my friend, lifting weights will NOT make you bulky, and neither will lifting 'heavy' weights. First, what WILL make you bulky by society's standards is YEARS of weight lifting combined with eating at a caloric surplus and injecting testosterone and other related compounds. 

Also, in controlled lab experiments, rep range vs weight doesn't have any impact on muscular hypertrophy what-so-ever. The only thing that lifting 'heavy' does better is increasing intracellular connections both between the various muscle groups and within each muscle group itself, in turn allowing for better linear progression in the gym.

Lifting weights alone will NEVER make you bulky. And, actually, neither will lifting weights combined with eating at a caloric surplus. You will get more muscular from doing that, yes, but certainly not 'bulky'. Increasing muscular tissue is healthy, and it's especially important as you age, as it allows you to keep functioning normally, not be weak physically, and also protects you from a vast array of aging-related diseases, such as osteoporosis.  




 I remember when I first started cleaning up my diet and being at a caloric deficit, I couldn't go on for more than 2-3 hours without putting something in my mouth. The first times I went on for long period of times (5h+) without eating anything in order to not go above my target caloric intake, I would walk around the house like a paranoid person, repeatedly opening up and then closing the fridge looking for something low in calorie that I could eat.  I would go to sleep every night feeling down quite a bit and I would dream of when I would finally wake up and eat something. I felt quite miserable pretty much on a daily basis back then, guess that's the price to pay for not giving in. It did feel great though in the morning when I would wake up and realize that I had managed to respect my caloric intake the day before, so there's that. 

But over the years, hunger has become really easy to 'resist'. In fact, it doesn't bother me anymore. I can go for 8-10 hours without eating anything, and function normally and still be happy and not go to bed craving for literally anything to eat every night. I didn't really see the process of myself becoming more 'hunger-resistant' happen, it just kind of happened after weeks and months and years of feeling like crap and irrationally dreaming about food. It wasn't sudden, I never felt like I wasn't craving as much at first, but now looking back I can definitely say that I feel better without eating than I used to a couple years ago when I started living a more healthy lifestyle. 
 

 




 Yes, but when it comes to studies on eating habits and caloric intake manipulations, humans aren't very reliable subjects... So it balances itself out, in a way.  




 Honestly, no idea. They used a newer strain of rats, known as  Brown Norway/Fischer 344 F1 hybrid rats. This is a calorie-restricted strain that is known for gaining extra longevity when used in caloric restriction experiments but for some reason it doesn't show up on any of the rat strain databases that I know of.  




 Are you implying that rat studies are not reliable?  














 If someone can edit the title, I forgot to add [Non-human subjects] to the title. This study was done on aging rats known for their extended longevity. 














 And that's where his Karma pick comes from (LPL). Just like his Nautilus pick before came from the LMS, and his Veigar pick from the LCK. Karma's been played by LPL supports pretty much since the split started. A single pro support in Korea spammed Veigar support in competitive games until it got nerfed. Nautilus support has been a flavor pick for over a year in Taiwan.

 Obviously, but this isn't the topic at hand. Thanks captain obvious.  


































 I think it depends on what you value most in life. Personally, I was traumatized by being overweight as a kid and teenager, and so as an adult maintaining my aesthetic physical appearance and healthy life habits is of the utmost importance, far more important than anything else in my life, even obsessive, and there is nothing, not any person, no matter how I feel about them, that will even come before my desire to maintain a strict lifestyle by my own standards. I understand that I might be a unique case and that it isn't like that for most people, though, I'm just speaking from personal experience.  




 tl;dr: it wasn't the relationship itself, but an increase in caloric intake caused by a lack of understand of the principles behind nutritional science and brought about by the commencement of the relationship. Like I said, poor eating habits will be poor eating habits regardless of other factors involved. There's no causal relationship like you seem to believe. You can fall in love, and have solid understanding of nutrition, and this will not happen.  




 You mean those social gathering events where people overeat by ingesting alcohol and eating foods rich in saturated fats and sugars? Impossible, I never attend such events.  



















 Are you implying that I'm wrong?  




 Sounds to me like you're looking for an excuse for your poor life habits. Dating does not mean you have to overeat. There is a wide variety of things that you can do with your partner/friends and which don't involve the action of eating.  




 The short answer is: there is no such thing as a 'plateau' when it comes to shrinking cells in adipose tissue. Simply further reduce your caloric intake, and weight loss should resume.   




 If being in a relationship makes you eat more, you're dating the wrong person. A relationship is supposed to bring something positive into your life, to enhance what you already have and therefore make you happier. If the person you're dating is hindering your weight loss progress with their life choices, like I said, it might be time to go separate ways.  




 Misleading title. There is no such thing as 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' foods, unlike what society believes out of ignorance. Caloric intake and nutrient choices are what matters, but no nutrient or nutrient combination is inherently good or bad on its own. It's the overall diet that makes the difference.  




 This. 

 




 Agreed. 




 It is. But increases in transport rate of nutrients have been shown to be a double edged sword. A simple example of that is the fact that insulin can increase transport of nutrients into skeletal muscle cells and activate ribosomal protein pathways, and yet also increases adipose tissue uptake of triglycerides and inhibits the hormone-sensitive lipase pathways. 

The role of mTORC1 is merely to activate protein translation... Whether that is a good or bad thing depends on an unimaginably high number of factors.  




 This post would be more well-suited for a sub such as r/fitness. Here, we discuss serious scientific work that relates to nutrition and physical exercise.  














 There is much safer way to induce accelerated tissue regeneration locally, it's the use of Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide and Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone compounds. On the other hand, this technique proposed here would probably be much less expensive to use in the long run.

 Still the best jungler IMO.  














 Not sure if these are serious or not, and wondering why they aren't removed.  



















 They found no difference in cognition between various macro nutrient ratios, yes.  




 Nope, most of my friends and relatives eat to socialize, understand nothing of the biochemical principles behind nutritional science, and have overall shitty life habits. I've been on my fitness journey for years, and the farther I've been into it, and the more cynical and isolated I've become. Society is ignorant, and I've come to despise ignorance quite a lot. Long story short, not supportive, except for a few of my Biochem classmates who actually understand these things. They're the people I mostly talk to nowadays.  




 http://jn.nutrition.org/content/145/4/691.short

This new study was posted in the Journal of Nutrition of the American Society for Nutrition. They tested partially hydrolized whey peptides (PHWP) and partially hydrolized gelatin (PHG), two compounds that contain branched chain amino acids, over a period of 8 weeks on women (aged 18-65) who were losing weight at a steady pace.

When they compared the results using multivariate statistical analyses, they found that the PHWP preparation caused significant improvements in regards to overall weight loss, fat to muscle tissue loss ratio, insulin action, and cardiovascular health.

Like the title states, BCAA metabolism wasn't significantly affected, but the PHWP preparation caused changes in metabolomical patterns that seemed to improve overall health in these women on a caloric deficit.  




 They found that partially hydrolized whey peptides (PHWP) and partially hydrolized gelatin (PHG) moderately improved overall weight loss ratio, fat to muscle tissue loss ratio, insulin action and cardiovascular health in obese middle aged women on a caloric deficit. When they compared the results using multivariate statistical analyses, PHWP was more significant.

When they compared the results using multivariate statistical analyses, PHWP was more significant.  




 What exactly do you not understand, tell me. I can probably answer your questions...  




 I disagree, and let me explain why.

One the reasons why people initially fail to eat less, in my experience, is because they are unable to consistently less, partly due to their nutrient choices. It's not as simple as telling a person to simply 'eat less', you have to change their nutrient choices in order to enable them to do so, or else, in some cases, they are simply not going to be able to start eating less to begin with.  









 Whoa, I apologize. For some reason I didn't even remember!!  




 How is this a repost? Pretty much sure I've never posted this before, and this doesn't seem to have been posted before by anyone else either.  



















 More sugar means a greater insulin response, which in turns means greater fat tissue uptake rate of triglycerides yes, but this only matters if you are at a caloric surplus. If I was you, I'd be much more concerned about the effects of insulin on hunger and satiety.  




 Sure, caloric intake is what matters... But nutrient choices usually decide whether people are able to consistently respect their caloric intake or not in the long run. By saying 'it's just calories in, calories out' and not at looking what you eat beyond that, you are setting yourself up for failure. I work with obese children whose family is also obese most of the time, and I have seen this happen so many times... Saying 'a calorie is a calorie' is disregarding the fact that there are undeniable differences between the effects of each macro nutrient on satiety, metabolism, hormones, etc..  




 Nope, trust me, if you know a lot about nutrition, then you know how to use the physiological processes that can prevent you from overeating. People think they're food scientists because they understand the 'calories in, calories out' concept and track their caloric intake on MyFitnessPal... It is much, much more complicated than that. Yes, at the end of the day it's about energy balance, no denying that, but nutrient choices are generally what decide whether people are able to consistently respect their caloric intake or not. Have you ever heard of someone who is on a diet of mostly fats and proteins and also obese? I sure haven't. And, in my experience, even when people track their calories, it never works very well when they eat a lot of foods that are rich in sugar and low in fibers; these people tend to go on huge binges after a while and that ruins all of their progress.  




 You weren't taught that in school, because the basic biochemical principles behind nutritional science *aren't* taught in school. This is one of the underlying roots of obesity and other metabolic diseases in my opinion... along with our cultural tendency to eat as a mean of socializing, people's inability to differentiate between actual hunger and the desire to eat due to an exogenous factor (boredom, stress, the pursuit of reward, etc.), and the fact that food marketing companies are making a big buck out of getting people hooked onto sugar rich foods. 




 It's the exact same thing. 'Dietary' merely refers to the proteins which are obtained from consumption of food and then broken down into amino acids for a vast array of purposes. But the issue is that most people don't actually know the types of food that contain proteins.  




 I have a major in Human Nutrition and I'm currently majoring in Biochemistry with a minor in Education. I wish someone would have told me about how the average person is completely ignorant of what they're putting through their mouth daily. I'm a substitute high School Biology teacher, and I also work with morbidly obese children, and most of the time the rest of their family is equally obese; most parents don't even know what a dietary protein is...  












































 That's why I keep changing up my routine... Different variations of deadlifts (stiff leg, snatch grip), squats (back, front, box), different angles for the bench and dumbbell press exercises, different forms of cardio (running, alternating sprints and fast walks, elliptical, stairmaster, etc.).  




 No, but I socialize a lot less than I used to do. I've stopped associating myself with people who look unhealthy and have unhealthy life habits.

'Being defeated is often a temporary condition. Giving up is what makes it permanent.' - Marilyn vos Savant, Columnist

'It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, if he wins, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.' -Roosevelt

'No citizen has a right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training...what a disgrace it is for a man to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.' -Socrates

'Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it lasts forever.' -Lance Armstrong

 I don't believe metabolic homeostatis should be maintained for too long. Evolutionary speaking, living beings best grow and/or evolve when they are constantly forced to adapt. Also, it's in our nature as humans to seek continuous self-improvement in the realm of physical capabilities... Many ancient societies believed that the ideal man is the one who is on a perpetual quest to better both his body and mind... that only he who was a warrior, and then a philosopher, can become a leader (for example, with Plato's principle of the Philosopher Kings). And you can't do that by maintaining homeostatic balance, because it's simply not as efficient, regardless of what you're trying to do; in order to attain your goals, whether it be to become more muscular, stronger, faster or more endurant, sacrifices must be made.  




 You don't maintain. You pick up resistance training and start being at a caloric surplus again so as to increase the amount of muscular tissue in your body. Being strong and muscular to a certain extent is almost as important for health and longevity as not being overweight; it improves quality of life, especially in later life, and has protective effects against a plethora of diseases (such as osteoporosis).  














 For weight loss, all that matters is the type of energy balance you end the day with. And the food choices you make only matter insofar as they allow you to end the day with a negative balance.

It's simple:

Caloric surplus = positive energy balance = fat tissue increases.
Caloric maintenance = metabolic homeostatis = fat tissue remains the same.
Caloric deficit = negative energy balance = fat tissue decreases.

This is the only reliable principle when it comes to weight loss. Everything else is either ignorance or a marketing ploy that takes advantage of said ignorance.  




 'Hepatic' simply means that which relates to the liver. The glucose from food is mainly processed in the liver.  




 I can assure that I understand the findings. But I'm somewhat out of touch with what regular people understand. I study Biochemistry and Human Nutrition and work in a faculty lab, and most of my friends work/study either in the same faculty or in related disciplines, such as Pharmacology, Neuroscience, Medicine, Kinesiology, etc. So the people I interact with on a daily basis understand these things very well.  




 Pretty much, unless, like you said, your purpose is to continuously increase muscular tissue, in which case you would also continuously adjust your caloric intake so as to always stay at a positive energy balance despite the increase in lean tissue.  




 It definitely supports the use of a glucose metabolism supplement while bulking, such as one that contains corosolic acid.  




 Definitely, but it simply isn't discussed in this study.  




 Positive energy balance = you end the day with more energy than your body needs = caloric surplus.

Negative energy balance = you end the day with less energy than your body needs = caloric deficit.

Even energy balance = metabolic homeostatis.  




 Oh wow. Thank you. I hadn't seen this mistake. I think my auto-corrector actually did that...  




 I understand your point. I just dislike overly simplified explanations such as the one that asking to 'ELI5' implies, because, even though they enable the uneducated to get a better understanding, they often do at the cost of losing in accuracy. Science is very complex... things can rarely be explained both simply and accurately at the same time, in my opinion. I would rather take more time and give the person a more in depth explanation of the related concepts like I'm doing here.  




 No, unfortunately, I don't, but the person who does will become very rich. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly widespread amongst laypeople due to the rise in obesity and other metabolic diseases. The causes are unknown and the research is ongoing, but it's most likely related to dysfunction of various metabolic processes as a result of long-term malnutrition, like I said, or at least the current research is looking into that.
