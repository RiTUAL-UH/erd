 Oh of course not but Fabian will more than likely still say it 




 If this actually does happen expect stuff like "Christian was my mate, I thought he was staying, there was a lot of broken promises" etc

The usual shite really 




 It's his release clause 




 Yeh we definitely should have spent 32.5 million on someone who will sit on the bench, definitely. Also for people who will comeback with Di Maria he was bought to be a starter not sit on the bench it's just not working out at the minute where as benteke wouldn't displace Rooney 




 Because he was only on loan and still a United player, save that for when he gets a permanent move not when United still own him 




 Cool 




 No shit 




 Same  




 But we literally have nobody like schweinsteiger, we lost vidic, Ferdinand, evra, scholes, giggs (on the pitch) so quickly that we don't really have any leaders, we have Rooney who can drive us on but he isn't a leader in the mould of a Keane, Vidic or schweinsteiger  




 Yeh 




 England. No, they are inconsistent, seemingly don't actually care about the football being played or the fans one iota, easily bullied and just seem like bell ends 




 We aren't going to sign him 




 I only post on mobile, United  




 Now they just have to sign him off us, Real and Arsenal according to the Chilean media 




 AD the Dutch paper 




 I'm assuming she told you to keep your foot raised and keep pressure on it and get out of her house and go to a hospital

Should hopefully see the discolouration now 




 Yeh he has the white strapping but I wasn't talking about that, note the brown bandage underneath that further down the arm
