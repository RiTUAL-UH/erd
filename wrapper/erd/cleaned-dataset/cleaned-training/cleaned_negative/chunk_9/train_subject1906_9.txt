 No paywall here. This is the rest of the article, aside from the actual decision which op linked above.

"Federal agents do not have unlimited power to search laptops and other electronic devices without a warrant at the border, including airports, a federal judge in Washington said.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected prosecutors arguments that a laptop was like any other container that could be searched at the border without a warrant. The border search doctrine had limits when it came to electronic devices, Jackson wrote.

Given the vast storage capacity of even the most basic laptops, and the capacity of computers to retain metadata and even deleted material, one cannot treat an electronic storage device like a handbag simply because you can put things in it and then carry it onto a plane, Jackson said.

Jackson is the latest judge to confront warrantless searches of electronic devices since the U.S. Supreme Courts ruling last year in Riley v. California. In Riley, the justices said police generally must get a warrant before searching a cellphone, acknowledging the vast amount of personal information those devices hold.

Citing Riley, Jackson said she would apply the same approach as the high court and weigh the degree to which defendant Jae Shik Kims privacy was invaded when his computer was searched against the governments national security interests. Kim, a Korean businessman, was traveling home from the United States in December 2012 when a U.S. Department of Homeland Security special agent seized his laptop and sent it away for a forensic examination.

She wrote:
The imaging and search of the entire contents of Kims laptop, aided by specialized forensic software, for a period of unlimited duration and an examination of unlimited scope, for the purpose of gathering evidence in a pre-existing investigation, was supported by so little suspicion of ongoing or imminent criminal activity, and was so invasive of Kims privacy and so disconnected from not only the considerations underlying the breadth of the governments authority to search at the border, but also the border itself, that it was unreasonable.

Jackson tossed out incriminating evidence investigators discovered stored in the laptop, which prosecutors used to charge Kim with violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.  

Kims lawyer, David Deitch of Ifrah Law in Washington, said Jacksons ruling made clear that the government will still have all its rights to protect the border if it is doing searches that are designed to thwart crimes that are afoot at the border crossing.

This is a really interesting and unresolved area of the law right now because, as often happens, were taking 17th century concepts of privacy rights and trying to apply them to 21st century technology, Deitch said.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorneys office in Washington said they were reviewing the ruling.

Jacksons decision was the second in the past year in the D.C. federal trial court to address warrantless searches of laptops at airports.
In December, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras rejected a motion to suppress evidence filed by another defendant charged with sanctions violations, Shantia Hassanshahi. Hassanshahi claimed the government lacked reasonable suspicion to seize and search his computer. He also argued the search was unlawful because investigators discovered his phone number using a secret law enforcement database.

Contreras found there was reasonable suspicion to search Hassanshahis computer. Law enforcement had reason to believe Hassanshahi was doing business in Iran, the judge said, including an earlier federal investigation into his activities involving Iran, his past travels there and the fact that he was carrying multiple electronic devices that appeared to be inconsistent with just personal use while traveling.

Jackson said that Kims case was different from Hassanshahis because there was nothing about Kims particular travel plans that would arouse suspicion; he was returning to his home in Korea and he was known to have business operations within the United States.

The next hearing in Kims case is scheduled for May 18."

 "REUTERS - Israel has reported an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu virus in the north of the country, two months after declaring a series of similar outbreaks earlier this year had been resolved, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said on Tuesday.

High pathogenic H5N1 bird flu first infected humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. It has since spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries, causing millions of poultry infections and several hundred human deaths.

The strain is different to the H5N2 strain that has been spreading in the United States, leading to the death or culling of nearly 30 million birds so far."

 re South Dakota 

"South Dakota was the center of weather extremes Sunday, with a tornado damaging a small town and injuring at least nine people on the eastern side of the state and more than a foot of snow blanketing the Black Hills to the west."

"Farther north, a late-season snow fell in parts of the Rockies, western Nebraska and western South Dakota.

National Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Carstens said between 10 to 18 inches of snow was on the ground Sunday morning in the Black Hills of South Dakota and totals could reach 20-24 inches by the time the system moves out. Rapid City, South Dakota, had 8-11 inches, accompanied by 20-30 mph winds."

 "Tyler Moore and his father said they have been coming to the north end of Carolina Beach for the past 15 years and were shocked to see how much was gone.

"We looked down and were not expecting to see the drop off, because normally the sand over here is just about even with the rocks, Moore said, pointing to the sand along the coastline. Now it's probably dropped off 8-10 feet especially up under the pier so it was really a shock. Then we walked down the beach (towards the north end) and to see how much of the beach was gone was really surprising."

"However, Town Manager Michael Cramer said in the grand scheme of things those damages are minimal. 

"Really our storm damage reduction program is having the benefit that we want it to have and that is stopping any of the wave action from damaging business, damaging personal property, or our infrastructure, Cramer explained. So the fact that we have the dunes, that's working, and this is just a normal process of maintaining and keeping those dunes up so we don't have major damage when we have storms like this."

Kramer said the damage that was done is easily fixable. Officials are looking to add a few steps to some accesses that were hit the hardest by the erosion to make it easier for people to get down to the beach. 

Also, the town has contacted a contractor to re-stack the rocks along the 1500 block of Carolina Beach Road North, past the Carolina Beach Pier. Some of those rocks have been disheveled due to Ana's impact."

 'The volcanic eruption warning on Mount Hakoneyama was raised to Level 2 on May 6, meaning that people should stay clear of the crater on the mountain that straddles Kanagawa and Shizuoka prefectures.

The Japan Meteorological Agency had maintained a Level 1 alert although earthquakes around the mountain intensified in frequency and strength over the past 10 days. This is the first Level 2 alert for the mountain since the system was introduced in March 2009....'

From RSOE "An eruption warning has been declared for the volcano, as increased seismic activity under the wakudani hydrothermal field were registered during the past days and could herald sudden phreatic explosions. The Owakudani valley lies north of the central lava domes inside the Hakone caldera. Seismicity started to increase in late April, consisting mostly of swarms of shallow quakes at 2 and 5 km depth. More intense swarms have occurred during the past days, triggering the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to raise the alert level of the volcano to 2. Simultaneously, slight deformation of the ground was detected and it appears that fumarolic activity has increased in the past days. Japanese authorities have closed access to the area, which is a popular tourist destination. After the deadly, sudden phreatic eruption of Ontake-san volcano last year, the risk of such eruptions has been taken very seriously. Whether or not an eruption will occur at Hakone in the near future is impossible to say. Similar seismic crises have occurred in the past with no eruption following. The last known eruption at Hakone occurred in 950 AD."

 MANILA, Philippines (AP)  A Philippine volcano has spewed ash for the second time in less than a week but there were no signs of any imminent violent eruption, the country's chief volcano expert said Thursday.

Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon province southeast of Manila ejected ash 250 meters (825 feet) above the 1,565-meter (5,165-foot) volcano late Wednesday, said Renato Solidum, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

The agency asked local officials to keep people away from a 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) hazardous zone around the crater, he said. He said aircraft should not fly close to the mountain to avoid any sudden explosions and ash clouds.

Solidum said the explosion was due to ground water coming into contact with hot rocks and not rising magma. He says such "phreatic" explosions are typical of Bulusan. The ash explosion lasted about 3-1/2 minutes, shorter than the 5-minute explosion recorded May 1.

A large explosion in February 2011 that shot an ash plume about 2 kilometers (more than a mile) into the sky prompted about 1,200 villagers to flee to shelters.

Bulusan is one 23 volcanoes considered active by the volcanology agency, but it has not had a violent eruption since in 1918.

The country is in the Pacific "Ring of Fire," where volcanic activity and earthquakes are common. In June 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the northern Philippines exploded in one of the biggest eruptions in the 20th century. 









 GLENDALE, Ore. -- Fire crews worked through the night after a large fire broke out north of Glendale Tuesday night at Peavine Creek.

Firefighters are currently trying to contain the fire, working since 5 p.m. Tuesday after fire detection cameras spotted the blaze.

Douglas Forest Protective Association says its estimated that 123 acres have already been burned.

According to DFPA there is a fire trail around half of the blaze.

"As we're going along with the fire trail, we're pummeling it with water too so we can work on those hotspots, said DFPAs Kyle Reed. There's going to be a lot of work to go before this fire's contained but there's a lot of good work that's being done out here too."
     
Reed says there will be a 100 percent mop-up before they are done with this fire.

"With it being so early in the fire season, we have to make sure this fire's going to be good not only for a couple days from now or a couple weeks from now, but 2-to-3 months from now when we're in the peak of fire season."

Douglas County is in its third year of drought conditions. Reed says it's important to be careful when burning your debris or even mowing your lawn.

"Stuff that doesn't typically cause fires this time of the year -- we're going to see an increase in stuff like that, so people just need to be cautious when theyre working or recreating in wildlife areas."

The cause of the Peavine Creek fire is still under investigation.

 GAITHERSBURG, Md. (WJLA) -- A 28-year-old Missouri woman has been charged with sexually abusing a 15-year-old Gaithersburg boy.

Police say Garen Smith met the alleged victim while playing Xbox online. Investigators say she drove all the way from Missouri to connect with the boy.

According to charging documents, the boys mother invited the woman to move into the family's Gaithersburg home.

Smith and the boy shared a room and would push their mattresses together at night, according to records.

On her Facebook page, Smith says she is working on an R.N. degree, but she loves her video games.

Investigators say the alleged victim told them he and Smith had numerous sexual encounters. He said that she frequently said she was afraid of going to jail if anyone found out about what they were doing.

Apparently the mother became suspicious and communicated with police.


(you did see the part that said "the boys mother invited the woman to move into the family's Gaithersburg home.", right?)

People living near the Three Mile Island nuclear plant may have heard a loud release of steam at 1 a.m. Wednesday as the plant was shut down after an electrical issue developed in the reactor.
The plant was taken out of service after a problem developed with an electrical component that operates one of the control rods in the reactor.

The control rods control the nuclear reaction in the reactor.
The issue with the control rod presented no danger or issue with controlling the reactor, said Exelon spokesman Ralph DeSantis.
He said the release of steam when the plant was being taken off-line was audible to nearby residents. Any radioactivity in the steam was too low to detect so there was no threat to the public or the environment, DeSantis said.

I suppose it's good they did this in November 2014, just in case   all:

 oh go drown or something.. 




 I can not agree with you on that. We all need water. Let those with little funds die of thirst?  

So many people struggle just to make ends meet, to maintain a roof   a bit of food on the table. Would you have us collect rainwater in every available bucket, resulting in the alarming rise of mosquito borne illness which we are currently seeing running amok in places like Columbia?   http://outbreaknewstoday.com/dengue-cases-top-40000-in-malaysia-colombia-sees-10000-additional-chikungunya-cases-14946/

No. This is not the future I wish for my or anyone else's children.

Privatization of water must not be allowed to happen. Water belongs as a public sector element, and we need those government agencies that manage our current environmental troubles to step up and start doing the jobs they were elected to   for which they are paid.

Selling off water rights to private industry will result in nothing less than a disaster; the type that will make our citizenry rise up in a manner no one wants to ever have to see on a large scale.

 Read the news, a lot. 

Figure out which issues are important to you personally. Business   economy? Civil   human rights? Health   welfare? Environment? Military   defense? Science   technology?

Once you have a sense of where you lean on some of the various issues, start looking into where those running for elected office stand.

Educate yourself as best able on things that are important to you, make sure you register to vote, and use that privilege to get those that most agree with your viewpoints elected.

I also want to add that reading one article from one source on one politician is not enough. Read a lot of opinions/article from a variety of sources, and always consider the source when reading what they are saying.
