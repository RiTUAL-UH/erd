 I'm in enthusiastic agreement with you 




 OP, THANK YOU for clearly and explicitly crediting the artist in the title of your post and linking to their site. Artists everywhere rejoiced. 




 At Wake Forest University, if you're interested! 




 [J.K. Rowling has written new material about the Time Turner on Pottermore](http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner) and specifically states that "the longest period that may be relived without the possibility of serious harm to the traveller or to time itself is around **five hours.**" 




 You can even get a lot of books through the library as long as you're proactive about renewing and don't care to keep it at the end of the course. Check your university's library's consortium or get it through Inter Library Loan (ILL) if yours doesn't have it available. 




 I was really hoping that your story was going to end with that royal jackass getting fired for sexual harassment, or something...but now I'm just sad.  :( 




 "my fiancee" /Mississippiaccent

I was a little sad to actually get married because I really enjoyed calling my now husband that.  




 It does put me in a awkward position vis a vis my progeny! 




 This is a tip for ways of acting **before** you even get to the wedding. 

Do. Not. Ask. To. Be. Invited.

Just, don't. Making a guest list is one of the most gut-wrenching and difficult processes in planning a wedding. Weddings are expensive as balls and *most* couples simply cannot afford to have everyone there that they would like. It gets even more complex when there are family pressures - which can be more difficult the larger the family or if you're dealing with divorced parents. (Not always, just sometimes :)) So, don't assume anything, and don't ask the couple. If you receive an invitation you should feel pleasantly surprised and honored to be invited. 

When I was getting married people asked me if they were getting invited after having met them that day. Or old friends of my brothers. Most of these people I genuinely liked, but when you account for the fact that we had to accommodate our two large families and our best/closest/oldest friends...we just didn't have the money or space. 




 Yeah, I remember seeing this on /r/funny a while back and it just made me sad. At a wedding the golden rule is: "It's not about you, asshole." And this is a great example of this. 

Also, most brides pay extra to have a tossing bouquet as they keep the one they used in the wedding (e.g. drying the flowers, etc.). So congrats dude, you should give them $40 bucks.  




 THIS. My husband has a very large family and it was important to both of us to have all of our families there. Because of the size, however, we only extended a "guest" invitation if the couple was engaged, no boyfriend/girlfriends unless the other would already been invited regardless. 

One cousin called to try and convince us otherwise. We explained the situation and offered to take him and his girlfriend out to dinner when we got back to town since we live in the same city. He called another two times in an effort to change our minds. He ended up just bringing her anyway. 

I honestly have no idea where they sat her or how it got paid for, but the real problem was that now all other 40+ cousins who had politely respected the invitation were now wondering why this jackhat got to bring his gf. 

For the record, they split up two weeks later. And that cousin had barely spoken to either of us before or since.  




 This reminds me of when we read Athol Fugard's play "Master Harold...and the boys" in high school. To summarise, it is about race and class relations in apartheid era South Africa. My teacher lost his shit because everyone kept calling them African-Americans. An abiding memory is him nearly yelling, "they are ALL just AFRICAN." 




 Thank you for sharing your experience, I'm sorry for your loss. I suppose this is all the evidence to see that it takes all types. I had a very different reaction to when others responded with their own stories.  




 This can be good, but sometimes it still serves as a 'one-upping' experience. It's best when you actually reference or relate to the original story. Even if it's a similar experience, unless you engage the stories, it can feel very much like you're ignoring the person. Even just acknowledging the story can work wonders, too often people are just too eager to throw in their own story that they won't even let you finish!

Also, when it comes to tragedy, DO NOT RESPOND WITH YOUR OWN GODDAMN STORY. Unless it has happened concurrently, this isn't about you. By doing so, it immediately makes the conversation about you, and makes the person's grief feel trivial. Just don't. 




 When my brother was very young he said he wanted to be a dog. When informed that wasn't possible he change his answer to cat. Explaining in more detail that he couldn't change his species, he then went with "bad guy." 




 Ask her best friend to find out. She could ask in moderately normal conversation or hey could go shopping and just try rings on for fun; even some place with costume jewellery. Just have her take note of the size, even if it's a relative size to her. For example friend knows she wears X size ring, future fiance is close but a little bigger.

But when in doubt, go larger, it's usually easier to size down and a lot less costly since you're not adding more metal. And you won't have pictures like this, that asshats on the internet feel the need to laugh at.  




 Aaaand probably in '94....maybe even '70...

I mean, let us not forget that Brazil has more World Cup championships than any other team 




 The best. My husband and I went there the first night we met. Seals of approval all around. 




 When he passed away in 2011 me and a few friend had a Redwall Feast where we made food described in the books (e.g. Hotroot Soup) and drank a whole lot of lambics. I think it was a fitting memorial and one that I think he would have appreciated.  




 I see myself drafting an Astral Slide early and then picking a whole bunch of other cycling cards and going 0-3. I also see myself splashing a Vampiric Tutor to try and make it better. Slide forever! 




 You can also draw the game if there are no other valid targets for the Animate Dead. The loop must continue. I have no idea why you'd do this in VMA sealed. It used to be a potent trick back in Extended. You could cast Dark Ritual, Entomb, Animate Dead and loop the game to draw it. In vintage, I have entered the mythical land of Game Four a few times. A friend of mine who judged in the Extended Entomb era said that the most draws he ever saw were on a matchslip with the following record: 2-0-21.  




 Is cute supposed to be bad?

It's more about nostalgia than broooooken draft combos you can easily assemble. But for the record, thirteen of the combinations involve only one rare or mythic (setting aside Stroke in the first example.) If someone didn't play fifteen years ago, they might not know that High Tide + Turnabout makes mana. There's even other, smaller historical ones like Frantic Search + Thawing Glaciers, which old Time Spiral decks played. For that matter, they might not know that Gush with Psychatog turns 1.5 damage into 6.5 damage.

Which reminds me that if you played at one point, you know the significance of this algebra equation: 1.5x + 0.5y + 1 :)

 




 It's won me many a game : ) 









 There's a 111% guarantee, so if you sign up and don't like it, QS will pay you back more than you paid for the 1-month sub. No way to lose : ) 




 You can sharpen them - it fits the NYX sharpener best (SHOCKING, I KNOW).  




 I have found with the stats in general that they won't update until you log in next time. So if you were checking immediately after playing, they aren't showing your current session's stats 




 I had one of these before and about half way through it stopped advancing product into the sponge. They used to have translucent tubes where you could actually see the product. I ended up throwing it away because I didn't really love the product...but I thought this was going to give me an answer! WHOMP WHOMP.  




 Geeze, it sounds like you've tried almost everything - I don't envy you. You've probably already tried it, but my last suggestion would be to make sure you apply the concealer very thinly and gradually and build it up in thin layers. Then I would apply a quality powder on top with a beauty blender (or dupe - I use the [Cheeky blender](http://www.amazon.com/Flawless-Foundation-Sponges-Blenders-Cheeky%C2%AE/dp/B00BMLOJK8/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8 qid=1393001753 sr=8-6 keywords=beauty+blender+4+pack) and it works beautifully). By doing the bouncy application with the blender, you get a very smooth finish but a very light application. Godspeed sister. 




 That's rough. :( Have you ever used a peel? I use the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Hydroxy Peel Pads - my husband and I call them "Black Magic Face Pads" though. They completely revolutionized my skin when I started using them. It's kind of the nuclear option in terms of peels, but if you really have issues with texture, etc. it can be worth it. I used them daily for a full cycle and they have broken my skin out of its dehydrated/dry state to where I can now get away with using them less frequently. They are expensive, but I was able to get some samples at Nordstrom and Sephora before pulling the trigger. You could also try with other peels too. Lactic acid will be gentler, and there are a lot of other options.

I would really recommend checking something out as I find the peel can really transform your skin's texture and quality which moisturizers and oils can help further improve and maintain.  




 Before makeup I use a personal blend of oils designed to moisturize and calm my skin's redness (apricot kernel, sweet almond, meadowfoam, borage, and sunflower seed). I follow that with CeraVe moisturizing cream (the one in the tub). Its fairly rich but absorbs nicely and plays well with makeup. For both of these I give them a few minutes to sink in. I don't actually use a primer at all. I've done A-B testing on a bunch and not seen a big difference for my makeup is staying power.

At night I use a real basic cleanser with Clairsonic, remove my eye makeup with up   up remover, and then every other day or every third day I use Dr. Dennis Gross alpha beta hydroxy peel pads (60 day). Then I follow with the oil and CeraVe.

This is probably way more info than you bargained for, but I'm pretty passionate about skincare. I have naturally very dry skin and it has taken me quite awhile to get my skin to where it is (I'm 28, fyi). I hope this helps, pm me if you want to chat more about it!
