 I'll drink to that! 




 Just thought I'd add my experience from the day. I had to get a 6am train and when I was waiting for the train 200 miles away I checked Twitter and there were already people queueing outside. After he finished it was like something out of an apocalypse, everyone flooding out of that stadium!  




 It was **epic** I had goose bumps throughout. They were just wearing off then Dre came and I nearly fell over with excitement. 

Yeah that is a shame. I was pretty close to the front but it would be cool to see all the angles.  














 I only watched the video because I was hoping for a big thunderous fart.
