 Is that engine water coming out of that hole on the side?

 Destin's facebook comment 

This article by Slate that explores the Facebook Freebooting problem. They asked me for quotes. I tried to be fair. They quoted me a bit strong, which makes me feel a tad strange.... Like Wyatt Earp trying to clean up the bad guys or something. I'm not Wyatt Earp. I'm just a dude learning stuff on the Internet.
Also, it's kind of funny that I'm sharing this via Facebook. 









 You have to remember that there are more candidates in the republican field though so you would expect them to all have a smaller slice of the pie than Hillary who's only real competition at the moment is Bernie. 




 I don't really understand what your comment says. 




 Thats really cool, I have heard that it will take a while to get all the pictures back, there is going to be so much data to download. 




 Thats what I was going to say there is quite the monetary incentive to get married. 




 This sounds like about the same amount of extreme conservatives so I would not call it that significant.  Texas is constantly talking about succeeding yet they still have not done it.  

This statistic would be much more significant if all these people were in a just a few states.  This would mean that those states would have more than half of the population supporting succession. 




 They got back together again in may after having been married and divorced twice. 




 I just read the Wikipedia it looks like every time they divorce she gets a few million dollars, and then they get back together again lol.  Not a bad deal.  

I can't believe they are back together again after getting married and then divorced twice. 




 Can you repost this to /r/New_Horizons?  This is really cool. 




 Wow can you repost this to /r/New_Horizons?  This is really cool 




 Wow that is crazy.  I personally believe that Commercialism can only last so long in a world like this, eventually, a new structure will have to come about.  People will not put up with it otherwise. 




 I somehow did a hard reset on my nook a few weeks ago, It was not a big deal as with most of my books I have the .epub's on my computer. But when i turned it on it would not work unless I typed in my B N login.

How do I keep this from happening in the future?

Is there open source software for the Nook that I could install?

I don't want to get trapped in this situation again. This time i was able to recover my password from B N.com, but in the future i have a feeling B N might not be there.

 That might work, if the GOP was more against what he was saying,  but so far the base is loving him, and the candidates are not calling him out at all.  In fact Ted Cruz even voiced support for his comment about Mexican rapists.  So far it looks like this is going more the way of Tod Akin and the "Women have a way to shut that down".  People are seeing Trump as emblematic of Republicans, not the crazy outlier. 




 Except they were on the airplane by that point. 




 What a difference 4 days makes.  So glad we are getting more pictures.

 No they run a very efficient propaganda campaign online where they basically convince young people that they can come make a difference in the world by joining ISIS. That they can make the world a better place where the ideals of islam are followed crap like that.  They sell themselves as the the oppressed that are defending the true ideals of Islam.  

This is why you hear about so many of these kids that go to Syria and join ISIS and then a couple months later they want to come home.  Basically they were brainwashed by ISIS into thinking that ISIS was a good cause, and when they get there they start to see that the stuff they are doing is pretty horrible.

PS: Sorry if you were being sarcastic. 




 I would argue it is more important to cut off their supply of new recruits.  There needs to be a information war to counter the propaganda ISIS puts out convincing young people to come join. 









 Is there any legitimate reason for this? 




 Is there any legitimate reason to restrict flight over water?

 I think it could go either way I cant wait for polling data to see which way it is. 




 I think that article perfectly illustrates how outside the Fox bubble Trump looks like a nut with no possible way to win a general election, But inside the Fox News bubble he seems like a Bernie Sanders for Republicans the next Reagan.  

I also found it funny how the author compared trump to White supremacist governors and such saying how much more effective he is than they were.  Why would you want to make that comparison for a candidate you support? 




 Yea many people expect women to have to go sit on a toilet while they feeding their baby.  And if you are in a park or something and there isn't one, too bad I guess the baby needs to go hungry because seeing a boob is too traumatic. 




 All the people that think that women should not be able to breastfeed in public.  Women get heckled for simply feeding there baby in a public location. 




 I sure hope so. 




 Yea but you have to look at why people are breaking the law.  By coming to the US they can make 10 times as much doing the exact same job.  

You also have to question why we are so resistant to immigration from Latin America.  We seem to have no problem with people coming from Europe, but when they come from Mexico suddenly they are a danger to our country and leaching off our taxes and welfare.  

In reality immigrants like those from Latin America pay an enormous amount of taxes even if they are illegal, because they spend almost 100% of what they earn. 

When looking at this issue you should consider that Illegal immigrants would not be coming to the US if there were not job opportunities here.  The companies are breaking the law by hiring illegal immigrants.  If people wanted to truly stop illiegal immigration they would target these companies not the people that are just taking advantage of the opportunities available to them. 









 That would be great.  Or puts some wheels on it and fly it places just to see peoples faces.

 IDK Why but i hated that episode.  I have since rewatched it and it was not as bad but it still just felt embarrassing. 




 Out of the 8 planes i have been checked out on, only one had an autopilot.  It was a heading hold autopilot.  It did not work very well basically it would fight you to try and maintain the heading on the heading bug.  So if you were to accidentally bump the button, it would put you in a sudden turn and when you tried to correct you it would feel like somebody was in the other seat working against you.  My instructor showed me where it was just in case and suggested i not use it.  

The point is there are not as many autopilot planes as you think, and even if you are i one and know how to use it.  That does not fix the spacial disorientation problem.  When you enter IMC and program in the turn, it is likely it will feel like the autopilot is doing the wrong thing the feeling is likely to be so compelling that you may switch off the autopilot thinking that it is broken. 




 Yea I wonder what his problem was. 




 I believe that is an optional add on.

 Ground school can be good if thats the way you learn.  I would suggest waiting on ground school though, you don't need ground school to start flight lessons.  I would suggest buying a textbook and reading it.  It will teach you a lot of the stuff that you need to know about flying.  After that decide if you still feel like you need ground school. 

For a good textbook I would suggest the "[Jeppesen Private Pilot Manual](http://www.mypilotstore.com/MyPilotStore/sep/1941?gclid=CjwKEAjwq-OsBRDd95aryprR9wQSJACQnU3G0_g1hIS09r0XCLhoNmeKJErvy2EXaHVnNM0Qcpui-RoCzfbw_wcB)".  That is the one I used and I really liked it. There were lots of diagrams and pictures, and it was easy to understand.

As for the Wings of Carolina Flying Club, I have not found rates any better anywhere else I have looked.  I probably would have joined by now, but I don't fly enough for the $65 monthly membership rate to be cost effective.  But it is totally worth it to take lessons there.  Their instructor rates are half of anywhere else I have seen, and because you tend to fly more while taking lessons it would come out cheaper.

 Yea i agree, imagine if it happened while it was going by that would suck so bad. 









 I did flyover Fayetteville and Fort Bragg one time but i am not very familiar with flying opportunities down there.  The closest club I know about is [Wings of Carolina Flying Club](http://wingsofcarolina.org/) They have [really good rates](http://wingsofcarolina.org/aircraft) on their airplanes and their instructors, but that is pretty far north for you.  You need to do the math and see if it is worth it to make the trip.

Just form some simple googling I was able to find a couple flight schools in Fayetteville. 

* http://www.dillonsaviation.com/
* http://aaavn.com/pricing/

Those are just a couple, there are a ton more.  

Just google, and also look for local airports around you almost every airport including the tiny ones have a flying school.  A lot of times it is good just to go to the airport FBO and ask about flying schools.  Shop around if you feel like you are getting a bad deal, go to a different place, it is also important that you feel comfortable with your instructor. 

Also as for flying as a hobby, that is fine, but it is a very expensive hobby.  You just need to make sure you can keep up with the costs.  If you want to go flying once a month for 2 hours you could easily be spending $200 or more.

   Expect to spend 8000 or more on training to get your Private.  If you can afford it, training faster(2,3 or more lessons a week) is cheaper in the long run because you waste less time reviewing.  Once you have your Private things get a little cheaper as well, because you don't need to pay for an instructor and so on.

I hope this all helped.

My best suggestion is to shop around take lots of notes on prices and figure out what is best for you.  




 Cool 




 You should go to a flight school and talk to a flight instructor.  A lot of these questions are super simple to answer.

As for your questions 

1.  You are charged for when the engine is running not how much time the plane is in your possession.  So if you fly for 2 hours spend the night and fly 2 hours back you will pay for a total of 4 hours.  Depending on where you rent from, it is common to have minimum daily hours if you are going to have the plane for more than a day.  So the minimum daily hours might be 4 hours meaning for every day you have the plane you get charged for 4 hours whether you flew 4 hours or not.  

2. This is basic stuff you learn in your first few lessons.  basically when flying into most uncontrolled airports there is nothing you need to do ahead of time.  Most airports are uncontrolled meaning there is no control tower telling you which way to go.  you report over the radio where you are in relation to the airport and talk to other planes in the pattern in order to maintain safe spacing and so on.

3. A typical renting situation is renting an airplane for a wet hourly rate meaning fuel is included.  For a 4 seater Cessna 172. this can range for anything from $110 an hour to $165 an hour.  This is why it is important to shop around and find the best prices.  This will be your main cost.  If you plan to spend the night at a different airport then it is typical to pay small tie down fee(Most people don't put their plane in a hangar for an overnight stay), all though it is common for this to be waived if you buy fuel (which is paid for by your hourly rate anyway).  The only place you really see landing fees are at big airports like Charlotte or Raleigh most private pilots don't usually go into these airports though unless they are based there.

I also fly in NC if you want, you can PM me or comment a more specific location and I might be able to suggest some flight schools.

 they are mostly protesting the clack of communication that the Admins are giving them.  The mods of the big subreddits are basically donating their time and they have been feeling especially lately that the admins have been treating them like crap. 




 Wait Echo you run SpaceXStats? 




 I don't understand, what is the big deal about this? 




 Yea maybe, unless the content gets significantly worse though, I am kind of invested in reddit and would like to try and stick it out.  Pao wont be around forever.  It is quite possible the new CEO will be better at communicating. 




 where did you get that quote from?  and what kind of comercial stuff? 




 Everyone calm down there is no way that reddit is on par with digg. 




 Possibly, but it would take time and as many have pointed out, without a viable alternative atm most people will just stick around in the short term. 




 I don't think this is the end Reddit has drama thats what the Users like.  The mods are putting their foot down about this, and my guess is it will be resolved, either the way everyone hopes, by bringing Victoria back, or the Reddit mods de-modding the mods of the defaults and forcefully making them public again. 









 Wow I just went and looked at that it looks like a complete knockoff of Reddit.  everything looks almost exactly the same but is slightly different.

 Can you post this over at /r/New_horizons?  It is really cool 




 The funny thing is Latinos tend to be very socially conservative, but the Republicans just keep shooting themselves in the foot with things like self deportation, and now Donald Trump.   

Notice that more than one Republican frontrunner is there to court Latinos.  Jeb Bush's wife is Mexican, and he speaks Spanish fluently.  Marco Rubio is latino and also speaks Spanish.   Notice that the republicans have also been trying to mov away from their previous stance on immigration.  They are trying to court the Latino voting block without loosing their base.  I feel like that is why they like Jeb so much.  With him they can have it both ways.  He is a standard white conservative that the Republican base will vote for, but he also is very appealing to the Latino population because he is so in tune with them and their culture. 




 I think worrying is good, it keeps you from getting overconfident.

 There are multiple reasons why this wouldn't work, that have been addressed in other threads.

1. The first is the legs, they are not strong enough to support the whole rocket.  Just having an empty second stage, and Dragon on top would add a significant amount of weight to the craft.  

2. You would not be able to get fuel out of stage 2 further exacerbating problem 1 as well as problem 3 and 4.

3. Now we get into control problems.  When flying through the atmosphere on a rocket, you want the heavy end going first, followed by the light end for stability purposes (this is not that un-similar from a dart or arrow.).  When the rocket launches the top is the heavy end.  When the first stage is flying in for landing the bottom where the engines are is the heavy end.  By keeping the top on the rocket you mess all this up, now the top is heavy, but you are flying engines first.  This setup is unstable, and most likely will lead to the aerodynamic forces flipping the rocket around.  
4.  Similar to the first problem the grid-fins, which are normally located all the way at the top of the first stage would now be a third of the way down the rocket rendering them ineffective.  What makes the grid-fins so effective, is the long arm to the center of gravity(basically they are about as far away from the center of gravity as possible, like the tail on an arrow.).  Having the top on the rocket puts the grid-fins very close to the Center of mass rendering them useless.  This would make targeting anything as small as a landing platform impossible.


In perfect conditions, and with some retrofitting, like strengthening the legs, moving the grid-fins to the dragon trunk and adding a way to vent/transfer fuel to stage 1 from stage 2, you might be able to do it.  but now what you have done is designed a new rocket that is capable of this RTLS abort.  This seems like it may be reasonable until you think about how many circumstances this may actually be used. There are virtually none, because if Falcon is functioning well enough to do this maneuver, it is probably capable of getting to orbit.  This maneuver is much harder than just getting to orbit.  

So if things were going south and you want to cut your losses, aborting the Dragon capsule, bringing the 1st stage in for landing, and just accepting the loss of the second stage, seems much more reasonable and has a much better chance of working than attempting a full stack landing. 




 It does look similar, in Interstellar he even had [orange lines and stuff](http://aroundmovies.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Interstellar_2014_0511.jpg) on his suit. 

You should totally watch Gravity and Interstellar, and read "The Martian"  They are great. 




 It is completely unrelated.  The movie is an adaptation of the book ["The Martian"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_\(Weir_novel\)) by Andy Weir.  You should read the book it is awesome.  

Gravity, Interstellar, and The Martian are completely different stories in different universes.  Hollywood is on a bit of a space theme lately though which I love. 




 Yea most people don't feel like doing anything when they are down much less writing a log about nothing. 




 Really?  I was completely oblivious until he attacked Matthew Mcconaughey, I don't know why I did not see it coming.  My belief was totally suspended. 




 I refused to watch the trailer for interstellar before seeing the movie because I did not want to ruin it.  I am approaching a lot of movies that way these days.  But a lot of times it is a real test of will. 




 That actually was likely the beginnings of the heart attack.  When women get heart attacks it is common for them to get upper back and shoulder pain, not just the typical "chest pain". 




 Did anyone else notice the little guy on her hip? 




 I think people are excited about SpaceX and because of that they are reluctant to be critical.  I am really happy so much is favorable as well. 




 You might want to try lemon RX if you need a cheap receiver i have been using them, and haven't had any troubles yet. 




 Basically anything where the rocket is still flying but has left its planned course.  Great examples of times when self destruct would probably be employed is the 

* [Proton mishap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjNNX2sLIro)
* [Early launches of China's Long March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBJ9ue6GKek) - This one actually killed hundreds of people in a nearby town.


In both of these self destruct was not employed, and you can see how much damage and how dangerous the rocket is capable of.

 Where's the top? 




 I have begun to post new pictures when they come out, because being so close to the encounter means detail is now starting to become apparent.  In a few more days there should be a noticeable difference between the todays picture and the day before.  

Even if you compare this picture to the one just a couple days ago you will notice that pluto has gotten noticeably bigger in size. 




 thats good, but if it is going to be practical for flight training (landings and takeoffs and maneuvers practice) it really needs to be 2 or more hours. 




 MEXICO still the best.

 If you watch the video It seems like the sentiment is it is amazing that SpaceX has had such a good run.  They don't seem to blaming SpaceX for this failure they seems to be saying that SpaceX has been doing an excellent job, and this was bound to happen eventually.
