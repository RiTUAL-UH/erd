 I rarely drop a book but I recently did that with Roth's American Pastoral. I've read his stuff before but Pastoral was just too.... much. 




 There's a lot of books I feel that way about too. I think this is especially true of most classics.

Yeah, don't worry about being a little off my question. I'm not one of those hardcore redditors who scream when someone strays from the question or topic's content. 




 To say nothing of the fact that Oklahoma wasn't in the Confederacy. So they can't claim the lame "heritage" stance. 




 Just finished reading The Goldfinch. I couldn't stand it when it started out (this line sent me over the edge, "someone could have mistaken her for being Icelandic").

However as I got into it, it turned out to be a really good book.

What was your favorite turnaround?
