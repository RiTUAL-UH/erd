 I just started working for a multi-billion dollar company in beauty and cosmetics. The company is 85% women, I am 100% man.

Today, in a monthly update the VP meeting, I joked, "it's strange to me that a multi-billion dollar beauty and cosmetics company provides employees with single-ply toilet paper."

I think it's fair to say my days are numbered.

 









 Oh yeah! Lot's of Hollywood contracts have that. When TV is on the moon, yo. 




 I'm American and was working in Germany recently. I had a contract that said I couldn't be a Scientologist.

 They're Pinky and the Brain / I'm singin' in the rain                                           
They're Pinky and the Brain / Just singin' in the rain                                          
One is a genius / What a glorious feeling                                                          
The other's insane / I'm happy again                                                                
They're laboratory mice / I walk down the lane                                                  
Their genes have been spliced / With a happy refrain                                           
They're dinky / I'm singin'                                                                                       
They're Pinky and the Brain / I'm singin' in the rain                                               









 Thanks, bubby! 









 Nothing worse than a premature punchline 




 just lemme know if you can't come 




 I know! I think it was just a drop off center built into a pharmacy or something. But the awning was huge.  




 I gave everyone a stick of gum and left for the post office 




 Returned to sender! 




 I'm patient and stupid = happy!
