 Indeed - this house is very unassuming from the outside and looks like nothing at all.

It was a pleasant experience 




 Fixed :)

 Like I said - send me a message here https://www.facebook.com/train_subject246

Lets talk, I don't mind sharing - but not if I don't know shit about you!!

I'm not the only explorer who upholds this value. 




 Send me a Facebook message or website message. Lets talk 




 I will never, nor would any other smart explorer, give a location like this out to a random person on a site like Reddit. 




 ...hence why these are still amazing places.

Give these locations to someone on Reddit I have never spoken to before? Your definition of snob is inaccurate

 i'm told the prior owner collected them and there used to be many more.  The rest of the house had a real dark/gothic vibe to it 



















 You can see them both (in low res) on my Facebook linked in comments above  




 Renovations...in my pic without the overlay you can see that they bricked over the window on the right.  You can see it at www.Facebook.com/freaktography  




 Go to www.Facebook.com/freaktography i posted it in the comments below this pic. 




 This is, by name an insane asylum. I agree though...the term us often overused likely to attract views etc  




 Animals, rodents and people kicking them around.  Also, with time and weather the corners curl up and they come loose. 




 hahaha - you just did!! 




 awesome!!!!! 




 It was done by whomever posted that B W image online 














 I couldn't agree more!!! 














 Nothing - but it looks like it might be creepy! 




 lol 




 hahaha I know!  But it LOOKS mysterious! 














 There are, it's shocking!

 Those are the names of the doctors..not the patient. And these are published reports

 Haha you win!! 




 If by smoke  you mean gas....then yes.  Ha  




 407 upvotes and 30+ comments and NOW you remove my submission? 




 I upvoted you - because I upset you and an upvote is the Reddit Hug! 




 If I were one to take things I'd either have a fully stocked ebay account, a very successful antique store, a cool as hell basement or a nice bank account balance.

But it's not my thing to take things from these places - as tempting as it can be at times!!!!

I have been to a place months or years after a first visit to find a great deal of the items gone.  So the treasure hunters are out there, and as long as I can help it, they won't be getting any addresses from this guy!!! 









 lol 




 lol me too!!!
 




 I will when I am able to get back 




 I'm gonna try and get back this weekend - I am a jackass and didn't shoot the actual cards!!!!

Stay Tuned!

 Can I edit the original submission or do I have to resubmit with (OC)? 









 Wow - Thanks everyone for all the great comments and feedback!

I will see about getting my shots up of the cards, minus any personal information that they contain.

Thanks again.
