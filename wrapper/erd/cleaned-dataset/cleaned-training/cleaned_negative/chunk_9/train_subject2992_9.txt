 Man, I want to use these space stations but I can't handle 850 parts. Normally I'd weld these to something like three parts, however there are too many modules on this.  




 Was taking a look at that picture again, I'm pretty sure you're right. There is a small chance it could be Daario Naharis though. 




 [Interesting shot](http://i.imgur.com/D5BL3sf.jpg) shows Jorah in the fighting pit/arena [where Dany is later on.](http://i.imgur.com/bnmuiox.jpg) Take note of the Targaryen flag in the background in both photos.
