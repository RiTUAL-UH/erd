 Beautiful ridgeback! Ever since I got my lil dude (German shepherd/ridgeback mix) I see them all on here. He also is not a fan of getting a bath. She looks sweet!  




 Hopefully wind picks back up and blows this over so they can get to work  




 J Spieth 




 yes it gets old, i mean it completely as a joke. I also only think it makes sense since she insults the worker for not having all her teeth and in all honesty Britt does have a perrrty mouth, don't she? 




 I wonder how many dicks she sucked to get where she is...

 Mavs in 5. Parsons series MVP. 




 I did nazi that coming  




 Ayyy. 




 he or she looks incredibly awesome! 
























 If we don't sign any free agent Rb, I think we should wait in the draft and pick Desmond Roland then get rid of Joseph Randle. Even though Randle is great on the field, can't risk all his off the field shenanigans. 




 Signing Hardy would be huge. hotty toddy. 














 it's just a retro bottle haha
