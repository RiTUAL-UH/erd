 How small do blades have to be?

Also, nice cat.  




 That's really awesome. 




 I hear you 100%. I feel like dwelling on the past has been my #1 problem in life. I've found it helpful to just keep myself super busy at present on things that will help me in the future. Working hard at work to get promoted, working out at the gym, taking some night classes. All these things keep me too busy to worry about regrets or past experiences and help build a solid foundation for me to be better off in the future.  




 I think a Sailor stationed at Gitmo just did an AMA yesterday. Might want to ask him:

 Ha, it's so funny you mention that. I was searching on Google and Amazon all last week trying to find a decent Loons hat with no success.  




 Do you guys actually brush your teeth with the soap? How does it taste?  




 I can't order "pop" anywhere on the East Coast...however they do have something called "soda" which tastes pretty similar.  




 But what do you want with the detonators, Hans? I already used all the explosives... Or did I? 




 They've been using cats as [firebombs](http://news.discovery.com/history/rocket-cat-warfare-found-in-16th-century-manual-140306) since the 1500s.  




 So he doesn't get incepted.  




 Totally agree. Diet soda has help me shed a ton of calories from regular soda and beer that I would otherwise be drinking. But I still have friends saying "OMG you're going to eat tons more food because of it!" like it's some Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde potion that will force me to eat.  




 Needs more bubblegum 




 Man I know this feeling. Today I had an entire Saturday, and used the whole day to do chores, house repairs, and a report for work...not a single game played :( 




 Guy looks like Junpei 




 Wow nice! Thanks for posting!  




 What a boss 




 My buddy had a PS1 and bought MGS right when it came out. So after school we'd go over to his house to watch him play and it looked awesome.  




 Congrats and welcome!  




 Looks like he forgot his suit, so he just grabbed a couch cushion and made a jacket out of it.  




 $1,700 bones...I guess I shouldn't be surprised... 









 Whelp that proves it. I'm sure the CCP will issue an apology for the confusion and quietly drop all claims. Nice work boys.  




 You should definitely look into "urban exploration" in Minnesota. Some guys explore abandon buildings and old tunnels, which would make for some pretty cool settings.

 I'd buy it. I also really want to see an Elena + Reno side-story :)  




 A...four button NES controller? *head explodes* 




 Pretty psyched about this. I love MLS and it will be great to finally have a home team to cheer for.  




 It's Yahoo, so they love to blow things way out of proportion. Like they had a story they other day on that Chinese girl who sat in the cockpit of a plane which talked about "International Outrage/Protest/Condemnation"!  




 That was a really great show. 




 Aww yeaaah 




 Wow that is a nice knife 




 Wow, that's a really interesting story. Thanks for posting!  




 Totally agree, I think surrounding peers have a huge influence, even outside of the military. I got married at 25 in a rural part of the country and all my friends asked "what took you so long?" Then I moved to a new job in a big city and I was the only one of my coworkers who was married, and all of them asked "wow, why did you get married so young?"  




 With Persona 5 coming out, this is my plan as well. Doesn't hurt that I can grab Uncharted, Journey, and Last of Us as well.  




 Jesus Christ that's awful... 




 Pretty all much grandparents and great-uncles were in WWII. The impression I got from them and other older folks was "it was just what you had to do". Like there was never really a question about them joining or serving (and they didn't discuss it much), but the country was in need so they did what they had to.  




 47 is too young :(  




 Ah Dreamcast...we barely knew thee. 




 Pilots too. I feel like half the people who have seen Top Gun think you can just stroll up to the recruiter and say "I want to be a pilot. Which way to the fighter jets?"  




 Can't forget [anime Tifa](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081012225221/finalfantasy/images/e/e9/Tifa_Last_Order.png) from FFVII: Last Order

 Totally agree. Doctor's offices, restaurants, the DMV...I seriously see these things everywhere.  




 
It was the first one I learned and I only remembered it because I thought it looked like a "little helicopter" on top. I had bad luck using the "random point" method of ordering in restaurants, so this helped me to not starve during my first trip through China.  




 Any woman that supplies me with endless breadsticks is wife material.  




 We'd use "flip a bitch" in Colorado

 "Come at me bro! I'm standing right here." 




 We were at the Madison farmer's market and were at a fruit stand, when a guy came running up to the owner and goes "Sorry, I bought some apples about an hour ago and gave you a $5 but you gave me back change for a $10, so here's the extra money"  




 Car dealerships are forced to close on Sunday too. That one just blows my mind... 




 Feel bad for the owners...the same thing happened to a shop near me in the Cities. A guy smashed a $1000+ window, jumped inside and stole 3 rolls of of quarters ($30) and a few bags of chips.  




 How do you like the Moto X? I need to upgrade and am deciding between the Moto X and the Razr Maxx.  




 Who won? 




 omg me too! I remember accidentally hitting Select and seeing the square and thinking"what the hell does that do?" 




 "Hmm...yes you seem to have a case of Tiny Leg Syndrome (TLS)...I'm going to prescribe you a regiment of Squats, 3 times per week" 




 That actually wouldn't be a terrible pizza cutter... 




 But the person in the comment I clicked on said they made $8,271 from home last week! Employers hate her!  




 Wow that's awesome looking...I'd love to visit someday 




 No unfortunately not :(  Lots of nights and weekends, especially at the beginning of the year, when clients have the money to do work. Like last week was around 70 hours and this week will be even more. So it's a pretty constant thing.

But it pays well and allows me to take care of my family, so I guess I can't complain. 

 




 I regularly do 60+ just at my job alone. I think the biggest thing for me is that once I'm in my office I do nothing but work until I leave. So maybe it's about picking a location and forcing yourself to go there. It doesn't have to be an office, but maybe go to a library or somewhere where you won't be distracted by "fun" things, and just make it a rule that you are going to spend X number of hours there everyday. 

I think getting into a routine and sticking to it is the biggest thing that helped me.  




 you mean since Prince was on Apollonia? 









 I love stuff like this. I used to keep a folder of all the "real world" Final Fantasy locations I came across.  




 I imagine the recommended way to open this is to grab the bottom rung and do some kind of spin/flip so that the rest of it shoots out to full length in a badass fashion.  




 Oh yeah, I had [this whole set](http://www.cardboardconnection.com/1991-topps-desert-storm-trading-cards) including all the Schwarzkopfs! 

Before the Internet it was a pretty sweet way to browse pictures and facts about all the troops and weapons involved.  




 I was a kid but I remember collecting the Desert Storm trading cards. 









 Yeah second this. I catch my bus at 5:20am so I feel like getting up any earlier would probably be counterproductive.  




 I have the exact opposite problem. I have a huge commute too so I'm out the door at 5am and back home at 7pm. 

I have my treadmill and weights in the basement so it's fairly quiet. You could do a bodyweight routine in the morning which is pretty quiet. 




 "Do you engineers know what the F35 needs? More engines. Did you think about putting one on each wingtip and maybe a few more on the tails? Probably would make it go a lot faster..." 




 Thanks for the reply!
