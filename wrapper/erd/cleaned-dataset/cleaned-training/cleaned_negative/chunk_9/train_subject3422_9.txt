 This happened yesterday as we were on our way on a trip to Italy. As typical as it is our sixteen year old asses got drunk as fuck on the train.

It was three hours after peak, as we began talking. I kinda admitted that I'd had a crush on this girl for the past years. 

Turns out, every guy in my class had one on her aswell...



We want to inform her about this hh...


Tl;dr got drunk on a train. Found out that everyone had the same crush  




 I love the idea!! 














 Aaah didn't know that, thanks. Anyway just found out that our school uses pirated versions of windows 7 ultimate. They're getting the Windows 10 update the legal way (illegally, because they pirated 7) though. 




 oops, ain't gon' edit that just TWELVEFORTY* 




 A windows license key can only be used by one PC at a time.
