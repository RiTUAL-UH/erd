 yeah I know but isn't making friends and networking a part of it? 




 I'm not actually in "the industry" yet! I'm just a student who's done a handful of industry and academic internships! I'm a major in Geomatics/Spatial engineering which is really IMHO a black horse field. Basically, I work with GIS related projects as well as remote sensing and also do programming work with SQL and Matlab related to the GIS stuff. 




 I work with drones/UAVs for mapping projects :) 









 Unless.. you want to work in banking, finance, law, etc.. 





























 That's what people tell me but whenever I look at myself in the mirror, all I see are fats! Even when I touch my body, all I can feel are fats.. 




 Currently I go to the gym 6 times a week but am still on the heavy side. I'm 19 and 181 cm tall and I weight 75 kilos and i'm planning on fasting from all food except for broccoli and water for the next one week. Will it help me lose fats fast? Or will it cause me to lose muscle mass? 









 Why is it not worth it? I don't get it. Would it cost that much to install a security guard for each plane?  




 Yeah but I read that with the low amounts of Marshals they have, no every flight has security for the US anyways. Not sure about other countries.  




 Just curious, Malaysian?  




 I can't see how it would be a bad idea! 




 Yeah it was an Australian.. huge blow up down under. 
























 Hello! I'm currently trying to learn the guitar by myself and am attempting Villa Lobo's Etude no.1. For the right hand, initially I only used my thumb, middle and index finger to pull the strings but videos on the internet show that you are meant to use all your fingers. How is this possible?
