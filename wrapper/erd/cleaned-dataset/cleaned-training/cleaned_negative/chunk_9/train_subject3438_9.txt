 One step at a time, just remember that it's suppose to be fun, try to enjoy really coming up with your characters and story. Make them seem like they are real people in a world you have created for them 




 Just make sure you have most of the plot figured out before writing, it's an awful challenge trying to come up with dialogue and plot motions at the same time.
