 I do a good amount of physical exercise during the course of my job and like to work outside in my yard.  Keeps me from having to go to the gym.  I also don't like sweet foods so I snack on fruits a lot. That helps. 




 Erdogan wants to establish the new Islamic caliphate in Istanbul.

 My dogs' problem turned out to be an easy fix, but, I meant I  hope *your* dog pulls through alright. 









 I know how scary that can be. My dog started to have seizures out of nowhere.  Found out it was the RAID ant spray I was using.  I hope she pulls through ok. 




 Due to an ice/snow storm I got to go home 4 hours early from work.   I had a great nap. 




 There will be an Islamic caliphate centered in Istanbul, Turkey.  Erdogan and Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi are making great progress in setting this up. 




 Turkey was home to the 4th and last Caliphate, abolished in 1924.  The last was Abdulmecid II of the Ottoman Dynasty. He was replaced by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, know as the Father of secular Turkey 1923. He sought to westerize the country which conflicted with conservative Muslm beliefs.  This lead to an identity crisis for the country: go back to our roots in a glorious caliphate that was admired, or become a secular western country.  The man elected as the 12th President, Recep Erdogan,  doesn't like the secular model and is trying to return the country to a caliphate, with himself as the caliph. He views ISIL, and similar groups, as his way to achieve that.  




 They didn't want to have to run after him.  Takes too much effort for that.  Just shoot his ass, that'll stop him. 




 An instant mind-reading device. 




 I don't necessarily think they are.  There have been some ugly babies in our gene pool.
 




 Since Turkey is going to be the center of their eventual caliphate, I'd restrict them to Turkey, but they must allow for people to come and go as they please.  Not everyone supports sharia. 




 Not for years.  I must say, I do miss him cooking for me. 




 Treeninja.  It's a game I play with my niece.
 




 I watch ufo "documentaries".  It's ridiculous, but I do it.

 UPDATE:

Apsara Authority declared that it had arrested two more foreigners for taking nude pictures at Preas Khan temple yesterday.

According to the declaration, Apsara Authority with the cooperation from Tourist Police Unit in Siem Reap and Heritage Protection Division in Siem Reap had prevented the act of taking nude pictures at Preas Khan temple around 10:00 am on 06/ Feb/ 2015.

trafficking pornography and exposing sexual organs

However, the punishment was suspended in accordance with Article 107,109,111 of the Penal Code.

Mr Koy Sao added,  Both of them confessed that they had taken nude pictures at the temple.

Both of them will be expelled from Cambodia tonight by bus from Siem Reap to Bangkok, Thailand.

 In a new development Friday night, the Washington State Patrol said the boyfriend  a 38-year-old man from Miami, Okla.  had been arrested by authorities in Oklahoma late Friday and was booked in jail to await extradition back to Washington.

 You'd need to research whose financial investments are threatened by an analysis of data comparing the health of children vaccinated with those not vaccinated.  I doubt a credible study exists. 




 What a beautiful little child. Congratulations.  




 Must be kin to [this guy](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4019/4251885937_b84e8c0f0a_z.jpg). 




 Alrighty then, in that case, let me refer you to Wilmington, N.C. (great, safe community) or Virginia Beach, Va. (great weather, more jobs). The further south you go, the bigger the mosquitoes and higher the humidity.  




 Depends on what you mean by "mild weather'.  You do know we have high humidity and get hurricanes here, right? 




 Ghost ship. 




 What a beautiful place.  You really have a green thumb. 




 I'm late fifties worrying about nothing and enjoying this fine bottle of Pinot Noir tonight.  You kids shouldn't worry so much about your bills.  They'll get paid, one way or another,  Worry about the man or woman you're sharing your life with, if you have one.  If you don't have one, get a dog.  Or a cat. Or something that's alive and needs you.  Just be glad for this moment, this very minute you're alive.  It's fucking glorious, man.  So many people didn't wake up this morning, but you did.  Worry only gets you high blood pressure and long-term drug dependence, problems with loved ones, intestinal issues and surgery for bleeding ulcers.  Choose to be happy no matter your present conditions.  Go listen to some Pink Floyd and have a nice glass of wine with a friend.  Or alone, either way.  Life is good and it's good to be here on this Earth with all its' beauty and nice clean air and water.  Plus!, we have the benefit of Mexican food.  Holy hell,  we don't need anything else to be happy, unless it's a good blackberry margarita outside under the big umbrella with some fabulous Mexican food.  Life is so good.  I'm so glad I have it.  I might be a fucking hippie in my mind though, so there
 is that.

 NBC should find a more trustworthy replacement for her.  She can no longer be trusted to follow simple instructions for the protection of others and doesn't set a good example at all. 




 You're wrong; it is great.  Very nice when viewing silent underwater scenes.

 Trade-in  your old games at Walmart.  You get a gift card that you can spend any way you want.  I used mine for gas. 




 Here are some  articles that refute that premise:

 I've been paying $18 a month for basic tv for over two years now.  I had it shut off earlier this week and was surprised to find I receive even more channels without it.  With broadband I have no reason to spend the extra money.

 They should start asking for donations to help pay for the damages to the ~~Quik-Mart~~ QuikTrip.

 




 Tell that to the senator who tweeted "Fuck you" to the Governor. 




 Why are local police afforded more personal body armour and weaponry than military forces fighting in war-torn countries?  Shouldn't we be looking at the types of people being hired as police personnel if they're so very willing to follow orders and shoot at innocent civilians?  Who hires these aggressive people? 




 And yours are all anti-Israel in nature, so it doesn't help at all. 




 That bear has better posture than I do. 




 Ferris wheels.  It's just not the same when you aren't 4 ft. tall anymore. 




 Genuine love for other people in all shapes and sizes.  They aren't cutthroat, sleezy and they won't steal from you or stab you in the back.  They'll help take care of you when you get some dread disease and will come to your parties when asked.  They give nice gifts.

 "They took all the trees
 And put 'em in a tree museum.
 Then they charged the people
 A dollar and a half just to see 'em. 

 Don't it always seem to go
 That you don't know what you've got
Til it's gone.
 They paved paradise
 And put up a parking lot."

 What's the point of having it operate so differently on this one subject?  Who's going to decide what's important enough for threads like this and what isn't?  This defeats the purpose of the way reddit operates.  If I wanted randomized, I'd choose randomized.  I cannot tell what's new and what isn't.  I prefer it the regular way.  If I get overburdened with content of one kind or another I just scroll down and skip it.  This takes away choices and I do not support it. 




 From the article:

"A #BBCtrending investigation has found that many of these images are not from the latest conflict and not even from Gaza. Some date as far back as 2009 and others are from conflicts in Syria and Iraq."

 The US has counties larger than that.  It's only 998 sq. miles, so I don't think it could ever be considered a separate state.

 Superiority complex. 




 They're minor things, but everything helps.  After baking something, leave the oven door open so the heat escapes and helps warm up the area.  Also, I cut the leg off a pair of pantyhose and secure it around the end of the dryer vent hose.  The hose in the floor next to the washer blowing out. That heat is also used to heat the area.  I figure, I have to pay once for that heat, why not use it as efficiently as I can  




 Chacarron.  Go ahead...say it. 




 No, I do not believe all people worship the same god.  There is only one God and only one book He says is given by His inspiration, is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness.   




 There's no lost knowledge, it's been written for thousands of years.

The Bible has nearly 800 references to Jerusalem- called the City of our God (Ps. 48:1,8) Jerusalem is Gods city, the city of Zion, he has invested his name there (Daniel 9:19).

Jerusalem is called the city of the great King (Matt.5:35). YHWH is called the God of Israel, He is not called the God of any other nation in this manner, The God of Jerusalem is key to the Jewish people, to Jesus and to the end of the age.

Zion is called the city of God. Isa 60:14: and they shall call you The City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel. It is where the Lord has and will dwell again. Joel 3:21: for the LORD dwells in Zion. When the temple permanently replaced the tabernacle and was built in Jerusalem it became the place of his dwelling, his presence was there, thus name Zion.

Ps. 132:13-14: For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for His dwelling place: This is My resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it. Ps. 87:1-3: His foundation is in the holy mountains. The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God! Selah

 She probably can't find a bra that fits her.   




 I had a horse when I was a kid, a gelding.  Silly thing would fight the dog for leftovers (especially spaghetti) and tried several times to come into the house through the back door.  He could drink Pepsi from a bottle and hardly spill a drop.  He also bit me when I wanted to go left and he wanted to go right.  He bucked my sister off into a ditch filled with tadpoles and she came up with green slimey hair and tadpoles dripping off her face.  I gave him a treat for that one. He was a boss.
