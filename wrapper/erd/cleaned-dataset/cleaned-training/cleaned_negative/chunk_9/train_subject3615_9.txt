another great doc is *Press for Truth* which follows the "New Jersey Girls" as they try to get the USG to form an commission to investigate 9/11...(link on side bar)

David Chandler has done some excellent work...Richard Gage has appeared on C-Span and runs ae911truth.org...

**STRANGE** that the CIA spent untold amounts on operations as well as untold amounts of cash bribing everyone they could in Afghanistan and Pakistan to find out where UBL was...then they finally get lucky--after spending BILLIONS--and have an informer  WALK-IN who worked for the Pakistani ISI come in and cough up UBL's location. 

**STRANGE** that the U.S. gave [Military Aid to Pakistan](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/pakaid.pdf)--over $30 Billion since 9/11. 

**STRANGE** that [Porter Goss and Bob Graham](http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2014/03/17/the-911-joint-congressional-inquiry-and-28-missing-pages/) were with the head of the Pakistan's ISI on 9/11 in Washington DC

 I think Hollywood is fucking bullshit REVISIONIST HISTORY which alters and brainwashes the public to accept the Perpetual Wars of the USA.

The main stream media are fucking Pentagon BOOTLICKERS--they want WAR, they PROFIT from WAR--and they will be happy to lead America into another USELESS TRILLION DOLLAR WAR this summer. 














 You should check out [**CORE OF CORRUPTION**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhdReD6MAo)--the music is a little annoying but the totality of questions raised is astounding. the best 9/11 doc is [**THE NEW PEARL HARBOR**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMkyL_YJDUc) which is about 6 hours (if you don't want to commit 6 hours--just check out the last 2 chapters on the WTC complex which clocks in at 2 hours) 









 You might want to look into the Pentagon-Hollywood ties...apparently many Hollywood blockbusters work hand-in-hand with the Pentagon Propaganda Department (which demands rewrites of the scripts in exchange for access to military equipment or MONEY). 

As for Ebert--I grew up in Chicago being exposed to his non-stop overrating of Hollywood 1-star Blockbusters.  




 Former NSA Insiders Thomas Drake, William Binney (et al.) wrote an open letter to POTUS in January, 2014...

------------------

Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."

 They should have thrown *The 9/11 Commission Report* in there, too. 




 You can read up on the CIA at r/TSBD--I highly recommend the 2007 Non-Fiction Book of the Year *LEGACY OF ASHES: THE HISTORY OF THE CIA* by Tim Weiner. It's very well-written with short 10-15 page chapters--lots of eye-popping quotes as well.

EDIT: hmmm...seems like there is something the gatekeepers don't want people to know 









 The CIA at this point has been proven to have: 

+ Tortured (some even died as a result) 

+ Obstructed investigations (the CIA destroyed about 90 videotapes while involved in a U.S. court case, the 9/11 Commission also wrote an editorial in the *New York Times* stating their investigation was obstructed by the White House and CIA) http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/

+ Spied on U.S. citizens on U.S. soil--including U.S. senators (last year the CIA was caught lying about spying on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence during their investigation into CIA torture) http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/07/31/234997/cia-staffers-accessed-senate.html

+ Imported drugs to the U.S. (Iran-Contra)

+ Money Laundering (BCCI)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act

The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because he did not actually commit the crime personally.[1]

John Judge said it has "10 times more man power and 100 times the budget of the CIA." 














 The Pentagon also has NO RESTRICTIONS on directing propaganda towards a U.S. audience now. Michael Hastings said the DoD has 27,000 people working on Public Relations under a $4.5 Billion yearly budget. Hastings also revealed the military has directed Psy Ops which targeted U.S. senators in order to effect the budget.

 The tax laws are written by the Rich for the Rich. Now the corporations are writing all the laws--they literally write them and give them over to senators/representatives. Chris Hedges says it has been a "slow motion corporate coup d'etat". This is a long interview he did on C-Span...worth the watch --he covers corporatocracy, the death of journalism, the inequality of the "common man" 

http://www.c-span.org/video/?303072-1/depth-chris-hedges 




 Ike said he left his successor a Legacy of Ashes--then JFK (his successor) was assassinated 2 years later. RFK, Jr. recently said he thinks "rogue elements" of the CIA killed JFK. 

JFK inherited The Bay of Pigs operations and CIA Director Allen Dulles when he entered office--Dulles would be fired by JFK after it fell apart.  









 AWESOME...Back in the days when a loft was a LOFT...and 12 year-old could buy a pack of smokes for 75 cents!!! 




 Can't believe no one watched this--apparently the Ugly known unknown is too dark a path for Americans to face. I was surprised when I heard Errol Morris was doing this doc; but then Rumsfeld is such a close clone of Robert McNamara its quite scary--so the film was basically a Part II to *Fog of War*. 

I think Errol Morris is a talented film maker but is extremely misguided in allowing the two War Criminals such a soft, dreamy setting to say their Final Peace. McNamara liked to play with numbers, Rumsfeld tittillates himself with words--but they both enriched themselves by waging war against countries which never threatened U.S. mainland soil. 

Errol Morris dedicating the film to Roger Ebert, who pushed Hollywood escapism (American propaganda) onto Americans for decades, was a fitting ending. 




 Ike certainly had some fine moments--but it wasn't all rosy in the White House...This is from one of my favorite books...

-----

Jan. 5, 1961: At the last, Dwight Eisenhower exploded in anger and frustration. "The structure of our intelligence organization is faulty," he told Allen Dulles. It makes no sense, it has to be reorganized, and we should have done it long ago. Nothing had changed since Pearl Harbor. "I have suffered an eight-year defeat on this," said the President of the United States. He said he would "leave a legacy of ashes" to his successor.

from *Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA* by Tim Weiner, page 194 (free pdf at r/TSBD)

 Did he thump his bible before or after he said that? 




 ...or they could PROSECUTE some of these White Collar Criminals--obviously not every one of the corporations can be convicted in that manner...but out of 6,300 settlements there is a very, very low percentage of Criminal Prosecutions.

For example: If you or I committed mortgage fraud--we would be most likely be prosecuted in a criminal court and in a civil court...but if a corporation engages in systemic mortgage fraud--they just make a settlement and pay a fine 99% of the time. 




 If someone commits mortgage fraud--we would be PROSCUTED, pay a fine and most likely do some jail time...if a corporation and its employees engage in systemic mortgage fraud--they just pay a fine 99% of the time...

we are talking about RAMPANT CORPORATE CRIMINALITY by White Collar Criminals. 




 did you scroll down to AT T? 

...its a lot more than that--one settlement was for 956 million in 2011...and that's just in the USA 









 The corporations have no effective oversight--just because settlements are common does not make them ok. especially since these are flagrant violations of price-fixing, product misrepresentation, mortgage fraud, etc.

The U.S. is facing extreme turbulence from the rampant corporatism--this has spread to the to the Wars for Profit which we are now entrenched in. The corporate media will print anything the Pentagon or POTUS spits out (only rarely bothering to actually investigate...often the original story will be false, but the effect of the original false story will have achieved its objective). 




 That would be 6,300+ settlements with corporations which the USG has made--with NO PROSECUTION...no one goes to jail from FRAUD (etc.)...

[**NO WRONGDOING HERE, JUST 6,300 SETTLEMENTS**](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/05/no-wrongdoing-here-just-6300-corporate-fines-and-settlements.html)

"This spreadsheet is all the corporate fines/settlements Ive been able to find sourced articles about, mostly in the period from the 1990s up to today (with a few 80s and 70s). This is by far the most comprehensive list of such things online. At least that I could find, because the lack of any decent list is what made me start compiling this list in the first place.        

What struck me was the sheer number of corporate violations of laws and regulationsthousands upon thousands, the vast majority of which occurred since corporate profits began their incredible ascent in the early 2000sand the list of those paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and settlements, which reads like a whos who of Corporate America and Top 100 Global Corporations.

Many have a long list of fines and settlements, and many of the fines are in excess of $100 million. Many are for blatant cartel price-fixing, not disclosing the dangers of the companys heavily promoted medications, destroying documents to thwart an investigation of wrong-doing, etc."

 got to pay for the useless wars and fake cybercrime somehow 




 REMOVED from r/politics because--as we all know--TAXES have nothing to do with POLITICS. 


































 well constructed article...as for myself--I prefer to go on the OFFENSIVE and have started calling those who watch and believe the main stream media BOOTLICKERS--because they merely repeat whatever the latest Pentagon-CIA-State Department press release says...

Michel Chossudovsky has recently stated that WE SHOULD BE WAGING A WAR WITH THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA...as a nation we are allowing these corporations to mold our minds into jelly and continue useless wars for profit...Over 1 million dead in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Pakistan since 9/11 due to the US "War on Terror"...millions more have been turned into refugees and had their way of life ruined and their families destroyed...

I have also begun to see the NYT, WaPo, cbs (etc.) as basically "State Sponsored" and recently mentioned on r/theInside that the MSM links should be immediately labeled as such (flair added). They liked the idea--but it hasn't gone into action yet (hopefully they will implement it soon--not sure). 









 pretty sure that the Germans said they received some gold back... 




 (from wiki)

The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because he did not actually commit the crime personally.[1] 









 This documentary asks [**The Secret World of Gold**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfVQ8WvkIiQ) asks an expert if he thinks all the gold is there...(appx. 37 minutes in)

The doc also alleges that the Bank of England "rented" some of their gold to Switzerland which then melted the gold down and SOLD IT to be used in jewelry. This opens the possibility that the US confiscated every citizen's gold in 1933--then turned around and "rented" the gold so the SERFS could buy their own gold back in the form of expensive jewelry. 




 WHY trust the U.S. military--which has LIED and LIED and LIED and LIED and LIED and LIED and LIED...??? 









 I posted up one of Robert Parry's articles on Iran-Contra in r/politics one time--just as you said the user comments by claiming its a loony conspiracy, then the user bashed consortium.com (even though Robert Parry worked for the *AP*)...I'm just glad that we are finally seeing quite a few journalists walking from the MSM--but still, as Chossudovsky said: "WE NEED TO BE WAGING WAR AGAINST THE MSM"

Otherwise, the masses will just continue consuming--and the U.S. will continue with the Endless Wars for Profit.

 Just watched this interview Michel Chossudovsky did with James Corbett--he made some comments on the media:

---------------

"We are dealing with a media apparatus which turns realities upside-down...presents the western quest and military adventure as a peace making undertaking...which lies in regards to the casualties of war...which presents the war criminals as protagonists of human rights...and that in itself is the pinnacle of this system.

Without the Main Stream Media and war propaganda this New World Order agenda doesn't have a leg to stand on. In other words, without these media lies the military agenda, the economic agenda would collapse like a deck of cards. And that is why it is absolutely fundamental that--within the realm of independent media and alternative media--**we wage a war against the main stream media**."

--[Michel Chossudovsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtLABW149Ss) (appx. 18min 20sec...emphasis mine)

 Makes me think of when I was young and ABC news decided to begin a late-night news program: *NIGHTLINE*. The purpose was to update Americans on the U.S. Hostage Situation in Iran. Every day the news media counted off how many days the situation had gone on: DAY 100...DAY 200...DAY 300...DAY 400...the number was on the Front Page of the newspaper and included in every newscast--the nation was at a fever pitch.

But NOT ONCE do I remember any newspaper or news program mentioning that the Hostage Situation was BLOWBACK for what the U.S. did in 1953 when the CIA helped to Overthrow Iran's government.

I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't used as a template for study within the Pentagon-CIA...How easy it is to get an entire nation to HATE. 

We know the Pentagon-CIA work with Hollywood and the "news" media--what if CNN and Fox "news" were actually created *from the very beginning* with input from the CIA-Pentagon? If they do it with movies--why not extend the reach and do it with cable news?

 I'll bet the NBA-ESPN-TNT-ABC conglomerate made Shaq take the post down--pretty sure those long contracts don't allow players/commentators to express political beliefs. They can have their opinions but must keep quiet. Once in a while they might let it slide, but not during the Finals...and not on the subject of 9/11 being an inside job. 




 There is no record of what was said--pretty sure the Commissioners were forbidden from taking notes (and there was definitely no transcipt taken). I don't think the public was even allowed to know how long the meeting was...Another question to ask: WHY was this video taken down by C-Span?

 Actually, the $40 million which the SSCI funded went entirely to CIA-approved attorneys--so they could splice, dice and redact the 6,400 page Torture Report down to 400 pages (which We, the Serfs could read). 

On the other hand, the 9/11 Commission had offices in a CIA managed building with a staff of 84 people which included attorneys and basic office staff. The 9/11 Commission was also placed under a strict time frame of 16 months--while the Torture Report Re-Write Team was given 4 years to complete the editing of a report which was already finished. (note: the 9/11 Commission was eventually given another $10 million and paid no rent for the office space in the CIA-managed building...cough cough)

With last year's revelation of the SSCI being spied upon by the CIA--I wonder if the CIA also spied on the 9/11 Commission. We do know, from an editorial the 9/11 Commission Co-Chairs wrote to the *New York Times*, that they accused the CIA and the White House of [**OBSTRUCTING THE INVESTIGATION**](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) 




 NSFW photos of torture victims 




 If you re-watch the video you might pick up on a few things they say: "we're just a few hours into this"..."the president in his first remarks earlier today" etc...the video with "earlier" labeled...

No apparent "voice-overs" or apparent splices in the video that I've noticed. Unlike many youtube videos, this copy seems to be very high quality...you might be able to do a search for news transcripts   plug in the baltimore station, the date and L. Paul Bremer--see if anything pops up.

edit: even crazier is that L. Paul Bremer had an office in one of the WTC towers--yet did NOT even mention that (or his co-workers) in this interview. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bremer 




 It's one of the best documentaries on 9/11...just saying if you don't feel like committing to a 6+ hour doc--start with the last 2 chapters. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ca1HsC6MH0 




 Try Chapters 6   7 of [*A NEW PEARL HARBOR*](http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle artid=167) on for size...

(the entire documentary is 6 hours...but the last 2 chapters are 2 hours) 




 I also wish everyone out there would watch this [**GW Bush Press Conference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) which lasts 5 minutes and includes just 5 questions. He had just finished meeting with the 9/11 Commission--but GWB wouldn't agree to do so IN PUBLIC or ON THE RECORD...Notice GWB stammers at the very beginning because he Can't say he "testified" (because he wasn't under oath)...

For years all us Americans heard from the White House was [**"9/11"..."9/11"..."9/11"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMkyL_YJDUc)...but GWB couldn't even answer more than 5 questions to the press after meeting up with the 9/11 Commission? GWB even had to bring along Dick Cheney (and a slew of attorneys) to the meeting to hold his hand...

appropriately enough, the press conference ends with the sounds of sirens in the background--Police State USA. 




 Try asking the 1 million+ DEAD Iraqis (since the 2003 U.S. invasion) if the U.S. military is worse than Saddam.

 "It is the function of the CIA to keep the world unstable, and to propagandize and teach the American people to hate and fear, so we will let the Establishment spend any amount of money on arms.

--John Stockwell, former CIA Operations Officer 




 FUCK Dick Cheney--he was on the oversight committee for Iran-Contra...after Cheney stopped the investigation from going too far he was rewarded a post as Sec. of Defense under the new President: GHW Bush...when GHWB lost the re-election Cheney landed at Halliburton--but not before he funded a study on the effectiveness of Privatizing functions of the military...

After 9/11 [**Dick Cheney asked Sen. Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0)...Cheney/Bush stalled the formation of the 9/11 Commission for over a year--then under-funded the commission. The 9/11 Commission was initially funded with $3 million (compare that to the $40 million initial funding which the SSCI Torture Report Re-Write received in Dec. 2008).

 Here's an excellent editorial about L. Paul Bremer's actions in Iraq...As far as disbanding the Iraqi Army and the Ba'ath Party--how many of them are now in ISIS?

Now watch L. Paul Bremer on Baltimore's local nbc affiliate on 9/11...is this scripted?

 Some people will do *anything* for money.

Still nothing compared to CIA attorneys rationalizing TORTURE and DoD attorneys rationalizing the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam. 




 Most likely used kitty litter in place of a much more expensive product, thereby swindling more money out of the USG. 




 No one at NSA charged with any crime. 

The End.

 AWESOME.

 




 Yes, unfortunately, every President is now SANITIZED with gratuitous praise--then they enshrine themselves with these bullshit multi-million dollar *Presidential Libraries*. The politicians and the government agencies are being allowed to Cover-Up their tracks with Excessive Secrecy--the actual Reality of what happened no longer matters--it is the Myth that will live on. 

LBJ was sometimes called "The Senator from the Pentagon" but the history books will erase that and paint LBJ as a President who stood-in and led the nation in our time of need. In the future, if the actual Truth ever does get printed--the masses won't be able to comprehend the divide between the Official Story from those which actually took place.  




 Often, the proof of U.S.-CIA Fuckery only comes out years later...there is a list of known, documented U.S. overthrows which author William Blum put together in an appendix of his book a few years ago...(you can see a pdf of one of his books at r/TSBD)

 the comments would have been even worse if the nazi mods at imgur hadn't "pulled it" from the Current Events category. I couldn't believe one commenter "hoped I'd be added to a list"...how American: guy says something I don't like--let's have him spied on! 




 The towers didn't fucking Fall--they were blown to fucking smithereens. Dust. 




 Yes, r/worldnews readers--you are being conned. Besides the obvious outright censorship of websites and subject matter, the larger subs also partake in SWITCHING OFF THE COUNTER for articles which they don't like. Supposedly this is just a natural function of reddit to keep the articles circulating and not sit atop the front page too long.

A post I made yesterday ([an Italian article which interviewed Vladimir Putin](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3907i8/vladimir_putin_i_invite_you_to_publish_a_world/)) made me realize this was going on--once it got to the Top Spot, the counter was turned off--no more up votes calculated. The counter on my post went off at 4800 votes or so...odd, right now there are two posts on the worldnews front page with over 5600 votes...

Most people would never notice this--just thought I'd fill you in... 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Deceit

basically the author (a WWII Navy Veteran) came across records in the National Archives--wrote a book which showed the U.S. had foreknowledge of the Pearl harbor attack...then some of the records went missing from the National Archives (others were obtained thru the FOIA).

Interesting that NeoCon Philip Zelikow argues against Stinnett's research (included on the wiki page).

Here's a lecture by the author Robert Stinnett: http://www.c-span.org/video/?157339-1/book-discussion-day-deceit-truth-fdr-pearl-harbor 









 The amount of information--which Americans turn their noses up at--is startling:

+ [James Steele](http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/mar/06/james-steele-america-iraq-video) training Iraqi death and torture squads in Iraq--how many of these guys ended up in ISIS?

+ The widespread use of torture and degrading treatment by the U.S. military, the CIA and their contractors

+ The gigantic amount of money unaccounted for by the Pentagon--estimated at [$8.5 Trillion](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget)  









 Either over the winter or last fall, the U.S. media all started chirping the same story about Venezuela being a threat to the U.S.--which was laughable, so I posted the annual military budgets for each...but, YES, the U.S. thru the CIA and its Economic Hit Men have certainly manipulated and taken advantage of the countries in Central and South America. 

Now imagine Venezuela's problem but 1,000 times bigger--that's what we have in the U.S.--our politicians are bought by corporations, our laws are made by corporations and our wars are planned by WAR, INC. 




 100% political--if the fucking scum in DC really cared about corruption they'd be going after bankers, but, NO--they make BILLION dollar settlements with them... 




 That's a FALSE STATEMENT...Quit Lying. 




 ae911truth.org should have some flyers with basic info... 




 "When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book."

--Philip Agee quote from *INSIDE THE COMPANY: A CIA DIARY*

(free pdf at r/TSBD) 




 The only one I've read is *Deep Politics and the Death of JFK*...great read--can't wait to get *The American Deep State*. 




 nice introduction here by a fellow author...special guest appearance by Daniel Ellsberg... 




 The U.S. has tried to overthrow Venezuela for quite a long time--could this fraud be just one more reason for the recent amping-up of the vilification of Venezuela? To be clear: I'm sure there most likely is drug dealing and corruption in Venezuela--but if Venezuela cut-off this Energy deal and threatened to expose the fraud, perhaps it has to do with the recent U.S. allegations? 




 To be clear: The ads were Not allowed...but the bulk mailing was? 









 US: 800+ (some go as high as 1100+)

Russia: 18

 U.S. has over 800...Russia under 20 (check wikipedia)

 no sh*t...they have also "frozen" the counter for the last 2 hours. 




 "off-topic" in r/politics (lasted longer than I thought)...holy sh#t--5,000+ comments in r/worldnews...

EDIT: apparently the mods have FROZEN the counter--it was at 4752 an hour ago...went up above 4800--then in just 3 minutes fell back to 4752...has on moved to 4754 in last hour...think they want the Snowden story to bump it out of top spot.currently over 7500+ comments--most of them 1 liners. 




 Good point--the Cabal could use it to send a message though--in which case I would expect something *sooner* rather than later.

As for Horseface John--it seems a little under the radar considering he's the SoS. 




 hmmm...I wonder how long before the mods of r/worldnews and r/politics take this post down. 
























 I agree--either a plane will go down...or, more likely, he'll get the Michael Hastings treatment. 




 I actually liked this film--hadn't seen it in a long time....I guess there's a new low-budget 9/11 movie coming out: OPERATION TERROR. 




 I noticed I couldn't find Paperclip docs which were on an archive site (which had gwu in the address)--figured it might just be google fucking up search results...

gives more for the USG to blame on the Chinese... 




 this is DISINFO...martin bormann was about 20 years younger than that POS ghw bush. bormann was in WWI--he was in the back working as a clerk for an officer. ghw bush was in WWII--served time in the pacific as an airman (he was supposedly "the youngest pilot"). 














 FYI: The Corporate Media receives quite a bit of money from the DoD; therefore thay are Pentagon Bootlickers--which mainly suggests they are incapable of investigating or criticizing the DoD. The goal is to deceive the American public (mission accomplished).

And, YES, reddit--thru their nazi adminstrators and mods--are signed and sealed Pentagon Bootlickers as well. 




 I was being sarcastic...a nation of 250 million beating up on a nation of 91,000. 




 [U.S. Invasion of Grenada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Grenada) in which 5,000 bootlickers received medals?

 no idea--but he has done interviews where he dressed in a short sleeve (more of his tats were showing) 




 so how the F#CK did this go from 7 upvotes/4 downvotes to 1up/1down?

edit: I downloaded an app that allows you to see the up/down votes

edit 2: now the up/down votes don't even show--except for the OTHER POSTS...Pentagon BOOTLICKERS know no bounds.

 F#ck...the only book I ever bought on the CIA which I was unable to finsh was *A QUESTION OF TORTURE: CIA INTERROGATION FROM THE COLD WAR TO THE WAR ON TERROR* by Alfred W. McCoy...very, very DARK. 




 We the People would never know... 









 when you pay think tank consultants billions upon billions of dollars year after year--they will feed LIES that confirm what the DoD wants to hear... 




 I would say it's much more a product of megalomania--Hitler and Stalin would have loved to have this ability. 




 $47K to save a multi-billion dollar program which would allow the DIA to track EVERYONE on the planet...well worth the cover-up expenses (from the DIA point of view). 














 My latest theory is that OPERATION DARKHEART (which tracked Al Qaeda cells via open source communications--and located at least 4 of the hijackers in the USA at least 1 year prior to 9/11) was not intended to catch hijackers...OPERATION DARKHEART was intended as a TRIAL--it was research by the DIA for a project which would go into effect after 9/11 once the funding was provided. The DIA didn't want Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer to inform Congressional investigators because they didn't want the investigators digging deeper into the project and asking what the project was designed to do. 




 or getting SET UP on bumpkus charges... 




 Dirty Cops...The thousands of obscurities surrounding 9/11...The illegal, useless wars for profit...Depleted Uranium...The $8.5 Trillion fraud at the Pentagon...CIA-US military (and their contractors) Systemic Torture of prisoners...US spying on its own citizens--both in an En Masse manner and on those expressing Dissent...The for-profit prison system in the USA...The complicit Corporate Press which simply regurgitates the US government's positions--without any On the Record sources or verifiable evidence...

I could go on and on...The question at this point is: will TRUTH, REALITY and JUSTICE ever meet again? Or will society keep growing farther apart?

 Pretty sure I've seen at least 3 other US stations doing so as well--cbs, cnn and a local NY station. 




 US also used the same kind of story when Obama was meeting with China's leader and the Snowden story was breaking...
