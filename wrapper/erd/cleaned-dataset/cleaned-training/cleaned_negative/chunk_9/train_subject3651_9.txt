The scientists ran an in-depth statistical analysis to find out whether pesticides, human land use or other factors may have contributed to declining bumblebee populations over the past century. And the answer is clearly nowe checked this carefully, Pindar says. They are impacted by climate change and these effects are already very large and widespread.

That's a quote in this article, from the lead author on the new study, published in the most prestigious scientific journal in the world. They confirmed through statistical analyses that climate change and NOT pesticides or land use were to blame.

 yeah...not according to the *real* scientists (nice try, though) 




 Monsanto isn't a vague boogie monster? 




 Indeed. The study was literally published in the top scientific journal in the world (give or take "Nature" journals). 




 Bumblebee drones don't have feelings anyway. Also, drones.  














 Bumblebees are clearly liberals, looking for excuses to tax the rich.
