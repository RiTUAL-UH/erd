 I don't. Intel is misleading as hell. They are currently replacing former Haswell-based Celerons and Pentiums that cost $100-$160, with Atoms, and calling them the same. And the worst part is nobody is really figuring it out. Intel is selling $30 chips for $160. 




 Indeed.

 The battery life sucks because it has to do emulation (especially for games). 




 But very few performance improvements since Sandy Bridge. 







































 Also what about pardoning Chelsea Manning and publicly calling Snowden a whistleblower and giving him immunity to return to US? 




 We did it, Roddit! 

















































 With a title like that, the article doesn't deserve to be read, even if the total opposite is displayed in the article (which I assume isn't the case here anyway). 







































 Giving the fingerprint data to a 3rd party or even a 2nd party's servers is *never* acceptable.

Plus, there now ways to use a fingerprint to authenticate to a third party site, too. Check out Microsoft's Passport technology, which will also be part of FIDO 2.0. It will authenticate [locally](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-passport-passwordless-login,28767.html), and then create a public key to authenticate you to another site (or something along those lines). Your fingerprint data will never have to leave the device to log you to other sites.


So we only have to wait a year or so until we get that. There's no need to risk our fingerprints to someone else's servers right now. 



















 "What exactly ar you worried about if people have your password to all websites you'll ever sign-up to in the future"

- he asks. 




 What do you do with the 99% who will have no idea they are sending their fingerprints to the Chinese government and who knows how many other hackers in China.

Remember you can't actually *change* your fingerprint if it's take like this. This would affect you for the rest of your life, and we're only going to use fingerprint readers more in the future. You don't want it to be in the hackers' databases and rival countries' databases.

This is MUCH WORSE than them having your social security number. 




 What the actual fuck? Why the hell would I want my device to be fully authenticated and logged in **before I receive it**?

OnePlus needs to die as a company just for suggesting this enormous stupidity. 




 Horrifying. As if there isn't enough Chinese hacking going on. Now they're asking us to *willingly* giving them our fingerprints.

Fuck off, OnePlus!

 Ars Technica, along with other sites, can you please *stop* giving these psychopaths a platform on which to advertise their messages?

 Nope:

 But Nokia/the division Microsoft bought made 95% of the Windows Phones on the market.

And something doesn't have to be dead DEAD to be called that. For instance, Blackberry is dead...yet the company still makes phones. 





























 Hillary Clinton is not the only alternative, you know? 







































 Really? You'd want to use Windows 7 on a 5" screen? I find even 10" screens impractical for a full OS like Windows. 




 But why?! 









 Considering 14nm only "technically" came out in 2014 (like in the last 2 weeks of the year and in like 2 machines), but in reality it shipped most devices in 2015, I don't think we'll see Intel's 10nm until 2017. If anything Intel's process delays have been increasing lately as they try to move to smaller process nodes. 




 So call for a hearing and ask them about it, rather than throwing wild accusations. 














 Blackberry is giving out its encryption keys to governments around the world (*especially* consumers' keys). I wouldn't put much trust into their "security". 



















 Since we're on the crazy speculation train, here's one for you.

"Anonymous" could be anyone, including the FBI. In fact the last time "Anonymous" was a strong group and did all of those "operations", one of their main guys, who had a role in *coordinating* the attacks, was an [FBI mole](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/hacker-sabu-defends-informing-anonymous-fbi-interview).

So what if it's the FBI that hacked the NYSE, in the same day that the chief of FBI was doing a [Senate hearing](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/07/08/fbi-doj-name-new-enemy-crypto-wars-apple-google/) on encryption backdoors and trying to tell the world how we're all doomed if they don't get their backdoors?

Too crazy for the FBI to be trying to do a false flag operation like that just to get the US population to support encryption backdoors (their holy grail apparently), especially when they seem pretty desperate that the House is against their proposals (seen in the last 2 House hearings)?! 

Would that be  more or less crazy than FBI ["assisting"](http://fair.org/home/zero-for-40-at-predicting-attacks-why-do-media-still-take-fbi-terror-warnings-seriously/) dozens of [terrorist plots](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/terror-factory-fbi-trevor-aaronson-book) on U.S. soil?

Or it could be only a technical error, like the NYSE has [already said](https://www.nyse.com/market-status/history). 




 Or MS writing off again [aQuantive](http://allthingsd.com/20120702/microsoft-writing-off-nearly-all-of-the-6-3-billion-it-paid-for-aquantive/) for another $6.3 billion.

And I bet in 2-3 years they'll write off the $8 billion Skype acquisition, too, because there's no way they will recover that money by the half of the 21st century. Unless they're counting all [DoD contracts](http://www.geekwire.com/2013/score-microsoft-defense-department-windows/) as [ROI](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/12/nsa_offers_billions_for_skype_pwnage/) for the [Skype business](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2220079/microsoft-subnet/microsoft-patent-may-ruin-skype--may-make-voip-spy-and-pry-easy-for-gov-t.html). 




   Is America under attack again?

I don't even know what that means. You realize American corporations, just like UK corporations and German corporations and Chinese corporations are hit by hacking attempts all the time, right?

It seems silly to phrase it that way. 





























 [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/). 
























 So...do people still believe that Nokia made the right choice picking Windows Phone, now that not only Windows Phone failed, but the whole company got disassembled by the company that got it into this mess - Microsoft? 




































































































































































 Also, I think the author is forgetting Android M will allow users to "adopt" SD card storage as internal storage. 




 Or [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/)? And maybe in combination with [Snow](https://github.com/zrm/snow) for further client anonymity. 







































 Says ExtremeTech, the technology-oriented website that doesn't use encryption. 












































 Will the deals be more or less misleading than the Black Friday ones? I think there was a statistics made after last year's Black Friday and something like only 1% were *actual* deals. The rest were scams (inflated prices that got "discounted"). 




 Please don't. 




  But this slow, calculated approach to releasing Windows 10 can only be a good thing. It shows a lot of foresight and careful planning,

Oh what a load of crap. This is because Windows 10 couldn't be finished on time. So they decided to release it only to a small group first to make sure their unfinished Windows 10 doesn't brick too many people's PCs.

/r/Microsoft seems to be a bigger circlejerk than /r/androidcirclejerk - and the latter is ironic.  




 Do you really think 1/4 of the *total Windows userbase* (including those on 10 year old PCs and enterprise customers) are going to 1) know about the Windows 10 release day and 2) want to download the Windows 10 upgrade in the same day?

A bit optimistic don't you know? Like by about an order of magnitude or two?

Like 95% of Windows consumers get Windows with a new laptop not through upgrades. 














 Last I checked Aether was pretty slow. Could you rewrite it in Golang? I think that would better support multiple users and would also be a memory safe language.

Also, any way you can tie [this](https://github.com/zrm/snow) into it for anonymity purposes or is that something only the users or the OS vendors could enable? 




 What about [this](https://github.com/zrm/snow)? 




















































































 This is more about companies using such encryption in a way that they don't infringe on the users' privacy, but can still perform useful operations on that data. 




















































































 Nu. Ce e cu atata "reunificare" dupa zeci si sute de ani? O luam si noi pe urma Rusiei? Incepem sa cerem si ce pamanturi ne-o mai fi luat Ungaria si Ucraina dupa aia?

Mi se pare stupid sa vii dupa 100 de ani sa "ceri pamantul inapoi" sau chestii de genul. Pe urma acestor lucruri se pornesc multe razoaie, care ar fi putut fi completat evitate daca nu ar exista lacomia (pentru resurse...ceea ce nu e cazul aici) si simtul asta de "reunificare".

Si nici nu mai vorbesc de faptul ca o reunificare cu Republica Molvoda ne-ar saraci pe toti, pentru ca Romania ar trebui sa dea lor si celor de acolo pentru pensii, scoli, drumuri si toate cele, la fel de multi cum se da si aici. 














 Okay. 




 "forced" to do it...if we want them to give us those big fat [DoD contracts](http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/04/us-department-of-defense-signs-617-million-windows-8-deal/).

 With 4k display!

Because OEMs can never miss an opportunity to cancel out any battery life improvements they might be adding to their phones through some other piece of technology. 




 Yes and no. They also released Z2 soon after the Z1, and it was just as stupid then.
