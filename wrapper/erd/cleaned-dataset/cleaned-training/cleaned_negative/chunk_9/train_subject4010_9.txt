 Aussie with an American father, though I did live in the states for a couple of years while learning to talk. Half my family sounds either or American or Australian, but only one of the 6 of us are actually born there.

As for the the topic - maybe a shorter video on how Brad Bird injects charm into his work. Another idea is a video covering the works of cinematographers Christopher Doyle, Conrad L. Hall and maybe Roger Deakins. The final idea I'm also keen on is spatial clarity in action sequences - comparing directors like Nolan to guys like Johnnie To. 




 Thanks, I appreciate that. Unfortunately, I had cheekbone and jaw surgery last week and it's left me unable to talk properly. It'll probably remain that way for another month or so as I recover, and I didn't want to this wait on a shelf for a month. I'm trying to develop a flow of getting a video out every 4-6 weeks, and I didn't think that would help it.

Anyway, thanks for checking it out.
