 No you shouldn't be eligible for a refund.  This is the risk you take with airbnb.  If you want hotel accommodations get a hotel.  You found three cockroaches so friggin what.  I had an ant problem at my house for about a month, we live in a world with bugs, deal with it. 




 Yep, I have clear pictures of my home and how it lacks a lot of decor and I'm a bachelor which should give some insight into how it is decorated.  Don't matter, people still complain about how empty the house is. 




 You get that on any region specific subreddit it's obnoxious.  Hey I'm visiting Vermont?  What should I do?  Well look at the history of the past 300 times a person has asked that and you might have a good idea. 




 Will OP deliver? 




 Hang in there little buddy, lots of fish in the sea 




 I second this holds really well, and the holder release is a really simple really clever device. 




 Id invite you to my party? 




 Got any links about the profit statement?  The only reason I would think Airbnb isn't making a profit is because they are focused on putting all their revenue into funding growth. 




 No way.  First off take what the previous poster said with a grain of salt they take third review system very seriously.  Second as a host I set my own prices so I'm not really an independent contractor like uber or homejoy.  Airbnb is more of a marketing platform for short term rentals that you pay a fee on for each reservation. 




 Got an after pic of how it healed?

Edit: nevermind 




 Wasn't going to watch the video but your comment piqued my curiosity.  She is a dime. 




 Really?  That makes no sense that a flag detail costs the same as a police detail.
