 I completely get your criticism. It gets me a bit agitated looking at as well, sometimes, just because I question whether it has any composition at all. I was trying to evoke the same feel the book cover for The Lost World gave off.

 I rehosted it from [my own website](http://www.maazcon.com/#/jurassic-world/). Sorry, forgot to link it in the comments. 









 **APPLE BOTTOM JEANS** 




 Plaaaaaaayyyyyaaaaa 




 Oblivion 




 He pop that police on a Monday 









 Yeah, but it's shit compared to their mixtapes. I wish they didn't end on such bad terms with their last producer. 




 You're perfect just the way you are. 




 Thank you. This is an absolute necessity now that you brought it to my attention. 




 I'm still struggling with how to approach that Skills section... Thanks for letting me know. I'll add that as a change. 




 Thanks. It's a relief to know I already had that first criticism in mind. I have a few galleries with multiple pictures up, but need to follow through with the entire site.

Fragments... ahhh, never again. (That app was such a guilty pleasure the first week I got it.)

I'll get to work on a printer-fiendly version of that resume, too. Really appreciate your response!

 THE EMPIRE 




 Do you sell prints of this, by any chance? 




 HUM NE AAHG LAGAIYE? 




 If his short film *Runaway* is anything to go off of, it'll be pretty damn extravagant. 




 k bye 




 You guys are too kind.

A bit of background on the serious faces. The picture of my grandfather was taken right after he was in the middle of a huge accident. As far as my dad can remember, he had a few broken ribs, and he was getting treated around the time this was taken.


...My picture was taken before I left to study for finals. But that's a story for another day. 




 Ha! Hopefully I get to keep the hair too.. 




 ...Dude... 




 Thank you. 

Pakistani. But that's the first time I've ever gotten that. That would be awesome.  




 In my defense, he was in his forties in that picture. I'm 22 in this. 

...still a bit slow for the facial hair but I'm keeping my hopes up.  




 Oh man. He in general was more badass. 




 I got you.

Here's [mine](http://i.imgur.com/wRvW1bl.jpg), and here's [his](http://i.imgur.com/8P31kDp.jpg).

I don't feel like I look anywhere near as badass, though. 









 David Fincher's movies always have the best packaging. I wouldn't be surprised if he has something to do with it - he started off filming commercials, so the dude definitely knows his marketing. 














 Sorry for the double response - just needed to add something. I see what you're seeing with the fat chin thing. It's drawn like that because his face is supposed to be looking to his left. This wasn't a portrait of him from the side.

...I'll have to work on fixing the ambiguity there too.  




 Fuckin' love it. Thanks, man. I'll be using this.  




 Can you go into detail on it? I'm still frustrated with the drawing. It's off in ways, but I've been looking at it for so long I can't tell exactly how.  




 Hahahahahhahahahah 




 Right you are. :)

The way I worded it is slightly off from the original - it was how Jack Nicholson's character quoted it in The Departed, where I was remembering it from.

 




 Thank you!

My portfolio's at [maazcon.com](http://maazcon.com). And then there's an [Instagram](http://instagram.com/maazcon) with the same handle - I update those two the most frequently. I'm still in the process of finishing the layout for the portfolio itself so hopefully it's running smoothly.

More stuff like this will be under the "Artwork" page!
 




 I was about to do that! The reason I didn't was because I wanted to try my own take at it - basically imagining what I'd make the tagline if I was the one in charge of marketing the movie. I do that with most of the posters I make (it's almost like a fun mental exercise).

I'm glad you like it. :) 




 Thanks, man! I really appreciate the kind words. 














 HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT. 




 Thank you ! Those were one of the sources of inspiration. :) 









 *I just do.* 




 Before we look too into any of this, let's remember that the movie's far from being done with post-production. That gate won't look as obviously CGI as it does in this clip by the time they're done with it.

 **T H E  D A R K  P A L E T T E** 









 I'm working on one later on today. I'll send you it as soon as it's done! 














 It didn't have the answers. 




 **BALL SO HARD** 




 SPOILERS, Talib.. 




 You can get it. T-Mobile and ATT share the same iPhone model.  




 Looks to me like they do this sort of thing outside all the time. If they don't want to be recorded, they should be decent neighbors and not disturb other people by making so many scenes.
