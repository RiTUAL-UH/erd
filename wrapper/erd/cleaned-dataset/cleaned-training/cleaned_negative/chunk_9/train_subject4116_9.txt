 Keep them safe. Please ( you are the parent, how you do it is your right, but) at some point make them know that it is never their fault if someone hurts them, and they can come to you right away.

I have entertained thoughts of adoption, since in my mind they are already in the world it would actually be better to be raised where they wouldn't be hurt, but I do not know that I am unselfish enough to be a parent.
