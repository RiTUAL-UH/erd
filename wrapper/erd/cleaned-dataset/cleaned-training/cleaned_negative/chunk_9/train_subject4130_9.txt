 343 propaganda.

I'm sure it's so they can push their evil halo killing agenda on you through an app you don't even have to download. 




 Literally all friendly AI turns to God mode Dubbo's with scarab guns. 




 Even though i hate Jeb. I really don't trust anything from salon. They're the people that said burning cars and private property is a legitimate political strategy. They are the most unabashedly large liberal site I know. 




 He's more than a legend... He's a...


*myth* 




 I'm going to assume it was posted because this kid was a fan of halo who was apart of a halo community and thus posted it a halo sub 




 Good art. But I don't think that's how he'd look. 




 Never dyed!? Coulda fooled me damn I thought you had it blonde in one and red in the other, but after a second glance it was the lighting. Alright, I gotta ask. Who the fuck is Felipe?  




 Anytime. Honestly I rarely comment on these at all. You have no reason to have low confidence. Just diet at a surplus, hit the gym, and then jaws hit the floor. You have great style too. You a natural redhead? 




 I'm not sure how to go about it. But it'll take a few discussions with the users and mods on this and other subs to come up with a gameplan to raise awareness. Movements are like a snowball; starts slow and small but if you keep pushing it, it grows and grows, then you don't have to push it anymore, and it gets faster and bigger as it rolls.  




 Jesus Christ your probably the most gorgeous person I've seen on here. I don't say that often, and I never thought I would. You seem like a goddamn barbie doll. If you put on more weight you'd be a solid 11/10.

Damn. So on a scale of 1-10, you're a 9 and I'm the 1 you need...  




 It's even an MS product. Shame really 




 As far as I'm aware, most of Bernie's support and notice came from Reddit being rabid about socialism. We need to do the same, and coordinate. 3k dedicated people is enough to get the same support for Rand. Only Rand has a legitimate chance at getting the nomination AND the presidency. We just need to gain the rabid internet support and the Facebook Republicans. We have a serious shot.

Coordinating officially with his campaign wouldn't hurt either. People just need a a little Rand spark. I'm willing to help coordinate and come up with a legit game plan, we can dominate social media for Republicans/libertarians similar to what Sanders is doing for liberals. It just depends on the willingness of those here to do it.  




 Well they can do it forever. People might pass through there, but that company is created specifically for halo. 




 Plus, a reliable schedule of weekly content from both the community and 343? Also, mobile forum access would be GOAT. Mobile Beyond Entertainment forum access would be GOATier since they're pretty much the defacto competitive forum.  




 Works great for me on mobile.  




 Works great for me. Honestly it has a great set up, it's responsive, and works really well 




 It's hard to think this is the guy I saw on Sadik's Instagram today. His arms got so small with age
 




 Socialism and marxist ideologies. 




 I just got them. You can workout normally, eating is the issue. And for me it's only because out hurts.  




 I had the same thing happen. I strained my tricep doing skullcrushers, stopped working tri's but kept working everything else. Pain kind of went away but not fully.  




 It's nice to see halo reach around here 




 Thank Mr skeltal 




 I want a sexy calander 




 That's a horrible comparison. Absolute trash. Just because the scenario isn't a starving child doesn't mean we can't feel bad for someone who has worked so hard on something for his idols to literally disapprove. 

What you're saying is just a stupid reason to dismiss what someone is going through. "Oh you lost a family member? There's starving kids in Africa, you shouldn't be sad". Or if a rich parent won't give approval or love to his son, "there's people worse off, get over it." Emotions are emotions and problems are problems. Just because someone somewhere is in a worse situation doesn't invalidate any other emotions.  









 Which is a good thing. There needs to be a check on what is usually unchecked. Directly by the people. 

This won't turn into the Tea Party challenging taxes every day because they simply won't have a case. But it will prevent the IRS and political leaders from abusing the IRS and targeting specific groups. 




 You realize what the northern army did right? They raped, pillaged, and destroyed the south, specifically on Sherman's March. The Union Army was in no way as "heroic" as the confederates other than the fact Lincoln freed slaves to weaken the south. 

Lee was an admirable man if you read up on him.  




 What's the difference between /r/communism and/r/FULLCOMMUNISM? 

no this isn't the setup to a bad joke. I'm curious. 




 Wtf does butterface even mean? Your fine. Like real fine 




 Lol. What? Capitalism has been around longer then communism, and outlasted communism in nearly every sense. Even China had to adopt capitalist ways to get where it's at economically. There is no sound argument for communism, please leave. 




 Chicago has the tightest gun laws in the US. His point is ridiculous.  




 In the first pic you look depressed, annoyed, and negative. No one wants to be around someone who won't give them good emotions, at the end of the day that's what interactions are about; making people feel good emotions and "vibes" about you. That pic screams "I'm a drag and no fun to be around" and has a salty vibe. It simply doesn't put good emotions into those who see it. Plus it's just a horrible selfie with bad lighting. T

he next one is generic with no personality whatsoever, and the other one makes you look feminine and desperate for attention. 

My advice: 

- smile or add personality without it. 

- get a buddy to take your pic in better lighting. Preferably when doing something fun that demonstrates high value where you can get a good face shot

- have a pic of you and your buds at the club, with some personality.

- spice up your bio with something a little less generic. Like it was said before, everyone is on Tinder to have fun. So put some legitimate things about yourself and a witty remark that will make you stand out from the thousands of other guys these girls see. They have more options than you do and are more selective. 

- maybe another more masculine pic with your pet. 

- just stand out, be fun and exciting. 




 To clarify, the first pic compared to last pic is your progress? And what weight did you start at? Plus, what are your goals?

If so, and your goal of to get big and cut, yes, it's bad progress. Really bad. You may have defined out a bit, but you need to get significantly bigger so bulking is a must. It seems you don't have the diet in order at all. You need to eat at a large caloric surplus to gain weight and it doesn't look like you have been doing that. Simply just working out doesn't cut it, diet is just as vital as training. So I think you just need to her serious about your diet. 




 Do some lifting and get toned. Looking great 




 That really isn't a lot of progress for 3 years. You need to do a relatively clean bulk, and get on a lifting program. You should be about 190-200 by now  




 PEWPEWPEWBWAPBWAPBWAP.

MURICA 




 Fucking commie 




 John Wayne makes that pic. But still needs more Reagan. 




 Greatest sci Fi universe ever. 




 This came first 




 This happened first. 




 Sick shit bro 




 To be fair, *nothing* stops the Chief when he wants to do something.  




 Montages, machinima, map features and reviews. 




 That was gold 




 ***SURRENDERTHATAI!!*** 




 Pics. Let's see that physique. 




 /r/dadbod 




 It's an everyone wins mentality we put in by giving everyone a trophy
 









 Comments salty as shit. Damn. 




 Damn. That's awesome, we have identical builds. Also very similar to my goals, I started a month ago, currently at 157, hope to be 220 in 3 years. How was your diet/training? 




 I use bodyspace. Calculates everything, keeps track of workouts, and whatever program your on. 




 Hamplanet to hottie. Niccceeee 




 For a lot of those men it wasn't about slavery, it was about fighting for their home and state. This mentality extended up to General Lee. Many felt they had no choice.  




 But HEY! At least you didn't have to own land to vote! 




 He expanded the electorate substantially for the time 




 Both. This is pretty interesting. 




 Whoa. Do you have a sause? 




 Full what he said

 Oh, yeah. Thats like getting hate mail from(Adolf) Hitler. Theyre literally terrible human beings. Ive read their newsletter, Ive visited their website, and theyre just rotten to the core. For an organization that prides itself on Christian values  I mean, Im an atheist, so what do I know?  they spend their entire day hating people. They can all suck my dick as far as Im concerned." 




 It won't. That was a cold blooded attack on innocents by people that despise us. Not a war between uniformed brothers that understood each other.  




 Lee wasn't even a slave owner. He didn't agree with slavery either, the only reason he fought for the CSA was because his loyalties were to his state and way of life over his nation. This was the case with the overwhelming majority of CSA soldiers who were only in the war to fight for their home and from foreign aggressors. My biggest fear with all of this is that we will begin to condemn the soldiers and their memorials along with the flag.  




 He isn't a good president. Neither was Bush, or Clinton. 




 Jackson has a pretty good rep and did a wonderful job. The only stain and huge wrongdoing being the Indian thing  




 You can do that all you want. But until you can come up with logical reasoning, it means nothing. He is a frontrunner in key states whether fox wants to acknowledge it or not. 




 Unions between people have always been a thing. But *marriage* has not, like I've said before **semantics**. His economic policies will work and I'm glad he'll be president. People will vote for him over Hillary if he gets the nomination. Just because someone doesn't want the government regulating marriage doesn't mean they're socially backwards. He's stated he wants the government out of people's lives in every way for a while now  




 He isn't. But I pay close attention to his ideas and what he says. It's a step in the right direction where basically anyone else in the Republican race is a step back. 




 He is a conservative but he isn't for unequal rights for people. But the institution of marriage has been around since before our government and has been a religious thing. It's *semantics*, marriage has been between a man and a woman and first defined that way by religion, the government just gave them benefits and prevented gays from having the same ones (bad). Paul just says gays should have the same rights, but it shouldn't be called marriage because that word implies sanction by god. Which gays *may* not have.

All in all, he wants the government totally out of it unless enforcement of the contracts so this issue wouldn't even be relevant. 




 It is a massive oversimplification of the last century. But in short, we've never had true free markets, there have always been a large element of government favoritism. 

The idea that it was hands off economics that led to the depression is a huge myth.  




 Because they are equal rights. Marriage isn't a right defined in the constitution. It isn't a right to be regulated, registered, and defined by the government. It *was* a religious institution before it was a government one, and it was around before our government decided to regulate it. This is his point, he doesn't want to spite anybody. Paul has held you'd position for awhile now, you honestly think a libertarianesq like him wants to have his life regulated and registered by the government? Fuck no

Like I said before, he wanted to be married. The only way to do that was to actually get married. He's advocating for most of the benefits instead of taxes to be covered in a legal contract between two people without state intervention unless it's time for it to be enforced or annulled.

What you're essentially saying is equivalent to saying people can't support civil rights because they're white, or more accurately, proper immigration reform because they live comfortably in the US.  




 Because people that had ran our country were deeply religious. I'm not trying to justify those laws, rather argue for them to be removed entirely and replaced with legal contacts. 

Religious people want the right to the word *marriage* and LGBT want equal benefit from the government in regard to the act of marriage. There's no reason one can't be called marriage and the other a civil union. You could argue that it's "separate but equal" but it's really not, it's legal semantics and that's it. And like it or not, marriage is a religious institution that's been around for millennia and has been defined as between a man and a woman.  




 They can be involved in the same way you'd enforce any other contract between two consenting adults, you don't need overarching regulations for that. A contract is basically a set of obligations and terms between parties enforced by the government, and marriage is better off that way.  




 You would have those things related to children, finances, death, and property covered in a contract without government interference. The only time the government would get involved is when the contact needs to be enforced or annulled.   




 I'm a libertarian so I vehemently disagree with his economic positions so my vote goes to Rand. But I respect his integrity if that counts for anything. 




 That's not true at all. One can get married and enjoy the benefits and advocate for change. Why? Because the change he advocates for affects his marriage and would make the institution itself far better off. You can't blame him for taking advantage of the only way to get married, like literally everyone else. The  government doesn't need to be involved in everything. 

Your logic relies on the idea that he would want these benefits from the government at the time he got married even though he received them. He wanted to be married and committed to someone he loves, not the benefits that entails. We know this is true because his position has been constant and he's willing to make a change that affects his marriage here and now. He still says this at risk of losing christian GOP votes that he will need for the primary. 




 That is ridiculous. So straight married people aren't allowed to support equal rights to people? That is so stupid 




 Neo-Cons mainly. 




 Humans. You just never know.  




 Except the Libertarian party or Sanders 




 So he was canned for good reason. I mean what the above article said made him seem like a straight asshole. 




 SIR. 

SIR Ian McKellen

Fucking casual. 




 Famous words of Hillary Clinton. 




 This is the type of guy that gives Republicans a bad name 




 Yeah, the II's have the XP. But I think physically they are on par 




 It'd be a toss up in a 1v1 equal everything 




 Okay. I need pics of your body, 220 lbs muscle puts you at absolutely ripped. Cover the tattoo, but please post before and after 




 Can we get the story behind this? 




 A. taking a picture of your nude underaged children.

Also, I really wish people would stop taking nude pictures of their kids..

I ran around nude in a cowboy outfit and rode a tricycle nude when I was about 3. My mom took a picture because I was being a funny and adorable toddler, I wasn't being sexualized, i turned out fine, and ended up with a funny picture. Stop demonizing a normal part of childhood. 
 




 Seriously. Did you listen to hunt the truth? The ending had me surprised as fuck, they totally played Ben  




 You and Pepsi should team up and do am AMA 




 You seem like some reddit god. What the shit is up with you.  




 Check out all of the Halo books. Fall of Reach and everything that follows is pretty phenomenal. 




 The forerunners. Blinded and corrupted by a millennia of absolute power, yet so majestic and wise at the same time. The universe has real world allusions to things like NSA spying. I will never stop being entertained by that lore and universe. 




 That is NICE. Do you do a muscle group split? I'm mirin your back. 




 Pics or didn't happen 




 Wasn't expecting that. Yeah I'd smash 




 Don't you just love when SJWs become so SJW that become racist bigots. It's like a circle, circle of Justice. 




 Halo all the way. It's incredibly rich and lucrative, with deep lore. It will always be my first love. Second will be Doctor Who. 




 This is dope. If I had money, I'd buy a copy. You're a great artist. 




 What's Johns last name? Or do glassed planets have bad records? 




 Please be halo centric in many ways. I can't even imagine RT OE RvB without Halo undertones.  




 I'd like to join as a libertarian. 




 Lol 




 /u/govschwarzenegger 




 You're probably right honestly. I just wanted to see what others have dealt with having been at it longer 




 IMO Calum is a modern day Arnold. So he is better, but Sadik still looks great 




 Feels
