 My older brother passed away a couple of nights ago. We found these notes on an open text document on his laptop. For the record, no one in my family knew about Sylvia. As of right now, were conducting a search to find out more about her. Here are the notes. 

Sylvi-

I dont think I could adequately express my feelings for you if I tried. Ever since I saw those crystal blue eyes beneath wavy golden locks, I knew you were destined to be mine. I guess I should apologize in advance for not being the person you and I both wish I was. I want to give you the world, and treat you like a queen, and I suppose all I can say is that Ill sincerely try. Syl, youve given me a chance. And that chance is the most wonderful thing thats ever been given to me. I look at you, and I look at me, and I question why youd ever be with someone like me. Im a mess, Im a ruin, and youre Youre everything. Youre beautiful, and kind, and smart, and ambitious, and youre going places. I dont know if Ill ever show you this letter, but I want you to know that at this moment, I am the happiest Ive ever been. Sylvi, youve made me the luckiest guy on the planet. Youve given me more than I ever could have asked for, Vi. And I promise you, sincerely, I will do all I can to never let you down. Forever and more. 

Sylvi-

I am so in love with you, Sylvi. A couple weeks, and Syl, youre my everything. Youve made me feel a way Ive never felt before in my life, and I dont anticipate ever feeling this wonderful again. Youre like a high that never goes away. Just thinking about you makes me euphoric, Vi, because youre mine. Youre what Ive always wanted but never dared to dream of. Sometimes Im afraid to sleep because Im worried Ill wake up and realize that everything that happened between us wasnt real. I am so grateful for you, and Im so grateful for us. I love you, Sylviana Jane. Forever and more. 

Sylvi-

Im sorry, Vi. Im so, so sorry. I worried that I would screw things up between us, and I did. I didnt mean to make you cry, Sylvi. I didnt mean to make you feel any less than wonderful. Im sorry I yelled at you. Im sorry about the busted lip. I just, I went off, Vi, and It wasnt your fault. I know you wont answer my calls, and you wont answer my texts, but Sylvi, Im begging you, please forgive me. I know I dont deserve it, and I know I dont deserve you, but Im asking you with everything I have to take me back. I promise you Ill never hurt you again. I still love you, Sylvia Jane. Forever and more. 

Sylvi-

Why wont you answer my calls? My texts? Its been 24 hours, Syl, and Im starting to get worried. I dont know where you are, Syl, and it terrifies me. I drove around last night looking for you for I dont know how long. Where the hell did you go? Syl, Im begging you, please, please come back. Ill never ever hurt you, or yell, or any of that ever again. If I dont see you soon, Syl, Im leaving and Ill find you. Ill find you, Syl, you better believe it. Theres no hiding from me, I love you, and I will find you. Forever and more. 

Sylvi-

I cant sleep. Its been 28  hours. I cant do this anymore. Im leaving. Ill find you, Syl, and Ill take you right back where you need to be, with me. I will not stop searching until youre back with me. Forever and more. 

Sylvi-

Even with your eyes shut, Syl, youre so beautiful. Even with the puffy purple lower lip. Even with the swollen eye socket and blood-matted hair. Even lying on a bloodied, dingy carpet amidst glass shards and powdered cyanide. I found you, Syl, and it was too late. You were gone. Youve been gone for hours, Syl. Your pretty eyes are shut for good, never to be reopened. I said Id find you, Syl, and I did. I found you, and I took you home. And youre here, with me. Were together now, just like I had always imagined. On the way back from where I found you, I stopped at a drugstore, and I bought two things. One, the biggest bottle of Tylenol I could find, and two, the most expensive music speaker. $119.47, Sylvi. Nearly maxed out my bank account. 100 pills in the bottle. Ive taken all 100. The first 20 went down easy, but the last were harder. They started tasting bitter after a while, but now I can feel them settling in my stomach. Ive had to fight my gag reflex, but its working. I can feel my perception starting to slip.  And now were both here. Nobody's home. Its quiet and dark. In a couple of minutes, Im going to play that song that always made me think of you as loud as I can, and Im going to lay down next to you, and Im going to join you. Wherever you went, Sylvi, Im coming. Im never losing you again. Ill find you in that vast nothingness. Ill follow you, just like in the beginning. Im coming. And then, we can really be together. Forever, Sylvi. Forever and m
