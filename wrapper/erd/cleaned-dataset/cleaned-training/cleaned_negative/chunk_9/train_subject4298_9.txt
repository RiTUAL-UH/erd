 But they would still get stuck, regardless whether they consult the subreddit or a walkthrough. 

Your suggestion doesn't offer a solution to the problem you've posed 




 can't people buy the same hat though?

I'm not an expert, but I bet it's mass-produced 




 link? 




 Oversized Anal Beads 




 In an interview Brian did for Starbomb he said that Arin and Dan both wrote the songs, but Dan did the final draft of the lyrics. 




 But if you know exactly where they get stuck in advance, then it isn't a seamless entertainment experience

It's also not a big deal if they look up a walkthrough. 




 also all the spots in the game that they'll be stuck on 




 There has been a terrible crash in outer space... 




 Hey, my name's Tim... So uh... I have three cats... 




 I thought they were going to trade off every 2 or 3 episodes.

Or did I imagine that? 




 short. more than 15 or so and it gets lame.

Though Sonic 3 has been good consistently throughout the whole thing 




 I was on the computer last night, Googling myself 




 I'm reading a book on abortion! It's called "What to Expect when you're *Expecting* to **Un**-expect the expected" 




 Hey baby... ever *fuck* a superhero? 




 if they're going to say something to any random person that asks them, then they'd just say it to everyone 




 yeah, sorry, there needs to be evidence first 




 Houston! We're going down! May-Day! May-Day! We're heading straight for a residential area! 




 Are you guys ready for starvation and joblessness? 




 You haven't unlocked it yet. Advance further in the story and get a higher score 




 They're mainly referring to the production costs. It takes a hell of a lot more time, effort, and money to make something like this than it does to make a Let's Play and even with all that time it takes, you're still putting out **less** content than the Let's Play 




 Yeah, this sounds nothing like the version I have. You can barely hear Arin and Dan's even worse 




 One of the top ones is like "dude, what have you become...." or something along those lines 




 It's illegal to sing a copyrighted song on anything (movies, shows, internet videos, your own musical cover, ANYTHING) that you haven't payed a Mechanical License for. While it's highly unlikely that anyone would go after them for singing these, if they just happened to come across and flag it, just because they felt like it, the video would either get removed or all of the revenue would go toward the copyright holder.  If this happens 3 times, the channel gets shut down. 

Why jeopardize your business over that? 




 I dunno, it just got less and less funny. Suzy was genuinely the funniest for once but then she left for the last two. I felt there were some storylines that should've been edited down, if not out completely, like when they were hunting Arin/Barry, they didn't need to leave in the "phased" part, they could've just cut to them being found. Little things like that, but mostly, it wasn't as funny as it went on 




 Okay.... *now* what? 




 Did ya hear what happened to Jared? He had a freak accident! He said he wanted to go tanning before summer started... 




 that'd be funny in a sketch or something if they always look like shit, like lipstick smeared all over the damn place. 




 What the OP complains about during sex.  




 To do list:

Pick up the dry cleaning, swing by Dad's for a bit, get some groceries (no eggs this time) Kill yourself... 




 Kevin sleeps at the foot of Arin's bed. Like a cat 




 It got worse as it went on, but I enjoyed each episode 




 Something's wrong with youtube. I had several hundred views on a [video I just uploaded yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv45pHtzCcU) and now it's at like 60.

My friend contacted me, saying this happened to him as well

Edit: They're back now 




 no, it's a George Harrison video. It says it in the title. 




 Grump Craft 




 in other news, this guy is entirely wrong about it being a shitty reality show 




 the point is, they are doing an 8 to 5 job (or longer) doing the not-so-fun side of running a successful youtube channel. They don't just have fun, upload the video, then sit back and collect money. It's a challenging business endeavor 




 I know what you're thinking... did he give me 37 french fries.... or 34? Well, with all these customers, I forgot myself... but you gotta ask yourself *one* question... do you feel, **hungry?**  ...PUNK! 




 This week on Friends: Chandler gets a sex-change operation! And the rest of the gang finds out that each of them has contracted an STD! Tune in for all the *wacky* adventures! 




 It's all the business stuff during the week that he had to do that probably got to him. Plus all the work put into his own channel, not just making the videos, but the business side on that channel as well. It's definitely overwhelming and leaves you emotionally drained.. 




 I thought it was going to be Jon 




 I'll never understand why people expect a normal Lets Play from game grumps, but whatever. People are just stupid i guess 




 Yes definitely! Hell, it doesn't even have to be an animator, it could be anyone! Just sit down and talk over footage of someone creating something 




 She legitimately didn't care, so to her it wasn't about playing the game, like it has been with her in the past.

Suzy's definitely the funniest in Guild Grumps so far :D 




 This is really creepy.

also, who cares about this and why has there been "some confusion?" 




 Yea 




 bro, spoilers! 




 it's amazing just how many people have completely missed the point of guild grumps 




 good thing they're not using face cams then!

 My guess is since this was filmed in November, this was around the time they were working like mad to get the second Starbomb album out in December 




 Yeah, different games with complex challenges would be cool with this style. Maybe if they did Minecraft [the way Node did it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUNF3_hO_no) 




 I don't know anything about WoW lore, but I'm sure there's more to it than that small amount of time Ross spent on it 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_II_%28film%29 




 meh, not as funny without witnessing their attempts to understand it. Like Arin's outburst about "that's not even from the game we're gonna play!?"

Or Suzy's interview, where she just looks defeated, but still trying to explain it 




 ok? Mine too 




  But the first 5 minutes was Ross explaining the lore. And that's fine and all, but I really don't think anyone wants to hear about the lore (prove me wrong!

That was the point. He wanted to torture them (especially Arin, who hates plot) 




 It's being WAY overblown. It's no more cruel than just messing with your friends for fun. Even Ross is laughing the whole time about the whole debacle. The point is: Comedy

 It's kind of like looking for a needle in a stack full of haystacks.... on the moon... with a telescope...

There's also other factors that impede finding life, like; they aren't technologically advanced enough to communicate, the distance between us makes it impossible to communicate possibly taking like 50 years to deliver a single message, we aren't listening for the right signals (what if they use something entirely different than radio signals)  maybe they aren't contacting us on purpose, or maybe we're just not pointing our devices at the right places

 I hate the argument about Sonic that "you're running so fast you can't possibly see an enemy coming, so you just get hit!"

That same argument can be applied to any 2D sidescroller. Plus, Sonic isn't about going fast all the time, and when it actually is, they're not gonna put much in the way that is unable to dodge. (can't really say that about the modern games, though) 




 You're taking issue with someone offering a different opinion... and people like you complain when the main sub does exactly what you're doing.

I'M taking issue with someone who wholly missed the point of the show. 




 Not at all. Are you fucking stupid? I was merely explaining that people are going to disagree with criticism and that you shouldn't complain when it gets downvoted 




 I played WoW for 30 minutes and felt exactly the same as Arin/Barry. It was NOT fun and the only bit of joy I could scrape from it was messing around with my other friend who, in turn, was not having fun.

The point isn't "let's teach these guys how to have fun with WoW"

The point **is** "let's make these guys play WoW even though they don't want to." 

It was extremely funny to watch them scrape some fun out of this experience that they wanted no part in, that someone worked hard on preparing. There were several moments where I laughed my ass off, the one coming to my head right now is when it cuts to Ross in the interview room, with his head in his hands, not even saying anything, then cutting straight back to the action.

In the end, the entirety of the Game Grumps channel amounts to turning on the recording devices and spouting funny dialogue or waiting for something funny to happen in-game. It's a fucking **comedy** show

  The Grumps have an established fanbase now. They'll watch anything the Grumps put out

Or perhaps there are people who genuinely enjoy this, despite the fact *you* didn't. There is no need to insult people for their tastes and demean something you personally didn't enjoy. 




 They are comedians joking around. Noone was mean to Ross and Ross was playing up his despair for laughs. This is not meant to be taken seriously in any way, even Ross's work put into crafting the whole thing 




 Ross already lost it. Arin made sure of that 




 No it's not scripted. That would be so much extra work and ultimately wouldn't be any funnier than if they improvised. 

Plus it just defeats the purpose of the "reality show" angle
