 I've yet to sell anything and I'm buying a bit of everything (from generic to semi-numi) so when I do sell, I can see what various items fetch.  For example, will a tube of American Silver Eagles have been a better buy than a tube of generic Buffaloes? Do I get spot on a 10oz Geiger as well as a 10oz OPM? Could be I should have doubled down on the OPM bars, won't know until I try to sell.

Keep good records of what you're paying for whatever you're buying.  Reference that when you sell, that can drive future purchases. 




 I only have one that I've unwrapped.  When I'm done rubbing it across my nipples, I use Saran Wrap to wrap it back up until the next Friday evening. 




 * Gindaloon Coin Shop off exit 14
* Fugazi's Rare Coins and Waste Management in Union City
* Frankie Four Fingers Gold and Silver
* Fookin Mullion Jewelers 



















 The Buff is right up my alley, but I'm holding out on buying. I'm waiting to see if we test the lower $1100s and and hit $14 silver like we did back in November of last year.

Item #s:

* 141557285146 (Buffalo)
* 141528111687 (ASE)

A bookmark of their store "special price" store search results page is worth your while, too. 




 You're pretty much paying $30 for a wood box, IMO. 









 I can tell you from experience don't try this in your microwave.  Skip the clean setting on your oven, too. 




 Just a public notice here, if you're someone who doesn't drive much, checkout [MetroMile](https://www.metromile.com/) for car insurance.  My insurance went from $90/month to around $26. I don't drive much, though.

Been with them for around a year, I guess.

I've not had to go through any claim process with them, but then my record is pretty impeccable (one minor incident in literally 27 years).

Highly recommend them if you're not a big driver. 




 It's a lot of work to just potentially get to the first step of an interview process.

Of course they're targeting "passionate" developers who don't mind working for free.  I don't even want to work 8 hours a day as there are things I'd much rather be doing with my life than building/maintaining shit that doesn't really matter other than facilitating business. 




 Nothing seems to ever go right for him

I don't see how you can say that. What do you know about the guy?  He's had the recent bad APMEX/USPS stolen and now a USPS misdelivering to a PO Box.  He has a lot of videos up so it seems a lot has gone right for him.

I found him via his APMEX story and I'm glad I did. He's bringing to light and reenforcing what we should all be cognizant of when buying/selling non-locally.

I felt for him in regards to the APMEX scenario.  The latest issue I don't feel so bad for him, though, as I outlined his two mistakes (at least IMO) in my OP up top.  I still think hjis experience is worth sharing here. I'm surprised so many seem to be brushing it off as he's just a whiny bitch.

I'm curious how you would handle the situations he's had. You wouldn't reach out to the stacking community in some venue? 



















 It's a 6 minute video. 




 LOLing at the soundtrack.

Other than that, looking forward to not buying it and ridiculing those who climb aboard that train.

Mentions he sent two separate packages in a trade deal. Two separate packages because it wouldn't fit in one priority mail package.  This was mistake #1.

Mentions "this was not a cheap trade, I would have been out quite a bit" but he cheaps out and didn't send it registered with proper insurance. This was mistake #2.

No mention of what happened to the 2nd package (at least I didn't seem to catch it).  Seems to have been left with "it's out for delivery" despite it being delivered to the post office (box).

This guy can't catch a break with USPS lately.

**Question for you guys selling over at /r/pmsforsale, how are you shipping? What are you doing re: insurance?**

 It isn't your problem. I know, I know, you don't want to be a jerk and you want to help them! That's not your job, which is over. Let management manage the business/risk. 




 How come Macchio didn't do the electric classical thing to beat Jack Butler. 




 Had an account since 2008, I'm on my 3rd employer since then, not one of them looked at it during the hiring process (I asked).

I've had three or four phone screens with other companies during that time, but I never asked them if they looked at my github, I only ask at the end of in-person interviews.  I don't interview in-person a whole lot, though, I'm somewhat selective, meaning I don't go on in-persons just because they've asked me in.

From my (limited) experience, it doesn't matter at all.  I'm not target the startup world, though, so that might make a difference. 




 Question/Complaint: Whats with all the single-car trains?

Let me answer your question with a question:

Would you prefer no train at all?

Thats basically what it comes down to when your train shows up and theres only one car instead of two. At least *something* showed up.

I can *personally* respect and appreciate their "hey, fuck you" blunt response, but their PR could use a little polishing for the masses. 




 But then wouldn't every train be a single car during the heat?  




 Blue lines, morning and eve.

 Is this a new thing? I'm seeing more of it lately and I don't recall this in years past.

 Wow, great sale, damn shame I missed that one. Congrats on that score. 




 What were the flash prices at?  I recently picked up a couple 5oz Horses from Bay Precious Metals @ $108. I would probably have picked up a kilo but missed the apmex sale. 




 They have 5oz as well.

* Banks will remain shut until at least after a July 5 referendum
* Reuters is also reporting that the Greek stock market will not open on Monday

What impact do you guys think this will have on PM prices this coming week? 




 Bay Precious Metals on ebay has Perth Mint 1/4 oz Year of Horse and Goat at $338.70. I think those are the better buy.  They also had the Snake (I grabbed a couple) but that is no longer on their listing so looks like they sold that one out. 




 But does he like dags? 




 How about TAHO? Bought some RIOM (Rio Alto) last year which is now Tahoe Resources. 




 Also, we did have an intro webinar today, a few people joined but we had internet issues.

[APMEX "special price" ebay store page](http://stores.ebay.com/APMEX/_i.html?_nkw=special+price) is worth a bookmark on your end.

 




 IMO, they're essentially treating some of their inventory as loss leaders, buying feedback if you will, trying to get that power seller status so people keep coming back, new people come in with confidence they won't get hosed.  I would imagine they'll be raising prices in the future.  Not all of their inventory is a deal, as well...They have a kilo Koala for $598, both APMEX and Provident are around $30 cheaper, I think it was when I compared.

I've had a good purchase through them, though their shipping is slow if you're on the west coast.  Didn't get tracking until the 3rd biz day after the buy-it-now.  UPS Ground is 5 days coast-to-coast, so 8 day shipping for me. 




 You may want to take a look at http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ It provides scripts to detect mobile browsers in several languages. 

One thing to note on their about page is:

*Android tablets, iPads, Kindle Fires and PlayBooks are not detected by design. To add support for tablets, add |android|ipad|playbook|silk to the first regex.*

Odd that they don't just add that themselves. 




 Bay Precious Metals on ebay has the 5oz Horse and Goat for $110.  I picked up a couple of the Horses, will get a couple of the Goats as well, perhaps this weekend depending on if there are other deals out there.

Just for some mintage comparisons in Series 2:

* 5oz Mouse 3,005
* 5oz Ox 4,720
* 5oz Tiger 14,553
* 5oz Rabbit 8,030
* 5oz Dragon 31,664
* 5oz Snake 20,552
* 5oz Horse 31,232
* 5oz Goat 12,426

 




 It's item # 331552798850 




 Don't even notice it on my screen. 




 That picture definitely looks photoshopped to me.  I've seen quite a few in my day. 














 When do you think the webinar will be posted after-the-fact?  Will it be something I'll be able to watch over the weekend? 














 Sounds like a cattle rustler to me.  One thing is for sure, when Ohio Bill comes into town, you better skin out before he skins that smoke wagon and you see what happens. 




 I can't argue with that. 









 This is a great watch, very interesting and very well presented and explained.  code starts around 24:30.

If you're writing SPAs, it's worth your time. 




 That seems to be *somewhat* of a standard deal for them, I see them offer that fairly regularly (same with 1oz bars at $20 over).

I wish they'd get current year AGEs or Buffaloes for that. Those seem to go on their "special" less frequently around $35 over. 




 I'd go for the gold CML.  Or maybe a tractor.

This isn't asking about research/better quality of life, yada yada yada, that kind of stuff...What has actually been solved by philanthropy? 














 In for a tube of goat privys. 









 Yes, exactly. It shows they really keep up with the javascript space, which is always good, IMO.

You can also write in ES6 and transpile it down to support older browsers. 




 Extended the offer but they went elsewhere.  I can't blame them, they went to a big marquee name on your resume type of employer.

 Everyone with eyeballs thinks they can do your job 

It garners no respect from anyone

JavaScript is a joke to most programmers

Completely disagree with these. 




 It's Java.  

ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced classes to JavaScript (ECMAScript is JavaScript if you're not aware). The caveat being ES6 classes are syntactical sugar over the objects and prototypes devs are used to when working with "classes" in JavaScript.

Here's an example of an ES6 class (not a function in sight):

    class View {
        constructor(options) {
            this.model = options.model;
            this.template = options.template;
        }

        render() {
            return _.template(this.template, this.model.toObject());
        }
    }

We're interviewing front-end devs where I work and over the past month we've probably done phone screens with 10 candidates. Only one could talk about ES6, the others couldn't tell me one thing about what's new in ES6. 




 50% correct.  Now, which sentence of yours is "incorrect" and can you add a caveat to it? 




   "gold maple leaf" in Coins shows 393 in bullion and 245 in Coins:Canada. The top link in Coins:Canada is APMEX for $1253.

I believe it shows up down by the paypal logo under shipping/delivery at the top of the listing. Is anyone seeing the ebay bucks logo on this listing?  I'm signed up, but I've never seen the logo, though I'm not a big ebayer.

 I've only seen the lights in Alaska, amazing shot. 




 Personally, I don't do these. If they can't get a gauge of my skillset to make a decision based on a phone screen, possibly multiple in-persons, reviewing my github, fuck them.

These skill tests are a great way to waste a candidate's time with no time wasted on the employer's side. 




 Am I jelly? Maybe a little. 




 I would super glue the tarnished sides together, that way you get a 2 oz ASE with proper obverse and reverse.

I make the big bucks because I focus on solutions, not problems. 




 if not, we will be testing $15 and possibly lower.

Yes, please.

Most analysts are still calling for $1,150 and lower

Si, por favor.

Tough decision. 




 Because most companies don't care about their employees, nor the professional goals/development of their employees. To them, employees are inventory, dispensable and replaceable. They don't want to pay to develop employees, they want someone else to pay to develop employees.

 Over the past year or so my boss and I have interviewed over a hundred JavaScript developers

Every try to quantify to your pinhead boss how much $ you're wasting with your obviously shitty interview process?

Over the phone he claims that it should only take the candidate about 20 - 30 mins to complete.

Have your boss take it. Where is he coming up with this time frame?

I feel we've lost a lot of potentially great developers due to this

You have. On the bright side, at least you guys are just doing bullshit work all day long since you don't really need another developer. Also, by the time you find a developer who is up to snuff as per your boss, that framework he passed the test in will be deprecated. 




 They also have the [Australian 1oz Platypus for $1.50 less than the Maple](http://www.ebay.com/itm/1oz-Australian-Platinum-Platypus-/331567879565?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item4d32fc558d).  I've been watching both of these via BPM.

 Hey, that's great.  I think it needs more illustration and less cities.  For example, an indian illustration next to Warm Springs, an antelope next to Hart Mountain (there's the National Antelope Refuge right there), Salem could have the capitol building.

 [Here's a direct link to their special price store page](http://stores.ebay.com/APMEX/_i.html?_nkw=special+price), currently just a 1oz gold bar for $1203 ($19 over spot).

I wouldn't worry about this, it was shipped insured so everything would have worked out for you in case you didn't receive it/sign for it. 









 Couple of thoughts, take them for what they are:

* I don't get graded coins from a modern run/mintage of 1,000,000. There is probably a ton of 69s out there (they may not be graded, but you're looking at a large mintage that could make it to the graded market).
* I agree with /u/Cantilivewhileim that a MS70 would be "worth it".
* The crocs are sold out at the mint so dealers are jacking the prices.  [SD Bullion is asking $26 a coin](https://sdbullion.com/silver/perth-mint-coins/2014-australian-saltwater-crocodile-silver-1-oz-bu-perth-mint), for example.  I didn't do any other comparison shopping, I just knew they had them in stock as I was browsing them this past weekend.

If you like it, grab it. 20 looks to be not quite $23 USD so it's a good price, I suppose. I picked up a tube last year, I like them.


 









 Shipping time for me is slow as fuck.  I believe I hit the buy-it-now on June 4th, my tracking shows delivery is today. I didn't get tracking info until 3 biz days after the buy-it-now.

I'm on the west coast, they ship from just outside Boston. 




 how was the coin advertised? Was it advertised as BU, uncirculated?

Exactly.  I have one of these coming today (slow as fuck shipping for me) and I don't recall it being advertised as BU. I'm hoping there are no really visible flaws but I would be fine with your coin.  That's just me, though.

 Casual gamer here, looking for some Steam Summer Sale recommendations.

Skyrim is my favorite game. I'm actually replaying it right now and it's still as beautiful as I remember it. I don't even fast travel. Or take a horse.  Nope, I run the entire map. What I love the most about it is the open world aspect, which makes is not a linear game. It really is an adventure. I also love that you get a lot of game play out of it.

My last game purchase was The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. I picked up the game of the year edition and holy fuck I played that for MONTHS and MONTHS and MONTHS. Really enjoyed that as well, same reasons as Skyrim.

Also played State of Decay which I thought had a lot of potential to be an amazing game but it was just too short.  I still really enjoyed it, though. Good game.

I have some shoot 'em up games, including zombie-types, but I'm looking for more Skyrim'ish type of games to look for on the Steam Summer Sale.  I'll also probably look for a Skyrim expansion pack or something as I think I just have vanilla Skyrim.

Would love some recommendations from you guys with tons more game-play experience.

My PC runs Skyrim with no problems. Video card fans kick on, but no problems with the game play and it loads fast. 




 That is some amazing footage and the stupidity of humans never ceases to amaze me. Incredibly dangerous situation to be filming that.

Be sure to keep your receipt from BGASC so you have the provenance.  THAT will help more than keeping in a sheet.  This, of course, assumes BGASC is still around when you go to sell, or a buyer remembers them if they're not still around.

 [Bay Precious Metals has 1/4oz Gold Australian Lunar Snake for $337 ](http://www.ebay.com/itm/1-4oz-Gold-Australian-Lunar-Snake-/331567879517?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item4d32fc555d). They have other fractional pieces but the snake is the winner, IMO.

 




 The owners will always tell you it's a safety issue (i.e., so other drivers can hear them). Truth is, it's really more Harley Davidson branding and microphallus. 




 It's a good deal for APMEX. 




 What's your plan to sell Rhodium? 




 I use serial bar #s for my luggage combination and ATM pin card. 




 The panda premiums I've seen have always been comparable to an AGE or Buffalo. You're pretty much looking  ~$50. I was really disappointed in the removal of the weight/fineness in 2015. Sadly, I'm done with pandas due to that.

Nice to see them throw a tube of something other than ASEs.

Anyone have other deals? Post 'em up here.
 




 Dates and venues are way too small.

Great band which I'll be seeing later this month :) 




 Sold out.  Lesson here is I guess don't wait an hour for the lunch hour to roll around to place an order. 




 I have one of those, I like it because it's different than most kilo bars. 




 Good prices.  




 Where are you located?  I know the orders ship out of the Boston area and I'm west coast.  They're using UPS Ground which is typically 5 days coast-to-coast but my order didn't even ship out until 3 biz days post-ebay buy-it-now. 




 I have 3 of these, I use them for coasters in different wings of my estate. They're cute. 




 Pretty sure silver.com has done this to me, but not JMB. If you're not aware, they're the same company. 

Fill up your order cart and see what it says for shipping.  I think it tells you the carrier.  You can add/remove stuff to break $ thresholds and see if the shipping carrier changes.

You could also email them. Their rep posts here so maybe he'll see this and respond.  I'd go through a mock order cart first.

 




 I'm still waiting for my order, they've been slow as fuck for me. Tuesday is my latest updated delivery day. 




 Don't walk up to me and fucking ask me to move the button 1px to the right when you see I'm watching a funny cat video on youtube.  Understand that is the highlight of my day and I literally want to kill my co-workers. You will be last.

File an issue so I can prioritize appropriately, i.e., I'll take care of that last.

Please stop sending me linked in requests, the only connection I want to make is an axe to your face. 




 [APMEX's response he mentions at the beginning of his video can be found in his video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skn8oAntUUw).  And [here is a screenshot to find it easier](http://i.imgur.com/FCgeH4N.png).

[This same response was a cut and paste job here by APMEX as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/39h0p9/apmex_launches_new_vault_deals_page_to_save_you/cs3fx7n). And [here's a screenshot of that](http://i.imgur.com/pa0mJDR.jpg). 









  I paid around $1103

Shit, nice. 









 Police should be contacted about this, perhaps they would get a couple cruisers out there and issue a few hundred citations.
