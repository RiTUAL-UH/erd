 and Grey Worm 




 *(for the season)* 




 I don't like this response. You can't make a big deal out of a character's lineage and importance, kill them off, and say something like "But it's a statement on the unpredictability of real life." Especially if you spend several seasons/books building a character up, you cannot leave them almost isolated from the rest of the story and never tie up that loose end. It's not effective storytelling. It's not subverting tropes, because basic functioning storytelling is not a trope, it's a requirement. Every other death serves the story well and meets these requirements. Jon Snow's does not. He's coming back. 




 For me, it's Season 1's "The Moth". Good on first watch, but oh God is it boring on rewatch, and the symbolism is far too on the nose. Great flashbacks, ***awful*** A-story.

 There's a theory that Show Daario is actually Euron Greyjoy. 




 "If that's Jo~~h~~n...then who's in there?" 




 [I really like this interview, where he says that there are things that haven't been revealed yet, that fans have guessed since very early on in the series. He says he doesn't want to change these things, because that would go against his original vision.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQzCPf2NgwE) Because pretty much anything other than R + L = J would be disappointing IMO. 




 The song is **Hide and Seek** by Imogen Heap. **Watcha Say** is the Jason Derulo song that samples it. 




 Under the Dome was written and cast badly. It's not really Bender's fault. Stephen King should stop trying to take a part in writing or producing adaptations of his own work. 




 Don't tell /r/gameofthrones or /r/asoiaf. The **Mads Mikkelsen is free to audition for Euron Greyjoy** Hype Train is at full force, and [this train](http://i.imgur.com/89Ilu0j.jpg) has [no brakes](http://www.tvqc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/euron_greyjoy__by_jazzx89-d5nliyh.png). 




 OK Computer,    
Hail to the Thief,    
In Rainbows,    
Kid A/Amnesiac,    
The Bends,    
Pablo Honey,    
The King of Limbs - for me. 




 as well as every finale. 




 He directed every Desmond episode, minus Jughead. **GET HYPE** 




 This guy directed 33% of LOST's episodes, and many of the best. Walkabout, Flashes Before Your Eyes, The Constant (highly critically acclaimed), The Man from Tallahassee (which won Terry O'Quinn the Emmy for best supporting actor), Outlaws (one of my favourites) as well as every finale. I love this guy. Can't freaking wait. 




 In my first free month of Spotify Premium last year, I tried out several artists' music album by album. They were one of the many artists I tried out on the advice of Rolling Stone's Top 100 albums of the 2000s. I saw Kid A at the top and thought, huh I like Creep, so I'll give them a go.

I started from the beginning of Pablo Honey, browsed Reddit for that 40 minutes on my laptop, and really enjoyed it. Went to bed and listened to the first few songs on The Bends and liked them more. Finished The Bends the next day and felt the same. That night, I listened to OK Computer while going for a walk. For me, Exit Music was when I had my first eargasm. That whole last two minutes, with the entry of the distorted bass, the continued soft singing, and at the end of the next line, the slow crescendo and everything...sent chills down my spine. I continued listening, and the next time that happened was when Fitter Happier transitioned into Electioneering, when the drums kicked in. Fuck, I love that album. By that second time, I knew they would be one of my favourite bands.
 




 The Extended Cut balances that out a tad more, adding the Love Is the Drug burlesque sequence very early on. This movie is pretty much a musical without the music. In taking out the one musical number (which, before any action sequences kick in, gives us the only energetic scene in the burlesque reality level) they unbalanced the first act tone setting completely.  
Edit: tense correction 




 Considering the overperformance of The Watchers on the Wall and The Children, do you think it's on HBO's radar to do another IMAX stint for GoT? I see the problem they'd run into in that you couldn't just do the last *two* episodes in IMAX considering this year's episode 4.09 equivalent was episode 5.08 - freaking **Hardhome**. They'd have to do either the last three, or just 5.08 and 5.09 if they think three episodes would be a bad idea in account of length or theater time occupation.    
What's your opinion? 




 Second Son was a clear cut origin story, and a short one too. If they expanded upon it, I'd probably appreciate Second Son more. 




 How cold and stretchy the vocals are, the baby noises, the mobile-sounding noises, the eerie synth, uneven percussion...stay in my head all day and make me depressed. 




 Michael Giacchino's score for LOST, though? I've heard insanely complicated breakdowns for his scores, especially in Season 6. Have an opinion on it? 




 Recently it was both versions of Morning Bell. I used to think it was boring, but **woah**. That guitar and tempo in the Kid A version. And the atmosphere in the Amnesiac version. 




 FUCK OLLY 




 Not if Cortez is involved. 




 The arpeggios in Street Spirit make it feel at least upbeat. It's the baby's mobile noises and creepy ~~strings~~ synth in Kid A that make me want to die. 




 I skip Kid A simply because it's the most emotionally draining piece of music I've ever heard. Sometimes I replace it with another song, like I Might Be Wrong. 




 The small extra stretch for Amnesiac includes the separate recording of Life in a Glasshouse, the only song not recorded in those original sessions. 




 Better than saying her name is Khaleesi, if I'm honest. 




 *Hello darkness, my old friend...* 




 Nowhere to perform a Chicago Sunroof though. 




 The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is not in any way good. Just...ridiculously bloated. Turns a 110 minute film into a 130 minute film, with almost nothing more to show for it. 




 No, you're right, but ya know...with spoiler tags and stuff. Same exact content, just with more tags. That way, more people can get involved and still avoid spoilers. 




 WHAT IS HYPE MAY NEVER DIE 




 This thread shouldn't have been marked "spoilers all". 




 When they come on shuffle and you don't want to listen to them. When listening straight through an album, I think it's like a gap in continuity, but there's no continuity to shuffle. 




 You've got it!

 If your username had a comma in it, this would be perfect. 




 Try Bodysnatchers, Jigsaw Falling Into Place, There There or Optimistic. Listen to the whole song, because none of these really have a chorus. It's about listening to the different layers of guitars, drums, strings, vocals and letting the atmosphere wash over you. 




 [Radiohead - Life in a Glass House](https://youtu.be/upl_rxmsu6s) 




 They were dead the whole time in the faux alt. universe where "they never crashed". In that universe, the island was underwater and inconsequential. Everything that happened on the island, before they were on the island, after they left, and when they came back, happened in their real lives, before anyone died...which accounts for about 95+% of the show's runtime.  
**tl;dr** they were dead for less than 5% of the entire show. 




 **DON'T READ THE OTHER REPLY TO THIS COMMENT! SPOYLARS! SPOILERS!** 




 I see this all the time and it irritates me. I'm naturally yellow blonde and I have recognisably dark eyebrows. It's not uncommon. 




 ...holy crap, I forgot she was married to Tyrion. 




 Homer Simpson would be my *starting* point. Rust wouldn't even enter the conversation. 




 Maybe it's partly due to the fact that most people won't immediately register what a dude is saying if it's something like "O full of scorpions is my mind." 




 And it is of the majority opinion that they've taken it, dare I say, way too far. 




 [Same!](http://i.imgur.com/lXNw5RH.png) 




 Out of nowhere, as in, the episode completely avoids reminding you. 




 Sorry bout that :( 




 the athiesm    
    
Whaaaaaat? No... 




 Garrett Hedlund was only *considered*. Robert Pattinson was also on that list. 




 Not that Agents of SHIELD was groundbreaking, but god those last two episodes of S1 with Fitz and Simmons being dropped to the bottom of the ocean, were heartbreaking. People think Stannis betrayed them? Remember Ward. Attempting to kill two innocent, reserved, often comic relief scientists all because of an alliance with the man who made him. 




 Fuck, that's like my favourite book of all time and I didn't pick that up! 




 ...starring Jennifer Garner! 




 Book 6 is confirmed t early next year. GRRM said that's his goal - before Season 6 airs. 




 Michael Cera joined the writing staff of Arrested Development after he became a producer. Bryan Cranston directed many episodes of Breaking Bad.    
    
Sure, you're right that often times they don't do anything, but not always. 




 [Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsdLNG3u6I). 




 This, mainly because House House needs to be a thing. 




 I'm pretty sure they're going with a new Lera Lynn song like in the original S2 tease, possibly that song itself. 




 Alternate, clickbaity title: **WB Grovels for Potential Game of Thrones Movie** 




 Season 2 has begun and now they're doing Sex and the City 2. 




 That was a great read. Thanks for reminding me of one of my favourite shows growing up. I always loved the Stranded episode and the Power Hour Fairy Oddparents crossovers.    
I think I'll start borrowing [this reaction image](http://i.imgur.com/PXIuWfT.png) if you don't mind. 




 If I fell on a certain angle, probs, eh. 




 Huh. TIL 




 ...you do know that a hangman's noose is designed to snap your neck on impact, right? 




 I enjoy all of the books a lot and loved where final scenes for each character left them, but holy shit the pencil thing was a pretty major cop out. And the Stephen King meta plot line was pretty cheesy.    
Nonetheless, Drawing of the Three and Wizard and Glass are two of my all time favourite books. 




 *motif    
Sorry; impulse correction. 




 [And now with Joel.](http://www.nowgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/381737.gif) 




 [spoilers](/s "George-Michael finds out Michael knew they had the same girlfriend, and punches his dad in the face, Lucille Austero is missing, presumed dead, it's hinted Michael had a part in it, but Gob roofied him after Michael saw Tony Wonder and found out Gob was gay, so he likely forgot how how things went with Lucille 2. Maeby fucked Perfecto and is now a registered sex offender like her dad, and she also got a fuckton of investors interested in what *she* believed GM's Fakeblock software was - an anti-piracy software, when in fact it's actually a woodblock simulator. He's now basically a fraudster, Lindsay might be running for congress, and George Sr is now a transgender. In the **post-credits scene**, we find out that Tony Wonder roofied himself and forgot that he slept with Gob, Buster is arrested for the murder of Lucille 2, and Ron Howard and Brian Grazer decide to greenlight the Bluth movie based on seeing Buster on the news.") 




 All this poster is missing is some good, old fashioned *"head down, eyes up"*.    
    
...but we should be praising Chris Pine's post-apocalyptic hair product and Margot Robbie's sexy brown hair. 




 *Who'd like a banger in the mouth?* 




 Ultron was fucking terrifying...in the first trailer. What we saw/heard of him in those clips tapped into all of my uncanny valley triggers. The movie itself wrecked all of that when Ultron tried to be funny. You can still characterise an AI by showcasing his hubris and lack of regard for human life. You don't need generic sarcastic hubris. That's Loki's thing...and Tony's...and occasionally Thor's...and Widow's...and Steve's sometimes. 




 Oh, I was aware. I'd heard the name before and the super obscure and perfect reference set me the fuck off! 




 I almost died when the one who slits Cat's throat is called **OnlyUseMeBlade** 




 Cars, or [Ice Age 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/35df7g/ice_age_continental_drift_questions_and/). 




 [Or...](https://youtu.be/seMFBo1qBSs?t=52) 




 *(bleep) (bleeeep) (bleeeeeeep) (bleep) (bleep)* **BUSTER** *(bleep) (bleepbleep) (bleep) (bleeeeeeep) (bleepblebleep)* **HORNY OLD SLUT!** 




 On the thousandth rewatch, I've started to think it's not nearly as good as the best episodes of LOST. Great pilot, great entry point to a series, but not one of the best episodes of the series.    
I can't stand Shannon and Boone. 11 year old me didn't mind Maggie Grace in a miniskirt, but now...ugh [spoilers](/s "I'm glad she died"). 




 I know that Bateman tweeted [this picture](https://twitter.com/batemanjason/status/257467881661550592), hinting that they were shooting on the same day, but still...the scene felt so off. The tracking shots were awful, and in the only shots of them touching each other, either GOB or Michael's face is obscured, making me think doubles were used. Is it possible somebody else *sent* Bateman the picture? I keep rewatching this scene and trying to convince myself they were acting against each other, but I can't. 




 Absolutely. 




 I took years to get through Season 1, and finally rushed through the rest of the series after getting spoiled on 4x02 straight after it came out. I caught up the day 4x04 came out...and I still didn't care that much for the series. I was later prespoiled on how Tyrion's story would end that season by some prick on IGN comments.    
However, I did decide to get into the books over the winter (June-July in southern hemisphere). I only read the first book and a half, but holy shit - **all of that context** (plus the map), make it way easier to follow. The photography direction improves dramatically after Season 1, but having the freedom of imagination really helps to improve the mood and sense of scale that was really badly conveyed (initially).    
I still don't *love* the show, but I find it far more enjoyable with all of that context. 




 Odenkirk looks unrecognisable! 




 I also came here to give that answer. [Here's the same scene in ***exponentially*** **better quality**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgsNjTyGsRk).    
    
My runner-up scene would have to be [the introduction of Christian Shephard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj-Z7UVT-d8). 




 I watched them both for the first time back to back and in my opinion, it was a painfully mediocre action movie. Casino Royale, though, was great. 




 Thanks :) That was much better than the album version IMO. 




 Wait, there's a version of that song that isn't a death march? 




 There are no gay characters in In Bruges. They were probably thinking of Rock'n'Rolla, where Tom Hardy's gay character does seduce a dude as part of a scheme. 




 Yes. There are so many classic episodes of television in this series, and such a wealth of characters who you grow to adore. In regards to the *"the pilot was the best episode"* opinion that usually gets thrown out, I think the pilot has aged the worst in comparison to the rest of the series.    
    
I'd say people should watch it, as it's still an absolutely enjoyable show. The characters (excluding probably Shannon and Boone [light spoilers](/s "who thankfully don't last long anyway")) are still some of the most memorable I've seen on TV. If they don't like the ending, then at least they'll at least have an informed opinion. I love the finale *itself*. Remember - it's not the finale itself but what it *wasn't* that more commonly pissed people off.    
From what I've heard, people hated the ending of Twin Peaks (please correct me if I'm wrong), but that show is still revered. I hope people can cease to be so vitriolic towards the show's weaknesses and start to praise its strengths again. The show didn't murder your family or "waste" 6 years of your life. It's okay to be disappointed. 




 Oh...my...fucking...god...    
And it's so blatant :) 




 Wildling! 




 To be fair, most of the hate for Lost does come from former fanboys who set themselves up for disappointment by analysing the show way too much.    
Then again, Lindelof encouraged it, so it's still his fault. 




 Oh, I agree. The series finale is fucking perfection. The reason some don't like it is because they were never into the characters - that's not me, though. 




 In terms of eerie, [Climbing Up the Walls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbtZyuOMdHI) *was* my first choice for this thread.  
In terms of terrifying, Radiohead's [Kid A](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RwvZSfLUXM) (title track) puts me in a freaky mood for the entire day whenever I listen to it. I hate it. Well-constructed song, but it must have been ghost-written by Hitler and Satan. 




 You see, I like a lot of Season 6 - especially [Happily Ever After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65T-xl24W4E) and [Ab Aeterno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsnHQyhIyJg)...but Widmore and Ilana completely fizzled out, Claire was underused, and there was some pretty blatant filler. However, I still love it because of the flash-sideways, which was such a beautiful tribute to the characters.    
My least favourite is Season 4. Keamy is an average villain, Charlotte is a waste of a character, Jack tries to execute Locke in the premiere (wtf?!), Christian appears all over the place for no reason...which still hasn't been fully explained, and there's also the Tom Friendly/Michael plot hole: how the hell could Friendly get off the island if the hatch implosion disabled the submarine?    
The season finale was also pretty average. 




 Exactly. It's not unusual.
    
...I'll show myself out. 




 Oh, definitely GotG, yeah. Although I do like the one with just Cap and the shield from Cap 1. 




 Which one? The cool one with just a tiny Ant-Man in the centre of a vast white background, or the blue and red FACE DOWN EYES UP CELEBRITIES DO U EVN RECOGNISE DEM BRUH poster? 




 **PREVIOUSLY, ON ARROW** 




 Woah...this was hilariously meta. 




 If you watched the finale in two parts, then you probably missed a lot. Two parts are 43 minutes each, whereas the single part version is between 100 and 105 minutes, depending on your region's framerate. The long version was the version that aired, and was also the one available on home release.    
    
Buying the DVD, finding it on streaming or download (like $4 on iTunes) will grant you that edition. The Lostpedia entry on the finale will probably have more detail on what's missing.
