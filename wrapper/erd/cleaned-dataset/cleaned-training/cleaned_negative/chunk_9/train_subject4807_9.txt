I hope you can keep trying to get your hands on him -- he doesn't stand much of a chance without human intervention. This might require lying on the ground by the shed for a while in the dark (been there, done that) but it's worth the effort in the end. You may also be able to borrow a humane trap from local rescue groups. 




 Don't give him (?) milk -- he can't digest it. And feed him *slowly* -- if he hasn't eaten in several days, [re-feeding syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refeeding_syndrome) is a danger.

[Here's a guide](http://www.kittenrescue.org/index.php/cat-care/kitten-care-handbook/) to raising orphaned kittens. Do be sure to take him to a vet as soon as you can afford it to make sure he doesn't have intestinal parasites or other diseases.

 Wrong again. What a surprise. 




 Adding, [here's a map](https://medium.com/hatewatch-blog/mapping-hate-dc06a3822ad) of where "everybody" is freaking out. 




  So anyone that thinks the flag is racist is instantly better educated than those that don't?

Yes, [that's what I said](http://theweek.com/articles/562004/surprisingly-uncomplicated-racist-history-confederate-flag), and [that's what I meant](http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2015/04/_the_confederate_flag_represents_treason.html). Note that all polling figures are from *before* the current controversy; current opinion is even more one-sided. 




 It wasn't necessary to be shopping for western wear to see that emblem all over that extremely visible prime shopping location -- it required only being moderately observant.

And I've met a *lot* of people who frequent this sub, all of them white. I'm aware of a couple of local redditors who are not, but -- seriously -- have you looked at photos of the Columbus Global reddit met-up over the years? Anyway, the assessment was based on what they just said here, not some baseless supposition. 




 I assumed that as soon as I saw the claim came from Pamela Geller. 




 It's implicit in every one of those statements, and not seeing that must require a huge effort -- mostly consisting of ignoring the opinion of people of color.  




 It has always been a big deal to millions of people, most of them not white, all of them better educated than those who insist this was just a matter of "heritage" and "honor". And the only people freaking out now are hard core reactionaries -- the overwhelming public reaction has been simply "It's about damn time". 




 It definitely was sold there, at the western wear stand on the southeast corner of 17th and the main pedestrian boulevard, across from Brown Arena. 

The fact that so many people here don't remember seeing this hateful emblem for sale there is testament to how cavalier white society got about its continued use -- and also likely due to how overwhelmingly white the user base for /r/Columbus is.  




 No -- the comment you replied to was the one I was referring to. I doubt that he'll see your cautions, however, since he's already said this was a throwaway that he created for this use and then forgot about.

  




 The guy who did this is an idiot, on top of everything else. His idea of what sort of apology will fly here shows only that he learned nothing from all the times he told teachers that the dog ate his homework. 









 /u/crindee called it correctly -- you should mark it as solved. The signature matches the one on the link s/he provided. 









 Um, you do realize that it's been 70 years now since the CIO merged with the AFL, right? What you laid out here is a distinction that hasn't had any legal meaning since 1955, although I'm guessing it's still the entirety of what many textbooks still assert.

**tl;dr** All trade unions are labor unions. There are differences in how various unions are structured (and more so every day), but all are governed by the same laws and consider each other equal partners in the struggle for workers' rights and dignity. The claim that they are "two completely separate things" is simply wrong.

 Glad to see it get more eyeballs on it, but as expected that turns out to be the SPLC map. I wish that, instead of re-publishing it and bemoaning the reality it shows, major news orgs would instead use it as a map of where to look for stories *before* we have to read about still again yet another violent attack from people whose claims to "just have a different opinion" are routinely granted far too much credence in the press. 




 That's a [sun dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dogs). Pretty cool! 




 You're very welcome. After so many angry, cynical, navel-gazing posts in this reddit, it's refreshing to see one about someone wanting to work together with others to create more beauty for the place we all call home.

Who had the brilliant idea of creating a "hip, young" section for USAToday and calling it "ftw"? Find that jerk and fire him.  




  At this point I stopped caring,

Yeah, no. From the tone of your comments, you stopped caring before you started this discussion. I'm a mod elsewhere, so I know how to deal with users who break the rules. You completely failed to cushion your explanation with compassion -- and instead, accused the OP of "ignoring" you when she was merely pointing to how confusing this rule can be even when the user is not dealing with shock and grief.

You're off balance here. This exchange should have been about explaining the rules to someone who made a sincere mistake, not about spanking a naughty child. Modding is a tough job, but you really can do better than this. 




 Go on ... 




 Thanks for taking this sad occasion to spread knowledge of a disease most readers have never heard about. May I ask where this happened? 




 There are a lot of great acts on offer, including Columbus native Linda Dachtyl, but I'm most excited about [Eddie Palmieri](http://www.hotribscooljazz.org/artist/eddie-palmieri-latin-jazz-septet/) on Friday night.  




 This story is so much juicier than any headline can convey ... If you're just tuning in now, be sure to read the previous coverage at the links in the article. 









 In a tent the campers carried up by themselves, not a hotel pod permanently situated atop a ladder. 




 I know what/where it is. And what you cite about El Capitan is the *exact opposite* of what's going on here.


 




 I'm sorry for your loss, but that's not going to happen. 

The vet most likely had a legal obligation to treat any rabid animal the way she did Jiggie, and you could offer no assurance that it couldn't possibly be rabies, because you had allowed Jiggie to run loose. 

Some jurisdictions will allow a possibly rabid animal to live through a waiting period rather than kill it and dissect the brain (the only conclusive test), but even if your town allows this it won't matter because suing over veterinary care is something only a very wealthy person even *can* do.

The vet you went to lacks people skills, but suing won't change anything. Please just concentrate on remembering Jiggie at her strongest and best. 




 Some context would help. The last name looks like it might be Springer.

I'm suddenly extra grateful that US national parks don't allow tourists with enough money to just hang off the edge of El Capitan or Toroweap.  




 Yes, because reddit is literally the government. 




 It wasn't a police brutality protest, although many of those people are also involved in that work.

The event today was [the Ohio Student Association](http://www.ohiostudentassociation.org/end_zero_tolerance) statewide protest about zero-tolerance school discipline policies. The press advisory explaining the goals of the  demonstration is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DdXbYlyHXnUwYTj08oRvvF0nD5RR6VX43XnXLqhD2wY/edit?pli=1). It will be interesting to see how this is covered on the 6:00 local news; at noon Ch. 4 managed to cover a different story from across the street from the education Department and the OSA demo was so loud it was hard to hear the reporter -- but they had no coverage of this event.

OSA is a relatively new but very impressive organization. It's part of [the Ohio Organizing Collaborative](http://www.ohorganizing.org/) which has member groups (including unions) all over the state, and an innovative approach to organizing that mobilizes and trains young people to be effective leaders in various reform struggles, including elimination of student debt.

For these reasons and more, OSA was voted the Community Festival Honored Community Organization for 2015 -- see page 15 [here](http://apgmediaofohio.com/emags/Comfest2015/index.html). 




 As one who just yesterday was [very negative about a superficially similar pitch for funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColumbusSocial/comments/3d9iom/help_prevent_a_homeless_veteran_from_ending_up_on/), I have to say that Star House is a worthy charity that *should* be supported. I wish their IndieGogo page had  included a link to their website, where the [archive of news articles](http://www.osustarhouse.com/News-and-Events/News.aspx) makes it very clear how necessary and good their work is AND why they had to turn to crowdfunding.

Adding, a good friend who works there brought some of these kids to work volunteer shifts at ComFest, and they did an outstanding job.   




 You should go back and see what OP said when he finally came back to this post. 




 Fire codes for residential buildings generally forbid accumulating large quantities of fuel.

 What kids these days don't have to put up with, and don't even appreciate the change: those crank handles for the windows, that somehow always gouged one partner in the back at exactly the wrong moment.  




 But *that* topic (news about reddit) doesn't belong *here*, which is why it has now been removed. 




 If she hasn't been to a vet, please take her for blood and other tests. She could be just finicky  -- my elder kitty values variety above flavor -- but it could also be something like kidney failure causing the anorexia and vomiting.

 I wouldn't give money to this nonprofit, and -- speaking as a nonprofit administrator --  I would not recommend to anyone that they do, either. 

In the first place, there's no evidence that this IS a non-profit, aside from OP's assertion. There's no website, no link to evidence of an IRS charter or even sponsorship by an existing 501(c)(3), no board of directors. Not only is there absolutely nothing to inspire confidence, but there's one huge red flag: the most developed post on the FB page is a series of photos of a particular old mansion these folks propose to "fix up for transitional housing" -- this from people who admit elsewhere that they have no idea beyond bake sales for fundraising.

And all that is just from looking at the material OP presented to *this* reddit. [The most compelling reasons why no one should give money to this group are in the answers to the disturbingly basic question the OP raised over at /r/nonprofit.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/3d9m83/struggling_college_student_executive_director_of/)

  When my dentist did my wisdoms they offered to set me up on a caresource(?) card.

That was probably [Care Credit](http://www.carecredit.com/), a healthcare-specific finance company that covers everything from dental to dogs. I think the plan you were offered is just one of many.

Adding a reminder that OSU has *three levels* of dental clinics, from student practitioners to interns to faculty, depending on how much the patient can pay.

 




 Amen. This is Rule One.

In this case, they left general info, but because it was not a National Park they were not required to leave an exact itinerary with Rangers. Then they took one wrong turn (despite using a good map and having skills), which led to another, which led to another ... 

... and then they did the absolute *right* thing: stop, stay together, make themselves visible from the air, ration their food. I think folks in other parts of the country who over-blame these hikers are failing to understand how difficult S R work is in terrain like Bridger-Teton. Much of the time they were missing was taken up by searchers even getting to that quadrant to start looking.

Are you saying you think Bernie Sanders is a tool?  




 You jest, but it *is* serious business for rescue orgs, which have to scratch for every penny -- and a link to the original video would have offered the option to donate to the group that made folks here smile by rescuing those puppies.

/u/GallowBoob has explained his reasoning (users might be less likely to click a YouTube link than an imgur link); accepted the criticism that posting the gif could leave out critical info; and said he will post the original video link in the comments from now on. So it was worth a bit of conversation.  




 As I said originally:  

...this consequence of keeping info about rescue orgs from people who could support them...

/u/Gallowboob has accepted the criticism and says he will now post links to the  original video in the comments.
 




 That's a reasonable explanation, and a workable solution. Thank you. I'm looking forward to going back to upvoting you all over the place, as before. 




 He had not yet replied at the time I posted that comment -- and if you read his comment, he says that someone else did it for him. He didn't look it up himself, which takes all of about a minute.

I don't hate /u/GallowBoob or have it in for him. I just asked him to try harder to do better on sourcing. When he does that I'll *go back to* upvoting him.

 [Yes, and it's not a harmless one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/3cxekg/rescuing_a_homeless_dog_family_from_under_a_house/cszy08b) 




 Thank you for the full video link, which is what should have been posted in the first place.

The full video comes with full info, like where this happened, what *organization* (not random individuals) did the rescue, what happened to the puppies, and how to get in touch if you want to give the mama a home or donate money to this good work. All that got lost when the OP chose to snag this clip rather than go look for the whole thing.

The OP, of course, is /u/GallowBoob, who does this *all the time*. [I called him on it last week and he immediately deleted the post in question rather than let the criticism stand.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/3cg3s7/the_dog_who_fell_in_tar/csv68rk)

I used to just ignore the complaints about his karma-whoring, but this consequence of keeping info about rescue orgs from people who could support them has put me on the warpath about sourcing. It's just not that hard, and it really matters. 




 What, exactly, are they looking for? Temporary housing, or what?

Adding, this general question, having to be asked by a third party *on a Saturday*, is a nightmare. One has to wonder: how did they come to be evicted -- under a law that requires plenty of notice -- without having explored options for themselves? I'm not blaming them. I've watched folks nearing the bottom of their resources go into a glazed state and so fail to ask for help in a timely way. It just hurts to watch, every time.

Anyway, tell us more specifics, and maybe someone here can offer specific help.     














 What's your basis for saying this? Do you know them personally? Just getting lost doesn't mean they were unprepared (unless that now means failure to carry a sat phone or avalanche beacon).

 You may be thinking of [Durgin-Park](http://www.bostoncentral.com/restaurants/durgin_park/p20.php), a Boston restaurant famous for two things: roast beef and "sharp-tongued" waitresses who are *supposed* to be impatient and rude. I haven't been there for many years, but the food was totally worth the long wait and the attitude.

 I assume by "hate water" you mean they hate being wet -- but *drinking* enough water is the main thing you have to watch for. If one (esp. the elder kitty) isn't drinking enough, make sure s/he gets wet food with added water, or gravy. You could also brush them to remove extra fur (and show them you care).

Both of them should be fine, if cranky, unless the temps get to triple digits.  




 This is an interesting article, but it appears to have been lifted entirely from [this much more serious site](http://www.blackpast.org/aah/white-walter-f-1893-1955) and reposted on what's apparently a clickbait site, with the added insult that the "rewindingbalck.com" version actually *claims copyright* on the plagiarized text.

Thanks to the OP for posting -- but next time, may be you could check the source a bit more. 




 I think you're right! Your comment reminds me of my favorite quote from the writer who created your alter ego:  

["Get it right or let it alone. The conclusion you jump to may be your own."](http://www.gutenberg.ca/ebooks/thurberj-furtherfablesforourtime/thurberj-furtherfablesforourtime-00-h-dir/thurberj-furtherfablesforourtime-00-h.html) 




 That's not the worst way to go through life, actually ... 




 Ask local rescue groups as well as your local reddit for recommendations. Call ahead and talk to the receptionist -- this person's attitude will tell you a lot about whether this practice is the on for you. And wherever you wind up going, tell the doctor upfront that you have limited funds and want to know how much each step of assessment and care will cost *before* they start into it. 




 [Care Credit](http://www.carecredit.com/) may work for you. Have you specifically searched for low-cost vets in your area? You could ask your local reddit for suggestions. 




 A good article, but the headline makes it sound more crass than it really is. The money the author spent was shocking to her *in retrospect*, but it's clear that she was deciding on the basis of love (as she understood it then) as things went along and only noticing the financial cost later ... when she also belatedly recognized the cost in pain these treatments caused Kitty, and admitted having prioritized her own feelings above Kitty's well-being.

The decision to euthanize a beloved pet is always agonizing, and this author seems to have arrived at a better than average standard for making such decisions. Thanks to the OP for sharing that, and for opening up this discussion here. 




  I wonder if vets would allow me to post on their boards even if I'm not a customer? 

Yes, they probably will. As for places that will take 6 cats: probably no landlord will go for this. And that's why millions of renters lie about how many cats they have. As long as your rent is paid on time, and the cats aren't stinky or noisy, most landlords will choose an otherwise good tenant over the hassle of eviction and starting over to find a new tenant. I do think 6 in an apartment is probably too many for their sake, but if you haven't re-homed some/all of them by the time you move maybe you can keep them while you continue to look for new homes.

Offering one cat at a time really is best. Include some details about the cat's personality: what kind of toys it likes, what silly things it does, how it interacts with others, etc. Emphasize that there is a deadline (even if it's not firm) and that you're being slightly picky about who you'll allow to have your kitty. People are more likely to respond to the implied challenge of "are you good enough to adopt this particular wonderful cat?" than they are to the implied carelessness of "I've got too many cats -- want one?" 

Good luck!
 




 This sophistry is so far from "best of" material that OP should be thoroughly embarrassed to have submitted it here. 




 Kittens are adorable just the way they are.  




 It didn't burn down, it just got so decrepit as to be dangerously unusable. [It was closed in 1968 and torn down in 1971.](https://library.osu.edu/blogs/archives/2011/08/23/original-university-hall-razed-40-years-ago-today/) I've only gone in there once since, but I'm guessing they did not rebuild the old Green Room in the basement, because that's when they built the theater in the Drake Union to replace the one in U Hall.  




 OP isn't looking for a whole house, but rather an apartment in a big house that has been split into apartments. 




 Columbus doesn't have a lot of what you're talking about, except in the OSU area. What we do have is a lot of duplexes -- so that may be a term you want to look for. 




 Buying boots this close to the hike is not a good idea: they could not possibly be broken in before you start. OTOH, sneakers won't cut it. You should immediately buy a pair of trail runners or lowcut hiking shoes -- something that has serious tread and arch/ankle support, but will break in fast. Merrell has some shoes that don't require long break-in; Hi-Tec specializes in shoes that are wearable right out of the box (but don't last for as long as others).

More important is that this question raises another question: whether you've bitten off more than you can chew here. How accustomed are you to long-distance hiking? How strong are your knees? Have you backpacked much? Do you live at sea level? All of these questions are important, and if you give us more detail we can give you more help.

Two points that will help, no matter what your experience:  
(1) remember to cut your toenails before starting out; and
(2) you can make the whole trip easier by sending your pack and tent down and up again by mule. It costs $68.42 each way and is totally worth it. If you decide to use the [mule duffel service](http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/phantom-ranch/duffel-services/) just on way, make it the downhill trip. That's much harder than the uphill, especially if you're going down the Kaibab and up BA. 

  




 That's a natural reaction, but I always have a second thought as well: a place this beautiful should never be the private property of any person, but should be available for everyone to share. 

Maybe that's because I grew up in [Connecticut, where the entire seashore is essentially privatized.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMS-EfcWrSw)  









 Nope. 




 I never offered an example. You're confusing me with another commenter, which happens when you're in too much of hurry -- much like the original problem, which was your failure to specify that you meant "the world's first (*major*) non-non opiate pain med". If you go back and read only the exchange between you and me, you can see where you started responding to the wrong person.  




 Link and Hagrid are so lucky to have been left at your house! Please keep us posted (with lots of photos) as they grow. 




 I never said you did. But by not being specific, you did make a ridiculous claim.  




 Please start by reading the reddit Guide to Columbus in the sidebar, and using the search function to find other threads about this (yours is at least the third one today!).

Then come back and tell us some relevant details, like how much you want to pay and whether you really need to be on the bus line, so people can help you in a meaningful way. 




 (1) read the reddit Guide to Columbus (linked in the sidebar);
(2) use the search function to find previous such threads;
(3) forget "property management companies" when looking for a house -- this only makes sense for apts.; and
(4) drive around the desired neighborhood looking for signs. 




 How did you come to be bottle feeding such a tiny (and adorable) kitten? 




 Fine. But that's not what was at issue here. /u/tomjoads made a flat assertion about *all* painkillers, and I was pointing out how ridiculous such a broad, nonspecific claim really is.

I can't take opiates, and I'm really tired of people leaping right past other pain control modalities to assume that opiates are the answer. That way of thinking (among docs as well as patients) is a big part of the problem the CDC describes. 




 What you said was

 the worlds first non opiate pain med

If you meant something different, some subset of that, you did not say so. That was my point.

 




 That's the idea! Just remember there are always other things on the ballot, even in a primary. 




 There are plenty of those already in existence. 




 [Details here.](http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/nuesse/pistazie/pistazie.htm#selbsterhitzung) 




 Did you read the reddit Guide to Columbus, linked in the sidebar of /r/Columbus? Have you searched old posts on /r/Columbus for similar questions and answers? This gets asked (and answered) there *constantly*, so be sure to check those out and then come back and ask more specific questions. 




 I would love to vote Democrat in the general elections if we can get Bernie on the ticket past the primaries!

... and that's why you're going to register as a Democrat, first thing tomorrow morning, right? 




 It was *never* cool, and if you'd had to step over the many users who passed out *on the sidewalk*, or answer crisis calls from the girls who had been date raped because of sopors, you'd never want anything to do with it. There's a reason why so many young people at the time believed this drug flooded the streets as a  government plan to derail the anti-war movement, which was peaking in the early 70s. It's functionally the opposite of LSD, designed to make you useless and unconscious.   




 Submission statement: Quaaludes are the nearly forgotten drug Bill Cosby admitted using for date rape -- and he wasn't alone. This 1973 article delineates some of the reasons why activists at the time conducted a campaign against this "death drug" -- [here's more about that grassroots campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689). 









 See also this [anti-sopor campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689) by anti-war activists of the time. 









 Must have been very late 60s, because they really did show up very suddenly in 1970. A lot of memories have faded by now, but the plague of people falling down and passing out *on the sidewalk* is unfortunately still vivid, along with the epidemic of date rapes that pushed us to start the first rape crisis center in Ohio.

 




 Quaaludes -- also called "sopors" -- are a soporific (sleeping pill) that had a sudden rush of popularity in the early 70s as a recreational drug, with a very significant usage as a date-rape drug. 

There was a theory advanced by radical anti-war activists (mainly Yippies and the underground press, starting from Ann Arbor) that there was government involvement in the sudden widespread street-level availability of such "death drugs" -- as opposed to pot and LSD -- intended to blunt the rising popular opposition to the Viet Nam war and the recession. 

[Here is a 1973 article about the national anti-sopor campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689), showing the "WAKE UP! No more sleeping pills in our community" graphic that appeared on thousands of T-shirts and millions of posters that year. And [here is a history of Quaaludes](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/unconsciousness-expansion-the-sopor-story-19730329) published that same year by Rolling Stone. 




 The first appearance of Quaaludes as a recreational drug was late 1970. There was a grassroots campaign at the time, started by activists in Ann Arbor and spread through the underground press, to convince young people to not use the drug. I still have my ["Wake Up! No more sleeping pills in our community" ](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689) shirt, along with some leaflets and news articles ... somewhere in storage.

EDIT: [Here's a BIG flashback about the drug we called Sopors.](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/unconsciousness-expansion-the-sopor-story-19730329) 




 Oh wise one, aren't you getting a wee bit ahead of yourself here? 




 Cow piss in a bottle. 




 Thanks for the info, in both comments. 

 




 [Here's the full story, from the organization that saved this dog last year in India.](http://www.animalaidunlimited.com/blog/dog-submerged-in-rock-solid-tar-rescued/) They deserve the credit, not somebody who ripped off two frames of their video and posted them without context to imgur.

If I could find that in 2 minutes, so could you, /u/Gallowboob. 









 I know the headline here is a quote from the subject of this article, but as a headline it's tone deaf: most of the new social energy around climate change is coming from precisely "faith-based arguments that deal with climate change" -- from the opposite direction. When the Pope issued his Encyclical last week calling for a moral campaign against human-made climate change, he was standing on the base built over the past few years by many other religious leaders who say stewardship of the planet is a basic responsibility for people of faith. So this headline is just seriously odd, not to mention confusing.

 




 Date rape is what Quaaludes are famous for, and have been since the 1970s. Have you been living under a rock?  




 It's actually hilarious -- that's the problem. I stopped watching it when they went neanderthal in public, but I'm still tempted sometimes. 




 First, thank you for taking care of these kitties. You've done a good thing, and trolls can't change that.

Some questions:  
How old are they? Are they all neutered and vaccinated?    
Have your posts included photos? Have you advertised them all together, or separately? 
Have you posted to other local reddits, including school-specific ones?
How fast do you have to move on this? Is there an external pressure, or is it just time to move them along?

I don't have any magic trick. In my experience (I re-homed dozens of kittens over several years in another city), it comes down to sheer persistence and highlighting each cat individually. For leaflets and online posts, a good portrait photo plus a compelling back story helps. I've also gone to the extreme of taking the kittens to a place where they would be seen -- the parking lot of a gourmet grocery store or a popular restaurant on a Saturday afternoon -- and letting people hold them, which increases attraction exponentially. (I wouldn't hand them over permanently at first contact. Anyone interested in adopting would have to come by the next day and go through the interview.) 

You're doing the right things. Keep on keeping on with those, and keep asking for more help. In my experience, friends and family will make one perfunctory effort when you first ask, but it's only when you become relentless that something finally works. Don't be afraid of being the squeaky wheel! 

 




 He's the exception. I meant, he has zero chance *absent the intervention of a whole other network of volunteers trying to mitigate the effects of bad shelter policy.* Those networks can save only a fraction of the cats condemned by the failure to implement good public policy (subsidized spay/neuter; comprehensive humane education; mandatory licensing, etc.).  




 Are those rentals even legal? Residential landlords have to register with the county auditor.

And why are you talking to the police about fire codes?

EDIT: do you mean *housing* codes? 




 Says the redditor for 14 days. You're wrong about that, btw.
