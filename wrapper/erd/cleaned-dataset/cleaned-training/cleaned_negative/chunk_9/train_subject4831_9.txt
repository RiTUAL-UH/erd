 Thanks :D I am new here I think I made some mistakes xo 




 Preaching to the choir man, threading last longer but hurts a lot more ;) 




 Because it draws attention to my lady-stache D: 




 Yeh it would, however the clients insisted on fake. You can always use this technique to create other fake foods though :) 









 Hey there, first time posting to here so be kind. I made fake chocolates for a zombie movie and wanted to share with you how to make them for yourselves.

What you will need:
Chocolate of your choice,
Silicone,
Super glue,
A tile (or a surface silicone will not stick to),
Fact Cast,
Paint,
Brushes,
Stirring stick.

This process is super quick, simple and easy and you can use it to make any fake food.

 I didn't think it would get that many up votes, Reddit is a strange place.

 Humans love to fix things and create. 




 Love the dark and spooky look, do you have more pics of the city? 




 Pretty terrifying, reminds me of the green man from Always Sunny in Philidelphia. 




 I would like to see the percentage of how people's day is going, 100% being that they had the best day of their life. That way you could try and cheer up or help the lower percentage people.  




 If literally I think your percentages would change XD  




 Percentage of someone's risk of killing you is a great one. Imagine getting on a train and you see a gang, normally kind of risky, yet the little old lady standing behind you has a 95% chance! 




 You can see a percentage above everyone, but not your own. You aren't able to reveal this information to others. What would you like this percentage to represent?
