 I live in a little village in the Alps and one sunny afternoon, a few weeks ago, I was sitting on the balcony, enjoying the rest of the day. Then I heard a horse-drawn carriage and kids talking and laughing. The sounds came closer and I saw an older man sitting, leading the carriage and that *picture*, with those beautiful horses, the happy kids, that amazing smell of pure nature, just at the beginning of dusk, was so overwhelmingly wonderful, that I must have grinned quite silly, because the man waved and smiled back! Just like that! It was so kind of him, it made my whole week. :)) 




 Not too long; did read - Oh my gosh.. hahaha thank God no one sees my blushing... I wasn't ranting and raving at you anyway. :) I'm really sorry I expressed it so poorly (English is not my native language, unfortunately). I just had the urge to tell him, that what he said was neither nice, nor productive. Obviously. And now that I understand, your reply was actually really funny! :D

You don't have to be sorry, by all means, and please don't call your thoughts 'shenanigans' (I hope you weren't serious about that, as well), I learned something new thanks to you! :)) *googles Kawaiisu* 




 Doesn't really matter, if he/she missed it or not. This is not a nice way to talk to someone, especially when someone talks about his/her feelings!  
If everything was that easy, we could just tell ourselves "to harden the fuck up", but that's not always the case, as we know. If "IamDolos" is in the mood to not take people's feelings seriously, he/she can do that with himself, but definitely not with someone else.

Sorry, no harm meant. 




 Who do you think you are?
