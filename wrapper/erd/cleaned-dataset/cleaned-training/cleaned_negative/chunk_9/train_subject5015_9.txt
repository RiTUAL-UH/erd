 Why does this say there's 134 comments...http://gyazo.com/7cbb3af22d63e270350b215de138b47b 




 Gotta say I agree, on the fence because of that. 




 It's hard to keep a cool head at all. These men have had training, even the cop has been in life threatening situations before, and you can tell they're still visibly shaken by whats going on. 




 Was the first thing I realized, it looks almost like a painting edited in. 




 I can't tell if you're baiting or just a college kid who thinks he's morally superior to everyone that's made a big mistake in their life. Either way, you're making some pretty huge assumptions from one video and an article. Then again this is Reddit, we do love making assumptions and judging people based on them. 




 Thought you were talking about the cop or the nurse since I didn't finish the video...i'm pretty slow. 




 I'm so confused. 




 +1 also been noticing bad AA after patch. had to turn on MSAA x2 and lose like 5 fps. 




 thank you 




 This is pretty off topic but does anyone know the default hotkey for the Quickplay Action? I've searched an searched but I can't find it in the keybindings. 




 I'm a power hungry control freak. 




 This guy http://socialclub.rockstargames.com/member/360madden?headSearch=true was in my online game today teleporting around and killing everyone with rocket launchers. Oh yeah and he was invincible. Just a heads up. Already submitted a ticket to R*. 




 I'm with simon on this one. He really grew on me by the end. 




 Anyone know why his account was shadow-banned/deleted? 




 It's not an unpopular opinion, i'm not sure where you're getting that impression. Even though I did play with a level 6 for one of the heists who could communicate and play alright I still feel like a minimum level would be a good idea. 




 I played with one friend for all the heists, finding two other randoms and for the majority of it I found people that could communicate or if they couldnt communicate they were usually still pretty alright at the game and could listen to instructions. Got all of the heists done this way. Maybe it's because im playing on the PC though. 




 Humane labs raid was really really fun too. Also enjoyed the stealth setup. Series A funding was definately the worst, just a bunch of missions. 




 Any idea how this happened? 









 Hannibal Buress was only a guest on the show, which runs for 30 minutes, she could have come to watch the rest of it and just not found Hannibal funny. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Howard's_Good_News 




 Hey,

Need 2 English speaking peeps to do some heists with. Me and my friend are on the last heist, have done the first setup. Much prefer it if you have a microphone and are willing to communicate, but text chat can work as well. 20/20/20/40 split.
We would be up for completing the last heist within the next few hours. Cheers 









 His character is in an NPC corp so i guess he went on an alt? We were bashing a NC. r32/r64 because we didn't want to wait for HERO's leadershit to transfer it, one hour in divinerapier warps 100 off the POS. He burns around for about 30 seconds. 5 minutes later an NPC corp character lights a cyno off the pos and we get hotdropped by the NC. (we had a few dreads on field to speed it up). I remember people in HERO defending him too.  




 If someone asks just say you're friends with the person. Don't draw attention to yourself and don't give away more information than necessary. 




 Is DivineRapier confirmed as a spy yet? He's done some extremely shady shit in the past. 




 Helium also has the same effect and is used for suicides, partially too because it's freely available (they sell it in cans for blowing up balloons). 




 Download from one site, upload to another. That's I think the easiest way.

Do you think HERO has access to the PRISM metadata? I'm confused as to why you think you need that. 




 Thank you for this. 




 Well you might still win the award for most hilarious warning though. 




 Nice video although I wish people would stop cutting these off right when the enemy team reacts in all chat, that's my favorite part. 




 The only time my relatively small corp almost killed a Titan...too bad their ishtar fleet was just a few jumps out. 




 This was posted in an april fools prank thread a year or two ago (2), and someone that worked at a zoo basically replied saying that they get dozens every year, and that it's a huge waste of their limited resources. I felt bad after that. 




 You will truly be remembered as a dank memer. *tip*. 




 10/10 would read again 




 Funny, someone suggested something like this in the 'what niche private tracker communities would you like to see" thread, think it was top upvoted too. I would love to see something like this too! Would even be up for starting it but I really have 0 experience. 




 Why does it say month tradeban? I assumed tradebans are permanent

 A Zen master was asked what he would do if he knew the world was going to end in 30 minutes. He said meditate. Not contact his family, or try and stop it, just meditate. 

I of course being completely undisciplined and having no idea how to meditate would end up panicking and trying to stop it, and failing horribly.

 Finger lickin' goodness! 




 If you're on a windows pc press windows key + r, type 'msconfig', go to the startup tab, uncheck what you don't want to startup, press apply, okay.

This is a pretty simple question too, not trying to be acidic but you could literally just google 'how to turn off startup programs for windows'.

Also if you're on a mac: http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_remove_startup_items_os_x this was the first thing that turned up on google. 














 Can't tell if bullshitting. 99% possibility of cow shit. 




 Dont know if this is exactly what you're looking for but they say somewhat broadly what they defined as positivity and toxicness in their blog post, http://idibon.com/toxicity-in-reddit-communities-a-journey-to-the-darkest-depths-of-the-interwebs/ 




 If i'm understanding it right, you guys are (very basically) good at processing large ammounts of text and offering very specific insights into it? I'm curious about the split between machine learning and human intervention, if you could provide some more information on that? How advanced the machine learning is and where the human has to step in, for example. 




 If you buy Skippy from there, is it reasonably priced? 









 Practice is probably the most important thing.  




 That cat is so chill. My cat would be a million miles away the second I picked up the bag. 




 Hey, I just wanted to thank you for posting this, used it in this composition: http://wattsquotes.tumblr.com/post/114543432379/you-are-that-vast-thing-that-you-see-far-far-off, thank you! 









 I have no words for the ammount of stupidity in your comment. He's made over 20 million dollars for charity, been on the BBC,CNN,WSJ etc.. He visited Liberia to raise awareness and funds for Ebola. If anyone's scamming anyone, it's you with that comment. http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.9248995/k.7CEB/After_Ebola.htm http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary orgid=4438

You don't have to like how he does it, but you cannot deny that he has a good heart and has probably saved thousands of lives. 




 You literally donate directly to save the children, only reason not to is if you don't have the cash. 




 fuck the haters #2legit2quit 




 It's obviously fake but it's hilarious. It's even more hilarious watching people trying to 'share the truth', this is what Athene does, anyone that's followed him for long enough knows that. He's raised over 20 million dollars for save the children (http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.8157995/k.7191/Athene_and_Gaming_for_Good.htm) You don't have to like how he does it, but you cannot deny that he has a good heart. 




 I love how he takes his paw off the cooler..."Can you fuckin' not" 




 This is on the London Tube too which is why she's not looking directly. 




 Fucking Steven. 




 How do you motivate yourself? 




 That's awesome, cheers for the info. 




 It makes anybody that has a sense of humor laugh. You evidently do not. I would much rather walk round a fence to get my keys than spend 30 minutes taking off buble wrap and styrofoam. 




 Can you shed some light on how you don't get into shit for impersonating a cop? Don't some tourists go away thinking that the NYPD cops drink? I'm genuinely interested. 




 So it's not the seedboxs fault then, either change provider or ask wcd to try and get cloudflare to unblock it (doubtful). 




 Thank you 




 Wish there was a video for this. 




 Welcome to reddit, where everyone makes assumptions and then judges you based on them. It's how we caught the Boston bomber.... *cough*. 




 Yeah it seems really dumb for him to call you something like that...people like drama way too much. 




 Coming from someone that's English, just don't call someone a child of a chap... or you might get punched... 




 From one of the top comments 'reasonable people don't like racist douchebags or what they have to say.' 




 Some people think it's fake on every video like this that is posted. On videos like this though, it dosen't matter, the message stays the same. 




 Peoples attention spans are getting lower and lower....it's the only way to get them to watch. On the other hand though I agree with you, I would much rather watch the raw footage.

A mistake on the manufacturers part is always a lot more likely than some kid having access to a can sealer   label printer at home and putting a bloody worm in it to laugh on stream when he eats it. 




 Fuck...guess I shouldn't go to any stores or bars anymore before I get to know them. 




 Why assume that it was intentional/ill-willed? See the comments above, 99% of the time it's an accident on the part of the manufacturer, reddit fucking loves drama and it's stupid how little they examine a situation before discussing it. 




 I think Pascha calling him a terrorist was just a knee-jerk reaction to someone wearing a headscarf, probably a muslim/sikh or something like that. Reddit fucking loves drama, and they can ignore any and all assumptions just to eat it up. 




 So sexy. 




 Thank you for doing this! Will send you one a bit later on. 




 It might seem like that but we can never really know because we don't have the raw footage availible.  




 I have a jumper that I wear with a ferrari logo just because it's extremely comfortable....maybe don't judge everyone by the clothes they're wearing lol. 




 Hah. Announcer dude was actually my secondary school PE teacher....scariest PE teacher ever but also the nicest. 




 Last month reddit had 151,712,210 million unique pageviews...not quite the secret club some people think it is. 




 Video wasn't appearing for me until I turned off my adblock. 




 I wish I could just ban people IRL I disagreed with. 




 Can someone transcribe this for me? 




 Yeah I get that, the title just makes it seems like this is some sort of official thing. I thought it was common knowledge that you can find 99% of popular tv shows online for free. 




 What? This isn't its website, it's fan made and probably illegal. They would never just put all their episodes online for free. 




 Yes yes, you are correct correct. 




 Awesome. 




 This is pretty late.. but i'm wondering if you have any formal education in computer science/RE or if you're self taught? RE has always interested me but i'm not sure I would be able to get a formal education in it. 




 It is a real sheriffs car, they had the cop close by because obviously he couldnt just leave his vehicle there, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yvQk0WF6eM. 




 No, just a video that has yet to be DMCA'd: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yvQk0WF6eM 




 The first thing they'll do when they see a crash is call for an ambulance... no need to waste an operators time.

 He has some inside info. RIP in pieces private trackers. 




 For me only if it's freeleech. My only reason for downloading one would be to watch something in my native 1920x1080, which is a big plus. I usually delete them after a week or so because they're so big. 




 Shitty camera? 




 Really good video, horrible title (youtube title, good job OP at changing it.)

 On average they get 15 common colds a year, versus the 4 of an adult. 




 All of what you said plus a big factor for me is seed retention. If I find a movie on a public tracker that has little to no seeders I can almost gauranteed download it from a private tracker using my entire bandwidth. 




 You're probably right, SMFC is more beliveable. Good call.
