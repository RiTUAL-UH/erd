 Jigglypuff because it's my fave Pokemon! :o 




 But he is SO great we all have to vote for him anyway  




 That is the same thing I said in another thread! 




 I don't understand why everyone loves Sawyer. I mean, he could fart into the microphone and still win. -_- 




 YOU SHOULD STOP JUDGING EVERYONE 




 Four nickels?

 This makes me sad :( 




 Nomiibo  




 Sonic!!! D: 




 Yeah I did, but I bet someone else would take up your offer! 




 Haha, okay! 




 I'm wondering if I should pick up this game. If the online part isn't as active anymore, should I still get it?  




 I was wondering which of these games would be the most fun for me. I really like animal crossing, which I know is often compared to these two. The reviews are also pretty good for both games. Which do you think is better, or are they different and both good to have? And how bad are the frame rate issues with story of seasons? 




 What about the tournament mode too? 




 I wish I got platinum :( so many better choices 




 Why will it be impossible to fill a lobby 




 Why? 




 Yasss sistah

 SHEIK IS MY PASSION 




 Ya 




 do people actually do that? With no desire to appear acceptable in any way? 




 ;) 




 And quitters never perspire 




 Or should I wait until post game  




 Can anyone explain the whole Gross case? 




 Yeah probably because that song is old and wasn't really popular so it's weird that she would just quote it.
