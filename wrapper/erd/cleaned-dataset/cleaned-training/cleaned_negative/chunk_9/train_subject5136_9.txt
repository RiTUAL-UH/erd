 This was one of my favorite features... why did this get removed? 




 Or a heating system that is 50 years old, and got duped by Integrys/Spark Energy. 




 I honestly can't tell if you are sarcastic or not. 




 I live in West Rogers Park and pay $1330 for a 3 bedroom. It's not luxury or fancy either. My gas bill is through the roof in the winter - got over $300 bill in December. 




 Sounds about right. My 3 bedroom apartment in West Rogers Park costs me about 33% of my wages (after taxes). And it's not a very nice building either. And I make $75k a year and I'm having budget issues - it's rough. 




  Despite dumping in nearly half a billion dollars, the public is not going to see any return on that investment until the second, or possibly third Superbowl they host, and that could be decades away.

Every Sunday people come from out of town to go to the stadium. Not to mention playoffs - and taxes generated all season long from higher ticket prices (and more seats than before). Not saying it is justified, but the money *does* come back quite quickly. 

It's also a function of "don't give us money - and we will go to another city". In that case the city would lose millions without the stadium there. 




 Saying that you will use force - without actually using it - is diplomacy. What Obama has done is naive and delusional diplomacy to the extreme where it not diplomacy - it is stupidity. 









 Amex Platinum Business is the card I am using. 









 Wouldn't have to go to war if the middle east thought he had a backbone of any kind. Not sure if war is the answer, but this 'deal' is a joke.  




 I live in Chicago. I think I'm ok. NY on the other hand... 




 "it only cost $.24 cents a mile"

That's nice, except that it's traveling around 8-9 miles per second, so that is a very misleading statistic. It costs $7,500 per hour, or $173,000 grand per day. Also, those costs continue. 

Pictures of Pluto are cool, but roughly $100 million per year? There are also lots of other space programs. This is just one of many. The question if we should be spending this money. Also not sure why comparing this to a Vikings stadium built for a private company at no cost to the taxpayer has any comparison to a space program. 




 RemindMe! 5 years "Too soon to celebrate" 




 Let's talk in five years when we see the results of this 'deal'. 

RemindMe! 5 years "Too soon to celebrate" 




 Jewish Liberals don't like Bibi? This is not news. 




 "The only argument you can make against the verification and inspection mechanism that weve put forward is that Iran is so intent on obtaining a nuclear weapon that no inspection regime and no verification mechanism would be sufficient because theyd find some way to get around it because theyre untrustworthy.

This. That is the entire point. They are not even remotely trustworthy. It's a grave mistake that we will all pay for. And the fact that Obama legislated this doesn't matter. If a Republican suggested something similar, I would be as equally opposed. 




 I would have the same reaction if some Republican made the same 'deal' with Iran. Has nothing to do with Obama.  




 I would have thought still Obama would be worse. Honestly, that has proven to be true, especially with this Iran deal. 




 This makes the president look good? News to me. 




 Who the hell is complaining about super? Really? How? 




 Also check this list if you can't remember what a genocide is:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genocides_by_death_toll 




 Also ironic that there has been many *actual* genocides in Africa since the 'genocide' that you are referring to. 

And what year did this genocide take place exactly? You do know what a genocide is, right? 

Ironically, America is more guilty of genocide of Native Americans than Israel is of Palestinians.  




 Ah here we go. You've gone all full retard. 




 Oh I see so we should get rid of all **Jews** from ALL political influence. Sounds familiar...  




 So we should eliminate anyone who has any religious faith whatsoever from office? Do you *want* to piss off Republicans and moderate Democrats? 




 comic books. I'm asking about video games. 




 Surprise! 

not. 




 MK? Are you joking? I hope you are. 




 Why the hell would someone downvote this? 




 Great stuff dude 




 i could care less about VP, so that wasn't a factor for me. They don't really do anything. How useful is Biden? Would have voted for her over Obama though. 

Anyway I would't say I agree with all Republicans (many of them are idiots, especially Trump), but I wouldn't call myself a moderate. I agree with Republicans in principle frequently, but I find they don't properly articulate their points, and generally provide shitty solutions. But the ideas of liberals - I disagree with *both* the implementation of their 'solutions', and with most of their fundamental principles. 




 Seriously does anyone think this movie is not going to suck tremendous ass? C'mon. We all know better. It will be horrendous. 

EDIT: For those downvoting me: provide examples of video game to movie successes.  




 Compensation is best in the country - for now. 




 I vote for Republicans, and I don't understand this at all. The guy is a whack. 




 Yea except if you spend $70 billion on these universities, they will turn around and raise tuition - and it will be $140 billion in 5 years. 




 It's been the Democrat/Republican way, for basically forever. 




 That's an easy way to dismiss my point. Good job.

Actually to be clear, you weren't being a troll. It's a misuse of the word. I think you were wrong, but that doesn't make you a troll. There is a big difference. A troll just says things to piss people off. I know you weren't doing that 




  At any rate, the alternative of smart kids being trapped by their financial circumstances, what we have today, is immoral and a national disgrace. Just my two cents.

The real problem is the cost of tuition. It rises 5% a year, regardless of the return on investment (which has gone down), quality of education (better facilities =/= better education). The cost is the real core problem, and this does not address that issue. Bernie offers short-sighted fixes to symptoms, instead of deep fixes of underlying issues.  




 So what is to prevent schools from raisin tuition? 

What I would like:

1. Force all public colleges to reduce current tuition cost by 30%. period. Federal law - you cannot charge more than that.

2. Public colleges can no longer raise tuition for at least 10 years. After that, at a maximum of the current rate of inflation.

3. THEN the federal government will pay 2/3rd, and states will pay 1/3rd

Without 1 and 2, the system will be completely screwed.

And lets not forget you still need to find $70 billion somewhere. 




 Well maybe your comment "His opinion doesn't matter" is really a stupid statement. It's just as relevant as his opinion on income inequality (which by the way, most people on this subreddit agree he will likely not be able to get what he wants done anyway). If someone said, "This Republican's opinion on gay marriage doesn't matter" - I'm sure you would find a way to explain why it *does* matter, and how it's crucial, and you can never vote for a candidate who doesn't approve gay marriage.

So in short, it's hypocritical, and intellectually dishonest. 




 1 vote for Japanese Kai 




 Where is that quote? I don't remember it, so I'm thinking I didn't watch that part in English Dub 




 I hate #2 people 




 Sounds like multiverse 




 Vegeta eating a little of his pride, and deciding to train with Goku - then obviously there is a lot of fighting between the two. Goku wants to rest, and Vegeta wants to keep training. Eventually Vegeta gives in and realized how much better he trains when he rests properly. Vegeta proceeds to surpass Goku. 




 The fact that 21 was 6 years ago for me 




 Which means that drop shots nowadays bounce much less than back in the day. 




 So this has nothing to do with the context of the post - just that pic? 




 I don't get it. 




 Make that 4k 




  Vengeance is pointless and cruel

It's not - and vengeance isn't the point. The only problem is we don't know for sure they are guilty - hence the innocent people put to death. For such serious crimes, there is no rehabilitation at all. So what's the point? There is a point of no return for such people - again, the only problem is practically being able to prove without a doubt that the person is guilty - which takes years, and isn't even 100% accurate. 




 Should he retire if he wins this one? I think so. 




 Cool thanks 




 I don't think it's crazy to think he might not have been born in this country. 

I think it's crazy to keep talking about it, because you'll never be able to prove it, and it makes you look really, really petty and pathetic. 




 In BoG, Goku has mad that he only gained the power of SSJG because of other people. He hated that it had to come from others, and not from himself.

So what happened to that in Resurrection 'F'? I haven't seen it, except for the leaked footage where both he and Vegeta fight Freiza as SSJGSJJ (whatever you call it, the blue hair). 

So did I miss something? Or did Goku just stop caring that the power didn't come from him?

Also random question about Buu saga - **why didn't Babidi use Dabura's energy to help revive Buu??** 




 So I was looking at LIQD just now, and on my Robinhood app, it said the price was $.20, on Yahoo Finance it said $.23. That's a big difference. Which one would be more accurate? 




 It's poor design, with old technology, with unionized workers, from companies making deals with corrupt politicians... 




 Ever heard of a poisonous apple? Also I didn't say which country was the apple... 




 I was being ironic 




 That was exactly my point. 




 I think it's time that we ban the United States of America flag. It represents racism and oppression of Native Americans. We should be ashamed to have the flag as our national symbol. 




 Actually you would still want to file if you have kids, or if you went to school. You will get money back. 




 Your McLaren example is crazy if you are talking about the F1. No one has 2x of them. No one. 




 One of the biggest bull markets in our history, and low unemployment/weak recovery. Income inequality didn't cause those things - it is the result of those things. 




 Why the F should the state be responsible for bailing us out? It's my opinion that every single resident of Illinois needs to feel the pain of our mistakes. *Every single person*. 




 Or maybe they are simply unhappy with the current Democrats in power, regardless of who is running with a (D) next to their name. Remember all the Democrats running from Obama before the midterm elections? 




 Tell me about it 




 What Republican candidate thinks the unemployment rate tells the whole story??? This is what Republicans have been saying for years. Seriously.  




 No child goes hungry. It's called SNAP.  




 Yea I really hate the comparisons to a country that is so vastly different to the point where a comparison is like comparing an apple to a Toyota. 




 Has anyone considered that income inequality is a symptom, not a cause?  




 This is on top of many other expenditures, including the red line improvement, which was $1 billion. It adds up. It's the mentality - every $50 million we spend - "Oh, it's just a little bit". That's how you go bankrupt. That's how people end up with thousands in credit card debt they cannot pay. You spend a little here, a little there, and all of a sudden you owe $10,000 that you cannot pay back. 

Of course, pensions are killer. Not taking away from that. 




 It's not unusable and 'crumbling'. It's just not efficient - and you know what - if we are so damn broke, then we should consider closing the purple line express if its going to cost so damn much. Priorities.  




 Yea it's absolutely ridiculous. $200 million? Dear lord. Why is there even a Jarvis stop? It's 3 blocks from Howard. I was once looking for parking for the Howard station, and I realized I was at the Jarvis station.  




 What the hell happened on May 26th? Subreddit of the day/week or something? 




 SWEET 




 That's my point. We are broke. Yet we throw $30 million at a project that saves commuters 5 minutes? This is why we are so damn broke. No one can make responsible decisions. 




 Used to ride that purple line, and for an 'express' - damn it was slow. But $30 million? Do we even have that money? That's a buttload of money to save commuters 5-7 minutes... 




 Wasn't this exact same thing posted yesterday? 




 I would rather have slightly higher-than-normal voices than the terrible and corny voice acting in English.  




 Huge upset the other day with Gasquet beating Wawrinka, but I can barely find anything about it. Granted this was two days ago, I should be able to find something easy. Scrolled down and clicked on a link only to find the score sheet. All this redesign of the websites just for the sake of trying to be trendy is all at the expensive of good user experience. /r/webdev it's your fault. 




 I hate this comment karma piggybacking shit. Just make a new post. There is no reason for this to be under another comment. If you are responding directly to the OP, it should be a new comment - not a response to an existing comment. Karma sluts. 




 Yes Python or C, or C++ should be the first language. NOT Java. 









 My first two CS classes ever were both Java. I had no idea what I was doing. It was pretty hard. Got a B, but didn't really learn shit. 




 Self driving cars 




 This. It's the worst. You tell a story and some ass goes, "Oh yeah? I can do you one better!". Like seriously dude, I didn't know we were at the 7th annual pissing contest. I'm just trying to chat you douche. 




 You sure about that? Let's check back in 5 years. Also see Greece, France, Spain

RemindMe! 5 years "Other countries seem to be just fine with 'better' wealth distribution" 




 I think you don't know what you are talking about. 




 Significantly higher taxes. Like 30% higher than they are now. 




 They don't contrast each other now?? 




 Sure the future - but not today. He has no chance of winning. None. Get over it Reddit. It's NOT going to happen. 




 I think people underestimate the recoil of moderate liberals, moderate Republicans, and of course hard-right Republicans. Moderate liberals are much more likely to vote for someone to the right of Obama, not someone vastly to the Left. 




 What a surprise. Those who receive government benefits don't want to give up government benefits... 




 Those lenders are filthy pigs. 




 No 




 And? So then its OK to have these criminals? Don't marginalize, it doesn't prove your point. 




 Today, Clinton is pro-Israel. Tomorrow, if the polls show that it is unfavorable to do so - she is anti-Israel. 




 Yes it's also that colleges have realized the students will take on any debt (which means private as well) in order to get a loan. They keep raising tuition *because they can*. The only thing that can really stop tuition rise is mandated tuition levels, and/or a paradigm shift in how much we value college. 









 Point me to a poll that actually shows this, and I'll consider your baseless claim to be partly true. 




  Hillary wants to be President of the United States and Bernie Sanders wants to serve the country.

This. Nailed it! 




 two extreme examples, I hardly think doctors are 'living in fear'.  




 This violates rules of /r/askreddit. This does not belong here. Please remove. 




 Since when does it work everywhere? Spain? Greece? France? 




 I noticed that. I was waiting for it. 




 I love the opening. Animations are great, and the music is fantastic. I don't know what it is saying, but I like it. Hopefully it won't be shit when done in English. 




 Haha ya man 




 mass adoption of fully electric cars is 10-20 years away at best - and it's very possible that it will never even come close to full adoption at all. 




 Why don't you quote the times to prove your point? you haven't quoted shit. Oh the one thing you quote, is what? A quote from Leonhardt saying they are 'bias towards work'? Like that means anything in our discussion? 

Fox could say, "Were not biased. We just care about American values". But we all know they are biased as hell.

Here is evidence of their anti-israel bias - something you only see from liberals:

[here](http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/11/14/new-york-times-anti-israel-bias-confirmed-in-numbers-says-watchdog/)

And that ridiculous story that even Jon Stewart called out the NYT for - [About Rubio's traffic tickets, and large windows](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/jon-stewart-savages-new-york-times-reporting-on-marco-rubios-finances-118867.html)

From Arthur Brisbane, admitting NYT is progressive [Across the papers many departments, though, so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism  for lack of a better term  that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/success-and-risk-as-the-times-transforms.html?pagewanted=all)

"As a result, developments like the Occupy movement and gay marriage seem almost to erupt in The Times, overloved and undermanaged, more like causes than news subjects."

From an editor of the Times. I think I've proved my point.
 




 Quite stupid to be comparing the 99% vs. the 1%, and then to compare absolute values instead of percentages. 

Say that the bottom 20% income earners have their tax increased by 1.5%, while the top 20% have their tax decreased by 1.9%. That is more accurate. 




 Well you have given no evidence that it is NOT liberal, whereas I have given you evidence that it IS liberal. And considering they themselves admit they are liberal - honestly I'm not sure if you are trolling or not. No one pretends like they are moderate. CNN at least tries. NYT does not.

You're telling me the newspaper that has Krugman as an author is unbiased? Be real. Be intellectually honest. 

No but really, what shred of evidence do you have besides "NYT is pro-American" (which doesn't prove your point, nor is it a fact, it's just a purely subjective opinion with no basis). At this point, I'm treating you like a troll.
