 also i need a name for the disputed territory because i think im going to make it a country 




 btw which one is the french name, you're right on all the others 




 yeah maybe you could feel vibrations from things behind you and around corners 




 you'd be correct, i love that show 




 my idea is that the other countries took the land from chaiardi after they did something and nobody can agree on who owns what land 




 thats a good point about the map perspective but my idea is that chaiardi did something to the other countries took land from them and none of the agree on who owns what land 




 my thoughts were that the disputed land belonged to chaiardi but then they did something and the other countries took their land, but none of them can agree on what land is whos

im also not very good at naming things 




 because im not good at borders, or naming things for that matter 




 as in what? its mean just to be a country border map 









 Thats the point, its just a county outline map, no trees or mountains on it. 




 I guess to me that area looks kinda dull, and id like to liven it up a bit. 




 It's all about the TECHNIQUE.
