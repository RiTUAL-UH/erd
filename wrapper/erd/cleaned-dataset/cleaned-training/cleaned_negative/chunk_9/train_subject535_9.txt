 Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer.

  There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

 but you already know thats not true by the number of rats used. why do you misinform people so much while claiming to be a champion of science?
  
It was neither a chronic toxicity study due to the duration and number of rats that where used. His study differed more from a chronic toxicity study then it did for a carcinogencity study. 
  
again, you already know he modelled the test after monsantos. 
  
No he didn't, duration was way too long and sample size was way to small to be able to gain any meaningful data. Monsanto looked at sub chronic toxicity and Seralini just through shit at the wall and hoped something stuck. 
  
if he use wistar rats like many other carcinogenity studies amd presented tumors as evidence you might
  
Wistar and SD rats are both commonly used for testing either toxicity or carcinogencity. 
  
And he did in fact present his findings on tumor prevalence as evidence against both glyphosate and GMO feed [despite not running any statistical analysis](http://i.imgur.com/F3MtjXB.png), maybe you should actually read the paper?
  
Suffering inducing euthanasia and deaths corresponded mostly
in females to the development of large mammary tumors. These
appeared to be clearly related to the various treatments when
compared to the control groups. These tumors are generally known
to be mostly estrogen-dependent (Harvell et al., 2000). We observed
a strikingly marked induction of mammary tumors by R
alone, a major formulated pesticide, even at the very lowest dose
administered
  
...
  
  
Interestingly, in the groups of animals fed with the NK603 without
R application, similar effects with respect to enhanced tumor
incidence and mortality rates were observed. 
  

 




 Tumor prevalence was a major finding of his study and any toxicologist worth his shit would be aware of the rate of spontaneous tumors in SD rats when taken out to 18+ months. Again, there is little reason anyone would run a rat study with SD rats out to 2 years unless you were looking for carcinogencity. Chronic toxicity is usually 1 year at 20 rats per sex per group (OECD 452). Seralini didn't not follow protocol for any international recognized toxicity study, his protocol and how he reported his findings most matched a carcinogencity trial. 
  
The only person misinformed is you and your pestering that Seralini's study actually means anything in terms of GMO safety. There is a reason why the study was retracted and many health and safety boards published their own independent reviews citing faults and errors in it.

The retraction was over the fact that do to the small sample size of 10 rats per sex per group and 2 year duration of the study it was physically unable to draw meaning conclusion on either general toxicology or carcinogenicity.

Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines.

EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments.

 The reason is that most of our fleet is aging and will require replacement in the near future. There was a decision made to consolidate a lot of the R D with using the same airframe and design.

 THC has some medicinal values, it's just unknown since it's still highly illegal to research it in the USA
  
Not quite true, there have been several clinical studies looking into the effectiveness of THC as a medical drug, see dronabinol.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 Does anyone have any quantifiable source that supports the notion that beats headphones are subpar for their price?  




 Because you are too lazy to post it, this was your comment on that thread. 
  
Why do you think we are interested in what you have to say?
This AMA is one of the most pointless AMA reddit ever produced, because it will be essentially the conversation between Monsanto and its shills.

Then you spend the rest of your time calling everyone a Shill, frankly I'm not surprised that you got banned.

 Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer. In light of the widespread use of marijuana, especially among adolescents and young adults, our study provides important data for informing the risk-benefit calculus of marijuana smoking in medical, public-health, and drug-policy settings.

  There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

 There is actually some paper work involved but basically yes. Many famous fruits such as the Honey Crisp apple the the Haas Avocado have either been granted patents or plant variety protection certificates.  




 GMOs are not actually clones like the say banana are. For GE crops the original GE trait such as insect resistance or herbicide tolerance is crossed back into conventional plant varieties.  




 They've gotten bigger rounder, and redder, sure, but they're also watery and less sweet.
  
There currently are not genetically engineered tomatoes on the market. What you are seeing is a result of classical breeding techniques and this is the unfortunate consequence that "pretty" fruits and veggies sell better then "ugly" ones at the market.
