 This is Amy.  I have launched a couple of new ventures and it often takes longer than you expect to secure revenue. It is obviously best to be revenue positive from day one!!  Some ventures do start that way.  Through my research I can say that the vast majority of successful entrepreneurs test their new businesses as "side-projects" while holding down a full time job.  They experiment in low risk ways before quitting a job or investing significant time or capital.  Good luck!   




 This is Amy.  To the question of textiles, there are great examples in The Creator's Code of retailers who are making products in the United States.  Under Armour founder Kevin Plank, for example, wants to bring all UA jobs back into Baltimore where his company is based.  Spanx founder Sara Blakely launched her company in the southeast by going door-to-door to get a manufacturer to make her product.   

I do see this industry growing in the US through new fabrics as well as wearable technologies.  

In terms of smaller businesses partnering with larger companies, this is one of the best ways to scale a startup.  Any time an entrepreneur can find a larger partner who will be a collaborative customer, the odds of success improve dramatically! 
  




 This is Amy.  On your first question 1) I would recommend reading Zero to One by Peter Thiel.  It is a solid entrepreneurship book written by one of the great Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.  There is also solid research around curiosity by George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon that I would recommend!   

On your second question 2) I would say that love of people and ideas is what fuels my research.  Curiosity is also a big part of it for me - and for the 200 entrepreneurs I interviewed for my book.  When you love your work, it is easier to stay motivated and to take the setbacks that inevitably arise along the path to success.  Good luck!
