 White People 




 I literally can't believe you would say that. Chris Traeger would be disappointed. 




 Holy shit. It happened. It FUCKING HAPPENED 









 The sweetest post of all time.  




 Stress relief part 1   2 were possibly two of the best episodes of The Office.  




 I was at Disney World when I was six years old. We were riding the bus back to our hotel when my mom gave her seat up to a girl about the same age as me. We kept looking at each other and just smiled and laughed. It was so innocent and for my six year old self it was the best thing ever.  




 I've always wanted to have a day like this, but it hasn't happened yet. Sorry to hear about the bitter ending!
