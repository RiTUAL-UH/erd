 The main problem is when people have wood houses in tornado areas. The house turns into a mass of 200mph javelins with nails as the shrapnel. Doctors who have treated in tornado and hurricane disaster zones say building material impalements cause the most injuries and the worst injuries. 




 Here is the tin hat theory that actually makes sense: 

The 1%'rs plan is to make billion$ by denying the problem- letting global warming naturally eradicate billions (worthless eaters) before the biosphere completely crashes. When the world population drops, the CO2 drops, the 1%'rs progeny can live as kings in their little paradise.

This would explain:

1. Sudden, strict 'austerity' measures in the EU.

2. The insane rush to drill baby drill.

3. 1st world police suddenly becoming militant and militarized. 

4. Zero action being taken for mitigation of future known disasters, (sea levies   walls, desalination plants, etc.)

5. Politicians becoming much more corporate/elitist friendly (as a future survival tactic).

And a host of others. 




 If we get [to 5.6F \(3C\),](http://americablog.com/2012/12/world-temperature-increase-climate-change.html) theres no stopping the rest of the increase, since we will have lost control of the process. The process will end when human numbers and human industrial activity are so low that no further increase is possible.

6C is a global mass extinction event.  




 What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow

And the dry stone no sound of water. Only	 

There is shadow under this red rock,

Your shadow at morning striding behind you	 

Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;

 Georgia suffered (along with the rest of the midwest-midsouth) from a stalled weather system last winter. Reason for the stalled weather systems happening everywhere now? Right here: 
https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU

These stalled systems are responsible for most of the disastrous weather we have been seeing since 2010 or so, including the Russian - Northern EU heat wave and the CA Drought.

 And you never grew up with a great-grandmother and her friends talking about Germany- right before they fled in the late 1930's. Or her Russian friend who escaped Russia talking about the restrictions on freedom that came just prior to the curtain dropping. 

Meanwhile we had hundreds of citizens get pulled over for no reason- cell phone contents downloaded and ZERO DUI arrests.

And over two counties we had one single death (driver) rollover and a head on with injuries - one driver drunk. The 'dui' checkpoint didn't prevent either.  




 Actually we have been at a nil El Nino for some time- it is just now growing. We have a stalled high pressure system because of an anomalously looping Jet Stream that is just sitting there. 

Here is the reason for the stalled weather patterns that have been generating long term, horrific droughts in some places and floods in others:

The John Birch Society was formed to bring Mussolini style Corporo Fascism to the US by killing the Labor movement, unions, human rights, health care, welfare, etc. It now appears to be turning into a world-wide movement. In Europe it is called 'Austerity' programs.

 They are under a high pressure system that has been sitting in place for weeks under a super high loop in the Jet Stream. The rains are following that loop north over the west- then dropping down past your area and drowning the midwest.

This is the underlying cause: https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU

 Incline Villagers are new money people who supposedly come here to be closer to nature. Especially since, with climate change, it's so hot in the CA or NV Valleys.

These people are so arrogant that they literally have made a patrol organization at Incline Village that uses dogs and flash bangs to eradicate their beach of the Canadian Geese who have been using Tahoe Lake as a migratory resting layover for thousands of years. The shallow beach waters also provide a critical food source, especially now that most of the other waterways are dried up.

I have never been bothered by their occasional droppings on any other beach in Tahoe. We look forward to seeing them every year and it's an expected part of actually *being in* nature. But Incline Village residents think they are so special that they are willing to disrupt part of a life cycle of an incredibly important wildlife element so they don't have to see a little bird poo on the beach. 

Worse, they are using the Park Service (taxpayer money) to do this on beaches they have privatized by residential / fee.

I know this is a small element to a much larger problem- but I just found out about this and it really irritates me.

 Samples: Banks foreclosing then taking over properties and using them for vacation or long term rentals instead of established owners.

Banks foreclosing or buying out owners of retail properties that were renting to local owned businesses at a normal price- then jacking the rent to ridiculous corporate rates and killing all of the cool little small businesses in favor of multinational/corporate establishment invaders.

These same corporate moneyed interests (starts with V, H and W in SLT) changing plans to widen 50 so that it doesn't touch their hotels but instead will run right through at least 6 small family owned hotels, effectively killing their businesses.

What this means is that most of this 'tax revenue' is going to leave the local area to corporate banks and tax shelters instead of being recycled through the community economy. And it will fuck an economy. 




 He is right- there is a 16% rise in tourists. Unfortunately they are all staying down in the Heavenly area in SLT and most of the local businesses are closed because of the banks (who I am sure are facilitating Vail) have raised rents on retail properties to astronomical rates on top of bad snow seasons couple years in a row. 

Of course this means the tourists will be dropping money on a company that will immediately take it outside of the area.  




 A trend of moneyed interests have moved in and are screwing things up.

 I cannot agree with you more. Subs that are too quick to down vote posts due to silly or inexplicable reasons will start losing folks faster than they gain them. Not only that but they end up being seen as hostile territory. 

Quick example, I found this article that included a very interesting video by Nasa that showed, from space, burning space junk that lit up areas of Tennessee and other parts of the mid southern US. The video was gorgeous and the American Meteorological Society provided a map of incoming calls/reports on the flashes of light.

I submitted it to /r/space and within just a minute it was down-voted. Why? No clue. It was very off-putting though and I would probably never submit to /r/space again. That's pretty bad because I have been linked to them from my sub for over a year.

 That's a reverse google translate for "But you are cooler now than the UK."

Maybe it is too early for comedy. :D 




 Il est trop putain de chaud! Mais vous tes plus basses aujourd'hui au Royaume-Uni 




 Nope. 6/2/15 was the first 80 degree flush of warm surface waters up into that region. And then just at northern border is this upwelling of very hot water from below the surface (the anomaly pic) that has been sort of 'wrapping' down in sort of a semi circle around the NC coast. That's been there for a while. So I am not sure if the guy is referring to surface temps or subsurface temps.

I just know the whole thing is around +5 degrees warmer than usual, generating a sort of shark cafe that young Bullsharks would flock to.

I lived near a pier that went out into very shallow water right next to a warm water ejection flow from a power generation station. I would take the kids to the pier to crab at low tide. The guys at the end of the pier would catch Bullsharks all night. Dozens of them. Of all of the fishing piers I hung out on this is the only one where I saw this level of shark activity.

That was what made me go look for warm water up-welling or currents when we got to our third attack. 




 you find out that 80 degree water (26.6 C) did not show up in lower NC until June.

June is when these attacks started, right about the time the heat anomaly began:
 
http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/2015/anomw.6.22.2015.gif 

See the dark red spot off the east coast? That heat anomaly has been there for a month now. Bull sharks (and their prey) typically love warmer water and normally hang around the edges of the warm Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is closer to the coastline around Florida   farther off the coast on the eastern seaboard. Hence more shark attacks (normally) in Florida than NC. 

Fishermen on the original post I made on this sub (at attack 7) are in agreement.  




 Definitely more than normal.  




 Please see my post at:

https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/3bilr3/7th_shark_attack_off_north_carolina_2_more_over/

I'll show you what is most likely the issue right here:

Right now I am sure they are coming up to that area of heat and playing / massing around the southern edge of it, which would be the N Carolina coastline.


 




 And now we are up to 8. http://www.wbtv.com/story/29453751/report-another-shark-incident-in-outer-banks-3rd-in-week 




 That's the 8th Victim in less than a month. I was kind of confused by the Title as it attempts to seem as if there have only been 3 attacks. I suppose NC is probably worried about those holiday tourist dollars.

 What I tell Christians. And they can't argue it.

God gave humans two gifts- Life and Free Will.

Without free will there is no sin because people lose the choice to sin or not.

When you legislate morality you are taking away that free will. You are taking away a gift that God gave human-kind. You are sinning then, by doing so.  




 Oui 




 You completely missed my point. Whoosh. 

Casual play has always been a part of the game. I am more casual now. Nothing wrong with that. Point being that the game should not be focused 99% of the casuals and it needs enriched by giving people some choice back instead of running people through these stockyard fences like they are all idiots and need to be hand-held through out the game. 

It's dumbed down to the point that it is boring.  




 I started playing when I was 40. Became GL when I was 41. It's 10 yrs later. Still playing. 




 Gotcha. 




 See this [chart of subscription numbers](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/)? 

Note how they start dropping in 2010. This is when Blizzard started catering to 'casual players' by introducing LFD/LFR.

'Casual players' are going to be the death of this game. You play Massive *Multiplayer* games in order to play with other people. Otherwise it could be called a 'Casual Solo game'. 

Now - what is your definition of 'Casual'? Is it time based? Because our guild ran attunement quest and dungeon runs for incoming players several times a week, according to peoples needs and did 2 raids a week, split between 2, 40 man raid groups . If you don't have time to play 2-3 times a week- find another game. 

Or is your definition of 'Casual' meaning you lack of motivation to gain basic skills?

Or maybe it's that you like to play solo. That's simply a personal choice on your part and shouldn't impact how the game is designed for the rest of us. Skyrim is waiting for you. 

The thing about 'Casual' gamers is that they make no associations in the game- no friends to speak of and therefore will jump ship without even thinking about it once they become a little bored.

Serious MMO players have long term associations and friends and won't unsub out of boredom or temporary set backs. 

Why has Wod dropped millions of subs? Because the casual players are bored. It's that simple. I can guarantee that the people still playing are those with associations in the game or old timers hoping blizz will get a clue and get the game back on track.

Yes, let's get back to the way things were- back when there were 12 million people happily playing the game and re-subbing every month. You have a problem with that? Because I don't.

We weren't doing simple, mind numbing repeatable grinds in Vanilla. 

Huge, huge difference. 

We would go on difficult missions and epic quests to get, for example,  the Key (Seal of Ascension) for UBRS. And it made sense, because in doing BRD for the Gems to make the Seal you would be getting Fire Resist gear and patterns that you needed eventually for MC. In addition, you were skilling up your toon and getting raid ready.

For us players it was like getting in shape for a marathon run, but a lot more exciting. We never saw it as gating- it was a series of adventures that you did *on your own timetable*. Best of all, they made perfect sense in leading through progression. 




 I read an article not long ago that was attempting to explain the reasons behind the drop off of wow players starting in 2010. The main conclusion of 'Professional Game Advisors' is that was when Facebook style games on handhelds became popular.

Seems like blizzard/activision honchos drank that koolaid instead of asking the players what the problem was - or actually checking their own forums. Of course it's an 'easy out' to think that your customers are just playing these UI games now rather than accept you fucked your game up, admit to it and make corrections. 

Instead they thought that they could make Wow a big Facebook game and everyone would flock back. This just tells me that people in positions of power can be really, really stupid. 









 I dont agree with them scaling back anything once it's introduced, for anyone. But if they are worried about gold farmers running hundreds of garrisoned alts- then what I recommended above is what they should do. 




 Since /u/gereth is a helluva mod -it can certainly pass. We do post storm warnings and other types of warnings- and have helped people; from some of the messages I have received, so no biggie. We are pretty relaxed 'round here. Main pet peeves being posted in the sticky.  


































 Exactly what I came in to say. Dump the circle.  




 This is gorgeous work. I really feel that people are becoming sick and tired of the 'minimalist' trend and want to see something more rich, touchable and layered in their environment. Architecture firms and interior designers are still pushing minimalism because it's inexpensive and done so much the plans are just re-used.

But I was just recently contracted for [some work](http://i.imgur.com/PzpAK9t.jpg) and I see more of this on the horizon. I say go for it.  




 How hard would it to be to scale back the amount of G per mission in accordance with the number of active garrisoned alts per account? It's math. Math translates to code. It's not that hard.

Instead of whacking everyone- including those of us with just a few alts- go after the gold hoarders. 

And as soon as an element such as shipyards starts looking like a gold / time sink via gating- I'm done.

Edit- you should post this to bliz forum. 




 Thank you very much. The Joplin Globe reporters and employees are real heroes in my eyes. I read quite a bit about how reporters stayed at their posts, not even knowing if their homes were destroyed- and the follow up work you did was amazing.  




 That's a great video. Where were you when it was happening?

edit: just finished it- I take that back. That is a fucking amazing video. The bravery of those involved- firefighters and videographer - was just amazing.

Instead of just saying "It's a propaganda outlet." PROVE the stories linked are wrong. Otherwise your statement has no meaning whatsoever. 




 If you had public utilities still, you could have voted the guy out. Once privatized- you can't touch them. And you will never be able to vote on a rate hike again, or see their budgets, or internal safety reports. You lost infrastructure that your grandparents and great grandparents built for you to some slimy little corporate ceo to make millions from.  




 Then it should have been happening since fishermen used the pier the first time- decades ago.  




 At the bottom of this article http://maptd.com/joplin-tornado-before-and-after/ 

is a link to a KML file to use with Google Earth to see Joplin immediately after the tornado and compare it to 'before'. This is probably the best mapped area that I have seen. You can then use the 'calendar' tool on Google Earth to see it in 2015. 

One striking thing, and I think a constant, painful reminder for residents, is the tree destruction. I am wondering about the psychological impact of this.  




 As we go into the 'new' fire season (used to be in late summer to fall) and things are heightening, here is an active fire map that is constantly updated. Please bookmark for use- especially if you live in the West.

 I have been curious and using Google Earth extensively, to look at areas before and after extreme tornado disasters.

In most cases I have seen a lot of empty lots, driveways that go nowhere being overcome with grass, dead tree stalks, empty parking lots with bits of rubble around the edges.

For all of the 'Rebuild- its the American way!' and "Coming back Strong!" that starts shortly after the dead have been counted, it seems that these places either take a long, long time to come back or perhaps never really do. 

Is anyone familiar with any studies that have been done on this? What are your thoughts on it?

 Great explanation - thank you!

And I just saw that N.Carolina is offering free fishing in all public inland and coastal waters on the 4th of July.

Which means lots of bait   blood in the water on the coast combined with 3x the number of people. 

Hope this doesn't turn into one of those "What were they thinking?!" moments.

 









 Holding my breath through the entire thing. If this were a tornado it would be an EF6.  









 And as humans are the next 'dinosaurs' we have a clue as to the future without us. 




 Interesting that another person (in comments) got video the same thing. No clue what it could be. 




 That's a dream team right there. 




 Imagine if old horse and buggy makers had a massive lobby power back when cars started becoming popular. 

They would have been passing laws left and right: No driving cars on Sunday, only 2 gallons of gas allowed per week, stipend taxes paid to the Buggy Industry, etc.

These Utilities are going the way of the Dinosaur- passing laws right and left to keep you on the teat as long as they can. Too damn bad we privatized them and made this a for-profit industry. In places that the public still owns their own utility you don't see crap like this, because the public decides these things.

Hopefully in a generation people will be running their own personal power locally off of locally manufactured renewables (jobs and energy) and can tell these guys to take a hike. 




 I hope to hell NC is able to stop more US dollars from going offshore via this whack ass plan. That money needs to stay in NC and the US to help bolster local economies- not the bank accounts of spanish fat cats.

Have NC politicians completely lost their minds? At the very least this is a violation of their oath of office to be loyal to the State and the People of the State.  




 Me too.

 "Here's to swimming with bow-legged women." 




 Just stay away from women on their periods or children with cuts on their knees (99.9% of the child population on earth) and you will be just fine. 




 Corporate can pressure their franchise owners to change their business practices- especially if they are making the whole franchise look bad- which this is.  




 During this time period- this was the alert that was broadcast:

ALERT ---- SHELTER IN PLACE ----- AMMONIA LEAK
up to 1/2 mile South of the Bluebird Facility in Wenatchee ........monitor your tv or radio for further. Go indoors, shut windows and doors, shut off air conditioning, and move to the inner most room to get away from the windows.
SHELTER IN PLACE....NOW

That Bluebird place that was on fire was only a few blocks away from the Sonic. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/3bjefv/wenatchee_wash_fire_update_ammonia_leak_from/ 




 Everything from chumming to women going in on their periods to erratic splashing can draw sharks. 




  http://www.reddit.com/r/Washington/comments/3bj3ec/sonic_employees_in_wenatchee_fired_for_closing/


Yep and their boss needs fired and they need re-instated. What he or she did was against the law.
 









 I loved this story and this cat. I'm not even going to tell my husband because I know it will ruin his day. 




 If you know anyone in Wenatchee make sure they are alerted to this.

 Note that the NC Politicians are treating it the same too. Oh no.. we can't close the beaches to those tourist dollars! 




 Yes- I posted the text from this on /r/northcarolina and a fisherman replied that this is exactly what the problem is.

 I am really concerned about the 4th of July weekend. That hot mass shows no sign of dissipating, it seems to be getting larger. I'll be keeping an eye on it. 









 Armageddon? Not sure, kind of looking like it though. Check /r/StormComing for the list.  









 The reason for the existence of this sub is the fact that starting about 6 years ago I witnessed the Jet Stream and resulting weather patterns perform more anomalous feats than in my previous 40 years of extreme weather studies. Others were noticing too, and the data was verifying it. Not only that, but the [massive increase in damage to people and infrastructure started being noted.](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/docs/smith-and-katz-2013.pdf) 

Then in 2012 Rutgers and University of Japan did a study as to why was the Jet Stream running in these anomalous patterns, slowing, stalling, generating long term droughts and record rainfalls, etc. 

Here is a [small video explaining the results.](https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU) The published paper has stood the test of time and become even more recognized. 

And [here is the publication](http://marine.rutgers.edu/~francis/pres/Francis_Vavrus_2012GL051000_pub.pdf) if you want to dig deeper.

 And now we [are up to 7 attacks](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/29/three-new-shark-attacks-in-carolinas-puzzle-experts-and-scare-beachgoers/). And I see a lot of floundering out there as to 'why'. Pier fishing (been going on for decades) more people (Carolinas has had a drop off in tourism, though) blah blah blah. 

I'll show you what is most likely the issue right here: 

http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/2015/anomw.6.22.2015.gif

See the dark red spot off the east coast?  That heat anomaly has been there for a month now. Bull sharks (and their prey) typically love warmer water and normally hang around the edges of the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is closer to the coastline around Florida   farther off the coast on the eastern seaboard. Hence more attacks (normally) in Florida.

Right now I am sure they are coming up to that area of heat and feeding / massing around the southern edge of it, which would be the N Carolina coastline. Y'all are collateral damage.

I posted this to /r/StormComing earlier and thought it would be helpful here.

 She is an NE with engineering - so I already have a lot of goggles. Right now she is sporting the Decaying Herbalist robe ([deep earth set](http://wowimg.zamimg.com/images/transmogsets/big/1212.jpg)) with the shoulders and it looks great- but I have been looking for something else. 




 This is a great mog. And you just gave me an idea for my druid who is sporting the storm riders- same model as the passive resistor spaulders. 




 I logged on after patch- figured out that master plan wasn't working - it hadn't been updated. Didn't bother to log back on until it was updated.

That's how fucking bad it is playing Garrisonville without it. 




  But sheep aren't beholden to the rules of so-called civilized society, and they are happier for it.

Sheep go about eating, shitting and fucking without a care in the world..
