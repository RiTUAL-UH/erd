 Pretty sure it's going to happen to me when I go for red...Lol 




 You were never meant to be a member of the one pure race. 




 It saddens me that you try to justify your sinful behavior.  You purples are all the same. 




 Sinner 




 Typical self-centered, narcissistic purple. Think you're better than everyone. 

Purples are just bitter because they can't read. They see something shiny and get distracted. They see a button and push it without any care for the repercussions. You're just upset that you didn't become a blue our have the willpower to use your press for good...

You disgust me... *spits at ground* 




 Real hero's don't seek the glory. They perform their heroic deeds without any recognition. 




 When the time comes, I will end my greyness and fall on my sword to defend the button. Long live the button.  




 Grey pride! 




 How am I supposed to explain to my kid that he has two grey's? 




 It's The Button.... some things just can't be understood.
 




 not very grey like if you ask me.....
 




 Need moar commas!

 Do you feel reborn? do you feel like life gave you a second chance for giving into temptation?

 Those who have pushed the button but are still here....

Are you sad you pushed the button so early?
Do you find yourself clicking in the spot the button was previously?
Do you feel like a shell of your former self?

Please share your thoughts 




 It's a trap
