 Don't own Ghosts, but it bares a resemblance. I was inspired by Mw3 Dome more :) 




 You were clear about one screenshot from one map that I shown that isn't even released yet.
However, it's pretty stupid to judge someone's mapping skills by one screenshot, don't you think? I've done a LOT of work in the past, and I was just testing the waters. Apparently Reddit didn't like it, so I scrapped the map and turned it into a humorous gag. 
Here's some of my work:
[Example 1](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34115979016804076/7FAA6125BCEF7B5BB45DFF6EE9AAF9107E6BBD54/)
[Example 2](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34113070265576771/90A117932CA5ECBB232624153CE3FE6C67629BE9/)
[Example 3](http://cloud-2.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34114798216970247/2EE3EE18986D966221D45B5CEA9BBAB7726856A8/)
[Example 4](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34112262285228426/DE20B2E78E41A43FA98587544F48FCB9AA806AE2/)
[Example 5](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34111542962174107/A448F2491A5E15FA4A4900A291109F12E2387E13/)
 




 oh, so youre saying my map has already been done? with the boilers? damn..
i need to make a new map with boiler as a skybox... hopefully that'll work.. 




 do you like sea salt or normal salt? i like cooking salt 




 i am a mad map maker. like a mad scientist. one day me and my chikens will take over the world, and hopefuly that day will be soon 




 no, i am completely fine with criticism. pros told me to add chikens, so i did 




 then i hope lens flares wont be a problem 




 i agree 




 it lacked boilers, it shouldnt be a problem anymore 




 this map is epidomy of all the best maps combined, its like a frankenstein. i have teamed up with fnatic to add some boost spots for the next major

 




 oh crap i must add more boilers and lens flares then, thanks 




 im not mad at all, this new map is actually going to be amazing 




 no, im reeking that sweet Reddit karma. you were wrong all along 




 i am completely serious 




 i know right? i will be adding more lens flares and making bombsites on top of eachother. i will also make the ct and t spawns directly in front of each other as well.
overpass is going to be left in shadows after this map is finished 




 it is very functional, it has Advanced Chiken and Fish AI.
i have also added next-gen skybox for the best experience.
angles shouldnt be a problem, pros told me that having ct spawn directly in front of t spawn would help the gameplay and balance, early gunfights would be interesting and engaging 




 yes i am trying my best 









 Okay I agree with you. Anyone who will want to play the map will be able to play it from Steam workshop. 




 Can you show some examples of your work?
Also, it doesn't have to be special.
It has to be simple and it has to work, which in this case it does 




 Map maker =/= artist

You can make maps but have someone else make the assets for you. I made my own assets for this map either way, and taking a theme is not stealing. It's the same as saying Dust2 stole every other games Arabic/Dusty environment. 




 Will be fixed 




 It'll be fixed 




 You say it looks terrible, but you don't provide feedback why?
If you could change it up so it looks better, what would you change? 




 I'll try fixing some angles. The round areas are only in the middle. 




 Noone said it's going to be added to an Operation. The map isn't even released yet.

Also, I'm not aiming for an operation. 




 Please come back to me when you make ANY map and tell me how easy it is just to recreate this ONE scene from the screenshot. Like I said before, every credit will be given. 




 It will be in the game automatically once I add it to the workshop. It might not be in operation, is what you are saying. And thats perfectly fine. I am not making it just so it gets into operation, I am making so it can be added to servers and me and my friends would enjoy it.  




 Cant change the title either way. Credits will be in the workshop page, just like I do with my other maps. People in general are very unacceptive to change, which is quite disappointing from mappers point of view. 




 Who said I won't give credit? It's just a preview screenshot 




 AKA RIP warehouse maps? 




 I can use brick textures any time lol 




 Okay, I'll see you when I get sued. 




 Yup, the fishes do have Advanced Next Gen Fish AI 




 It's a custom map that is work in progress. 




 ^ 




 I wont use that ridiculous layout, that's the difference. 




 I remember CS:GO Beta when everyone said that Dust2 looked like COD haha 




 What looks hidious? Elaborate pls 




 A map 




 Yeah, except I'll use my own layout and implement theme and design choices that fit CS:GO. It's going to be up on workshop, if you won't like it you won' need to play it. I'm sure some casual servers will find use of it. 




 What exactly looks bad? Give me feedback so I can improve it, just saying it's bad doesn't help it. 




 I will try adding variation. Thank you for your opinion.
 




 It's just not interesting to work on warehouse themes anymore. Compare the original Mirage and the current one. 




 They haven't copyrighted the theme. I'm using my own assets and I'l try to change the map so it isn't exactly the same. Layout is completely different. And yes, I have done many original maps of my own.  




 Theme - yes, layout - no. 




 Yes, it's inspired by COD AW greenband. But the layout is not even close to be the same, it's just the theme of the map only. I thought it would look interesting in CS:GO and steer away from the usual "warehouse" style. There are many COD inspired maps in CS:GO, however, it would be stupid to use COD's layouts. If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know. I am working on quite a bunch of maps that don't employ "COD maps" style, so if people don't like this map I can just scrap it any time.

 What did you say? More music kits? 




 [Already working on something interesting ;)](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34116492237229707/0E1FB9BEEB732708D35DD6175C9FA7678ABCC72F/) 




 Unfortunately, maps like these look good but they are simply decompiled official versions with light/environment conditions changed. It would be stupid to add these maps over custom maps like de_zoo, de_resort as there is a monetary incentive and people actually put a lot of effort into making custom maps.
 




 [Pfft, I've done it better](https://gfycat.com/DelayedArtisticGuppy) 









 Indeed, Westwood could work with addition of a second bombsite. 




 I am looking for classic mode maps that could potentially be played in competitive environment (de, cs). 




 I would love it too, however, I do not know how to code such gamemode.
On the other hand, I can make old maps see the light again! 




 The map had horrible choke points. Please.

EDIT: I can change layouts to be more competitive, but not if the map needs complete overhaul. 




 Hello!
I'm a map maker, and I've done some original layouts myself in the past. However, this time I'm quite stuck.

I remember playing 1.6, but most of my experience was public and surf servers and I never used to care on what maps I was playing on, it was plain fun that I cared about.

Which 1.6/css maps would you like to see remade in CS:GO that have not yet been remade? I am looking for layout specific feedback, and not "nostalgia" driven maps.
Maps that had very good/competitive layouts but haven't made to CS:GO yet.

Here are some screenshots of my work -

Thank you for any of your feedback! 




 Holy crap that's a cool HUD! How do you do it? 




 EXITING APPS EXITING APPS! Don't kill me... 




 As a mapper, there are many common mistakes.
There are a lot of floaters (floating props, not aligned with the floor).
Nodraw textures visible without boosts.
Clipping is also bad, especially when you are 1 meter away from an obstacle and get magically blocked by the air. Clipping is basically adding invisible brushes (walls for nonmappers) so players can't access certain areas.
The custom textures are terrible. With today's standards, it's not that hard to add reflectivity (normal maps) to the textures and $detail annotation.
For that you would need to import texture to VTFEdit and export it as ENV file with normal maps generated, as easy as that. The rest is editing VMT file with notepad. He could also just simply add a line $detail wood and it would instantly make all his textures look 10x better.
Lastly, the map could be simplified. In CS:GO, maps don't look better if you spam trash props (clutter) over the map to make it better. It doesn't make it better by adding more window frames and pipes either. What makes a map good is the general simplicity of it, take an example of DE_SEASON. It is simple, utilizes reflective materials. Tuscan is very sharp as a map, more rounded edges would seperate it from CSS and CS 1.6. Take Toscan for example, noticed how it's more "round" than Tuscan? It allows for better smooth lighting.
He could also use vertigoblue_hdr or one of the default skyboxes instead of the one he uses right now, he just adds additional materials to pack to the file size.

"Engine capacity" is an old excuse, maps can look good and work well.
 




 Although I agree with you myself as a mapper, Tuscan theme is a classic and I doubt it should be changed.

The name Tuscan wouldn't make much sense in a map set in underground tunnels for example, would it? ;) 




 It's not just because of the map visuals, from the first looks I can already tell the map is untidy. Especially from the mapping standpoint.
Many common mapping mistakes are also abundant. 




 Wasn't it released like 5 times or something..?

 Hey guys, can I join the par....
