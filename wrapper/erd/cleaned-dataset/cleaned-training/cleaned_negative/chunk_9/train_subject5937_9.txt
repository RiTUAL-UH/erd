 This is the answer. His crew had to have "acquired" blueprints to be that accurate. And people were "convinced" to keep their mouths shut about what was going on. The convincing probably ranged from payments, to showing a guard a picture of his kid playing in his back yard - - you talk and you know what happens. 




 Good! He should be charged. He sounds like a truly awful person. 

 An Ohio man was charged on Wednesday for entering a vehicle after an accident where he filmed two injured teenagers, one of whom later died, while calling them idiots and making no effort to help them, police said. Paul Pelton, 41, was charged with vehicular trespass after he opened a back door and leaned into the vehicle to capture video on his cellphone

Edit: Why the down votes? He didn't try to help, didn't even call 911, recorded people dying by entering their car, and tried to sell the video. Sounds like a horrible human to me. 




 Prior to 1970, votes in Congress were anonymous (like citizens votes are) both in committees and on the floor. When legislation passed making all votes public, the transparency was seen as a great benefit to constituents. An unintended consequence is that it allowed lobbyists to track votes, and to directly tie donations to votes. In my opinion, this is why lobbying became so powerful in the late '70s and has controlled American politics ever since.  




 "Goose pulling (also called gander pulling, goose riding or pulling the goose) was a blood sport practiced in parts of the Netherlands, Belgium, England and North America from the 17th to the 19th centuries. The sport involved fastening a live goose with a well-greased head to a rope or pole that was stretched across a road. A man riding on horseback at a full gallop would attempt to grab the bird by the neck in order to pull the head off."

"Goose pulling continues to this day as part of traditional Shrove Tuesday celebrations in Grevenbicht in the Netherlands and in parts of Belgium and Germany, **using a dead goose that has been humanely killed** by a veterinarian."

 The World to Hillary   Huffington Post: [Bernie Sanders and a lot of unlikely allies are backing up Jeb Bush about part-time workers](http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-jeb-bush-conservatives-2015-7) (Source: Business Insider)

"If he is talking about the need for more full-time jobs than part time jobs, that's absolutely correct," Sanders said.

The flap came after Bush proposed increasing economic output by increasing worker participation, helping part-time workers get full-time work and helping Americans who have dropped out of the workforce find jobs. Democrats have tried to use the comments  Bush said growing the economy would require Americans to "work more hours"  to say he's "out of touch."

 Agreed - - Short story.

I was rear ended at highway speed resulting in severe pain but no permanent damage. I attended 2 chiropractors (first time in my life) that really helped me recover. The second one had me do these tests of "lift your hand against mine - oh, good pressure. Now with this bottle of nightshade essence placed against your shoulder, try to lift your hand. Oh wow you can't. See - - you have a problem with nightshade vegetables." (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers ... everything I love) "and I have some medicinals that can help."

ME: Like wow, interesting ... keep working on my back, and I'll look into that nightshade issue and get back to you (yah . . .  the fuck I will).

 The facility was formerly known as New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (**NUMMI**), a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota. On May 20, 2010, Tesla Motors and Toyota announced a partnership to work on electric vehicle development and collaborate on the "development of electric vehicles, parts, and production system and engineering support". This included Tesla's partial purchase of the former NUMMI site, mainly consisting of the factory building, for $42 million. 

Much of the 370-acre (150 ha) site is unused, with most activity concentrated in the 5,500,000-square-foot (510,000 m2) main building that does the final assembly of vehicles.

 I feel that you are channeling Bernie . . .  




 Bernie Sanders position on gun rights and gun safety is nuanced and well thought out (in true Bernie style). 

"*I come from a state where there is virtually no gun control. But the people of my state understand, pretty clearly, that guns in Vermont are not the same thing as guns in Chicago or Los Angeles. In our state, guns are used for hunting. In Chicago they are used for kids killing other kids or gang members shooting at police officers, shooting down innocent people. We need a sensible debate about gun control, which overcomes the cultural divide that exists in this country, and I think I can play an important role in this.*"

If you try to paint him with a broad brush on this issue, you can piss off.

"Only occurs over larges bumps - no I can't test that"

"On steep grades? Sorry mate - not allowed by my insurer."

[THE BLOOD BROKERS - HOW BLOOD, THE 'GIFT OF LIFE,' BECAME A BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS](http://www.bloodbook.com/part-1.html)

Most blood sales take place through clearinghouses operated by the American Red Cross and other nonprofit blood-collecting groups. But there is also a spot market - not unlike the one for oil - where hundreds, possibly thousands, of sales occur each year.

"It functions rather like the NASDAQ," a national system for trading over-the-counter stocks, said Dr. Charles L. Rouault, president of the Broward Community Blood Center near Fort Lauderdale. "You pick up the phone and call somebody you know."

No one - not the federal government, not the blood banks themselves - knows for sure how much blood is bought and sold on the open market. There are no requirements that sales be reported; no government agency keeps track.

 Off the top of my head, here are some basics of investing for retirement:

Tax sheltered retirements accounts vs "savings" account - Definitely use a tax sheltered account. These include IRA, Roth IRA, 401k, etc. That way your earnings grow for decades without being taxed each year.

Dollar cost averaging - simply means that you invest on a regular basis (e.g. weekly, monthly) at what ever the price is on that day. Don't worry about trying to time the market each time you money is invested. The tough decision is what to do when there is a large correction - I'm not even going to get into that now. The point is to invest for the long term.

Diversification - Mutual funds are a great way to go. There are many very good mutual funds that invest across a variety of sectors of the economy, and some funds are global so they invest in different countries as well. Just don't put all your savings into one, or a few stocks. While this can pay off well, it can also create large losses if one of your few stocks tank.

Compounding - I'm sure you are aware of the idea of compound growth (if not - look it up). To me, the most important part of the compounding story is how important it is to start investing NOW. Even if you're not sure what to invest in, just DO SOMETHING. You can look up charts showing how much more you will have at retirement if you simply start saving a few years earlier. So don't put it off.

Risk/reward - this is a tough one. Do your best to understand what you are investing in. If you don't understand an investment (e.g. annuities, REITs, futures, options, etc.) then either pick something else, or do your homework until you do understand it. You need to feel comfortable with the investments to be able to sleep well at night. Some investments are inherently more risky. This is not necessarily bad. Risk should mean greater potential for growth and loss. You need to be comfortable with the "level of risk" of each of your investments.

Financial Planners - I have never used one, but if you do, I recommend a fee-only FP. That means a FP that makes ZERO money off commissions from ANY of the investments. Fee only planners charge you an up-front fee (either a flat fee or a percent of what you have invested each year). That means they aren't compensated by the mutual fund company to steer you into one fund or another simply because they get a higher commission. Commissions can create conflicts of interest. So, I definitely see the value of a FP to help you make a plan, but only if they are fee only.

Wow, I didn't plan ow writing quite that much. Anyhoo . . . good luck, but more importantly, start ASAP. 




 You asked "What is the best way to start planning for retirement".

I would suggest a different approach. Plans change, investments will vary, options depend on many factors.

I advise you both agree to a retirement **commitment**. 

Commit to a percent of your income that will be invested every month and every year for the rest of your lives - - together.

Commit that you will not touch that retirement nest egg EVER until retirement.

For example, if you hit hard times, before you dip into the retirement fund, downsize. Sell stuff. Change jobs. Take on a second job.

If you can commit that you will do this for each other, because you know that you want to provide for your "golden years" together, the rest - - the details - -  will follow.

Walter Huston, John Huston's father, also **won the Academy Award** for Best Supporting Actor for his role in this film, the first father-son win. The film was **nominated for the Best Picture award**, but lost to Laurence Olivier's film adaptation of Hamlet.

In 1990, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "**culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The film was among the first 100 films to be selected**.

Director Stanley Kubrick listed The Treasure of the Sierra Madre as **his 4th favorite film of all time** in his list of his top ten favorite films in a 1963 edition of Cinema magazine. Director Sam Raimi ranked it as **his favorite film of all time** in an interview with Rotten Tomatoes and director Paul Thomas Anderson watched it at night before bed while writing his film There Will Be Blood.

 This 20s movie as you put it was made in 1948 and starred Humphrey Bogart.

It has an IMDB rating of 8.3, and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 100%/critics   93%/audience. 

It is #34 on Rotten Tomatoes list of the [Top 100 movies of all time]( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/)

So yes, a paraphrased quote was used in a 40+ year old movie (Blazing Saddles). It was also used many, many other times. 
 




 The original version of the line appeared in B. Traven's novel The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1927):

- "All right," Curtin shouted back. "If you are the police, where are your badges? Let's see them."
- "Badges, to god-damned hell with badges! We have no badges. In fact, we don't need badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges, you god-damned cabrn and chinga tu madre!"

The line was popularized by John Huston's 1948 film adaptation of the novel, which was bowdlerized to meet Hays Code regulations severely limiting profanity in film. In one scene, a Mexican bandit leader named "Gold Hat" (portrayed by Alfonso Bedoya) tries to convince Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) that he and his company are Federales:

- Dobbs: "If you're the police, then where are your badges?"

- Gold Hat: "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!"

The phrase from the book chinga tu madre translates to "fuck your mother".

Right after 911 I was obsessed with possible terrorist targets near me, so I Googled it over and over . . . biological sights, places with radioactive materials like hospitals, concentrations of poisonous gasses like chlorine gas at water treatment plants, fertilizer manufacturing and storage, etc.

As time went on I noticed that sites were being taken down, so I kept tracking them out of curiosity.

So in a confidential survey, done by the Pew Research Group, true atheists feel the need to lie.

So they have no belief in a higher power, and they lie about it as not to be persecuted?
