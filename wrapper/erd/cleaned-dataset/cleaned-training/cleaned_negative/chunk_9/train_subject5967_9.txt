 Add garlic, trust me. It'll change your life. 




 One of the best things you can do is to fix your body clock. You can do this in 1 day. Set an alarm clock for 7am and no matter how little sleep you get, wake up and don't go back to sleep for the whole day. Do what ever you have to and then go to be at a reasonable hour that night. 

For actually going to sleep, here's some advice:

Turn everything off in your room, computer, TV, everything that has a LED or a humming noise.

Then close your eyes and get comfortable. It's story time! 

Use your imagination, do something. Tell a story, come up with your ideal video game, direct a porno with you and Jessica Alba! Have fun with it, let your mind go. Remember being a kid and having these imagination sessions? There is no reason you can't do it again as an adult.

In fact, several times in doing this I've had epiphanies for work haha. The point is to let your body relax into sleep. Also stop drinking any form of caffeine after 5pm, that one caused massive problems for me for years.

Also it sounds cliche but a good diet and exercise does wonders for how well you sleep. I've been losing weight for the past 4 months and just eating better has given me solid nights sleep, which in turn gives me more energy for exercise when in turn means I'm more tired at night for sleep! It's cyclical! 




 Reach around, feel stick, what do? 




 When I started saying "Man I wish i was single" coupled with a feeling of sadness.

I realised that it wasn't just me whining, I was legitimately unhappy.

Spoiler alert, I felt 1 million times better after I bit the bullet and broke it off. 




 OH

**Transmission sexuality**

Transexual - I get it now. 




 I went bald at 22, accept it and move the fuck on. Keep it short, don't grow it out.

You'd be surprised how little anyone gives a fuck about it. That's especially the case if you don't give a fuck either.

I would even make the move to completely shaved. I've started doing it now and it looks much better. 




 Shaved mine last night and along with fresh sheets I slept like a baby in a field of marshmellows.

 Yeah, it's perfectly fine to be like that but I don't think it requires a word. Same reason why there isn't a word for someone who only sleeps with someone who drives a manual car.

 




 It's not that uncommon, there is actually a title for it but I've not committed it to memory since it appears to me as a rather pretentious and unnecessary special snowflake title. 




 I get what you're saying, I guess it depends on who you're and what your relationship with the person is like. 

 




 That's very interesting, since it's currently only 70% on RT. I was rather shocked by that, how the consensus showed that it was nearly on par with Guardians and that was tracking 90+% on RT. 




 I have the dark circles under my eyes, I can see why someone might think that I'm tired. 

I guess I can see that if you're self conscious about it that it may be an issue, but if the person speaking to you doesn't know about it, it's kinda harmless. I guess following that rule up, you should just completely avoid saying anything about anyones appearance? Just in case what you speak about is a touchy subject? 




 I'm one of those mother fuckers who can drop them incredibly easily. I went from smoking a pack a day for 5 years to quitting cold turkey without thinking about it.

I dunno, just lucky I guess? 




 I disagree! I do 30 minutes of cardio 2-4 times a week and I love it!

That's a 5 minute warm up walk, 20 minute run then a 5 minute cooldown.

It goes by so damn quick, even if you're just listening to music and it feels great!

It also helps if you have a TV show that you can watch on your phone.  




 I've had two wisdom teeth pulled on two separate occasions and I avoided dry sockets, I was so incredibly scared of getting a dry socket that I would spend hours researching horror stories about it.

It ended up just making me more scared, just follow the dentist's instructions guys and you'll be fine. 




 I'm not sure I understand this one, I've had it happen a few times and I never took offense, never even gave it a second of thought.

Just shows to me that someone is curious/concerned 




 Ya'll mother fuckers need better Facebook friends, I've managed to weed out all of the annoying social media users on my Facebook. It's so much more peaceful being the only person on Facebook. 




 I've since learned how ruthless you have to be on public transport when it comes to inconsiderate people. If you have your legs or bag in the way of the last seat on the train, and I say "excuse me" and you don't move, I get to move your stuff for you/push past you without any recourse.

After witnessing it many times and realising the protocol, I now understand how to deal with selfish people :) 




 He seems to think so. 




 You're **pretty fly** for a short guy.

*cue music* 




 What the fuck is going through people's heads when they say shit like this. 




 Some of my gay friends call straight people 'breeders', I find it fucking hilarious 




 ITT: Validation for my decision to not have any work mates on Facebook and to have my profile completely private to anyone not my friend. 

Also fuck twitter. 




 I saw this last weekend! Insane movie, it holds up so damn well.

I wish Guy Pearce was in more stuff. 




 What else is he going to say? "To be honest, it's the same costume as the other movies"

I'm not sure how much different it can be from the most recent incarnation. 




 There has been lots of hype from critics about how it stands in comparison to the other Marvel movies.

How would you rank it against the others? 




 I forgot @midnight, I watch that for entertainment not for political satire and discussion like the others :)

Real time is tricky to recommend, but if you like the sort of harder hitting conversations from Daily Show and Last Week, then you'll probably like it.

Bill Maher can come off as a bit of an asshole, but I like his bluntness on the subject. Quite often the discussions put everyone out of their comfort zones and it can garner some actual discussion. 

Mind you, sometimes pandering nonsense can also occur. I watch it every week and I enjoy it every week, but I can get why people can't handle Maher. 




 I'm just hoping that Mr Robot isn't his long lost father or something. That would be a completely stupid trope. 




 I'm a programmer too and I can appreciate their efforts.

They also tack on lots of project management buzz words. Gantt charts, scrums, sprints and cycles lol

I love that show so much, I can forgive the artistic licence they used for the compression stuff because they need a piece of revolutionary technology which doesn't already exist. So I have no problem with it.

Since compression technology has real world applications, cracking it in the show is akin to cracking cold fusion and thus makes the impact of Pied Piper more enjoyable to watch. 




 -feels like Fight Club with computers

I would say its a mix between Fight Club and EARLY Dexter.

That feeling of his 'dark passenger' is really enthralling to watch.

Side note: I hate the title of the show, it's so hard for me to get my friends to watch it when I have to defend such a silly title. 




 I stopped watching around 2 months in, I have nothing against Larry, I actually think he's rather funny.

But the show couldn't figure out what it was 2 months in. They kept on switching around the pacing and the format. The round table discussion didn't work, Larry was too soft on people spouting nonsense for a hard hitting TV show and there was too much pandering for a decent comedy.

Daily show, real time and last week tonight are going to have to do for now. 




 Is it just me or does that look nothing like /u/permanentlystoned? 




 I agree, the begining of that 4th day was awesome. Slow and steady play. Some great defence against the good balls and some excellent punishment of the poor ones.

All we needed to do was slow and consistent play. Not have shitty batting collapses. I was so hopeful for the Warner/Smith partnership. 




 Even this video can't make me feel better after this weekend. Damn you England! 




 **We all know how writing on ADWD was hindered by the Meereenese knot, how is writing TWOW going by comparison? Has it been smoother?** 




 Reminds me of [Women are wonderful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%9CWomen_are_wonderful%E2%80%9D_effect).. Kinda. 




 I AM A BANANA 




 This is the main benefit of a treadmill for me, GL trying to watch an episode of arrested development while going for a run outside. 




 Remember this subreddit after BMACs dismissal in the WC final? Even the kiwis were going nuts on him 




  Thatsthejoke.mpeg

needsmorejpeg.gif 




 Has to be Tyrions introduction if done accurately from the books. Remember how he does that tumble thing? That would look completely stupid on TV. 




 Ive never actually given 'recieving compliments' thought since reddit has brought it up, but i honestly cant remeber the last time i got one.

Im so not used to it. For example, i started losing weight over the past 4 months (44 lbs down yay) and ive only just started getting compliments about how i look... and i freeze up lol, my compliment taking muscle has atrophied after all of these years it seems.

I love the compliments and its a real day brightener, but its honestly not something your average dude gets often. Even the ones in relationships. I hope it changes :) 




 I spent quite a long time years ago on /r/atheism and what I learned from my time there, is that I don't think that his quote was satirical. People actually talk like that, it's rather disheartening. 

/r/atheism is a great sub if you're struggling with how society is treating you, it's a bad sub if you're just an angry basement dweller who ironically has a 'holier than thou' attitude towards the rest of the world. 




 The point is to create a massive ongoing joke and holy shit has it succeeded. The chain is hundreds upon hundreds of links long. 

Don't believe me? Go to /r/switcharoo/new and open the newest post and keep clicking the link. 

It's kinda incredible. 




 Oh god, I've done this before. But I was already almost at work when I went "Shit, my keys are not in my pocket. I must've left them at home".

So I proceeded to drive all the way home. I then turned the car off, took the keys out, took 3 steps out of the car and then looked at my hands.

Jesus that was a bad moment. 




 #notallmen 




 I actually don't like my middle name, so I totally omit it.

My paternal side is Austrian, so the name sticks out like a sore thumb. 




 Can we get a rule clarification please? The second he was hit in the groin, is it considered a dead ball? 




 Ire lmao 




 "Dad, what's a muppet?"

"Well. It's *not* quite a mop and its *not* quite a bucket. But maaaaaaaannnn..... *To answer your question, I don't know.*" 




 That's a spoon. 




 I quit back in 2013, but I can for sure speak up about this because I'm an Australian.

In case you didn't know why that's relevant, in Australia we have passed legislation requiring all tobacco products to be plain packaging and have [massive pictures of disgusting smoking related disfigurements on them](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=australian+cigarettes safe=active biw=1222 bih=602 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=iOWeVceHJIbg8AW6pLDACQ ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ gws_rd=cr) (**warning NSFW, gross stuff**). We also have pretty specific rules when it comes [to packaging and marketting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_packets_in_Australia).

I'm not sure what other counties do, but it's kinda intense here down under.

So anyway, how did it feel? I felt nothing and I didn't care. I think I can safely say that there is no smoker alive who has ever seen the warnings and said "Oh shit, it causes cancer? I better not buy this".

We all fucking know how dangerous they are and the majority of us don't fucking care. We're not thinking that far ahead, we're just trying to enjoy a smoke. When you have a drink after a long day at work, do you think to consider the liver damage sustained over a period of time?

So I see the packaging changes as a way to ward off young people from smoking. But I think the social stigmatisation of smoking does more than the packaging ever could. Nearly all of my smoker mates quit smoking and I think it's to do with how our current society reacts towards smokers.

Now if we could only point that stigma towards the junk food industry.... 









 "Disposable Ordnance Remover" heh 




 This is also in australia during the 90s and early 00s. Everything is expensive in aus 




 Try /r/progresspics if you don't already, that place motivates the fuck outta me. It's great to see pictures of people who have the same stats as you :) 




 Some are, sure. But if they're rated as Top Critic by RT then I'm going to trust more that they dont have some sort of bias towards the  film. 




 CICO doesn't work, I read it on the internet. Keep your fake cult away from me and my body builder metabolism. /s 




 It wasn't that long ago where I was in that position, my friends all didn't say anything and I'm glad they didn't. Chances are that the obese person already knows what they have to do, but it's never going to happen unless they want it to.

My friends job during my fatness was to not judge me and not tease me but if I were to spout some fatlogic, they would rip it to shreds and if I said I needed advice, they were all over it.

Several of my friends worked as physical trainers and several were in the army, so any time I did have questions or queries I always had help. But as far as them coming to me? No, never.

Knowing myself, I would probably tell them "I appreciate that you care, but it's my choice to live like this. I know I need to lose weight and I'll do it when I'm good and ready."

 




 "I need to lose weight" - No. They still aren't directly asking for advice.

If they say that, I would probably say "well if you want help with it, Let me know. I've gone through it myself :)"

It's the difference between offering help rather than just giving it. 




 Also daily weight fluctuations can fudge (hehe) the numbers.

I apparently gained 1 kilogram of weight last night. Either I somehow ate 7000 calories over budget, or I'm retaining water and waste. 




 And what reason is that? 




 Also only 6 out of the 24 reviewers are rotten tomatoes Top Critics. They're generally the ones I actually pay attention to.

Also Jeremy and Chris :D 




 Unblinking eye contact for as long as you can, it really is offputting.

Granted, this doesn't work if you love the person dearly. 




 Vegemite.

Seriously, most of the time that I hear people complain about it, it's because they don't eat it correctly. Just because you take a bite out of an onion doesn't mean that onions are not tasty.

 




 Literally anything, that dude has screen presence like no other. 




 Middle children unite : / 




 Oh god, I still have nightmares about this.

Thai fish cakes.

It was one of my mums favourite dishes so she did some research and tried to make it for the family.

Only problem was that she wrote the amount of coriander required wrong, she put in 4 times the amount needed. Now I don't know if you know what too much coriander tastes like, but suffice to say that even our dog, who loves eating shit, wouldn't touch them. 




 Or when you say a joke which gets a laugh, then someone asks you to repeat it for them or explain it for them.

Gah, it never lands as well a second time and you come off as a circle jerker when you repeat it. 




 Any fucking My Face When meme.

It's one of the most unfunny, unoriginal and completely effortless content which can be produced.

Give me a reaction gif and I can make several MFW sentences without any effort.  




 When being asked to talk dirty in the bedroom.


inb4 *yeah you like that, you fucking retard?* 




 Found the vampire. 




 I came here to say this, I do it for clarification all the time. It's an engagement thing.

"So I saw Steve, yesterday-"

"Wait, Steve from work or Steve your cousin?"

"Steve from work"

I find that this is perfectly ok and it helps with clarity and context.

If this is an annoying habit to anyone, they've remained silent for 27 years of my life. I also don't find it frustrating when it happens to me, it shows they're interested and are listening.

I would say interrupting is only a problem when they try to change the subject. 




 You and I have very different friends it seems, if someone in our group doesn't look well we'll ask if they're ok.

No one gets offended, even my female friends. 




 I legitimately do head checks when I walk from the left side to the right for what ever reason.

I do this when I change lanes in a car, why wouldn't I be worried about it when walking on the sidewalk? 




 Your dad is a master of ice breaking 




 This is only an appropriate question if they're already engaged 




 I remember reading somewhere that your body burns around 600 calories to replace the blood lost from donation. So there's that too! :D

Also following up on your main point... Become an organ donor people! I could think of nothing more wonderful than for my organs to help those who need it after I pass 




 I removed all sodas and sugary drinks, began drinking water and green tea

It's funny how making this change seems to do the majority of the work isn't it?

Also removing alcohol is the same thing.

We have near identical stats, I started at 285 and I'm now 241... Over half way to onderland! Ill see you there shortly :) 




 Nice one! I'm in a similar boat too! I just started switching a 45 minute fast walk with intermittent jogging to a full 30 minutes of jogging. Its funny how fitness works isn't it?

Its so gradual that you don't even notice how far you've come. I've found this is most prevalent when I take the stairs. I can now almost run up stairs and reach the top with little or no shortness of breath. 




 My family would do it every week. We would turn up Friday after school, they had a deal with for $20 you could rent 3 weeklys and 2 overnights.

So each week, we would go there and choose 2 new releases and 3 older ones. More often than not, I would not have a different weekly to choose, so I would just get an old favourite - Terminator 2 Judgement Day. You better believe I would rewatch that shit.

I miss it, but at the same time Netflix is just Blockbuster, but 100x more convenient. 




 Solve for X (   ) 




 Holy shit, I might actually see this now. 

Not even kidding, PG versions of this type of movie are so fkn hard to sit through sometimes.

Perhaps having an R rating might make it worth watching. 




 You're not likely to hear a single legit grievance for this casting choice, the dude can act. 




 Have you ever actually been to /r/fatlogic? I'm going with no. 




 You shouldn't need to do anything, if you're as close as you say then he will also want to like your new SO.

Introduce them to each other and don't over think it :) 




 No, that's the guy whose coffee is ready to be collected. Kyle is his name. 




 That it is, Another tip I'll give, let your motivation turn into discipline. 

Chances are that in a little bit, this surge of motivation will die down a little bit. But if you make your efforts part of your life then it becomes a matter of discipline! 

That's what will get keep you going for the rest of your life :) 




 Yes, that's my point. I'm showing that I have a quality which was caused by genetics which is not found attractive to the opposite sex (like fat people who blame genetics) and I don't go around telling women that they're wrong for having that preference. 









  Some people (like me) found the willpower aspect of weight loss easy.

Glad there is someone else like me, I feel really bad when I read about the mental illness struggles some people had to overcome to lose weight. I can't even fathom how hard it must be for them.

Really good post 




 Just make sure if you compare peoples weight loss to your own to factor in height. Even only 2-3 inches of height can make two people with the same weight look completely different. 




 Golf 




 I'm told porn is the tentpole which keeps tumblr erect. 




 Yeah, I was a bit confused too. Context is a bitch sometimes. 




 Hats don't fit on my bald head very well, check your hair privilege. 




  "propter *ham* hoc ergo post *ham* hoc!"

FTFY

 




 I assume you're out east too? It's pretty bad out here. Every weekend I get coffee with mates and we hang out at a shopping center to people watch, its incredible how many are actually in this situation 




 For those who're looking to increase their fitness somewhat, take the damn stairs! It makes such a difference.

According to my FitBit, every work day I ascend and descend around 20-40 floors. All of which could be done with an elevator or escalator. 

As I started to get into shape, I also stopped taking the elevator/escalator and starter taking the stairs for these seemingly short journeys.

This has made a huge difference to my fitness, i've been gradually increasing the speed which I take the stairs and now I'm practically leaping up them. 




 Speaking as a Melbournian who takes the train to the CBD everyday, don't underestimate how obese Victoria is.

Not a day goes by where I don't see 2 train seats taken up by a single person. 




 VICTORIANS REPORT IN


;) 




 when in fact they are both completely in your control.

Even then if it weren't in their control, I still don't understand it. 

I'm a 27 year old man, who is bald. I started going bald at 22 and that's the way the fucking cookie crumbles. This is truly something I didn't do to myself and is totally out of my control.

Now do I get all uppity and in the faces of women who prefer men with hair?

**Fuck no**, I'm not a narcissist, preferences are preferences. So I do the best I can with what I have and move the fuck on.

I don't blame society, that would just be plain fucking silly.  




 Nope, I'm being dead serias. 




 I may have to check them out at home, I don't want to end up on a list at work haha 




 I'm the same, I feel weird wikipedia hopping this subject. But it's so intriguing :( 




 Some form of spell check softwere. 




  ~~gasoline~~ fumes.

~~Petrol~~ Guzzeline

 




 YES! I do the exact same thing. I've been off the butts since September 2013, but I still do the 'keys, wallet, phone, smokes' thigh slaps when I'm out the door. 




 Of course. 




 This is a friends dream, but it's still funny

**TL;DR Friend went to test drive a Lamborghini, accidently murdered the salesman, picked me up to help hide the crime and flee from Nicholas Cage who was investigating the disappearance.** 




 Temporarily make people fart when they yawn, then watch in glee as morning business meetings fall into chaos. 




 I legit came here to write this. It's a party trick i did in my younger days. I have unnaturally strong teeth and I never had any issues after doing this over and over.

One day I did it and thought "This is fucking stupid, you're 24, take fucking care of yourself".

 




 5'7" **is** kinda small in the grand scheme of things. Not small, kinda small. 




 I actually don't think there is a raider around who doesn't understand not likely wow. 

Source: Been raiding in wow since it came out and still don't fully understand why I spend so much time playing every week. 




 Bronnister - works better :D 




 Doesn't matter, got booty. 




 I'm not sure I'd say *grew out of it*, more force myself to break the habit.

Chewing my nails. I have been doing this since I first grew teeth and nails. I was able to break the habit quite a few years ago and my nails are finally healthy and strong. Turns out, when you spend many years chewing your nails they become quite a bit less strong. 




 Adding onto this, turn off every electrical device you can in your room. It may seen weird at first to try to sleep in complete darkness and dead silence, but I've *never* had better sleep than after I started doing that.

My FitBit records all movements at night time and since I've started doing that, I get solid 'rock like' sleep, every night.

Even only getting 4 *uninterrupted* hours sleep is plenty for a day at work. 




 I'm with everyone here, unprovoked physical violence.  




 And so it fucking should. Despite it's name, a pilot has never grabbed hold of me like this one.
