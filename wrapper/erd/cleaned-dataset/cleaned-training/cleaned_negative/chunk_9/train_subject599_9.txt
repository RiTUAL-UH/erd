 That's probably because you're too young to have watched the North Hollywood shootout broadcast over live television. 





























 I don't see a problem with using the tissue for medical research, especially if it can help in the treatment and cure of diseases. 



















 That video is awesome, it's Tim and Eric kind of awesome. 














 I really don't care if Mr. Robot is real or not, I think he is, but that's me. I do get a kick out of all the speculation by viewers though. 




 Definitely got a Sopranos vibe in that scene, especially since [Big Pussy was a talking fish.](https://youtu.be/Qo6cNQwN6LQ?t=1m13s) 














 [Netflix petitioned for it to be considered a comedy.](http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/orange-is-the-new-black-emmys-1201456619/) 




 Not sure why Claire Danes got nominated again, that spot should go to either Emmy Rossum for Shameless or Keri Russell for The Americans.

EDIT: I guess that Shameless is considered a comedy though, since William H. Macy got an outstanding actor in a comedy nomination. 









 I'm rather fascinated by the world of pro-am American football in other countries. I hope you get a chance to get out to the US-Japan championship game.

EDIT: [Here's an article from Ohio.com.](http://www.ohio.com/sports/thomas/international-federation-of-american-football-united-states-blasts-france-82-0-in-semifinal-will-face-japan-in-championship-game-1.608524) 







































































































































































































 It's right at the Judiciary Square Metro station. 




 Born in DC, spending a few days in DC after a cousin's wedding. 




 The "LEO" motif is well done, nicely connects the attributes of lions and the attributes of police officers. 





























 Yeah, I was surprised how old it was. 
























 Was born in DC, a cousin got married in Maryland yesterday   I decided to spend a few days in DC after the wedding. 

















































 RIP 














 First of all they are kittens, so they have a lot of energy, and probably do get a little bored of each other and want to include you - as they age, this won't happen as much.  Second, cats are fairly nocturnal, one vet told me that she closes her bedroom door at night and lets her cats have run of the rest of the house so that she can get undisturbed sleep.

One trick that I've used is that when a cat wakes me, I pull all hands, feet, arms, sometimes even my head under the covers. I have three that are all adults and, for the most, part let me sleep. One loves her treats in the morning so she'll bug me a bit closer to my normal wake up time (she also likes to sleep on top of me, which usually doesn't wake me up these days). 














 Welcome, hope you enjoy it. 














 For New York City, as well as many old US cities like Chicago, a period from sometime in the 1960s through the early 1990s could be referred to as an era of [Crime and Grime.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdDUmvPK2OM) A very significant year for NYC was 1977 - The Bronx is Burning, Son of Sam, the July blackout, etc. In fact, there's a pretty cool documentary called [NY77: The Coolest Year in Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHXAYddPLsM) that I highly recommend. It looks at the problems facing NYC, but also the music scene of punk rock, early rap, and disco.

Anyway, in 1994, Rudy Giuliani took over the mayor's office and installed Bill Bratton as Commissioner of the New York City Police Department, Bratton pushed the "broken windows" concept of policing, which had a heavy focus on punishing quality of life crimes. Trains were cleaned up, a lot of graffiti was cleaned up, more effort to pick up trash, and gentrification was encouraged. Times Square went from a place full of prostitutes, adult movie theaters, and drug dealers to a place with a giant Disney Store.

The NYC depicted in Mr. Robot is not nearly as clean as it is now, the streets are safer in the real NYC, and, Elliot would have trouble affording an apartment on his own, even in Chinatown. That being said, if you've ever watched Gotham on Fox, that really is a NYC stuck firmly in the crime and grime era.

EDIT: TL;DR: Mayor Giuliani really cleaned up NYC to the point that it is much cleaner, safer than as depicted in Mr. Robot. 
























 The problem with juries are that juries are made up of people who view everything through their own personal biases, beliefs, and perceived expertise. There was one car damage case that I had to litigate twice, the two juries were completely and totally different from each other, it was amazing. 

















































 I swear Andy faked his death and then returned as Ted Cruz. 














 I hope this starts happening in more jurisdictions, especially here in Texas. [As it is, the Harris County Jail (Houston) has had to ship inmates to jails in other states due to overcrowding.](http://www.houstonpress.com/news/why-the-harris-county-jail-is-overcrowded-with-legally-innocent-people-7555627) 



















 The fact that he was invited to the dinner party gives me hope that his role will expand as the season progresses.

 Of course he checks his heart rate after sex. 









 He runs a white girl problems Twitter account. 




 Yeah, it's gonna bite him in the ass. 




 This show's version of New York seems to exist in an alternate universe where Rudy Giuliani was never mayor. 




 He probably doesn't realize the guy took control of it, despite news stories a lot of people don't realize a hacker can take control of the camera on the computer. 




 Yep, resolves that theory. 





























 I have to say one of the nice things when I visit Manhattan is that every block seems to have a public trash can on it. 




 There is a CiCi's Pizza in the same shopping strip as the place I go to get my haircut, I swear there is always at least one used diaper laying in the parking lot near the CiCi's. 



























































 I take it that the employee doesn't have comprehensive insurance? If she does, she should file the claim with her company and they'll get the vehicle out asap. 




 When I was in college in the early 90s, one of my roommates brought his old C64, he had a plethora of games for that thing. 




 The 928 has always been one of my favorite Porsche models.

 I think he's figured out that playing to the lowest common denominator and fear mongering gets him votes, at least here in Texas. At the national level he'll get support, but not enough to win the nomination, let alone the general election. 
































































 About 10 years ago I had a hearing in a court in Hidalgo County, the judge had just committed suicide after his office and home were raided by the feds. 












































 Talk about bringing back high school memories. 









 I do love that Darlene is played by the actress who played Dalia on Subergatory. http://youtu.be/_NhA1gHATVE
