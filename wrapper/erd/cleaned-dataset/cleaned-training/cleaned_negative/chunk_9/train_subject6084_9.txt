 And that's why they're called Secret Service agents. 




  Women copied her hair and clothing styles (especially when she lowered the neckline on her inaugural gown by 2.5 inches)

Scandalous! 









 Bird red blood cells do, and these guys found what look like nuclei, so they found something that once contained dinosaur DNA. They were just a few million years too late. 




 A google search for "bird erythrocytes" shows that they do have a nucleus, and that it's only in mammals that they are missing. TIL.

It's better than the write-up: I didn't know the jellyfish "twitch" their tentacles alluringly as well. 














 All these wacky bribes uncovered so far have been in relation to the World Cups in South Africa and Germany. Imagine what went on for QATAR to be awarded the World Cup! 









 [MRW seeing this.](http://i.imgur.com/0hTvUkx.jpg) 




 I'm sure you've all seen it. Something like that might soon come for us Mass Effect fans. Discuss.

 That's a fantastic piece of work! Well done indeed! 





























 That is an EXTREMELY HARD platinum. Hawking would be proud! 




 Russell Crowe, you're drunk. That's an Aussie Burger and we all know it. 



















 If nothing else that is one well-written and entertaining wiki page. Good job OP. 




 That's life trying to, uh, find a way. 




 Surprisingly, there are several other bands from Saudi Arabia on that site. 




 A couple of random examples:

 You can't, the photos we have of the landing sites were [taken from a satellite currently in orbit around the moon.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings#Photographs) 




  The way the police knee him in the back is something they should not do. 

No shit, and yet it seems to be the go-to move whenever we see videos of rough arrests.  




 Wow, I for one did *not* see that coming. 




 I guess this is ironic, in the Alanis Morissette sense of the word. 




 He has an appeal left and will probably be executed on his own later. 




 For the record, the correct breakdown is:

8 executed (1 Indonesian, 2 Australians, 3 Nigerians, 1 Brazilian, 1 Ghanaian)

 This kid is about 77 now. Probably still cuts a rug, too. 



















 It's a different cop, folks. The one you're thinking of is unarmed and locked in Charleston County Jail. 














 Yes, the world returned to a more basic state. 




 We have [dealt successfully with another revolting ideology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial). It *should* be easy to enact similar laws against radical islamist hate speech, but don't hold your breath. 




 Mark Stein was very [prescient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Alone). 














 When the internet and a robot are a better alternative to trying getting a date, your country's gonna have a problem. 









 [Here is the paper being discussed](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004643), in case that link is problematic, as it was for me. 









 Sure, "cuddling". [Just ask these penguins.](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24585481/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/seal-caught-tape-molesting-penguin/#.VLv6Ro_PF2M) 




 Heartbreaking. We have police dash cams, why not body cams? This is a great example of why they're needed, we get to see the humanity of the vast majority of police and the work they do, and make sure that those who abuse their power are held accountable. It's a win-win for everyone. 




 I'm not sure the racist cartoon analogy is appropriate. A religion is not a race. It is a set of ideas, and satirising ideas is fair game, no matter how "offensive" that may be. 




 It seems to be an english language thing in general. Unless I'm mistaken none of the papers in the UK, Australia etc. are reproducing the cartoons. In Canada, ALL of the french media in Quebec are showing the cartoons, but the english media in the rest of Canada (and in Montreal) are not. What that all means I'm not sure. 




 I'm not sure either but I think M. Night Shyamalan has optioned it.

 The guy promoted his snuff film before it was even made. Surprised it took them 8 days. 









 Absolutely fascinating, all of this, but this part doesn't seem to have any backup based on the links provided, and seems anecdotal (thus the highlighting), can someone help?

December 3rd

The second data leak. This one garnered less press but contained was considerably more dangerous... **I've heard** that much of this information was available because an IT director was comprised apparently he had no background in IT and was actually a marketing exec who reached the position (and thus higher salary) through corporate politics. You can see for example is was good at naming files.

(this is not to detract from the link at all, I'm just curious)

 I think it's the "Gangstas in Space" DLC (?). 




 There's a pretty interesting infographic about this [in this article by none other than Bill Gates.](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Most-Lethal-Animal-Mosquito-Week?WT.mc_id=MosquitoWeek2014_SharkWeek_tw WT.tsrc=Twitter) 




 For example, [here](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004741). This doesn't detract from OP's link, however. For a start it uses a completely different technique (EEG vs. fMRI).
