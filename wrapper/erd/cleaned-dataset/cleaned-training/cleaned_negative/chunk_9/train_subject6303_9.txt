 How does bringing a pal in work with birds? 









 As a seller I really hope you check these out and potentially make them available to your customers. I am really excited to get mine in February and see if it lives up to the claims. This is looking like a hands free awesome option:

 This hasn't been shipped yet - first ones come out in February - so I can't endorse it. That said, I have heard bad things about WeVibes and know the difficulties of wands and vibrating cock rings... so this is supposed to be revolutionary. Consider it.

 Love the Catan clock!

 I'm in the SF bay area in CA. I've never taken outdoor succulents indoors in the winter - most of these have been in small pots outdoors for 2 years through winter and summer. Now that I have space I thought it would be fun to give them room to grow! 









 SO CUTE! What luck. That is adorable.

 Adorable bunny! LOVE his little face. 

You are doing a great thing. Links in the sidebar are awesome and curated by smart rabbit-folk. I also recommend Rabbits for Dummies and the House Rabbit Handbook. Glad you found r/rabbits! Lots of good advice and creative solutions from the folks here! 









 ^This. Separate them immediately. Get them fixed. Do not let them live together until they are bonded and definitely get them vet care.

 I love this. Great work, cool medium, and love the inclusion of his mouth and him in the good ol days. A nice portrait of the full character.
