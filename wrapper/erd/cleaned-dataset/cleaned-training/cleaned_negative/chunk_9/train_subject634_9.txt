 He got 2nd place in Evo 2012 too :( 




 Which match was better? Infiltration vs Momochi or Gamerbee vs Infiltration?

Those matches were super hype and close 




 Don't forget the extra twitch views from the Topanga Japan stream. 




 Infiltration got 3rd place again in 2010, 2013, 2015 :( 




 That was only when 1st-4th place already qualified. 




 Momochi and Infiltration guaranteed top 3 + already qualified 




 Can't freaking wait for Ultra Top 8. Also cool that it is on time as well (for the first time ever?) so it could actually finish before midnight over there.  




 Congrats KaneBlueRiver! 




 Who says Marvel Top 8 is dead without the Gods? 160K twitcher viewers NOW!
