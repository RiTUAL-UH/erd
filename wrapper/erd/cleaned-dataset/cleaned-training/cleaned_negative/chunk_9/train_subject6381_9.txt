 Oh I have relevant story for this! He actually did do competitive swimming for almost 10 years and he was quite good. The toe of course was no actual help with his swimming, essentially negligible. 

Well at one of the competitions he was in, one of the other swimmers noticed his freaky little toe and ran to the official and insisted it was cheating and he should be allowed to participate with an "advantage" like that. Official walked over and looked at his one connected toe and laugh, basically told the kid to shut up and that it was in no way an actual advantage haha. 




 Well if I do it, I'll be sure to provide pics of the process. 




 That's exactly what I think of!! I loved commander keep! Still run it on a Dos simulator from time to time :) 




 his mom had the option of separating them at birth, the bones are completely separate it's just the skin that holds them together. But she thought it was "unique" and kept them joined hahaha. 









 I don't care to see more of her, but the picture you posted is very clearly shopped. I don't know how you can't tell... 




 be a use its clearly been edited, this is "realgirls" shopped pictures shouldn't be in here 




 I work at a Tim Hortons and I've had customers complain to me about this several times. I agree that it is completely stupid to advertise their products on the menu board full of THEIR PRODUCTS, but I have had customers even yell at me regarding this. I feel like it's worth mentioning that we in store can't do anything about this. It's all down from corporate.

 Is there a point at whixh you could be hearing so many noises at once that your brain couldn't process all of them? Would you lose sound quality at some point with your brain trying to process several sounds at once? And could you potentially have your hearing damaged this way?
