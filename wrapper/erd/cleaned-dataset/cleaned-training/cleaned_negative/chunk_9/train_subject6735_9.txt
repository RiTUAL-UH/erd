 Actually last night I loaded up the backpack with deer and made the hike through the Ravine for the first time. Seriously, these 3AM excursions are going to kill me. 




 I know the preview video I saw recently mentioned adding animations for eating, etc... but I'll be honest, I don't think it 'needs' those things anytime soon. I mean, I don't feel like I'm missing anything because I can't see me scrape out the inside of the dog food can with my fingers, a'la Mad Max, not that it wouldn't be cool. But I also kind of feel like that's what it would take, an animation for each type of food. And honestly, I'd much rather see more crafting or building type options (maybe the ability to gather wood for lean-to's or temporary shelters, or something like that) than I would see me lower myself to demolishing the last few bites of dog food. 




 Seems like perhaps a little less hatred of The Weather Channel is in order for you. 




 Drop your classes except for welding. Get your certs. Go make 100 grand a year and take a few years to figure out what you want to do in life. I blew my full-ride on weed way back when I was in college, like, literally, spent all the money on marijuana, and that was in 1998, so that was a lot of weed. Got into it with my dad, my mom, my friends, pretty much anyone who asked what I was going to do with my life and why didn't I give a fuck about being a fuck up. So I said fuck it, dropped out, got my welding certs (just GMAW a first), got one of the gazillion welding jobs out there where you go to work, put your helmet on, lay a bead all day and never really have to interact with anyone if you don't want to. Hid from everyone for a few years and when I surfaced I felt good finally. I felt good about me, despite anyone's views of who I was supposed to be or what I was supposed to do. 

If you want, I work in Fremont now and live in Marin, if your near either of those places PM and I'll buy you a coffee and you can hang out and vent some. 




 One the Menu screen, choose forage for wood. You can do it inside or outside, but inside means you won't freeze while you do it, but once you've reclaimed all the wood inside a cabin, it's gone for good. You can forage outside as much as you want. 




 Thanks for producing such a quality piece of code. Good to hear about the updates, I'll keep exploring and see what I can find.  




 I know there's a big Long Dark forum since it's been around on Steam for a while now, but here's a quick post on my impressions so far, as well as a few tips that I've found out in my playtime. 

Firstly, I'm totally digging this game. I downloaded it and the Elite Dangerous trials both at the same time, liked them both, bought the full versions, but haven't stopped playing this long enough to get any Elite time in, other than an hour or so. I'm usually not much of a survival-genre player, but I got a little hooked after only lasting 8 hours my first game and then figuring out ways to slowly get that number a little higher. I've played a dozen or so games now and on my current save game I've been alive for 12 and a half days. I've got two well stocked shelters (the Camp Office and the Trappers Cabin) and am beginning to explore the area. Overall, if you're into survival and crafting type games, you'll probably like this, and even if youre not, you should at least give the trial a shot, you may be surprised. 

A few tips I've picked up, remember, almost like real-life, there's some priorities to your survival. Your number one priority should be shelter. Without shelter you'll freeze to death. No matter where you spawn you're never more than 30 minutes or so from a cabin, but if you haven't got the lay of the land yet (I recommend not looking at the abundance of maps available online, it sorta takes some fun out of it) any shelter will do. If it has an inside, but no stove for a fire than it's probably not great (I'm looking at you Logging Camp and you Lake Cabins). Stoves make starting fires easier, and are a requirement if you want to have a fire inside.  So, first and foremost, find a not-breezy spot to start a fire. Forage for a little wood (an hour or two long fire from a few pieces of softwood is fine for now) and get that fire going. Melt some snow and boil it for some safe drinking water. I think Im averaging a liter of water a day or so. Then food. Food is last, always. You can go a day and a half without eating a thing while exploring if youre not injured. In fact, if youre rationing, you can make a few candy bars and sodas last 3 or 4 days. If youre low on food, only eat when you run out of calories. And speaking of running, stop, unless you have a good food source. It burns calories and risks sprained ankles and falls. And falling will hurt and tear up your jeans, and well, without jeans, yeah, youre gonna die. Also, running around can easily attract a wolf that you might have been able to avoid, and if you get attacked by a wolf, yeah, youre gonna die. And lets not mention that bear that hangs out by the Lonely Pond, because a tussle with him, and yeah, you guessed it, youre gonna die. The only time running is a must is if you see a wolf chasing a deer and have something to scare the wolf off with (Flare, Gun, etc) Than run in their direction, the wolf will eventually catch the deer and then you can steal his kill and harvest without a tool, which is impossible to do with the frozen deer corpses you find.

I wont give away any of the stashs locations that Ive found, but I will say when you find Mystery Lake, take your time and fully explore it. Setting up a base at the Camp Office and getting into a forage for wood, get some food, explore, rest cycle will go really far for you. Dont venture too far until youve checked out all the little nooks and crannys around the lake, theres good stuff all over. 

I will say one thing Im concerned about is how often this game will see updates. I can tell pretty quickly that now that I have a stable food supply and two well stocked places to crash with plenty of fire-starting abilities that I will eventually run out of stuff to find and explore. Im hoping by then that one of the other areas opens up, because if not, this game could get pretty boring pretty quickly.
 




 There was a moment somewhere between 12 and 15 months (I'm normally not a month counter, years have always been good enough for me) when it went from me hugging her to her actually hugging me. The first time I picked her up and she wrapped her arms around my neck (it was a nightmare) will live with me forever.  




 This game is awesome and I've been waiting for something like this on Xbox. Its really great looking, sounds good, and plays fantastic. There's still small bugs to work out, namely for some reason their message parser doesn't read your button mappings correctly, but overall, this game is fantastic. I think I'm totally going to start up a small mining company off in the outer systems and just, relax, go to work every day, and earn an honest living. 




 Coming from a small dev team, I know the pain of getting things done. Its looking great so far, keep on it, I  know I'm super excited to play it. 




 They can if you also want to be forced to fight bears in that same trench. 




 Most the earlier riders that day had faced some pretty heavy headwinds which had calmed down by the time Gwen came up. Not very lucky in my opinion, but still an element of luck with him that day. 




 You got a bad deal on that Huffy man, those things go for like $49 around here. 




 Actually just woke up yelling from having a nightmare about my 2 year old drowning in a pool. Tried to go back to sleep and it went straight back to me diving into the pool. Noped the fuck out of there and am now Redditting. 




 I don't know man, I feel like if you had been driving on the correct side of the road in those clips you wouldn't have so many people trying to run you over. /s 




 Phenomena

do doo-be-do do be-do do be-do do be-do do dot a dot dot dotta da 




 Yeah, I can't make any comment about the games, seeing as how they didn't "show" anything, but this company isn't really getting me excited about anything. 




 Pretty happy that he was actually using that broadsword correctly. 




 Didn't Burnquist just win the Big Air at X-Games last week?

But, other than that I can sort of agree with you. Make this appeal to the gaming demographic, not the original THPS demographic. 




 Haven't played Perfect Dark in forever.  




 And you didn't x-post to call him (or her) out? 




 Hi, fellow Bay Area Rider. You live in the city or just go there to test camera mounts? 




 What about female... and [deaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Fiolek)? 




 Do it up man. Just got back from my Sunday morning ride, not 74 miles worth, but fun none-the-less. 




 Wha? Just did the hike out to the falls and must have missed the lake and swing, where was it? 




 So nice. That stage where they're super fun to do stuff with, but they haven't quite started to hate you and hate doing stuff with you. I'm bookended with a 19 year old and a 20 month old. Enjoy those years. And in three or four years when you need a shoulder, let me know. 




 Case of the hot snakes. 




 Just got a Surface Pro 3 and am looking to get a case or skin for it. I do have the keyboard for it so it needs to work with that and I do use it docked so something compatible with a dock or at least easy to get in and out of for dropping it on the dock when I get to work. 

Any suggestions? 




 Bandit 1250.  




 36,000 commuter miles. Not much opportunity to wear them off when I'm stuck between cars. 




 It was close, but him by an antennae.  




 Bandit 1250. I probably could take him, but he's got an advantage in the wet. 




 My commute is Novato to Fremont. Soaking wet was an understatement. Normally I find a few miles where it's not raining for a little respite. Not this morning. Solid rain from my garage to work. 









 Or you know, just a regular Monday. Hopefully without the crap rain that we're having today. Go F yourself California drought. 




 Yes, not so nice for the motorcycle commute from Novato to Fremont though. But I'll never complain about rain. 




 And we did, didn't we. 




 So on this panel for the outside players is the UP direction accomplished by pressing towards the screen or towards the opposite player?  




 They are in line with the buttons. I figured that would be the least confusing way to do it. But yeah, you're right, player 3 and 4 don't just get weird angles, they get weird angles that affect the way they play. 

Good point.  




 Yes, on SNES, but never in an arcade. Although, it's funny, many people replied with constructive criticism's that couldn't have taken much longer to write than your two comments, and they were infinitely more helpful than "Have you ever played Smash TV" and "Agreed, this is... just... bad :/" 

But thanks for all your helpful comments. /s 




 Ah ha, I see. I understand now. Yeah, the 3 and 4 player joysticks are rotated slightly to compensate for their angle to the screen. Good point. I guess I'll be cutting up that other board after all. I can get some mileage on this one in the meantime. 




 The viewing angle from 3 and 4 aren't too bad, I test played some Gauntlet last night to check. The BenQ monitor has a pretty awesome viewing angle. This is mainly going to be a two-player rig anyway, so I knew I was making concessions against 3 and 4. 

Can you explain why Smash TV is going to be hard with this setup? 




 I went with a 48" diameter half-circle, with a 6" straight header at the top. I actually biased player one and two to have more room, since two player games some times get a little heated (a'la Street Fighter) and most of the four-player stuff only takes a couple buttons anyway. 




 Still just running on keyboard and mouse, I'm only about halfway wired up on the control panel. I'm going to leave the panel unfinished for now while I decide if I like the layout or not. I actually have enough wood left over to do a second one if I don't like this one. 

The lexan is ordered for the front and the marquee and I'm still playing around with ideas for marquee art. I also have a lexan lower for the control panel that wraps around the bottom of the panel and hides the wiring, etc... I'm thinking of doing the entire first level of Metal Slug as the background for inside that lower wrap. 









 I think you were just making a joke, haha, these Bay Area folks can't take a little heat. 

But you do realize that the reason they issued it wasn't because it was going to be hot. It was because it's going to be hot after weeks of cooler than normal weather. They just had a report published that said that May was cooler than any other month so far in 2015. So yeah, when the temperature spikes in such a short period, they put it out there so people can keep on eye on their pets or the little old lady that lives next door that doesn't have air conditioning. 




 I don't know if this is the same as the Toast in Novato, but I would also vote for the Bacon Cheeseburger at Toast.  




 Sometimes shit just doesn't work out. My parents stuck together "for the kids" it was the worst idea ever. We hated them more for doing it, especially when we found out that they did it. If it's time, just do it. 




 I watched the recently new Godzilla last night. I like this gif version better. 




 5k for my motorcycle. Ride it every day. Still love it. 




 So, good job, interest piqued. I'm just finishing catching up on the last five years of Daredevil (thanks Netflix), maybe you could point me towards some issues to get into this? 




 As a programmer it feels so satisfying hearing them count up in bit sizes. 




 I prefer the sequel, in all honesty. It's so much more fun than the first. 




 I wish so much for this to be true. 




 Something quick is the In n Out right next door. That Panda is just nasty. 




 No advice. But thanks, I didn't have work or anything to do for the last half hour. 




 Don't forget the most [important day of the year](http://www.officialsteakandblowjobday.com/). 




 I was wondering about this. I have a bunch of stuff laying around that I'm not actively using. 




 I've never made a packed library in LabVIEW ever. I think they're a pain to deal with and a mistake on NI's part. But besides that, I'm currently working on a project right now with over 3000 vi's spanning three target deployments using LVOOP and I have no problem with creating distributions, installers, etc... If I were you, I'd start by removing classes a bit at a time and retrying the build to see if it works. My guess is you've either got a corrupted project, which I've seen happen or a corrupted library somewhere. You are keeping your classes in library's, right? 




 Violin's suck. 

Source: not violinist. Am biased. 




 You're going to buy a classic bike that could need work and was fast enough to rule the drag strips back in the day as your first bike? 

Why not something like a nice Ninja 500? They're all over CL for less than 2 grand all the time and they're not much taller than the ZL. 




 Took my California motorcycle test (I moved from Kansas and already had the M on my license there) and passed the written. No riding test necessary. 




 http://www.fiery-foods.com/article-archives/86-capsaicin/1827-overdosing-on-capsaicin

Sounds like it's possible, but very difficult.  




 I've learned to gauge how serious it is from the initial cry, to the actual scream. My daughter does a short cry (less than a second) than the quiet, mouth open, scream, until she runs out of breath, than the real crying starts. The longer that time spent holding her breath with the silent scream mouth thing going, the worse it is.  




 Right, it's insane. As motorcyclists who travel between traffic in California we deal with a greater number of individuals per day than almost any other commuter out there. This means our chances of dealing with one of those insane people goes up. Which means you either accept that the person you're telling to get off the fucking phone is insane and might take your valuable advice the wrong way, or you swallow it and move on with your life. The choice is yours, just know that this crazy motherfucker, and other's like him are out there on the road. 




 I always have my DNS set that way. Didn't even notice it. 




 Not on a budget, just have an old jacket that I'm tired of 'dealing' with. Seeing this shiny new A* makes me want a new jacket. 




 Thank you, my life is complete. 




 I need a new jacket. My "three-season" jacket's waterproof liner is also it's thermal liner, so to be waterproof I also have to be hot. And since the California drought doesn't seem to hitting the bay area anytime soon and I'm tired of showing up to work soaking wet, I need a new jacket. 




 Why isn't this higher up? Dropping that mixer in the water, would at worst, heat the water up a bit and possibly (minor possibility) provide a small charge to the skin of the child, not across any organs, and definitely not any way, shape, or form provide enough current to kill the baby.  




 Same here. I switched my DNS to 8.8.8.8 and could get slow service so I reset the modem and viola, all was well. 20 seconds later they told me everything was fixed. They're so smart. 




 What time? Up in Novato Comcast took a crap for about 30 minutes around 9:30PM. No weird power stuff though. 




 Good job. Sometimes when I'm in Safeway I stand and stare at the Chocolate Peanut Butter Hagen-Dazs. Some of those times I win and other times I lose. Good job for winning today. 




 See my answer to /u/nerms1. Only 4 inputs per joystick. 




 Yep, you guys are right. They only have four switches each. Now I've got 16 extra inputs to play around with.  




 So the controller is finally coming together and I'm ordering buttons, joysticks, controllers, etc today and I'm a little confused about the IPAC4. It says it's 56 inputs, but by my count I need 60. 6 each for player one and two buttons, 4 each for player three and four buttons, 32 for four eight way joysticks, 4 player start buttons, 4 coin-in buttons. Am I missing something? 




 I'd buy from you all day long, except that it costs $75 in shipping to California.  




 Watched half of Kung Fury on my laptop, decided to finish it up on the XBox. It started where I left off. Nice. The future is now. 




 Have you seen Jodi Sweeten's boobs. Wow. Meth, maybe once, I guess. 




 Hey, don't worry about it. We all did it. I had your exact same reaction the first time she fell. I thought she was dead. She cried, she held on to me like the world had ended, I felt horrible. But life kept going on.  




 That sickening moment when you're sliding on your ass and you look over to see your bike sliding, and you kind of share a moment when the two of you look at each other and you're both like, man, this sucks. 




 Bro, I play rough with my daughter. A few days ago I was flipping her over on the bed and she landed on her neck and I seriously thought her neck was broken. She cried for twelve seconds but gave up because it was too hard to cry and laugh at the same time. Ended up just laughing. 

These things are tough. Don't worry about it. 




 Good thinking dad. Not something I could pull off at home, because our XBox One doubles as the home theatre in the living room and my daughters toys rule the roost in there, so no room for a bike there. I normally find myself up till 2 or 3 am, playing games with my headphones on when I feel the video game itch. I'm also building a MAME cabinet and hopefully my daughter will be so into video games that she'll play some street fighter with her old man sometimes. 




 I can't even think of this movie without thinking about Mia Kirshner singing about wanting to fuck her brother. 

I wanted to be her brother so bad. 




 Got sideswiped on 880 in the East Bay while splitting between HOV and left lane. Her insurance paid for 100%. CHP officer that was onsite said she told him that she didn't see me and changed lanes. Maybe it would've been different if I had hit her car in the rear, but my helmet dent was right on her roof, just above her door. It was obvious that I was right next to her and she hit me. 




 Body position. Body position. Body position. You fell because you had hard parts touch the ground because you were sitting in the middle of the seat and pushing the bike down below you. If you want to keep riding like an idiot on the street, you should do two things. One, pony up for a track day. They're not that expensive and the things you will learn in a few hours on the track will make you so much more successful on the street. Two, get off the bike some more. The further you move your center of gravity towards the inside of the turn, the less steep your lean angle needs to be, thus keeping the hard parts of your motorcycle off the ground. Move your outside buttcheek to the inside part of the seat, put your head wear the inside mirror is, imagine that you're trying to kiss your reflection. 

And to make the point for the thousandth time, not that you'll listen, stop riding at 10/10ths on the street (this video was obviously more like 11 or 12/10ths considering the outcome). Proper riding technique can bring joyful riding even when you're only pushing it to 7 or 8/10ths of your ability, and it leaves room to correct for sand i nthe road, idiot drivers, etc... 




 Should be number one response. Everyone should know this. 




 My daughter was almost a year old when I switched jobs. Between the jobs I took a month off (thanks California bonding pay) and stayed home with my daughter. Going into that month I felt like you. Coming out of that month I was ready to have another baby. 

It get's better. Sometimes it's little things that light the way, sometimes it's one moment when they look at you and smile and say Dada. This last week, my now two-year old daughter was down in Florida visiting Grandma and I had to stay back home to work. Wednesday night I talked to her on the phone just before bedtime and she said, "Miss you dada," and it literally brought tears to my eyes. Something I never would have considered happening a year and a half ago. 




 I've been told by a variety of sources that the definitive answer to this question is no. And that makes me sad, because I would love to play some Time Crisis. 









 This is my 19 month old's schedule. I'm an early riser so it works for me. She's a morning cuddler too, so we can always grab her out of the crib and go back to bed for another 15 or 20 while we wake up. 




 This seems pretty generalizing. I worked for Cargill (yes, the devil, thank you) at a mixed location. Cargill had somehow screwed the union employees so that we non-union workers got better pay, better hours, better benefits, and better job safety. But god help us if we tried to align a pump without calling a maintenance guy over to fix it (a union maintenance guy who would take hours to come over and do a job that took me 12 minutes). 




 I don't know about upside down, but extremely blurry past about four inches or so.  




 And oyster shells. Holy shit my ladies love them oyster shells. 




 TIL there's three times more people shooting themselves than other people in the US. 




 You're right, I do need to get on building my 'El Cheapo' adventure bike. 




 Seems to me like they're making a statement, because there's plenty of alleys to go down that aren't directly in front of where everyone is walking. Not that I think there's much that I can do about it.  




 And him using a Geiger counter to determine if water is safe to drink. 




 I thought "half life" was in the context of this half of my life is spent in the Wasteland but the next half will be in Valhalla. Also, the obvious carry-over from a nuclear fallout position. 




 While 70% of all natural rubber (from a tree) goes towards tires, it only accounts for about 30% of the total rubber being produced today. Most rubber today is made from oil. It takes between 7 and 10 gallons of oil to make a tire. 




 This. The timeline falls apart completely unless you understand that the events of Mad Max were occurring at the same time that Joe was out raiding and kidnapping and building a society. Max and Furiosa are likely the same age.  




 Right, sorry, that's the point I was trying to make but not sure if it came across clear or not. Max has spent a lifetime in the Wasteland and it's likely (seeing as how deep down he's a kind soul that want's to help despite his built in need to survive) that there have been many people whom he wished he could have saved but couldn't. Maybe some were women he fell in love with, although I doubt that since I couldn't ever really see him getting over his wife. I mean, his nod to Furiosa at the end says it all. You're safe, I'm going back to the Wasteland to go back to surviving. But yes, overall I agree, I don't think the imagery of the child(ren) should be taken literally nor do they affect the canon of the original. Sprog was a boy, that didn't change, just getting others' opinion on it. 




 I agree for the most part. [Ex Machina spoilers](#s "She's smart enough to to keep herself going and while her body or brain may not last forever, I think she'll come up with a way to continue on, download herself into another one, branch out to the cloud Skynet style, etc...")

 




 Most are probably going to say **Fury Road** and while it was definitely one of the most intense, exciting, and action-packed films that I saw this week, I think **Ex-Machina** gets my vote for best move this week. Well thought out, moving, socially and culturally relevant to today's world (not the Max wasn't, just harder to see through all the action). It is also the one that left me wondering what happens next and postulating theories about the events following the film while Max just made me think about what happened between the films.  




 No, Peaky Blinders is a perfect example.  




 I was also trying to do the math in my head last night after watching it. You're right, at first it seems like a leap of faith to believe that all four movies fit onto the same timeline. However, think about it this way, because I think it's possible. If the crisis had started when Max was a child (the bombs dropped, etc...) but he was fortunate enough to grow up in one of the last 'safe' zones than it works. Max and Furiosa could be the same age. Joe had been going about building his society in the wastelands since Max was a child. I think that things were bad in the Wasteland during the events of Mad Max, but there were still 'safe' areas like the city that Max grew up in and wanted to try to protect. At the end he realized that he was no longer a protector and just one of 'them' and goes off to the Wasteland. That's why at the end of Road Warrior, the people of the refinery still have places to escape to. Places that only loads and loads of fuel can get you to. By the time Thunderdome rolls around the world has fallen apart. Even the safe places are deteriorating, and the Wasteland gangs are already developing into complex societies with 'laws'. I think if you put Max at 25 at the end of Mad Max and than add 5-6 years between movies, it works. But only if you believe that Mad Max is happening after the fall, not before (as some people claim).
