 Ashley as a name can go either way. Ash from the Evil Dead is an Ashley. 




 The urban legend of a body being in a hotel mattress was true, and happened here in my home state. Let me see if my wonky connection will let me dig up a link.

 YES. YES. I FUCKING. All my friends think it's hilarious too like I'm some sort of mutant. Recently, I went to go  visit my girlfriend and she gave her nephews balloons to play with /KNOWING/ they freak me out so I had to sit there in front of her family with my fingers constantly in my ears and yes, the little shits did pop them. 




 YES, THIS! Oh my god, I had no clue other people felt this way. We have these knives with wooden handles and I wont wash them and my roommate mocks me. I cant stand the feeling. its like even after I stop touching it I can feel it in my hand.
