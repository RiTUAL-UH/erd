 Have you seen Bloodline? That first season is 13 episodes...about 10 of those is just padding. 




 Actually, he's just been standing outside of Emma Stone's apartment since the Dumb and Dumber To premiere. 




 Which unequivocably  means working  under Friedberg and Seltzer. 




 Add onto that overprivileged selfish white guys who wanna get out of the projects...oh wait they're not in the projects WTF. 




But seriously, the only way I'd see this movie is if it turns out to be a straight-faced parody of itself.   




 I came here to say this. I would love for there to be a scene where he grabs himself and is shouting for his old face to be returned to him. "Give ^it ^^back!" 




 What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this thread is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.  




 Don't let facts hide the truth. 




 Whoa, hey now...It's definitely a different take and I can respect any actor willing to take on a role that would undoubtedly be compared to such a memerable character...That being said, the Mads Mikkelsen lends a more reserved take on the character, which has paid off so far and is a service to the character. Whether the writing holds up in the future, one can only hope.  




 No he died.

 THE STAR WARS TEASER BEFORE THE AVENGERS LOOKED BEAUTIFUL!!! 




 Watching Dear Zachary would be worth it to watch again by way of introducing someone new to the movie just to savor the moment of devastation on that persons' face...were it not for the fact that my soul disintegrates after every viewing. 




 Mine are as follows:

1) Sofia Coppola-Lost in Translation


2) Kathryn Bigelow-The Hurt Locker


3) Mary Harron-American Psycho 




 THEY COMFORT HIM!

 It's a decent show with a higher production value and attention to detail than most. I've only missed the final season, which I've heard mixed things about.  




 He shows up in 3-4th seasons as a mid level gangster allied to Nucky. He has a fairly interesting arc if you pay attention. 









 It's a miracle!

 Wow, this prank got me. I was fooled. It was a victimless joke and both videos were funny with and without the context. That's how you write a joke. Can't wait until Denis does the late show rounds and talks about this and other ACTUAL nightmare shoots.

 I miss ACOCO. "LIVE from the Spill studios located behind the liquor store off the I-35 Interchange, it's time once again for a couple of cold ones with Korey and Carlyle." *sigh* 




 Yes. 




 I agree but that series got overdone and whenever they would introduce a new element it wouldn't work.  




 That's not an actor though.  




 Still I would like to see him pass the bond buck. 




 Mel Gibson. I know people hate him for he prejudiced remarks but the dude can act...even if he is aging rapidly, What's up with that.  




 Awesome,  I had planned to watch this yesterday but couldn't find it. 




 Are there any talented actors that have stagnated or disappeared that deserve a comeback?  




 The babadook? To US Netflix?  




 Saw this last night. I loved how the entity in the house opened the door behind her slowly. Instead of freaking out she unscrews the door. 




 The Shawshank Redemption. 




 Yep, although parts feel a bit exploitative. 




 Put the bunny...back in the box. 




 Also, why? 




 Look, the whole "pay to win" system is in place to target either casual players or gamers who simply don't have the time to play as much because they're working or they're parents. You can stand on the shore shaking your fist at the ocean all you want but that tide's coming in. I agree that some games are really bad with this method but eventually the market will decide. I personally don't play these games but I don't fault those who do. spend your money how you like.

 "The gang gets reviewed." 




 My lens. The one pictured above, is it me or the lens?


I can only get things into focus if they are extremely close, is it my fault? 




 So is my lens not for what  I'm looking for? 




 Why do I keep screwing up? 

1st- the camera I order is all Japanese. 
2nd-the lens I get is 4/3 not "micro" 4/3
3rd- the sd card I get isn't formatted for video recording.
4th- i don't understand how to use the lens.

 I have a 35mm f1.6 and a 14-45mm f3.5-5.6. I'm having trouble getting alot in focus with the latter it's usually only really close things like my guinea pig.  try to keep in mind that I'm just starting out so its most likely my fault that I'm doing something wrong. My preference would be to shoot in wide angles with a "deep depth if field." 




 That movie wasn't quite my tempo. 




 He might fit in his vision if they shot with a wide enough lens. 




 If it's a dream why does it ask beforehand if you wanna wake up?  




 Each of his videos is worth watching.

 This picture drew up some controversy when it was released. 




 He has a "Dreams Shattered" look when Abed clarifies that. 




 in my opinion you should record all of the auditions and have the actresses act out the crucial point in the movie and then pick up scene and have them improv that part but don't let them come in with something that they could have had prepared beforehand.

 Gotta add meatballs and some sort of multivitamin and I'm good. 




 I watched this before eating today. Even with the bathroom scene as contrast, spaghetti has never looked sexier. 




 I've seen examples of shots taken using a particular lens and the image bends or blurs near the edges. 


Also how can you tell if a lens has a short/long throw? 




 Each of his videos are worth watching. 




 I don't know. When buying lenses online I wouldn't be able to distinguish good lenses from bad ones. I don't know what to look for.


Also are there any lenses that are good in action shots but bad in still shots or vise versa?



What is a short throw(as opposed to?)? 




 Be creative with what you have, make the shots narrower and you can redress and reuse extras.

Film riot had a thing about this. 




 How do you know if a lens is bad for filmmaking? 




 Each of his videos are worth watching.
