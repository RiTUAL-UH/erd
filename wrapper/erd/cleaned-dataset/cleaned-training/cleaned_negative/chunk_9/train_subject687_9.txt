 It's from some horrible place. 




 I agree.

 Add to reduce reduce to deduce 




 Hail the jewel at the center of the lotus 




 LOL 




 Well, ok.... 




 Well, maybe. But not when mods have their permission reduced, eh? 




 I'm only trying to avoid the problems of the sub bouncing all over or mods having their permission taken away for no reason. 




 I mean there's nothing wrong with being weird and changing the CSS, as long as it is possible to post, unlike /r/ooerintensifes. Also taking away mods' permissions without a reason should be against the rules. Anymore suggestions? 




 Terrible memories :( 




 Thanks :) 




 I agree with you

 Oh... but some guy makes it so wild, that the subreddit is like bouncing all over the place D:

 I will rid the world of the SAT

/r/nomoresat 




 I wish I were smart enough to create an app. 




 Yeah...  




 /r/Moderatoria used to be like that, but then some bad mods started breaking the sub... that's why our permissions were reduced. 




 Nope... they don't have full permissions except 2 of them... but they haven't been here in a while.... 




 Well, /r/Moderatorium is not completely broken... mods can still be added there.... 









 Oh buddy ;-; if only I had full permissions as a mod... I could fix things! 




 Someone is messing with the subs :( 




 /r/moderatorium 




 Come on.... lets just take care of it and leave it the way it is. 




 I used this wonderful website:

 Yeah... I like the less intensive one... I wonder how people are able to post in the one that moves... 




 Nope... 3 missing characters at the end.... 




 Nope... it's just the CSS... 




 That's not a secret sub though... it's a mess because we made the mistake of adding too many mods. 




 Search up bro ;) But i'll give you a big hint for another.... it's called "nameaser___" 




 It'll probably happen around evening... or in some parts of the world on July 1.
