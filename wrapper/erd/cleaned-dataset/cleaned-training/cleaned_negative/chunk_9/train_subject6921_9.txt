 Thanks for giving my research some direction. My grandmother's grandfather would certainly have been born in the 1800's, but after seeing the pistol I figured it was WW1 Era or later. Cool piece of family history but I doubt it's worth much. 




 Grandmother says this revolver was owned by her grandfather. It's a US Revolver Co. .38 S W 5-shot top break revolver with pearl-looking grips. It's not in immaculate condition but I'd love some more information if any revolver guys could help me out. I have the serial number as well but I'd rather not post that so publicly.  









 I mean, as far as I can figure, you'll spend $200-300 in a decent barrel. Gunsmithing work is up for debate but from the prices I've seen around, installation and truing would put you in the $600-700 range total. And wouldn't you rather add to the collection anyway??? 




 Well in that case it might be a good idea to call an experienced riflesmith and see what they have to say on the subject. Good luck though, we'd love to see the progress 




 Not much personal experience with such major gunsmithing, but I'll offer this: if the accuracy of the T3 from the factory is even remotely satisfactory, just sell your rifle and buy another one in your chosen caliber. There's a lot of work and money that would go into changing calibers. Certainly more money than purchasing a T3, especially if you'd add the funds gained from selling your current rig. Do with that what you wish, just my $0.02
