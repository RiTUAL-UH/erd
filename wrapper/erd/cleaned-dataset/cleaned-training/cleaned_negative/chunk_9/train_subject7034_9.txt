 Umm, [sure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_007#Shootdown): "A United States Air Force Boeing RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft flying in the area was monitoring the missile test off the peninsula." 




 While I don't know what was going through the pilot's mind or what his orders were when he fired...

 They knew it was a civilian aircraft, they wanted to wave their dicks and shot it down.

...I'm pretty sure that the USSR could have found some more effective and less lethal way to wave their dicks around. After all, downing civilian airliners is not a good way to generate positive PR.

 Also gonna need some citation on an RC-135 being in the area, because I'm fairly sure you just made that up

When our propaganda organs started their narrative about the downing of the KAL airliner this facet of the shoot down was at times denied, and at other times ignored or buried. Now long after the USSR voted to break itself up, it is admitted and talked about.

A source?! For one, try actually reading the Wikipedia link/article that you originally posted. 




 So much for Russia being isolated... 




 Personally, I believe the unbiased scientists funded by Monsanto and our other corporate overlords. They would not lie no matter how much it financially benefits them -- just like CNN or the NYT would never lie. 




 Make sure you omit the fact that a US RC-135 intelligence aircraft was also in the area and the Korean airliner strayed over some of the most sensitive military areas of eastern Siberia.

If you include facts like those some may wonder if it was some sort of ruse to trigger Soviet air defenses and have the US spy plane record all of the electronic data.

After all, [we would never deliberately violate Soviet airspace to spy on them with aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_U-2_incident) and then *lie* about it, right?

 "The chief problem in historical honesty is not outright lying. It is omission or de-emphasis of important data. The definition of 'important', of course, depends on one's values." -- Historian Howard Zinn 




 But hey, after slaughtering those hundreds of innocent civilians on a scheduled airline flight, and shelling Iranian oil facilities in the Persian Gulf, the Iranians understood that the US government was serious about forcing them to agree to a ceasefire with our old ally Saddam Hussein.

Of course, the Iranians would later down a 747 over Lockerbie Scotland, but we fooled them and framed Libya for that tragedy. 




 Since when is corporate greed, inefficiency and price gouging considered "politics" by this sub-reddit's censors? 




 If that's all it was used for, that might be fine.

But the reality is that the US uses solitary confinement as torture. For example, to persecute former Black Panther [Albert Woodfox](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Albert+Woodfox+solitary+confinement), he was held in solitary confinement for *more* *than* *40* *years.*

Early in our republic the US was famous for *lenient* sentences for criminals. Quakers invented the penitentiary, a comfortable room with a bed and desk, at a time when Europeans were still literally throwing people into dungeons.

Fast forward to today and the US is not only the world's leading prison nation, but we're famous for prison rape and torture and for our draconian punishments. Clearly [we're doing something dramatically wrong](http://www.democracynow.org/2015/7/15/strange_bedfellows_why_are_the_koch). 




 Like Israel, there's no way the Saudis would ever attack Iran without a US green light of approval (even though our lying government may publicly deny they gave a green light). 




 Nice, but one has to wonder if our government, the prison capital of the world which makes heavy use of solitary confinement and which unapologetically tortures people, will comply. 




 We have money for wars and global skulduggery, but our [infrastructure](http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/grades/) is literally falling apart.

**Edit:** USA Today [is reporting](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/20/collapsed--10-bridge-given-rating-just-last-year/30428515/) that the 48-year old bridge was given a rating of "A" by the federal government just last year. But seemingly contradictorily the bridge was said to be "functionally obsolete".

Bureaucratic snafu? Bureaucratic cover-up? Incompetence? Act of god?

Who knows? All I know is that in-use bridges aren't supposed to collapse. 









  How are these not two sides of the same coin? 

Because we have proven solutions to deal with global warming right now. To assume some scientific solution means doing nothing today and then applying some risky geo-engineering gamble when things are really bad.

 It's not the *people*, it's the *governments*.

I'd go a bit further than that, would echo Naomi Klein's analysis; it's not only the governments, it's capitalism. It's the entire economic system based on greed and short-term profits that doesn't give a damn about the environment, sustainability, sanity or actual people. 




 Trump should be *proud* he did not fight in the Vietnam War -- there's honor and no sin in that!

McCain, on the other hand, was US Navy royalty and participated in the US' immoral war of aggression on Vietnam.

Let's remember, the US government broke an international agreement to hold elections to reunite North and South Vietnam because the CIA reported that the communist leader Ho Chi Minh would win any free and fair election.

The US government lied to the American people and the world about the [Gulf of Tonkin incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident) to start the war, backed a Catholic dictator in Bhuddist South Vietnam and then waged a war which resulted in about 3 *million* Vietnamese being killed. McCain dropped bombs on Vietnam, a country that never attacked us. McCain was shot down, tortured, beaten, etc., but blunt truth is that McCain and the US were the war criminals of that immoral war.

The bottom line is that today this entire "controversy" about the [demagogue](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demagogue) Trump disrespecting the war criminal McCain is political theater.

This is nothing more than a temporary [wedge issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_issue) designed to prevent people from talking about global warming, the US' many wars, our floundering economy, or any of the far more important issues that we should be talking about. 




 Exactly, thus my point is that the term "un-American" may seem handy and/or patriotic, but it's essentially a worthless label.

 How else can you keep people tolerating ever-increasing police budgets and the epidemic of police brutality and murders unless you create a fear of crime in them?

It's the same role the TV show "24" (and others) played, and the same reason the US government manufactures many "terrorist" cases by entrapping some ranty clown and charging him with plotting to blow something up.

 "In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares." -- [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3755686.stm) documentary "[The Power of Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Power+of+Nightmares)"  




 But that's their job! Their job is to present a rational, coherent, plausible US government, pro-Pentagon, pro-capitalist and pro-corporate America, neo-liberal spin on news and events.

Their propaganda and bias is not ranty or overt and is very subtle. But it's propaganda nonetheless. 




  NPR is Fox News with a liberal veneer, but a veneer that's only convincing if...

I disagree.

FOX News is overt, ranty, right-wing propaganda which supports capitalism, corporate America and the US government.

NPR/PBS is subtle, non-ranty, neo-liberal propaganda which supports capitalism, corporate America and the US government. 




 Is China unapologetically torturing people and invading countries left and right, slaughtering hundreds and hundreds of thousands of civilians? Does China claim a "right" to attack any country it wants to attack even if it wasn't attacked first?

No, the worst thing one can accuse China of doing is building/expanding islands in the South China Sea and making loans to many countries to develop their infrastructure.

This is yet another article promoting the US' new (renewed) Cold War. Its purpose is to teach people to think in binary military terms, and demonize China and to paint them as a US "enemy."

 Considering that both Nixon and Reagan worked with foreign powers to undermine a sitting US president to win their respective elections, "un-American" doesn't really mean much, does it? 




 Let's suppose they're successful at killing the deal.

What will the GOP, the Israeli lobby, and the entire US government look like if this much-heralded deal, a deal worked out over many months of hard-nosed negotiating, is shot down.

At that point, Iran will say, "We're complying with the deal" and they'll look like honest angels.

The US and Israel will both look like war-loving lunatic liars. (Not far from the truth, but the point is they'll look bad.) 









 If you're a shareholder of any one of the military-industrial/surveillance complex corporations, the answer is undoubtedly YES!

If you're an average American, no way. 




 Your summary of Obama's background is very, very plausible -- no doubt about that.

 obama's not a 'coward'

I was merely contrasting Obama's public feel-good rhetoric to his actions. Given his many sell-outs, one can only come to the conclusion that either he is completely controlled and thus a political coward, or that he is a very good liar and deliberately misrepresents himself. Or both. 




 Sure, [Wikiquote says this is from](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler) a 1935 socialist newspaper "Common Sense."

Butler is a fascinating but almost forgotten hero from American history.

Most Americans recall Congress' "House Un-American Activities Committe" as being the platform for Joe McCarthy's anti-communist witch-hunt during the 50s, or the 1960s when Vietnam anti-war protesters called in front of the HUAC mocked the entire proceeding and made a laughingstock out of the HUAC.

But the HUAC was founded in the 1930s to investigate the fascist coup d'etat which Butler blew the whistle on.

Being a popular and highly decorated general, Butler was approached by a group of industrialists who wanted to overthrow the US government, create a fascist government and to put him in charge as their figurehead (the so-called "Business Plot"). But Butler informed the Roosevelt administration about the traitors and caused FDR allies in Congress to start the HUAC.

Butler's famous short book "War is a Racket" should be required reading, but few have ever heard of it.

Today, the US Marine Corps issues out a suggested reading list of famous Marines to indoctrinate young Marines in training about the heritage and valor of the USMC. Despite Butler being 1 of the 2 most highest decorated Marines, needless to say Butler is not on the Corps' suggested reading list. 




 Partisan is an understatement. I started using /r/uspolitics because of the blatant censorship and [Yellow Dog Democratic mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_dog_Democrat) of /r/politics. Sadly, /r/uspolitics seems to be just as partisan, but thankfully without the censorship.

I think your post makes the sin of criticizing a Democrat. That's pretty likely to be downvoted here, no matter how much a war monger he is and no matter how repulsive the ideas are. 




   the US most definitely did decrease spending after the Cold War.

Despite the graphic from a rightist source, as I said previously, I agree that for a few years Clinton did allow inflation to eat away at the "defense" budget. 

I see the core of what you're saying is that after decades and decades of wasteful military spending, and a shrinking percentage of world GDP, the US was forced to shrink cut is carrier fleets and dream of fighting two major wars down to reflect economic reality.

I don't disagree. Many history books have been written about how excessive militarism has wrecked the economies of empires and have lead to their decline. We're not an exception to that rule.

We saw it most clearly during our war on Vietnam. LBJ's years of deficit spending had many impacts. Social Security spending and its tax was merged into the "combined federal budget" to try to hide the costs of the war.

Nixon's expansion of the war into Cambodia and his deficit spending finally lead to countries openly questioning the solvency of the US dollar. France even went so far as to send a warship to the US to collect France's gold (a warship that returned empty). Nixon was forced to detach the US dollar from the gold standard, thus saddling succeeding presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter with the ensuing inflation caused by Nixon's move to inflate away the massive costs/debt of the war.

Bush's strategy of launching multiple wars and *cutting* taxes at the same time was sheer economic insanity.

With such a love of war, it's only common sense that we would eventually start paying an economic price and to be cutting back on the size of the US military.

 Hence, even with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wound down/done,

Done? Don't you mean *lost?* The US Army's War College long ago rendered their verdict that *both* of those wars were strategic defeats for the US. Spending *trillions* on such adventures with no economic benefit to the US simply quickens our decline.

 there is shift back to high tech equipment.

Shift or not, it hasn't meant that US wars around the world are any more successful, though the shareholders of the military-industrial complex probably have a different definition of "success."

 "In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist." -- President (and former General) Dwight Eisenhower, Jan 17, 1961. 




 I don't know what your point is. Clinton did not *cut* the so-called "defense" budget. He only allowed inflation to eat away at it.

Let's remember, the gigantic US military was sold to us for decades after WWII because of the "threat" of the USSR and communism.

But there was certainly no dramatic spending cuts despite the fact that the Politburo of the Communist Party of the USSR voted to break the USSR up into over a dozen countries that then became capitalist; the Warsaw Pact, which was created in response to NATO, was abolished; and Russia allowed the reunification of Germany, and then peacefully and voluntarily withdrew hundreds of thousands of troops from eastern Europe. In short, our enemy evaporated and became capitalist -- but NATO still exists and US military spending was barely impacted.

Yes, military spending increased after the 9/11 attacks and the month-plus-long series of anthrax attacks of 2001.

Considering Kennan's quote above, was the reason for that increased military spending because we had succeeded in *inventing* (Kennan's word) a new enemy?

What seems crystal clear is that the real reason for the massive US military spending after WWII was *not* because of the USSR and the "threat" of communism.

 "In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares." -- [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3755686.stm) documentary "[The Power of Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Power+of+Nightmares)"  




 It's interesting to see how the so-called "end" of the Cold War meant no dramatic change to our "defense" spending.

One can only conclude that the Soviet Union and "threat" of communism was not the real reason for our decades of excessive military spending.

 "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy." -- US ambassador to the USSR and famous State Dept. geo-political strategist [George F. Kennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan). 




 Bill Gates' wealth equals the combined wealth of the poorest 120 million Americans, or 45 percent of our population.

 "We may have democracy in this country, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both." -- US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis (1856-1941). 




  US foreign policy has always been pretty much about supporting the most stable political entity in a region,

US foreign policy is about supporting governments that will (a) follow American orders on important geo-political and economic issues, and (b) allowing US/western corporations free reign to run rampant in their country.

 It has nothing to do with supporting democracy or human rights etc. Its all about the economy...

Aside from that "following orders" point, I completely agree. The US would prefer some neo-liberal "democracy" to rule, but you're right: It's not about any of the moralistic rhetoric that is the PR propaganda. As we've proven many times, the US government has no problem working with brutal dictatorships or fascists.

We've seen this recently when the Bahraini dictatorship shot unarmed pro-democracy protesters and admitted to widespread torture. Obama had no problem at all supporting the Bahraini dictator and supplying him with the weapons to commit his crimes. 




 I can understand the guy's generic argument about insulting or not insulting someone.

But his rhetorical claims about "double standards" and "the truth" are just that -- rhetoric and are pure opinion. The guy then uses that rhetorical foundation to go on to "support" his opinions on a variety of topics.

Overall, I thought it was a meandering rant with no coherent consistency. 









  how dare those racists help South Africa catch a known communist and terrorist.

Exactly! People like Mandela fighting against injustice should have been supported.

Instead of our the US government *supporting* and working with the racist South African regime, we should have been supporting the ANC and the freedom fighters to overthrow the minority white government.

But that would have been hard to do considering the outright Jim Crow apartheid racism practiced in many states in the US at the time. 




 I thought the most important thing here was the issue not directly addressed:

(a) How the US -- and remember, many states were based on flat-out Jim Crow apartheid racism then -- supported South Africa and worked closely with that evil regime.

(b) The headline' quip of "Can the story be told now." Doesn't that *scream* of self-censorship by our government and mass media? This immediately causes one to wonder what sort of crimes our evil government and media are hiding today.
