 That line cracked me the fuck up.  I just relived it, thank you.  




 I just meant there's no way they profit 50% on the hotdogs. I didn't realize there would even be a profit margin on them.  




 There's no way 




 Yea, I agree 




 Well, come on, regardless of their pasts, white characters inCrash come out on top. It may be subtle, but the two white characters we are made to hate, turn out to be the ones we forgive.   




 A remake of Michael Jackson's ["Dirty Diana" by Shaman's Harvest](https://youtu.be/1NHV6NUEKNU) 




 Yea, you're not missing much by not seeing the movie.  *rip aliyah* 




 This Is The End.  I know people just *love* this fucking movie.   I thought Michael Cera was the funniest part. 




 Get help man,  you deserve to be happy.  




 What movie do you deem hilarious? 

 




 I think a lot of people cringe at the white guilt manipulation-a-thon. 




 I used to think those monologues were epic.  




 It is so over-the-top. 




 You've gotta crow, and you gotta crow now! 




 Aw man, don't tell me that. 




 -marcus, score us some nacho chips and some radical salsa.

-dude.

-none of that green stuff.

 Queen Of the Damned 




 They are expensive, so I definitely understand a boppy being a luxury.  But know that it has a purpose beyond breastfeeding.  It helps great with tummy time and propping baby up to sit, possibly more.  




 No one ever told me how much a newborn scratches up their face... so bad,  be prepared. 

Edit: Plus, I agree, those muslin blankets are so freaking awesome. They are so stretchy, light weight, perfect to use as a nursing tent or to swaddle.  

And living in a hot climate, it's nice to have something that is breathable to drape over her carseat.  




 Jesus. Thank you for the warning.  That sounds like a nightmare.  




 What does it feel like?  




 I watched that film a long time ago, I remember it ending with having what I thought was a decent understanding of it.  

Now you are making me question it, and I don't remember it well enough to help you figure it out.  I'll have to watch again.  Maybe someone will come in here and help us. 




 The puppet in Puppet Master that spit leaches into people's mouths. 




 I was outside of my garage one day and this dog walks in to say hi.  Looked very similar to Mr. Lady,  matted up like crazy, and she seemed really thirsty.  This dog looked like she had been homeless for months.

So I got her water, checked for tags, no tags.  Took her to the closest vet to check for a chip, she had one!  The owner lived 5 houses away from mine.  

I was happy to return her to her family.  When I got to their door, they didn't even know she had gotten out, and they weren't even that excited to see me with her.  It felt wrong leaving her with those people. 

I should've helped that dog.  OP, I just wanted to share that story, but I think you're doing a great job.   




 You captured a beautiful moment!  




 It can be really hard to make these kind of people feel your pain.  If he has a victim complex, you just really have to know how to approach your conversation.  

It's hard to baby them, but I feel like you'll get through to him more if you make a point to recognize the little sacrifices he makes, then discuss your struggles.  I feel like that makes all of your strengths and sacrifices more measurable, he needs to really see *all* you do.  It does take the role of a really strong woman, your kids are lucky to have you.  

I feel your pain.  




 Oh wow, I'm so sorry.  

Does he throw tantrums once in a while and text/say stupid stuff, or is his disdain for you just mounting and mounting?

I'm not too sure how your mom is, but if she is offering to help you more, I'd take it.  You really sound like you're reaching a breaking point, you need to let the ones that love you help you.

He definitely needs a kick in the ass and start contributing more to your family.  If he can make 3 kids, he can help raise your 2 kids.  It sounds like you're having to be the strongest person all the time, and I know that is tiring.  

Try to see things through his eyes.  It must feel like shit to not be able to provide for your family.  Maybe he's taking a little longer to feel really paternal and maybe he's resentful that he can't act youthful and free.  

I have no sympathy for him, but seeing through his eyes will at least help you communicate and hopefully resolve some of your issues. 




 You can get ringworm, too. 




 This is the disturbing truth.  Makes me sad.  




 You should comment in more places.   




 Wow, love it.  




 Thanks

 [For you](http://www.imgur.com/EvFgwzc.jpeg) 




 Thank you a lot!  




 Thank you!  




 Thank you, you too  




 :') to me, it's still surreal 




 It's a great feeling,  :) 




 Thank you :) 









 ...Hangover 3 version of Vacation. 




 That was the best movie I've seen in a long time 




 I just saw this on Brain Games! 




 Pfft, *Kevin*. 




 Man, the way he finds out blew me away.  

There are 24 usable hours in a day my friend, you can do both lol 




 You have *no* idea what is in store.  I'm excited for you, lol.  Now stay away from this sub for now. 




 Your sentences ran on and kind of all went in different directions.  Take the time to really explain your story in one comment so we all have something to reference, and so you don't have to keep repeating it. 




 It has plug-ins, you need Firefox  




 Aww, gorgeous boy! 




 Thank you, I *never* had childcare in mind.  It's not completely about the money, I just always wanted my daughter to be watched by people who love her.

 




 We see eachother at night.  But no I don't see him a lot.  It's not ideal, but we don't pay for daycare.  

I don't know why it's so unbelievable, couples have to do what they have to do. 




 My husband and I have opposing shifts, it's not impossible unless you're both trying to hold down 2 jobs each, then I'd understand. 




 Thank you!  Carter's, and Baby Dior 




 Aww, good luck, xoxo! My lo keeps having a blocked duct and crusty eyes.  How did you know surgery was necessary?

 Oh my god, so adorable! 




 I agree with what they said.  At this point, you can't spoil them.  It is their primal nature to be against us.  Do what makes them happy, and worry about them sleeping by themselves later. 




 [I just think of this post](http://bunbunmakeuptips.com/my-horrific-post-facial-experience-you-need-to-read-this/), please check it out

But I don't have a personal opinion, I've never had one.  




 I second putting breastmilk on it until you see the pediatrician!  Those little bumps could be anything.  But you'll find out tomorrow, good luck!  




 Yum! 




 No.  Pizza! 




 Thanks for checking back in, he looks great.  Such a trooper. And he's gorgeous!  




 Like [this one, belly couture](http://m.bellybandit.com/index.php/catalog/product/view/id/154/s/couture-npd-m/?bellybandit_size=52 color=NPD size=7 gclid=Cj0KEQjw6tepBRDLqLnxouaY_pkBEiQAPIOiBnYrVaf9H8R9fLrb4R89pBs_Lgo3GWHdrtlQJl_IkcQaAqCy8P8HAQ kwid=productads-plaid%5e120475147751-sku%5eCONPD%253AM-adType%5ePLA-device%5em-adid%5e65039190911), only it doesn't make you feel so sexy lol.

It has strong velcro, it's very simple. 




 After my c-section, it just felt good.  I never looked into any other purposes they serve, I was just given one and wore it, and I loved how comfortable it was. 




 Interesting.  Very helpful, thank you!  




 I pump about 4 ounces of milk for her while I work.  But when I get home, my mom tells me she hated the bottle, and would only eat a total of 1 oz all day. I use Tommy Tippee bottles.  Someone told me today that I should try the crappy rubber kind the hospitals use.  Not sure what to try next, she just loves the boob. 




 I'm so happy for you!  Hoping to be there soon... 




 Thank you everybody.  I have wanted to capture this face for a while, and today DH was there to do it!  









 Same exact thing for me, also hoping it doesn't last long. 




 Creepy internet hugs to you OP. Those people remind me of [this video](https://youtu.be/Me9yrREXOj4), warning happy sad. 




 The looks you captured are priceless  




 I agree with the muslin blanket.  I bought, what I thought, was a lightweight scarf/cover, too heavy.  I prefer the muslin blanket.  




 She's just beautiful!

 Have you heard the [Primus](https://youtu.be/X9uk9IcoQ0w) version?  The demon's part in that one is incredible. 




 Oh man, you missed *Denmark*?  They managed to make a season worse than Mexico. 




 [Oh yes](http://www.imgur.com/yql2A7Z.jpeg) 




 Thank you very much. Good luck with everything.  




 PHRASING! 




 You're a sick mother fucker mac.  




 I haven't found anyone to talk about this with.  Slightly going insane.  How old is your LO? 




 Each time I got pregnant, we tried for a whole year.  Be strong, and patient.  And if you're not already, start with the prenatals.  




 I don't go to as many shows as I used to, but all the venues I still go to, Ticketmaster isn't affiliated.  I go to House of Blues, no Ticketmaster, The Joint at the Hard Rock, no Ticketmaster.  I *would* boycott that shit if it was any other way. 




 Well that's funny.  Makes sense now.  




 I live in Vegas, and every time there is/was a show, I'd go straight to the venue and wait in line there for tickets.  I would never give in to Ticketmaster prices.  Out here I never encountered a venue that didn't sell directly to you.  I think I would have boycotted the venue, fuck Ticketmaster. 




 The people that gain large amounts of weight, or people that sustain a really high, unsafe weight usually consume such a large amount of calories that they *can* make a huge weight change by limiting calories.  But I agree that it is more healthy to maintain a balance of both consuming low calories and exercise. 

 




 I wonder how the rights to music work, and whose decision it is to pull it.  Because the bitch that sings it should be eternally grateful for that kind of exposure. 




 It was on Netflix for a while and I watched some episodes, they had changed the opening song.  It was a different song, and almost of equal annoyance. 




 good looking out 




 I just posted this before I saw yours, I know I thought the same thing, I'm confused. 




 [I thought this lady was always the voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Questel) 




 Yea. I was in the hospital last month, and the only way they'd let someone else have any say, is if I was unconscious, or they had power-of-attorney over me. 




 I was going to say, nobody beats that guy yet. 




 I got distracted after I clicked to watch it, and was pissed cause I thought I'd miss the punchline and have to rewatch it... but it was still going. Long-ass gif. 




 The song by Silversun Pickups called "The Pit" made that word more alluring to me. 




 I was very happy to see him reoccurring.  His character is such a badass. 




 That's a good one.  When Finding Nemo came out, I thought I was going to hear a bunch of folks in my generation reference *Little Nemo*, but no.  It was a good movie.  




 That was very good.  Definitely Seth Green's awkward stage!  




 This movie made me love Jason Lee.  His humor and timing is just perfect. 




 Great movie.  There are a few movies that I feel helped shape me during my formative years, this is definitely one of them. 




 I've recently been told to watch this.  It looks good.
