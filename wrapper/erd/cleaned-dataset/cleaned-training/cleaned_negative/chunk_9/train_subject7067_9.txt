 super honest question, jenna the autistic one seems completely normal.  So why do you admire her?  She seems like a decent normal girl.  i couldn't discern anything from the two without them continually telling me the other is autistic. 




 Nice try slipping that by, you were caught.  I applaud your attempt at a graceful exit. 









 Still remember Chick Hearn shoutin' "Nick the Quick!" 




 This was SUCH a great watch, caught a private link of it a few months ago, really opened my ignorant eyes to some NFL history. 




 To re-iterate their failure...I will take NY GM Phil Jackson over the mess that was Mike Brown and Mike D'Antoni, and just for some nostalgia coach Dell Harris.  Lakers have had some pretty shitty ass coaches for such a great team, every time my team gets some shit coach, we're in for trouble.  Great coach really matters, the players will come, but who the fuck wants to come for Mike Brown or honky Mike D'Antoni.   




 Again, the mere fact the terms of the contract allows Goodell to be Arbitrator does not supersede Goodell's inability to arbitrate fairly or Mr. Brady's right to due process.  He can be unfair if he wants, but that doesn't change that whatever he rules doesn't have to stand, if Brady doesn't want it to, this can go both ways, either way it just won't hold in court.  Goodell would be wise to prevent Brady from taking this to Federal, yea right he's in way too deep and if you just look at the past, he doesn't have a clue how deep he's getting himself into. 




 The main fucking point is Goodell inserted himself as Arbitrator, which cannot in anyway be consider fair.  Hello?!  Not rocket science here..whether or not you agree to the CBA that he is the default-arbitrator, it just doesn't hold up that you can be fair in that scenario.
