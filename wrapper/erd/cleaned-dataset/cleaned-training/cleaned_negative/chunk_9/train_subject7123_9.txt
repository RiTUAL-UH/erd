 It's from an zoo in germany that got abandoned like 5 to 10 years ago. It got abandoned, because the tenant had not enough money to pay the rent and the landlord was not willing to lower the rent. The zoo itself was first focused on birds and later it developed to a adventure zoo. The terrain itself is about 17ha (about 170,000m or 1. 829.864 feet)
