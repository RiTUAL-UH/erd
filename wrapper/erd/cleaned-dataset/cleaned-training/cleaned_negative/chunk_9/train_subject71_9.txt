 Same with Kyle Busch. His is green and the rest of his team is brown. 




 FNG??? 




 I take it as if it gets archived due to the fact it was placed without permission the fault of that falls upon no one other than yourself. 




 Just ask here. Since a mass majority of us use it i'm sure you could get it fixed. 




 MOTHER OF GOD! 




 Jumping on the c:geo wagon as well. You can see everything on it and I mean EV-ERY-THING. 




 Knew multiple people that knew Taylor, and when they put the word out about the car being found I rushed up. I'm the big guy they kept showing on 2. Anyway I hope they hang this fucker by the nuts and let us take him out the same way. 




 Nice St. Louis Co. representation. 




 HA! GOT EM! 




 Poor Mountain Climber. 




 Glad to see I'm not the only one. 




 I always love when you tell them that and they call you the dumbass like yeeeeah ok. 




 [The Cache I Want To Find The Most](http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1MDCE_jolly-green-giant) 




 I really really need to buy stock in the foil industry. 




 Same here. I wasn't around here then. 




 Makes me wonder if the chiropractor or Johanna caches. Nice attention to details matching the paint. 




 Live right by this church and it has always given me bad vibes. Best friend would always say she heard it's like a cult in there, and I always blew it off like yeah ok sure but now I see she might be right. 




 /r/DIY 




 Reminds me of a water bottle on a hamster cage but with a music box. 




 The question that everybody wants to know: Does she wipe her own ass?

Don't lie you were thinking it. 




 That is exactly the outfit I was picturing when I read "not graphic covered shirt. It's all about dressing the part and not standing out too much. 




 They are yet they're not. Some are listed on the site but it's few and far between 




 If the black hole/tube was in the ground prior to you placing the cache I would say no. 




 They will do an investigation. Mine went through and as soon as it went through the money went back in.  




 Only thing I can think of when looking at the size you need is a Magellan eXplorist GC or a Garmin Chirp. 




 Pretty much. Found one by an old WW2 jet we have on display in my town, actually signed up to the site, and never touched it again. 




 Not only that but last year we had the tracking system that told you what place you were in based on when you found all of them. Hopefully that doesn't return this year. 




 Jack The One Armed Bandit 




 It took me a day to get my money back and that's only after chewing out a supervisor. Originally it would have been 7-14 days. Also as a precaution went to the bank and filed a fraud report thus getting a new debit card. 




 LMAO at the As Seen On TechTV button. Ahh those were the days. 




 Kill it with fire. It's the only way. 




 Not To Self: Buy shares in the foil industry. 




 I second this. Files are already made though some need a lil tweaking. 




 Well Thank You Captain Obvious. 




 Image up top on here changed too. 




 That's exactly what it sounds like. Well we're not sure he's our guy, but he complied with us putting cuffs on him. 









 What did the apology say exactly? 




 First thing that popped into my head was dildo. 




 3   5 




 Count me in. #ByrnesStrong 




 If we all put in $10 we should cover it.

Who's with me? 









 Porn and guns. 




 Mine did too. Got charged $50. Called corporate and the supervisor was like no we don't have a data breach and I wanted to scream bullshit. Got my money put back into my bank account and got a new debit on the way.

It was a digital card BTW. 




 Was never really taught flow. Usually just write what's in my head. 




 If I remember correctly I believe this was a redemption product using the UPC code. 









 Besides the fish WTF is up with the dry ass brown corn? 




 That they do and Slacker's usually gas some good ones too depending on location. 




 Usually for 10x more. 




 Add a place to add a hook and I have me a new Christmas ornament. 




 The dipshitness is strong with this post. 




 All the down votes must be from Hawk fans. LGB!!! 




 Looking for Code Black. Not able to find any free versions of the film. 




 Calling bull as well. Sounds like a plot for a made for TV movie to me. 




 Heeeere's your sign. 




 WHY!!!!! 




 You and me both. The strange side of the internet right there. 




 Well from looking at the other comments I'm not the only one who thinks he's F'n stupid or an idiot. 




 Unless the banks are different over there than they are here it could also be used to withdraw. 




 I then sendt my bank account info (BIC, IBAN, etc.).

This is the only part that made me shake my shake my head and scream in my head ARE YOU F'N STUPID. 




 Now those are my kind of hand-me-downs. Very beautiful guns right there. 




 Technically we have but Amendment 5 was just passed in November banning counties and municipalities from banning the right to. 




 Broke as a joke and the joke is broke so the only game I really have is GTA V on PS3. If any of y'all ever feel like playing go ahead and add me. PSN: Itsmy6 




 Missouri: Now With Open Carry.....For Now. 




 Out of nowhere:

**STONE COLD STONE COLD STONE COLD** 




 **BAH GAWD!!!** 




 My first video game Hogan's Alley. :') 




 Looked it up and it's just what I thought, it's a fake/morph but a very very good one at that. 




 I don't ever remember these two being pregnant. Any more from this set? 




 Hi Mom :D

 Violet Blue/Noname Jane in case anyone was wondering. 




 I don't think I ever missed an episode. 




 KaBlam from 90's NICK. 




 First thing I thought of when I heard Cavebob Spongeman:

 Unfortunately I can't since the site it's on is banned on reddit. But this here is part 1, part 2 consists of her getting back from jogging, and part 3 is if her getting ready to go out and the "brother" pins her hands behind her back and stuffs a sock in her mouth. 




 Mandy Flores 




 Still no middle finger though.  




 Could also be Steak n Shake. 




 Thinking the same thing. lol 




 Actually 3 and she does a ton more B/s bids. 




 OH YEAH! 




 Come on press it no one will know. I mean all the cool kids are doing it, and we all wish we could be like the cool kids....like the cool kids. 









 Ok good thought I was the only one. 




 Congrats 




 Hell today they're 1/2 off during happy hour so have fun. 




 Wow this is a new one to me. The ones I've seen she looked about 5-6 months but here I'm guessing she was around 8-9 months. 




 "FINISH HER!!!"

"Toasty" 




 That's reason enough for me. 




 "Oh fun it's the DirectTV Information Channel" 




 Oh Happy Day! 




 And Hillary Clinton shares her email provider with millions of Americans. Failing to see a point here. 




 Damn that name brings back some memories. 




 Going to wager a guess and say because there's nothing else to do there. 




 Head Meet Wall 




 Hey Dad look what I won at Boy Scout Camp: Most Cuddliest Camper. 




 So...they pay big money for them to go back to preschool basically? 




 Haha same 




 "How To Find The Hole" 




 "I'll teach you to laugh at something that's funny!"
 




 Found this sub through the sidebar ad and was a fan of Whose Line through the Drew Carry era. Not that big of a fan of the current version. 




 Have It Your Way (Unless it's too damn complicated.) 




 Congrats 




 Just hang out in NYC until that morning and then call in a bomb threat that morning thus prompting an evacuation. Yeah some officers may lose their lives but it won't be as many as there was on the real 9/11.
