 Damn. That's depressing. I would never want my kids to go through this. 




 How likely is it that my kids would be autistic? 




 I'm not really interested in getting help because I would feel bad. I don't consider it a handicap or anything. I do recognize the issues but I feel like I live a relatively normal life compared to people that are worse off than me. On that note, if I could get scholarships because of it that would be so great.

 I got a 42 but I'm not sure if it's even worth looking into. I just feel too old to be able to do anything about it if I am on the spectrum.
