 ...It got better... 




 Hah!  Some of these responses are pure gold.  
  
  I'll try my hand at one.. "Aliens? Naw. They don't exist... ...I'm tracking Bigfoot!" 




 Capslock.. Its like a cruise control for cool... 0_0 




 You crossed the *fe*line on that one..  
  
  I'll show myself out.  :-) 




 I'll just leave this (old) pic here..

 I believe in french, the equivalent is "Gicle" in modern parlance.  




 Looks like a HF vertical antenna of some sort.. Perhaps something for the 80 meter band?  
  
(I'm a licensed HAM operator, so, I'll just leave that right here :-)  )  
  
  
(P.S, Could possibly find out more, and even ID the make and model of antenna over at /r/amateurradio) 




 The soundtrack to this movie (T. Reznor, and A. Ross) is wonderful as well. Perfect ambient tunes to listen to when coding, or writing. 




 Crap..

Just missed it..  
  
  I'm in Sheboygan, and only a 3 hr or so drive from there.. Got all wrapped up with the work stuff a full week early, but already have my ticket home tomorrow.  
  
  
  Should have told them I needed to stay out here another week, and driven out there to check out the B B, and shack.. :-) Maybe make some friends, and finally find myself an Elmer!! :-D
