  the director thought it was better than having a high schooler

The director doesn't understand the character well enough then. Peter Parker was a bit of a child prodigy, and while he's not quite on the level of Bruce Banner, Tony Stark, Reed Richards, or Charles Xavier, he *is* one of the most intelligent humans in the Marvel Universe.

"Particle Man"

Which is lyrically similar to the old Spider-Man cartoon which started, "Spider-Man, Spider-Man, Does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size, Catches thieves just like flies. Look Out! Here comes the Spider-Man!" 




 Technically, the "webs" from the symbiote are just pieces of the symbiote itself which it can regenerate over time. For example, when overextending himself with "webs," Eddie Brock-as-Venom was left partially exposed because there wasn't enough symbiote suit left to completely cover him.

The symbiote learned the composition of Spider-Man's webbing and was able to mimic it

 Iron Man is secretive about his tech because something on par with the latest Iron Man suits, especially if one used them to equip a small army, could potentially become a global threat, as in a dozen or so Iron Men could seriously take over the world.

A whole army of men with web shooters isn't nearly as dangerous. They have way more non-threatening potential uses than threatening ones. 




 In America, you can buy machine guns, flame throwers, and even a tank. I don't think commercially available web shooters would even be in the top ten of our concerns in terms of citizenry-owned weapons. 




 I don't remember the movie very well, but I'm going by the comics where he definitely invented them.

So an unscrupulous person would have to get a sample and work fast, but it can be done. 




 In 2004 and for a few years following he had organic web shooters which was probably an attempt to reflect 2002's blockbuster Spider-Man film. I'm not sure what the canon or real-world explanation is, but he went back to the mechanical ones after a few years. 




  It would make it much more difficult to maintain his secret identity between getting paid and IP protection

He could just give the schematics and formula to someone like Tony Stark or Reed Richards, have them patent it, and have their guarantee of the profits or at least a percentage. 




 When everyone has web shooters, no one does... 




  it's not any more than a kid without autism

As someone who worked in a school for children with Autism, many of whom lived on campus because their parents literally could not handle them, I cannot stress strongly enough how incredibly wrong you are.

Most parents don't have to live in fear of being viciously attacked, the acts of self harm, having constant supervision to make sure they don't eat something they're not supposed to, having to physically restrain your child so they don't hurt themselves or others, bolting, or a myriad of other autistic behaviors like low functioning "children" who are near adult age and can't wipe after using the toilet, *if* they make it in the first place.

[Here's one tiny example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_23z9yJAq0) These parents likely go through this and things like this multiple times a day.

Educate yourself before spewing such wanton ignorance. Such nonsense is a slap in the face to every parent who has had to endure raising a severely autistic child. 




 I can't even begin to imagine all the real world applications that webbing would have, from search and rescue teams, non-lethal force weapons for police and military, mountain climber safety, tracking and capturing wild animals without hurting them... 




  I would never call "That was Then. This is Now" a sequel of "The Outsiders."

*You* wouldn't, and that's fine, but it kind of is. It's got the same setting and even shares a few characters as I recall Ponyboy being directly involved.

You raise an interesting point, though. The concept of a "shared universe." S. E. Hinton does this as does Bret Easton Ellis, and there's got to be a better word for something than "spin-off" or "prequel/sidequel/sequel" for stories that take place in the same universe and may even feature some of the characters but aren't directly related to the other stories. 

For example, both Marvel and DC Comics have numerous shared universes, but this month's issue of Batman isn't necessarily a sequel to this month's issue of Superman even if Batman's issue comes out after Superman's and even takes place chronologically directly after. If one's story doesn't impact the other's, it's not really a sequel, is it? 




 Except that monsters and ghosts are dismissed as obvious hoaxes yet nobody bats an eye at the talking dog...

John Cleese subtly killing it on Letterman 1988

John Cleese is the subject. "Killing" is the predicate. "It" is the object. "Subtly" is an adverb, i.e., a word describing an action. The only action indicated by the title is "killing (it)," in this context a phrase meaning "entertaining an audience." Therefore, "subtly" is describing the way he is entertaining, which is humour, therefore /u/aperfectly_cromulent is both correct and perfectly cromulent. 




  Better Call Saul is a spin-off of Breaking Bad, not a prequel

It's both.

[Better Call Saul is an American television drama series created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. It is a prequel/spin-off of Breaking Bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul)

The terms are not mutually-exclusive. If it concerns characters and a "world" from the same series, a spin-off happening before the events of its parent show is a prequel; if the events are after the parent series, it is a sequel. If the shows have an overlapping timeline, then it's a parallel spinoff called a [sidequel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_%28media%29)

 Group hate is cathartic, and before you go knocking it, consider the value of like-minded people circle-jerking their hate all over each other until they're sticky with each other's loathing. Sound like something you don't want to participate in or even see? Good. Then it's best they have their own little separate place for it, right?

Personally, I think anyone who wastes their time foaming at the mouth with their burning hatred of fat people is an awful example of a person, but I loved when /r/fatpeoplehate existed because it meant not having to see it spill into every other thread whenever anything remotely connected to the issue is passingly mentioned.

 I can try to get the original photo to confirm if you're interested. 




 Even the ones that are good... aren't. Like the unified Pixar theory everyone gushes about. What Pixar is actually doing is putting back references and future references (because they plan ahead) in their movies as fun Easter eggs for fans. Instead, people come up with this facacta theory piecing all the completely unrelated movies together as if each is a sequel or prequel to another in a long series, which is obviously not true if you give it an iota of critical thought. 




 It's also exactly like a lot of other weak theories that try to connect a similar actor, like Leonardo DiCaprio's characters from Titanic, Shutter Island, and The Great Gatsby are all the same guy.

 Coincidentally, I recently read Hemingway's *The Sun Also Rises* which chronicles a trip to the Festival of San Fermn in Pamplona to watch the running of the bulls and the bullfights. I never knew much about bullfights, only that I was against it because of the killing of the bull and using animals for entertainment in general. What I learned was deplorable. Granted, the book takes place at the dawning of the twentieth century, but I was truly appalled. 




 Aside from the way technology can warp a voice, there was a particular standard of pronunciation and stuff called the [Transatlantic Accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_accent) that was used widely for broadcast and theatre purposes for a long time. It was learned (meaning it didn't belong to a specific area and no one spoke it as their native type of English) and it incorporated aspects of standard American and standard British accents. We still have certain standards for radio voices now but it's more about projecting your voice and speaking clearly, rather than with a certain accent.

The metaphor is that Superman is a god and Batman doesn't believe in him, not that he doesn't exist, but that Batman doesn't believe him to be a god. It's not that Superman believes himself a god either; just that he's thought of as one for obvious reasons. Note the trailer with the statue and the cult of believers. 




 This meme has nothing to do with God or religion. 




 Irrelevant discussions.

1. There have been many, *many* interpretations of Batman in the comics alone. I couldn't begin to list everyone who has ever written the character, then there's the movies, television, animation, video games, etc. He exists in literally hundreds of continuities, canons, etc. The writer dictates their interpretation, and Batman has been portrayed as Christian, but he also been portrayed a non-believer.

I'll repeat, as of 1995, according to the [US Census Bureau, 50% of people who identified as indigenous preferred the term American Indian, 37% preferred Native American, and the remainder preferred other terms or had no preference.](http://www.census.gov/prod/2/gen/96arc/ivatuck.pdf) You may well have met all 37% of the total number of native peoples who prefer "Native American," and that's dandy, but it does not argue my point that the term "Indian" is not offensive to most Indians. You've done nothing to disprove that point. 




 I expect we'll get it, and to be fair, the first actual DC Cinematic Universe movie was Man of Steel and is so far the *only* DC Cinematic Universe movie. Everything prior was its own separate canon. 

That being said, I don't consider Man of Steel dark or brooding; it was simply as realistic and grounded as a Superman movie could possibly be. It was also made specifically as the set-up for Batman V Superman, which itself is the set-up for Justice League, so I consider it groundwork-laying more than a great narrative in and of itself. In other words, I don't think Man of Steel can be judged fairly until we better understand how it fits with the larger narrative.

If anything could be taken away from that film as the WB approach to comic book movies, it's doing them in such a way as to ask, "What if this was actually happened in real life?" whereas Marvel tends to more openly embrace the most comic book-y elements apologetically. 

Naturally, some people prefer one method more than the other. I personally like both for different reasons, but I do solidly believe that Spider-Man 3 and Amazing Spider-Man 2 both managed to kill their respective franchises for the same reason; they were too over-the-top stupid for their own good.

You can definitely go too far in either direction.  




 Someone should notify Thailand's tourism industry that some people apparently hear "Thailand" and immediately think "pedophile."

 I find it weird that OP thinks using the phrase "consenting adults" is a strange thing to say, or even worse, suggests pedophilia. I've used that phrase about a million times when defending my position on same-sex marriage, as in I don't care what consenting adults do so long as they're not hurting anyone. 

WTF does "consenting adults" have to do with pedophilia?

 Also, the Thai subtitles on the video are consistent with Gale's music choices which are demonstrative of his idiosyncratic and peculiar personality. He is a fan of foreign language music and apparently speaks fluent Italian. As an example, as he waters his plants in his apartment, he sings along with Quartetto Cetra's "Crapa Pelada." A jazzy song, the Italian lyrics of Crapa Pelada are a bit of a tongue-twister because of its incredibly fast tempo. 

So I find it perfectly believable that on a trip to Thailand, Gale created a film version of himself performing a camp karaoke version of Peter Schilling's "Major Tom (Coming Home)." He also had a picture of himself on Mt. Everest which is less than 3,000 miles away. 

Other possessions in his apartment included vintage cameras, a mask, a potato battery, a water pipe, a copy of Stephen King's *Everything's Eventual*, Jane Austen in *BOCA*, The Waverley Novels, *The Magnificent Activist: The Writing of Thomas Wentworth Higginson*, and *Fundamentals of Marxism Leninism*, which is odd for a Libertarian. His apartment also contains a pair of skis and a surfboard. He enjoyed drinking both coffee and tea. In Gales Lab Notes, along with the Heisenberg formula, he included a list of top ten recumbent bikes, a recipe for vegan s'mores, indoor composting tips, and a Far Side cartoon where the scientist is about to pop a paper bag behind the one working on the nuclear warhead. 

I'm not seeing anything that suggest pedophile.

 Fun facts (for anyone wondering):

The T. Rex comes from an adventure on "Dinosaur Island" (Batman #35, 1946); the penny was originally a trophy from Batman's encounter with a penny-obsessed villain named the Penny Plunderer (World's Finest Comics #30, 1947). Other "keepsakes" in the cave come from "The Thousand and One Trophies of Batman!" (Detective Comics #158, 1950). These three stories were reprinted in Batman #256.

Other pieces often shown in the Batcave include Two-Face's original coin, one of Deathstroke's swords, the shroud of the vampiric Monk, and over-sized ten-pins.

He has also had Fries' original freeze gun, a piece of Kryptonite, and old partner costumes.  




 If you like brightly-colored, jokey, fast-paced, explosion-filed punch-festivals with thin plots and nothing to have to think too hard about, Marvel movies exist. They're great, entertaining popcorn superhero flicks.

There's no point in having two different brands if they're just going to make the same movies.

I like the darker, more serious, more thoughtful tone of DC's movies. I'd rather watch The Dark Knight 100x than see Age of Ultron a second.

 Being against racism isn't politics. 




 So by that logic, we could have a team called the Washington Slaves and use a strong, black cotton-picker in chains as the mascot and that would be okay because it's honoring the mighty, hard-working negro slave of American history, not the modern day black American.  




 Their mascot is offensive, and you could argue that naming a team after a ethnic group at all is in poor taste, but "redskins" is a racial slur whereas "Indians," though an obvious misnomer, is still popularly used by Native Americans and non-Native Americans alike.

In fact, as of 1995, according to the [US Census Bureau, 50% of people who identified as indigenous preferred the term American Indian, 37% preferred Native American, and the remainder preferred other terms or had no preference.](http://www.census.gov/prod/2/gen/96arc/ivatuck.pdf) It may have changed in the past 20 years, but I can't recall ever once hearing American Indians refer to themselves as "Native American." 




 I know you're being sarcastic, but if enough people of Scandinavian descent felt that way I'd be all for changing their mascot as well.

 That's not true at all. This man has enormous balls which provide both weight and balance. It would take strong gale force winds to blow this man off balance. 




 She played "Disgust" quite well in Inside Out. 




 American here; I've been spelling it "grey" my whole life, it's my favorite color, and my daughter's middle name. 




 I had to check IMDb to see if this was a joke or not.

It's sad how totally believable that was...

 Definitely wasn't talking about professional food photography, but rather the type of photography [Instagram is synonymous with](http://editorial.designtaxi.com/news-instamenu1610/6.jpeg).

Food photography can be excellent, but it's beyond clich these days to take a cell phone pic of your food even when it isn't visually interesting.  




 Reminds me of what Dylan said about Hendrix' version of "All Along The Watchtower."

Dylan has described his reaction to hearing Hendrix's version: "It overwhelmed me, really. He had such talent, he could find things inside a song and vigorously develop them. He found things that other people wouldn't think of finding in there. He probably improved upon it by the spaces he was using. I took license with the song from his version, actually, and continue to do it to this day." 

In the booklet accompanying his Biograph album, Dylan said: "I liked Jimi Hendrix's record of this and ever since he died I've been doing it that way... Strange how when I sing it, I always feel it's a tribute to him in some kind of way." 




 It is an American thing. As an American I would say Jason Alexander played George *on* Seinfeld; he was also *in* Pretty Woman. 




 "The first time [Nintendo's lead game designer Shigeru Miyamoto] played with the controller, because hes working most of the time on Mario 64, he would have seen Mario 64 with it. It wasnt so much that controller dictated Mario 64, it was just that was the game he was working on. Mario was the way of testing it out. Probably more the other way around. The actual movement of Mario came from the N64 controller, the way you move the central stick."

 Giles Goddard, Super Mario 64 programmer

[Source](http://pixelatron.com/blog/the-making-of-super-mario-64-full-giles-goddard-interview-ngc)

"I think thats a misnomer to say that the N64 controller was designed around Super Mario 64. Yes, Mr. Miyamoto wanted analog control because he had a vision of how he wanted that game to work, but the controller wasnt designed specifically for one game."

 Jim Merrick, Technical Director at Nintendo

 Good to know I was wrong, but understandably wrong. It hurts my ego less.

Robert ***Towery*** (correct spelling: Before he died, Towery broke down in tears, apologised to Jones's family and his own family, and said his life had been one mistake after another.

'I would like to apologize to Mark's family and friends for what I did to them. I would like to apologize to my family,' Towery said.

'So many times in my life I went left when I should have gone right and I went right when I should have gone left. It was mistake after mistake.'

According to the Arizona Republic, he looked at his family and began crying, before adding: 'I love my family. Potato, potato, potato.'

 I'm not going to fact check all of these, and some of them I know are correct, but I was baffled by Clarence Ray Allen's and Wikipedia says:

Allen wrote in his final statement, which was read immediately following the execution, "My last words will be 'It's a good day to die. Thank you very much. I love you all. Goodbye.'"

None of this "hoka hey" nonsense.

 I believe the kids are calling them "selfies" these days. 




  mute swans

As opposed to talking swans? Or am I just stupid and that's a species of swan? 




 I want to believe you use bodily fluids as adjectives with worrying frequency.

5. Food. 




  Jerusalem cruisers

I've never heard that one before, but from now on, I'm carrying that torch. 




  this level of ben-day dots typical of '85 comics

Not typical of the Marvel comics prints, but of newspaper print, which this was trying to emulate, i.e., the Sunday funnies.

 Google alert is a good idea. I'm just surprised when there's a website out there for damned near everything there's nothing for a comedy release schedule. 




 It says 69 for me. I don't know why you're seeing 79. 




 Same here. How are people seeing different numbers? 




 For example, there are websites I go to for keeping up with movie and music releases. I'm having trouble finding anything anywhere that does the same with standup comedy specials. 




 100% correct. X-Force goes into one of the many post-apocalyptic futures in circulation and run into Deadpool. 




 too op pls nerf 




  His change throughout the first book is for the better. He's grown above what society made him and become what society could be.

The only part I would argue is that I believe he was *always* better. From the outset he knows he's being manipulated and hates it. From the very first violent encounter, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, and of course, the people watching his every move *could* intervene, but they don't, and this recurs three more times.

When he's at the lake and Valentine visits, he's done. He's had it with everyone's shit and she has to talk him into saving a world he's not convinced is worth saving. He sees the military that's been manipulating him as his real enemy and refers to them as such. He always doubted that he was on the right side and never felt in control. Valentine later confirms this on Eros telling him that no one is really in control of their own destiny and that she has manipulated him and was manipulated herself.

The end of the book proves what he suspected all along and also proves that he has always wanted to do the right thing and will search the galaxy to do so. The bugger queen obviously knew he was pure of heart or she wouldn't have created the elaborate set-up for her infant queen based on what she saw in Ender's mind.

I see the story as being about an inherently good person who is too powerful a tool not to be misused. He's like some well-intentioned nuclear warhead that doesn't mean anyone any harm. 




  The follow up books are a thought exercise. A philosophical rambling

I've been known to enjoy those things as well... 




 From the moment the character was introduced I liked Bean and wanted more. Knowing that the Shadow series follows him, I'm definitely interested. 




 This is the 25th time. 




  they gave away the big twist pretty early in the movie

That's unconscionable! My jaw dropped when the book got there and I thought it was especially clever because I expected 

***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** 

the remaining pages to be filled with the *real* battle. I thought it was clever to leave so many pages toward the end of the book for exactly that reason so I never saw it coming. I wouldn't imagine the end would have nearly so much impact if that were revealed early-on. 




 I would have felt that way, but I thought they did a good job of trying to justify everything by the end of it, revealing motivations, weighing what "doing the right thing" actually meant, 

***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***

finding out that the buggers not only weren't evil, but they were never even going to mount a third invasion because they realized they were fighting sentient life and would extend forgiveness and hope to be forgiven; they had no way of knowing.

Earlier parts of the book hinted that they might have just been wanting for a means of communication. Ender I think was likeable and did have a sense of morality in that he tried to understand and love them--he even used those words--and was used as a tool against them. He didn't even know he was killing them when he did. Hell, he never knew he was killing anybody at the time when he did. He felt bad about things. He was a good kid with a ton of talent who was used. So was Valentine. Disagree with Graff all day, but he thought he either was doing the right thing or else at least believed he was doing whatever was necessary. 

As to why anyone was worth saving, Valentine speaks to that best of all when she's telling Ender that it's all these individual lives and relationships throughout the earth that they don't even know. The reader knows, because we're them. We're just regular people trying to live our little lives while psychopaths vie for power and risk the lives of everyone on earth over money, land, power, etc. On that note, I found it very relatable. Change the existential threats, rework the politics a skosh, and scale down the technology a little and you've got a fairly apt parable of what goes on in the real world today. 




 I still cannot believe how utterly enthralled I was during every battle session and even practice sessions... and there were so many! You'd think they'd get tiresome, but nope. 

Also, in terms of a few "holy shit" moments that didn't seem the least bit gimmicky, I've read few books that pulled it off so effortlessly. 

I could say more, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. 




 I had never even considered that the username is like "brand" and that multiple people may have the login/password to post as such. Thank you for the perspective. You must be right or else the work would be like a full-time job. 




 5/5: All I asked was that it live up the hype. It did. For those of you who haven't read it, the less you know about it, the better.

Apparently there are fifteen sequels, which kind of blows my mind. Reading them would put off reading much else for a while, so if anyone can speak to the quality of the sequels, please do inform.

I'm now kind of curious to see the movie, but after looking at IMDb and RT ratings, I'm not sure I want this experienced ruined by a shitty adaptation. Any thoughts from those who have read the book AND seen the movie?

**EDIT**: Thank you for all the helpful responses! 

**EDIT** 2: I can't respond to nearly 2,000 comments, but I *am* reading them all. Thank you so much! This is why /r/books is my favorite sub! 




 The only time I see that as being appropriate is if a women's sub outright asks a question like, "Men of Reddit; what turns you off on a first date?" or "My husband is being unusually quiet; should I be worried?" that would make total sense for men to answer.

Personally, I wouldn't be in a sub called /r/TwoXChromosomes to begin thanks to my pronounced "Y." 




 Ah. I never use /r/all, just front page so only my subscriptions show. I've unsubscribed to anything that isn't relevant to my interests, and I guess I just assumed others do too. 




 So a major player like Yify for example. Where does he get all his movies, TV shows, etc. from in the first place? Surely he's not buying them all. Then the time it takes to rip everything in varying levels of quality, upload them... it seems like a huge investment of time for some of the bigger names out there. This is all just done out of the kindness of their hearts?

 Seems lot a lot of work and risk for no reward. 




 No, it will mean we've innovated ourselves out of needless labor. 




 This really deserves to be higher. These aren't even emotions; they're thoughts. There is a difference. There are only six or seven emotions at the most, and even those can be reduced to four core emotions:

1. Anger/Disgust

2. Fear/Surprise

3. Joy

4. Sadness

"The realization that each passerby has a life as vivid and complex as your own" isn't an emotion; it's a epiphany or a passing thought. 




 I'm with you. I used to hate playing with shitty Brian Gagnon because his controller had "turbo" buttons and he'd just sit there turbo punching and fucking up my day.
