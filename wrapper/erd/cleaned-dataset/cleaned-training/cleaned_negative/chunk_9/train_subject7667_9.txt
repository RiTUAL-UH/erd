 Hi everybody!
I downloaded the latest update last night and i was playing through the game when all of a sudden it just froze. My car froze and the road disappeared like in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2eByv8odws. Also while i was driving through Castelleto the buildings and road starting disappearing and the game froze again. Is anybody else having this problem? Any tips to fix it? Thanks!
