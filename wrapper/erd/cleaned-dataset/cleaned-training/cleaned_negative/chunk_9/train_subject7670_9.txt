 No, not on purpose. Although the new versions since Orbit got ahold of them are numbered.

Ah yes, the "no recap" thing. Man, I might be the only person in the world, but I can't stand recaps. No matter how subtly they're squeezed into a story, I always end up turning the page and saying, "yeah, no shit, I just read that." So I decided to write mine almost like one big story that had been cut up. Now, you're not the only person that finds that annoying, so maybe I'm the asshole here. That's quite possible. Something for me to think about in future works.

It wasn't a hard decision to end it at all. In fact, it wasn't really a decision. I had intended to end it at three books. But about halfway through the third book I realized there was no effing way I was finishing this big of a story (because it was very big in my mind) in the pages I had left. So then I just wrote until the story was done. Which ended up being six books.

The current covers are not me. The previous covers when I was self-publishing? Yes, those are me.

Thanks for reading! 




 Hahaha! I dunno, there may come a time when he needs to be resurrected... 




 I'm glad you found me! I love getting cross-genre interest!

You know, I actually tend to take aspect of people that I like and fuse them into my villains, because I just think that's more realistic.

The only real exception to this would be Jerry, because he was just a picture of every worthless politician out there.
