 My friends started a thread on Facebook a couple years back after Dragon*Con and we were thinking about what panels would be offered at a Fedora convention.  The best title I could remember was "How Feminism Did 9/11 To Men's Rights"

I tossed m'hat in the ring and added "Hoverhand Ballroom Dancing" 




 Aww lookit the diddle duders!

 This had me squirming more than the average /r/WTF post would. 




 Fuck that, roofie yourself and save the bar cash for cab fare when she takes you up on the coke binge offer. 




 Why is he fully dressed? 




 I take 2g a day, usually Tuesday through Friday, for work. I don't do it on the weekends because I have massage school and it messes with my ability to apply a consistent pressure to clients. For some reason when I come in on Mondays I prefer not to do it. I go through periods where I don't want to taste it on my palate since I drink it. 




 I just feel like people should try to answer his question instead of just dropping kneejerk snark, if you're going to correct his grammar, bring something else to the table so you're not just being off topic. He had a question. Let it be answered and give a little tutoring, don't just be rude. It makes us sound like pedantic jingo assholes. 




 Preach 




 Wow guys, way to show how pedantic we are to those who are ESOL. 




 How so? 




 And this is why the answer is actually no. 




 Yea I don't like the tenor of the comments board up top.

 Yea don't think I could stand to but you should go listen to some Meshuggah. It'll help with digestion of this stuff. 




 That first song has quite a few measures of 5:8 in it with quarter time counts above it, so you hear that offbeat-onbeat effect when it runs. It's just little measures of different lengths.. riffing.. riff salad, hardcore metal stuff. 




  comb front page posts from a couple weeks ago

 post them again

 ????

 karma 




 heard that.  Good hunting 




 If you're not going to move it from track 9, then set it to track 9 and then right click on the track selector itself where it says "9" or "- -" and select "init song with this position" - It's possible you did this by accident while it was set to none and that's why you're having this issue.

Check your browser [F8] at left and then go under Current Project - Initialized Controls, and check for that Massive plugin having inits, delete if not needed

 I feel the same about the stress triggers and annoyance. They happen, you feel the gun click but there's no bullets and you just move on with your life. I did have to stop drinking coffee so much but beyond that it has been great as a stress tonic and mood lifter. I also pop out of bed and run hard until I sleep basically every day. With a 7 day schedule on my plate it is invaluable. 




 That's Anti-Semitic.
