 Awesome, good on you. I have a little one on the spectrum and ABA has made a world of difference. I was at first scared but with the passing days of therapy I can see hope, he acts more and more like a neuro typical is astounding and fun to watch his growth. I would say he acts like any other little boy.  




 Go get an official diagnosis to find out what it may be? Most colleges have pediatric Psychologists that will diagnose for free. Whatever the diagnosis is best to not put off therapy of needed. Don't be scared, you have to be brave for your child.  
























 It's a cycle, stores will raise prices until customers stop buying as much then they will come up with something clever like the $5 footlong.  



















 What happened over at /r/AMA ? They no longer allow celebrity AMA's.

 What ever happened to those glitter bombs?  




 Amusing to read the clever names that sprout up.  




 When the Supreme Court ruled on gay marriage recently , there were at times three and four duplicates from different subs on the front page.  




 Often there are duplicates on the front page from different subs that are up voted. I don't see anyone removing those.  




 Definitely, I'll check that out. I would like to lose weight and keep it off, but the diet part is the toughest obstacle for me.  




 A lot of young kids are diagnosed with hypertension but I suppose you must want to change, it must be really difficult, good for you.  









 They need Pied Piper.  














 Congress said it was for for the military to continue research on uniforms if they were already underway.  









 How much are 2 day 2 Park tickets. We have express passes for two days but want to enjoy both parks and not be in a hurry.  




 Any of the on site hotels except cabana.  




 Thanks! About how many rides did you go to in one park? I've heard it gets really full so I though maybe we would only have time for like 3 or 4 rides. Thanks for the help!

Even with the unlimited express? I would imagine one ride every thirty minutes. Less than fifteen to stand and line, five minutes for the ride and about ten to walk to next ride and that's over estimating.  









 We need to change the banner to honor Victoria? Any suggestions?  




 Higher or lower than the President Obamas'?  














 Lol 




 We need to hire Richard Hendrix from Pied Piper to take over for Ellen Pao.  



















 All the mods should walk away, and let them mod themselves.

 This isn't the first time this has happened, I like his response where he said we'll help you via going forward, isn't that the same old story?  




 He needs to be reeled back in, I agree.  









 When BRAC happened a lot of people built homes on the premise there was going to be a housing shortage, no one really came and rental prices are high as a result. You may want to look in Pennsylvania or Delaware, a bunch of coworkers commute from there, about 20 minutes. You get more for your dollar.  


































 How can I get all of the coolant out?  




 Ok thanks.  




 Would you have a photo of what I'm looking for. I think I would just need a ratchet?  




 I called the local jiffy lube and they said not possible, can only be done by machine. Up sell?  




 It's time for a radiator flush and instead of paying $80 dollars at the auto center I'd like to do it myself. Is there a drain plug under the car I can unscrew, fill it with the flush liquid, drain it and fill it with coolant? Sounds simple but not sure where to start. 









 Amazing, keep up the great work, I know its difficult but very important. 


































 /u/only_100kcal what type of services does your son receive? I have a son with autism and he receives ABA in the home. Most of the schools that we have attended are hopeless, they claim to offer ABA principles but don't instruct properly. I particularly like Florida, they mandate BCBA's in the classroom as long as the parent is paying for them. My child was receiving ABA services in the classroom and has shown so much progression. 




 Defense Mobile does not throttle users but simply cuts off their data access if they exceed their allotments. Most of the companies have a higher threshold than Defense Mobile.  




 If data and price are your goals, Sprint and Tmobile sounds like what your looking for. Sprint has no limit at $60 and Tmobile at $80. Really depends on what your looking for.  














 Here are the plans, for these prices your better going with a known provider like AT T, Tmobile, Sprint. Depending on your locality, depends on your service. https://shop.defensemobile.com/plans
