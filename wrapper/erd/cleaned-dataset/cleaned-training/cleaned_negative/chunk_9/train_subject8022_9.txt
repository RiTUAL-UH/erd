 They are not dropping in price THAT fast. For example I bought a 480GB Sandisk SSD from Amazon in December for $179, and when I look at the same drive now on Amazon and Newegg, it's around $170. 

Be happy with what you have, as it's completely normal to watch prices drop after you buy the latest and greatest hardware. 




 I think $1500 was my out of pocket limit back then. Insurance covered everything else. 




 Whenever it happens, and if they are cheap, I suspect birth rates in developed countries will plummet. Especially for individuals outside of a marriage/long-term relationships.

Many of the guys I know who had kids when they were in their 20s did so because either they didn't want to wear a condom due to reduced sensations, or because their girlfriends forget to take the pill (or in some messed up situations told them they were taking it, but actually were not).

I'm hopeful that a pill would help reduce unexpected pregnancies across all populations, but for some of those that don't use their brains, I can't see them popping a pill everyday when they can barely pull their lives together. 




 I was in the hospital for almost a month in 2012 and my bill from the hospital itself was $174,000. But for the life of me I couldn't figure out where it all came from. The labs/imaging bills were separate, and when I talked to the billing department they weren't sure how to make sense of everything either... I had a bill for the same thing from two different providers. It was a clusterfuck.

Thankfully insurance saved me. But holy hell it seems like it's a headache for everyone involved.  









 This will surely calm racial tensions in this country... 









 $50 says this guy's favorite movie is Fight Club. 




 Staring straight ahead, taking a long swig and then slowly setting the glass back down on the table... before saying "... know your secret."

Someone like that would have a lot of secrets, and is probably pretty self-centered as well. Who wouldn't want to know what secret someone knows about them? It'd buy me time so I could finish my beer. 




 "Ask not what your country can do for your goddamn self... Ask what you can do for your motherfuckin country!" 




 I'm not sure why this is viewed as such a bad thing. If you take away the digital factor would people have problems with it? For example if the cops had a board of flyers with some criminals on it, and were standing at the entrance to the festival with their 'eyes open' to spotting any of those people... would there be such an outrage? 




 90 and I still feel like I'm teetering on the brink. I guess I should free up some assets if I ever want to dive into a pool of gold coins like scrooge mc duck. 




 I've seen dogs do this when they aren't normally allowed somewhere, but they are finally given a free pass. They refuse to make eye contact too because they still thing they are breaking the rules. 




 ISIS thus far hasn't shown any urge to try to take territory in Turkey. By opening a direct conflict with them it risks spreading the ISIS battles to Turkey. Plus Turkey sees the Kurds as a threat to the Turkish State and as long as the Kurds have their hands full battling ISIS, Turkey likely sees their threat level as reduced. 




 Turkey is a great ally to have in the Muslim world. But I'd like to see their current leader pushed aside by his people.

If you want a jackass ally, look to Saudi Arabia. That's an ally that should be an enemy IMO. 




 I don't think that's a fair comparison at all, the people of Turkey are predominantly secular in nature. It's their current government that's back tracking on their freedoms that made them a model Muslim-majority secular state.  

I feel for the people for Turkey. They tried to rebel, but were hit with an iron fist, and now Erdogan is actively removing those that oppose him from high positions in the military, politics, and even journalism. 




 This is also something I've searched for in the past. There are not many services out there because regardless of the service you need to have the other person's bank data and/or they need to sign up for an account somewhere (paypal/etc) which is too much work to ask of customers.

A lot of banks have easy ways to send out electronic checks, and I've found that is the simplest. I also use something offered by Chase called Chase Quickpay. The recipient still needs to sign up, but they only sign up once and the money gets transferred directly to their bank account in the future. 




 Such containers aren't re-enforced well enough to be buried safely, and they would also need to be waterproofed and prepared for the elements. For the size, and the amount of work (re-enforcement, etc) required with a cargo container, it really makes more sense to build a concrete structure using re-bar or build a wide structure with steel. 




 Depressive / bipolar meltdown might be more accurate for what she's having... High functioning autism isn't defined to include such episodes, and typically has muted emotional responses rather than such excessive ones. 

Whatever the cause, a dog makes it better! 














 What does this have to do with the Iranians? Their coup was nothing like the Turkish one. It was put into play by foreign powers, the Turkish one was home grown. 




 Looks like he wants to lay down a different type of pipe.

 Modern Turkish history is full of coups, there were two successful coups not long before the one in 1980. The 1980 coup would have happened regardless of American involvement, and based on previous history it was almost guaranteed that it too would be a successful coup... so I don't think the US can be blamed for causing such a change, as it was inevitable.

Erdogan's biggest fear is of his military leaders, and he has been cracking down/removing senior leadership. When Turkey goes too far in the wrong direction, the military usually steps in. 




 IMO, there are a lot of variables left out that are required to give any kind of reasonable suggestions. Like:

* What's the location?
* How much time are you willing to invest?
* How much are you willing to sacrifice before making a profit?
* What kind of skills do you have?
* Do you have income outside of this 40 grand?
* What's the least amount of profit you'd be happy with say 5 years down the road?

It's not a simple/easy question. There is a lot more than money involved when it comes to creating a successful business. 




 Much of it has been completely rewritten based on what I've read. To the point where it can really be considered a separate entity.  I'd say it's a relationship much like the original half-life engine GoldSrc and the Quake engine (which HL's engine was based off of).

But you're right, technically it still has some gamebryo in it. 




 It was released in 2011, it's almost 5 years old, which is pretty major mind trip to me. 




 They used a different engine in Skyrim which was developed in-house. Skyrim has beautiful graphics and it's the first generation of their new engine. I think their next Elder Scrolls game will be just fine without Unreal. 









 Sounds like a lot of fun.

I had a girl go into a yelling rage when I told her I bought a house because rents were skyrocketing and it now made more sense for me to buy than rent... I don't understand the people that get angry at individuals in the tech industry. It's not like we want to drive prices up, or want others to suffer. 




 Techie hate in Capitol Hill and neighborhoods around UW are reaching epidemic levels. Now when people ask what I do for work I generically tell them I'm in engineering, because if I mention software I know it's likely I'll hear an earful about how tech people are driving up housing costs.  




 After politics was removed as a default sub it started to leach out into other subs. Browsing the default subs is no longer as fun and relaxed as it used to be for me. It seems like every other post is a post that intends to get some kind of reaction out of users like "look what this company/person is doing?!?!", "our rights are being taken away!", or they are something like "check out this video from a talk show host talking about something political!", etc etc.

I've started to find myself going full circle. I'm actually using Digg again because of all of this political/sensationalist nonsense. 




 Whether cop shootings are justified or not, this is not a new pattern in the US, and the media/feds seem to put a very high focus on those involving minorities... It makes me wonder at times if there is an effort to sew discontent and chaos in this country. By who I do not know or wish to speculate, but you could not ask for a better campaign to cause tension in the population.

 I don't think the reason they are homeless is because they can't afford a home on the median salary. 




 It happens in the States too. I don't blame the Chinese individuals (doesn't everyone want to make money?) but it is very frustrating. I lost out on two houses when I was searching to buy because investors put down an offer of cash that I could not compete with... 




 I think it's partially because while they are generally safe barring tremendous external forces or operator error... nobody wants to live by one. I am all for building new nuclear power plants with the latest designs, but even then I would not want one built near me. So unless they build them in the middle of the desert, the reaction from nearby residents might be overwhelming enough to keep them from building new plants.

 After the Snapchat clients got pulled I thought about leaving, up until that point I've never had a problem with lack of apps. I'm really hoping Snapchat builds a client for Windows Phone 10. 









 Walmart is a big believer in Tesla and is one of their top customers for batteries that are supported by the Solar City company (of which Tesla is associated).

It seems like this article is all about making connections between companies and their own agendas. Just because the family is invested in a company building solar power plants that wants to survive its competition (at home solar panels), doesn't mean they are anti-solar.   









 It hasn't been a military dictatorship for day to day politics. The military has upheld a secular Turkey in the past when leaders have moved away from it. I would say the reason Turkey has remained a model secular state for so long is BECAUSE of the the military. As Erdogan has gained more and more power he has targeted some existing military leadership as 'opposition' and worked to lessen there power... I'm hopeful the military will step in at some point and warn Erdogan against making more anti-secular moves.  




 "Sorry, I'm busy and don't have time to talk at the moment" - and walk away 




 No, as it was a mistake it's neither income nor gains. It's not going to show up on any tax forms, and obviously you wouldn't count it as income yourself. 




 Turkey used to be the model secular majority Muslim state, Erdogan is quickly changing that... 




 But a lot of utilities are building/testing batteries for Wind and Solar installations for example, so it's not clear if some of the wind/solar energy (or any energy source) gets counted twice (once being generated at the installation, and again coming out of the battery). 




 Seeing "batteries" on a chart of sources of energy production seems really odd to me. 




 Playing video games by yourself. When I was younger when somebody asked me what I did the previous night, saying "just stayed at home and played some games" was totally acceptable. But as I became older it's not something I really want to admit to, because I feel like as an adult I should be doing more productive things.

 I don't understand all the hate Big Bang Theory gets. It has made it "cool" to be a nerd/scientist again. Regardless of the humor, I have a feeling there are probably more young people interested in science with The Big Bang Theory than there would be without it.

 I payed 450k for my house a few months ago, and now zillow estimates its value is 530k. It's amazing how quickly prices are skyrocketing. 




 Why do people have to be assholes? She was an asshole for screaming and making a scene, but the guy videoing it is also an asshole for instigating and mocking someone who is obviously in distress. The only good guy here is the cop.

 They have rising nationalism at home. Such nationalism needs conflict or the sense of conflict to grow, and Putin probably would not stop short of war to continue stoking the nationalist flare. 









 That's why I blamed the "scientific publication community", ie: the publishers. If well-known respectable publishers don't enforce quality standards equally across their publications (conferences included) and don't hold publishers they partner with accountable, it's a fault that should absolutely be addressed, but it doesn't seem to be. 




 That's precisely my original point. In this example, both IEEE and Springer are very respectable in the community, but they and other publishers don't apply their review processes in a consistent manner to identify fraud. And in cases where fraud research is found to have been published, they should make the changes to address it. I don't see indications of that happening. 




 They were not scam journals, unless we are thinking of different incidents. This is the incident I'm referring to: http://www.nature.com/news/publishers-withdraw-more-than-120-gibberish-papers-1.14763 . Though I wouldn't be surprised if there are more. The publishers included Springer and IEEE, both of which are well trusted publishers:

 Ruth Francis, UK head of communications at Springer, says that the company has contacted editors, and is trying to contact authors, about the issues surrounding the articles that are coming down. The relevant conference proceedings were peer reviewed, she confirms  making it more mystifying that the papers were accepted.

 The IEEE would not say, however, whether it had contacted the authors or editors of the suspected SCIgen papers, or whether submissions for the relevant conferences were supposed to be peer reviewed. We continue to follow strict governance guidelines for evaluating IEEE conferences and publications, Stickel said. 




 I read it. I'm not suggesting just the journal itself should have caught it, but rather that the 'research' became so prominent across media and people in positions to correct the misinformation didn't really question it. 

It's not just infamously bad journals publishing fake papers, it's been a problem with other journals as well. A couple of years ago a CS team at a university created a paper generator and submitted the papers to some well known and generally trusted journals, and the papers were published even though they were non-nonsensical.

 




 If the scientific publication community didn't quickly identify this as a sham or even questionable, it makes me wonder just how many papers are published that contain false research where the author(s) **didn't** want to get caught. 




 It took me a year of searching for houses and making offers before I had my offer accepted (and only because the previous investors who had their offer accepted backed out). That was in February, and I paid around $450k for the house, which is not very far off from what the value estimate was on Zillow. Now 3 months later the value estimate is $530k, and a fixer-upper house down the street just sold for $500k. It's an absolutely crazy market right now. 




 The police must be frustrated. Mexico officially lacks capital punishment, and it seems each time federal forces capture and jail cartel members they either escape from prison or are released by the corrupt.

 




 I grew up on a farm and we used multiple gopher exterminators and they always killed them. I think no kill services are probably more common in highly populated areas. 














 The issue here is that energy weapons are banned via "international rules of war" against enemy personnel. So laser attacks against infantry would be 'banned'. IMO the military should just do it anyway to reduce collateral damage, but a superpower ignoring international weapon conventions would not set a very good precedent.  




 I wish the US government would change our Middle Eastern policy and give more recognition to the potential benefits of an Iranian ally. Though it's very far from perfect, Iran is actually very moderate now and is far more in line with our principles than other allies such as Saudi Arabia. If we were to base our friends and foes upon principle, Saudi Arabia would be one of our top enemies.  









 Most family farmers need subsidies to survive and be able to produce food for others. The ones that don't need subsidies are the big corporation farms (usually created by buying out family farms). I wish more people understood this... Family farmers are not getting rich off the government. Even with subsidies most still struggle.
 




 Though at a certain point the composition of the atmosphere would take effect, the primary factor behind tree lines is temperature. At a certain point it becomes too cold for the species to survive, or there is too much moisture that remains as snow cover for them to get started.

The atmospheric composition statement can quickly be debunked by comparing altitudes of tree lines across different regions. In tropical and warmer climates you'll find trees at much higher altitudes (in many cases all the way to the mountain tops), where as in colder climates the tree lines will generally be much lower. If the primary factor were atmospheric composition you'd find tree lines across the world were much more uniform in altitude. 




 Awesome. Thanks, this is very interesting. I have an neurodegenerative illness based on autoimmune disorder. I may try something like this just for experimentation sake. Have you tried it before?  




 Do you have sources? I like to keep an open mind, but I'm very skeptical of such a thing having even the slightest positive effect on immune system function. It sounds like pseudo-science.
