 Is it just me or do the Fox announcers sound like golf announcers?  





























 Would TCU make a better traveling partner for Texas instead of Tech ? 

 




















































































 Why is playing BYU a lose/lose situation ? 

I take it there is no interest in starting a rivalry with Utah State? 

 









 I agree, it would be nice for tOSU to have an in-state rival 

 














 TIL Lenox Square used to be an open air mall  





























 Don't forget the Red Sox !  









 I'll admit that I don't like the fact that there are Confederate generals carved into the side of Stone Mountain from an optics prospective, not the optics of the carving itself (it's actually pretty cool)  I don't like having to explain to people from out of town who those people are and why they are memorialized there. That said I don't think it should be removed.  



















 No idea, the Website liked is for the San Angelo (TX) Standard-Times. So it's legit . 

 














 I worked in my college dining hall that was managed by Aramark. There were roaches in the dish room crawling on the clean dishes . 

 
























 the fish was even dryer than the chicken  

















































 hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahah. Unionized employees at a small liberal arts college in Georgia? HELL NO  



















 I worked in the dinning hall my freshman year. The catered food was better than the stuff they gave the students (though not by much). There was one time I was told the cut beef so I went back and grabbed some. But it was the steak that they serve to catered events. I was told to put it pack and get the proper meat for the students, which was like 15 pounds of solid meat with about 6 pounds of it being fat. I had to cut all the fat off before I could even start cutting the meat that was on there 




 They did the same at my school. They threw left overs on the pizza or made a sandwich out of it. The options were meatloaf sandwiches and macaroni and cheese pizza  




 I went to a small school. Meal plans were required to be bought if you lived on campus and were included as part of room/board fees. 

 




 The employees were some of the nicest people you'd ever meet. There were several older ladies that that adored the students and the students loved them back. It was the Aramark management that was shitty and only cared about cutting corners whenever they could. Even the employees there acknowledged that the food was awful.  












































 Aramark was in charge of my college dining hall. It was awful  




  Fox's contract for the B1G title game will also expire when the current ESPN contract expires . So whoever the B1G signs on with will get the championship game 

But I do agree that I don't see nbc signing on with an exclusive B1G contract as football games in the fall would probably interfere with their EPL and nascar coverage . Now if it's a shared package (ala the pac 12 with ESPN and Fox) then NBC might sign on 




 Fox announcer "that looks like a hand ball" no shit Sherlock
