 Not quite as good as Bush did. 




 Not on purpose but yes; tremendously. 




 That would be awesome. I tried to search for a tall building on the equator but all I got was proposed structures. So in another 20 years you could do this for sure. (ha ha) 




 Reality arriving. Right on time.

 Cool. :D 




 Commenting to hear the answers. It's getting so hard to find one. 




 Just fascinating. I mean it is obvious that the sky would appear to travel in a different pattern if you were at the poles than if you at the equator. Just didn't occur to me. 

Thank you for that. 




 We have trolls here that downvote everything. Don't take it personally. Thanks for trying to help. 




 Excuse my ignorance but I was fascinated by how the whole sky turns in a 360 circle; Like a wheel. Is this  how the sky appears in the polar regions as opposed to how it appears more towards the equator. I mean here it seems to pass more like a line.

 




 Yet you guys attack me week after week. Looks like you are the one that needs to get over something. 




 Oh what a surprise, our weekly attack by Suitandtie, jenzgomesthe 3rd (oh what ever account she has now - she has so many I can't keep track) and matthona.

All three have been attacking assistance because I banned them from our sub for harassing users. You guys go ahead and have  your little circus again. 

As for me and my subreddit, we will go on and help thousands and thousands of people like we always do. Have a nice weekend. 




 Yes I think this is a democratic plot and it is working brilliantly.  




 This from a man who received four student deferments and a medical deferment, according to military records on file with the National Archives and Records Administration.

 That strawberry rhubarb pie must suck.  




 Ye it is the administrators' bot. And yes they are unable to differentiate that these are not spam.   




 Yes I am sure they can but they don't. I am amazed you think I am the one doing the harassing. This person is getting people shadow banned every day in my subreddit. And I am the one harassing him? He is harassing people. He is abusing his spam rpeorting privileges.  I can contact them in regards to the shadowbanned person and tell them what is happening. Only the person being shadow banned can.  




 Actually that is not the case. he reports it. And their bot shadow bans them. No one is reviewing these cases.  




 You had to make a brand new account to say that?

So I will assume this is you.  (namely /u/youhatemeandihateyou) You report people that are not spammers  and they get shadowbanned. I tell these people to  contact the administrator to get their account back and let them know who has abused their spam reporting privileges. And you think it is you that is being harassed? You are the one that is harassing people. You have gotten over 100 people shadowbanned just for making a post in my subreddit. And you are the one being harassed?  




 So my entire subreddit is spam all of a sudden? No one is emailing anyone. It is what my subreddit does. We help people. We have been doing it for five years and because of one person doesn't like it, all of a sudden it is spam. And it's people just asking for advice as well. They are spammers now too?

 #AWESOME! 




  Our country would be a lot better off if both parties stood up for Americans as much as they do Israeli Jews.

Amen. 




 Marking this to see the answers. 




 Some are but most aren't. He absolutely targets my subreddit. He goes through it daily.  




 It really sucks. They only get banned because he reports them and then the bot does it. Over 100 people have been banned in the last month due to one person. He is singling out my subreddit. It is just not right. 




 Is the dress blue or white?

 What do you do when a user is abusing his spam privileges and reporting things repeatedly that are not spam? I have one person who has gotten over a hundred people banned from my sub simply for making a single post there.

 Will do. Hope you have a blast. :D 




 Done. 









 You blame him? 




 Post over in /r/norcalhiking. The mod /u/sconce2600 really know his stuff. 

Actually we are camping at the Lost Coast next weekend. Why don't you join us? 




 We are not the ones you need to tell.  




 Because we can. 




 Bush sure as hell had something to do with messing it up. 




 Yes he is. And a very nice one too. Years ago I delivered some antiques to his house. He was a sweetheart. Gorgeous too.  




 Shhhh..., don't tell anyone. 




 Well we were on that list six and a half years ago. I wonder what (who) happened? 




 Yep. All five of them.  




 Good thing we have Obama. Or we'd be on that list too. 




 Don't worry GOP. Latinos love Donald Trump. I know this because Donald Trump told me so.

Vote for Donald! :}

 Yep. There is bad stuff everywhere and it seem like all that people notice sometimes. But here we get to see the good stuff everyday. I can tell you for a fact, there is much more good than bad. :D 




 Oh the comedy that become of it. We would be the laughing stock of the world. 




 That people need to throw away the bibles, the constitutions, the laws and everything else they depend on to do what is right. My god people! You know what is right. Stop using shit to justify what you are doing wrong.

 Why do people live back East where hurricanes and tornadoes hit all the time? There is always something. 

And by-the-way, that big earthquake has been supposedly coming now for decades. I'm sure it will eventually but we have too many others things to worry about in the present to freak about something that may never happen in our lifetime.

And this year it is drought. Next year it will probably be floods. It's always something. You can't escape it. 




 Are you kidding me? Cruz was never running for the top spot. Those two need to get a room. If the Donald happened to win the GOP nomination, we all know Teddy would be his VP-BFF 




 I spent $46 filling up my little Dodge Neon yesterday. I nearly shit my pants. Going to have make that tank last until the "problems" subsides.  




 I with you there bud. I'm tired of feeling like a California Raisin. 




 I can't tell you how happy I am to hear this. Just makes my day! 




 Yea they make these excuse like refinery problems or summer blend. But never in the history of gas prices going up has  a few counties been singled out like this. Gas prices prices raised $1.00 a gallon in one week. This is horseshit. 




 Great as always. But kind of expensive. Right now we are paying twice the gas prices than most of the country. They have some sort of mafia that controls the gas prices here and are reaming us hard. Paid $4.20 a gallon essayer for regular. 




 Depends on how hard the handle is. :O 




 Oh  my god, I feel like such a fool. I got the 20" one. 




 We recommend that with anyone making a request. 




 Do the have 20" long shoehorns? 




 Yea international might be a problem. Within the US it's great and ismuch cheaper. 




 Media mail rates are the cheapest

 If things are going well I doubt that he would dare to. It would political suicide to start the fight once it has been already stopped. But you never know.

 It will take a decade or so for that to become apparent. But it will be the case.  




 Another Sanders proposal that sounds good on paper but in reality has no chance of happening or succeeding. Sanders is quickly becoming the Ted Cruz of the democratic party. Yes unicorns sound awesome but reality doesn't include them. 




 That is good to hear. Last thing we need is partisan politics screwing this up. It's time to put an end to perpetual war in the Mid East. This is a good first step.

 With a 2/3 vote. The same thing that had me worrying they wouldn't pass it, has me quite confident that no veto will happen. 2/3 of them agreeing on anything is highly unlikely. 




 Whew! 




 Thanks for the info. It scared me to think that we were going to have to depend on congress to agree. That would doom it for sure.  




 Oh okay. I feel much better now. Like congress would agree to even rename a post office. Good to hear. 




 TIL learned Boehner has a mind. 




 I hope you are right. I just worry because of the republican controlled congress. 




 I agree with you there. That is why I am so concerned congress will screw it up. I'm just wondering how capable they are of doing that, and how likely of a chance they will succeed at doing that. 




 Can congress successfully kill the deal? And what are the chances of that happening?  




 Same here. I was disappointed. Still trying to come up with a punchline. 




 Pretty much sums it up. 




 Hey I got my 20" shoehorn I always wanted.

 It wasn't me spewing any kind of hate. I was saying that is what Rick Perry was calling him. 

You know the kettle calling him black but it was obvious he meant something else. I was calling out Rick Perry for being racist. I totally support Obama. 




 The sale turned out to be a bust. I didn't find anything I wanted. 




 The kettle calling the pot nigger.  




  Those statistics mean nothing to me.

 Well Jimmy, you talk of the past. Answer  my question. What are we number one in? Shit what are we even number two in?  Or three. You can run around and shout 'murica until your face turns red white and blue. But the the facts and statistics has us in 30th, 40 and 50th place in the all the important factors. Those are called facts. And it is why America has fallen into such lows as it has never experienced because we refuse to see facts. Instead folks like you wave the flag and say we're number one! 
 




 So what are we number one in? And by-the-way grandpa, I'm 58 years old. I lived in the days we were number one.  




 The questions was what "if" Donald Trump....,

But since you insist on the debate:

 Absolutely. For the last six years all they have done is say no. That's all they know how to do. 




 America will finally have to admit we are far from the greatest nation on Earth.  




 You. You claim we should kill the deal. So what is the alternative? Your solution will guarantee they will get a nuclear weapon now or that we go to war.   




 Exactly. The ones that condemn have no other solutions. They are not  here to say what we should do, only to condemn others who offer answers. 




 I did not ask what did happen. I ask what would should we do instead of the treaty.
