 Saw that your budget was 2k so CUB-01 is completely within budget. 
So below someone mentioned planting Lavs around the car. This is a great idea, and with a recorder like the Zoom h6 (which has six isolated tracks instead of two on the H4n) you could separate each lav from one another in post, so when you go to mix your dialogue each lav is isolated from each other. You can definitely get a Zoom H6 and three lavs for under 2k.
I find that the CUB-01 is great for planting right above the mirror of a car. Fairly naturally sounding and its definitely a great option for the front two passengers.  




 Well I think the dream for every indie filmmaker is to get good quality audio out of cheap gear. 
I think one of the best mics for the job is the Sanken CUB-01. Renting it would be your best bet.
However if we are going super cheap there are other options. But I want to make it clear, that cheap will not sound as good. And because everyone always says " well that's okay" the difference between good audio and amatuer is right here. 
If you are using iPhones as recorders the Rode Smart lavs might be an option for miking talent.  If you are using the iPhones built in mic than put it back in your pocket because that will sound like shit.
If all you have is the one Rode video mic your best bet is to plant it somewhere in the middle of the driver and passenger seats. If you have to plant them out of frame angled towards different seats. Do you have any type of recorder? 




 I'm new to the game of freelancing and the real world in general (I just graduated). I'm starting to get gigs fairly regularly, and I want to get my taxes in line sooner than later.
Any advice on the subject?
I'm considering forming an LLC, does any one have experience with doing that or know of the benefits of it?

 




 Oh god. Seems like a great opportunity to teach your utility the importance of cable cleaning.
