 Explanation of what? 




 Dammit, I'm all out! 




 Will $2, a broken pen and some blue ink covered lint do? 




 Love it.... any chance you could mail me that wall? 




 Personally the only one there that I enjoy is the Power Armor one. 




 Maybe a group of raiders who've taken over the manor and are influenced by all the medieval stuff. 




 I would work on my strength if it means dual wielding big guns like Fatmans. 




 All you need is Boone. 




 Sounds like great fun I'm in. 




 There are also many mods dedicated to raising the companion limit. There's nothing as great as wandering the world with your personal army doing the work. 




 They're probably trying to balance it out, because once you slapped it on you were a tank who died to nothing. Also people have theorized that you could have an airdrop, drop you your power armor for when the situation calls for it. 




 Haha, have a clock to enjoy watching the seconds tick away. http://itsalmo.st/#fallout4_mcvnp 




 That's just pure nightmare fuel right there. 




 'Yeah what a loser'. Now if you excuse me I have to sit here refreshing the page every 20 seconds looking for new posts for a game that comes out in 140 days. 




 Thank you for putting the thought of HD Centaurs into my head... *shivers*  




 Not only that, but the random events that would trigger as you're walking around are awesome and keep you captivated and intrigued as to what will happen to you next. 




 I'd recommend finishing NV and then moving on to FO3, this way you can take the extra time to read notes, look at the little nifty details and take it all in, before moving onto FO3. FO4 doesn't come out for another few months so don't bother rushing, take your time with each and enjoy every little detail you can. 




 Haha woops, was a bit distracted at the time and tried to go off muscle memory :3.
