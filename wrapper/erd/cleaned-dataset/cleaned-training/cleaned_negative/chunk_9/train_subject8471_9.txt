 "And as a prudent man puts money by to serve as a provision for the material wants of his old age, so too he needs to lay up against the end of his days provision for the intellect. As the years go by, comparative values are found to alter: Time, says Sophocles, takes many things which once were pleasures and brings them nearer to pain. In the day when the strong men shall bow themselves, and desire shall fail, it will be a matter of yet more concern than now, whether one can say `my mind to me a kingdom is'; and whether the windows of the soul look out upon a broad and delightful landscape, or face nothing but a brick wall."

-- [A.E. Housman](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~martinh/poems/introductory.html) 




 So I just watched the Drunk History John Wilkes Booth episode, and found it fascinating, particularly the fact that he and his brother Edwin were famous actors, and his strong identification with Brutus.  Is there a good biography out there?

 Fair enough.  In that case I'll settle for pointing out his promise to vote against retroactive immunity for telecoms, then promptly voting for it once he got the nomination. 









 Ha!  This makes a wonderful companion piece to [Candidate Obama vs. President Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BmdovYztH8)  There's plenty of hypocrisy to go around.

 Yeah, but they're pretty strict about editorialized titles, and there's no current story that I could find. 




 I [tried this morning](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/23o5re/just_a_reminder_that_it_has_been_5_years_since/) but got no love.  Maybe I picked the wrong subreddit.

 Just got this Straight Dope in my inbox: [Do the British not rinse dishes after washing them?](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/3158/do-the-british-not-rinse-dishes-after-washing-them) which made me so glad we won our war of independence.

 Well, except about that "ending the war" thing, if you'd carefully read the article, he notes that Obama did his damndest to keep troops in Iraq:

The war indeed ended in 2011. But lets not forget that before (most of) the troops left, Obama begged al-Maliki to let U.S. forces stay beyond the deadline set in the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).

And then later, he took credit for withdrawing the troops that he had tried to keep there. 









 One time, I was in a Babies 'R' Us, and they had these little phones that you could speak into, and it would play back.  I recorded "You're adopted," for the next lucky kid to come along.

Wherever one stands on the "Jewish question," we think it would behoove our readers to applaud this particular Jew's open defiance of the ever-present white-shaming bully-brigade. Bravo, Jerry.
