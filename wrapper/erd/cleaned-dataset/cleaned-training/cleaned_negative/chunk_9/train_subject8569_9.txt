 Women with bushy armpits. 




 KHAAAAAAAAN!!! 




 "Dierdre, be a dear and pick that up, would you?" 




 A couple more.

 Wouldn't be the first time someone humped a Porsche. 




 Two questions:

1. iPhone?

2. How are you standing so close? 




 Did anybody hurl? 




 Probably Against the Grain. 




 Heh heh 




 Awesome album. 




 I listen to this one often! 




 My Dirty Deeds album was warped and I returned it to get this album! The etching was so cool! Too much time on my hands... 




 Heh! 




 Nice! 




 Fire it up! 




 Back in Black was my first tape too! 




 It does kick much ass! Good first buy. 




 Hell yes it is. 




 And I'm gonna keep on loving you! 




 And Posh was the hottest? 




 Oh boy. You might catch some shit for this one... 




 I prefer Murmurs a bit over that one. 




 I miss Cliff... 




 That sounds amazing! 




 Obviously! 




 So so. Favorites are Nofx, Bad Religion, Descendents, Social D, Rise Against, Offspring, Millencolin. 




 That's one I will never stop listening to! 




 Nice! 




 I listen to that one about once a month. The Who is probably my favorite band ever, pound for pound. 




 Pour some sugar on me! 




 Nice! Not nice. 




 I love almost all of their earlier stuff. 




 Who's your favorite spice girl? 




 Yup! 




 The amount of people ITT with the same answer is a testimony to its greatness. 




 Surprised I haven't seen a 918 around here yet... 




 Nice. I was in high school when AJFA came out. I pre-ordered the cassette. 




 I shall check it out! 




 It's so solid. 




 Record? Tape? CD? 




 Me too! 




 If getting jiggy wit it is wrong, I don't want to be right. 




 But which version of "Don't Cry" is best? 




 I hope you've gone back in their history to see how awesome they really are. 




 Nah you're good. I threw a Milli Vanilli CD out of my car window once. 




 Good on ya, mate! 




 You're still alive, she said. 




 Are you young? This gives me a little hope in future generations if so! 




 Very nice. I wore out Operation Mindcrime twice at least! 




 Why does a family die?

Do you care why? 




 Is something wrong she said? 




 Brilliant. 




 And it's the first album you bought with your own money? 




 Get off my cloud! 




 Great choice. 




 You have good taste! 




 Isn't it ironic? 




 Very good. I still listen to this one too. 




 Kris Kross will make you... 




 First time I heard "Super Trouper" I busted out laughing. 




 Crazy Train!!! 




 I still enjoy "I Could Have Lied." 




 I hear the Space Jam website is still up... 




 Yup, you're right, those were still around when I was 10, but on their way out. Thanks for the description of how they worked!

*In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida* will always remind me of the original version of Red Dragon called Manhunter. 




 Hey, I like me some singing pussies, too. 




 Good first buy, I say. 




 I didn't hear MCR until I was 35 years old and I still love them! 




 I agree, great one. But I really never liked the song Wonderwall for some reason. 




 Love me some Maiden. 




 That song does still rock. My favorite Anthrax song is [Fueled.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMzWeV4Xf9A) 




 Hah! I received the Grease soundtrack for Christmas when I was 8 too, I believe. Sandy was hot in those black pants... 




 I loved the ladies in their videos... 




 Sweet! 




 What's the worst that I can say? 




 You chose...correctly. 




 I remember one year, my mom took me school shopping... 




 Smart move! My parents subjected me to the horrors of the remake of Sergeant Pepper by the Bee Gees. Agh! The Beatles version is the ONLY version.  




 I had Pyromania first, but Hysteria was a good one, too! 




 And you still rock it, right? 




 You and 17 million others bought that. It was way more than a feeling! 




 Thanks! 




 "Keep on Loving You" - first song I slow danced with a girl to. 




 I am off to listen to Big Pig. 




 Smash is good. I hope you discovered NOFX after you got into punk rock. 




 That's my mop bucket! 




 Heh. I hear you on the Poison thing. 




 Can't go wrong with that one. 




 Rebel. 




 It's good to respect various genres! 




 THIS is a great story. Thank you, you wild and crazy guy. 




 Damn I hated when my Walkman got hungry. 




 Nice. Good choice. 




 Great first buy for sure. 




 Never heard of them. Interesting sound, I must admit!

EDIT: How the hell have I never heard them? I love it. 




 Hold me now...

 




 Noooooo! They're all gonna laugh at you! 




 Just the word "Free Willy" always bring a smile to my face. 




 As you should. 




 I still have "For those about to rock" lying around on cassette somewhere. 




 That's awesome. Pretty much the only tape in the deck my entire Junior year in high school. 









 Sleeping with the CEO. 




 Heh heh heh... 




 Oh hell yes. 




 Proudly! 




 Love this one. Only song I skip is "Off his head." 




 Nice! I was 11 when Dirty Deeds came out. I am old. 




 Buy it now! 




 Nice alliteration. 




 I love that one. 




 First one I haven't heard of yet! 




 That is a classic! 




 Good one! 




 Awesome! 




 Excellent first purchase! 




 That's solid. 




 Mine was AC/DC - Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. I still listen to it, it holds up.
 









 WTF was that giant military truck doing over on the other side of the bushes? 




 I never really noticed this until now. I'll never be able to unsee it! 




 Boooo... 









 YOU chill out!

Edit: sorry, I'm on the rag. 




 No. I've been struck down, dammit. 




 Probably not going to get the answer you want here... 




 My fridge is so cold it froze a few of my beers. 




 Yup. But damn I am hungry. 




 Pee on it. 




 She weighs 550 pounds. 




 Getting my teeth scraped at the dentist. 




 But how else are you going to hit the brown note? 




 Did I say it was a bad idea? 




 Vuvuzela. 




 Helium 




 Bout tree-fiddy. 




 It took me three days to finish mine! 




 Because it tastes like motherfucking chicken of the gods. 




 You guys make some huge fucking plates of food. I had a burrito there once that was bigger than my pillow. 




 Mmmkay 




 Red Lobster for the plastic lover in you! 




 Church of the Holy Potato 




 That's how Dexter did it. 




 I'm dead,hit in the head ten times by a Fender strat. 




 It was my lame attempt at referencing your user name.

;) 




 Are you trying to start a...flame war? 




 Yup. The tow hook is an option. 




 Freakin' beautiful. 




 Nailed it! 




 Where you at, OP? 




 Jesus Christ, that looks frightening. Glad you two weren't more seriously hurt. Automotive safety has come a long way!

Did the other car stop, or did they not even know what they'd done? 




 Your Mom.
