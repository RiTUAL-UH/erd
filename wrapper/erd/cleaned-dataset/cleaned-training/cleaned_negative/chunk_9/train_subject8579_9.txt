 I'd say that I'm more of a Dean Koontz kind of guy, but I have read a lot of King, and he is a member of the fellowship. 




 I've never heard it said that way. One alcoholic death, however, can have a profound effect on many others. Truly "dying of alcoholism" - not including accidents - is gruesome. Unfortunately, I think that a common number bantered around right now is that 1 out of every 24 alcoholics ever makes it to the rooms. Of those, I'd guess that 1 in 10 is serious enough to survive. Most of the people I see in the rooms are only there to get their court papers signed to stay out of jail. 




 You can check out some of my short stories on http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Creepypasta_Wiki or http://www.inkitt.com/  Some are a bit farfetched and not as close to reality, though.
