 All mice, as with humans, are susceptible to cancer to some extent....and I guess some research suggests mice are generally more "susceptible" than humans to some types of tumors. The cool thing with the mice is that you can use targeted genetic mutations to make the mice far more susceptible to certain types of cancers, and then look at the effect of stimuli on that rate of tumor development. That's what the researchers did here: they took a strain of mouse known to develop a certain (mammary, in this case) type of tumor, and had a control group and a group exposed to a disruption of day/night cycle. Then they compared the two.
Whether or not the mice develop tumors faster/more often than humans isn't so important...at least, not to this study. That's the beauty of the mouse studies -- taking genetically-identical mice and subjecting them to different conditions. I know it might not ultimately apply to humans, but it's a start.  




 That's an interesting premise I'd not considered...would the high HR and the resultant increase in blood flow be to defend against the rapid heat loss, or a result of compensation for the more rapid heat loss? 




 Some yes, some no. In this case the venom breaks up clots, not causes clots. The title is wrong. 




 They seem to make the implication that this new anti-thrombotic has a reduced risk of bleeding -- without testing that at all. If you can't clot, you're going to bleed...right? So that danger is still present. 

To me, the novelty here is the ability to produce heterodimeric proteins in yeast in a balanced way; this opens up a LOT of novel methodologies for investigating new therapeutic agents that act as heterodimers instead of monomers or homodimers...and also as a screening tool to find small molecules that can interfere with heterodimerization in a now-measurable (and better controlled) way.  I find THAT part of the study extremely interesting and promising.
