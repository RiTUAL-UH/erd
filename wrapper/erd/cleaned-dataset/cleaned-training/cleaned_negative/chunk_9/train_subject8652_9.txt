 Yeah, and I never posted why I quit /r/Technology or publicly took credit for it and revel in the fact that the automod rule set I created there is (1) still mostly used by /r/Technology right this second and (2) it spread to more than half the current default subreddits.  Oh, wait..... I did publicly post all that info and revel in taking credit for it.  

Considering I take credit for all this stuff, cause I like my badges of honor..... you're problem isn't that I did something bad.  It's that I did something good.  That others are seeing how my previous mod work was very good and are using it as the basis to stop you and your little nazi-wanna-be friends.  

You calling me pathetic is such fun.   Because it's truly meaningless coming from you.   [Goodnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2dnfAJlUwo).   




 If your subreddit has to actually publicly post the "No Murder allowed" rule, you probably have a bit of quality control problem on your hands.   




 You are going to find this oddly fascinating.    Earlier tonight we had a user in mod mail explain that he was a Nazi, and not a NeoNazi.   As if there was some hair spiting difference I cared about in relation to that.  I guess the extremely violent (wanna-be, we hope) right wing cares about minor distinctions of that nature though.   




 And I'm sure it's a big coincidence that the hate-mongers who aren't regularly users of /r/Documentaries all found their way to that thread all at the same time too.   That isn't suspicious at all.   

Oy vey.   




 The mods of /r/Europe are still modding the same way.   Heck, they are probably now even stricter than I ever was.    But then, I think the mods of /r/Europe are doing a fine job.    




 The /r/European user-base is all Stormfront wanna-bes and related idiots.   A good number of them took issue with [my comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5qt8e?context=3) when Spez did his AMA.  All while they were unwittingly [Proving my point](https://np.reddit.com/r/european/duplicates/3d4tnh/infamous_power_mod_utrain_subject8652_linked_to/) with their every objection.  




 The mods are removing stuff there because those people are trying to turn their subreddit into /r/conspiracy, complete with a lot of Antisemitic comments and other crud.   The mods are doing a good job cleaning it up with locking the comment-thread.  

Meanwhile, users from other subreddits are witch hunting the mod team there.   [Undelete](https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/3dsi69/massive_censorship_happening_within/), [Conspiracy-1](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dskoq/the_mysterious_case_of_deleted/), [Conspiracy-2](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dsq68/uss_liberty_documentary_reaches_front_page_with/), [Conspiracy-3](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dsmjd/watch_live_as_all_the_comments_on_a_rdocumentary/), [Conspiracy-4](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dt2kb/israeli_murders_rdocumentariescomments3dqwsathe/), etc.  

Calling them complete lunatics would be putting it lightly.   



















 Are you sure Fox News isn't in the service of Mephistopheles?   




 Only seven of them?    You need to follow all the religions, including the ones that contradict each other, and especially the ones that contradict themselves.   









 We got a note from a user and I looked at this and removed it now.  

In then future, when you have a concern that something that might not be an appropriate submission, please message the mod team and we'll look at it as soon as we see the mod mail. 

Thank you.  














 Excuse me, but I was under the impression that Tortoises were actually in control of levels 328, 418, 428, and 665.

 If we are lucky, the press will force him to change his mind.   




 I did ready my comment ahead of time.  But it was based on four or five comments I had written over the last couple of weeks.   I just edited them all into one comment.  Mostly because I knew there would be tons of comments in the thread.   And now after about an hour it's gotten over 8500 comments.   It's on it's way to 40K or 50K+ comments in there probably. 

I assume several other people did the same thing.   




 The comment was at about +120 then they linked to it.   I'm sure they will be by to tell us how they aren't a brigade at all.  




 Don't bullshit me.    The *ethics in journalism* line is total fucking bullshit of the highest order.   It's a lie you guy's KNOW is a lie but say it anyway.   That subreddit lacks all ethics.  

What is /r/KotakuInAction about:

See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3d2hv31/kn0thing_says_he_was_responsible_for_the_change/ct1qs7n) by /u/str1cken.  It will tell you want that subreddit is about.    I'll cut and paste the comment here.  

 gt;I haven't seen any personally "nasty stuff" about Pao

 gt;Nothing based upon her Gender or Ethnicity/Race.

Hey there!

I was curious about this myself, so I did a little bit of research.

Right now 16 of the top 20 posts *of all time* in KiA are about Ellen Pao directly (the post includes her name in the title) or indirectly (either about policies she has made or holding her responsible for things happening on reddit).

Weird, right? This sub is 10 months old but 80% of the top-upvoted posts in the subreddit are about Ellen Pao. Huh.

I know, I know : It's actually about ethics in games journalism.

Here are some choice net-positive-vote-total comments from just the top 5 Pao-related posts on KiA:

"[Arrogant bitch defines Ellen Pao quite well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c2e68/ellen_pao_to_nyt_the_most_virulent_detractors_on/csrq9ha)" [+222]

So let's put that one to bed : Plenty of KiA users have said and upvoted "nasty stuff" about /u/ekjp and there's definitely more than "nothing based upon her Gender or Ethnicity/Race." 




 The best run subreddit communities are the ones that have mod-teams that enforce the rules and don't allow any hate-speech and other bullshit.  

For example, /r/Science does not allow bullshit opinions that aren't scientifically valid.    Either as submissions or comments.    So, they will ban you for creationism, anti-vaccine BS and [climate change denial](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) as these are all views that are backed by all the world scientific community.    In short, they want everyone to know that /r/Science is scientifically accurate.  The same goes for other science based communties on Reddit such as /r/AskScience and /r/Biology.  

Likewise, /r/History and other history-based subredits like /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory don't allow history-denial.   So, things like Holocaust denial, Lost Cause of the Confederacy propaganda,  Ancient Aliens crap, Neo Nazis, White Supremacy and other total bullshit views will get you banned.  

There is a large problem with hate-based groups that are trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit in their attempt to spread their views.  Hate based groups like: White Supremacists, Neo Nazis, Skinheads, Holocaust Deniers, Extreme Misogynists, Homophobes, Racists who view all Muslims as terrorists, Extreme Racists, etc.   It's a large number of groups, and there is a massive amount of overlap between these subgroups.  

These radical nuts run subreddits like: /r/CoonTown, r/GreatApes, /r/European,  /r/Holocaust (holocaust deniers), /r/TheRedPill, /r/KotakuInAction, etc. 

Right now, [/r/CoonTown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

If they don't take care of it, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more [media outlets](http://gawker.com/so-long-reddit-1717315112) will start pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.    

Another point that largely gets  ignored in this debate:  Non-racists generally don't want to hang out with racists.   Racist and hate-group users generally strive to drive out the non-racist users.    

Everybody has a story about the racist family member that they only see once a year at some family gathering,  and we all dread running into that family member.   We really don't want to hang out, even for a short amount of time, with that person.   Well, when it comes to family we make sacrifices, so we (1) try and only talk about the weather or sports with them and (2) are very thankful it's for only one-hour a year.     But when it comes to non-family, you don't make the same allowances.    We just cut those people out of our lives.   

Bad users will drive out good users.  And then more bad users will be attracted to this site.  And it will become a bad-user reinforcement-cycle with more and more bad users driving out, they hope, all the good users.    These groups even know this, and count on the non-racists leaving.  It's why they use terms like *Colonizing*, as they are actively attempted to take the entire site over.  That is their goal.   They are not interested in undirected discussion with anyone.  They want to control the narrative and how any discussion happens.  They are actively trying to turn young people who aren't already racist bigots into more racist bigots.     If you allow them to run wild, 90% of the good users will leave.  And what's left will simply be a Storm Front members wet dream.    

Paul Graham mentions this issue with bad users in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html).

Other web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups. It's high time that Reddit did the same. 

I also want to address the BS that some limits on free speech are inherently bad.   Because the only country that really thinks free speech means "Anything Goes, including extreme bigotry" is the United States.     But other nations, such as Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Italy, etc.  place some limits on "Free Speech" via bans on things like Holocaust denial.    Now..... I'm sorry, but you can't tell me Germany or Canada is any less free than the United States.    The reason the Germans don't allow open-Nazis into the political debate in their country is that they tried it once.   It ended badly. 

In short, you don't allow these people a foot hold because their goal is to make Reddit into a hate-propaganda site.   Hopefully the admins are finally going to do something about these groups.   It's high time the admins took action.

 FPH was never a top-20 subreddit.  It had about 150K subscribers.   That would, rounding up a bit to assume it had nearly 160K, had made it the 220th largest subreddit.

 /u/Blackstar9000, good to hear from you again.  And good to hear that you generally agree with me.  I didn't see this thread until just now.   Next time maybe shoot me a PM please.  

I see most of the other points I would have made in response to you already made by some others in this thread, so I won't bother repeating them.   

But I do want to reiterate one point that I think was large ignored.   Non-racists generally don't want to hang out with racists.   Racist users generally drive out non-racist users.

 Excuse me, but "open and honest discussion" never includes calls for mass genocide.    And anyone who thinks it would doesn't understand what any of those words mean.  Period.

/u/Spez's post here gives me hope that, at long last,  the admins are finally going to do something about these groups.   It's high time the admins took action.  




 Okay.  




 Yes, and it's a poorly managed bizzaro land at that.   

Daeres is a very good moderator.  He's not some kind of crazy guy who sends in 5000 tanks to crush the bones of his enemies beneath them, like georgy_k_zhukov.   He's more interested in utilizing highly controlled air power to bomb out a city center and then secretly poisoning the local water supply.   And that is when he releases the genetically modified killer hamsters with lasers on their heads into the ecosystem.    

From a mod perspective, it's never a simple banning.  It really can be a thing of pure beauty. 







































 I would see anti-brigading measures as something important to moderators.    I'm pretty sure that I am not the only one.    I am not sure if it's priority #1, but it's certainly important.  




 [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgzbvef?context=3).  Good night, Alice.  




 I'm sorry, but equating /r/Atheism with people calling for mass genocide of X-ethnic group.  

Holocaust deniers are not part of any "bastion of intellectualism".  

You are purposely being colossally intellectual dishonest and undeserving of any more response.

Full stop.   









 /r/Technology was removed as a default by the admins after I resigned in a very public way from the mod team.   It was the lack of actions by the mods who refused to improve the subreddit that caused the admins to remove it as a default subreddit.   [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgz8ecm?context=3) for info on what happened. 

As to the Automod config that I helped author at /r/Technology, it has ended up being used at more than half the current default subreddits.   You act like that is some kind of shame for me, but get this: **I'm proud of that fact**. It was and still is a great configuration. Heck, /r/Technology is still using the majority of it right this second. 

The other mods there with me, /u/Agentlame, /u/Skuld, TheSkyNet, etc. all of us resigned in protest at the inactivity of our then fellow moderators.   Fellow mods who refused to discuss anything at all about how the subreddit should function.    Of course, we were of the opinion that a subreddit called /r/Technology should actually be focused on technology, not ancillary topics like business, marketing, politics or simple news.    Stock price fluctuations are not about technology.   A simple car fire is not a r/Technology story.    News stories have a large subreddit called /r/News that exists for them.   And political stories have a large subreddit called /r/Politics for them. 

My degrees are in computer science.  Software and hardware are technology.   Stock price is not.   An article about how a new type of electric car works is technology, where as an article about the current stock price of the electric car company is not.    

Heck, the haters figured out we were doing the right thing after we resigned.  That was why lots of people demanded the resignation of the old do-nothing mods and many of the new mods after we left.  

 




 Web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups.   It's time for Reddit to do the same.  

When a site allows racists to run wild, good users will leave because they will not wish to associate with racists.   In effect, bad users will drive out the good users.  Those users who leave are replaced by more bad users who are attracted by the permissive attitude.   By allowing racists free reign, they will proliferate and become an even larger problem.   

Paul Graham mentions this issue with bad users in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html). 




 There are many things were there are NOT two sides to the issue.   There is just the correct view, and the wrong view.    For example, evolution does not have two sides to the debate.  Instead what you have people who believe in science and complete and utter morons.  The anti-science idiots have no right to their opinion.   Period.  

This is true of several issues.   Evolution is is real.   Climate Change is real.  The Holocaust happened.  The US Civil War was about Slavery.   Anti-vaccine hysteria is bullshit.     

/r/Science does not allow comments from people who don't believe in evolution, spread anti-vaccine propaganda, or deny climate science.   The same goes for other science based subreddits such as /r/askscience and /r/Biology.    

[An article](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) written by /u/Nallen on why /r/Science does not allow Climate Change deniers. 

Likewise, /r/History and it's fellow history-based subreddits such as /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory do not allow Holocaut Denial, Ancient Aliens BS, Lost Cause of the Confederacy crap, Neo Nazi propaganda, and other forms of history denial. 

And I'm sorry, but these are not topics that the mod-teams of these subreddits are going to open up for debate.  Because there is no debate about them by anyone except hate-based groups who are knowingly pushing hate-based agendas.    If you do not like these mod-policies, then you are free to unsubscribe from our subreddits immediately.  




 [I'm familiar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/3c8cdm/the_rmodtalk_clique_is_not_allowing_new_mods_to/cstaed0?context=3) with their partial brand of idiocy.   There are many of those types of subreddits.  I was not attempting to create an all-included-comprehensive list.  




 I have been very disappointed in the reddit community for a while now.   There were often submissions to backwater hate-based subreddits about Ellen Pao that had comment chains which were all comments about her sex and race.  This was well before the blow ups with the mods.  Nominally the news story submissions were about her law suit with her former employer, but they were all nothing more than excuses for idiots to gather round an make  sexist and racist comments.  

Subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/SubredditCancer, /r/Undelete, /r/KotakuInAction, /r/Redpill, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/GreatApes, etc. all made common-cause in the effort to say nasty stuff about Pao.  Then when the ruling about FPH was handed down, they made sure to invite all those hate-based users into their idiot-clubhouses.  

When the mods of the defaults acted, independent of of any of that crap, those idiots pored out of the word work again.    Mod teams wanted to make sure that our users and the press knew that we didn't care about Ellen Pao's lawsuit or be thought to be in common cause with a bunch of hate-based idiots.  At /r/History we threw together a [wiki-page to explain our reasons for going dark](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/timer).    

Now something that needs to be addressed very quickly are the various hate-based groups which are actively attempting to *colonize* (their word) parts of reddit.   Several hate based groups of white supremacist, neo nazis, holocaust deniers, etc. are setting up shop around Reddit.  
 
Right now, [/r/coontown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

As such, the admins need to directly address the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/Holocaust and other subreddits that solely exist as propaganda outlets for pure hate.     If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more media outlets will pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it. 

I've been saying this [since before](https://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk/comments/3c7pj1/rmodtalk_seems_like_a_very_levelheaded_community/cstg9jt?context=3) Ellen Pao resigned.   I'm saying it now.  I will continue to say it in the future.  
 









 I'm surprised this story doesn't claim he killed them all and was instead about whether he was legally entitled  to keep the dead bodies.   




 Do you think Trump could type more than 140 characters?   




 A simple alternative might be some kind of thread-trigger (similar to when a mod flags a thread as nsfw), that automatically causes a stanza that locks the thread to be added to the subreddits Automod config.   Then it could be a simple extension of how automod already functions.   But without the mod needing to know how to code it directly or edit Automod config.   




 Just going to leave [this here](https://xkcd.com/1357/).  




 Web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups.   It's time for Reddit to do the same.  

When a site allows racists to run wild, good users will leave because they will not wish to associate with racists.   In effect, bad users will drive out the good users.  Those users who leave are replaced by more bad users who are attracted by the permissive attitude.   By allowing racists free reign, they will proliferate and become an even larger problem.   

Paul Graham mentions this issue with bad users in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html). 




 It's one thing to see a good and bad side to various issues, but there are some things are primarily one or the other.   And by vast orders of magnitude.   For example,  white supremacist hate groups are bad.   I think we can credibly say that without worrying about extraneous factors.   

The same goes for similar groups that espouse holocaust denial, proponents in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Lost Cause of the Confederacy crazies, believers that all-Muslims are terrorists, etc.   One also finds that these other fringe groups all have more than a small amount of overlap with the white supremacist racist groups.   So much so that I think we can begin to speak of them as one large hate-feast.

 /u/Maxion and /u/dzneill used to be good at that too.   /u/Il_Shades, for about two weeks until Anu and Max drove him to quit cause he dared to think that the rues applied to everyone.     














 My second link explores our arguments with him about that.  /u/Rolmos and /u/Creesch are in that thread showing the screenshots of do-nothing Qgyh2 from the modlog.   




 The automod configuration wiki page from /r/Technology ended up being used by more than half the current defaults.   Right this minute.    You act like that is some kind of shame for me, but get this:   I'm proud of that fact.   It was and still is a great configuration.    Heck, /r/Technology is still using the VAST majority of it right now.    

Go sell crazy somebody place.  We aren't buying it here.   




 You saw who the applictions were from and HOW they were collected.   And you know I was not the one who was adding anyone as a moderator. /u/TheSkyNet, /u/Agentlame, /u/Skuld, etc. were the ones inviting the new moderators after they were voted on in the backroom.   But then, you just don't care what the facts were, then or now.   




 Except the fact that Qgyh2 wouldn't let /r/Technology recruit new mods to join the team, and when we decided that we had to do it because we desperately needed more hands to help run the subreddit..... well, that blew up big time.   [See here](https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgz8ecm?context=3).  

Also, he's famous for doing nothing.  [See here](https://np.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1pkb2b/sorry_reddit/). 




 You sound like the kind of guy maybe I should try and recruit to mod /r/Food.   









 I didn't remove those for personal grudge.  I removed them because those idiots were using /r/Ideasfortheadmins for their personal grudges.   And I would remove it again today for the same reason.  

You want to believe BS, you can believe it all you want.  But it's still BS.

If people want message mod teams, there is a link of the sidebar of every subreddit that does just that.   It's very easy for them to use it.   But they always want to act like it's something only rocket scientists can figure out.   



















 He was fried.  Let him stay fried.   




 It's not just /r/AskHistorians, but a whole bunch of subreddits, from /r/History, /r/science, /r/askscience, /r/Biology, /r/BadHistory, /r/HistoryPorn,  and even none history or science topic subreddits.   Places like /r/Politics, /r/Bestof, /r/GetMotivated, /r/Apple, /r/AskReddit, /r/IAMA, /r/todayilearned, etc.  All have varying rule-sets they use for comments and submissions.   Some remove not much more than the rules of Reddit require, but all will remove a bit more than the admins require.   Even if it's just blatant mass-postings of profanity  (Things like the word "FUCK" repeated hundreds of times), to racism, trolling, etc.  

Mod teams get to define these rules.   If users don't like it, they can discuss it with the mods or use another subreddit.  There are thousands of subreddits out there.   But /r/History is never going to allow Holocaust denial.      And while Spez has now said the didn't mean to effect this, some undesirable users are going to point to his comment to play bullshit rules lawyer games.   




 Just going to cut and paste what I just posted in /r/Modtalk. 

---  

/r/History removes hundreds, if not thousands, of comments on a daily basis.  This is true for several subreddits.  We also ban people a lot for breaking our rules against history-denial.   Holocaust denial is just the #1 form of history-denial.   There are several other types.  

/r/AskHistorians is the same way.   Same with /r/HistoryPorn, /r/BadHistory and several other subreddits.  

/r/Science bans science-denial, be it climate change denial, creationists, anti vaxxers, etc.   Same with lots of other science-based subreddits. 

The mods of these subreddits use all the tools at our disposal to deal with these idiots.  Regular bans, Automod-bans, automod rule sets for both comments and submissions, and we even have more specific bots that enforce rules where automod can't.   And we still have a lot of mod-work that needs to be done to keep our subreddits properly clean and curated. 

If /u/Spez thinks moderators are going to have to tolerate these assholes ruining our subreddits, and their agenda-pushing political bullshit, then he should just cut to the quick and resign as CEO right now.

I will say that Spez is now trying to engage with moderators, but it's just beginning.   









 One thing that I think the admins are going to need to directly address is the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/Holocaust and others there exist solely to spread hate.   

Right now, [/r/coontown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).

This info was brought to my attention by /u/PraiseBeToScience in another discussion.   I didn't know the problem was that extreme already.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit. Or any other corporation for that matter.   This is something that they need to address.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully the media pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.  









 What was it - more than Four years ago?   This place exploded into a bunch of shit.   I'm still not exactly sure what happened then and I was there for it.  









 This place has been quiet for a while.   














 Well, having the Spez back makes up for a long of things that have been happening.  Welcome home.

 The Confederate Constitution forbade states from ever amending their constitution from interfering with the institution of slavery.  The Confederate Constitution made slavery a forever pact that could never be removed.   They loved states rights so much that at the beginning of their attempt-a-country they limited the power of states rights.  

I'm sorry, but there were no other real issues involved in the American Civil War.  All the other ancillary issues are the slavery question in disguise.    


 




 The reason Lincoln eventually became anti-Slavery late in the war is that he realize it was the root cause of the Civil War.    The country couldn't exist with it and not fight Civil Wars.  If you ban it, then you get rid of the root problem of the war.   

The Confederacies own leaders said they were fighting the war for slavery.   The Cornerstone Speech by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens explains point black the the Southern States were attempting to found a new nation based on ""upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition".  

So Lincoln decided that to win the war for real, Slavery had to be eliminated.   After the war, the former Southern leaders took to rewriting their own history to say that they were fighting for other things.   Normally bringing up States Rights, but also talking about the Southern Agrarian Economy, Tax issues, Tariff policies,  etc.   But each of those alternate explanations for the war are all really just the slavery question in disguise.  

Southern Economy was based on slavery. 

Tax issues, around profits made from goods produced by slavery. 

Tariffs on products again produced by slavery. 

States rights, to own people as farm animals.  

Slavery is the core issue the war was about.    Every other issue involved in the war was, at it's heart, also the slavery issue.  

After the war, Confederate General James Longstreet was asked what the Civil War was fought over.  His response was simple:  "If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".   He knew what his war was about.  Saying it was about anything else is outright lying.  

Frederick Douglass became one of the people who helped turn Lincoln into the *Great Emancipator* after his death.    Douglass understood that Lincoln had figured out that the root cause of the war was slavery and that he then fought to destroy the very institution that caused the war.   




 Sadly, they think laws against murder are also being required to do something. Well, not do something, but laws against murder clearly limit their liberty to murder people.   And once you have placed limits on murder, then it's just a slippery slope to real crimes, like lying to an insurance agent.
