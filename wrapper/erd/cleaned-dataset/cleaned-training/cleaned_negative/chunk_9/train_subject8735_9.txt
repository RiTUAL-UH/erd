 TNTD so good  




 I feel so bad for this guy.  




 Just wondering if people think it could/will.  




 What would you do, where would you go to survive a zombie apocalypse?  




 I agree, he's the greatest, I mean Titanic and Avatar were everything.  




 It's because he has a good personality on set, that's the only reason he's taking over all these blockbusters.  




 Titanic is my favorite movie.  




 Bug (2006) 




 Warcraft 




 I know Whiplash and John Wick are two of them. What are some others?  




 Mine began with Armageddon, Titanic, Pearl Harbor, The Lost World: Jurassic Park in 96/97/98.  




 In, The Village, when Bryce Dallas Howard is running through the house to get away from the monsters and the music is going, it's so beautiful.  




 Warcraft 




 Tron 3 




 Jurassic Park had better graphics than Jurassic World.  




 I saw a movie Extinction came out in 2014. I know Disney's Dinosaur was good...is Extinction good or any others?  




 The theme for Titanic was popular.  




 The scene where Arwen is slowly dying and Elrons like "your hands are cold."  




 Titanic 




 I agree with you ... JP, TLW, JW, JP3 




 When Chris Pratt had to stop her from screaming for those kids...homage to JP. 




 I just don't see the flaws and am wondering what they are.  




 When the raptors take the side of the Indominus Rex...what!?! Major twist  




 That old girl T-Rex man she stole the show...was a little disappointed we didn't get more of her but what a twist there at the end. 

The face off at the end was everything we could have hoped for, the raptors were awesome. 

Now what? Sequel? :) I hope so.  




 James Cameron  




 I enjoyed the 2nd and 3rd too. :)  




 He/she will I think
