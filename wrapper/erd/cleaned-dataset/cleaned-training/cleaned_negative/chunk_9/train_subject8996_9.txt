 two rounds to **love**? what sport is this?  




 not a big bone 




 why does his fedor impression sound like his andrei impression? 

fedor is soft spoken, a very easy impression to do, so why does he sound nothing like fedor? **worst fedor impression ever** 




 she dominated every single fight 

who else was close to that?  




 LAM 




 she couldn't finish that choke https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKUnr3y9lZo 




 not in it for karma lol, i only posted it because it was better quality 














 Just think, for each person who has been caught, there have been many numerous people who have used and not been caught.  




 Solid point. The media is already starting on Bernie. However, we have more of a voice as citizens today than did people back then. We can set talking points and decide what is important.  









 Will South Park create any presidential politics episodes? There will likely be some good material once things start getting heated. 














 when you have no girls texting you #lincolnchafee

when you get no call backs for job interviews #lincolnchafee 



















 Bernie has maintained a consistent position being against big money. He can ask the person to stop and say he doesn't support it, but in the end under the law the person can continue. 









 They almost certainly do coordinate but just not enough to be called out on it. But even when they do, nobody polices it. I think the Sanders campaign would be the only one who doesn't directly coordinate. **Usually the PACs are run by the candidates lawyers or staff members. This person is not affiliated with Sanders. Big distinction.** 




 Are there any other people big in music, tv/movies, sports, etc who would want to continue this trend of endorsing Sanders?  




 It wouldn't be donated. They'd be voicing their views with their money. 




 It was only a matter of time until one formed. But the name of the PAC is pretty hilarious I will concede. 




 Demand? This is America. Money talks and people can spend it how they want.  




 There are actually a few billionaires out there who think they have enough and want everyone else to have. I know it sounds like a unicorn, but there are a few of them out there.  




 Some people like to disparage Lil B but  he's a generational leader.  




 exactly 




 It's not Sanders' doing. People will spend how they please in this system. 


































 4,000

he's a bigger liar about crowds than he is his hair 




 30k? that is impressive! 




 what is the maximum occupancy of hall 4? 




 all my mexican friends who are going are american citizens 

the large majority of latinos in metropolitan phoenix are legal  




 I have multiple mexican-american friends going. I think we may get a pleasant surprise to the diverse makeup of  this upcoming crowd. 




 I can't wait to go! I am hoping we crush the current record for presidential crowds.  




 it said .8? then it f*cked up, it's .08 




 .8? lol

you'd likely die at half that

legal limit is .08 bruh, not 0.8 




 give peace a chance  









 A fight against Mark Hunt would make sense! Mark has better ground defense now. Let's see that rematch. Better than some third tier fighter in M1. 



















 [Hayabusa](http://www.hayabusafight.com/ca-en/products/performance-apparel/fight-shorts/) is so much better looking that Reebok. It will be sad to see Georges downgrade if he comes back. I will never purchase anything made by Reebok unless they start making good products. The UFC "kits" are hideous.  






















































 Real fans can be honest. He's eating up a lot of the cap for little production.  




 should have recorded it, smh sorry man

ufc product is  









 what? larry has been done for years now and is our 3rd best WR on the team

even his discounted rate is robbery  




 He plays the 5. 




 I was disappointed in the Suns picking him. Then I watched Amare in the summer league and was blow away and couldn't wait for him to crush the big boys. 




 you can't trust a man who lies about his hair  




 Just look at the cities who have increased it in the last couple of years. Their unemployment has gone down.  









 I assume he has his flights, hotels, food, nose candy, and other perks covered by the UFC?  




 Conor said he was making more than the gate. The gate was 7.1 million. 




 I'm not sure if it's a wig made from his own hair or the world's most elaborate comb over.  




 Dear sir or madam, in reality increasing a minimum wage [creates more jobs](http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com/pages/job-loss). The lowest earners spend their money unlike the wealthy. When they spend their money this creates more economic growth and more jobs. The economic data is out there and it concludes increases in minimum wages increase the number of jobs in the free market. If we can supplement that with additional government created employment, it would create even more jobs and give us a strong economy.  














 People are naive and vote for the wrong reasons. 

The right reason: voting for your own economic interest and for the greater good. 














 i hear that 














 Bernie Sanders represents me as a Democrat more than anyone else in the Democratic Party. He is the ideal Democrat. He's what every "one of you" should be. He's hope to restore the American Dream. 




 1st round Lakers in 4 

2nd round Warriors in 4 

3rd round Spurs in 4

finals Knicks in 7  




 It depends on your specific anatomy and what kind of damage you are taking and for how long. If you're not going to become a millionaire from fighting, you're better off never taking shots to the head.  




 I was going to make an office joke, but that's so sad! so young
 




 shorts are unbearably ugly  




 they brought that shit on themsevles, especially KD  




 Rogan does what he wants more or less. 




 thank you good sir 




 any chance u could post a picture of this sequence? 




 you're all out of touch with hiphop culture but it's ok 

basedgod is a merciful god 




 conor sounds like he's trying not to die  




 [sounds right](http://cdn-www.i-am-bored.com/media/thumbnails/captain-obvious-thanks.jpg) 




 [Uno cards](http://c2.q-assets.com/images/products/p/qj/qj-115_2z.jpg) 




 He's not opposed to gun control lol 




 Conor won't lose. Don't need to read anything past the first five words of this post.  




 she's done steroids for more years than chyna did them 




 career steroid abuse has really done a number on her voice, face, and body 

she looks like the quintessential example of female steroids use 




 why wouldn't one of them take him out?  




 The Floyd Mayweather strategy.  









 i had to mute, it's just that bad 




 he's fighting the system that everyone else has embraced, so yeah 




 anyone else annoyed by that woman's voice? she won't stop talking 









 are you frank trigg or travis browne? 




 Good point, but I meant Ronda.  














 never enough, much more conor material needed to reach ideal saturation levels 




 Brett Favre.  




 Yeah, I guess she's comfortable crushing those cans. 




 [Chris Broussard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ5Yy71gP1c) is a bigot. 

Not saying Mark should say this. I'm just saying. 




 Mark is worth 3 billion. ESPN is worth 50 billion. Maybe if he invests in something big on shark tank... 




 i doubt that 




 I'd love to see side by side video of young dirk and porzingis. 




 Hate ISIS more.  




 impossible 

even if Aldo was fighting

conor is last 




 there really need to be more conor gifs 




 is this a serious question? this is the Conor show

 




 she definitely needs money

that's why she's fighting

georges doesn't need money 




 but ronda stands to make triple what she normally makes in a fight by fighting her 









 test cut it 




 [check this out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_professional_sports_leagues_by_revenue) 




 I have nothing against hockey. I respect it very much. They are extremely tough. All I'm saying is the sky is blue.  




 Why not? It's called not eating. She will have to lose lean body mass, but it can be done.  




 If Cyborg loses one of these fights it could mean the end of a very big pay day for Ronda Rousey. 

Rousey should take that fight ASAP while it still has big selling power. 




 More NHL for you. I didn't say it's not amazing. Don't be upset at me because hockey is a regional sport and that the NHL is a B tier league. I love track and field but I realize almost nobody really cares about it except for a month every four years.  




 so what happens next? how long before there are new districts that aren't fixed? 




 touche 




 [Arvydas Sabonis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW9q-0x2gu8), more that he came late to the show than bloomed late, but close enough. 




 new new new new world order 




 we don't want a bandwagoner like you  




 whatever he says clinton will say me too 




 you don't like the hair plugs? 




 meh 




 i'll give you 13
