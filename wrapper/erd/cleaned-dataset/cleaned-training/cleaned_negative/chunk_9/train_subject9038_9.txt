 Now that's a comment I like. It even better because it's from a girl's perspective. Great comment really.
I agree with everything. As I said I am willing to do the FWB thing, just didn't know what to do. And I was thinking about the cuddling thing. Damn that's my favorite thing :D Too bad
As Roosevelt's wife said: "Every day do something that frightens you" and since the FWB is something new to me I'm a bit scared really so that's why I am looking for comments like this one. Thanks :) 




 Well in my case we still chat, be friendly you know. She told me I can do everything just without the relationship and feelings. Personally I am not scared to commit. Maybe it's she who's scared. We are behaving like we are friends. But there will be benefits. Like in that movie. Even though life is never like that :D 




 If he didn't have those coins we wouldn't be able to see your hand right now. Science :D
