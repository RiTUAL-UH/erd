 Just a short video of a tornado in Port Talbot - Wales, Nothing spectacular but the only video of a tornado in this area i've ever seen. No amount of web searching came up with anything else! 









 When I saw him he was very jittery and seemed very stressed out and was on the phone to his publicist talking about a flight from Manchester airport the next day, wasn't till later on the next week I found out he was going to the jungle and why he seemed so worried haha. 









 Well thats the thing, i spoke to Danny in March and he denied anything, spoke to Robert in May he confirmed, spoke to Norman and Chris in October they both confirmed and finally spoke to Craig in November and he also confirmed. But when i spoke to Robert and queried why Danny said no, he stated that back then they weren't allowed to confirm but since then they have all been told they can say it's happening.

Spoke to all of them in one year, was pretty proud of that! 




 no probs velixie, love it 




 Last time i spoke to one was Craig Charles in Cardiff at the start of November and he confirmed for end of 2015 then.
