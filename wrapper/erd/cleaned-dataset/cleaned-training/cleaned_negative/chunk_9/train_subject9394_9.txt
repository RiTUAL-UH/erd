 Is that so? Then I was badly informed by my peers. Reminds me of a guy I know who flooded his apartment because he didn't know that he didn't know something significant in regards to water pressure on a higher floor. You don't ask if you don't assume that you lack knowledge. 




 Any more lurkers around? Let me tickle you to make an account after all: "GeorgeLurkas" 




 Too bad, the article doesn't say. I guess not. But marred, probably. 




 Yep. This is a glorious example. From the article:

 The court heard that the father was concerned that, once his daughter began showing an interest in boys, there was a risk she would have sex outside marriage, which he believed was a sin under Islamic law.

 He felt that a "solution" to this problem was for his daughter to get married so that she would not be living in sin if she had sex.

Islam - religion of "SUCK IT, FEMALES!!1"

...

Epic. (emphasis mine)

 Some months later, *against the strong objections from the girl's mother*, the father arranged for his daughter to marry the student in an Islamic ceremony at  his home in the Hunter region of NSW. 




 Yes, I'm just saying that this is not how people tick when they see bacon. 




 Context doesn't matter. Bacon is to be upvoted.

 Your comment I replied to was ambiguous. I read it to mean "This post here already has *a lot* of upvotes." 




 Alternative title: "OK, you got me. Now what." 




 Yet another example that *for me* at least shows how right it is that I never use anything but .nextLine() for System.in. I know that it's probably against the spirit of something in someplace, but I want to be in total control and don't want any surprises. .nextLine() gives me 100% predictable behavior - and you *do* have to press ENTER to input stuff on the console, anyway, so I don't see any considerable advantage for the other methods, they only get in the way. 




 It's probably quite tasty.

 [Super Motherload](http://store.steampowered.com/app/269110/) only requires arrow keys and the occasional other key. Even has local multiplayer, e.g. two people over keyboard (afair). 15 full price, but I got it on Steam Summer Sale, probably for 3.74

http://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/info?plain=supermotherload

It's one of the many 2D digger games. Well done. I always play it before work or when I get home, so when I have small time slices of about 10-30 minutes to fill. It has a bit of a story arc, kind of, and I'm looking forward to seeing where this is heading.

It's not great, it's rather a casual game, but it's also not bad at all. 




 That ... is great! It made me look up the entertaining German movie "Die Bluthochzeit", which I would directly translate as "the blood wedding".

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382572

But nope. They failed. The English title is: "The Wedding Party". There's no "Bloody Marriage" title on IMDB yet. Man, such an opportunity. 




 Sounds like a witch test. 




 Good karma, I guess. 




 Is that so? Because I just did that, kinda, while being German no less. In case some wasps are still asleep, let me add that I don't like Greece all that much.

 I also don't quite object to the highways (Autobahnen), built for getting shit from A to B during the war.

That's always what I pull out when I wonder if a negative event that taught or brought me something positive was actually negative. "Hitler. Autobahnen." Yes it was negative. The ability to make some positive out of it doesn't make it non-negative. 




 [Life Is Strange](http://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/), all episodes (Basically required.) were 16 during Summer Sale.

I can't remember having cared this much about characters in a game and about what they do. The gameplay is even decent. Can't wait for episode 4 5.

Really, if you dismiss this game, you should at least have taken a good look at it to be sure that you didn't make that decision lightly.

 Nit-pick: The black hole has little immediate impact on a galaxy's gravitational configuration. The high density of the stars at the center is what causes the attractive power of the center. 




  At least, according to our latest theories.

Hypotheses. Right? I mean, the things you're referring to would be reasonable falsifiable ideas based on one or more scientific theories. They'd require testing etc., until they eventually could become part of an already existing or of a new theory. Or are disproved. 




  Its like if you are at the gun range; you can improve your precision to a great amount, but if you're shooting at the wrong target, it wont help much. But you can definitely say that you are missing with great precision. 

That applies to *your* whole approach / world view. The irony is funny. 




  modern science does not contradict the makers word.

Incompatible with science: Resurrections, miracle healings (e.g. gluing the ear back on), miraculous food multiplications; and the Adam Eve story can't even be taken metaphorically, because the first homo sapiens (sapiens) didn't occur in a vacuum, they evolved like everything else. There's probably more, but I don't care enough about the Bible to know. 




 The fucking POPE accepts evolution. Not that he *should know* - but he would have some reason to say that it's not true. So, him accepting it says something about the massiveness of the scientific consensus. 




 Most characters are the same, but you get an interesting new perspective on at least two of them. You fight *for* Handsome Jack, so the things you see and hear of him are of different categories, and the Claptrap DLC is a whole campaign that takes place *inside* of Claptrap, which deals a lot with its past and psychology. The humor is alright, imho on the same level, but my memory isn't that clear. 




 No, but now I do. What's your point? 




 I have seen a few games that darken their borders and especially corners like this, and the feature is called "vignette" in the options, so I guess it's a known term at least among gamers.

 Rolling aircraft carrier. Nice. Haven't seen that yet in a movie. (Could use harrier "motor cycles" instead of drones. In the movie.) 




 For a proper terror attack, no bomb is required. You could just fly a drone over a tightly crowded place and spray sulfuric acid or something like that. Much more terror, much more suffering.

I always wondered why the oh so chemically inclined terror-Muslims (Like, the terror-version.) don't just damage and crash a tanker truck full of acid atop a small village. That has never happened before and would be remembered for a long ass time. Would also be rather easy to achieve. Such an act strikes me to be like 9/11: When you think about it, you wonder why nobody has done this before. Then someone does it, and it's like nobody was able to imagine the possibility for some reason.

 On second thought: What happens if you visit the link directly? Does the "hide" button say "unhide"? :) 




 Sorry, no. I know that my knowledge isn't solid, plus I know that opinions in the churches, denominations, etcwhatever, vary - you'll always step into the trap that you're not omniscient, that you don't know the whole world in this regard. But what you *can* know with almost objective certainty is *your doubts*. Nobody can enter that territory and tell you that they know better. 




 That can backfire. I don't think your atheism will fall, but your assumption that you can swat the guy might be very premature.

In any case, try not to get sucked into the labyrinth: Don't let an idiot pull you down to his level, then beat you with experience. Arguing Bible-details is like kicking water uphill, because the guy just has to make up an ad-hoc re-interpretation, which is what religious people like to do because they care about the holy truth of God so much (Sarcasm. That was sarcasm.), or the guy already has working interpretations, ultimately letting you look like you don't know what you're talking about.

The main guns are:

Lack of evidence. Competition-religions with same kind of evidence. In case he says "Ye, but same God!", mention alien abductions and contemporary miracle-performing saviors with tons of witnesses as additional examples.

Religion damages the mental health of society, and the good that is being done in the name or by religion (e.g. by the church) could be done secularly as well.

Morality can be derived properly from Evolution and from the base assumption that suffering is wrong. One could argue that it is not objective - but it's good enough. One can *certainly* argue that God-given morality is not objective at all, because the user can't know if it is from God or if they received it properly, which can e.g. be seen by some Christians accepting LGBT while others say it's a sin.

But don't think you're a Bible scholar. 




 It seems that you submit a lot of links like this to various subreddits. Some of those are about different games. I only checked two of those games, they are by the same studio: CYSCORPIONS

In case you are part of that studio, please do not make any post about those with titles that give the impression as if you're just *someone* who thinks that those games are worth a look. Because it would be a lie. Just *someone*'s opinion is based on their experience, while yours is composed a lot differently, this is why this information matters to readers, so please don't distort it. (And, I mean, you want potential success to be *real*, right. Not made-up.)

 You usually put variables and everything else in the most restrictive scope possible/reasonable. So, if you don't need the variables "outside" a method, put them inside.

And don't worry about variable declaration taking time: The JVM is very well optimized. Instance creation is a different story. But just *declaring* your variable e.g. during every single loop iteration doesn't cost you. 




 Yep, you can even just freely make a `{}` block out of thin air and it'll do that. (And I mean in a method. You could also make such a block on class level. That would be executed like a constructor, but before all other constructors, afaik. Similarly, you can make a `static {}` block on class level which will (afaik) be executed as soon as all class level variables have been assigned.)

 Security, though. I *heard* that it's a lot easier to get an unclean app on an Android phone than on an iPhone. (I never had a smartphone.)

Question: Colleague of mine keeps buying a new (used) iPhone and selling his current one, making a profit, and getting his data from one phone to the next / resetting a phone seems to be perfectly easy and uncomplicated. Does Android do that, too?

All that said/asked: I am quite the opposite of an Apple fan, but I don't ignore facts. 




 I, too, agree. Just don't forget to intently read negative reviews, too, even if you have to change the list selector for that.

They often contain facts that are good to know, e.g. "very repetitive boss fights", or technological facts that might be relevant. 




 I, too, have to object to give this more weight: These crap-"reviews", marked as "helpful" by 80% each, are *all* over the goddamn place. Everywhere.

 I am sure how to feel about this. Atheism is the saner choice, definitely if it's the "I don't know, but I also don't care." kind, and most definitely saner than Catholicism.

So, someone who is stuck in insanity reads your possibly sanity-inducing blog, but you don't read his God-fan-fiction blog. It's not the symmetry you make it out to be.

 Depends on the way the jaywalking takes place, and I have no idea how (or if at all) it took place here. When I do it, and I do it all the time, it's in a perfectly safe situation, and I mean even regarding "communication" (People seeing and deciding accordingly, e.g. approaching cars etc. - I don't do it when such an effect takes place in any way)

People who do what I do are on the safer side, anyway - because I check whether the situation is safe, no matter if the light is green or not. Reminds me of when I ran over a green pedestrian light in primary school and got run over by a motorcycle. 




 Well, if they would run away, they couldn't move their arms for efficient running, and they would have to get rid of the cuffs. E.g. their parents could see it and ask unpleasant questions.

I *think* that the cuffs are an efficient and harmless measure to prevent someone from actually running away. (Plus, think how dangerous a chase near traffic can easily become.)

 That might be surprisingly unpleasant, though. The pieces fit so neatly together, they might not have the wiggle room required to "fold", so they might mostly insist to stay one wall. Since the same applies to the outer-most places, the whole "door" might not move away at all, you might end up running against a wall whose pieces almost don't get displaced. And then you're mainly confronted with the pieces' form-stability, not so much with their lightness.

 Part of the reputation would be that any theist stuff (posts and comments) gets downvoted here - most of the time, that's true, and I think that if a comment clearly aims to answer a question without having a shitty tone, too low effort, etc., then people should *upvote* it, that's how the system is supposed to work!

This would discourage theists less to post here, and this subreddit is clearly strong enough not to suffer upvoted theistic statements.

 I'm currently on [Borderlands 1.5](http://store.steampowered.com/app/261640/) ("pre-sequel"), which I find to be at least as much fun as 1 2, though I have to admit: I cheat this time (didn't before). Infinite money (savegame editor from GameCopyWorld). Because you just get killed too much, often seriously not your fault, because of spots you can fall into. I also rather found that aspect frustrating than stimulating. Also, the loss of money is quite significant, and you just don't make enough money in BL1.5, imho.

 No, it's rather "You feel dirty? Wash yourself.", and we're pondering whether you're rather a funny pen drawing on the forearm instead of actual dirt. My stance is the former. Let's keep you around. 




 It's also intuitive for people who have seen various phases of the Moon many times. The association of a sphere comes up. The brain does derive shapes and distances via a lot of other factors *automatically* (Not a process requiring immediate consciousness / thinking.), and similar things would apply to Earth: How far can you look from *this* mountain? Ok, now what do you see from *that* mountain, thousands of kilometers away? etc.

Someone who infers that the Earth is a "sphere" might just have a very strong Occam's Razor aspect in their mind, something we all have, it's part of our base functionality. "First, assume that the other similar thing is indeed the same thing with changed properties." Applies e.g. to the coexistence of beings. 




 Come on, do you really think like that? That's hilarious. If you would not believe in the outside world, evolution would kill you. Brains that did accept the outside world properly were obviously favored.

You have to bend over backwards so far that you break in half if you want to assemble logic that calls serious doubt on what I just said.

Now, to bring God into the discussion: You can't observe him, only via interpretation, and that interpretation may well be incorrect. But it is *sure as perception itself* BY FAR not on the same level as the obviousness of the outside world.

Axiom my ass, seriously. 




 Side-note: All there is *is* empty space: All matter is made of point-like particles which themselves are just a stable construct of energy. When we experience matter in any way whatsoever, all we're experiencing is forces. Solid stuff like we interpret everyday life matter just doesn't exist. 




 I would have said "appeal to gullibility", but not a malicious one: Obviously, OP is gullible themself. 




 What about the already mentioned Texas sharpshooter fallacy? Someone makes 100 claims, some of them are right, then you only look at the right ones and say: "Wow, this guy has it all figured out". 




 If a person does not believe that at all times when they are not looking, a 5 meter tall demon stands behind their back, then they are not an "a-....-ist", because that's such a singular weird claim that it doesn't have importance. Also, it's easily disprovable via peer review, or the person would have to have quite a few more extreme beliefs (quasi solipsism).

But since theism plays a significant role in human society, not being a theist *does* deserve its own term, and that term is "a-theist". Let's not go over the historical definitions of this word but instead use the logic I just presented: "I am not a theist." is equivalent to saying "I am an atheist." (Any specifics, e.g. "I am convinced that no god(s) exist.", have to be communicated in addition.) It just *makes sense* to have a word that describes "Not part of this set." if the set is important enough.

And not being part of that set is not a belief. The fact that you don't believe in that weird concept I described in the first few lines doesn't make that a belief, right? You only think about atheism as a belief, because *theism* thinks about something that affects the nature of all of existence, so to a theist it seems as if not sharing that belief is itself a belief.

But if you think about it: That demon-concept above does have huge implications for the whole world. What if half of mankind would have that belief? Bang, same situation.

You have to realize that people who try to believe as many true and as few false things as possible are just *reasonable*. They just have a much stricter filter than you. Calling that a belief isn't just wrong, as pointed out above, it's even the opposite of what would be appropriate. 




 Let's make this short: You should have said "equal options". E.g. if there were two identical doors in a room I suddenly find myself in, and one leads into a broom closet, the other lets me leave, and both doors look exactly alike, then the chance that I pick the correct door is indeed 0.5

If the broom closet door looks like one while the other is central in the room and big and decorated, then the chances are not equal.

But this is all just semantic stuff. You did have this in mind when you wrote the post, I assume, so let's move on. 




 Yep. By this guy's ill definition, someone who does not have a religion has a religion, too. How obvious can the error get?

 No idea, and I did 68K assembler around 1990 on Amiga. I think it's a mix of circle-jerk and cock-sucking (like "oh, Mr celebrity Sir, I must find everything you do wonderful"). 




 I would say that it just needs you to start on a much lower level, but at the end of the day, you're just stacking subroutine layers like in any other language. The lowness of the level you have to start with is indeed removed from intuition, but it's not like you have to try to XOR (and such) bits with each other all day like it happens on chip level. The most important part is that you need to have knowledge of the machine itself you're working with, but I guess it's relatively fun to do for a probe because you're really starting at the bottom instead of having to learn the operating system's stuff first. Of course, NASA's requirements for code are a different story altogether. 




 Was quite normal to use on Amiga for game programming. Though Motorola 68000 assembler is relatively luxurious. No idea how it is with today's processors / with the processors NASA used. 




 Pretty sure that its claws inadvertently stuck to the thing, which caused modulated behavior, which resulted in the straight two-paws throw.

 E.g. it might have rotated a bit. Whoever has sat down in such a situation learns that even this unimportant seeming change easily leads to very macroscopic consequences.

 That's kinda ironic, because a shit-*post* would rather be a *post* (Not a *comment*.) that has a useless title and/or blatantly ignores the most obvious subreddit rules. 




 Wouldn't it be easier to allude to what the hunch is instead of making OP go through the trouble of selecting what code to post and then to post it? 




 There are probably better answers to your question. But still:

What's wrong with using String? Max length is 2,147,483,647 characters.

Of course, if you're changing the text (e.g. adding bits to it), you should use StringBuilder because it doesn't make a new object each time.

Another way to store a bunch of data is a byte array. There are even methods to directly convert to and from byte array (e.g. from/to String). 




 There are like 90 bazillion variations of Christianity - you can be sure that not all of them believe that homosexuality is a sin. But even without using this logic, I am pretty sure I know of such Christians, I'm currently just not sure of my memory.

But what I was actually suggesting is that there are *other* god concepts out there which don't say "God has a problem with homosexuals!" at all, and your original argument does not touch those. 




 The Bible-god supposedly does not accept homosexuals. If that's the only god you do not believe in, you're merely not an Abrahamic believer. There are sooooo many god-ideas out there which do not fall under this category. 




 The big hole in your logic is that this just makes the existence of a god not accepting of homosexual people unlikely. Doesn't mean that there is *no* god. If that's the reason you're an atheist, then you need to think about this.
