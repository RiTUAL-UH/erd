 That Becky Lynch armbar is pretty nice 




 I have no clue but it is fucking stupid 




 Sounds like the fans are to blame for where he is now.   




 I'm sure he enjoys it to a point.  Plus the $$$ is nice 




 I'd feel perfectly fine with it to be honest.  I wouldn't whine about it like you. 




 Ambrose 




 wow I can't believe yet another person is complaining about Stephanie. 




 FUCK FIN BALORRRRRRRRR! 




 It was one of his best... then I loved when the match started he just sat there contemplating almost like he was going to pull a Seven style promo where he would just drop the gimmick.  Then he snapped back into Stardust. 




 **fingers crossed** please be Zack Ryder 




 No it means they are joining another clusterfuck bandwagon that this site loves.  It just becomes the cool thing to complain about so everyone wants to do it to get karma. 




 Wow you are whining about the same thing hundreds of other have already whined about and made posts of on here.  You are a true original. 




 Bitchy black woman teams up with other Bitchy black woman 




 They mentioned it last week if I'm not mistaken 




 So I guess we're going to post every tweet this account makes

Yup because they are fucking funny

 Probably Stardust

 Just like daddy Rikishi!  ...wait? 




 It was AJ Lee but now that she is gone it is between Wyatt and HHH (Game HHH not King of Kings COO HHH) 




 Keep an eye out for the friends of the road Bubs 




 Rusev 




 Curb Stomp (nobody realistically sits there in the position waiting to be hit with it)

 What's the difference between this joke and the 50+ others that are the exact same and already posted?  No seriously I am asking this.

 Chris Jericho 




 Michaels,  hhh, flair 




 Zack Ryder 




 People that whine about everything and think they know better what should be done 




 ... and that's how I got fired from being a teacher 




 What makes you think things will be fun if there are GMs?   




 Elevation X with the ring full of flaming tables and the ringside area covered in thumbtacks.  There are chairs and kendo sticks up on the platforms 




 He will draw it out, then come back and say he isn't retiring.  Then in a month he will go out with another injury and we will have this convo again. 




 Alright how do I report a serial killer and utter psychopath that I found on reddit? 




 Cheeseburgers, pizza, etc etc 




 Something tells me it is not "forgotten". 




 Superkick... fucking Young Bucks ruined what was a great move 




 Zach Gowen returns and gets his revenge on Lesnar 




 Slator Gator, The Rock and Sock Connection, Two Man Power Trip 




 Guy looks like he is auditioning for the Shield with that getup 




 Light it up--aj lee.  Guilty pleasure of mine 




 Aj easily on theme (my guilty pleasure).  Paige slightly more so on in ring skills.   Aj is sexier  (and yes I know I'll get shit on for saying this) 




 HHH attacking and injuring Michaels and Michaels' long journey to retribution (culminating in his title win at Elimination Chamber. 




 It's quasi-wrestling.  [Celebrity Deathmatch](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Celebrity_Deathmatch_Coverart.png) 




 Hitting that would be like throwing a hot dog down a hallway... I'm all set 




 Vintage! 




 /r/justwatchtvandstopgoingontheinternet 




 3 Stages of Hell 




 It's something but it was one of my favorite finds.  Best thing with this game is that there is always something new to find.  Took me forever to find the big park up in the hills where people bring their dogs. 




 Make Vince do a bunch of pills to get him to re-sign Jeff Hardy 




 Yes you are missing it completely.  Lesnar is a tweener who is used where needed.  He is a face now, just a bad ass ass-kicking face.   




 Because if they didn't have them, it wouldn't look as cool when Brock brought the whole axes out 




 Booyakah Booyakah my spring failed... Mysterio at Mania 26 when his spring failed to launch him from under the stage

 I don't know why ~~Tito Ortiz~~ **any big hyped person from Dizie** did not get a reaction in the Impact Zone.. 




 I have seen it... it's at the Rehab facility up in the mountains right? 




 yeah I couldn't care less about how it's pronounced 




 Orton... everything after the "voices" storyline where he attacked the McMahon family has just sucked. 




 "I submit" =/= "I quit" lol 




 Sal and Rocco? 




 Unless you're Rusev and never say it but instead Lana does lol 




 Unless you're Cena in the Accolade in an I Quit match lol 




 The S.S. Mahfacka 




 If anything HHH should come out as [this](https://tomandmikepresentt.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/vlcsnap-2011-04-07-15h42m42s61.png) 




 Eugene. ..definitely Eugene 




 More than can be explained in a reddit comment.  Here's my advice... go back and watch stuff 




 The Queen 




 If only there were wrestlers known as Dusty Runnels and Cody Runnels.  I know it's their real name but I was going by the wrestlers' names 




 We eat steaks on Thursday nights MAGGLE! 




 Rhodes (Dusty, Cody, Goldust) -- https://www.houseofnames.com/Rhodes-family-crest 




 I like Sheamus and think he is a good Mr MITB choice 




 The show that gravity forgot.   Neville main events aboard the us space station 




 Whata maneuver! 




 Batista on Stardust in Starbucks 




 Reigns was, Kevin Dunn was, Michael Cole was, JBL was... it is the flavor of the week

 In the opposite direction of suplex city 




 His fiance  




 Wwe gimmicks redone with zz 




 Where reigns disappeared to after attacking fake Wyatt 




 Real reason Owens backed down from cesaro 




 Kane's favorite part of his Hawaii trip 




 Michaels accidentally eliminating himself in his 1st Rumble 




 A newspaper  :D 




 Look: Cena/Titus

Promo: Cena/Owens/Rollins

In Ring: Owens/Cesaro

Total: Cena 




 Lesnar is easily Goro 




 Oh he was great when he was full-blown Russian hero
