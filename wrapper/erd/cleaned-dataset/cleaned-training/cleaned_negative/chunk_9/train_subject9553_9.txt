Shackles that are painted gold are still in fact shackles.  














 Fair enough, as long as you know.  




 Sorry to tell you this, but you've been shadow banned. I manually approved this comment because I thought it provided good information.  

















































 This is real progress, they are actually debating freezing partial settlement building. 

I just love how a few years ago BDS wasn't considered a serious issue to Israeli politicians, now they consider it "the most serious existential threat to Israel".

Vote with your dollars people, its the only power you have.

 Red Ice is great.

Doggcatcher, another podcast app, used by Android users, also censored Red Ice shortly after iTunes did so.

I just go to their website now for their content. I don't have another choice.  













































































































 They have carefully removed it from all of the default subs. The default subs like /r/news and /r/worldnews don't have anything about it. 

Even though /r/technology and /r/politics have 5 million and 3 million subscribers respectively, they aren't default subs. 

Which means that any stories in these subs will only preach to the converted. The users of /r/technology, /r/politics and /r/conspiracy are already aware of the perils of this trade deal. 

Its the unwitting victims of propaganda on /r/worldnews and /r/news that should be seeing this TPP-related content.  















































































































































































































































 Removed, violation of rule 10 of the sub. Continued violations will result in a ban from /r/conspiracy.  







































 [Here is an episode of the Corbett Report podcast called *Who Was Really Behind the 9/11 Attacks* ?](https://www.corbettreport.com/who-was-really-behind-the-911-attacks/)

I think its a must listen for anyone interested in alternative theories about 9/11.  

















































 Thank you for pointing that out, I must have forgot to remove it, despite messaging that user about it. I went ahead and removed it now, feel free to message me in the future if you notice another mistake like that.  
























 Removed. Violation of rule #1 of the sub, continued violations will result in a ban from /r/conspiracy.  














 In this situation one side clearly seems to be more criminally insane than the other. 

How could the US's actions not be perceived as hostile, they're talking about placing weaponry and light infrantry along Russia's border. The US is without a doubt the aggressor in this situation.
