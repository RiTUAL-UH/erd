Let us know if you can summarize in layman's terms. 




 I don't think the mask does any focusing.  At 3:45 into the video, Professor Merrifield says "... by the time you get to the hard x-ray end and gamma ray end of things, nothing you can do will focus the light effectively ... All the mask does is throw a shadow."  So the mask only tells you what direction each x-ray or gamma ray point source is coming from.  They must use some sort of deconvolution algorithm that processes the multiple copies of the overlaid/shifted mask shadows striking the sensor to determine the position of each source.  I imagine without the ability to focus, the telescope's resolution is limited by the sensor's pixel size and is not very high.

 Flare selection: He's on a different planet. 



















 I think the strongest statement that can be gleaned from this article regarding the Philae lander's position is that it *may* have been found.

From the article:
 But is this really Philae? Unfortunately, it is impossible to be sure. 
















































































































































 At least one dictionary* defines Deep Space as regions outside of the Earth/Moon system (where DSCOVR's orbit would qualify), but most define it as regions outside of our solar system.  In any case, I hear what you're saying. Maybe they were searching a bit too hard for a good acronym.

 Dug a little bit to find PayPal's updated ToS:

 Not psychic, just reading PayPal's upcoming ToS.

 I e-mailed Nomorobo with my question about their business model and they responded quickly:

 Thanks for asking, 
 
 Our business model is based on licensing our blacklist data to carriers. The incoming call data from Nomorobo users powers the detection algorithm.
 
 That being said, your personal data is never shared with anyone else. It's only used to detect when one number is calling LOTS of consumers. Then Nomorobo knows to blacklist it.
 
 Did that answer your question in enough detail?

Sounds like a credible business model.  I signed up and it was a fairly easy process. 




 That sounds like a great service (it won the FTC Robocall Challenge).  But I wonder what their business model is.  Are the users the product? 























































































































 When you get your watch, open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, go to Privacy, select Motion   Fitness, then toggle off Heart Rate monitoring.   




 Apple was very careful about power conservation in designing the Apple Watch.  The Watch activates infra-red LEDs to measure heart rate during normal (non workout) activity which requires additional power and reduces battery life.  Apple probably made a trade-off between battery life and how often heart rate is needed during normal activity and arrived at 10 minutes as the balance.  Still, it would be nice if the user could set the heart rate sample interval.   









 Yeah, it does seem odd.  During workouts the green LEDs stay on continually even though they are sampling heart rate every 10 seconds.  It may be that the sample window is 10 seconds long but every 10 seconds the watch repeats the sample so the entire timeline is filled with sampling, it's just updated every 10 seconds.  

I have found that if I forget to end a workout and accidentally leave the green LEDs on, the battery drain is significant.  The only times I have run out of power in less than a day is when I've forgotten to end a workout. 




 Regarding your statement
 I agree that if it's inaccurate that this would be a wise move. However, I do not see why this would be the case if we are relying on the heart rate sensor during work out.

Your first sentence makes sense, but the second sentence implies the heart rate sensor used during normal activity is the same as the one used during a workout.  This is not the case.  The heart rate sensor used during normal activity is a pair of infra-red LEDs that sample heart rate every 10 minutes while the sensor for workouts uses green LEDs to measure heart rate every 10 seconds.  The latter method is designed to be more reliable in measuring heart rate than the first at the expense of drawing more power from the battery.

Edit: Correction that the infra-red LEDs are not passive - they emit infra-red energy that is detected by the same photodiodes used to detect the green LED energy.
