 **1775: Rebellion** isn't necessarily gateway, but it's actually pretty light and a lot of fun. It's basically a move and battle game with good tactics. And it's history based. The rulebook offers a lot of history behind the cards and events too which is great. 


**Pandemic** is a very popular game that is lighter and cooperative so can help with the community engagement. The dice version, **Pandemic: The Cure** is great too.


**Takenoko** is a great gateway game. Light, has some depth of strategy and is beautiful looking. It's one of very few games I can get my SO to play. Appeals to a large demographic.


**Bohnanza** is one of my favorites. Very easy to learn, social trading game. Lots of fun.


**Hanabi** is a great social game. Very cheap too. 


**Lords of Vegas** maybe. Just a fun game. Some strategy, but mostly just a fun, crazy time of building casinos, gambling and rolling dice. 


Some other party games like **Wits   Wagers**, **Time's Up!**, **Concept**, **Mascarade**, **Pictomania** and **Snake Oil** are all great options too. Tons of fun there.

edit: pandemic mix up

 You're going to have to narrow it down a little.

If you want something light aka a good gateway game to get people into the hobby, check [this list out](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1116308/top-150-best-gateway-games-results). 

What kind of game are you looking for? A party game? Card game? Something with a lot of strategy? Something with more of an overall experience and story?  




 Do we serve literabeer? 




 Space Hulk? Didn't know there was an app for that. How does it play? The game is so gigantic, I can't imagine it on a phone

 I hadn't heard much of this game, so maybe others haven't either.

Here's the [BGG Link](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148601/1944-race-rhine)

And [SU SD Review](http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/blog/post/review-1944-race-rhine/) 









 Someone will definitely buy/trade it off of you when it's finally released. It'll be like a once cherished relic has been found after eons in the ground.  




 Yea! Came here to say this. Sometimes it's just great to relax and revisit some classic card games like pinochle. And of course wage intense, curse filled battles for hours on family night over them :)  




 Well it was $40.32 at Amazon when I posted. I wasn't lying. Just sharing information, that's why I put all the prices in the title.  




 Yes, can't believe I forgot **Libertalia**. So much fun.  




 Right. And generally speaking, if you're the home team for Games 1-2, you're the better team...and the better team will win more often than not.  




 **Jamaica** might fit very well as a lighter option with all that heavy stuff your group. Quick, light, fun pirate themed game. 


**Archipelago** may fit the bill! Cooperative with secret objectives, it's a nautical/resource/economic management game. Lots of fun.


**Panamax** was just released to pretty strong reviews. Haven't played it myself, but it has ships that do ship things I guess. 


**Le Havre** technically has a port/nautical theme, and regardless of theme it's a phenomenal game.


**Amerigo** is a great Feld game where you discover new lands and develop trade routes etc. 


**Black Fleet** is also a lot of fun, and a little lighter if you want.

 "NHL To Seattle" doesn't sound like a biased website at all.  




 As a living non-viking Sabres fan, I have literally no idea.  









 That kid is going places. Most likely jails, but still...places. 




 This. Can incorporate your collection, track plays etc. Very useful 




 Thanks. Not sure why I'm being downvoted lol 




 I don't think I have ever seen a "the team that wins Game X wins the series Y% of the time" that was not in their favor. Every single time the winner of a given game has won the series more often than not. I'm sick of these stats. 


After Game 1 all I heard for Blackhawks was "the team that wins game 1 wins the stanley cup 284456% of the time." After Game 2 for Lightning, "the team that wins Game 2 has never allowed a goal ever again." After Game 3, "any team that has won Games 2 and 3 of Finals is automatically given the cup and enshrined in Valhalla for eternity."  




 I wouldn't even break it up into sessions. You'd still have to sit through 2-3 hours of video to watch someone play a game. People won't do that. Even Rahdo trims his down to under an hour and then gives a separate link if you really want to watch the extended gameplay. Look at what TableTop does in a lot of their videos...at some point they typically have an 'In the interest of time..." cut montage. And in the normal span of the video, they've edited out down time in the gameplay.  




 If you want people to watch your videos, just a bit of advice for you...


No one has ever woken up one day and said "I'd like to watch a two and a half hour still cam video of someone playing Smash Up." 


As soon as I saw that run time, it was a big nope. Need to learn to edit and trim it down to a manageable viewing experience.

Too soon? 




 Have expensive shipping: people complain

Negotiate new low-rate deal with Fed-Ex: people complain.  




 All good games, but personally I'd absolutely lean to **Eclipse**, especially with 4x. It's a beautifully designed game. It scales well, you can feel the game escalate as you go, there are lots of different viable paths to victory. Battle is a lot of fun, and the alien races really help to further mix it up and add variety.  




 Thank you, this was the answer I was looking for.

 Unless you upped the shipping to air, it will go ground. Probably around 5-7 days give or take, depending where you.  




 Warning: that link goes directly to the facebook app store with a pop up to install the game.  




 Yea but for $1,499 you can get a *limited edition game AND a digital copy AND a look at how they made the art!* What a deal! 




 This. I'm more into heavier games. But I have some friends that I just can't get to sit down for those, and Stone Age will fit a nice medium niche for me. I have lots of heavy stuff. 




 That's a sweet old card table. Great find. It's a card table so any kind of 4P trick taking game would be perfect...**Ticchu**, **Diamonds**, **Chimera** (3P). Small 2P games would be great too: **Jaipur**, **Targi**, **Battle Line**, **Hive**, **The Duke**, **Race For the Galaxy**.

Other 2-4P games that don't take up much room that I can think of quickly...**Blueprints**, **Dominion**, **Bohnanza**, **Love Letter** (or any micro game), **Forbidden Desert**, **Hanabi**, **Scrabble**, **King of Tokyo**, **King of New York**, **Spyrium**.

 Great point. I have all but 2 dominion expansions anyway, and a couple of those have barely been touched. Plus what /u/Grey-Ferret said about the card stock issues, I'm dropping Adventures for now.  




 She says that's not an option :( 









 Any other game you'd compare it to? 




 Have had this in my Amazon Wishlist (along with basically every board game) for awhile. Just noticed the price drop today. Thoughts on this game? Has pretty good ratings on bgg 




 Do I like the game? Does the expansion look cool? Do I have money? If I have answered yes to these three questions, then the expansion will be purchased. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWM7q0BZm2Y 




 Yea, but aren't they just deals because no one likes those games?? 




 Nice try, Hillary pollsters. 




 I've seen this on reddit before 




 Those are cool and all, but am I the only that doesn't really care about buying fancy dice? There's so many of these things popping up now.  




 Agreed. That guy is way too old to be wearing American Eagle.

 Brevity helps more than it hurts.  




 Your econ professor should learn about cause and effect. 




 My strategy in Dead of Winter: have the most fun as possible. I lean towards heavy euros, and DoW is the one more thematic co-op game I can really get into. The game objectives and secret objectives mix it up so much, and the group dynamic has such a high delta, I just roll with it each time. Have fun, mix it up! Enjoy the crossroads, doing new things. At least, that's what works for me.

 A lot of Stefan Feld games scale wonderfully well. **Castles of Burgundy** is fantastic at any player count. **Trajan** scales well too and to mix it up, different strategies work better at different player counts. I've enjoyed **Aquasphere** and **Bora Bora** a lot with various player counts too.

 If you're asking for feedback...

* Just posting here and saying "Here's the link" doesn't show much effort or passion for your game


* Most importantly, the backer levels are insane. $20 or $35 just for a freaking digital image of the game?? What is that about? $50 for a game that looks like that? Seems high. Then another $100 **FOR TWO GLOW IN THE DARK DICE?!** WHAT?? $250 for a game, two dice and an autograph from someone that's never designed a game before?? And $750 for a glossy version?? At this point it starts to read and feel like a scam. 

I wouldn't touch this kickstarter with a 100 foot pole.

 Vino's on Elmwood is a great local mom   pop spot. Small menu Italian food that is outstanding. Intimate and not that expensive at all. 




 I'd say hop into some others. If you have your eyes set on Prosperity   Seaside, go for it; they're both great. You can find plenty of comparison threads in this sub on all the expansions. and www.dominionstrategy.com as well has tons and tons of info 




 You're factually untrue. 

^^nailed ^^it. 




 I think Intrigue is the better game. Slightly more advanced cards, ~~more player interaction~~, a bit more depth to strategy and variety in the kingdoms. You won't go wrong either way, but I'd give an edge to Intrigue. 


edit: not more player interaction. I'm wrong. Taken from the Dominion Wiki...

 "Intrigue developed a somewhat unfounded reputation as a highly attack-heavy expansion: in actuality, Intrigue contains fewer Attack cards than the base set and fewer than the next expansion, Seaside. This reputation arises in part from the fact that the Attack cards Intrigue does have all have a reputation as particularly annoying attacks to get hit by (even the relatively weak Saboteur, which is unpleasant out of proportion to how effective it is), and in part because it has some non-Attack cards (Masquerade and Tribute) that affect players in ways that occasionally make them feel like they're being attacked." 




 the fuck is motivating about this? 




 If I've learned anything from following Chip on twitter it's that he hates spelling out "you" and he fucking loves exclamation marks.  




 If you want a loose, fun, gambling type game check out **Lords of Vegas**. 

**Acquire** is an absolute classic. 

**For Sale** is about buying   selling real estate

**Last Will** is almost the reverse. Super fun game about blowing your inheritance as fast as possible.

**Merchant of Venus** may be a stretch, but in that you're playing space traders seeking the biggest fortune.

 **The Duke** is a 2P game where you're moving tiles on a board, akin to chess. The only functional things you'll need to do is move a tile, flip a tile or pick a tile out of a bag. If she can't, you could do those for her. 


Can your wife at least pick little things up with 2 fingers? A lot of worker placement games might work. **Le Havre** (cards are laid out in front of you, not in hand), **Bora Bora**, **Manhattan Project**, **Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar** there aren't cards-in-hand involved; just moving/placing workers or goods.  




 Is this a charger for your charger? 




 * **Time's Up!** may be an option (the first 2 rounds at least) since it's auditory based. 

* **Bananagrams** and **Scrabble** both have [braille](http://www.amazon.com/Deluxe-Scrabble-Game-Braille-Version/dp/B000YL1XEM) [versions](http://www.maxiaids.com/products/10070/Bananagrams-Word-Game-with-Braille-Tiles.html).

* Lastly and likely most beneficial, a [recent Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/64ouncegames/board-games-now-blind-accessible/description) for **64 Oz Games** put out a product that helps (some) board games become blind accessible with transparent sleeves and custom dice.

 It's much more interactive. Instead of just having 'Tokyo' as the board, the board is all 5 burroughs of NYC, and Manhattan acts as 'Tokyo.' If you're not in Manhattan, you have to be in one of the other burroughs, so everyone is always on the board. Each burrough also gets 3 stacks of 3 tiles that act as buildings on one side that you can knock over (the dice are different in KoNY). You can get points/energy/hearts for knocking them over but once you destroy a building, it releases military vehicles/tanks/planes that can attack you, so it litters danger for your monster all over the board (you can also defeat these with die rolls). 

It adds more strategic decisions besides just "to punch or not to punch" and "get points." It's great.  




 You know you can spend 2 energy to clear the current cards and draw new ones, right?

 With the track record of prior first time publishers having a lot of problems   delays (i.e. Two Rooms and A Boom) getting their game out once they receive a successful (or maybe more problematically, very successful) funding, how can use ease concerns one may have on your game? Do you have an infrastructure in place to meet foreseeable demands, especially with delivery dates listed as soon as August 2015. What does that production infrastructure look like? What if you double/triple/quadruple your goal? 


I wish you the best of luck!  




 Yea! Love the turn order board. My group hasn't played with the auction mechanic yet, but I imagine that would be fun. 




 Seriously. Do it. TM is my favorite game, the expansion makes it even better. The new races are so cool, and they each terraform and grow in a unique way; very different from how the base races play. And you get a whole new board! Well, well worth it.  




 I've heard of this but don't know too much about it. What's it like? Any good?
