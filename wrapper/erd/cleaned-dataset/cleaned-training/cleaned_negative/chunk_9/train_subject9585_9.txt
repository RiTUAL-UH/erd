 People are loosing their minds over this issue. Whatever you beliefs are you have the right to express them regardless if I agree with you or not. For example, recently there was a group of individuals who beat up a man carrying the Army of Tennessee flag. Here is a link to the video.

It is a shame the people that cheer on this kind violence and destruction of property that isn't theirs.  




 If you make a poster that I disagree with and consider rude, because what is rude is subjective, do I have the right to assault you and destroy your property. Funny how left-wing extremists such as yourself only support free speech when it is something that you agree with but not for others with whom you disagree with.
