 Yep. Worked at freebirds for 3 or 4 months. Ate there every single day and still do all the time. In other words nothing even the least bit shady or unsanitary happened at all. I can roll a sexy ass burrito now too.  




 Pretty sure it was with a keyboard.

 Because they are hilarious entertainers who care so little about what people think and the career advancement opportunities going to Oscars gives them that they do something as insane as show up in dresses and on LSD? Keep in mind this is in like 1999 they weren't anywhere near as famous as today. Because they are able to keep composed at what was surely one of the weirdest experiences of their life. Even something as normal as a party is pretty weird if you're tripping and around a bunch of sober/drunk people. I can't even imagine what the Oscars is like. 




 Dude I can't believe they did that. Tripping at the Oscars while wearing a dress would be a little too much for me and I'm pretty well acquainted with acid. [You can see Trey almost lose it for a second in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsvQuJmASSk#t=103), I can only imagine the feeling. Before I knew the story, I didn't think it was possible to respect them more than I did but I was wrong. They're at the very top of my list of living people to trip with for sure. 




 I'll bring young Steve Jobs, Matt Stone and Trey Parker and we'll get funky.  




 Grab Jim Morrison, Aldus Huxley and Timothy Leary while you're at it. 




 Add Jim Morrison and Chris Farley and unlimited drugs and we got a party. 




 Let's say a method for delivering the antifreeze protein directly is discovered. Maybe it's a pill, maybe it's a lotion it doesn't matter. I'd imagine there probably wouldn't be a HUGE market for it but there would definitely be a market. Any extreme mountain climber who is going to be in the cold for extended periods of time would want to use it just to be safe. Going a step further, it might be possible to convince people they will be safer using it when they aren't really high risk for getting frostbite. By convincing parents to use it to keep their children playing outside in the snow safe or convincing skiers they might regret not using it, you might be able to get a much larger market. This could be done through some clever advertising campaigns.

Regardless what this affects most is definitely organ transplant and it could definitely be a game changer for that. 









 I don't speak Russian but putting the words into google translate gives 'Winner of socialist competition' in English.

 The documentary really paints the picture that Edward Bernays is one of the most influential people of the 20th century. I feel like the intent of the  documentary was more to tell a compelling story than to showcase multiple points of view or interpretations of the events but I honestly have no idea. Hoping someone who is basing their view off more than a single documentary can let me know what they think of the film's accuracy or bias.

Saw this same question was [posted about two years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z2fs9/how_accuratebias_was_century_of_the_self/) but the responses seemed a bit underwhelming, hoping it's OK to repost.

 I met Afroman when he was performing at a frat house in Alabama(went to Georgia Tech and happened to be in the same frat so we took a trip out there). I got to hang out with him in his trailer after the show and he was the funniest person I have ever met. 

Someone asked him about the football game that was the next day and he just goes 'Nigga I don't do sports, I do drugs that way I always win'. Whole night was filled with hilarious quotes like that he just made up. Someone asked him what kind of weed he buys and he goes 'Man I'm like the marijuana IRS I don't pay I just collect. Ended up getting his DJ's number (DJ Milkyway) and hung out with them a couple other times before and during their shows. I can proudly say I have smoked a blunt with Afroman while he sang Colt 45 on stage and rolled up to his shows with him for this show...

 Anyways he usually had this huge 6'7" black body guard. I'm convinced that dude just took that job because he liked kicking rich white kids asses as Afroman plays a lot of frat parties. Wonder why that guy wasn't with him

 Definitely had it with lexapro myself maybe it varies from person to person. 




 Another flaw I saw is that it seems like the gave the mice Paxil for a couple weeks and when they started the survival of the fittest test they just completely stopped the Paxil dosage. SSRIs are addictive, if you forget to take them one day, you feel really foggy headed and unable to really think properly to the point where it affects work and social life. The results of this experiment could easily be due to the withdrawal.  




 Just thought of another [Down to the River to Pray by Alison Krauss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSif77IVQdY)  

Not 100% sure it fits what OP is asking for but I it is a cover and its acappella not acoustic. Then again acapella is kind of a subset of acoustic.   




 Wow I had never even considered they could make a collab album and how incredible it would be. Now I'm really sad that this doesn't exist thanks you bastard. 

 




 Ben Gibbard has the best fucking voice.  I'm a straight man and I want to marry him just so he can serenade me at night and follow me into the dark.  




 Pretty good list honestly but here a couple covers I really like not on there. **Edit**: Thinking about it I'm pretty sure most of these are actually acoustic. Sorry I'm dumb but I'm just gonna leave them cause they're still great covers.

Across the Universe - Rufus Wainwright  
Over the rainbow - Israel Kamakawiwo'ole  
Hallelujah - Rufus Wainwright  
Total Eclipse of the Heart - The Dan Band
**Warning this one is not really very gentle**   
Mrs. Robinson - Lemon heads 




 Haha its a band? I'm dumb I thought it was some acronym that this subreddit uses like IIL or WEWIL. Even tried to go to the wiki to figure it out 




 Oh I do for sure. Glad I found this subreddit cause I've found some great new bands. Wish my friends weren't all about music I'm not really a fan of like mash ups, dub step or whatever people can it nowadays and country.  




 Pretty legit site I have to say. A memory hog for sure though, I looked at chrome's task manager and it alone was taking over 1GB of memory. Ridiculous, I'm gonna hope that was a memory leak or something and not how they designed it. 




 Not quite sure I understand WU LYF. Anyways haven't hear of Future Islands, broken bells or Surjan Stevens so thanks I'll check em out. 




 Am I missing something or does your Super Furry Animals link to Modest Mouse. Not that I don't love me some modest mouse just was confused for a second. Anyways thanks been liking em so far. 




 Been listening to all of these and loving pretty much all of them. Since apparently we have the same taste in music I'm gonna be so bold as to recommend some bands/songs to you its only fair. I'm sure you've hear some of these. 

John Butler Trio- Better Than, Used to get High, Ocean ( absolutely amazing solo instrumental on a 12 string. Actually watch [this live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYJf_ybyVo), to fully appreciate just how fucking good he is)

Dispatch- The General  
Sea Wolf- Middle Distance Runner  
Iron   Wine - Boy with a coin  
Matt Costa- Mr. Pitiful  
Jose Gonzalez- Heartbeats  
Two Door Cinema Club- SOmething good can work  
Dr Dog- Heart it races
James Yulli- No surpise

Actually you know what feel free to check out [my grooveshark playlist](http://grooveshark.com/playlist/1111/103994753). It has all of these songs and more, pretty much all my favorite songs right now.

Edit: Feel free to check out [this playlist](http://grooveshark.com/playlist/11New/98252792)t too, some overlap but for the most part this is all my favorite songs from back in the summer.




 




 Yeah for sure I'd love a couple song suggestions for each band. Since I already listen to and love Arcade Fire, Grouplove and Bloc Party maybe not those bands. All I know by Miike Snow is Animals so I'd be down to listen a different song by them(him?). Anyways appreciate it always love finding new music. 




 Any specifics songs you could recommend to start with? Loving The High Road right now thanks to /u/aesthetic-as-fuck. 




 You can throw Phoenix, Matt   Kim, Citizen Cope, Noah and the Whale, Death Cab, and LCD Soundsystem in there too. Anyways those are some of my favorite bands right now and I'm always on the prowl for new music so I'd love to hear some recommendations.  




 Here's a clickable link to help those lazy people like me.

Anyways just started listening to it, liking it so far thanks. 




 They're a fucking great band of course they do. I love me some Gone for Good or caring is creepy.  




 Didn't realize this was posted 2 months ago... and also 3 months ago... oops. Not much of an /r/Music browser and I'm also kind of dumb and didn't think to search. Reddit brought me to a post with 3 upvotes when I tried to post the first time so I just went ahead it.

My bad but still its a fucking great song.  I'd love to hear some recommendations of songs along the same lines as New Slang or these songs.

 I'd place so hard all over that girls face 




 Instead of bridges and public works my vote would be to move the money into education. We need to start giving teachers a reasonable salary. Granted this wouldn't be creating new jobs but I think our education system is absolutely horrid compared to many developed nations.

 









 I agree 100%. Airlines would rather not pay for security than have to pony up some money and they're not losing any money because of the TSA so they're not gonna fight it. Any senator or congressman who brings up abolishing the TSA is going to pay a heavy price in the election when their opponent spins it into saying they want any other 9/11 or don't care about America. Its not gonna change anytime soon unfortunately.  




 Terrible dance moves and creepin super hard on Katy Perry is just so Place. 




  the most successfully performing passenger screening program weve had over the last decade

Isn't this the **only** passenger screening program we've had over the last decade? Its also the least successful performing passenger screening program of the past decade too... 




 I disagree. We need a bit of airport security, like what it was pre-9/11. 




 I would not trust almost anyone who works at the TSA to build a bridge that is safe honestly. Maybe with competent supervisors but most don't seem like the type to do physical labor. Not too it wouldn't be a good thing for them, a lot definitely need the exercise.  




 You're just all over the place with your apostrophes here. You only need to put one of those when you are signifying possession, not making a word plural.   




 Yeah man, I'm a somewhat quiet guy, I've only been asked this like a single time luckily.

 I think you just gotta answer confidently with something like this 'I'm one of those people who will talk your ear off if you get to know me but it takes me a little bit for me to warm up to groups of people'. or 'I dunno man, guess I'm just one of those people who only talks when I actually have something to say'.

 If the person who asks you is an asshole who talks to an excess and it seem like they are insulting you this one is a bit less nice  'Well I'm one of those people who only talks when *I actually have something to add to the conversation*'

 




 It's probably the best answer. You can say it in one of two ways, 'I dunno man I guess I'm just one of the people that only talks when I have something to add to the conversation'. Or if the guy who's asking the question is a loud asshole that talks excessively 'Well I'm one of those people who only talks when I *actually have something to add to the conversation*' 









 And if you do try to jump in and someone else starts talking over you don't take it as an insult. This is just how group dynamics work. After that person is done talking and if your question or thought is still relevant try again in a bit more of an assertive manner. Odds are no one is actively trying to be rude to you, they are much more concerned with themselves and getting what they want to say in than being rude to you. 




 Asking this isn't always done with ill intentions. There's a possibility they legitimately are trying to include you in the conversation and just don't have the social graces to realize this is an offensive question. Since they're not quiet people the fact that this might be rude just never crosses their mind.  




 This is all contextual. If the person who asks you this is kind of an asshole who is one of those people that talks to an excess and they seem like they are insulting you you could say 'I'm one of those people who only talks when I actually have something to say'. This might make tensions a little high so be careful with that.

 If you're in a group of people many of whom you don't know well you might say 'I'm one of those people who will talk your ear off if you get to know me but it takes me a little bit for me to warm up to groups of people'. 

It you want to make a morbid joke that will make people really uncomfortable unless they realize your joking which they probably won't say 'Been like that since the accident man'. Actually don't say that one. 

Really option number 2 is your best bet unless you feel really insulted in which case I'd go with number 1.


 




 Now we are getting into semantics but the way I see it in this case they are one in the same. 




 For me it was Charlie from Its Always Sunny

Obviously from that court episode where Charlie and Frank are caught naked and stuck in a chimney after trying to break into the Rodin museum. They were hoping to consult The Thinker when he comes alive that night to settle a domestic dispute. To explain why they weren't breaking and entering of course they tell the court a fantastical story. 

Like any other night Charlie and Frank were hanging out under the bridge after a long nights romp in the sewers. Charlie is given a book of spells by a friendly ghoul while Frank scavenges for bird eggs to eat. As Frank and Charlie begin to feast on the scavenged dove eggs, Charlie reads a spell that just so happens to be written in drawings and scribbles. Due to the eggs they are eating and Charlie's expertise for bird law the spell turns both Frank and Charlie into doves. They fly around the city for a while until a hawk, who obviously does not give a shit about bird law, starts hunting them. Fleeing for their life they find the nearest chimney to hide. The spell soon wears off and since their human clothes fell off when they became birds they are trapped naked in that chimney. Obviously they are completely not at fault and not dismissing the case would be like endorsing black magic. Charlie motions to counter sue the city of Philly for allowing black magic in the city limits and also to sue the hawk for flagrant disregard of birdlaw. 




 Just noticed this but your username is actually incredibly relevant. 




 This is possibly the worst thing you can ask a quiet person. People have no empathy a lot of the time and really never consider other's point of view.  




 People... What a bunch of bastards. 




 Its scissors about to cut off some dudes dick. 




 The prk probe hybridized with a metaphase chromosome in slug larvae, confirming gene transfer between alga and slug.

That is from the abstract of the paper. I'm not sure exactly how they confirmed it was lateral gene transfer though. I'd like to see just how similar the gene is between the slug and alga because you can't rule out this happening from a mutation of a already present gene in the slug. 




 I don't understand your point, that is completely irrelevant. 




 We are going to be able to do things in a decade or two with genetics that we can barely fathom right now. It will be like someone from 1995 trying to imagine this smart phone I am using right now to type this response. I'm convinced what the digital revolution did to our lives, a biological revolution will do to the younger generation. 



















 What really convinced me was the guy who **worked at area 51** and spoke 7 languages telling OP to stop investigating! That dude is obviously completely legit, this is reallyspooky.^(twilight zone music) My internet conspiracy sense is tingling! That definitely justifies severely harassing the poor owners of some shitty daycare center who may very likely have done absolutely nothing wrong. 

This reminds me a bit of the boston bombing...  



















 I think we found a sympohorophiliac.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphorophilia 




 Looking at the preview of a wikipedia link with noembed, that looks like exactly what ReddHub uses to accomplish this. 




 Yeah I had the DK2 as well, unfortunately we had to cannibalize it for a senior design project but I got to play around with it for 2 months or so before we did that. Got reimbursed for it by my school too!

I can't wait for something like Pixar movies that are compatible with the rift, its gonna be fucking awesome to see an ACTUAL 3D movie. 




 Hasn't Musk mentioned he has an idea about how to pre-manufacture stretches of highway or something like that to cut down on road renovation times? I think its all because he has to sit through traffic construction on a highway near him all the time and it annoys him. Saw this mentioned in some other SpaceX thread. 




 I know but many times it is not the highest upvoted reply to the comment so it is fairly far down the line from where the link was posted. This would just make things a bit more streamlined and when I saw the feature in ReddHub I thought it would be really cool in RES too. 




 Just wanted to confirm that it is in fact ctrl+left click on Windows for anyone wondering. 




 The ReddHubV2 app for Windows 8 has a really neat feature, a Wikipedia expando that is very similar to a video or picture expando. It displays the text of the linked section or if the entire page is linked  it shows the article summary in-line with the comment but in a box of its own, kind of like how the self-post expandos work when you are browsing the frontpage of a subreddit. It is incredibly useful and I just thought it would be very cool in RES too. The presences of /u/autowikibot shows that Reddit users like to be able see the wiki text without actually clicking the link and it makes a lot of sense to have something like this. 




 If you ever have wanted to know how to build a farm on Mars out of a little bit of earth dirt and your own shit, this book is the way to learn it. Seriously though amazing book. Coolest part is its scientific accuracy, Weir is already smart as shit already and NASA scientists sent him proofs outlining why some of the things in the earlier edition of his book wouldn't actually work and these things were changed so it is incredibly accurate. 




 I realize that, I'm just saying its not like they're gonna have no idea what  is going on on the surface of mars. 




 If(when? I have faith!) Musk can get humans to mars I guarantee NASA will at least be able to get a couple satellites there by then.  




 Atlanta, the only place I have ever been rear ended and gotten a little sorry wave from the driver who proceeded to then just drive away. Granted it was in bumper to bumper  traffic on 75/85 at less than 5 mph and there was no structural damage but still what the fuck.  




 For example if I posted a comment which netted me 53 karma right before I went to bed, when I load up reddit the next day I would see a green (+53) next to my current comment karma in the display at the top of each reddit page. If it was -53, it would be red. Same deal with each refresh.

Not sure if this would be possible but I figure you could maybe store the current karma client-side at each page load and then do a quick calculation to see how it has changed. If reddit's fuzzing algorithm would mess up the small increments of 1 or 2 comment karma maybe just make it so it only happens if a sizable karma change is detected. 




 Not to mention we are just now starting the 'biological revolution', what with understanding (kind of) how genetics works and with the abilities to interface machines and our bodies. At least as a biomedical engineer with research experience in bioinformatics and computational genomics I think that this will be the next digital revolution and right now we can't even comprehend what will be possible in the next few decades in this field. Kind of like how many people in the 60s and 70s could not possibly have fathomed the smartphone I am using to communicate to people halfway across the world right now. 




  All their children, who were 7/8ths white

I assume you mean Thomas Jefferson's children's (from the slave) children? Even then wouldn't that be 3/4ths though unless the slave was only 1/2 black as well? Just confused where the 7/8ths came from.

 




 Not sure if it's the same everywhere but in America we call it 'grounding' not 'earthing'. Somewhat pedantic but just wanted to let you know in case you're not a native speaker. If I'm wrong and this is the correct UK terminology ignore this post.  




 He meant "boy" as in friend, not "boy" as in son just to clear that up for you. 




 Power through the gore in GoT, its worth it for sure and maybe you can take solace in the fact that its just acting and special effects, although that doesn't really help me sometimes. It, along with House of Cards, is in a whole other league than any other shows when it comes to TV series quality.  




 Why not couple a parachute with thrusters to achieve zero velocity on landing and make the trajectory somewhat predictable? 




 Yeah I'd say its by far easier to adjust the barge than the rocket 




 Good point, if you can land on a not quite stationary barge in the middle of an ocean you can do a land landing with ease. It's a test of sorts and lets them tweak the process to ensure the safety of landing that are near cities and populated areas. 




 What if you drained the "ball pit" and had some sort mechanism to either move the rocket to a launch pad nearby or made the ball pit the launchpad and elevated the bottom to ground level before relaunch? 









 Out of curiosity how to they plan to land it on land eventually? Different orbit trajectory or launch site or both? Or is this info privy to only Elon Musk and his team.

 What? You don't necessarily need a soft landing on a stable surface, you just need a landing where you don't break a lot of shit. That means either slowing the first stage down to 2m/s as the plan is now, or /u/clarkclarks's idea where you distribute the impact over a longer period of time and thus have less impact stress on the landing. It's not a bad idea although I'd be surprised if the people at SpaceX hadn't thought of it and ruled it out for some reason. 




 No plan survives contact with the enemy? 




 Here's a link to start at the right time just to make life a little easier for those lazy shits like me.

 I haven't watched the video since yesterday, so I might be wrong but doesn't he run immediately through the door to the right? 




 As others have said the plan was probably to have two people enter. That guy was the first and would have moved along the wall towards the right side of the room. A second person would enter and move along the wall towards the left. This is to establish tactical dominance and multiple lines of fire. This obviously fell apart when the officers encountered immediate fire and a clear line of sight to the fucking human piece of shit terrorist. This was the outcome. 




 Zojack Quasith 









 I'd say phase I and II are the biggest hurdles and where most treatments get weeded out, so I'd say there's a definite possibility this gets approved. Good to hear. 




 Before any type of treatment can be made widely available, it's efficacy and safety must be proved. This process occurs through the following phases and can take years or even decades:

* Phase I: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.

* Phase II: The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.

* Phase III: The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.

* Phase IV: Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. 

I'm not exactly sure what phase this trial was, but it is either I or II and although it looks promising the long term effects simply are not definitively known yet. This treatment is especially extreme, very expensive and taxing on the body. It would be highly irresponsible to start treating a large population of patients with something that has not been proven safe or effective yet. Like you mentioned, there is a high probability that this "miracle cure" doesn't pan out for whatever reason and if this is because of serious health side effects, you want to find that out before you give it to a bunch of people who are not in immediate life-threatening danger. Unfortunately this is just how science and medicine work and sometimes it seems pretty callous. Maybe you can take solace in the fact that others may not have to suffer the way your cousin did due to treatments like this one. 




 For sure. I'm not quite finished yet, I read ~240 pgs in just two sittings. I've got a degree in engineering and the science is incredibly accurate as far as I can tell too. Overall amazing book.

Edit: Removed spoiler just in case. Sorry I hope I didn't ruin the book for anyone, didn't even think about it!
 




 Just curious, how does this relate to chiropracty? 




 Agreed. I now know to make a farm on Mars with a little bit of earth dirt and my own shit.
