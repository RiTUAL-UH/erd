 Start researching the place you're going, what you will want to do there, and always keep in mind what season you will be traveling in. At first do a lot of general research and then do the nitty gritty: how are you going to get to point A to B, B to C, etc.? Food expenses? If you choose to travel with a tour group, hotel costs and meals may be included. Try looking up various routes to your destination via different airports in your area. Sometimes, this can save you a lot of money. Borrow luggage from someone to also save money... And lastly, consider a companion   a great camera.
