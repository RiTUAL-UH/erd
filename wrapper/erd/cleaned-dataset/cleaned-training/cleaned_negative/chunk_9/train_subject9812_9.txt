 Thanks. This game is so huge, though, that I wouldn't even know how to level through cata and mop. Are there certain areas to go to? Does cata and mop leveling just blend with the rest of the game? 




 Yeah, sorry about the broad question. Having not played in so long, I couldn't think of any questions that were more specific. But, thanks for the reply.
