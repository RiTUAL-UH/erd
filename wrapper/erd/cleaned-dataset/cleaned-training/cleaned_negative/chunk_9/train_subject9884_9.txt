 I think everybody does. Personally I can't say I'm that dedicated. However I truly believe that very few women deserve this kind of man. 

I mean you need to bring something to the table so that this man considers you worth this effort. That is something many women don't get. They think they deserve this treatment because they are a woman.  









 Phew!  




 Haven't looked at it yet. Is the finger being cut off with it?  




 ? 




 I never heard anybody complain about people saying: I really really like Japanese people. But as soon as somebody says they dislike Japanese people you get called a racists. 

Obviously every race (or more specifically, every culture) has certain characteristics. It should be find to dislike these characteristics the same way it is OK to like them.

Edit: I'm not a racists though ;) 









 Guys, reboot. 




 And yes, I can see that for 4 pieces, the price is decreasing again.  














 Doesn't work. I read somewhere that when you flash the lollipop rom, you lose your custom recovery. not sure where I read that though. 

If you power on with vol up pressed, it just restarts. 




 Never said it was. It is very pretty but boring as fuck.  




 I have the dual recovery installed. And I also flashed the first lollipop rom when it came out. 

Now I would like to flash the 5.02 ([this](http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/d5803-lollipop-5-02-odexed-pre-rooted-2-t3090505) one) but can't manage to get into the custom recovery. 

I read that I shall turn it on and wait for the green light to flash, but there is no green light. 

I feel stupid, but for the life of me, I don't know how to do it.  




 What an asshole. She will NEVER forgive him.  




 Would like to know that too. Can't get to the first saves on my porn account  




 I meant no offense, that is correct.  




 I'm starting today!  




 To be honest, I was not sure it qualifies. 

On the other hand it is never clear that what I wrote is even considered in the series. Like somebody else wrote. The series considers Skaara to be his son replacement. However I personally believe this is a good explanation of why the behave towards each other like they do.  




 Fair enough, but when she crawls to the windows as if she was raped, why does she think that is on tape but not when she put wine on her shirt?

Fair enough the movie is about the fact that people are overlooking things because they are biased. However, surely somebody would have looked at the video tapes. 

It makes no sense that she was able to manipulate the recordings.  




 Well, still strange that it is several days after the disappearance.  




 What's the problem with putting a sign up: This is free food. We are convinced it's good, but we can't guarantee. Your call.  




 Well, if I look at it from their perspective, all I see is:

Somebody gave you something so you won't starve, for free, and you fucked them up the ass. and you also fucked all the other people up the ass, who will no longer get free food. 

I would never do that. 




 Jack never got over the death of his son. Partly because he feels responsible for it but partly because he would like to be a dad. He is the perfect role model. He is aware of it because that is who he wants to be.

Daniel lost his parents when he was young and never got to learn from of look up to a male role model. He is a bit of a girl and he is also clumsy. 

When Jack meets Daniel, he sees a child - a kind but naive person. But he likes him

Daniel sees a military leader who does not care about morals or "the right thing to do". He does not understand Jack, just like a child does not understand grown ups. 

Over time they grow fond of each other and without ever realising it Jack becomes a father figure to Daniel and Daniel becomes a replacement for Jack's dead son. Daniel inspires Jack and turns him from being the cold soldier that he was into the best human being ever. 

Daniel on the other side only lives up to his full potential because of Jack. Daniel never realises that Jack always agrees with his morals. Jack often seems to be against Daniel's ideas. The reason is that Jack is able to see if something is a lost cause and instead of demoralising Daniel he takes the blame for not doing the morally right thing so that Daniel can stay who he is, just like a good father would. 

Jack protects Daniel like his own son. He wants him to grow, learn and eventually grow stronger and wiser than Jack himself. He is proud of Daniel and only like this is he able to sometimes forget that his actual son is dead. He gets to be a dad. 

Daniel, until very late, does not realise what an influence Jack has on him. He does not understand his motives and does not see that without Jack, he would have never been able to achieve what he achieved. He is always stubborn towards Jack because, just like a father, Jack is always in charge. However in the end you can feel Daniel's appreciation for Jack. 




 Be prepared for nightmares  




 Counter question:

What is the significance of this? I always wanted to know. Why does it matter? Is it because we should use the water more efficiently?  




 Not for a Surface 3 Pro docking station............................. 




 you could ask for a cold beer... 




 I would like to get this phone, but the backs look awful.  




 Ideally something like [this](https://image.rakuten.co.jp/byps/cabinet/sk/coach/cap_b15_coh_70692_kh.jpg?_ex=60x60) but in nice. 

Thank you! 




 Looks like it. I am glad.  




 I am surprised. 

Thank you! 




 looks like I was wrong. I'm surprised it seemed a lot shorter.  




 Nah, it was a Wembley Park Stadium. 




 It wasn't 5k that's for sure.  




 I like here maps, but I live in London and traffic is a nightmare in this city. Does HERE do a good job avoiding traffic like Waze does? 




 Sorry, I forgot. I have a 128GB SSD that is now in my laptop, but I will scrap the laptop.  




 

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I will mostly be using it for Lightroom and internet surfing.  

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I will be playing Diablo 3 and some older games. I am considering to buy a new shooter though. Is that going to be possible? 1080 is fine for me.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I want to see if I can get this done with less than 300 quid. It is more of a project. I don't actually need a new PC. My laptop can just about handle Diablo 3. But I would really like to build my first own PC. 

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

UK

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

All I know is it will be with the Intel Xeon X5650 because I got that from a guy who got it from work. I already bought it with the intention of building a PC. 

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

The most important thing is that it will last me a few years. 

Many thanks in advance.

 




 Thanks.  




 I don't know. I feel like you will be doing stuff you did not want to do all the time. 




 what exactly did you do? 




 You know what the most frustrating thing is? People will rea this post, agree and nothing will change. But I like that you took the time to post it because I might be wrong and you might have changed some people. 

Never give up 




 Every time I want cash I get my onscreen balance. 









 I never buy bottled water or anything in plastic bottles for that matter. Too much rubbish.  



















 It's strange. I would describe myself as two faced (or multi faced if you want). I behave very differently around different people. I still express the same opinions and beliefs and I am not a shy guy with my mum and a womaniser around my friends. But my language changes, how comfortable I am and how much I open up (other things too). I know everybody does this to a certain extent but I feel I do it more than others. I actually don't think there is anything wrong with that. 

My star sign is Gemini and I believe that is part of why I am how I am.  




 You dislike comments on reddit I take it?  




 Got to love England  




 Got to love London  




 Men farting in the men's room. I hate it. Judging by what I regularly hear at work, loads of my colleagues should def think about their diet  




 I seriously love this. Best pic I have seen here in a while and there are a lot of awesome shots. 

I am sure BW is best for this. But do you have a colour picture? 









 Can I ask what the difference is for using greenify and powernap if you don't have xposed?  




 Fair enough. Thanks 




 OK.  




 I did miss most of what you wrote. I got that ultra was sincere about saving humanity. This is why I was wondering about Fury's statement. How would he K ow all of what you have written above. 

But honestly, this all goes way over my head. I had a lot of trouble following the movie. I am not a huge fan and I find that the way things are connected is so complicated by now. 

Anyway, thanks for sharing.  




 And also, I hated the movie. I left before it was over. 




 When he appears on the farm he starts lecturing the Avengers about what Ultron's plans are. 

How would he know? The Avengers are the only ones who talked to Ultron, and I am pretty sure Fury can't just search the net for Ultron's plans. 

Also, I am not entirely sure but at that point I find it still 100% believable that Ultron only wants to eliminate the Avengers to protect earth. So why does Fury say he wants to kill everybody? 




 I think I'll try this 




 I think I'll try this 




 I think I'll try this.  




 Thank you. I think I'll go with a single cable  




 I'm in the UK but thanks  




 Hey, I bought this cable

http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00EI41K26/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8 qid=1432638653 sr=1 keywords=surface+hdmi

but the picture I got was really bad (I think the cable was just faulty (about 30% of pixels looked weird)

Which cable do you recommend to connect my surface to a monitor? 




 Same here.  









 No, same thing.  




 The PC does not actually work currently and I am trying to find a way to install Windows 7. However even if I manage to do that the machine might just be too old. 

I was wondering if there is any point using some of the parts and rebuilding a new PC based on them.

 




 After installing windows 7 it boots up to the point where you see the wallpaper and then nothing. My friendsaid its a driver issue. He said I should install windows with drivers already intergated. However I do not have that recovery CD anymore 




 It came with Windows XP Media Centre Edition 2005. When I got it nothing worked. I do not have a recovery CD. I have tried several times to install windows XP and Windows 7 but it always fails to boot afterwards. 

If possible at all, I would love to run Windows 7 on it and just use it for the living room. I only need to HDMI to work. 

Any help would be much appreciated. 

Is there any chance I could sell this somewhere? 




 What can I actually do to be informed or influence this?  




 I should always think first  




 I understand you guys. Just because someone creates and opportunity he should not have his bike stolen. Agreed. I am 100% on your side. I would love a world where I can just leave my bike on the street k owing nobody will touch it. It would be brilliant. 

But that is not the world we live in. That is a shame but it's the truth and this guy knows it. Otherwise he would not have bought two locks. 

It is a fact though that he did not get the most out of the locks he had and that is all I am saying. I am not blaming him for having his bike stolen. But if he would have been a little smarter he would only be missing one wheel.  




 Yeah, you're right. It is, but I want to believe that he is taking the piss because I would find that funny.  




 Exactly  




 Fuck me? Fuck you! When did I say he deserves it. If he is in an area where he is worried his wheels might get stolen and he is not smart enough to lock the frame as well, then it's his fault.  




 He wanted to protect his wheels and protect his wheels he did. 









 I feel like some of the things I find on here, I find very reasonable actually. His English is not great but I really think this is quite funny.  




 Not if you write dates in a way that makes sense. 

M/D/Y is just stupid.  




 I never had to work this hard for anything. 




 So he is actually especially stupid for trying to bury with water? 




 Music is awesome.  




 Don't want to lose root. 

Sorry I should have said 




 Why does this start a debate?  




 Not that I know of, but I use Whatsapp and never had any problem whatsoever. What is the problem you are having?
 




 I can't find the update app either to disable notifications for the update  




 Thank you. I always wonder why people seem to still use SMS and mms. I don't use either, ever 









 I really do not understand your questions 




 Read the whole thing and THEN saw its the onion... 

 




 Do it for 2 weeks. That won't cost you anything. If you don't get addicted after 2 weeks I'll apologise deeply to you. As soon as you feel your body change you will not stop. Just try you have nothing to lose. I use to be chubby. Working out was the best decision of my life.  




 They might have. I would point that out though. His target audience should know the difference.  




 I really don't want to get it wrong but what matters is not how many calories they eat in each study but whether or not they understand that every person has a different TDEE and that 2000 kcal (or however many) for some people will mean weight loss and for some weight gain. 

Now that would still be OK if the same group would do both trials but the people in the group probably  vary too.  









 No, they should have worked out the actual energy consumption of each individual in the group and then have them consume for example x - 500kcal per day each. For one group in 2 meals and for one group in 7 meals. Then you get a result.  




 I haven't finished reading but it starts out with one group eats 2000 kcal in 2 meals and one in 7 meals. So what?! If it's not the same person what does that even tell me? What do I know about the energy consumption of each of the people in the group? 

Edit: just read a bit more. Even though I do not have in depth knowledge on the subject I can tell that this article is worthless. The research he is talking about is not referenced, he misinterprets and does not know the basics. 

Edit 2: oops, he does reference. Soz 




 Really boring. How's the protagonist?  




 Came here to say: "not the worst thing Cameron has ever suggested" but you are absolutely right.  




 So you can go through your saved ones in a year and say: "I knew I wasn't going to..."  




 Do this and just eat less.

 There is no excuse. No matter your level you'll find the right exercise. It takes less than 45 minutes 3 times a week. If you're a beginner you can do all of it at home.

 Thank you 




 I really need to see it go back down. Fuck this gif.  




 But that makes no sense. It is not moving from location to location (I think we can all agree on that) but it's is moving through time really quickly. So my my point of view, the faster the machine goes, the slower the time traveller should appear. But it should still be visible.  




 I like this idea. Makes sense to me  




 Fair point.  









 Took this whilst I was on this:

Steepest cogwheel train in the world.  









 Was just about to go to bed... 

Well...  




 I don't know. I count at least 20 people. Let's see:

If half of them want it warm, thats 30 seconds just for that plus let's say another 30 seconds for being served = 10 minutes

Let's say the other 10 people get served and pay cash in the time the other 10 get their sandwich heated up = +0 minutes.

I am sure at least 5 of them will have a coffee as well. I am sure this adds at least 5 minutes. 

I'll say it takes at least 15 minutes. 

Edit: Ok, just saw that you wrote it looks like MORE than a 5 min queue. I that you said looks more like a 5 min queue. Forget it. 




 Does anybody have experience with the myprotein ready meals? Is the quality acceptable? Does it taste OK?  




 Oh, did not get that.  




 It is true what you say. Child molestation is never funny. But why do you think that he thinks it is funny? He's telling a story about how the 70s were different and how even child molesters were kind of accepted back then. And he makes a joke about that to point out how outrageous that actually is. 

Then he point out how absolutely insane these people are by stating that their desire for "a young boy" is stronger than their desire for freedom and general acceptance in society. He tells us that they are sick but he does it with jokes. 

I see nothing wrong with this. 

Edit: I didn't get that op was being sarcastic. Sorry...
