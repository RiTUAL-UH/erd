 After 25 years of explaining stuff to patients and families with an average 3rd grade reading comprehension oversimplifications and colloquialisms creep into one's language. The Quality Assurance Board would likely find your complaint to have little merit, they focus their efforts on slightly more egregious mistakes.

In other words, come at me bro.

 I am a hospitalist but procedures became so infrequent I quit doing them. If someone codes the ED doc or anesthesia intubates. With patients increasingly well-nourished intubation is getting trickier, in hospital a glidescope is always available. I have always appreciated the skills of EMTs in securing the airway under difficult circumstances-kudos all 'round. 




 Is tomahawk face-to-face? Do you carry a glidescope on your rig, do you ever resort to a laryngeal mask?

 Depends on the case. A 90+ year old who's decided it's time to go and dies, that's part of the show and doesn't bug me. But the 25 year old heroin addict with blown aortic and mitral valves, set for surgery the next day, who I coded for 40 minutes to no avail (and parents were sobbing in the corner of the room), or the 19 year old college student with viral myocarditis and heart failure whose last words are "I want to talk to my mom" before intubation, and who codes and dies later that night-you never, ever forget. 




 I've done hospital medicine on and off since '97, also traditional IM (in and outpt) and all outpt. Used to start on Friday afternoon as a hospitalist and finish the following Friday with one night (Monday) off for uninterrupted rest, and still had to review labs, answer phone calls, refill rx for my outpatients. Now I just do Hospital medicine.  Seven on, seven off; 12h (about) shifts and every 3 months get three weeks in a row off. 

The practice of acute care/hospital medicine is more interesting and rewarding; the pay is good and I get to do teaching. I've given up on procedures, just wasn't getting enough volume to stay proficient.

I like my job. It's not perfect, there's plenty of stress and consultants can be jerks, but overall it's very rewarding. I'd do it again if I had to start over.
