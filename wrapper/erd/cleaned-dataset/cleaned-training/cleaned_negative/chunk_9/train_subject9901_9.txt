 When people say "It's only a game." 




 I always release the ones i dont want, and i make a habit of only putting pokemon above lvl 25 into the system. 




 I know how you feel, I just got my first paycheck from my first job. The lack of ambition I have had for a couple years is finally gone and I can do things. Life is looking up for us both!!
