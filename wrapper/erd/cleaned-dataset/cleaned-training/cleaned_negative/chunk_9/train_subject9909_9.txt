 What if there was an MMO where there were only one of a few very powerful things and whoever controlled them could do amazing things. Can you imagine the stories? If I was that company, I would create a position for people to just follow the objects an make sure nobody collects more than one.

What if the MMO started with only a few people, in a real room. Then they chose from the objects by way of riddles which belied their power. The rest of the objects then get scattered about the world... into rivers, caves, temples, and to the tops of mountains and the guts of beasts.

 I have a different/concordant theory. I have a coconut allergy and get a rash that looks like the keto rash if I ingest coconut protein. I think people who go keto are trying new protein sources and experience allergic reactions to some. Some people get over the allergy, because oral ingestion will sometimes do that, and not have the problem again.

Since there is no scientific studies yet, we don't know. Both make sense to me because adipose tissue stores a lot more than fat and releasing it fast can't be easy.

 Hijacking top comment to let y'all know Morales gave the Pope the cross and necklace as propaganda to reinforce his socialist government. This picture of a smiling pope is what his people will see, they will never hear that the Pope then said "That isn't right" and refused the gifts. This polite smile didn't last long. The Pope couldn't fucking even, either.

I usually wouldn't hijack, but, you know... state propaganda. 




 By charity and opportunity. In the evolving market, new players will always come to the front if they have the means to. Accidents, family tragedies, and malinvestments happen which can unseat even the most leading businesses and organizations.

Being fair is one thing, but being personally generous is what would make an economy fall into the definition of distributist. The effort to make life easy for your neighbor - to follow the golden rule. 




 Slavery was a little different to the immediate people he was addressing. It was more like voluntary slavery, which you can find Ancaps defending and theorizing from time to time. I bet there are threads if you search.

True, not every slave was in that position as debt but as war-prize or outright slave. I think the regional Jewish state restricted that practice, however. Rome definitely had thousands of galley-slaves. 




 yah, and he gave it back as well. 




 He said "That's not right" when he saw the cross. He then refused it and checked the necklace - which he also gave back. 




 And to fix it we need to... disregard the law...

hmmm 




 I guess I'm trying to get away from "whose fault is it?"

People experience incentivized and naturally attractive options; also disincentivized and naturally poor options. I think we are in a situation where different forces have disincentivized the general population from both simply choosing to eat healthier and doing the research to find out what they think might be very healthy eating.

The government may be some of those forces (and the federal overreach enables that), but there are cascading forces off of that - and even more important - there are forces which influenced government in the first place.

Government is a tool for lobbyists. I blame capture on narcisistic scientists and irresponsible corporations. Like take a look at the McGovern report. The government got behind fringe ideas even though strong opposition was there from the scientific community. There is nothing more dangerous than a narcisistic scientist with an idea that a major industry can use to control mass populations.

 Other luminaries include Allan Savory and Mark Shepard. I've seen that Bill Mollison understood most of what these men practice now and Geoff Lawton helps spread news about and teach people.

We can feed the world, but it will mean making farms more labor-intensive. That isn't a bad thing, because done correctly it is healthy and fulfilling work, but people are used to seeing robotic harvesters raoming across the plains scooping up grains. Raising a head of cattle will take much less land and water and almost only the land the herd grazes on will be included in the process. No more taking into consideration the roads between the grains in Iowa and the industrial ranches in Colorado or the water rights in Nevada for the farm in California. With more people on the land those dying midwest towns will liven up, increasing opportunity and prosperity. The deserts of the Southwest can be restored through management by slowing down the water that currently flash-floods away.

How much more valuable would the land we currently till for corn be if it didn't take so many material inputs? How much more affordable would meat and whole food be if it was produced by many more people rather than a few strings of corporate farms? 




 Yet at each level of education and attention being paid, there is misinformation and confusion.

There are competing consensuses right now. Fighting dietary guidlines, fad diets, and "fad diets" that have stuck around and become "alternative diets." Unless each person individually sits down and reads a sizeable amount of literature there has to be some bridge of trust - the field of which looks like chutes and ladders right now. 




  the incentives are so huge they have altered our systems of food service and commercial environments.

It didn't take that long for people to leave fats behind. If the governmental support for trash foods gets decimated society will change again. 




 Subsidies have to be eliminated and industrial meat production should be eliminated in exchange for increased mob grazing on managed, restored, grassland.

There is a large incentive to eat tons of carbs which outweighs the health concerns many times because the incentives are so huge they have altered out systems of food service and commercial environments. Racks of chips and soft drinks are EVERYWHERE and that is both part of the culture problem and a result of the corruption problem. 




 News is reporting he took the necklace off, as well. 




 News is coming out he rejected the gift and similar necklace. 




 It isn't a cigarette. Do you alrady smoke cigars and inhale or are you asking why people don't?

 The game or the store? 




 Progressive government programs are generally an attempt at equal outcomes. Of course, how can a government manage an economy down to the individual? It cannot; so some idiot thought it would be just fine to try and make people equal by dividing them by demographics. Gender, age, wealth, ethnicity. To do so is institutionalizing discrimination and directly impinges free opportunity.

"But!" They will say, "The ---- people have more of these jobs than the ---- people. That isn't fair!"

Why are they acting like those people are different? To get votes from one or the other. Or out of an incorrect sense of justice which relies on discriminating against successful people by seeing their succsess as dependent on institutionalized force... but then why use more institutionalized force instead of just removing what those people were supposedly using? It is like gaining the One Ring and thinking you can control it, when it will really just enslave you.

(which is apparently along the lines of what JRR Tolkein was writing about. Anarchy and Christianity.) 




 Hey! I remember when it was called "Cranberry Mall" and had a Babbage's. There have been a few gamer-oriented stores in the past few years. I got a link to [Save Point's](http://savepointmd.com/) website off the directory.

 Being from Senegal *in particular* does not mean anything to his argument. The fact that health inspectors were unaware of why the code was the way it was and maybe that it should be changed was important. They also, like everyone else, did not understand or care how hard it was to do business and what businesses contributed to the community. Both because they were not part of the community and because they were not culturally assimilated. The majority of these immigrants will one day look back and think they might have been too hard on many places they went to.

The other people had a different problem. Straight anti-business attitudes are from stupidity and misplaced elitism. These jerks are masters of the social bubble and will clip their incoming information so that they stay willfully ignorant of the problems they are causing unless an event pops the bubble... and then its even money between them coming around to more conservative attitudes or going full commie. 




 Great WWII movie, by the way. 




 Western European culture has historically toed this line in many ways which evolved into crossing the line. Once people were tempted to defeat the spirit of chastity in each practice it eventually became the norm and progressed from there, again.

Germanic cultures have used a board placed between two young adults sleeping in the same bed to test for marital compatibility. Sometimes there was even a chaperone involved, sitting there in the bedroom.

Allowing young people to sleep together eventually became turning a blind eye to young men "coming through the window" (literally scaling the house and sleeping overnight in the young lady's bedroom) on their own daughters. I've heard it said that coming through the window was a practice which came from times when couples were betrothed but financially or politically unable to marry.

Chaperoning seems to be the most stable resolution to ameliorating temptation when dating. Never leave yourself alone with someone if there is a chance you could get really physical. That will only leave you wanting more. Been there.

 Sinarnu yelled at his ox-drivers around the heavy cart. "You sacks of vinegar!" Throwing his unencumbered hand in the air, he proceeded to point towards the correct dock. "My ships are at berth on the northern wharf! You waste my time and I'll make sure your masters flog you bloody!"

Standing to the side as the cart was more swiftly guided in the correct direction, Sinarnu hefted the box of metal under his arm. It was the most important piece and he didn't trust swine of men with it. It was a shame he had to endure these Bedu slaves - with their lowly foremen not much better. Taking a pace behind his most precious cargo, he tried to remember his own place as a well-connected merchant. He paid no mind to his personal slaves and entourage, which wafted the air near him with slightly scented palms and carried his necessary documents, impressed in kiln-dried clay.

As the cart wiled it's way through the dusty but cobbled streets to the edge of the wharfs, he spied Zannan coming down a sidestreet. A worthy merchant, he was no doubt coming to see what Sinarnu was taking to sea. The boy, Idadda, was also coming. He was coming to the age of twelve and six, fully grown and already accomplished. Their entourage and slaves combined were greater than his own, so Sinarnu pretended not to notice them approaching and hurried past the groaning, burlap covered cart to his waiting fleet. The cobble ended and slaves hurried even past the rushing merchant to identify mud and guide him around it.

The fishermen's fleet of the Aynen Row bordered Sinarnu's fleet and his slaves also took the duty of mustering a path through the men and women carrying baskets dripping brine and refuse on the dirt which sloped into the harbor of Ugarit. One woman, a transplanted Minoan who was customarily bare-breasted dropped her basket behind Sinarnu as he passed - causing his scribes and attendents to prance about, avoiding the catch sliding underfoot. Sinarnu noted the impression that might appear to Zannan, that hoity Hittite. He thought of a dismissive comment - just in case.

With his entourage picking themselves up behind the master - who looked very displeased - Captain Burnu tugged his oiled and curled goatee for luck and decided against smiling as the master came to the decking of the wharves. "We'll load the cargo immidiately."

Sinarnu stepped up, level with his dutiful employee, and sternly looked at him in a class-bridging evocation of contempt for his situation. "No, you'll have to wait until I entertain some friends..." Burnu looked to see Zannan and his son round the corner of another street and turn to walk up to them. There were a few minutes and he could see the oxen making good time through the moderate crowd and spilled fish (the Minoan woman still scrambling to gather the remaining, untrampled, fish). "We might be able to - " A wave of Sinarnu's free hand brought closure. "I have said." The key piece was handed over to Burnu, and Sinarnu confided: "Stow this now and act as if you have nothing to hide."

Burnu grabbed the metal and took it in stride. The master has his obligations, it would seem.

Sinarnu turned toward his approaching cart and kept the corner of his eye on the Hittite merchant. He also looked at the sky, seeing it was clear and blue with a weak and low sun for the late month. Comfortable and bright. The perfect atmosphere for gloating.

The behemoth load stopped at the deck's end, and Sinarnu clapped his hands for the foremen to take orders. Six swarthy Ugarits ambled off the cart and from the mass of livestock and resting slaves. "We are to beach the craft and lift the device by passing poles. Dispatch the beasts and assemble for the task!"

Now Zannan was upon the scene. Sinarnu was now among his strong and tanned sailors, who did odd jobs at the foot of the decking and carried things past - to and from the four ships. The Hittite was now evenly matched, at least in appearence of power. The best power - power over men.

"So you have a cargo, friend Sinarnu!" Zannan said in his brutal northern accent.

"I have a great cargo, friend Zannan. Welcome friend Idadda. You appear strong and fine. See my ships and men."

"Thank you friend Sinarnu, you do me honor. I have seen your ships and men and the wares you attempt to carry. We are all truly blessed in prosperity."

"The west does not see prosperity, though." Sinarnu added.

This puzzled the two Hittites slightly. Zannan asked, "How far west?"

"The blight was not yet upon Crete ere I last did hear."

Idadda replied "We are glad to know. The north is bitter but for the love of the Nile." Zannan nodded in agreement.

Frowning his own agreement to that statement, Sinarnu then smiled and raised a hand in a gesture of changing from news and pleasantries to the matters at hand. The air was open for Zannan to fill it.

"Please, I desire greatly to see what you have. I will give you a pair of tin ox-hides to know it."

Sinarnu chuckled, his tidy clothes concealing a jiggling belly. "Do so and I will show you. You will pay more to be told more."

"Done!" Zannan's eyes betrayed his sense of the importance he placed on new and dashing things. From knots and jointings to dances and spices - he was known for being a glut of information. The desire served him well in practical matters, but fed his soul even more. A scribe of his dashed across to organize the transaction.

A clap from the master and the eavesdropping foremen cut tethers on one side of the burlap cover, slaves pulling it to the ground. A shining contraption stood five feet tall off the bed of the cart. It was framed plainly but full of lines, plates, and spurs.

Zannan stood transfixed, a hand toussling his oiled locks. "You have a maze."

Idadda started to walk around the behemoth of oiled bronze and rubbed wood. "But not for amusement!" he politely called back to his father.

"A man of Babylon's great work." Sinarnu showed his open palm to Zannan. "Will you know what it works?"

"Yes, yes!" Called Idadda, clearly as enticed as his father. He was poking his nose up to the plates and sliding catches of the large machine, respectfully not touching but trying to absorb the complexity.

Zannan furrowed his brow with the upcoming wager for haggling information's price. Staring hard at the sea merchant above him on the decking, he shouted: "Two more tin ox-hides!"

"Done!" Sinarnu called out. Another scribe dashed about to manage the transfer. Sinarnu descended graciously, smiling at his needy competitor. Inside, he was armor-clad in knowing the knowledge would be of little use for the Hittite. Such a man simply did not have the conections, yet, to manage such an event. Strolling together, they circled the cart as the slaves and foremen stood back. "You see this outside of plates and beams, it carries the toothed plates inside. It makes sure the axles - like on wagons - do not move. This is a very special construction unlike we have seen before. I tell you the creator is a magician for what he makes metals do."

Idadda waited for them at the rear of the cart, having calmed down. "Father, there is a trough here for something."

Sinarnu waved a hand in an offer to have Zannan look closer. The Hittite ascended the cart wheel and looked deep into the... machine. "Tell me what goes in here, friend."

"The creature of purple dye." Zannan's eyes grew larger than his son's had. "And out comes the dye."

"I am afraid I have underpaid you... for this information." Zannan tried his most carefully to say as he eased himself to the ground. The dye of royals was immensely treasured. He did not want to be in debt to anyone - even an honorable Ugarit such as Sinarnu. "Please, let me - "

"You are in no need, friend." Sinarnu pretended to look ashamed in politeness. "I have concealed important information about the machine. It is not for sale but I can repeat that the man who built this is a magician." Sinarnu ushered his merchant colleagues away from the polished monstrosity. "Everything I have said is true and all you have seen is true. It is from the east and it is going to the west. It takes in the shellfish and dispenses the dye." He turned and pointed to the batch of his entourage responsible for refreshments and they readied a modestly transportable collection of foods and drinks.

Zannan watched the slaves cover the device back up in preparation for a sea voyage. "I hope to see one in motion."

Sinarnu thought of the metal box he had carried for miles from the trade roads outside Ugarit in confidence. He had opened it in the security of his own home - in the cellar. His cousin who made the journey said it was not magic but skill though some would not differentiate. The bronze spring inside was easily recognizeable as a work of immense value. Sinarnu did not know how it made the machine work. He knew more force was needed for operation, but it was still very alive in his hands as he regarded the power such a thing was capable of.

 It is a very brief article which focuses on historical life, not martial action. 




 I can't follow that up. Too damn glorious. Well done. 




 Or at least not cancel your ticket. But also, if you got to know pilots, stewards, or other frequent fliers I can imagine they'd invite you to their home field for dinner or a bed. And you could even save up enough for a vacation home in one or more far-flung continents. 




 There is a growing movement away from modern housing. The air-tight house is a failure. Costly, over-mechanized, and prone to maintenance. I grew up in a 200 year old stone house in Maryland and appreciated being able to open each window for a "chimney" effect where the air would come in the basement and get sucked up through the house by the air above it getting warmer - and then out through the attic. I am furious sometimes when I see what developers are building. 




 Probably because the areas are food-sufficient enough for resistance to not have been reliant on central government sponsorship. It is more in the culture than in the politics, possibly. I am wondering, not speaking from experience.

Nothing I have said *makes* people do anything, but it does let them know I disapprove. That isn't violence and it isn't force. 




 Am I forcing my morals or voicing my opinion just like you?

There is a comment box here, so I'm using it.

Forcing morals is serious stuff and I won't have any of it in government or in personal physical persecution, but social pressure is present in the form of voiced opinions and I feel responsible to let y'all know how I feel about this. You don't have to like it.

 It is asking less of people to run a business well in cooperation with others than to ask a government not to get in the way. The incentives are different and only beneficial to the private individual when he is in full control.

  peoples taxes (majority anyways) are paid through their employer. 

Exemptions can be requested... it would probably be rescinded after the first offense. That is why it would have to be coordinated. The government is made to act like it owns our money and lets us keep some. Overloading the system to the point where it will only operate if terribly simplified might be an avenue to correction.

The government is staffed by people and tied together by perception. One perception that keeps it aflaot is the perception that enforcers are doing the right thing (this is important within the ranks of enforcers and in the general citizenry, of course). Since this is usually incorrect at some level, administrators have two options to keep the perception alive. They can either walk back the control or lash out and justify actions later.

With the ranch, the government had made a mistake *somewhere,* so they had to stop the hardball. If I remember correctly, it was with not enforcing the arrangement more formally and immediately. Maybe it flew under the radar for a while before someone noticed - I don't recall. Nobody thinks FBI and LMB agents dieing over scrubland will solve anything. 




 Don't know, yet, but the most successful movements have been organized and although the theory of technique and process may have been public, the practical application was done in confidence.

I think people may stop paying taxes, or pay a flat amount voluntarily while ignoring government code. I think small and medium businesses may band together to ignore regulations and licenses set up by corporations to subdue them. I think property owners will start prohibiting federal authorities from accessing their property. 




 Indeed.

 It is interesting to note that at this abstract level neither theory precludes the industrial revolution from occurring without European colonization. simply later, more slowly, and/or somewhere else being in the forefront.

 If I was interested in the [MiniUSB Power Adapter with BDP ](http://smile.amazon.com/CELL-POWER-CPUSB01-Discharge-Prevention/dp/B00VLAEPJ0/ref=pd_bxgy_422_text_y), would [this product](http://smile.amazon.com/Littelfuse-FHA200BP-ATO-Add-A-Circuit-Kit/dp/B0002BGELQ/ref=pd_sim_422_2?ie=UTF8 refRID=04631KZW23911P4W2RKY) be what I needed to hardwire it into the fusebox? 




 Could have made it in 1952 and stamped it 1913 to fool people. 




 Doubly so since the Americans had extensive research in the war colleges on the Crimean War. My family has a book made by the observation detachment of reports and schematics of forts, equipment, and weapons. Everything from canteens to mortar barges. 




 May be a unit in the game, haven't played the mod, but it is a real thing.

 I do agree with that reasoning, but if there are people satisfied with a $100 cam then I have to consider that I may be as well. 




 He just skates off down a hill and the police detective he helps says to the closest person, "There he goes again, shredding more light on crime."

Sometimes it is a hot dog seller who doesn't look up to listen, but hands him his foil-wrapped meal, sometimes it is an officer, sometimes it is a hot chick. 




 Happy to bust some karma off ya, dude. Later days! 




 Could you give me some examples of what you consider reputable sources.

What you said is general, but also terribly basic. I'm asking here because I desire information specific to this class of product. 




 like... in Baltimore...

Vut they are very competent at rustling up major lawsuits without chasing noon o'clokckers. 




 Seriously, why are there so many shady dashcam dealers? I bet it is like this for all consumer electronics. I am dead tired of getting screwed by strangers online and on the road.

What brick and mortar chain stores carry dashcams?

Where do you buy from online for top-quality customer service?

What models should I stay away from and which brands should be more reliable?

Do you have a checklist for checking a dashcam when you get it?

Do models that cost more tend to be fakes/duds/lemons less often? 




 No, I've got that as well. It is a fluffy bit of chub that sits there and mocks you in the mirror. 




 "Shredding" light on issues makes me think of a radical skateboarding reporter that busts crime and corruption in a Californian city. 




 I do not believe in mathematics - I understand reason.

I believe in transubstantiation - it is a mystery. 




 NEVER NEED A REASON,

NEVER NEED A RHYME. 




 Not by itself, but I don't know how marriages would be recorded in these sates with no licensure. I wonder if there is an argument that each marriage acrries the full weight of catechism and would be permanent - as in no divorces. A Catholic marriage is only sacrement and living with someone for the rest of your life when the state is there taking up the legal ends.

The legal reasons for having a record of marriage is to protect each spouse and any children without any taxes to be accounted for. Churches have long provided this service, which these days provides a great deal of geneological assistance. 




 anyway, as a Catholic I recognize that the family structure is communal and yet it exists inside the wider structure of capitolism. Have any thoughts on that? 




 So you are opposed to the revolution, or just participating in rolling heads? 




 You are, however, comparing the supposedly inevitable revolution to the American civil war. Do you think violence is unavoidable, or natural and cyclic? 




 The thing is, how are you going to prove it works to convince people?

You cannot expect stable, reasonable, people to trust a system will be better without proof of the final result. Especially when the change will be complete and total.

You are saying that you can't even concieve of success if less than the entire world is transformed. Are you sure? Maybe a region or a medium sized country? (This is in the context of the reddit post, where there would hypothetically be no armed opposition, nor ideological opposition) Can you concieve of there being a placenta-like interface at the theoretical place where the two meet? Inside the geographical area, socialism with no property rights. Outside, anarchy with other socialist groups.

I think I know what you should say, though I'll tell you if you reply so I don't spoil it.

It sounds like you saying socialism has no way to protect from anti-social elements, or are you conceding that socialism is not good enough to prove itself in the face of no opposition.
