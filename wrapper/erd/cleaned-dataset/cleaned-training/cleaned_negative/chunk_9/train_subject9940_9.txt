 We had done some things. We went to some movies and spent a day at the beach together with her friends. We cuddled a few times, and kissed a few times. In the span of about a month and a half. I wanted to do more with her, to really become something more than friends, but I was so afraid to do anything that the relationship faded. She told me that she didn't think I was ready for a serious relationship. Honestly, I feel like I am, but my damned SAD is stopped me from doing as much as I wanted to do with her. I feel like this really could have been a great thing if it wasn't for my anxiety. It really sucks.
