 No Goblin Techies though :( 




 To preface this, I have no problem with foreigners queuing for US servers if they can speak English. But if you can't speak English, you shouldn't be allowed to queue for US servers. Because once again I'm playing ranked captain's draft tonight and all but one of my teammates speaks English, and guess which one immediately steals captain? Yep. And then proceeds to pick a team that none of us want, and go 0-20 intentionally feeding the entire time while buying couriers and sending them into the enemy. 

Something needs to be done. Reporting doesn't do anything permanent, they'll be back in ranked doing it again in 5 games. An idea I saw in some other thread was a kind of flag where if a person is queuing for US servers but can't speak English, you get enough people to flag them and they can't queue for US servers any more. I fully support this idea. In a team-based game such as DOTA you really do need all 5 people being able to communicate and work together. I've met more than my fair share of Russians, Hispanics, Germans, etc. who come to US servers simply to troll and ruin games for us. And if people try to flag English speakers, whether they're trolling or butthurt or for whatever reason, I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to ask a few basic English questions to prove you can read/speak/write it.

What if reddit designed some sort of petition and submitted it to Valve? Or something. We talk all day about wanting something done, would it be possible to actually get the ball rolling here and try to get this fixed? This isn't just another circle jerk complaint thread, but if anyone is actually interested in coming up with a solution and trying to get it implemented I'm fully for it and will support in any way I can.

 









 Randomly three hours ago I went from being able to play fine to having a good two second lag in everything in the entire game. I usually queue for US East/West servers, but even tried a Europe East/West one and it was the exact same. Nothing changed on my computer, and nobody else is using my internet.

Anyone else experiencing horrid lag tonight?

 Also if anyone has links to articles explaining what's going on over there like I'm five, that would be much appreciated. I've tried to read some things but honestly it just confuses me.

 I'm considering a career in Audio Engineering to help my electronic music production passion and was wondering if there were any on here that would be able to give me a quick run down on what you actually do and can do with the information and degree earned from a major in Audio Engineering. 

I don't know if this is related, but if I want to work with speakers and setting up audio/visual music and light shows and etc., what would that be? 

Thanks guys. 

















































 A couple friends and I were thinking about starting a business down the road, and one of the things I was thinking I could help out with was marketing for it, but really have no idea what it's like. 

What are the kinds of classes that go along with that major?

What kind of job work would I be doing in the future? If this would vary from company to company, is there any kind of guideline or across the board generalization of it?

Is the job market good for people with this degree? As in is someone with this degree a sought after person for companies and businesses?

If our idea falls through, is this degree something I'll be able to fall back on in the future? 

These questions may be kind of vague, and I apologize if they are, but any help at all is much appreciated :)

 Me and some friends are debating on whether or not to drive to Chicago this weekend for Skream and Benga, and I was wondering what their shows have been like recently? I remember a video from not too long ago of people complaining they were starting to play "brostep" at their shows and was curious if it would be worth it still. Are they playing tunes from their early days where each set was an absolute banger or are they playing mostly their new stuff which I personally am not too big a fan of? Thanks in advance.

edit: [This](http://www.clubtix.com/images/event/full/1601_image_1.jpg) is the event page and line-up for the night, we're all mostly going for Feed Me but wanted to know if Skream and Benga would be worth the trip too.

 Basically it was Friday, their last day of school before winter break. She's 16 and she left after 2nd bell to go to a friend's house and get drunk. She was expecting to be back to school in time to catch the bus, but ended up getting really sick and got into an argument with her mom about not being home, resulting in her mom telling her NOT to come home, and that she doesn't want to "see her face again". So she stayed overnight at this friend's house, and went to another friend's house the next day to stay. Her parents are divorced, and apparently right now she is en route to her dad's while her mom is talking to the police about "pressing charges" for truancy and being a runaway.

What I'm wondering is, what are the possible outcomes? If you're a runaway, I believe the police just take you back home right? If you're a truant, if all they do is hear about it, and don't catch you in the act, I'm assuming the only thing they will do is tell the school and let the school handle it, correct? And her mom currently doesn't know she was out drinking, but apparently an ex-boyfriend who heard about all this is spilling the beans to her mom and may tell her, so if the police find out about underage drinking what would result of that? And is the friend she drank with and stayed with, who is about to turn 18, in any danger of punishment? 

Any help is very appreciated.

 Mine would be the yell Eminem does in "Just Lose It", for the lols. 




 Mt. Washington here :) 




 Mine personally was through rage comics and hearing about f7u12.  



















 Here is the link: http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/marijuana

Some things I would like to point out to potential readers: 

"In 2009, marijuana was involved in 376,000 emergency department visits nationwide." Check the link, our own government doesn't even know how to properly site sources. The link doesn't even mention the word Marijuana anywhere in it. "Drug related" does not mean strictly marijuana. 

"And the science, though still evolving in terms of long-term consequences of marijuana use, is clear: marijuana use is associated with addiction, respiratory and mental illness, poor motor performance, and cognitive impairment, among other negative effects." Their source on this one is valid. However http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_myth9.shtml has legitimate research stating otherwise. An interesting thing I've noticed: the government always quotes "science" or "scientists". They have their funded websites saying everything the drug does to you and how it works and how bad it is. But in textbooks and every pro-marijuana website out there, actual college studies and experiments are sited. Ones that result in favor of the pro-marijuana side. Just thought that was funny, that even though the "science" favors one side, actual real-life tests with real-life humans prove otherwise. I encourage you to read the other 13 myths they bust. They site every study and source too. 

"Furthermore, the Administration opposes drug legalization.  Legalization threatens public health by increasing availability of drugs and undermining prevention activities." Alcohol is legal. Nicotine is legal. Nicotine is a drug. Alcohol is a drug. It is possible to overdose on alcohol, and it happens every day, and impossible to overdose on marijuana. Millions of people die each year from these two drugs that are perfectly legal to consume if you are of age. I'm not saying there are no marijuana related deaths, but if the government tries to say they oppose drug legalization, they can not turn a blind eye to the things that kill Americans every day. Potentially fatal drugs are even prescribed to people; drugs like Vicodin, Percocet or Morphine. 

Does anyone else see this as an outrage or is it just me? The government and anti-drug agencies endorse half-truths and force opinions based on pure bullshit or skewed facts. 

Maybe this is just a rant from a sad ent, but I would love to see the day when people told the facts. Even if it meant their position was compromised. The fact that it was only a click or two away from our petition is what really frazzled me. 

I will support the petition wholly, and I hope all you fellow ents will do the same. Marijuana will be legal, or at least decriminalized, some day. I'm awaiting it eagerly :)

TL;DR: Mad ent rants about government's stance on marijuana. 














 Something along these lines: At a set time during the day, but not too often to make it annoying, have the image of a small bug slowly walk across the screen and see how many people you can trick into thinking its a real bug.

 r/dota2 apparently doesn't have a sense of humor. 




 And actually it completely counts. If that had been ranked, you would have lost MMR because of that game. And intentional feeders are far more prevalent in lower "trenches" than above 4 or 5k. 

If I play 10 games in a day in the high 2k/low 3k bracket, it's almost a 100% chance that I will lose 1 or more games due to a feeder, whether it be intentional from the start or feeding from lack of skill, effort or giving up for a multitude of different reasons.

And to take a lighthearted jab at you in jest, I've won games with an intentional feeder on my team. If you're so good, why couldn't you? Just saying. 




 I don't think people above 4k actually realize how the 2k bracket works.

If you're playing a carry and you're farming, 70% of the time you will be flamed for not participating in the minute 10 team fights your team is stupidly engaging in, 50% of the time resulting in a teammate giving up and playing even worse.

If you're playing mid and you don't gank side lanes immediately upon hitting level 6, especially if a sidelaner dies once, 60% of the time you will be flamed and that member will give up.

If you're supporting and your carry dies you get flamed, even if its a 2v3 engagement and it was his stupidity that got him killed, and he gives up.

From what I've read, yes this happens above 4 and 5k, but it happens FAR more often in lower "trenches". I would actually bet money and highly doubt a 5k could take my account and win 10 games in a row just based on the fact that if you don't play like your teammates think you should, they give up and it basically becomes 4v6 or even worse 3v7, because the member(s) that stopped trying are essentially dead weight and benefiting the opposing team more than your own. 

 




 You're fine. What is your MMR, just curious?

Also dotabuff for that game, because it's easy to lie over the internet ;)

Graduated in 2012. I can't find the source, but IIRC we were ranked #36 in the country in academic level for public high schools. We were the #1 high school, both private and public, in Ohio.

To graduate with Honors you had to meet 7 out of 8 requirements. The only requirement that I didn't meet was GPA. Examples of other requirements were a passing grade in Physics AA or higher (passed AA with a D) and Calculus AA or higher (passed AA with a D), and certain amounts of other credits (for example I took Photography and Digital Imaging for an extra Fine Arts credit).

I found out three days before graduation that I was graduating. And with Honors! My senior year I was less than 10 recorded absences away from failing the entire year. 

 




 Just tried to find a match for the first time today, spent 10 minutes looking for a server.

Are they fucked again? 




 I bet you play on US East. 




 Yeah it's either AJ or Whitworth, as said below. But neither of them really have any misconceptions. 

Honorable mention to Kevin Huber, top 3 punter in the league. 




 Reply to this comment so I see it 




 Do it then. 1 person doesn't win a game. If so, if you calibrated to 3k then you would win every single match until you got back up to whatever MMR you are now.

Do it if you're so confident.  




 I'm already the best person on my team every game. And in most games, the whole lobby.  




 I played as Sniper with a pocket Omni yesterday. It was essentially 3v5 because the Slark fed and Huskar got butthurt that Omni prioritized me over him (Huskar was pretty garbage) and spent the rest of the game afk farming instead of helping team fight. 

We actually would have completely won if Huskar hadn't have given up. DP pops ult, Husk and I both ult her, dead DP, no push. They had one or two lanes of racks at 30 minutes, and me and pocket Omni were staving off their final pushes every time, but as I was maybe 500 gold from a Rapier (which probably could have won us the game) I finally died, had to buy back and they took the final racks. Sniper and SF are both incredibly overpowered right now.

http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1320883650 




 My volume was up much too high for that.

RIP ears. 




  they must be doing something else better than you that allows them to win games and get to that MMR.

Yeah their team probably carried them to their wins. I'm at 3k and I'm consistently top 2 best players in the lobby. The ONLY thing that keeps me from winning every game is the rest of my team. If I'm mid, my side lanes feed. If I don't play mid, the mid loses and their SF goes 18-0 and we lose in 28 minutes (and before you say you should have ganked the SF, I try to. If the mid sucks, it's incredibly difficult to execute a proper gank). Couple that with people in 3k still thinking if you're mid you should be ganking at 4 minutes and "wtf why would I gank mid that's your job", and you can see the issue.

I've analyzed plenty of my own replays, and while yes there are mistakes that I make, very few of them are game-changing in any way. 

I'm not sitting here saying I'm perfect, but MMR is not an accurate representation of skill in any way. If it were, it wouldn't be a static +/- 25 based solely on win/loss. It would be based on player performance. 1 person can't win a game every time. Yeah you can snowball and give your team the best possible odds, but 1 person will not consistently win a team-based game.  




  If you're on the same team with them (and at similar MMR), it's likely you're also "legit clueless"

That's actually completely not true. It took me 10 minutes to explain to a South American yesterday that certain abilities (in this instance Culling Blade and aghs Laguna Blade) pierce spell immunity. And I'm at 3k. Or the stupid amounts of MoM Slarks I see every other day.

I've lost every game since calibration on this account (roughly three weeks of playing) that I don't play mid. It's obvious at the end of the game that I'm the best player, I have the best gpm, xpm, KDA, etc. regardless of win or loss. So I need to be in a core role, because a good core carrying shit supports will win games way more often than a good support supporting shit carries. 

 It's likely that person you think is clueless does something well that you do poorly.

Yeah, feeding. 




 I'm still hoping Zim comes back to us. 




 Can confirm. Completely blew off high school, graduated with a 2.2 GPA and Honors status from one of the top 50 public high schools in the country.  




 DIET Mountain Dew? That shit is disgusting. 




 Single player games tend to bore the hell out of me, so if I want to have any semblance of fun playing a video game it has to be multiplayer. Call of Duty used to be my crack, but it's since gotten boring. I've logged more hours on Dota 2 than I'm proud to admit, and I'm being completely honest when I say this, the only thing that makes me stop playing this game is the fucking South Americans. I'd been playing for basically the past 12 hours, with a couple breaks to eat and watch a couple episodes of something, and I just closed Dota because I lost 50 mmr because of fucking South Americans.

The game is beautiful. The players are the worst thing in the entire world. I keep coming back because I love the teamwork aspect and all of the crazy mechanics, and keep getting turned completely away because of third worlders. This game would be perfect without a toxic community (South Americans).

 The point is that money is used by ultra-wealthy individuals and corporations/organizations to influence political legislature. And that's not okay, considering the politicians are supposed to be acting in the interest of the masses, not just the 1%.

It boils down to if you were a senator or congressman, who would you support? Ten million people who gave you nothing, or one person who gave you ten million? This is a capitalist society where money rules everything. And it's fucked up.

 The most harmful thing about marijuana is being caught with it by any type of authority that doesn't allow it.

 When I was barely a week or two old, my psychotic aunt took fingernail clippers to my nails thinking she was doing my mom a favor.

This made me cringe. Well done.

 We now go live to Ollie Williams with the blackie weather report. Ollie?

*IT'S RAININ' SIDEWAYS* 




 Don't we always have a ton of cap space to work with, but the front office just doesn't utilize it well? We're never the team making big moves. 

Yeah we just signed AJ Hawk, but even though he's a recognizable name, it's not like he's top 5, or really even 10, at his position. 




 The Colts have won the AFC South all but 4 times since '02.

In 5 years, that number will be 5 at highest. 




 For only 2 years though? And he's getting up there in age. 

I'm surprised I had to scroll this far to see a Bengals flair though. Initially I thought we would be one of the front-runners for him, but hopefully we're looking to grab someone younger. 




 We know what we're doing (by we I mean the Bengals organization, *not* the fanbase), we're putting faith in him. Whether or not that's the right decision will be figured out in the next few seasons. I'm always one of the first to criticize Dalton but he's led the Bengals to the playoffs more in 4 years than Carson Palmer did in 7, with comparable weapons.

Cutler's been around since '06, Dalton only since '11. 

You also have Tannehill in Tier 6 even though he's started 3 seasons and hasn't seen playoffs once. 

Not trying to nitpick super hard, but just saying.  




  Tier 6 (We go to the playoffs with this guy)

Considering Dalton's led us to the playoffs 4 years in a row, even though we didn't make it past the first round he should still be Tier 6. This year's loss wasn't his fault, we were missing our first 3 or 4 string WRs. 




 FUCK YOU I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME

 Best against Medusa though. 




 I love to lane against Kunkka as Nyx. Even though the Carapace cooldown is longer than Tidebringer, if you get your timings right you're in for a lane of lols. 




 I completely lost it at that point. +1 




 Hello! I'll be in Las Vegas this coming week for the first time and love beer. Suggestions?  




 Troll a problem in team fights? Pick Omni.

Troll a problem for split pushing? TP 2 heroes to tower and kill him/counterpush.

He's not broken. 




 Lydia is a fucking bitch. 




 3k. Nothing spectacular. But the second I get BoTs, whether it's early or late, I turn my focus to getting kills. Even TP'ing in at the last second to get a rocket kill is a huge boost for your team.

It seems to me at least that tinker isn't just a solo hero any more, he does rely on the team around him. I don't think that makes him bad, it just reduces the stomp factor. 




 Valve would probably do this. 




  if someone ganks you before travels and take your stack, you've almost lost the game singlehandedly for your team as you're now a liability during his most effective window, he falls off a lot, and to catch up you have to vacuum your carry's farm.

That's true for almost any traditional mid hero. Gank the sniper, gank the viper, gank the zeus, gank the storm, etc. Just because there are ways to counter him doesn't mean he's bad.

Maxing Q/W in lane is extremely strong against most heroes. I've gotten more kills then I can count because of a rocket to drop them a tad, wait for it to come off CD (this works best against mids that don't run bottles), laser, rocket, rearm, rocket. It's definitely not as easy as it was before, but in my personal opinion he isn't bad. 




 Tinker just relies on a team moreso now than he did before. He's also not supposed to be a carry, he's a core. There's a difference. March spam defending T3's is still not something to be underestimated.

I'm 12-4 in my last 16 games as tinker. Granted, this is on my smurf account so many of the games were against lower skilled players, but really he's not fundamentally different from a Viper mid. Viper falls off late game, but it's his participation in the 2-3 hero ganks/skirmishes in the 15-30 minute range that can give your team an advantage. The way I played him, I would almost stop farming creeps altogether and consistently solo kill the heroes I was able to. This frees up farm for our hard carry, gives me ~400 gpm if I get two kills a minute (which shouldn't be hard unless you're losing or the enemy team picked a lineup that groups up early mid game and pushes), and sets the opposing team back on farm and levels because I'm constantly killing 2 of them.  

Tinker was almost always weak late game. BKB completely countered him. He's a hero now that can still stomp in the hands of a skilled player, but not everyone can pick him and win a game solo. He was overpowered before the eblade/march nerfs, but I actually think he's balanced now.  




 It takes a lot more skill to be a dominating tinker after the march nerf than before. While that doesn't necessarily change pro play as much, it destroyed him in pubs. 




 My winrate as tinker is higher than any hero. He's not a bad and weak pick, but these days you can't take over a game like you used to be able to. I would go something like 30-2 in a 40 minute game before the eblade/march nerf because I had BoT, SR, Blink, Dagon1, Bottle before 20 minutes from ancient stacks and that's enough burst damage to fuck almost anyone over anywhere on the map at that time. I would just pick off supports for the next 5 minutes, get my eblade or Dagon5 and then I was near unstoppable.

You can't easily do that any more, so tinker is less of a mid-game dominator and relies more on his team for assistance. It doesn't make him bad, it just makes him less of a snowball hero.

 




 The age of dagon/eblade ended with the nerf to march and eblade. Don't remember exactly what patch that was though.

Although I still play it occasionally. The projectile on eblade wasn't even a huge nerf, you can still 100-0 someone if you just blink on top of them, eblade and light them the fuck up, depending on the hero of course.  




 This needs to be answered. 




 We need the best DE available imo.  




 Did anyone else think that said RTZ and got extremely confused?

 Andy Dalton 




 Bengals have 2 SB appearances plz edit 




 Jeremy Hill. The guy only started maybe half the games last year but put up really big numbers for a rookie. If all of Cincinnati's offensive weapons stay healthy, he could get a lot of room to work with and put up even bigger numbers. 




 They've been the Redskins since the 30's, if I'm correct. Nobody said a word about it before last year.

It's not even an issue, it's just people causing drama to cause drama.

 Because DotA servers are currently really shit. Especially the US ones. 




 I used to play CM carry when I first started out. Tranqs, Dagon, RoA, BKB, Blink, Eblade/Veil. Shit was disgusting. 




 Use bear as distraction...new meta 




  People in this MMR do not have trouble farming adequately

At almost 3k? Oh yes they do. Not all, but a very generous percentage stop cs'ing as soon as 15 minutes hits. It's not uncommon at all to see a 40 minute game end with only 2 heroes above the 150 cs mark.

 valve plz 




 Lol it wasn't someone in the game, the servers just choked on a massive dick for everyone. 




 Blink, TP scroll/BoTs, Force Staff.

I'm saying Force Staff because positioning is key throughout any stage of the game, especially post late game when items don't necessarily matter as much and it all depends all team play. 




 I play the game because I like playing the game. The items are cool, but since they provide nothing other than cosmetic value and no advantage for my hero mechanically, I'm not butthurt that I'm not getting any.

And you shouldn't be either, considering it's completely free to play. 




  What if players **had** to vote

No. It should be optional. 

 




 First punter in post season history to throw a TD pass? Is that really true? 




 First punter in post season history to throw a TD pass? Is that really true? 




 Commence breaking of reddit. 




 Woah, this thread is making reddit implode harder than Wilson. 




 Just got to this game thread. The fuck is happening out there? 




 What song is this? 




 Since nobody mentioned it: Gladiator 




 Don't forget Poorly Drawn Lines! 




 We need another solid CB to replace Newman. Dennard is looking promising, but another definitely wouldn't hurt. 




 Uh, he just finished his 4th year and still hasn't fixed his overthrowing problem. That's a pretty big deal.  




 This wasn't on Andy. We were missing 5/6 of our top receivers for this game. This game came down to Marvin Lewis proving once again he's incapable of winning big games, and also our D Line not being able to pressure Andrew Luck, resulting in the Colts offense to execute whatever they wanted. Andy didn't play spectacular, but this loss isn't on him. 




 It isn't all his fault. Yes he overthrows, that's the only consistent thing he's done in 4 years, but we were also missing 5 of our receivers. This game came down to the coaching staff, 90% Marvin Lewis, once again proving they are incapable of winning big games and our defensive line not being able to put any pressure on Luck, which allowed their offense to basically do whatever they wanted. I'd say this loss was only 20% Andy's fault. 









 Their win just made our playoff chances easier. While I'm not one to root for the Steelers in almost all situations, the win did us a favor if you look at playoff implications over the next two games of the season. 

Do I think we CAN win both games? Yes I do. We have the tools and we have the talent to pull out the wins. Do I realistically think we WILL? No. It will be a pleasant surprise if we do, but the coaching staff just isn't good enough. Look at this year's primetime games and games against top teams. We get behind early due to lack of preparation, abandon the run, and rely on the under pressure side of Dalton's passing to get us back into the game. And then we get stomped to the tune of 43-17 (Patriots Sunday Night), 27-0 (Colts), 42-21 (Steelers), 24-3 (Browns on Thursday Night) because he is not the elite quarterback that wins you games.

If we lose both games and still make the playoffs, you have the Steelers to thank. Just saying. 




 This game was atrocious. The ONLY good thing about this game was Marvin's call in the last 30 seconds that saved us from losing. Everything else was an absolute shit show.

Dalton showed us once again how much he can choke. Our defense, albeit being quite talented, missed multiple tackles and interceptions that ended up leading to big plays for TB. The offensive playcalling was better, but we fell into the same trap at the end where we were extremely predictable. There were also many stupid and unnecessary penalties, though the ones on Green and Newman were definitely questionable. 

We did not win because we were the better team. We won because we got lucky that Tampa Bay shot themselves in the foot harder than we did. If there is anything to take from this game, it's that the Bengals are still the same inconsistent team that can squeak out victories against sub-par teams and get stomped by good ones (Patriots, Colts).

I will be genuinely surprised if we don't end up 8-7-1. 




 These teams prioritized drafts that were aggressive early and had the main priority of taking down towers while simultaneously being good at defending their own. Their mindset was to get an advantage before their opponent, capitalize on it, and snowball to the point where they either took the Ancient or built an advantage so large that the enemy team essentially would just give up. It was objective gaming. The object of Dota is to destroy the enemy Ancient while also defending your own, not to farm heroes for 60 minutes.

If you're playing for five million dollars, are you going to play the game like Call of Duty and just kill everyone on the map, or are you going to play to win?

Quit crying. 




 Noticed this in both games I've played today, that when I pick a hero and go into a game I'm unable to open the shop or left click on the mini map to move the view around. I have to completely exit and restart dota in order for it to work correctly, and this has never happened to me before.

Anyone else experiencing this?

edit: I've spent time before the games watching TI4 replays, as someone mentioned below that it can be caused by spectating. In queue for a game currently, haven't watched a replay since last restarting dota so I'll update after I find a game.

edit2: Seems the big is indeed caused by watching replays. I don't want to say it's caused by spectating, as I've spectated live games in the past directly into a game and it hasn't happened.  




 In the jungle, if you wanted to maximize efficiency from Midas, does it matter which creep in a camp you use it on? For example early game in a Satyr camp, using it on one of the smallest satyr's will definitely give you more gold than just killing the satyr, but would the time taken to kill the biggest satyr normally instead of midas'ing it vs. the smallest satyr to get to the next camp outweigh that? Same goes with the wildwing's or wolves, do you want to Midas the main creep or one of the two smaller ones? 

And as far as experience goes as well, would you want the 2.5x from any particular creep or am I just thinking into this too deeply?

 




 IG, Vici, Newbee, they're rolling over teams with their massive amount of early push and most teams are just letting them do it. 

Shadow Shaman is the core hero in this strat, and yet I haven't seen him be first phase banned in any of the games so far. I can understand not giving up a Doom or Dire Lyan, but teams are also still first phase banning Batrider against Chinese teams that hardly pick him. 

And when they do first pick SS, why are teams not 2nd phase banning a DP? Unless you draft a lineup specifically tailored to defending a tower against BOTH of those ultimates at the same time, they're just going to take each tower uncontested, have more gold than you and end the game in 30 minutes because they're playing objectively. BKB doesn't stop the physical damage from both of their ultimates, if you're fighting into that you need to have a significant advantage or else you'll get ran over, and that's exactly what's happening.

The metas are different for each region. Heroes are valued differently in each region. Yes, it's starting to mix now that teams from different regions are playing each other a lot, but to me it just seems that Asian teams are drafting and banning significantly better. It seems that EU teams are drafting against Asia teams based on the EU meta, and that's not exactly what you want to do. Another example I can think of is constantly giving Universe his tidehunter, which is what wins EG a big percentage of their games. 

Thoughts?  




 Well that was fast. 




 Just downloaded whatever game client update they just implemented, and I'm trying to select the hero for the three votes. When I select a hero, it shows up in the box and then disappears and goes back to the "select hero" option.

This happening to anyone else? I've closed and re-open dota and it's still doing it.

edit: Just checked the client update post and noticed it was indeed confirmed as a bug. Carry on. 




 To preface this, I live in US East. When I'm awake between the times of 6-10 AM, not many people are playing DOTA on US East servers so it can take upwards of 10 minutes to find a game. My ping to EU West is under 150, so sometimes I queue there to get faster games. 

How the fuck do people play on this region? In the 15 or 20 games I've actually played on this region without fail at least 3 of the 9 other players do nothing but troll and flame the entire game. You don't even have to do anything to them, they'll just start flaming you for no reason. At least on US East you actually have to make some hostile action or comment to initiate the flame war.

What's more surprising is that I've always thought that EU players were supposed to be more skilled than US players. I'm no pro, I'm around 3k and the 3k players on EU play like players I've seen under 2k on US. Some of my games yesterday morning were played with some of the worst players I've ever had the misfortune of playing with. 

I know a lot of people, myself included, rag on US servers for having south americans ruin games, but your EU servers are ruined by your very own Europeans.

What keeps you from smashing your computer monitors every time you connect to a game? 




 In the final results screen after a match you can commend or report, is there any way to commend or report after you've disconnected? I just played a game where I wanted to commend a couple people but habitually clicked out of it before I remembered. 




 Was playing a game earlier against a PL that was able to farm a lot more securely than myself, and we already had ways to deal with his illusions so instead of getting a BF I got BKB Basher (was up against a lion tide and shadow shaman) and was repeatedly told by my teammates than I was an idiot and BF is way better. 

We ended up winning after their Tide abandoned and a few big team fights because of my BKB, avoiding Ravage and their massive amount of disable, but did I make the wrong decision? From what I've heard BF is a farm accelerator, I already built a midas and there was no way even with a BF I was going to outfarm the PL, so I got items that helped me take fights immediately. 

Thoughts? 




 Does anyone know what games are featured in the BTS intro? When the commentators yell "He's still alive" and "They're all dead" etc. 




 When you're killed, say the enemy has a mythical sword and a couple uncommon cosmetics equipped; how does it decide which item is highlighted under their portrait? Is it by rarity, random or what? 




 Aside from the internet bill you already pay, this game is completely free. Yes, there are an endless amount of things you can buy but you are not REQUIRED to buy anything. 

That being said, I would be more than willing to pay 5 dollars a month if that's what it took for Valve to implement region locked servers. Maybe not even all of the servers, you could leave the US West/East how they are, but people who choose to pay get a server called US Locked where you can only join if your IP is actually in the US for example. 

I love the teamwork and strategy and everything that goes into this game, and when three out of my four other teammates can't even speak the language of the server they're on it really just ruins the experience. And I know that is true for multitudes of other players in this game.

This would probably lead to longer queue times and bigger gaps in individual MMRs between players in games, as I know it will probably be the minority who would actually pay for it, but I'd rather wait an extra couple minutes for a game than get one in thirty seconds that is full of South Americans.

Thoughts?

Edit: Looks like half this subreddit got their cereal pissed in this morning.  




 Not sure if this is intended, or if I'm doing something incorrectly, but I was playing a game as Enigma yesterday, had my Soul Ring in my inventory and when I would click, hold, and drag to swap it to another slot in my inventory it would activate it. I've never seen this happen before with any items, not Treads or Phase or Mek or anything.

I played a game with Tinker a little bit later and don't think I noticed it happening, although I was sleep deprived at that point and maybe I just didn't move the soul ring or didn't notice it happening. Thoughts? 




 I know a little bit about how to draft and run them and when, but if anyone has a good explanation or a handy link they might be able to throw my way that would be much appreciated!  




 Is this intended? Got LP the other night because I got kicked from a game, couldn't reconnect, had to abandon. Played through a LP game where a few people abandoned, but my team won and I didn't get credit for the win but I figured it was because of the abandons. But just now I won a game with no abandons or anything, and didn't get credit for the win.

The tooltip only says "match-making". Does Low Priority not count as "match-making", or is this some kind of bug?  




 Like how you can watch the D2CL, etc. in-game, can you do the same with TI4? 




 When you physical attack with a Deso in your inventory, does the debuff get applied before that first instance of damage or is the attack damage applied, and then the Deso debuff applied? 









 So I abandoned one game because the captain was a troll and picked 5 hard carries while laughing at us the whole time, and my computer froze during another game later and I got an abandon for that so now I'm in low priority. It said I have 5 games remaining, but I've played through 2 so far and it still says 5.

Anyone know why this is? 




 Is this true? Granted, he can't carry as hard super late game with equal farm as a Spectre or Anti Mage maybe, but if the average game time is around 40-50 minutes, isn't he still a very viable option provided he can actually get the farm? Whenever I try to pick him in CM there's always someone telling me he isn't a hard carry, but when I play him I go solo offlane and usually build AquilaPhaseSnYDeso/Diffusal/Butterfly/MKB and can literally 4 or 5 shot supports. And his ult reveals invisibles, and provides movement speed and extra gold for the whole team.

Thoughts? 




 Dotabuff, I'm Weaver: http://dotabuff.com/matches/579545847

I was the captain too! Solo offlane weaver, lion TP'd up a couple times for a gank because they were pushing the lane really hard and after a couple kills and a quick linken's and even quicker butterfly it was over. 

I just wish I could do this in all pick or even captain's mode really. Nobody ever trusts me when I want to solo lane a weaver, even though some of my best games in unranked pubs were weaver mid. 

Kind of also looking for feedback though, I played a pretty flawless game but it wasn't perfect, if some dota pro's in here have some advice for me I'd gladly accept it!

hashtagroadoutof2.4kMMR 




 So Mask of Madness causes you to take additional damage according to the tooltip. How does this work in conjunction with items like Blade Mail, or passives like Centaur's Return? Because you are taking more damage via the MoM, will you be dishing out more damage as well or does it not work that way? 
























 The prettiest people do the ugliest things. 




 Wut? 




  it's kinda pointless to discuss strategy in pubs

Uh, actually that's most of what this subreddit is for considering 99% of the people on here only play pubs. It's actually more pointless to talk about pro dota considering, again, that 99% of the people on here are not pros. And neither you nor OP specified which you were referring to.

Bye Felicia. 




 Yeah but that applies to any hero, not specifically these 4. 




 Well, there's this super cool thing called Google that I guess not many people have heard about that has dozens of guides on how to play this hero. 

But since you're lazy and I'm bored, you start off by maxing your Morph ability and Waveform, stopping off to take your Ultimate at 6. Morphing to agility gives you more damage, but less health, and morphing to strength does the opposite. Finding the correct balance in the early game takes practice and depends on the lanes. If you're in a safe tri lane, you can afford to morph more agility for damage to ensure last hitting because you won't be taking near as much harass as say if you were running mid or offlane.

The way Morphling wins late game is having a shit ton of damage and a shit ton of armor from maxing out your Morph ability on Agility. You build items that give you survivability, such as Linken's Sphere, Butterfly, I've seen Skadi Morphlings before, etc. The Eblade build, or Shotgun build, is used to blow the everloving fuck out of one of the enemy heroes, usually a key support or utility hero, at the very beginning of the fight making it a 4v5. The Eblade nerf hurt this build however, so I'm not sure if it's still too viable. Morphling is rarely run in this current meta. Eblade increases magic damage taken, and a maxed out Agility Adaptive Strike plus a Waveform does a metric fuck ton of damage and will usually 1 shot somebody below 2k health, maybe even more. I'm not bored enough to do the math. This however falls off in later portions of the game when enemies build BKBs and get more health in general.

Your ultimate is used in multiple ways. You can make a replicate of the enemy hard carry and use it to attack for your team, or make a replicate of a teammate to send to another lane to jump to to continue farming when you've pushed your lane too far out. Additionally, you can instantly replicate out of a sticky situation in a fight where you might die by sending the replicate out of the fight or keeping it back beforehand.

If you're ever in a pickle, you have two options. Replicate out, or start morphing to strength to gain a ton of health and hopefully survive where you might have died.

The general build I used to run was Acquila  Treads  Linkens  Eblade  Butterfly Skadi, and by that point the game was usually over. I haven't played Morphling in months however. Once you have Eblade, you want to be running around with maxed or almost maxed agility to pull off your Shotgun combo effectively. 

Morphling isn't a hero that can 1v5 and destroy the enemy team, usually. Because he requires the maxing of agility and reduction of strength to do the most damage, he is vulnerable and requires heroes around him that can protect him and pull aggro off of him if needed.

One cool thing to note is that you can Morph to strength or agility while stunned (definitely) or rooted (I believe). However, not while silenced. So if the enemy team has silences that could fuck you over, consider building a Manta.  




  Tinker gets destroyed by Sniper in lane

Wut? My 3k Tinker shits on Snipers in lane. Fuck going March build, just rocket spam him. Maybe it won't work in Very High Skill brackets where Snipers run bottles, but if you're in "the trench" Tinker should easily win. 




 Blink, Laser, oh no troll bkb'd!, Ghost Scepter, Rearm, Ghost Scepter, Rearm, Ghost Scepter, Laser, Profit. 




 Anyone who's good knows he's not a support. Wait until your trash tier carry stops farming at 10 minutes to go teamfight before he's ready, secure lane farm for yourself and let him die, dominate the mid game kill stealing with your ult and laugh in their faces when you carried harder than they did.

 




  where the only time I'll need it are if I get an Illusion rune or for some reason build a Necro book. And in that case I can just CL cycle them if I need them to do something different than what my hero is doing, yeah?

 




 Mine, keeping in mind I don't use quickcast. That's probably because I don't use mouse movement and have never really seen the point of quickcast:

123456 - spells (Played WoW for 4 years where your spells took up 1 through =, so hitting the 5 or 6 is already muscle memory and not an issue at all)

TAB - select all units

CAPSLOCK - cycle through units

Space - Select Hero

Q - attack move

E - Stop/Cancel

ZXCVFR - items

WASD - Camera Move

Basically the difference I'm seeing is that if I use mouse movement, that frees up 4 buttons to use for control groups. But what I'm also seeing is that only helps me play micro-intensive heroes, which I have no real interest in playing anyway because they just aren't my style, and that's less than 5% of the hero pool. Control Groups are useless on something like a Lion or Magnus, where the only time I'll need it are if I get an Illusion rune or for some reason build a Necro book. And in that case I can just CL cycle them if I need them to do something different than what my hero is doing, yeah? 

My hand position rests with pinky finger on Shift, ring finger on A, middle finger on W, index finger on D, and thumb on C, so all of the above buttons are able to be pressed instantly. I do use Edge Pan as well though, so I suppose I use a mixture of Edge Pan and WASD. 




 Why are they inferior? If I'm using keyboard controls, my mouse is free to go wherever I want it to, rather than it being on the edges of the screen using Edge Pan or MMB.

It's not any slower, because Edge Pan and WASD movement are both dependent on what your camera speed is set to. Mine is set pretty high, and my WASD actually moves my camera faster than what MMB does.
 




 I can see how the control groups would be more efficient for illusions and summons. 

But if I'm playing a Weaver, Tinker, Centaur, Magnus, QoP, Lion, Crystal Maiden, Earthshaker, or any of the other heroes that don't require the use of illusions or summons 99% of the time, what are control groups used for?

And I know I'm going to end up typing something in caps in chat more often than not, but eh. It'll work. 




  select illusions/summons 

I've got that on TAB for all and CAPSLOCK for cycle currently.

 select hero button

Space bar.

 chat commands

Actually that would be useful considering I'm still using the default Y+mouse direction for those. 

 awfully slow compared to all other methods.

Really? I've got my camera speed up pretty high, it doesn't seem like it's any slower than Edge Pan or MMB.

I dunno it just feels like I'm not grasping the concept of why WASD is so bad.  




 The way it looks, if I want to move the camera up with MMB, I have to click and drag down. What if a hero is running up and I want to follow it with the camera, using MMB, and cast an ability on them? I'm dragging the mouse AWAY from where I want to be casting my ability, meaning I'll then have to move my mouse back from the bottom, to the top to cast an ability on the hero. Whereas with WASD I can just hold the keys and keep my mouse free to click wherever I want. Edge Pan would work the same as WASD in that sense, but MMB seems like it would be way more garbage. Unless I'm missing something.

edit: I was missing the option to Reverse Camera Grip. 




 Attack-move is Q, I have Stop bound to E. 

I never use the Move command, if I want to send a unit somewhere without issuing an attack command I just select it and right click it to where I want it to go. 

I figured out above how to cycle through controlled units, something I had always thought I could do but accidentally unbound some time in the past. 

I played WoW for 4 years, where your spells took up 1 through =. I have no problem at all doing the quick reach to hit a 5 or 6 if necessary if I even choose to play those heroes.

Currently my setup is 123456 for skills, WASD for camera move, ZXCVFR for items, TAB is select all units, CAPSLOCK is cycle through units now that I figured that out. 

I don't know, I've never felt like I had any issues being able to play any heroes this way. I consider Tinker one of my best heroes and playing him requires hitting up to 7 or 8 different keys in rapid succession, of which I have no issue. The only issue I can see might arise is with micro-intensive heroes like Meepo or Chen, but micro-intensive heroes don't interest me so I don't really care to change my entire setup to accommodate heroes I don't want to play anyway, you know? 




 Okay, I had bound TAB to select all units some time in the past. Went ahead and switched that, thank you. 




 What other things would I need to utilize those keys for though? I don't have quickcast hotkeyed to anything, is that something I should be using? It sounds like a neat idea, but I also don't think that the time it takes to press the hotkey and actually click the mouse for me (near instantaneously) is worth keybinding 4-6 keys for.

I suppose I could keybind control groups to the keys for micro-intensive heroes, but I try to avoid playing those anyway because I just don't like them. 




 Also, random question, but is there any way to hotkey a button that scrolls between different units? For example if I pop my Manta Style and want to quickly send my 2 illusions and hero in different directions, would there be a button I could hit that selected specifically 1 illusion, and then if I hit it again, specifically the other illusion, hit it again, back to hero, again, back to 1st illusion, again, back to other illusion, etc.? 




 Why is it better though? And if you use Edge Pan or MMB, what's the difference between keeping it on 1234 vs. QWER? 

Currently I use do WASD as camera, and have my 6 item slots bound to ZXCVFR. XCV are the items I use most in a game (Blink, Phase Boots, Force Staff, etc.) with R usually being hero specific items (Hex, Ghost Scepter/Eblade, Dust). I don't have any problem hitting these keys because over the years my finger dexterity has only gotten better (just ask my girlfriend ;)).

 




 So I've been playing Dota 2 for about a year and a half now. It was the first game of its kind I'd ever played. Before that, I'd played Call of Duty and World of Warcraft among other games extensively on the PC, so I was no stranger to PC online gaming.

I've never bound my Dota 2 spells to QWER, I've had them as 1234 the whole time because after a good 7 years of online gaming, 1-9 were always spells, switching weapons, killstreaks, etc. and WASD was always camera or player movement of some sort. It's so ingrained in my muscle memory that I figured it would be more detrimental for me to switch that around and try to learn something new than stick with what I've always done, and could also hinder my performance in other games. 

What is the advantage that binding your spells to QWER gives in Dota 2? A second part, and most of the reason for asking this, is that I've recently picked up one of [these](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BcyeIQuSL.jpg) mice. It has two buttons I could use to bind things to in Dota 2 that I haven't experimented with yet, and was wondering what might be the most beneficial things in the game to bind to it. 




 Mute them all and just play your game. Focus on learning. Watch your replays too. If you're dying a lot, look at WHY you're dying. Were you in the enemy jungle without vision? Did you commit to a fight you were outnumbered in? Should you have backed out instead of going for that last kill? 

There's no one quick trick to getting better at Dota, it all just takes time and practice. 




 Eh Lion actually isn't as great as you'd think. Lion's burst is great in the early game, but Sniper and Troll should always build a BKB, Axe usually does, and Jug has built in Magic Immunity which completely counters Lion.

Lina, however, would be decent if you're able to farm an Aghs Scepter because the Scepter changes your ult's damage type to Pure and allows it to pierce spell immunity. 




 Then you just need to play more. Stick to one hero for a while just to get basic mechanics to become muscle memory. One mistake I made at first was trying to become a jack of all trades/master of none. 

Also I'd recommend playing the Limited Hero game mode. Those heroes tend to be simpler to understand, have less complicated synergies/mechanics, and greatly reduce the amount of "what the fuck was that" potential in a game.  




  tinker 

Before the March/Eblade nerf yes. I rose 500 MMR by spamming Tinker. Shit was insanely easy.

Now though it's way harder to win solo as a Tinker. If your team won't push with you, you're not going to win.
 




  Winning mid is more about your skill vs. the enemies mids skill then anything else

Debatable depending on your MMR. 

2k, yes because you RARELY get support rotations into the mid to gank. 2k is the mindset where if the mid isn't ganking a sidelane the minute they hit 6, it's a reportable offense. 

4k however, if one team's support rotates a couple times even just to apply pressure and the other team's does not, the former team's mid may win out over the latter even if the latter is more skilled. 




 I wouldn't. Naga is a hero that relies pretty heavily on coordination within the entire team to be utilized correctly.

You rarely get that in solo queue.  




 I've gotten multiple on Bloodseeker, Weaver, Sven and Crystal Maiden but I think that's it. 




 Watch pro gameplays. Usually the commentators do a great job (depending on who it is) explaining what's going on, item choices for heroes, why teams are doing specific movements around the map, etc.

I've learned way more watching pro gameplays than I ever would have just playing the game. 




 Omniknight's ult counters them because they all rely on physical damage.

Vengeful Spirit is pretty good because you can use her ult to swap an important carry out of a death situation, and if you die your 3rd skill reduces the enemies' physical damage output.

Dazzle is good because your ult gives your team +armor and the enemy team -armor if you land it on everyone, and Shallow Grave will keep an ally alive for a potential escape against all but Axe.

Disruptor can be good if played correctly, by Glimpsing initiators back out of the fight or dropping a huge ultimate on 3-4 during a fight.

Ghost Scepter is an item that makes you invulnerable to physical damage, is great against these heroes.

Heaven's Halberd disarms the enemy, so they can't physically attack anyone for the duration and also provides evasion.

Just to name a few. 




 Slark destroys Sniper as well. 




 Did you even read the hero names? Sniper is THE hero for low MMR games, and has been since Dota 2 came out. Axe has always been picked in low MMR games too. Troll is the only one of the four that hasn't been a consistent pick for 3k MMR. 

And like the other reply said, 

 you have to remember that the people who play against them are even worse at countering them then the axe troll and jugg pickers are at playing them.

Bye Felicia. 




 Lol what? These heroes are picked every game from 1k MMR to Pro Tournaments. You're an idiot. 




 http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+get+better+at+dota+2 




 A:256

B:30

2.7k MMR 




 Troll and Axe both need nerfs in my opinion.

Troll needs his base movement speed slightly reduced, and maybe a slight reduction in health in melee axe form to be balanced.

Not really sure how to make Axe balanced but he's way too strong in the laning stage. 




 Yeah my comment was tongue in cheek regarding the horrible nature of South Americans specifically on this video game.

Calm it down. 




 Average 




  Very High Skill


 0 BKBs against a Tinker/Ogre/Zeus with 3 Dagon 5's.

lolwut 




  What the hell is the problem if I want to play something other than AP or CM for MMR?

You do. It's just hidden MMR. Kappa. 




 There's a difference between picking something inappropriate for your team and randoming a hero you have no idea how to play but keeping it just for the extra gold.

 




 I played a game like this earlier tonight. 2 people on my team said nothing throughout the entire draft, didn't lock heroes or anything. 

3 of us had already picked PL, Clinkz, Jakiro. The final two randomed Naga Siren and Tinker. Neither had any clue how to play the hero they randomed, and barely spoke English (surprise surprise).

Needless to say we got completely stomped because Tinker fed the shit out of the enemies' Sniper mid and the Naga was only good for using her Ult to escape and throwing down maybe 1 or 2 good nets the entire game. I reported them for Intentional Ability Abuse, was happy to see two notifications pop up later in the night that they got put into low priority.

Tinkers one of my best heroes. If the stupid Peruvian had spoke English I could have swapped him, but alas, another game ruined because of South Americans. Typical Dota 2. 




 I believe if you die with rapier the item is no longer bound to you, meaning you no longer own it.

Contrasted to if you drop your Yasha, even if someone picks it up, that item is still bound to you and only you benefit from the stats. 




 Lol. 




  Juggernaut can perform normal attacks during Blade Fury, but these attacks will deal no damage to enemies being affected by Blade Fury.

From the Dota 2 wiki. How is this supposed to work? Does this mean you can't auto attack an enemy while BF'ing unless they're already magic immune? 




 Christ. With that team composition you deserved to lose.

Also, the guy's friend is retarded. If he raises it any more than 500 he's just going to get stomped back down to where he was in the first place.  




 Take a break and do something else.

 




 I don't understand why everyone is crying about it.

If you have a huge lead and the enemy outplays you and wins a teamfight, it's your fault for getting outplayed and losing a teamfight that you should have won. 

How is this any different than previous patches where teams would draft insanely good T3 tower defense with a 4 protect 1 carry strat, lose all outer towers at 20 minutes and defend for the next 30 until their carry became unkillable? 

 




 Dear South America: 

Please cut off all internet access to your favelas. 

Sincerely, World. 




 That's a good mentality to have and makes you a better player. I've learned to never trust or rely on random teammates in video games, because 90% of the time they'll fail you.

However in this case, split pushing would have just stalled the inevitable further. If the Sven and LS didn't build MKB for 60 minutes, they were trash and you weren't going to win.

If they had built MKB, you probably would have won considering a couple teamfights could have gone your way and you could have transitioned those into Roshans or tower pushes. But that's Dota.

 Alt clicking is great because South Americans that queue on US E without speaking a word of English can still communicate the cooldowns/availabilities of items and spells. In a game such as this where communication is arguably the biggest key to victory, and Valve refuses to region lock, it was kind of needed. 

I for one am against making the game too much easier. Making things easier is what kills online multiplayer video games. I used World of Warcraft as an example in a thread earlier. In my opinion that game is absolute shit now after they lowered the skill cap for literally everything in WotLK. Call of Duty is another good example. 4 was one of the greatest games ever made because it was barebones, simple, and required heavily on reaction time and pure gun skill. Look at the shit they did with MW3 and BO2, as examples. They made weapon attachments that were literally hacks in previous games (Target Finder, Dual Band) and those games are shit now.

There was a suggestion earlier that was put forward by an alleged 4.2k player saying warding was too difficult and "it's a needed change" that Valve should implement a special courier THAT GOES OUT AND WARDS FOR YOU. Shit like that would ruin the game, and is an absolutely stupid suggestion.

I don't exactly know where I was going with this reply, but changes that make communication easier I'm all for. However, mechanical changes are when you cross the line. Skill shots are a great example. If they made landing Slark's Pounce any easier, it would be too much. Or WR's Shackleshot. In-game timers that were visible to players for Roshan or enemy buybacks would be too much. Just a couple examples I thought of.  




 You probably wouldn't have won even if you did split push. Your bat and sven were trash. 




 Maybe not at minute 4, but a riki with some farm hiding off in the trees blink striking in on an underleveled support running out of fountain? Or ganking couriers?

It obviously isn't a great idea, and I wouldn't advocate it, but it definitely could be annoying. 




 With heroes like Troll, Jug, Axe, Sniper, Lion extremely strong in this meta it's almost impossible to pub stomp with her. 

She loses hard to heroes that can burst her down quickly, and that's what the meta is about right now. 




 And then get initiated on immediately by a blade mailed Clock/Axe/LC. Fun times. 




 Some of them are good ideas. Alt clicking allied spells to indicate "Use ____ Now" in chat could be very useful.

Then some of them, like the alleged 4k player suggesting a specific courier be put into the game that wards for you, are fucking retarded.

But that's how this entire subreddit is so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Why the fuck won't my shrug ever work? It's always missing its fucking left arm.

I kind of like this one better though so ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯ 




 I actually haven't seen one of those in a couple months.  




 It could work. 




  for you lefties

What does being left handed have to do with any of this?
 




 Because you're in the lead and you lost a fight. That shouldn't happen.

Don't think of it as being penalized for losing a fight, think of it as the other team being rewarded for winning a fight that realistically they shouldn't have won due to your advantage. They outplayed a stronger opponent, and deservedly get more reward. 




  At this point, the Glyph being refreshed after a Tier 1 tower falls is just dumb and appears to be a gross overreaction when combined with the comeback formula.

Maybe when combined with the formula, but do you remember TI4? 20 minute gg's because you win a team fight at 15 minutes and take 3 towers afterwards was stupid.  




 He can be used as a niche last pick sometimes, but Huskar relies on lack of coordination on the opposing team to be useful. He's a great pubstomper because he ults in and people go full panic mode, but that's not how pro teams operate.

And no pro team wants an initiator whose initiation ability drops themselves to half health right off the bat.  




 Just do what I do. If someone on the opposing team is flaming me, get 1-2 of your teammates and make it your sole objective for the next 20 minutes to gank them whenever possible and make their game extremely unfun.

Or just mute them, outplay them, win the game and type JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA [Their Hero Name] over and over as you kill their Ancient. 




  i believe that if people didnt feed nobody would complain

You have too much faith in the internet. People will flame you for anything and everything. 




 99% of the time the pros get aegis immediately barring some sort of engagement going on in the pit at the same time. I've rarely seen a pro team do rosh and sit for more than 2 seconds without picking up aegis/cheese.

in b4 "BUT X PLAYER IN X GAME RAN AWAY AND DIDN'T GET IT UNTIL HE WENT BACK 5 SECONDS LATER" 




 If you were going in first, you were doing it wrong. The correct way to win that lane would be for CM to go around behind her when the wave was closer to your tower, freeze her, then you run in with your whirling axes. At that point she should be easy food.
 




 Meepo, Earth Spirit and Invoker every time because I've never tried to learn them. Most of the time I'll repick Chen/Enchantress but I've had decent games with them.

Otherwise I can pretty much play every hero in the pool. Aside from those, I'll only repick if I randomed a hero and the enemy team had already picked a hard counter. 




 As the title says, when is the best time to buy BoTs in a game? I expect this depends on the hero, like with a tinker you want them ASAP, and with an AM it's good to pick them up early to split push and farm lanes more effectively. And sometimes you don't need to buy them at all.

But is there a general rule of thumb for when to pick up BoTs on other heroes? What I've been doing is if I can tell that if I complete my next item and doing so won't leave me a spot for a tp scroll, I'll go ahead and buy BoTs and prolong that item a bit longer to ensure I'm not caught in a position where I need to TP somewhere for a teamfight or defense. This usually comes around the 30-40 minute mark (3k MMR here, so it's not like at that point I'm fully 6 slotted or anything), both on supports and cores.

Thoughts? 




 4.2k and you don't know how to ward? That's pretty sad. I just played a Lion solo support. They had weaver and invoker, so I had dust on me from minute 1 until the end.

Good gold management and the fact that both ours and the enemy team's outer towers were all taken out around the 35 minute mark allowed me to sell my Tranquils and purchase BoTs, meaning I could keep BoTs, Magic Wand, Blink, Force, Observers and Dust on me. Our viper bought a gem relatively early as well, so whenever we felt like dewarding I went around with him and dewarded. Since a couple of us had dust, we didn't need the gem in team fights and we kept it in base.

Didn't have a problem with space management once in the entire game, and managed to ward throughout a 55 minute game as a solo support without any issues.

You're 4.2k and you can't figure that out? Once again: SOUNDS LIKE A PERSONAL PROBLEM. Get better. 

Peace out. 




 3k. But I don't see anyone else supporting your suggestion, and I haven't seen anyone else complain about warding being difficult. If people thought this was a problem, you'd have support. (See what I did there?)

Do I WANT to leave my dust or bracer in stash to go ward? Not particularly. But I'm also not going to propose a stupid suggestion to "fix" something that isn't even a problem. It only takes a couple minutes to ward, then you get your item back, then 6-10 minutes later you do it again. It's part of being a support.

Good players don't have a problem warding.

So once again, it sounds like a personal problem.  




 There were a lot of factors in addition to it for me in real life too. It was also just my personal opinion that the game in general just felt too easy. 




 Consumables aren't needed after minute 10. If you're running around with tangos or a mana potion taking up a slot at minute 20+, you're doing it wrong. Wards take precedence.

Magic Stick/Wand falls off after 20-25 minutes. As a support, you'll have enough mana to cast enough abilities to where you won't need the boost, and if you're gone on first in a gank attempt, the stick charges probably aren't going to save your life enough of the time to warrant holding onto it. If you feel like holding onto it, put it in your stash, go ward, TP back, grab it from stash. Wards take precedence.

If you're holding a bracer at minute 40 and claim you don't have a spot for wards, you're doing it wrong. Bracer only gives somewhere between 100-150 health. That's enough to survive 1 extra attack from their carry, if that. Applies to components such as Null Talisman, Void Stone, Ring of Regen, etc. Put it in your stash, go ward, have it delivered back. Wards take precedence.

Dust or Smoke as well, either put it in your stash or give to an ally, grab it back after you ward. Wards take precedence.

Warding is YOUR job as a support. Wards take precedence over all but 3 of the things you listed above, especially considering it should only take 2 minutes tops to place them before you can get the other items back. If you're playing correctly and warding at the correct times (hint, NOT running blindly into their jungle when all enemy heroes are alive and missing from the map) then none of this is an issue. You also have 4 other heroes on your team that can assist you in this entire process. Your position 4 has an extra slot? Give them the Observers. Your Batrider and Storm Spirit want to gank the Riki farming too aggressively in bot lane? Pass them the Dust. A change isn't needed at all. Get better. 




 Definitely practice your last hitting. At up until 3k, that's the biggest thing that can give you the edge over your opponents. 

Also learn item builds on heroes. For example you're buying a Null Talisman on the Spectre games I looked at. Completely useless and a waste of gold on that hero, meaning you are less effective in the laning stage than you should be, giving you a hard start on a hero that usually needs a good start to be effective. Shadow Blade is also useless on that hero, and to some extent Spirit Breaker as well.

You're also not really picking strong heroes to play. Visage and Elder Titan are probably way over your skill level, and Spectre isn't really that strong right now and definitely not in your MMR where most of your games are 30 minute 1 sided victories.

My advice would be to learn some bigger tempo controllers, outfarm your opponents and control the game. But that doesn't mean run into 3 heroes solo and expect to triple kill them. Solo pick off heroes are usually the best because 1. Players in that MMR rarely buy wards or TP scrolls, and generally don't have the map awareness to utilize them properly and 2. Players tend to farm and play way over aggressively. Punish that with a Shadow Bladed Slark killing a solo hero at your top T2 when their team is in their jungle or other lanes, for example. 




 You can't re-calibrate. What he's referencing is creating a new account, power leveling to 13 and doing ranked matches again to see if you place higher. Which is completely pointless if you aren't any better than when you calibrated the first time. If you are, then you'll be higher. But the thought process also is that if you're truly better than the 9 other people in the lobby, you should be able to single handedly carry your team to victory and increase your MMR that way on the account you play at normally. 




 Maybe you should have only punch it 2 times. 




 rekt 




 And you sound like the kind of person that if you're not good enough to do something, would rather have it changed to be easier than getting better and improving your personal skill.

Like I said too: If you're a good player, the current mechanics aren't a problem in any way. 

If you're a support, you should always have a slot designated for Wards. Just like a good player always designates a slot for a TP scroll. It's part of the role you're playing. Wards are more important than the component of an uncompleted item that could stay in your stash until you've completed it fully. In 99.9% of games, the position 5 support will never be six slotted to the point where you have to drop something more important for your team than wards.  




 You pay a monthly or yearly subscription to be able to play WoW. It's been four years or so since I last paid for it, so I don't remember the actual cost of it. 

What I mean by making the game easier is that they implemented purchasable (with real life money) items into the game that made basically every aspect of the game easier. Power leveling (leveling from 1 to the level cap) used to take a lot of time and effort. After these items, you could do it in a fraction of the time. These items were extremely powerful and took out a core aspect of the game where you had to sit and think about the benefits of choosing one item over another. Basically you bought these items, they scaled with your level (IIRC) and you never really had to worry about your itemization until you hit the level cap.

They also (from my experience) nerfed raiding (going into a dungeon with 5, 10, 25, etc. different people) so that instead of having to figure out strategies and use tons of teamwork to be able to down a boss, you could blow through it easily because none of the fights were anywhere near as difficult, coupled with the fact that you had these really strong items.

They earned more money because the game was more accessible to millions of other people who could buy it, load it up, and be able to get that feeling of accomplishment very quickly instead of having to work for it, as opposed to the game being a challenge and potentially turning people away because they couldn't figure it out or weren't good enough to get through certain parts. 

I started to despise it because everything I'd spent tons of time working for for the past 4 years was now extremely easy. The sense of accomplishment went away. For me, if a game isn't challenging, it isn't fun. 
  




  Agreed, but taking time to micromanage such a petty task (unloading items in order to ward) takes away from the much more important micromanagement that takes place during battles and map control.

If you're a good player this isn't a problem at all. If you're not a good player, then it sounds like a personal problem.  




 I used to adore Blizzard. Played WoW for about 4 years, from around the time AQ was released pre-BC to right before the Cataclysm expansion.

Could just be my personal opinion, but halfway through WotLK they completely destroyed that game. I understand their model, making the game so easy an 8 year old can be successful makes it more appealing to the masses, which makes them more money; but it got to the point where everything was so easy that the game was no longer challenging in any way. 

If that happened to Dota 2 it would be a very sad day indeed. 




 Link to dotabuff? If you're 700 I guarantee the reason you're so low is because you don't know how to farm.

Tip: Stop playing ranked for a bit, learn a hero that can come online early with heavy snowball potential (Drow, Bloodseeker, Slark, Troll Warlord, Axe are some of the easier examples to play and can also utilize the jungle well) and practice your last hitting in bot games. At 700 MMR, spend your first 20 minutes farming and not dying or participating in stupid fights. ONLY enter a fight if you know you will survive and will be able to get a kill or two out of it (for example if three enemy heroes are tower diving at less than half health. TP in, clean them up. Profit.) My experiences with lower MMR players is that they'll horribly farm for the first 8 minutes and then spend the rest of the time running at you Call of Duty style instead of continuing to farm. 

If you can come out at 20 minutes with 2-3 items and maybe even 4-6 levels ahead of them, go around and continuously pick them off if they're solo and transition that into tower pushes. Nobody at 700 MMR is going to be coordinated enough to kill you at that point. 




 I've tried to do this way too many times. I like this idea. 




  wasting time in such micromanagement can be potentially game-costing.

The ability to micromanage throughout a potentially 60+ minute game is a big part of what separates great players and teams from mediocre ones. 

 




 Not really. There's a big difference between not being able to play at all and a minor distraction. 




 If I'm sitting in front of my TV, at a bar, or even in the seats of the stadium itself as a spectator, it's impossible for me to injure a player.

As opposed to DDOS'ing a Dota player which can be done from anywhere across the world. 




 This only matters above 4k where you'll get differences of 100-1000 MMR between teammates.

The difference in player skill relative to MMR between a 1000 player and 1500 player is almost zero, same for a 2000 and 2500, and probably even 3000 and 3500.

 [This could be my alarm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDz9B9VGcpQ)

I think I remember hearing that he used to be a radio announcer or DJ before he got into Dota, which would explain why he seems like the most experienced behind a microphone. Is this true? 




 I just can't stand his voice. That's not something he can really control, so I can't fault him as a person for it, but I just can't listen to it. 

Honestly he casts like a 16 year old on a sugar rush.  




 My problem with Zyori is that his jokes suck. All of his attempts to be funny, in my opinion, just completely fall flat. He's also completely wrong about... well, everything a lot of the time. He'll sit pondering something for two minutes when it's plainly obvious even to a 3k "scrub" like me that watches maybe 2-3 pro dota gameplays a day what the answer is. 

He's gotten a little better than he used to be, so I guess the progress is good. But if I see him casting a gameplay replay of teams that I either don't know or don't necessarily care about on dotacinema I won't watch it. Compare that to Tobi, Sunsfan/Synderen, Godz, Kotlguy, where I would watch the game even if it was a pub. 




 I like all of BTS except Lysander. I cannot fucking stand Lysander. 




 I want to start off by saying ~6 months ago, I despised Capitalist as a caster. His tone and demeanor in general was just so... smarmy. He even replied to a comment I made in a thread where I bashed him. Since then however, he's actually really grown on me and I don't mind watching his casts. So if you're reading this Cap, I apologize for my previous comment and keep up the good work :)

Kotlguy is also quickly becoming one of my favorite casters. I don't know how long he's been in the scene, but I've really only discovered him in the past month or so. It's funny though, and this could just be me personally, but when he casts with Zyori (who is still really terrible) he tends to cast down to Zyori's level as opposed to if he's solo or with somebody different. 

What happened to Ayesee? He was everywhere around TI4 and I don't think I've seen him since. 

Somebody like Tobiwan, I'll watch games he's casting even if I don't know the teams because he's just the best in my opinion. Very knowledgeable and entertaining as well. Godz sails in the same boat, although he doesn't cast nearly as much. 

Who are your guys' favorites, least favorites, honorable mentions, dream caster combo's, etc. and why?

edit: Completely forgot about Sunsfan and Synderen because I haven't seen them in forever. Another two favorites! 




 /r/nocontext is having a field day with this thread. 




 Bane/SD Mirana +1 was used heavily around TI4.  




 It's pretty core on Puck. His whole thing is being as evasive as possible. 

It's pretty core on Jakiro too unless you have a reliable setup stun already on your team to set up ice paths. 

It's not core per se on Invoker, but it makes landing his spells a hell of a lot easier.

And Eul's is great on DP for the movement speed, but again not necessarily core. 




 It might work for solo pick offs, but in a team fight if they notice your MoM on while dueling you're going to get bursted so hard you'll end up losing most of your duels. 




 Exactly. 




 Sounds exactly like when I try to play at 4 AM US East and get teams full of South Americans.

Seriously. They "farm" for 10 minutes and spend the rest of the game just running at you. It's fucking annoying. 




 Weird, it shows up in the text box if I go to edit it. 




 This is the account I've been playing on for the past few months, not my main though. Ignore the Ogre, Slark and QoP games, those were fresh after a blunt to the face and I always play terribly when I'm high. I also meant to queue for Normal, not Ranked, but marijuana ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

http://www.dotabuff.com/players/206703220

I'm not sitting here saying I'm pro, but the only one of the Latest Matches losses that was anywhere close to my fault (aside from the above) was the 4/8/12 where I lost mid to a smurf SF. 

The hardest part about getting out of 2k/3k is that 90% of the time your team doesn't know the correct course of action. People in 5k know that at around 20 minutes if you smoke gank and get 2 or 3 pick offs you're in a great position to take Roshan uncontested and then transition that into a 1 or 2 tower push.

At 2/3k you rarely ever see a smoke bought for starters, and generally people just don't listen to anyone else on the team unless you get extremely lucky. Even though I'm spamming ROSH ROSH ROSH, nobody fucking does it. That's the biggest obstacle. 




 No synergy? Did you miss the part where his Astral gives you invulnerability for 4 seconds and it only takes 3 to reduce your Blink cooldown after taking damage? That seems pretty damn good to me. 




 The first few times I got ganked by 3+, Astral'd myself and Blinked away were very nice feelings. 

It makes you almost as elusive as a Puck. I don't know the interaction if, for example, Alchemist puts a Acid Spray under you. I'm assuming you wouldn't be able to blink fast enough so in that situation a Force would be better. Maybe it depends on the game, but I'm just surprised I've never seen anyone do it. 




 See when I play mid or carry, I hold a 500+ gpm over 80% of the time, even when I lose. Looking at your last hits and gpm/xpm my stats are essentially the same.

I guess the difference is consistency? If I don't have a 500+ gpm every game I'll never get high skill? 




 Assuming you have full mana on every Orb attack as well, though.

I just personally think for the same price, the Blink gives far superior utility than the little bit of damage and lesser mobility you get with a Force. 




 Copied from above:

Force gives 130 mana. At level 1 Orb, this increases your Orb attack by 7.8, at level 4 Orb it increases your Orb attack by 11.7.

That's not really much to write home about in later portions of the game, considering you usually max Orb last (I usually put a value point in just to have, but I always max Astral and Aura first). It might be a nice little boost right when you get it, but I still think the effectiveness of Blink outweighs that heavily.

It might be a nice little boost right when you get it, but I still think the effectiveness of Blink outweighs that heavily.

As far as the item slots, if you start with a Null and pooled tangos, you'll use the tangos and get Bottle, then Treads. So you're at Null, Bottle, Treads, TP Scroll. You have two slots left. Blink and another Null fills that until you can sell a Null for whatever you build next (Scythe, Aghs, Shivas), and that extra Null gives you 6 Int, plus other stats as well for a fraction of the cost of a Force.

 




 It could still be as useful for initiation as a Blink, but nowhere near as useful for escaping. If the enemy team has Dust, if you try to Astral and Shadow Blade out, you're just going to get dusted and killed.

As opposed to Blink, where if you Astral and immediately blink into trees or over a cliff, you can get away much easier. 




  too much damage

10 damage is nothing. You can get 12 damage from 2 Null Talismans, which together only cost 940g. 




 Because against good players the invisibility from Shadow Blade is almost useless. And it costs more. 




 PL isn't the ricing, split pushing rat like the days of old though. You don't really want to spend the whole time farming any more.

PL is a fighter now. You should be fighting as soon as you get your diffusal. Doppelganger doesn't necessarily help you fight like Lance and Rush do. You can have Treads, Vanguard or Vlads, Diffusal by 20 minutes. If you max Lance and Rush, you're going to destroy the enemy team.  




 I know OD is in a pretty shitty spot right now with having a ~5% pick/ban rate for pros in the past 7 months, but it's one of my favorite heroes to play. Recently I had the idea of building Blink Dagger instead of Force Staff. I'm not going to say I invented it, but it isn't something I can remember seeing anyone else do.

Force Staff has been considered core on him for as long as I can remember. It gives you 10 Int and a bit of mobility on a 20 sec CD for 2250 gold. Dotabuff matches played this month with Force Staff: 828,013. Win rate: 45.77%

Compare this to blink dagger, widely considered one of the best items in the game for almost every hero. Same exact price as Force Staff, but much better mobility on only a 12 second CD. Plus it is a far more reliable initiation tool, as well as escape mechanism. If you Astral yourself, at max level, it is 4 seconds. Blink damage CD is only 3 seconds. You will be able to reset your blink cooldown while inside Astral and give yourself a far better chance of evading death than with the Force Staff. Dotabuff matches played this month with Blink Dagger: 26,988. Win rate: 56.90%

Obviously you can't go by dotabuff winrates for everything, but I'm wondering why nobody else does this? Especially considering this month more people picked up Shadow Blades on OD than a Blink Dagger. BlinkAstral is almost equivalent to Nightmare and Disruption as far as an initiation tool, and is great for saving teammates that also have Blink Daggers because of the cooldown reset.

Does anyone agree? Is there some piece of the puzzle I'm missing? 

Also, what would make this hero viable in competitive play again? The consensus seems to be changing his Aghs upgrade. If you changed the Aghs upgrade to Pure damage, and maybe re-scaled it a little bit, would that be enough? 

He's still a mid dominator against popular mid heroes in this meta. Take Shadow Fiend for example. Astral reduces an enemies total mana pool by 52/91/130/169. If you're able to continuously get Astrals off on the SF in lane, he's not going to have enough mana for Razes, and you'll be able to cs far easier, effectively shutting him down without the use of support rotations.

Thoughts? 




 I said I was agreeing with you. I think he's viable.

I'm saying as a general rule, there is a difference between pubstomping and pro competitive. 




  but that dopple is critical for farming.

It should be worth noting that the only reason Doppelganger is good for farming is that it can essentially work as a pseudo-blink. Purge was talking about this in a recent cast, I believe it was Starladder Secret v LC Game 2.

One of your illusions does 0 damage, the other only does 20%. If you're doing 100 damage, that means the Doppelganger illusions are only increasing your total damage by 20. 

IMO you should max Rush and Lance first, keeping Doppelganger at level 1 to be used solely as an escape, unless you are under tons of pressure in which case you may need the reduced cooldown. 




 I agree with you, and see your edit, however keep in mind there is a big difference between pubstomping (even at high skill) and pro competitive. 




 I don't know how many people know this, but when the hero selection screen shows up (where you can scroll through all the heroes horizontally), if you type the letters of the hero name, it will auto scroll to that hero. So when it loads, if you type S-N it will go to Sniper and you can lock it in. 
























  ascending to power levels 

It'd have to be a really massive power level though.

Maybe over 9000? 




 60% of the people I get queued with on US E don't even speak English. Mic is actually less useful than alt clicking most of the time. 




 No. It only records 1 report per game. This is to prevent stacks from using 3-4 reports on one person with the intention of immediately putting them into Low Priority, whether the reason is justified or not. 




 Well in fairness a deso isn't exactly a high priority Lina item. Yeah it works but there are better items you should go for first. 




 Randoming is fine if done correctly and by someone that can play every hero well. Your team picked a support and a core than can function in multiple lanes and nobody has other heroes highlighted? Go ahead and random. 99% of the time your pick will be fine. And if it gets countered, well it was possible that whatever hero you would have picked anyway could have just as easily been countered. Nobody is willing to first pick a hero and the timer is almost at 0? Go ahead and random. The team has to then build around you (hopefully they do) regardless of whether you randomed or not.

Your team picked 4 cores? Don't fucking random. 




 Please format this better. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to read a gigantic wall of text. Paragraphs are your friend. 




 To touch on the muting part, I never report for communication abuse. The last thing I want is a muted player still playing ranked games and being on my team again. I report for Intentionally Feeding so if someone else does as well, they get Low Priority.

Am I abusing the system? Yeah probably. Oh well. They deserve it for being asshats. 




 I randomed as 2nd or 3rd pick on the team every game last night and am on a 6 game winning streak.

Randoming is fine if you do it smartly and can play all of the heroes to the level of the bracket you're in. 

Team picked a support and a core than can function in multiple lanes? Random your pick. 99% of the time you'll be able to lane it somewhere without a problem, and the bonus gold at the start gives you a nice edge.

Team picked 4 cores and you haven't picked yet? Don't fucking random. 




 BoTs, Shivas, Hex, Aghs, Refresher, Blink/Force. Which do you remove for Skadi?  




 Nobody wants a 2.9k scrub on their team though. Which is unfortunate because the biggest thing I want to do in this game is actually play with a tryhard 5 stack. I've stacked with IRL friends before but they usually use the time to mess around and troll the other team instead of playing to win. 




 My opinion is that if you're playing for fun you should play unranked, and if you're playing to win you should play ranked. Obviously people will disagree with me, but that's how I've always felt in video games.

There's two different sides of matchmaking for a reason. Ranked should be for tryhards, unranked should be for casuals, practice or experimentation (most of the time).

IMO.  




 I'm seeing the midas/aghs rush in high 2k as well. 

And I usually have a good enough ability to recognize what the team needs and can pick a hero I'm good at to fit the situation. I went up 200 MMR by spam picking Troll the past couple days but playing the same exact hero every game, especially one so overpowered right now, gets boring and feels like cheating. 




  However, some consistency is gained around mid-to-high 2k imo. By consistency I mean courier is bought at the start of the game.

Made me lol.

Played a position 4 Spirit Breaker (randomed it first or second pick) this past game. I ended up having to buy courier and every set of wards because the Techies refused to support. We eventually won though so that's what matters I guess. 




  Skull Basher on Sniper is actually a legit build

How? The only feasible option I can see for that being legit is having the bash chance, which is lower for ranged heroes, and we were playing against a PA. So he should have saved up for a MKB instead. I guess Basher gives you 114 health too but that's not worth spending 3k gold on as a sniper.

And if he was planning to build it into Abyssal I see the worth there if he gets jumped on, but realistically it should not be a go to item at all. 




 Probably. But in every sport or game, the best way to get better is to play against, and also sometimes with, people of higher skill than you. 

Not saying I want to consistently play at 5k, but I want to try out a few casual games to see how I do. 




 Is that so? Because I just checked datdota for every available patch and 0 results came up.

Care to share which game? I'd like to see the outcome. 




 I wish there was a way I could just play a few games at 4 or 5k in some kind of practice mode or unranked so I don't drag down people's MMR if I'm the reason for a loss.

I feel like I have the game knowledge and game sense to perform well as a support or member of the team, it's just my mechanics of last hitting aren't up to par with their level to be able to adequately farm well enough to carry a game. 




 He played like he should have realistically. He sat in the back with MoM on and attacked people like he should have. But I made sure to pop BKB and go for him as soon as I saw him every time, especially if MoM was active. 

It wasn't exactly his fault because I played the way I was supposed to, and in a way that countered him. And that's what you need to do against people that build MoMs. If you see it, blow them up. If you ignore it, you get blown up. 




 I know things like this get posted all the time, and this actually isn't a "complaining about my teammates" kind of thread.

I've played between 1.8k and 3.2k MMR over the past year and a half. Currently sitting at 2.9k.

Back when I was sub 2k, people knew nothing and at that time myself included. 10cs at 15 minutes, running into 3 enemy heroes solo, facepalm worthy item builds, etc. 

When I hit 2.5k, it was a bit better. Usually 3 out of 5 of your team knew for the most part what they were doing or how to play the hero they chose decently. There was always the bad egg or two every game that still seemed completely clueless though.

When I popped over 3k, it seemed like for the most part it got better. People knew to farm instead of face rushing enemies at 10 minutes. People could actually land skill shots, knew to TP away instead of just feeding, etc. But I'm still finding absolute retards in most games. Last night, at 2.9k, our Sniper bought a Skull Basher. People still run into a jungle blind looking for a gank and get mad when they die 1v4 because the other team TP'd to a tower and counter ganked. 

I'm nowhere near a perfect or pro player and I know that. Obviously we all have bad games where we get off to a shitty start and can't quite bring it back around. But I don't pick heroes I'm uncomfortable with or don't know how to correctly play, and that's still what I'm seeing even in high 2k. The game I just got out of, our Clinkz flamed the enemy Tidehunter for hacking because he didn't know Orchid didn't do an immediate instance of damage and Tide was able to Blink out before Clinkz could land the first arrow on him (our Clinkz was Russian though so that could also explain his toxic nature.)

My questions would be, assuming I can continue to rise in MMR, when will I see consistently a full team of people that actually know what they're doing all the time? When does the game become more of winning as a coordinated team rather than who has less noobs, for lack of a better word? When can I actually rely on my teammates to make good decisions and play well by themselves instead of feeling the need to be the captain/coach the entire game? 




  IMO it doesn't do that too much.

The MoM Sniper against my PA last game would beg to differ. 




 Sniper will be outputting the most damage on their team. He is usually the #1 priority. The way to beat a Sniper is to take him out of the fight first. If you're letting him get away with barely any HP, then it's your fault for not completing the kill. 

He's annoying to play against, I agree. Just like every high dps hero though, the key is to pressure him early and gank him when he's trying to farm solo. It requires teamwork. An unfarmed Sniper is a useless Sniper. 




  where someone on my team had above 6k mmr. 

 




 There are gap-closers that you can pick that don't require Blink daggers though. Clock, PA, QoP, Pudge (lol), Tusk, just to name 5. 

If you do require a blink, there is almost always an angle you can use to get in close. Obviously you can't just face rush into him because he'll see you. Use fog of war to your advantage, or use a smoke to get behind him. 

You're making it seem like it's impossible to get on top of him. With good play by the Sniper it's by no means easy, but it's not impossible. 




 I've found the opposite to be true. Especially in 2k where you can go up against some absolutely retarded offlane combinations that make your life a living hell.

For example I played a Tiny game yesterday expecting a Batrider solo offlane, but the Sven went with him and maxed Cleave. So they just pushed the wave into the tower and continuously dove me after level 2. It blew. Even with a Magic Stick.

edit: We ended up winning the game fine and everything, and I suppose we did break even on the lane because their dives lead to a couple deaths on their end even though they killed me as well. It just made farming an absolute bitch of a time. 




  His isnt top 10 for anything.

Sprint makes him move at almost max move speed with boots. Maybe three other heroes have an ability similar.

He has an really good AoE stun/slow on an 8 sec CD.

Built in Bash.

His ult reduces enemy hero's armor more than all but 1 spell in the game (Weave) and also gives True Sight on a 5 sec CD costing only 25 mana.

Pro teams are picking him.

 There are so many heroes far better than him at the moment.

There will always be heroes better than other heroes in some situations and worse in others. Slardar fills a certain role (as every hero is intended to), and that role is to essentially to amplify damage onto a single target and allow them to be instantly bursted down. 

He's fine. 




  Make his ult a skillshot with aoe

Why have I never seen this suggested? Holy shit that would be awesome. 

1. It would make the hero far more interesting because you will actually be sniping people instead of just clicking on them at 3000 range and it auto hits them.

2. All of the noobs who pick him and press R to win would actually need to get a little bit of skill in order to use the hero to max potential.  




 Shrapnel does a lot less late game than it does in the laning stage though. If your 3 cores have BKBs, Shrapnel is useless unless he's throwing it on supports. He could also hold onto the charges in case the enemy team is trying to run away after maybe losing the fight and play clean up, but that's not overpowered that's just smart play. 




  the fact you think im a dick makes you a complete dick, and now ill start trolling just like you and your buddy ellran.

This is why you get reported every game. They aren't even trolling. They're completely correct. 

/thread 




  No other combo can beat this combo at early game.

Omniknight + anything. Position yourself well, ward the jungle so the CM can't just run behind you, if CM freezes your carry just Repel him.

Lane won. 




  please help

I'll contact the authorities post-haste.  




 Slardar is fine. 




  I think taking away the vision that shrapnel gives would be a fair way to ~~balance the hero~~ nerf him completely into the ground. 




 Not going to watch the replay, but being in 2k he's just butthurt you stomped him. 




  you will be out of the "toxic" bracket soon enough right?

The only way to get out of the toxic bracket is to uninstall and play something else. 




 Teammate sees lowest MMR person.

Abandons immediately.

Game doesn't count.

I'm fine with that. 




  ruined a game for ~~9~~ 4 other people.

The winning team is grateful for abandons in Ranked usually. Free MMR. 




 Have two different accounts. The first was calibrated at 1.8k in 2013, highest I rose was 3.2k in a year's playing time before a massive losing streak, turning 21 (drunk dota is bad dota) and general discouragement/giving up in games dropped me down to around 2.4k. Don't think I've touched that account in months. 

Made another account, calibrated at 2.6k a month or so ago, sitting at 2.8k at the moment.

Which account? 




 At level 2 with Warcry you run at 330 ms. That's faster than every hero without boots except Ench (335) and Luna (330).

Sven can get a Soul Ring with the same timing as an Earthshaker, probably even earlier considering ES's usually don't spend their first levels doing pulls whereas a Sven could. He only needs level 8 as a support to have the skills you really want. Hell, you could even leave the stun at level 1 if you don't need the damage from it, considering the stun duration and cooldown remain the same at all levels and put points into stats to increase your mana pool if you're that concerned about it. 




  far enough to away to harras and too far for viper to hit you

TA's Attack Range = 140 + 60/120/180/240 depending on level of Psi Blades.

Viper's Attack Range = 575

All Viper has to do is stand on the creeps and orb walk you. You've never played this lane have you?  




 I was playing Viper. 




 You only need Soul Ring to be effective as a support early game. Storm Hammer has a longer cast range, longer stun duration and does the same damage as Magic Missile, for example. Skip Cleave and Ult. At level 2 you get the stun and a 12% Move Speed Bonus and +4 armor in an AoE around you. Buy a couple Clarities to support the buff until Soul Ring.

 




  TA

Viper destroys TA in lane. 




 Hm. That's basically just Eblade excluding the dot.

What about an item that upon cast (Point Target, Unit Target?) creates an AoE root effect. Sort of like an Overgrowth but with a fast projectile? Atos is 3100, GS is 1600 so maybe make the recipe cost 1000 for a 5700 total cost? 




 A 6k lost mid to a 4k? Please post dotabuff so we can laugh at him. 




 Definitely Weaver. I know exactly how far I can push the limits of the hero before I need to Time Lapse, easy escape with Shukuchi, and is all around just a fun hero to play. 

Also 6.81 Eblade/Dagon5 Tinker. I spam picked that and went up like 500 MMR. It was great. I still consider him top 3 but he's not as much fun to play any more.

And I have a 70% winrate with Bloodseeker over 68 games because he was the first one I really learned how to play over a year ago but I don't really pick him any more because he's so fucking easy to play now. 




 It's easier to win playing as a great carry with a shitty support than a great support with a shitty carry for the most part. 

A game this morning ended up with our Sniper building a Skull Basher. I wanted to cry. 




 The most annoying thing is when your team is balanced and the enemy team just picks 5 cores or 4 cores and a greedy support, you dominate the first 25 minutes but can't finish that early and the comeback mechanics give their cores an item each after a team fight and then you lose because you're trying to fight into a fucking Sven, PA, WK, Tinker and Batrider that suddenly got an influx of 2.5k gold each.

Fuck that. 




 Played a game earlier where our Lina would Euls the enemy carry during our LC's duel insisting "it's the combo for my stun."

I face palmed so hard I actually hurt myself. 




 It could be 50%. I doubt it, but it's possible. The title is

 Lets talk about Aghs Treant in Pro games

Well I'm talking about it. 




 Alchemist would literally never be picked even moreso than now. Nobody would play a hero where if you die you give MORE gold to the enemy team than you already do. That's asking to be ganked every time you show your face out of the fountain because you're a walking money pool. 




 It could work as a niche last pick. 

Out of the 25 most popular heroes in 6.83 pro games according to datdota, the only ones with innate tree clearing abilities are Rubick (Telekinesis breaks trees upon landing), Venge (Swap destroys trees), Slark (Pounce destroys trees where he lands), Batrider (Firefly), Storm Spirit (Ball Lightning), Ember Spirit (Fire Remnant) and Io (Tether). If you bump it up to top 50 it only adds Lina (LSA) , Enigma (Midnight Pulse), Phoenix (Dive, Sun Ray destroys trees he moves over, and Supernova destroys trees in the radius upon casting), Jakiro (Macropyre) and Beastmaster (Wild Axes). 

13 out of 50 are fine odds for me considering the level of effort some of those heroes would require to do it without a QB and gem.

I don't know that I agree with dumping tens of thousands of net worth into a Treant Protector safe lane farmer, but it could be a pocket strat. 




 Absolutely not. Then you would just get griefers who buy courier and disable the rest of the team from using it. 

Every player would then basically have to buy their own courier. 




 Someone in my 2.8k game last night was adamant about picking Treant for safe lane hard carry farmer. Claimed he was going to rush Aghs to farm the entire map and then Mjollnir because Treant is so high dps.

Although it theoretically could work, we had serious doubts about trusting someone to actually pull that off and he picked AM. We still won so I guess it ended up okay. 




 So don't pick him into lineups that have those heroes? Problem solved. 




  i'm peruvian

RIP my sides. 




 If only the last pick jungle midas juggernaut I had the misfortune of playing with last night could read this. 




  For each enemy hero that dies in X range of alchemist, he will gain a charge

 that when an enemy heroes dies in X range of alchemist, the rubber band effect is ignored and consumes a charge

So it does absolutely nothing? 




 You're not exactly supposed to win the lane against Viper, he's a lane dominator. He's one of the heroes you just need to shut down early. An unfarmed or underleveled viper is useless. 




 Troll absolutely destroys Sniper. If he's 1k MMR all he has to do is build Shadow Blade.  




 Pick Troll Warlord. If they try to go on you, go melee mode, pop your melee whirling axes so they get a miss chance, pop ult and murder them.

Also he's overpowered. 




 Really now?

There are only about 580 players on the Dota 2 Leaderboards showing at over 6k MMR. Europe ends its 200 player leaderboard at 6172, and China ends its at 6017. Americas and SE Asia drop to 5.7k MMR and 5.5k MMR in the top 200 respectively. Let's just do a math's sake assumption and estimate 11,000 players above 5k MMR even though that number is probably way more than the actual total, but I highly doubt less. And I think it's safe to assume that every pro is above 5k.

So what you're suggesting is that there are 4,389,000 people between 3.0 and 4.9k MMR (top 60th percentile being at 3k would mean there are 4.4 million over 3k, then subtracting out the 11,000 over 5k). The top 90th percentile in Dec 2013 consisted of 500,000 players. The top 90th percentile now would consist of 1.1 million players (if we round the current number up to 11 million). 

11,000 of those people (by these numbers) are above 5k. So 1.089 million out of the 4.39 million we need to find the top 10% are somewhere in the 3.0k MMR and 4.9k MMR range. If 5k+ only holds 11,000 players, that means 5k+ is roughly the 99.9th percentile. Meaning 3k-4.9k would consist of 39.9% of the player base, or slightly less than 4.4 million players. We already know that isn't true, because of the relatively common occurrence of MMR discrepancies you find even in 4k, where teams queuing can have a difference of up to 500 MMR (and sometimes more) between their respective highest and lowest MMR players, whereas if you're queuing at anywhere from 2-3k you're hard pressed to have that difference be more than 50. 

We can assume the players that were above 3k in Dec 2013 are still above 3k. What you're suggesting, again, is that in the span of 15 months, instead of 500,000 out of 5 million players being above roughly 3k MMR, there are 3.9 million NEW PLAYERS out of 11 million (4.4 million or 40% minus the existing 500,000) above 3k MMR. I have no idea how many of them have MOBA experience in the past, but I highly doubt that almost two thirds of the 6 million are above the skill level that would have put them in the top 10% of players only a year ago, also taking into account that a very generous number of the people playing Dota 2 in 2013 were most likely people with previous Dota and MOBA experience, already making them more skilled than someone who heard about it for the first time when its popularity took a meteoric rise. It was released for public beta in 2011. In the 2 years up to these stats being released, it'd accrued 5 million players. That number doubled in the next 12 months. 

The skill difference between a 3k player and 4k player is very noticeable. The reason for that is the lower number of players in that range. Go between 2k and 3k and you don't notice as much of a difference, although yes the difference is definitely still there.

If I had to make an educated guess, the 99th percentile (top 110,000 players) would be 4500 and the 90th percentile (top 1.1 million players) would still be somewhere in the 3k range, probably close to 3750 on the high end. I'd place the 60th at 2200 honestly. Popularity doesn't bring masters. Popularity brings casuals. The masters are the ones who've been playing this for years, and they're the ones that fill the top percentiles. Obviously there are cases where someone picked it up and excelled immediately, but that's not every player.

I calibrated ranked around December 2013 immediately at level 13. Never even heard of Dota previously except for a friend mentioning that he played it and got me to install it and try it out. I obviously knew jack shit about the game, and was quite terrible even after so many games. Got put at 1.8k. I looked through some of those games a little while back, and it was plainly obvious how terrible I was, in le reddits opinion, from my builds and stats and just remembering how I used to play. And yet back then I was almost of equivalent skill as the average player.

I'm sorry but there's no way almost half of the player base is over 3k MMR.

  




 This is anecdotal, but a game I played a couple hours ago ended up my team winning 63-26 in 38 minutes. 

We were messing around at the end with a couple lanes of racks down and 3 players on 7 kill streaks or higher (it was a massive stomp for us from the get go) and we got team wiped. 

2 of their heroes were able to buy full hearts in the span of the 2 minutes it took to get back to their ancient. 5 people on a godlike streak should only give 5k gold, right? Considering a godlike streak after 30 minutes usually gives 1k to a player maximum? 

2 of their players ended up with at least 5.5k each. Seems a bit stupid to me. 




 I don't remember when I was below 2k, but in the past week he's gotten picked or at least locked at first in a decent number of games. 




 I like to think of it as ONLY 2 million out of the 11 million are better. Makes me feel less bad. 




 10% of 10 million (rounding down from the 10,948,367 currently on the home screen) is 1 million.

If you're in the top 90%, you're above 9 million people.

1% of 10 million (again rounding down for math's sake) is 100,000. If you're in the top 99% you're above 9,900,000 people.

It's basic math. 




 Is it just me or have Russians abandoned US E? I haven't seen a toxic Russian in months. It's all South Americans now.  




 Ursa jungle gets picked every 5 games or so in upper 2k unless you manage to convince them otherwise. It's annoying. 




 I hope they update that sometime soon. With the total only 50,000 away from 11 million unique players last month it would be really interesting to see if the numbers changed at all. 

It's also crazy to think that if I'm 3.0k I'm "better" than over 9 million people at this game.

And then I remember that there are probably over a million people who use their mouse to click their spells instead of using hotkeys. 




  the STANDARD in an RTS ,which dota is, is NOT WASD.

And yet the default camera control in Dota 2 is WASD.

Bye Felicia. 




  Depends on what style you came from.

Do you know how to read? If you're coming from a FPS then you're used to and comfortable with WASD. WASD is far more common over every PC game than mouse movement. It's considered the standard and default (hence why it's defaulted to WASD in Dota 2) movement controls for PC games. Games that use mouse movement as default are the minority. Do games have an option to use mouse movement instead? Yes. But the standard is WASD. 




  I have played 

Third person games use Edge Pan, First Person use WASD. Depends on what style you came from. WoW, for example, is 3rd person but also uses WASD. So it's definitely still common. 




 Playing on US E helps me learn Spanish, so I guess it's not all bad.

On a serious note though, it's actually really stupid that I queue for US E and have to ask "English?" at the start of a game to see if I'm going to be able to communicate. 




  have no clue why would someone use something like that.

Pretty much every PC game uses WASD as the default player/camera movement. I can't think of a game I have played where it's been different as the default. Therefore, it's what people are most likely most comfortable with if you've been PC gaming for longer than playing Dota 2.
 




 I made a thread about this the other day. The consensus I got was that those 4 extra keys are used for your control groups to make micro'ing easier. 

Personally, I've only been playing Dota 2 for a year and a half. Before that I used WASD for movement of some kind in every game for the past 7 years of online gaming. It's muscle memory at this point. I have absolutely no problem changing up my hotkeys a bit and reaching the two inches with my index finger to hit another key, especially being a hardcore WoW player for 4 years where your spells required you to hit 1 through = on a consistent basis.

You can try it out, but it's not going to magically make you a better player if you're not comfortable with it. In fact, you're going to have to spend a lot of time getting used to it and you'll be worse until you do.  




 It's about half and half. The South Americans are the worst usually as far as significantly stupid things 




 If its an Aghs upgrade though, its 4200 gold and an item slot. If you think about a late game sniper running Phase, Mjoll, Daed, Bfly, Mkb, MoM for example that's a fuckton of damage. But is replacing any of those really worth it? I mean I guess you can ditch the MoM, but I probably wouldn't.

And if he needs BKB in the game, that's definitely not worth it. 




 People do stupid things in literally every game I play in. I don't think that really applies. 




  since he has a tool to cancel them on his own

Only if he knows where they are. If you blink out of fog there's nothing he can do. 




 It's already in the game. Lifestealer Infest allows you to control a creep. 




 That's actually not that bad. The mana cost is 175/275/375, and aside from Skadi nothing he builds increasing his int. Add in another 150 mana if you use all 3 Shrap charges, it's not like he's going to get more than 2 off in a fight anyway. 




 Spam picked Troll last night, went 9-2 with the longest win only being a 38 minute game in upper 2k MMR.

This hero's retarded. I died 3 times mid lane before 10 minutes in two of the wins. All it takes is level 11 and an Alpha Wolf to solo Rosh and suddenly you're unstoppable. Proceeded to end the game 25 minutes later on a Godlike streak in both of them.

1 loss came from our entire team just getting massively outplayed, the other was a poorly taken fight that resulted in 5 deaths and only me having buyback and we got gg pushed.
 




  Can we please fix the Sand King bot?

Silly me how could I have forgotten. I'll get right on that for you. 




 Like someone else said, if you're upper 4k you should try joining a semi-pro team or league or something. 

I would love the opportunity to try that out because I play so much fucking better if I have a supportive team around me that cooperates with a game plan rather than playing completely solo, but nobody wants a 2.8k scrub on their team even if I offer to play support :( 

There are so many games I could have won if the 4 randoms on my team would have pushed towers or taken Roshan after a team fight rather than going back to farm. But usually the way it goes is 2 don't speak English, 1 is trying to go for the highest GPM instead of the win and the other is a toxic feeder. But that's Dota pubs for you. 




 Slark is a hero that I haven't seen mentioned that absolutely shits on Sniper. Build Shadow Blade and run around ganking him. 

Any hero with Blink initiation is great against him. Axe and Batrider come to mind. 

The key to shutting him down completely is to wreck him early game. An unfarmed Sniper is still slightly annoying, but nowhere near as much of a threat as you'd think.

If he gets farmed, ignore the team around him and kill him first in team fights. He will output the most damage on their team if left to his own devices, and he's extremely squishy because normally people build him like a glass cannon. 




 Battle Fury should not usually be used as a damage item. It is a farming accelerator. Some heroes benefit from the Cleave effect in team fights (Ember Spirit using SoF, or Jug using Omnislash for example) but you really don't build this item for the damage at all.

It's core on AM because it accelerates his farm and makes him one of the fastest farming heroes in the game. It's core on Ember because of the synergy with SoF. Situationally, you can build one on PA as well to accelerate your farm and cleave massive crits. Not many heroes really should build this item though. 

People build it on Kunkka as well, for reasons I can understand but can't adequately explain (something something double cleave effect idk).  
 




 So I live in Cincinnati, which is 2 hours away from Columbus and I really want to go to this.

Anyone have a website link or something with information? Do you need to prebuy tickets or anything? Google isn't helping much. 




 Eh Sniper is okay I think. Shrapnel is his only skill that MAYBE could use a tiny nerf because it's ridiculous in the lane but eh.

Troll on the otherhand is fucking retarded. I spam picked him the past two days and went 11-2. Base movement speed dropped by 10 is needed. Maybe increasing the cooldown on his ult by 10-20 seconds as well because if you have any enemy T2 down and you win a team fight, its pretty much instant racks regardless of enemy buyback timers.

Or just remove his built-in bash. He gets a free 3k gold item on a hero that every 30 seconds attacks at near max attack speed. I think removing the bash would make him trash tier in people's eyes though, which is usually what you want to avoid. 




 Could be that I've gotten better I guess. I don't know, I've bounced a couple times between 2.5 and 3.0 in the span of a week or two and I didn't notice it. 




 Didn't say they were bad. That's just their style of play half the time in 2k bracket. If two teams disregard farm and just kill each other, the winning team still gets +25 MMR. 




 Once you hit 2.5k pretty much everyone knows you need to farm, unless you're playing US E at bad hours where you get all South Americans that stop farming at 8 minutes and just start running at you.

 




 People ask how to improve MMR to get out of 2k.

I gave them the solution.

Kappa. 




 I've played from 1.8k to 3.2k.

I barely notice a difference between 2.5 and 3.0 




 That's a good suggestion as well.

Or just pick Troll. I've won 5 out of 6 with him today even though I got "shut down" in the laning stage. 

It's stupid. All he needs is Aquila/Phase/HoD and an alpha wolf to solo Rosh, then you group up and push. If the enemy team fights you, you win the fight unless you're extremely outplayed considering you have to blow cooldowns on an Aegis Troll or he'll annihilate your team, creating space for the rest of your team to come in and clean up, and if they don't fight you you just mow down two lanes with Battle Trance.

Rinse and repeat two more times, gg 35 minutes. 




 This was a tongue in cheek post to mock everyone always asking how to get out of the trench, while also pointing out the problem that the hero is plain overpowered right now. 




  Kappa

 




 Why farm when you can pick a hero that has a 30 sec CD ult only countered by Omniknight and mow down towers to end a game in 30 minutes?

Kappa, but it's also true. 




 Not necessarily. The skill difference between 2.5k and 3.0k is hardly noticeable. If you spam pick Troll, win 20 games and jump 500 MMR, you're probably not going to drop like a rock afterwards. 




 Well, people at 5k for example are generally skilled enough to deal with a Troll. At 2k, you will rarely find a game where all 5 players know how to deal with a Troll, not to mention find a game where all 5 players can properly coordinate and execute the playstyle to deal with a troll. 




 Pick Troll Warlord before he's nerfed. He's instant win 90% of the time. 

You're welcome.

ITT: Nobody understands tongue in cheek. 




  Right now lightning storm is pretty useless

80/140/200/260 nuke and a mini slow on a 4 sec CD. It's arguably his best spell considering Edict is situational, Pulse Nova is situational, and his stun isn't always reliable unless you have a setup. 




 I was in a game earlier where I mic'd up to tell the mid SF (who spoke English and had been typing previously) that Spirit Breaker was charging mid.

He responds by flaming me saying he doesn't use sound and I should have pinged instead. He proceeded to feed the rest of the game, even after I switched to pings. I hate people. 




 Darude - Sandstorm 




 I want to know what they base those "random" surveys on after some games are over. "Did you enjoy playing with ___ player" or whatever they are. Because 90% of those end up being either someone who was flaming the whole match or who was absolutely terrible. I always give them the lowest rating. Not sure what it accomplishes, but it makes me feel better. 




 I'm pretty sure every bracket is equally toxic. 




 Okay. 




 You're talking about someone in 750 MMR you dip shit. If they're 750 MMR, obviously they don't farm fast. 

And you're also talking about someone who, if they knew how to farm heroes already, would be doing so. But you know what the biggest mistake of low MMR tiers is? Not farming! Ask anyone in this subreddit and they'll tell you the same thing. Avoid fights early on, get a gold advantage, and then go killing.

Your suggestion is completely wrong. 




 A snowball hero doesn't snowball without basic items. You need to farm for those. 20 minutes of good farm on these heroes compared to fighting for the first 15 and you'll dominate. You must be new.

lel 




 At 750 MMR the only thing you need to do is play a snowball hero and outfarm the enemy team. DO NOT participate in early team fights. Let your team die around you and focus on farming. 

Practice last hitting in bot matches, get bigger items and levels before everyone else, and make sure you picked a tempo controller (TA, Bloodseeker, Slark, Nightstalker for examples) that can 1v1 win fights against heroes that are out of position. 

The lowest MMR I was ever at was 1.8k when I calibrated a year and a half ago. Don't rely on your team at all. In fact, I'd mute them all and just farm for 20 minutes. Then come out with a higher net worth than everyone on a hero that can 1v2 or 1v3 if needed and massacre them. 




  when in fact they are (generally) of equal skill.

This is the part I don't get. I'm at 3k. Half the people I get queued with make me wonder how they even managed to load up the game in the first place, another 45% seem like your average player, 3% are actually hey you know what the fuck you're doing and then the last 2% are god tier. 

I know a hell of a lot about this game from being active on this subreddit and watching pro gameplays. I can load into a match and tell my team exactly what items to build for situations, when to back in teamfights, what heroes would be best against their lineup or to synergize with ours, etc. The problem is most of the time my team doesn't fucking listen. (Trying to tell my team to take Roshan after winning a team fight when we're behind to reduce our deficit, give us another advantage, and also deny it from the enemy team. My team refuses to listen, the enemy team takes Roshan 10 minutes later and pushes to win. This happens constantly.)

I suppose it's my mechanical skills that aren't up to par with people of higher MMRs, but considering how many people (even carries) I see at 3k just auto attacking creeps or not using items/abilities when they need to I'm baffled that they're considered the same skill level as me.

And then if I manage to carry their 2-14-8 feeding support asses to victory, they rise in MMR and are viewed as higher skilled. Makes sense. 




 You need to get your diffusal before you're useful in any way. I still think he's best as safe lane to secure it asap, but I've been trying him offlane just to see what happens. With Soul Ring he's great at harassing a potentially squishy enemy carry out of lane if the supports rotate away.

I've had a 50/50 split as far as success goes, I've really only played like 6 games so far though. 




 Ideally you let your teammates initiate fights so you're not first target, but still ouputting a really high amount of damage.

I'm still tinkering with it, and not pro by any means.  




 Dagon 5 + Aghs is more fun. 




 Troll needs his base movement speed dropped by 10 and the health bonus halved during Berserker's Rage in my opinion. That won't kill the hero in any way, but it'll make him more balanced.

Axe...just fuck Axe. I hate that hero. No hero should be able to continuously creep cut your safe lane with a Stout Shield and RoP at level 2. It's fucking retarded. Especially if he has another hero with any kind of disable with him. You're just fucked unless it's a low skilled player. Change the scaling of his Counter Helix from 100/135/170/205 to 50/115/175/205 and it might be alright. Or cut down his starting health a bit.  




 I've been running him offlane recently. Starting out with RoP, 4xTangos, 1xSalve, 2xggbranches. 

Soul Ring, Treads, Diffusal, Vlads, Manta, Skadi, gg. 




  Why isn't Kunkka picked more then?

Because he's not overpowered like Axe or Troll currently are. 




  Visage

Since when? 




 [Logitech M510](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BcyeIQuSL.jpg)

2 buttons on the left side, I've only hotkeyed one so far and it's my microphone key. I don't use open mic because my mic is a piece of shit and I have background noise, so this makes it a hell of a lot easier than somewhere on the keyboard.

I think they're fine to use. It's the same logic as buying $100 headphones to play first person shooters. Whatever gives you the advantage over your opponent. 
























  we can came much closer to lol

Pretty sure nobody cares about or wants that. If they wanted to play LoL, they'd play LoL. 




 It's 7 minutes already. If it started at 7 and increased as the game progressed, how would you scale that? 

1 minute extra per 10 minutes of game time would lead to buybacks being 12 minutes at 50 minutes. But people rarely buy back in the first 30 of the game anyway. The only reason they do is to get immediately back into an engagement to turn the tide for their team, which is the opposite of what OP is talking about. And that extra 5 minutes isn't really anything.

 




 Aghs Tinker and BF SB are really the only things I see wrong with this. Having faith that his Perseverence is for a Linkens and not Refresher.

No supports on the Dire but that happens in every bracket. 




 No. 




  buy a force staff and push me into a pudge hook or something

I've done similar things unintentionally just trying to be helpful. Oh shit the carry got arrowed, I have a Force Staff, I'll save him! Oh...he was facing the enemies...my bad. 




  The bad thing in that style of gameplay is that it needs skilled team and people willing to co-operate, both lacking from 90% of pub players. 

Not strategies, just specific heroes.

I basically learned how to play Puck from watching s4 do it and then trying him out in pubs after I saw how it was done. Now I laugh at the 3k Pucks that choose him and don't orb over cliffs to escape ganks, or phase shift Assassinates, etc. 

Just an example. You'll also learn what builds are appropriate for what situations from the casters (assuming you're watching good ones) and why. It's something you'll eventually learn by playing, but I learned way faster watching vods.

I never played a game like Dota before this. Closest I came was 4 years of World of Warcraft. My initial calibration when I calibrated back in October 2013 was 1.8k. Rose to 2.2k or so over the next year, but completely stagnated. Since then I've risen to 3.1k, and I can attest a ton of it to watching tournament vods. 




 We know. 




 From what I've seen in my pubs LC is amazing against Crystal Maiden. However, the other 4 heroes shit stomp her. 




 Pretty much this. Everyone knew that after Puppey left NaVi just wasn't going to be the same.  




 Empire taking a (albeit former) NaVi player? Is it April Fools Day or something? 




 Earth Spirit wrecks every hero provided you actually can play him to his full capabilities. I've never tried to learn him, but apparently up in 4-5k he's absolute hell to play against. 




 Currently it's FL!P. This is taken from my handle in pretty much all of my other games which is Candy Flip. A Candy Flip is when you do LSD and MDMA at the same time. Really fun to do, and Candy Flip is a pretty sweet name. Came up with FL!P because there are some people I don't exactly want to explain a drug reference to, and the exclamation point instead of the i is kind of like flipping the i over. I dig it. 




 Probably my favorite Brit song. Womanizer is up there too though. Upvote. 




 She's picked often. Teams usually wait until 4th or 5th pick to get her because if you pick her up too early it gives away your plan and it can be countered. The downside to that is she is also often banned in the last stages because pro teams can see what you're going for and how she would fit into it, and ban her. 




 I learned more from watching pro games than I ever would have learned by just playing the game.

You see pros playing heroes to their full capability. When you see it done, you can replicate it with some practice. If you're 1k, 2k, 3k even MMR you'll rarely see a hero played to it's fullest. 




 Shadow Demon is a support I might start picking against Troll. Disruption/Force Staff to save an ally, Purge goes through BKB. 

Bane's Fiends Grip can lock him down too provided you position yourself well.

The problem with Troll is you need to 5v1 him. And that means the rest of his team, under the benefit of his ult, destroys your team. 




 The instant Skywrath silence is a bigger counter than Kotl. 




 I use it as a mind game. There have been numerous times where I told the enemy team to gg ff mid and we had 4 heroes smoked off to the side, they went in for racks, we surprised them and 5 wiped them, proceeding to get a bunch of gold from comeback mechanics to eventually win the game.

ez mmr 




 Wraith King is great for a 4-turned-core role. Build an early midas to help get your level 16 and some better farm and you're solid. 




 People always insta pick WR when I pick Troll. Okay she can run away from you, big deal. Build MKB - useless WR. If you even need to.

Lina is great against Troll if you play her well. Her Aghs upgrade destroys him, and you can Euls him or yourself to potentially survive if he goes on you in a teamfight. If he bashes you you're fucking dead though.

 




 Maxing Tide is one of those things where it's not what you SHOULD do, but it works well enough to get away with it. 




 Haha actually you're right, especially if you hit it at a slightly wrong angle and ended up trapped inside of the rubble instead of going through. Happened to me a few times. 




 Roaming with carries is generally a bad idea because you should be using that time to be farming up early items, unless you're in a 4 or 5 core lineup where someone else has farm priority.

The best roaming supports, in my opinion, are Earthshaker, Skywrath, Lion, Lina (if the lane has a setup stun), Venomancer with boots first isn't bad if you land the gale, SD/Bane assuming theres lockdown to follow the Disruption/Nightmare. 




 Pocket Abaddons when I play PA are fucking beautiful. 




 It's Eul's that needs a bit of a nerf, not Lina. She just benefits from it massively.

Her Aghs ult is extremely strong right now. I wouldn't say it's too strong, but it's up there for best Aghs upgrade in the game. 




 Depends on where you're laning him. Tidebringer is insane harassment, but it also pushes the wave extremely hard. 

If you're mid or safe lane, you should max torrent and X for kill potential at 6 in my opinion. If you're safe, you don't want to continuously push the lane, if you're mid you're most likely going up against someone with a bottle that can regen through your harassment.

The Tidebringer max isn't useful except for being extremely fucking annoying to play against, and helping you farm in a way. However, Kunkka isn't a hero that you want to be farming that much realistically. Kunkka doesn't rely on items, he relies on proper usage of his skill combinations. A good Kunkka doesn't need tons of farm to be useful, hence why maxing Tidebringer is just annoying for the other team. 




 Icefrog fucked Necro in pubs by putting a support tag on him on his profile. He's not a support at all. Even though his support tag has been removed, a lot of ignorant players still believe him to be a support because of that reason.

Also any hero with a built in heal and that Mek is core on is automatically a support in trash tier players' eyes. 




 That would be retarded.

I think the pick/ban setup in CM could use adjustment though.

What about 3 bans to start (per team), then 2 picks, 1 ban, 2 picks, 1 ban, 1 pick.

We're seeing the same 4 out of 10 heroes picked in the first phase in over 90% of games. This would mean each team gets to ban another hero before they pick their initial 2.

Just a thought. 




 I'm surprised it took Radiant 64 minutes to win that game. 

2000 MMR? 




 PA/Abaddon/CM. Such a deadly trio. Found this out in a 30 minute stomp last night. We took racks at 20 minutes and Abaddon and I (the PA) didn't leave the enemy base until the game was over. 




 He's easy to play, but takes a lot of practice to play well. The combination of your X Marks ability, Torrent and Ghost Ship will take a lot of positioning knowledge and timing practice to be done correctly. Don't get discouraged if you don't land them immediately.

Also, a neat trick, if you're running a bottle, cast X Marks on yourself, TP to base, and you get a free bottle refill when it brings you back. 




 Yeah that's intended. 




 If I'm in ranked I'm trying to win every game.

I don't play unranked except to practice heroes or different builds. 




 IG is one of my favorite teams to watch, have been since before last years TI.

They were actually my pick to win TI4 in the Compendium, but alas they let me down. 




 It's not complicated.

If the DC happens before first blood, and he does not reconnect in 5 minutes, regardless of if first blood happens, the game will not count.

If the DC happens before first blood, then first blood happens, and he reconnects within five minutes, the game will count.

People are stupid. 




 The idea is that if you pick captain, you should be able to play every hero in the pool/that you draft, so if you draft a hero for yourself but one person on your team can only play that hero out of the others that you drafted, you should let them have it and play another hero.

I think if you're queuing for CM in the first place you should be able to play everything, but that apparently isn't the case. 




  If he doesn't have sceptre up

 A early aghs on Doom is so fucking strong

Learn to read. 




 Most good Dooms are buying Tranquils these days and will start with a RoP. If they're concerned about getting ganked or harassed, they'll devour a Wildwing and get the aura. Between the two of those that's +6 armor, for a total of 7 potentially at level 1.

Have fun. 




 I'm 3k and I actually prefer playing at these hours. Generally the players are less skilled and I can take over a game easier. 

Yesterday morning, maybe around 6 AM, I was Enigma and we had a WD on our team. The game was pretty close, I'd say we were in the lead around 35 minutes but it definitely could have gone either way. WD and I were running away from a team fight that we had just lost, followed closely by the 5 members of their team that had survived. We had a PL that got picked off earlier, that was respawning around this time. Radiant bottom lane, where our T1 used to be, I blinked into the trees, WD tried a juke spot. Our PL repsawned, TP'd into the T2 and started running to help us. Their team split into groups of 2 and 3, the 2 went after WD, who promptly casked and Aghs ulted them to death, and the group of 3 thought I TP'd out, so went after our PL. Luckily for me my Black Hole had just come off cooldown, and I BKB blinked into the center of them and used it with the aid of PL.

5 wipe, three of them rage quit. So satisfying. 




 Pick Troll Warlord. Easy MMR. 




 EG.

They'd cut you and ppd would pour salt in your wounds. 




 At least you don't forget you have items.

Can't even begin to count how many times I've forgotten to activate my Satanic. 




  More money won.

Xboct has won 3 times the amount EE has won in Dota 2. 




 Played one against a PL and a Meepo the other day.

Some of the most satisfying echo slams I've ever landed. 




 The players. 




 Can you site your source please 




 From dota2.gamepedia: 

 Juggernaut can perform normal attacks during Blade Fury icon.png Blade Fury, but these attacks will deal no damage to enemies being affected by Blade Fury icon.png Blade Fury.

So if I'm 1v1'ing an enemy hero, my auto attacks will do no damage to them while under they are being affected by Blade Fury. Things like Basher, MKB, Diffusal will still proc though.

Is this correct?

edit: Cool so I got reported in my last game for being correct. I hate people. 




 Depends on your carry. I've been picking AM against jug recently, he omnis me and I just blink away. Spectre can Haunt out of it. Manta Style softens the blow of it on those carries as well as someone like Dusa. Hell you can even build a shadow blade if jug doesn't have a slot for detection.

On the topic of AM though, it really shows how overpowered jug is that he outcarries an AM at every stage of the game with only needing an abyssal. 




 I think you could turn it off, but yeah it was stupid. 

Doesn't change that Most Wanted was my favorite racing game of all time though. I honestly don't think I could find a flaw in that game. The gameplay was perfect, the soundtrack was perfect. I probably played through that like 4 times. 




 Yeah. The best time to gank is when their heroes are at half health due to lane harass, not when they've killed you 2 times and regenerated to full health and mana. 




 Draft nothing but high ground defense with one or two extremely good late game cores (Dusa and Spectre would work). Lose early game, lose all T2s, defend T3s, let comeback mechanics win the game for you. 




  I understand that this was what happened in the TI4 meta

It wasn't even that. Both teams picked early deathball lineups in the finals. Both knew that if they didn't get the extremely early lead, their lineup wasn't going to win. That's why we saw gg's at 20 minutes. 

A huge change in comeback mechanics for the entire game was absolutely not needed based on a pro strategy draft in a tournament finals.

 




 If one player is doing horribly, and are being toxic at the same time, I'll type a simple "wp" into chat every time they do something stupid. But that's all I'll do.

This pisses off the aforementioned player more than directly flaming them, and it does slightly heighten team morale because it's funny watching them get so pissed off.

Does it help you win the game? Not usually. But in what looks to be a sure loss, it helps lighten the blow. 




 God I fucking hate this. A game yesterday had a Troll mid on our team. Easy win right? No, he fucking sucked. As TROLL. Didn't go bottle, didn't go acquila, went directly into Phase/Shadow Blade. 25 minutes in all he had were Phase, SB and a morbid mask. I kept trying to tell him to go solo rosh after 15 minutes and his only response was "play your own hero."

We ended up winning, but definitely not because of him. 




 What I've noticed when people ask for ganks is that they don't ask when it's an opportune time for both parties. They ask when they're losing their lane. 

While you may think this would be the best time to gank, it's really not. If the enemy has an advantage over you, the last thing you should be doing is going to gank their lane and potentially dying because they are so much stronger at that point.

When a side lane feeds 2 kills and demands that I gank, I never do. a 3v2 does not automatically ensure a victory, especially when it's essentially a 2v2 because you got wrecked. 




 The problem is that many heroes in this game are MEANT to excel in the first 20-30 minutes. That's when they're the strongest. These heroes are now punished moreso than before for having their early lead because of an ingame mechanic.

These heroes generally fall off in the late game anyway (Viper, QoP are two examples I can think of immediately). There is no need to punish early game dominators harder simply for dominating, when that's the point of the fucking hero. 




 Some racing games had this same mechanic. If you had a significant lead, the cars behind you went faster to catch up to you. 

It was fucking retarded. 




 What I don't understand is if I queue, click Accept, and can't connect to the game, the home screen tells me the game is safe to leave. So I leave.

Then I'm prevented from matchmaking for 8 minutes for failing to ready up for my game. Okay valve. 




 Just won a 65 minute game because of comeback mechanics. The lineups were:

Drow, WR, Sniper, Timber, Techies on Dire (my team)

vs.

SF, LC, Necro, Invoker, Clock

WR fed SF 3 kills in the first 3 minutes. We lost the early game horrifically. SF bought a really quick BoTs and Shadow Blade, and him and Clock basically went around the map picking off the Drow and Sniper for the next 20 minutes. The only reason we won was because Techies just mined the shit out of the towers and lanes after we lost all T2s around 25 minutes and they couldn't push high ground.

Couple that with the comeback mechanics and synergy between Drow, WR and Sniper (massive damage boost from Drow aura) and we were able to win simply because one kill would give us something like 2k gold and we'd get an item.

We shouldn't have won that game. I'm not complaining necessarily because I got 25 MMR out of it, but without the current comeback mechanics that game would have been over in 35 minutes.

On the flip side, it does slightly prevent a complete mid domination (like this SF over our WR) from ending the game solo. In that case I like it because if 1 of your heroes feeds a ton but the other 4 are doing their job, you're not going to lose because 1 person fed a snow ball hero.

I don't exactly know where I stand with it. On one hand its stupid because if you're in a comfortable lead you should be allowed to win without an in-game mechanic punishing you harder for dying or losing a team fight, but it also slightly prevents snowball heroes from dominating and taking over a game and solo winning in 30 minutes due to a skill disparity, even though that's kind of the point of a snowball hero. 




 Then you run away and make him waste a BKB charge.  




 What? Bloodseeker is fine. Maybe I'm just really good at him, but he was the first hero I ever excelled at and I find him extremely fucking easy to pubstomp with. So easy that I don't even pick him.

Isn't he a Troll counter in a way? Build fast MKB and blade mail, Ult Troll, run at his face, pop blade mail. Troll can't do shit against you. He can TP away, but then I suppose that works too because now Trolls in base instead of raping your entire team. 




 Nobody can complain about the Weaver flair. I win! 




 That aghs ult is so fucking strong. Not overpowered necessarily, but god damn. 




 Eh. I love playing QoP, but I'd pick a Storm Spirit over her any day, and they accomplish pretty much the same goal. 




  They are really good cause no one knows what they do.

That made me chuckle.

But yeah, if you're sub 1k, learn Brood and just avoid fights and push towers. Remember that the point of this game isn't to get as many kills as possible, it's to take the enemies ancient. While the other 9 people are fighting mid at 15 minutes, rat away taking side lane racks and win the game because of it. I highly doubt anyone will buy dust to counter you, and if they do, it'll only be one person. And Brood is a pretty great 1v1'er, so you should be fine.

 100 cs by 15 minutes

That's actually pretty difficult in the trench considering after minute 8 heroes constantly just run at you. If you pick a hero that can rotate to the jungle early then yeah you're fine, but in that case your hero pool is limited. 




 I don't think invis heroes like Clinkz or Riki will ever be super prominent in the meta, simply because you counter invis heroes with a 180 or 200g purchase. 

He's really great pubstomper, but skilled players will rarely be caught out alone because they know to expect a Clinkz looking for them.  




 500 MMR detected 




 If throwing is losing one team fight when you're ahead, that's fucking retarded. 




 Damnit. My dreams are crushed. 




 2k you say?

Brb making my 11 year old half brother a dota account, battle point boosting him to 13 and queuing with him so I can roflstomp OP. 




 If you're radiant you can use the dire camp to pull your creep wave over, which messes with their equilibrium. If you're dire you're pretty SoL just try to not die and get levels and you've done your job. 




 75% win rate with him and I just realized today that the damage, hp and armor didn't scale with points into the ability.

He's too easy. 




 Because you steal stats at a faster rate, increasing your AS/damage at an even higher rate on a hero that has an invisibility ultimate that can't be countered by true sight and gives you faster health regeneration as well coupled with the lifesteal, and bonus movement speed if you don't kill the target during the duration of the Pounce leash.

 




 Play to win in Ranked, play for fun in Unranked is usually what I tell people. 




  Been playing Dota since the Warcraft 3 days

 370 hours racked up in Dota 2

He's not going to be sub 1k. 




 I think all he really needs is base movement speed reduced by 10 and his inherent bash removed, allowing him to build Skull Basher.

This hero does far too much work with just SnY and BKB, as well as being able to scale to the late game incredibly well. He has a built in 3k gold item on a hero whose ult allows him to reach max attack speed. That's kind of stupid. 




 I've wanted to try building MoM on Slark. I've seen people do it in trench tier incorrectly all the time, but if you combine it with orchid that's a fuckton of damage.

SB/Blink in, Orchid, Pounce/Dark Pact, wait for DP damage to stop ticking, activate MoM. 

Retards build MoM and use it before Dark Pact and end up killing themselves, but if you're not bad maybe it could work, especially in conjunction with Shadow Dance because nobody can physically attack you, you'd just need to avoid AoE or point target spells. 




 I don't sympathize with them at all. I'm all for region locking, but Valve won't do it. 




 Damnit I knew that. Must have had a brain fart. 




 Pick Troll Warlord, win game regardless of your team. 




 Because if they don't pick English their queue times are insanely massive most likely. 




 80% of reports I use give me notifications later that action was taken.  




 Pucks not that hard, you just need fast fingers and reflexes. 

If you were implying he's one of the most fun though I agree. 




 Every jug builds MoM this would never happen.

The Troll would dominate it. 




 If nobody picks within the last 3 seconds of the first few rounds I just random. 

We definitely don't need a reward for insta picking heroes. 




 If you start off with a lead, you must proceed to play a perfect game afterwards or else one mistake gives away the advantage you spent the last 10, 20, 30 minutes building. That's fucking retarded. It punishes lineups and heroes that excel early game, even though that's when a large number of heroes in this game are meant to excel.

 It severely punishes players for playing sloppy. and at the same time greatly benefits players for playing well.

While in a way this is true, it's also misleading. One team can play horribly for the first 20 minutes, group up as 5 and get a few pick offs and the game is back to even. 

If you have a lead, you shouldn't have to worry about a mechanic IN THE GAME that allows the losing team to come back easier. 

It's the same premise in some racing video games where the farther you were out in first place, the faster your opponents were able to go to catch up with you. In most of them there was an option to turn this off, but it was stupid as all hell. 




 It applies to all allies around you.

And just as an example, a level 3 Aghs Refresher Zeus ult does 1280 damage before all reductions. 1024 after basic 20% reduction, and 768 after basic reduction + Null Field.

1024-768=256. That's 256 damage you, and all allies around you, aren't taking because of 4 points in passive. 

If you put those points into stats instead, you'd gain 152 health points on just yourself.

If you'd take stats over Null Field, you're wrong.

 




 There's nothing you can do. Just play on and hope they're not in your next game. 




 I was just pointing out that that point doesn't really provide anything. His situation was that he missed the deward. Saying learn how to properly deward indicates you'll be able to properly deward 100% of the time, which is simply not true, and doesn't provide any help to his situation. 




  Laning: when you're playing carry with nukes or other spells that can help your supports get a kill - you should fight enemy offlane when supports initiate, that kill grants much more xp\gold teamwise then 2-5 lasthits you'll make meanwhile.

This is wrong. You should only participate if you're positive you will secure the kill and have communicated so beforehand. Just because a support throws out a stun doesn't mean you need to run away from the wave to follow up stun. 

 Counter-Stacking. If enemy team is making stacks, ask for help for push at your lane then contest those stacks with supports. There were so many games recently with 0-5 enemy offlane tide who gets ravage, participating in 2-2 exchange fight, getting stacks then owning rest of the game. Your supports can't really do much against that.

If you're safe lane and the enemy team is stacking the enemies jungle, there is absolutely no reason you should leave safe lane to help them contest stacks. That's the offlaners job. And if you're contesting ancient stacks with an enemy T1 or T2 still up, have fun getting destroyed when their heroes teleport in to kill you while you contest.
 




 Obviously someone can't read. I called the cops because of the boyfriend beating the mother you fucking twit. 




  learn how to properly deward

Even pros miss dewards.  









 A beginner Bane will constantly misuse Nightmare and Fiends Grip at inappropriate times and get cancelled immediately.

Bane is a hero that if you're picking him without ever seeing the hero played before, you're most likely going to do more harm than good. 




 How the list should be:

Sniper, Viper, Bloodseeker, Nightstalker, Bristleback.

None of these heroes require Blink Daggers, and the only one that requires positioning knowledge is Sniper. The other 4 you can essentially face rush the enemy team and right click to win.

 









  farm, buy items and right click.

Bane carry new meta? Okay. 




 Your responses are astronomically dumber than the question. Good job. 




 This is the only correct answer. 




 Null Field is actually pretty good. It's 20% at level 4 on top of the natural 20% every hero except Visage and Meepo have. 




 As opposed to her odds. 




 Wasn't Secret picking Zai offlane PL with some success? Can't remember specific games though 




  community it selfe gets better.

This will never happen. 




 I've started to drink a beer for every minute there is a pause.

I've also started to develop cirrhosis.  




 Depends on who you stack with. I've stacked with IRL friends that queue ranked and they go in to pick trolling combos or mess around instead of actually trying to win. That's fine if we're queuing unranked, but I don't stack with them any more because if I'm in ranked I'm trying to win, not mess around. 




 Maybe it's different in ranked than unranked. I only play ranked, and in the past month I've maybe been queued with a 3 stack once. Even 2 stacks at my MMR are fairly uncommon. 




 No it doesn't. It just makes it so you can't face rush two heroes and six creeps and spin to win an easy kill at level 2.  




 I used to be one of the early gg'ers if a particular player was doing horribly. I'd never give up, I'd keep trying though. I realized it creates a toxic environment and demoralizes the entire team however.

So now I don't say gg, because that brings down the entire team. I just type a simple "wp" every time that person does something stupid. It's actually been working because the rest of my team finds it kind of funny and lightens the mood in what could be a crushing loss. It also pisses off that particular player more than typing gg does, which is fine because I can then report him if he starts flaming.

Am I wrong to do this? Yeah probably. Oh well. 




 Look on the right side of the screen. 

 New to Dota 2? Start here. 




 I very rarely get matched with people in more than a 2 stack. Guess I'm lucky. 




 I randomed him in a game earlier. Dual safe with a PA against Troll and Omniknight. Had a Nature's Prophet on our team that ported in every time Omni left to check rune. We killed Troll 3 times before 10 minutes.

Then lost the game in 24 minutes because our mid Storm fed their SF 4 kills and they had a Pugna to just mow down our towers.

That's dota for you.

I rarely play Oracle, but it looks like it's a solid pick along side a heavy physical dps carry. 




  go around saving enemies when they are trying to help

 builds an aghs when we have an ns already

Those are individual skill problems. They don't have the skill and knowledge to realize what they're doing on that hero isn't appropriate for their current game.   




 Counter Helix rescale from 100/135/170/205 to 50/115/170/205.

No hero should be able to cut a creep wave at level 2 with two heroes harassing him and walk away having done more damage to the heroes than what he took.  




 The base MS and the bash removal are the only changes out of these he actually needs. All of these will completely destroy the hero. While I wouldn't mind that happening necessarily, it's not an approach you should take. 




 I was thinking that it was because you can't lifesteal from illusions, and while people are saying that, I looked on two different dota 2 wiki's and neither mention that this is true.

It only mentions that illusions don't benefit from lifesteal. Maybe someone has some editing to do. 




 Are you playing in ranked? Because if so, and if you're getting Deso over Euls/Aghs you have every right to be called a noob.

If you're playing in unranked then it doesn't matter. 




 So it does the exact same thing, but as Unit Target instead of Point Target? I don't think that's necessary. 
























 Don't have a twitch account, but you should do [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/319dcr/spooky_lifestealer_build/) and let us know how it goes. 




 Currently he's really weak. He's traditionally run as a mid laner that gets a level advantage and forces down towers early on in the game. However, he's an extremely weak mid laner compared to the heroes being run in mid in the current meta. I can't think off the top of my head any hero you would pick Dragon Knight specifically against. He mainly farms with his Q, however he suffers hard from lack of mana. If you run a Bottle, you need to crow it constantly or make absolutely sure that you secure every rune, else you'll get dominated. Generally you max your Q, followed by passive, taking 1 point in your stun in between, and ult at 6/11/16. 

As far as items go, Treads are core. You'll need either Bottle or Soul Ring for a long time because shit mana pool. Drums used to be great on him but I'm not sure if they're still core. BKB is essential. AC is essential. He falls off really hard after that unless you somehow manage to snowball with a bunch of kills though, because he doesn't flash farm particularly well. If you have to go late game, I'd recommend building Mjollnir and Shivas and just being a fucking massive tank in the front lines. You're not really expected to put out a ton of damage because you're not a "hard carry", but you sure as hell can take some. His passive+Shivas+AC is +42 armor. I'm actually not positive if there's some kind of armor cap on a hero, because +42 sounds a bit extreme. Even if there is, the Active is still great for your team if you don't have anyone else to build it, considering you have a built in Skadi slow at level 3 Dragon Form and I do believe they stack. Daedalus is another option so that could potentially put some damage out as well.

His niche is built around being a complete siege tank in the early game. However, after TI4 early push/deathball strats were nerfed pretty heavily so he's not really useful for anything at the moment. 




 Kind of. Oracle fits a certain lineup. She's both super aggressive and super defensive at the same time. If you have a heavy physical damage team, her W is amazing. If you're against a magic heavy lineup, it can also be super useful on an ally, keeping in mind however that it does disarm them. Her Q is insanely good too.

I've yet to really understand the mechanics of E and R though. All I do know is that I can play her, but not well enough to pick in Ranked. And that she can either be monstrously overpowered, or fuck up your entire teamfight depending on how she's handled.

edit: So after reading it, I'm assuming her E works two ways. Either as a finishing nuke for an enemy hero (great in the laning stage as it does 270 damage at level 3 with a 750 cast range) or you cast it on an ally immediately before False Promise. It's non-lethal to allies, but that's a really risky move if they're anywhere close to 360 health (level 4).

Oracle + Necro would be so fucking strong. E+R+NecroQ+Mek onto something like a Bristleback. Jesus. That combo alone is around a 1200 heal when False Promise ends if the target doesn't take any damage during it. And offensively, she has 660 magical damage from both of her nukes before resistance. Great setup for an easy Reaper's Scythe.

Also I just remembered she is a he, but I'm not fixing the typos. 




 Puck. Unfortunately not picked as often as I'd like to see, but Puck is probably my favorite hero to watch.

As for current meta heroes, probably QoP. I like watching evasive heroes that can make huge plays with spells. 




 Kappa 




  high school

Found your problem. 




 Dotabuff?

 




 It satisfies my need for competition.  




  I'm wondering what pros are using in Ghosts.

Okay.

I don't know if you were paying attention to the video, but he was spectating all 4 different players on the team throughout the match. All 4 were on at least a 7. And Fear was one of the top teams in MW2, as were Optic and nV, all who all definitely played on at least a 7. 

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDIbiygD7lo) is a gameplay from Optic Nadeshot's perspective in BO2. at 1:16 look at how fast he does a 180. There is no way that is 3 sensitivity. Once again, it's at least a 7. 

I'm also done caring about this. 




 [Optic vs Fear in MW2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EliLUG4OYu4)

This is easily 7 sensitivity, if not higher. I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

Now if you're talking about any game newer than Black Ops 2, I wouldn't know because after BO2 I stopped buying Call of Duty games. But before that, they were on 7 or higher. 




 Dazzle is actually more of a counter to Axe than Axe to Dazzle.

Poison Touch and Shadow Wave shit on him in lane if he tries to creep skip. If he calls 3 heroes in a team fight + creeps, Shadow Wave shits on him again. Medallion of Courage is basically core on Dazzle, which is great against him. Weave buffs up the armor of your entire team, which makes his spins so much less fearsome. Force Staff is pretty core on Dazzle too, which can potentially reposition an ally away from Axe before he gets culled, allowing you to Grave and maybe get a quick heal so they'll survive, or at least longer.

The only downside is he can Ult through your Grave. Otherwise Dazzle has the upper hand by far. 




 I'm completely doing this next time I play drunk unranked. 




  in fact most good players played on less than 5 on CoD 

This is so completely wrong. I actually watched plenty of competitive Call of Duty matches, mostly nV and Team Fear, and they were all on 9-10.  

Yeah it might not translate exactly between games, but I like all of my games on high camera speed/sensitivity because it's what I've gotten used to. 




 3.5k? He sounds like a troll, which are prevalent in every bracket though. 




 Could literally be any bracket, but seeing the bristle safe lane makes me think probably 2k. 




 Agreed. Used to play Call of Duty on 9-10 sensitivity on Xbox. Use 53 on Dota2. 




 3.9k 




 A dream? 




 3k 




 This could either be really low, or really high.

My first instinct was 2.8k. 




 Your team can feed away all they want, all that means currently is you get more comeback gold when you take smart engagements after you get a couple crucial items and become unstoppable.

Even if the score is 30-5 at 30 minutes, if you show up to a team fight with a Battlefury/Manta/BKB on an Anti-Mage you're going to shit stomp them. Wait until the team fight is almost over and the enemy is chasing the last remaining player on your team, go in, burst down whoever has the biggest mana pool with your BKB active so they can't stop you, Mana Void, get Rampage. Proceed to get Butterfly and Abyssal in the next 5 minutes because you just stopped 3 Godlike streaks and go end the game essentially by yourself.

Just an example, but it's kind of what you need to do. Another tip is to always carry a TP scroll. Inevitably, at that MMR, players do not know when to back off of a team fight. You'll see them dive T2s at 15 minutes and half health to try and get that one last kill. If you TP in, that's potentially an easy triple kill and a lot of gold in your pocket. Outfarming them, smart engagements, knowing when to back off of or not enter a fight, and capitalizing on your enemies' mistakes are the key to winning in your bracket, and really every bracket as a carry. 




 Sounds like a typical 3k game to me. 




 I'm assuming you forgot to include the dotabuff link. 




 Incoming thread by said player: "Why is TA so underpowered, Valve please buff." 




 I safe carry spammed PA a few days ago and got a 10 winstreak. Went from 2.9k to 3.2k with a couple wins on different heroes in between. 




 I played mid to rise from 2.6k to 3k in essentially a weeks time (though it was largely in part to spamming Troll Warlord).

Now though, I don't consider my mid skills aren't exactly up to par with my opponents most of the time. I usually end up playing TOO safe and don't secure enough cs or don't harass their mid laner enough and lose out on the farm battle. The pressure is a bit much, and if I do die I tilt hard. So I try to avoid midding and either safe lane carry or safe lane support, roles I consider myself better at anyway. If I do have to mid, I'll pick something like QoP. Easy to cs with QoP, solo kill potential at 6 even without a rune, built in escape mechanism, and if you get a good rune you can double kill their side lanes at any level. 




 There's your problem. At that MMR, you are far better off learning a snowball hero and learning how to farm than supporting someone who can't break 20cs by 10 minutes. 




 I'm 3.2k. Give me Troll in a 1.4k game and it'll be over in 20 minutes.

As a piece of advice, learn snowball heroes and spend the first 15-20 minutes purely farming or only participating in team fights or ganks that you are positive you can get kills in without dying. Ignore your team flaming you for not helping their T2 tower dives at minute 10, they're at 1.4k for a reason. 




 I'd prefer to play with a stack over solo. Unfortunately, the only people I can stack with are real life friends who would rather use that time to practice trolling heroes/builds rather than tryhard to win. 




 You're 5k and your TA maxed Meld? How is that possible?

edit: I didn't read your second line. Maybe they were drunk.  




 Well, try and save your mid pick for 4th or 5th if possible to avoid getting hard countered, or if you do maybe their hard counter doesn't fit their lineup in which case now they're at a disadvantage after the laning stage. For example, first picking TA is essentially begging them to insta pick Viper. Or pick mid heroes that are harder to counter/natural lane dominators (Viper, Troll, Sniper are great mid laners but with the exception of Troll do have their drawbacks later in the game).

If you're ganked, you need to pay better attention to the minimap and watch what your opponent is doing. If one or two heroes are missing and he's aggressively farming/pushing out the lane, that's a good indication that he has backup near him waiting for you to get out of position. 

I'm not sure what your MMR is but I'm at 3.2k, started at 1.8k. I've yet to see the mindset change from "mid needs to gank side lanes all the time" to "I'm a support and my carry is okay, I'm going to smoke rotate mid". 

If you are ganked, don't let it phase you. You have two options, either go back to mid and secure some more cs or tp to a side lane to go for a kill. Most people expect you to do the former, so the latter could catch them off guard and net you a couple kills.  




 I'd guess 2.5k  




 We have a close enough winner, 3150 MMR. Looked at the Sniper's dotabuff, 47% winrate out of 1,000 games with over 150 abandons. Also didn't build BKB and ran MoM against 5 carries. I hate people.

Gonna have to go with 3.5k for yours.  




 This post should have been made yesterday. 




 Don't make misplays. Assume your opponent is better than you and play a bit safer, secure your cs, and only go for a kill if you secure a rune. Haste runes are almost a guaranteed kill depending on the matchup. 

If you're constantly losing mid, then you need to play a different role. 




 2k 




 After 20 minutes, QoP is pretty much all about landing her Pure Damage ult onto the carry and ideally as many other targets as possible in team fights. Aghs is core. If you can convince someone on your team to run Lina and build Aghs, that's almost 1500 damage unmitigated, going through BKB onto a single target (goodbye Troll Warlord and Sniper).

She's one of my favorite heroes to play, but I find it hard to solo win games with her as well.



 




 If the abandon was because of the ES pick, I'm assuming over 4k considering nobody is scared of an ES sub that.

Wild guess, 4.5k. 




 Just thought of a fun little idea. Obviously there are times where things are said in game, or actions performed, that either make you completely facepalm and want to euthanize the player, or shock you that they actually were able to pull off an amazing combo/feat/juke or had insight that maybe your own 9k MMR self hadn't realized before.

What about a thread where we share these snippets of conversation, gifs or scenarios and try to guess the MMR of the mentioned player(s).

I'll start. Game I just finished. Sniper mid against Death Prophet. Sniper didn't level Shrapnel until level 10. His reasoning? "Shrapnel costs too much mana, I'd rather not skill it until later." Okay. I can understand his reasoning for that at least, ignoring the fact that Shrapnel is Sniper's best skill and aside from his ultimate is the only thing you even need mana for, and that the extra points into Take Aim are useless against a DP that can farm with Q if taking too much harass, while owning a Bottle on herself to regen through it. But I gave him the benefit of the doubt even though I, and I imagine everyone with half a brain, would disagree with his choice.

Then I checked his inventory. He had a Bottle.

 "Shrapnel costs too much mana, I'd rather not skill it until later."

 Buys Bottle

Palm, meet face.

Go.
 




 Troll Warlord movespeed reduced by 10.

Eul's movespeed either reduced or removed.

Pure Damage is going to be huge in TI5, making Lina/QoP/Spectre first pick/ban every game.

 




 Because people think they're the best player on the server and carries get to be "in charge" and get the "glory" per se. 




 600 MMR more and I could potentially play with s4 smurf :o

edit: Immediately tune in and see him completely turn around a FB attempt by their mid and get it himself, followed by a Haste rune and another kill on mid within a minute. Okay s4. 




 Ah fair enough 




  Because Dota 2 is a game I would never, ever, recommend to any children younger than 15 years old.

This is why on video games with online capabilities there is a disclaimer that online play cannot be rated for any particular age group. Once somebody, in USA at least, hits age 14, they're fine to play online games in my opinion. There's nothing you'll hear in Dota, Call of Duty, Halo, WoW, etc. that you won't hear from the 18 year olds in the hallways of your high school.

 I have heard of some Hidden pool that regroups people with bad manners

There is speculation that the "Would you enjoy playing with this player again?" or whatever it is after games where you can rate them is a hidden contributor to matchmaking, but this is kind of flawed. I could be playing with the nicest guy in the world, but if he's absolute trash in the game, I don't want to play with him on my team again. So I give him 1 star. Well, that's unfortunate for the nice but trash player, because if the hidden pool affects matchmaking, and if he gets 1 star ratings often, now he's potentially going to be placed in a pool of toxic players. On the flip side, I could have an absolute asshole on my team, but if he went 25-0 and easily carried the game for us, I'd be fine with having him on my team again. 5 stars. I can mute him if I don't want to listen to his toxicity. I care more about winning.

 TL;DR: During matchmaking, instead of regrouping players with bad manners, separate them and put them in stacks of well mannered players.

There are a large number of players who never get low priority, or if they do it's because of abandons due to Internet issues or real life emergencies, not reports. Why would you want to punish players who have good manners by putting a toxic rager on their team? 




 Pings are very important in game. I'm really curious of your MMR if you have pings disabled. 




 Played against one 3.2k MMR yesterday that actually did a hell of a lot of work. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1367360913

He fed off of my team a bit, snowballed to 13-2 and was able to get some key items while I was still farming. He picked up MKB around the same time I got my Bfly on Dusa and stuck on me the entire time in fights. The fight was basically decided by who died first, me or DK. We still ended up winning, mostly because their Troll was garbage and we outplayed them in a couple crucial fights at the end. 




 Good thing nobody balances based around ability draft. 




 I think Ursa is fine really. A buff would mean I see more Ursa junglers in my pubs.

I'm sick of Ursa junglers. 




 It's a great item for a carry if you're forced to fight before you really want to, but it's not exactly what you want to go for on most safe lane farmers.

It used to be a good utility item for offlaners and aura builders, but now for just a couple hundred gold more you can pick up a Euls and be immensely more effective. 




 My prediction is he will get some adjustments in 6.84 and be added to CM before TI5.  




 I'm sure every pro player, definitely supports, knows his mechanics and how to play him. However I can't think of anyone that is known per se for Oracle play. 




 Troll Warlord.

If you don't end the game at or before 35 minutes you're doing it wrong.

As for any earlier, you need more than one good pushing hero and good coordination on your team. But the quickest games I've won by myself have been when I snowballed Troll, took Aegis at around 14 minutes, took all of the outer towers that were still standing, waited for next Aegis around 25 minutes and then ended the game. 




 Yeah but wouldn't everyone? 




 I add the seasoning and Sriracha.  




  Who lanes ck and centaur together? 

3k Peruvians. 




  centaur + abaddon offlane

I had a fucking centaur + ck lane against me today. Jesus christ that was fucking annoying. Neither farmed well so that's a plus, and I was playing Troll so I could just cs with ranged form, but if I or my support ventured just a tiny bit too close it was nearly instant death. Reality Rift, CK stun, Centaur Stun, Double Edge. If VS wasn't close enough to stun the Centaur I was dead. If VS got caught there was nothing I could do.

Fucking brutal. 




 Using Swap to initiate is just asking for trouble in that match. Your initiation should have consisted of Moonlight Shadow with Troll and Bloodseeker going in first, and VS saving Swap to bail one of them out from a Shackleshot, Call, Eclipse or Death Ward. 

If you were being initiated upon, it could have just been good skill from the Axe to get the VS each time, but with a Blink and Force there's really no excuse for that except poor positioning. 




  Help your team out, it'd probably win you more games if you lead in game and tell your team what they should try to do.

I'm only 3k, but if there was a 4k on my team I'd probably follow his orders like a sheep to a herder. Unless he was a dick.  




 According to dota2.gamepedia: 

 Deals damage in 1 second intervals, starting immediatly upon toggling the spell on.

So does this mean you can spam your R in a faster interval than 1 second to dish out 2-4 times the damage? I can press it 6-8 times in the span of a second, that would be toggling it on, off, and on again 3-4 times. I remember people complaining about scripts being used for Pudge to toggle Rot extremely quickly and it boosted the damage of it immensely, or something of the sort. Does the same concept apply to Lesh?

Obviously that would decimate your mana pool, but a level 3 ult doing 480 damage in 1 second for 510 mana if you're able to toggle it 3 times per second? You could sustain that for 4 seconds with a 2k mana pool. That's almost 2k damage before resistance and assuming there's no BKB's in a 450 radius.

I'm assuming there's some internal cooldown or something, but I've never tested it. 




 I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I kind of miss the Russians on US E. The Peruvians are so much fucking worse.  




 If your VS is getting caught by the Axe then they are not positioning themselves correctly.

While swap is good for initiation, it's better saved for saving your carry or important core that may have been initiated on. 

Dotabuff link? It would be easier to determine which would be better if we could see both teams. 




 1.5k MMR detected. 




 Yes, it's happened to me twice this week. A simple reconnection is all you need to fix it. 




  'we needed a female strength hero' 

muh SJW's 




 Am I the only person that didn't know up until about a month ago that you weren't supposed to drain the water out of the Ramen after you boil it? That it was actually supposed to be a soup? I mean yeah it says soup on the bag but I never left the water in there. 




 Peruvians are the worst thing about Dota 2. Russians are nothing compared to Peruvians. 




 The problem with Alchemist specifically is he gets a huge amount of net worth very quickly, that you hand right over to the enemy team due to the current comeback mechanics if you die. 

Something to keep in mind. 




 You're losing with Troll at 1.4k? Is that even possible? 




 It would be core on every hero except QoP and AM. And maybe PA. 




 I'd rather be first hit slowed than first hit bash locked. 




 Someone posted a comment a few days ago suggesting scaling the attack damage, health and armor from his Q instead of static at all levels, in addition to the -10 movespeed.

That would be enough for me. Either that or remove his bash and allow him to build Basher. Either one of those are fine by me.  




 It's happened to me twice, and I think there was a thread or two about it.  




 Ranked should be for tryharding to win the game, Unranked should be for casual/fun/practicing. That's why there is a separation. 




 http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel#List_of_abilities_that_cannot_be_dispelled_by_strong_dispels 




 Troll is going to be hit with the nerf hammer. Probably in the form of his Q and I'm hoping a base movement speed reduction. Juggernaut will probably get some kind of nerf, but I'm not sure what it will entail. Axe and Sniper won't be touched. Taking a shot in the dark to say the movement speed increase from Eul's is going to be removed. Oracle will be added to CM with some slight adjustments.

Probably some more adjustments to the comeback gold mechanic. Just as nobody really liked the deathball finals, I don't think anyone is going to like the potential super turtle, lose early game but hold out for late game with 5 buybacks and rely on comeback gold because we're playing for millions of dollars, finals that this current patch has the capability of producing. 

Pure damage is going to be huge in the upcoming patch and TI5. Lina and QoP will be first pick/ban 100% of the time.  Shadow Demon is going to be top tier. Puppey Enigma is going to wreck face. I see Spectre being picked up a lot more than she is now. Even Timbersaw could see some action. 

Patch will come in the first couple weeks of May, I propose. 




 "fuk u im 500 frm blink noob no wards" 




  what you will be learning is not how to play dota, but how to play dota with severely mentally handicapped teammates.

This is so true. When I was at 2.6k, and even sometimes still at 3.2k, I'll be in a game where it's something like 30-25 at the 25 minute mark because each team is just face rushing the other and going for as many kills as possible and I'm sitting there facepalming because it's fucking retarded. 




 I've risen from [2656](http://i.imgur.com/eC5AbH0.jpg) to [3255](http://i.imgur.com/3xMsS2k.jpg) in the past week. 

The best advice I can give is to play what you're best at. For me, that seems to be carries that can go balls deep and snowball. I went 15-7 with Troll Warlord this past week, so there's +200 MMR. I'm 11-1 with PA in the past two days, so there's another +275 right there. My TW and PA win rates on this account are 68% and 71% respectively, so those are heroes that I'm good at (and Troll is OP). Compare that to Sniper, who may also be very strong right now, but only holds a 36% for me on this account. I'm not going to pick him, because I can't win games with him. 

Don't necessarily try to fill the role your team might need every game if you aren't comfortable with it. It's better to pick one hero/role and be extremely comfortable playing it than bounce around between different styles of heroes every game (until you're skilled enough to do so, but even pros stick to their designated and most comfortable role). That said however, you should learn and practice 2-4 heroes for every role in time, so that if you do need to fill the shoes of a hard support in a game because your Peruvian teammates insta picked 3 cores and a jungler, you've practiced a hero that performs this role and can play it rather than picking a 5th core and screwing over your team moreso. 

When I was at 2.6k, I would usually mid. I would also usually win mid (with Troll kappa) and my team and I would snowball from there. Now, at 3.2k, I've realized that my mid skills probably aren't up to par with some of the people I'll be facing. So instead, I play a safe carry that I know like the back of my hand (PA) and perform well in a role I'm comfortable with, or play a safe lane support that I'm comfortable with (Lion usually) since I also know how to properly pull creep waves (something that I've yet to find people knowing on a consistent basis at my current MMR, seriously if you're going to support you need to know how to properly pull or you're just going to screw over your carry) and allow our safe lane to completely deny their offlane. 

Another tip: take smart engagements. If you aren't ready to fight, don't let your team bait you into taking a stupid fight. If you're 200g off of your BKB, don't take a fight. If your Chronosphere is on cooldown for another 60 seconds, don't take a fight. And if you're playing carry, farming for your first big items is more important than assisting your team that will inevitably start running at the enemy team after the laning stage because they don't actually know how to play and think because the first tower fell it's time to stop farming and start fighting. The biggest thing I'm noticing as I rise in MMR is that there are less and less people that fight before they're ready. This is why you learn 10 or so specific heroes. You'll know when you're ready to take a fight because you've played that hero 20 times and it's essentially instinct. 

Also, it's generally easier to win the game as a snowballing carry if you truly do outskill the rest of your server. But I've won games where my support play was essentially the only thing keeping us in it until our mediocre carry finally got the farm to come online. I'd practice carries and focus on practicing last hits and learning farming mechanics first. That's something you need to know regardless of what hero you play. Every hero needs gold.

Hope this helps. 




 I wouldn't know. I insta lock NP, afk cliff jungle, alt tab and watch a tournament vod until the games over. 




 Absolutely. Are you 1k MMR or something? 




 Yeah I know to max Dagger, that's a given. I've been laning against some stupid combos in my recent games so I occasionally need the reduced cooldown on Blink Strike to be able to escape.  




 Maxing Blur is better than Blink Strike? I always put a value point in, but usually at that stage it's magic burst that takes me down, not right clicks. And by that point I have enough mana sustain to be able to Blink Strike creeps in the jungle to burst them down faster, and I can blink around in a team fight for more damage. 




  The pms aquila drums treads and helm

I skipped over RoA and Drums because I definitely don't cs as well as him in lane and getting both of those would delay me too much, but yeah essentially. edit: Hm. Actually just looked it up and I thought 70 cs at 10 was the benchmark, I usually get 50-55 as PA, but apparently 70 is like god tier or something, so maybe I'll try grabbing these and see what happens.

 taking active fights constantly whenever you see the chance,

What's cool about low 3k is that pretty much during minutes 10-15 the rest of the server is off fighting somewhere else on the map, allowing me to essentially free farm the safe lane and jungle for the next 10 minutes. I always keep a TP scroll so if a fights going down near a tower I can rotate in and assist (generally at the end to get a couple clean up kills) but if they're at an enemy T2 or in their jungle or something they're on their own until I get my items. 




 I still think Axe is too strong. I hope he gets any kind of nerf in 6.84, I don't really care what it is but no hero should be able to creep cut your safe lane at level 2 and walk away potentially doing more damage to you than what he took. If he's solo. If you have an Axe +1 offlane you're just fucked. 




 Surprised you didn't get shrekd by a Lina ult every time you jumped in. 

Very High Skill but their Huskar only has a Blink Dagger what 




 The theory goes that if you're a 5-6k player you will get there regardless of what role you play. Your average player isn't going to magically jump to 6k by picking solo offlane.

That said, there are definitely heroes you can pick to control the tempo of the game/turn the *tide* of a team fight.^^huehue

Clockwerk is one that comes to mind. Tidehunter. Axe can definitely take over a game. Batrider. Even something like a Nyx, currently completely out of the meta though, can be a huge factor in winning the early game with successful rotations once you get Vendetta up. Brood is another hero, provided you don't get hard countered, that can easily win a game by herself if left to her own devices. 




  ~~HoD~~ HotD 




 So I've been spam picking PA over the past few days. Was 1-4 on this account prior to a couple days ago. I've won 10 straight, am 11-4 now. Currently sitting at 3229 MMR. 

Curious to see some of your thoughts and builds on this hero in the current meta. What I've been doing is going PMS  Treads  HotD  Basher  BKB/Abyssal depending on which I need first, and then I'm pretty much snowballing with an Aegis and the games over. If not, I either finish Satanic if I'm not surviving or grab an MKB to essentially one shot them upon blinking in. It seems like the Battlefury PA is a thing of the past or highly situational. If I get to the point where I need to be fully slotted, I expect I'd go BoTs, Abyssal, Satanic, BKB, Skadi, MKB. Is this correct? 

Surprised to see she's not picked more often in competitive by a team other than Secret rarely for Arteezy. She's a hard counter to Sniper, she has the capabilities to man fight a Troll Warlord because he doesn't really want to build a MKB before SnY/BKB/Skadi and you can Abyssal him during his ult. I believe you can blink out of Juggernaut ult provided you have a target. Basically shits on every support. And you don't even need a ton of farm to come online. You can get easy kills at 6 with a support and a crit, even moreso at 11 with your Basher. 

dotabuff if anyone cares: http://www.dotabuff.com/players/206703220

The 9 I played in the last two days are in latest matches. The two outliers involved needing to buyback 3 times to save our base from being taken by Troll and PL in the 7/9/27 so my farm was atrocious, and in the 1/12/10 I was drunker than shit. Space created.

Also relevant flair.

edit: Well the streak had to end some time. I swear to god if I see one more fucking jungle juggernaut losing me a game I'm going to stab someone. I don't know whose idea that was, but it's fucking retarded. 




 Never played LoL but I looked up the skills of the hero. Your 3 typical full time jungle supports in Dota are Enchantress, Chen and Enigma. All 3 require heavy use of micro'ing to be played properly (if I see another Midas rush Enchantress in my jungle I'm going to cry). If that's not your style, avoid them.

Alternatively, Sand King is a strong jungler after a few levels in the lane that could appeal to you. 




 Why would you max Battle Hunger before Counter Helix? It's easily his least useful skill. 




  It is an untapped resource in most pub matches sadly.

Not sure what MMR bracket you're in, but there are constantly LCs, Ursas and Axes jungling in my 3k games. Throw the occasional Bloodseeker and Juggernaut in there too. 




 If you don't micro your eidolons properly they'll all die before any of them replicate, making it essentially worthless. It takes a level of skill that I doubt a beginning jungler would have. 




 You're wrong. 




 They were building into a Basher too. Theorycrafting that the ghosts from her ultimate, being a physical damage source, could proc bashes perhaps? 

...oh my god that would be overpowered.  




  Has anyone bought a TP at all this game?

 -I have once

My sides. 




 Force Staff is stupid, Mjollnir...eh it's not stupid but also not really the best.

The key component you're missing is Abyssal Blade. I don't think Vlads and Heart are necessary, in my opinion you should replace Vlads with the Heart.

6 slotted Ursa in my opinion should be BoTs, Abyssal, BKB, Blink, Skadi, Butterfly/Heart/MKB.

Butterfly if you're going against physical damage dealers that don't want to build MKB, Heart if you're going against a lot of magic or physical damage dealers that tend to build MKB, or if there's already evasion on your team that they need MKB for. If you need MKB yourself, I'd replace the Butterfly with it.

The general consensus is that Skadi is superior to Heart at the moment, however Heart has good synergy with your ultimate. It's kind of up to you at that point.
 




 Number 1 thing at 1k MMR: Do not listen to your teammates. Do not rely on your teammates.

I don't want this to sound too mean, but you, and everyone on your teams, are probably worse than the average player. If you are playing Spectre and it's 15 minutes in, you don't have your Radiance (old build, just using an example) and you're being flamed for farming instead of fighting, mute him and continue farming. If you're playing a farming carry your number one priority is to get your items. That doesn't mean fully 6 slotted, but items that allow you to fight with an advantage over the other team. This means you need to practice last hitting in bot matches. In 1k I doubt most people even get 25 cs by 10 minutes. If you can hit 55, you're already at something like a 1500 gold lead over your counterpart (rough guesstimate). That's almost a full item. 

What I would recommend is picking one carry that you're best with. I wouldn't necessarily recommend Spectre because he's not that strong right now and a little too heavy late game for what you should be looking for. Troll Warlord, Juggernaut, Slark, Bloodseeker, Phantom Assassin are all heroes that require a bit less farm, can be useful in smart engagements earlier on, and can take over a game if allowed to snowball. They also can move into the jungle to farm, providing you safety from being seen on the mini map assuming the opposing team doesn't have wards and probably won't come looking for you too often. Pick one, and pick it every game. Learn the mechanics of the hero, and learn the mechanics of farming. That will give you a huge edge over your opponent, who will probably just try to run at you after the 10 minute mark. Farm up a couple crucial items, then go find pick offs on heroes that are farming too aggressively.

Supporting most likely isn't going to get you out of 1k. Learn a carry, learn what every item does and its interactions with your carry and *why* it's a good item for your carry, learn to farm and outfarm the enemy team. Generally in your bracket, it won't matter which player may be a bit more skilled, if you have Phase/BKB/Basher while they're sitting on brown boots and a mask of madness, you're going to crush them. And generally in your bracket, the rest of your team will follow the strongest hero. If that's you, then lead them to victory.

 




 Troll Warlord is easy win unless you're mentally handicapped or get heavily dominated early. People keep saying Sniper is OP but I really disagree. He's just annoying. If you see a Sniper pick just pick PA for yourself and crit him for 2k when he builds MoM. It's not hard. 




 I play Dota because I have an inner need for competition. I've always loved playing sports and pitting my skills against another to see who is better, and Dota is no different. It seems weird to say, but I don't play Dota for fun necessarily. I play it to win. So yeah I take the game seriously. If I want to play a game for fun I play something single player that doesn't involve other people. Does that mean I'm a tryhard, micromanager and flamer some of the time? Yeah it happens. If you're playing like a noob I'm going to tell you you're playing like a noob. If you're fucking up I'm gonna tell you that you're fucking up. I could work on being nicer about it I suppose, but I digress.

The toxicity will never end. It's been in online games long before Dota and will continue long past it. The only thing you can do is play your best, and if you lose because of an intentional feeder, just brush it off and play your next game like it didn't happen. 




 Phase  MoM  Mjollnir  Abyssal  Skadi would be how I assume this would work. 




  since the /r/Dota2 subscribers are notorious for being reasonable and level-headed people.

All of my lols. 

This was good. 




 Tinker has Rearm though. A 5 sec BKB only gets you out of 1 Laser.

It's 1.5k MMR so I doubt it, but you never know. 




  Support counter-picks don't matter.

Kappa.

 




 This is probably a joke.

If it's not, that guy's a fucking idiot. 




 Watch your replays. Find your mistakes and analyze them. Figure out what you did wrong in that situation and remember it, so when that situation inevitably arises again, you know what NOT to do. 

Were you solo attacking an enemy T2 with 4 heroes missing, and got ganked and died? Yeah don't do that. Did you continue trying to take T3's after 2 of the enemies bought back, and you died? Probably not the best idea. Did you kill steal with Lion ult on a Crystal Maiden that was at 100 health instead of saving it for the full health Phantom Assassin that was on his way in? Pretty noob move right there.

A huge thing is knowing when to be aggressive, and when to back off. When to farm, and when to fight. A part of this is also the "save your friend syndrome". If your teammate got himself into a stupid situation and is about to die, unless you're completely positive that your contribution will either save his life, or get return kills while not sacrificing your own life, then go for it. If you're not completely positive, it's best to run away and lose one hero instead of losing two. On the flip side of that, if you see 3 heroes clumped together and you're playing Axe with your team beside you, Blink right on them and be the initiator you're supposed to be. 

TL;DR: Watch your replays, figure out what you do correctly and incorrectly and adjust your playing habits accordingly.
 




 Those are great ideas, but achievements would ruin the game. 

Right now, the objective is to win. And that's how it should be. There is no way in hell I'm supporting something where a teammate denies my Aegis because "I'm only 1 away from the Achievement." or something similar.

It's bad enough I get stuck with people playing Shadow Demon or Kunkka for the first time because it's their turn in the All Hero Challenge and proceed to fuck up every team fight.

If they were to implement it, my only request would be that Ranked Matches do not count towards Achievements. That way you could use Unranked to farm achievements if you were so inclined. 




 http://www.dotabuff.com/personality/eyJwbGF5ZXJfaWQiOjIwNjcwMzIyMCwiYSI6NCwidCI6NCwiYyI6MywiaSI6MiwiZCI6MSwiaCI6Mn0=

This is accurate. 




 I don't know, I've risen from 2.6-3.2k this past week and haven't been flamed for farming when I "should" be fighting. It's better for you that they're fighting across the map instead of repeatedly trying to gank you. Even if your team is losing, if you get some key items and take smart engagements with your team later, the comeback gold you can get skyrockets you basically back to even.

If you come out of nowhere with a Basher/BKB when they thought you had as shit farm as the rest of your team, you're going to do some heavy damage. The surprise factor and a couple seconds of hesitation from the enemy is sometimes all you need to quickly win a fight. 

That being said, if you're not farming quickly, then you're useless. What I've noticed in 2k is that the majority of players stop farming around 12 minutes and start running at you whenever they see you. At that point, whoever had more cs or kills in the laning stage is usually going to come out on top in fights. A lot of people in this bracket don't realize that certain heroes need more farm to be more effective than others. A level 6 Anti Mage does not have the same impact as a level 6 Bloodseeker, for example. 

It does take some experience to know when the proper time to enter a fight is. Usually, it isn't when the Peruvian is spam pinging you because he ran head first into 3 heroes and died.

edit: Generally a good time to take a fight is right after a big item pick up. Just bought a fresh BKB? Take a fight. Just finished Abyssal? Take a fight. It's hard to coordinate smoke ganks in 2k because most of the players don't even know Smoke exists, but that's what you need to do. Also, taking Roshan. There are many heroes that with certain items can solo Roshan (Troll with HoD, level 11 and an Alpha Wolf / PA with level 11 HoD and Basher / AM with...I don't remember but you get the point). Use this to your advantage, smoke in and do it solo, and then translate that into tower pushes. A quick tip if you're playing an illusion hero, or have a Manta Style: your illusions will disappear upon attacking Roshan, but not upon being attacked. Go into the pit, position your illusions in front of him but make sure not to command them to attack him. Attack him with your hero and back up. Your illusions will then tank the damage. Use this to your advantage. 




 I saw that, but it's not like it's a bad pickup on PA without evasion on the other team. Getting it before Abyssal is definitely questionable though.

edit: Just looked again, it was most likely to avoid Tinker's Laser miss chance. 




  However, I cannot stop my team from fighting when I'm in no condition to fight yet.

This is unfortunately an unwinnable battle. If they cry that you're not participating, go participate. You'll die, and they'll flame you for not being able to carry. If you ignore them and keep farming, they'll flame you for farming when you need to fight.

You know the real answer. Keep farming until you have the items necessary to be able to fight. Or, do what I do, and TP in at the very end of the fight to get a triple kill clean up crew style and get flamed for kill stealing and not being there from the beginning.

 




 Kotl is nothing but food for the current meta heroes. 




 Ghost Scepter. 




 Add Abaddon and CM to the list. Abaddon because of heal and shield, and CM allows PA to dagger from range without worrying about using all of her mana pool, while also providing her Freeze if enemies decide to go on you. 




  We need wards.

 We need wards.

 We need wards.

 We need wards.

 We need wards.

 We need wards.

 We need wards.

 We need wards. 




 Just report lifestealer and move on. Nothing you can do. The community will always be toxic. 




 This was completely not worthy of a thread.  




 So I can be yelled at more often for not buying wards as a solo support when the 4 insta pick carries are farming each lane past the river and our jungle? No thanks. 
























 Literally Magnus' worst nightmare. 




 Linkens is the old build for mana and a bit of survivability early. I usually go Manta before Skadi because it helps you farm faster, or at least picking up the Yasha. 




 The TEAM needs a carry. Yeah you'll win a couple cheeky games with 5 supports but that's an extremely small percentage of games. 




 The bench. 




  Banning pick is a much more balanced choice!!

MMR leader bans the 3 hardest counters to his hero, goes mid, stomps game.

So balanced. 




 Obvious troll post detected. 




 Two melee against a QoP/Undying? Hell no. The more people in a lane the better for Undying.  




 Then you have Fear on a safe lane farming Clock? PPD fucked up. He drafted two combinations that are great on paper (void+wd and storm+omni) in team fights, but drafted himself into a corner where Empire were able to draft lane dominators and completely shut them down. Even if the roles were switched, neither side lane core would have gotten any farm. Razor+1 would have zoned the shit out of both Clock and FV, and QoP+Undying is super strong against a tri lane consisting of two melee with no hard lockdown if you wanted to run a tri lane.

Empire saw their weakness and exploited it hard.  




 Bloodstone/BKB gives you survivability but zero control or damage. The issue was that Razor got the Diffusal way earlier than anyone on EG expected, and it wasn't revealed. So the mid team fight where repel was diffusal'd off and Sumail died in static storm took EG completely by surprise. 

 Linkens is nice i guess but there is plenty of mechanism for poping it

Linkens after Orchid would have given Storm damage, control and more survivability because with repel on, the only thing that could pop linkens would be the diffusal. And if diffusal is popping linkens, the repel stays on, therefore negating the need for a BKB but still retaining your magic immunity.

 Get bloodstone , use the repel and the bloodstone range and hp to take fights early (20 to 25 min where i believe storm has his biggest power spike). Then go for bkb

Yeah, at 20-25 minutes is when the diffusal came up if I remember correctly. He was fucked at that point. 

EG got outplayed and slightly outdrafted. In hindsight, the only thing they could have done with that draft would have been to secure Storm an immediate Linkens to avoid Repel being diffusal'd off. Then into Orchid and Bloodstone. A lot of space would have needed to be created by the Fear/Aui combo however, and that didn't really happen.  




 Make his ult cooldown 60 seconds instead of 30. Fuck being able to take 3 lanes of racks in 90 seconds at minute 35. It's bullshit. 




 No it wouldn't. He'd still be as dominant as he is now, you'd just need a +1 to Rosh and you couldn't take 3 lanes of racks in 90 seconds. 




 The main advantage that using Edge Pan over WASD gives you is that you utilize those freed up keys for other things. Namely, control groups to make playing micro-intensive heroes much easier. 

I use a mix of Edge Pan and WASD. I have my camera speed up really high, so if I need to move my camera to the left, I can tap A and it will move it where I need it to be. I've also remapped some hotkeys to make hitting important keys easier (Q attack command, E stop command, 123456 spells, ZXCVFR items). 




 CARRY FUCKING TP SCROLLS 




 What if they made the Cooldown on Troll's ult 60 seconds instead of 30? Would that be too much? 




 Dagon/Eblade was so much more fun though. Stacking ancients on Radiant was easy, you could do it by yourself. That patch was when I first learned how to really play the hero and it was the most fun I've ever had. 

Funniest moment though had to be when a Bloodseeker was on the other team and I wasn't paying attention around the 10 minute mark, farming up a quad ancient stack spamming Soul Ring and March without remembering that he could see how low my health was with Thirst and he ran over and 1 shot me.

Good times. 




  55% wr 5k mmr

Dotabuff? 




 Someone needs their pacifier.  




  Thanks Volvo - proof that ~~you are screwing me with bad games and worse teammates~~ i suck at this game. 




 wut 




 Kotlguy is miles better than Zyori.  




 Ice Armor is probably his best skill at this point. 




 If someone abandons in a stack, the whole stack loses MMR. Problem solved. This would prevent one player from abandoning to save their stackmates from losing MMR. 




 Had a game a couple days ago where our PA abandoned 30 minutes in, while it was still a pretty even game. I was playing Beastmaster, so I just stuck PA on myself and ran around. If a team fight broke out, I Blink Roared and stuck my Boar/Necro units on their Troll and played the PA from there, because honestly what use is a Beastmaster after you initiate besides summoning another Boar and maybe throwing out a Wild Axes or two.

We won 8 minutes later. You can definitely still win if someone abandons, just micro their hero.

Your suggestion is good though, but you need to make sure that if people are playing in stacks, if someone abandons in the stack, the whole stack gets -25 MMR, but not the other players of the team. This would prevent a player from biting the bullet and taking the abandon to save their stackmates from losing MMR. 




  same anoying problem.

They're the same MMR as you. 

You have an unranked MMR just like ranked, it just isn't shown. This is what determines what ranked MMR your calibration matches are played at.  




 Having your waves continuously push into their T3s applies pressure that they constantly have to deal with. This leads to openings for your team to find the key pick offs that could give you the opportunity to break high ground. 




  instead of just dismissing it like they do now in 60m+ games

Just because it doesn't get put on the 1 position doesn't mean it's useless. Aegis on position 2 or 3 can still be huge, as well as Cheese for a support. Also, denying the other team the opportunity to take Roshan is huge as well. 




 On the account I use now: 65% 20 games with PA, 64% 14 games with Drow, 63% 35 games with Troll.

On my previous account: 67% 66 games with Bloodseeker, 65% 29 games with Viper, 61% 33 games with Crystal Maiden. 




 1.) Consider 2-1-2-1 if you think you can solo kill at 6 with Vortex or get a good rune. Maxing Overload first is best because that's where most of your damage comes from. Remnant or Vortex next can depend on your situation, but usually Remnant for flash farming.

2.) Ganking as Storm is rough early on because his zip uses a lot of his early mana. Best to farm your Orchid as fast as possible and go from there, unless you find a good rune (Haste is best, DD is okay, Regen is pretty great if you know how to use it).

3.) You can but it shouldn't be necessary unless you're losing your lane.

4.) Not 100% on this, but what I usually do is Zip in, use Orchid while in Zip, Overload attack, Vortex, Overload attack, Remnant, Overload attack, Zip behind them, Overload attack, repeat. 




 Juggernaut isn't all about his ulti. Yeah, it wrecks, but you're also talking about if he's ulting 1 person for WW or illusion heroes. If you're in a 5v5, he's bouncing around to everyone. Illusions help mitigate ult damage, but he's so much more than that. Also ignoring the fact that when he leaves it, he has magic immunity in Blade Fury, a really strong AoE healing ward that isn't always easy to spot and a built in crit, plus is extremely dominant and powerful in every stage of the game, as opposed to other carries like Spectre, AM, Dusa, Weaver that take a lot of farm to hit their peak. Jug gets strong at 10 minutes and doesn't fall until like 50.

 oracle,winter wyvern,earth spirit,bane.

All very high skill cap heroes. You can't just tell someone "play Oracle if they pick Troll". Someone who doesn't know how to play Oracle will end up fucking up more team fights than they assist in. Banes the same way. If you aren't good with Bane, you're probably going to do more harm than good by misusing Nightmare or Fiends Gripping at the wrong time and getting interrupted immediately. The only people who should be playing Earth Spirit are above 4k, otherwise you're going to be useless. It's like a 2k picking Invoker. Yeah you might contribute and win against equally terrible players, but you're not actually playing the hero correctly or to full potential. 

Read the last line of my post: 

 It takes pairings and coordination to win against these heroes, and that's the hardest part about pubs.

Against Tinker it was easy. Pick Storm, hunt him down. You barely need to know how to play Storm to accomplish that goal. Zip into the trees after he blinks, interrupt his TP, watch Tinker cry because there's not much he can actually do at that point. Void? Disrupt/Swap the carry out of chrono if they got caught. That's literally all you needed to do to be the hero. DP? lolblademail. 

The problem now is that you have to pick a combination of like 3 different heroes to actually play against their one hero. That sucks in pubs because not everyone can/wants to play those heroes.


 




 Nice try. 




 Puck is in a perfect place right now. Pretty sure nothing needs to be changed. 




 Give me a direct hard counter to Troll and Juggernaut.

edit: That's as easy to play as those 2 heroes. Winter Wyvern comes to mind, but it's generally considered a higher skillcap hero than Troll or Jug. 




 At least Tinker and Void took a way larger amount of skill though. A shit Tinker in the Dagon/Eblade days (which I'm assuming you're referring to) was useless. If you were a good Tinker, yeah you wrecked shit. He became one of my favorite heroes during that patch. 

In this patch though Troll, Sniper, Juggernaut are so easy to play. Also there are direct counters to Tinker, Void and DP. Troll has no direct counter. Juggernaut doesn't have a direct counter. It takes pairings and coordination to win against these heroes, and that's the hardest part about pubs.  




 Until he pops ult and bkb bash locks you. AM isn't a particularly tanky hero. If you're down to a 5 second bkb, he's almost guaranteed to get two bashes off during that time span, which means one disable after AM's bkb is over and AM is done for.

The problem with Troll is you have to draft an entire team just to deal with him. He doesn't have a single hero counter. There are two ways to win against a Troll. Either shut him down so hard during the first 15 minutes that he's essentially a non-factor (pretty hard to do in pubs), or draft a lineup purely dedicated to kiting him around during team fights (even harder to do). 

 This is coming from a lowly 2.2k scrub too...

Okay, well at 2.2k people barely know what they're doing in the game. I've been there, it's pretty bad. I'm over 3k, and yeah I've seen some horrible Trolls that were easy to beat. But in the hands of somebody who actually knows how to play the hero, it's devastating (i.e. a game I played as Troll a couple nights ago where we had mega creeps sub 20 minutes.) If you're able to hit your timings, the other team has to pull out a miracle to beat you. 




 If I'm SF, I'm not letting the support Omni take a DD rune because my bottle is full. 




 Did your Storm Spirit have a Bloodstone? If so, upon his death, the Bloodstone healed you. 




 All you have to do is face the other direction for a third of the duration. It's not hard. Everything in this game has a counter. If BKB didn't have things that countered it, it would be grossly overpowered. 




 It's not. The formula is (n/k) = (n(n-1)...(n-k+1))/(k(k-1)...1)
where n is total amount of heroes and k is the number of combinations you're trying to find. 




 If you're talking strictly on 1 team, I believe it comes out to 122,391,522 possible combinations. 

For both teams, you're looking at 4,689,764.

Math done using the formula for finding the amount of combinations of 5 card hands possible in a 52 card deck:

(n/k) = (n(n-1)...(n-k+1))/(k(k-1)...1)

where n is total amount of cards (heroes in our case), and k is the number of combinations you're trying to find.

(110x109x108x107x106)/(5x4x3x2x1) = 122,391,522
(110x109x108x107x106x105x104x103x102x101)/(10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1) = 4,689,764 (rounded up from a decimal). 




  The meta does not apply to under 2k MMR.

Yeah Pugna could work in sub 2k. Any hero COULD work in sub 2k, because people have no idea what they're doing. But if you're talking about the meta, which applies to players who actually know how to play the game, Pugna doesn't fit well.
 




  my 4th and 5th ability slots (T and G) and my Stop command key (H)

Wut?

I use a mix of Edge Pan and WASD with no real issues. 

WASD camera move, Q attack command, E stop command, ZXCVFR items, 123456 spells, SPACE hero select, TAB select all units, CAPSLOCK control group tab, TGBH specific control groups.

The biggest thing removing WASD camera movement helps you with is heroes that require you to micro throughout the game because you can use those 4 keys for control groups. I hate playing micro heroes in the first place because they're not my style, so I never found that to be particularly useful.

Switching to Edge Pan won't automatically make you a better player. Does it help for specific heroes? Undoubtedly. But it's not some remedy to boost your MMR up by a thousand like reddit likes to imply.

Good luck though! 




  rarely

What other heroes do you see Mek on though? Enigma and Chen are the only two I can think of off the top of my head. Viper Mek is still built but it's not that great any more. 




 The meta does not apply to under 2k MMR. 

But the answer is no. Pugna's nether ward is great against a few heroes that need to use high mana cost spells often in team fights (Tinker, for example), but since not many of those are in the meta, Pugna doesn't really have any other uses. Early 5 man hard tower pushes are less effective than they used to be, and that's what Pugna excels at. Aside from Nether Ward, he doesn't provide anything in team fights. His AoE is okay but you need to be basically on top of the enemies to use it, which is bad for Pugna. Decrepify is too situational to really warrant picking him, and his ult is a channeling spell that can be easily interrupted before it does any real work.

 




  TL;DR: Would Dota 2 benefit from much shorter matches? 20-25 minutes?

Not sure. Maybe you could ask everyone that watched TI4.  




 Yeah the mana cost is too high. That's why it's rarely built any more. 




 This confirms the fact that I'll never be able to play Invoker.  




 EG, Secret, IG, VG, LGD are 5 for sure.

The next 5 aren't as easy.

C9 should get one. Rave should just because they need to direct invite at least one from SEA right? So that's 7.

Asus and Empire could receive invites but are kind of on the brink. Alliance has been showing up big recently, but on the brink as well. Navi definitely isn't getting one. 

EG, Secret, IG, VG, LGD, C9, Alliance, Asus, Empire, Rave are my prediction if there is 10. 




 The problem with Peruvians on US E are that you have people from a poor and very uneducated 3rd world country queuing with people from arguably the most developed nation in the world. If you don't speak English, or can't understand English, you shouldn't be allowed to queue for a server hosted in a country that speaks English as its default language in a game that relies heavily on communication and coordination.

If I went to the South American servers not being able to speak Spanish or Portuguese I would be in the wrong. If I queued for SEA without knowing any Asian languages, I would be in the wrong. 

There are 3 servers hosted in South America. I'm sorry your country is a poor shit hole and you get worse ping to SA servers but you're ruining other people's games just by being in it on US E.

If Valve region locked, the gaming community that queued for US E would be a million times better than it is now.  




 Depends on how many Chinese teams get direct invites this year. If they do 4 again like last year, 3 are already most likely taken by VG, IG and LGD. Who gets the last spot? I'm assuming either Newbee or Ehome, but probably Newbee because they are defending champs. 









 I still think this game would be far better with region locking. I don't care if my queue times go from 2 to 6 minutes, I want games where my teammates speak the same language as me. If my preference is US E and English, I shouldn't be matched with people from 3rd world countries that don't speak English.

I'll gladly pay for it. 




  44.21% Win Rate

Ok 




 As much as I like the idea, I don't support it. He's one of the last heroes I want to see picked more often in pubs. 




 Well you can set R to autocast I'm pretty sure, that would make your life a ton easier. 




 You were probably reported in addition to the abandon in other games recently. I've abandoned games before with no low priority.  




 It's extremely cookie cutter at the moment. Can't wait for 6.84. 




  i want to treat that game liek a regular game

There's your problem. Just afk NP cliff jungle until it's over. Low priority has three types of people: Those who abandon because of an emergency/internet/power failure, those who abandon because they raged and those who get excessively reported. 

If you fall into the first category, you're a minority. Just get through it as quickly and effortlessly as possible. 




 Well, kotl/ds would be pushing the wave insanely hard. If you were safe lane, you need to practice last hitting under tower. If you were offlane and they were pulling, you're basically fucked and picked the wrong hero for the situation. 




 Not sure why you're downvoted, this is pretty much correct. Just had a game in 3k where our PA randomed, and went completely naked BF. Took him 13 minutes and he ended up abandoning later after he tower dove and he died. Only reason he wasn't completely shit on was because his babysitting Dazzle stacked 2 camps like 4 times and he got like 2k gold in the span of a minute.

We still won though so I wasn't mad. 




 That's where I'm stuck. I climbed from 2.6-3.2 in a week and couldn't keep winning. Haven't dropped below 3k again yet but shit got rough.  




 They don't really need nerfs though.  




 I've noticed that if I go on a winning streak of 5 of more games, instead of being equivalent to the average MMR for the server, i'm 50-75 points, sometimes even 100 points below it. Now obviously at 3k that's not a massive difference in skill, but it's strange that it doesn't keep you equivalent just because you're winning, that it puts you up against what it sees as higher skilled players. It's like it's trying to make you lose. 




 Ignore Lamza, he's nothing but a griefer in this sub. 




 Well that's annoying. Thanks though. 




 I don't understand why sometimes I click the enemy hero and I DON'T aggro the creeps. It's really frustrating in mid when I'm clicking, and even walking towards the enemy hero trying to aggro the creeps to get them onto my ramp and they don't move unless I'm basically past them.

Can anyone explain why this happens? 




 People are stupid, that's not going to change. You don't remove a mechanic just because stupid people don't understand it. 




 Try not clumping up around heroes that thrive around clumped up enemies. 

Spread out a bit if you're pushing a tower. Have the supports hang back to not get caught in a blink echo and counter initiate.  




 You're playing a ton of different heroes. Try sticking to one or two that you're most comfortable playing. I'm 3k, and I have the best success when I spam pick two or three heroes that I know I'm best at, rather than trying to play everything.

Obviously it gets boring playing the same hero over and over, but it's a suggestion. 




 Also Lycan 




 Troll, Juggernaut, PA with either BF or HotD, AM with BF, Luna, Bloodseeker, Slark.  




 I used to rush Skadi on Weaver mid back when I was first learning how to play. Literally brown boots into Skadi, then Butterfly, and then I had like 20 kills and the game was over. 

Shit was hilarious. It was like 1k MMR so I had no idea what I was doing. 




 I don't. Fuck Riki. 




  specific help with Viper

Build Shadow Blade, Press R, spam Q, get kills. He's probably the easiest hero to play.

Obviously his build changes at higher skill levels, but for a beginner that's literally all you need to do. 




 Phase Shift - Dodging anything with it is just fun and hilarious. Huskar ult? Sike. Assassinate? Nope. Laguna Blade? I've done it. 

Toss - Always a fun time. You can cliff enemies with Toss. Had ally Storm zip up there and wait for an enemy to come check rune by Rosh, I Blinked out, Avalanche, Tossed them up, ally Storm Spirit zipped away. It was a Shadow Shaman before he got Blink and he was there for like three minutes because we camped out the enemy jungle while we pushed bottom lane and he was too scared to move the courier past us.

Black Hole - Mostly because every time I use it I scream BLACK HOOOOOOOOOOLE into the mic as loudly as possible. 




 I used to play CM exclusively in 2k. It took me forever to realize, but people in 2k are way too retarded to be able to play CM correctly. 

Maybe I'll try it again if I break 3.5 or 4k, but if I tried to captain, nobody could play any good heroes effectively, the combinations never worked out, and even though I tried to communicate the plan, nobody followed it. Example: carries building midas when I drafted a hard push strat. And if I didn't get captain we got a mish mosh of stupid heroes that didn't synergize at all and got stomped.
 




 If you force him into jungle before HotD you have a far better chance of winning though. 

I'm no pro, but whether i safe or mid I can get Aquila/Phase/HotD and level 11 (all you need to solo Rosh) by 12 minutes. With a Rosh and 4 towers, I've got SnY by 15. By then, you need to fuck up pretty hard to lose, or get massively outplayed. BKB and maybe another item by 25-30, another Rosh, and go end the game.

If you shut him down in the first 10, it takes a while to recover though. 




  even if I was doing well

If you're not being pressured, you're probably going to do better than someone who is though. 




 Basically this. The hero is a broken pubstomper right now. Learn how to play him correctly and you're probably not going to lose unless the enemy team commits their first 15 minutes entirely to shutting you down, in which case pray someone else on your team can make good use of the massive amount of space they've been given.

I'm 3k and I can end games with Troll in 25-35 minutes. Rosh between 10-15 depending on farm and levels, group up with Aegis and mow down the outer towers, repeat when Rosh respawns for mega creeps. Had a game yesterday where we got megas sub 20. Shit's broken. 




 Buffing assist gold wouldn't break the game in any way. That's all I'm saying. 




 Well, 5 of the 7 heroes you just mentioned have built in escape mechanisms or delays of some kind (Astral, Zip, Ghost Walk, Sprout/Teleport, Untouchable) already. If they're caught out without this by a carry, evasion isn't going to save them. 

As an Int hero, you should be positioning yourself so that you're not taking right clicks in the first place. Int heroes aren't front liners. They're supposed to stay in the back or off to the sides casting out their spells and inflicting tons of damage.

If you're in a man fight between a Lina and a Spectre, a little bit of evasion isn't going to swing the fight in Lina's favor. 




 The point is that supports need to be more appealing for a player than they are now. Right now, the far majority of players want to play carry because carries get to have all the gold, items, and get to kill everyone. Carries also posses a far higher snowball potential than supports. "If you really want to raise your MMR, pick a snowball carry, outfarm the enemy team, and win the game solo." It's much harder to solo win the game as a support than a carry, but easier to give your team the capability to win. 

Supports will always lag behind in farm and levels, and are usually the first to die in teamfights because of that fact. Also, they're dying first in team fights BECAUSE they're lagging behind in farm and levels. If you die a couple times as a carry, you can easily recover. If you die a couple times as a support, your next item could be another 10 minutes away. 

Who enjoys playing a hero that gets jumped on and 2 shot by a carry? 

Also, the comparison to a quarterback is false. In the over 1,000 games I've played, 90% of them contained the mentality that "I'm the carry, do what I say because I'm higher level, more farmed and more powerful. Buy wards feeder you're 1-6-12 noob." Obviously competitive play is different than pubs, but playing support in pubs usually sucks massive cock. 




 That's actually pretty false. Considering your carry is going to be farming all of the creeps, if you get a kill, regardless of who the killing blow is landed by, the carry (assuming they're in fine enough shape to continue farming) is going to have easy cs until the hero returns. It's far better to give kills in the first 15 minutes at least to the supports than the carry. 




  If you want gold and KDA play carries.

Great strategy. How are all those 5 carry lineups working for you in pubs?

 




 100% pick/ban material.

edit: Oh wait I just realized we already essentially have that in game. It's called Battle Trance and affects your entire fucking team. 




 Ghost Scepter is essentially the Int evasion item. It's rarely something you build on a carry, and most Int heroes want to avoid as much physical damage as possible, and don't really right click anyway. 




 As a carry. If you play him support he needs to be position 4 for Blink, but if you max Sprint and Stun you can still get into fights for your ult and the stun.

Not saying it's something I'd necessarily advocate, but with the correct lineup it could work.

It'd be equivalent to a Wraith King support, although WK does the job a bit better. 




  Also if you cant get higher on your "main" in trench then you wont get higher on a smurf either.

Not necessarily true. My main was at 2.0k when I decided to make another account. I didn't know at the time that it took your hidden MMR into account from level 1-13, so I didn't take games too seriously, played drunk a lot, and used the smurf to try new heroes. Calibrated at 2.6k, and have risen to 3.2k in the month or so since I calibrated. 

Even if you're playing better than your level, it might not be good enough to solo win enough games to really raise your MMR.  




 Proof? 




 A Huskar ult'ing your face is the last thing a Sniper wants to see. Especially if the Sniper has his MoM up. 




 Exactly. Played multiple games where an Io started relocating our carries into the enemy base because they're Peruvian shit and they cried about it for the next 30 minutes instead of disabling help.

Even though I told them multiple times how to do it. This community is garbage. 




 Started at 1.8k, at 3.1k now. Read guides, and ignore your team during games and follow the steps from people who are 5k+.

They're at 5k, you're at 1.4k for a reason.

Also watching pro tournaments with good casters helped me a ton. 




 Change Focus Fire to a buff for WR instead of only on a single target. 

Soooooo cash. 




 This fits my prediction of Pure Damage heroes becoming 100% pick/ban for TI5.

Icefrog plz 




 Have you played pubs? It's very rare, at least at 3k or below (the people who are making the threads, by the way), that you get 5 people coordinating during the draft to pick a lineup that works together or is a counter to the enemy team. You're far more likely to have 4 insta locked carries and a fight over who is left to support. 




 Because reddit likes to make threads every hour crying about losing to Troll or Juggernaut. 




 Wow a 90th percentile player can beat ones of lower skill? I'd never considered that. Also considering reddit loves to throw around the sentence "Everyone at your MMR is just as good/bad as you are", your response fails to hold any weight. Yeah, we outplayed them. And I'm making the thread to show people who come in crying about losing to Troll or Juggernaut every game a strategy to rectify it.

Also the average player isn't 3.2k MMR if it's also the cusp of High Skill. That doesn't make sense. 




 And yet people make threads every hour crying about how to win against Troll/Juggernaut. 




 It's 3.2k MMR, it may have been 50 or so shy of the cusp to High Skill, because that's where I'm hovering at the moment. 




 3.2k MMR, it was just below the cusp of High Skill. 




 They ran a PA safe solo, Jug jungle (so far 0% win rate in the 10+ games I've seen, yet people continue to do it), Troll mid, Brew/Lina off with Lina supporting against our aggro tri with Specte, Sniper mid and LC top. Realistically, they should have gotten their farm no problem.

And I'm not surprised, I knew we had it from the start because they were pretty terrible. But the point of the thread is more to let people know that come in here crying about Jug and Troll every five minutes that all you have to do is play a certain style and you'll be fine. 




 Wrong!

http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1369562180

They ended theirs with a Lina/Brewmaster. Our team picked up Sniper, Spectre, LC, CM, Dazzle (yours truly).

Weave murdered them. Sniper built a Deso and I grabbed a Medallion just for insurance. Constantly aggressively warding their jungle allowed us to roam and get pick offs with LC duel and Spectre Haunt if needed at every opportunity, transitioning into immediate tower pushes. We only lost two towers and their farm was stifled hard from the get-go.

So if you're wondering how to beat the draft possibly most indicative of the current meta, there you go.

edit: Game was around 3.2k MMR. TL;DR: Kill the heroes before they're farmed, Dazzle +/- armor destroys physical lineups.

 




 I leave Dota open on my computer for days at a time even if I'm not playing, so I don't judge by hours played.

My first account, the one I learned on, has 1,226 games at 2.2k MMR. I got put at 1.8k when I calibrated because I did it at 13 immediately and still didn't know jack shit about the game.

The account I use now has 350 games and I'm at 3.2k. 




 This was a nightmare when I lived with my parents. If my dad was watching Netflix, it was near impossible to play Dota.

Since I've moved out, the only problem I've noticed is when my Android phone tries to download updates for apps during a game and my ping jumps up by 250. It blows ass because usually I don't notice that's whats causing it until the game is over, and my poor self can't afford amazing internet in the first place. It's actually so bad that if I'm trying to watch Youtube and I have a Facebook tab open it's near impossible. So if I'm playing Dota, Dota needs to be the only thing using my internet or it's laggy. 




  the difference between 1.7k and 3k is pretty marginal.

I have 2 accounts. One is 2.2k, one is 3.2k. I only play the 3.2k now, but I hopped on the 2.2k last week to see how it was. 

Went mid QoP 3 games, shit stomped them and won all 3.

The difference is actually larger than you think. 3.2k is the cusp for High Skill. I'd wager to say it's 80th percentile. Average is probably 2.2k. So you're a top 25% player going against below average players. It's completely possible to win solo provided you pick the correct hero for it. Are you going to win 100% picking Omniknight? It's possible. But your chances are higher picking something like QoP, Troll, Storm, SF and snowballing.

 




 Maybe for someone of a higher skill caliber. 

Same thing applies to someone at 4k. It's really possible to stomp 4k games by yourself if you're 6k. 

Why aren't you 6k? git gud 




  If you're not winning more than you lose, it's because you're not really as good as you think you are.

He's not asking "Why is my MMR so low". He's asking for help. 

 All you have to do is be better than 1700 MMR players

This is such a stupid response. No shit you have to be better to win. He's asking how. 




 Learn how to farm, pick Troll Warlord. Your MMR will go up by 1000 in a week. 




 It's gonna be something like this, or a base movespeed reduction by 10 and scaling to his Q for health, armor and damage instead of staying static.

Personally, I would be okay with them just removing his Bash and letting him build Skull Basher but that probably won't happen. 




 Picking Troll for ez MMR 




 His games are in Very High Skill, that's at least 3.7k 




 K 




 Depends on how high you go. You're not going to go from 2k to 4k unless you're a 4k player in the first case. However, spamming one hero allows you to get comfortable enough with that hero that you're not worrying about your movements, skills, builds, or what to do in teamfights and can focus on learning the mechanics of the game, learning how to farm properly, map awareness, etc., which then can translate into your other heroes as well.

And considering this guy is low 2k, he still has a lot of those mechanics to learn.

I went up from 2.5-3.2 by basically spamming Troll and PA. However, my skill level is competent enough with a few other heroes that if I don't play those heroes, I can still perform 2-3 heroes effectively in other roles.

Everyone will tell you that it's not best to try and learn every hero from the start. It's best to learn 2-3 heroes very well per role and pick them depending on the situation. 




 Yes. You should stop playing immediately. 




 I didn't say she was better, it's just what I always see.

I'm assuming for the evasion. WR definitely isn't my first thought when I see a Troll on the enemy team, but inherent evasion does make Troll build an MKB if he cares that much about killing her. She definitely has the potential to fuck him up with a long duration shackleshot into an Aghs Focus Fire if you weren't able to get your whirling axes onto her, but most people can't pull it off effectively at 3.2k.

Until he gets MKB, she is capable of just pressing Windrun and TP'ing away, so maybe people pick her to avoid getting solo killed. 




  Just make sure you have a few other heroes, in preferably other roles as well, that you can play to an equal skill level if you aren't able to get your spammed hero in a game.

Bruh. 




 3.2k checking in. Lina is the number 2 counter pick to Troll instapickers, behind WR. 




  it's incredibly stupid.

The other side of the argument to that is that you should play what you're best at. If you're best at 1 hero, spam it. Just make sure you have a few other heroes, in preferably other roles as well, that you can play to an equal skill level if you aren't able to get your spammed hero in a game. 
























 Really the only thing he's useful for against Troll right now is that FG pierces BKB. But the downside is that Troll usually uses BKB at the very beginning of a fight when his team's disables are all up, so good luck getting the full channel off. 




 First off learn how to farm with strong carries. Troll, PA, AM are three good examples right now. If you learn how to play these heroes well, and can hit 5 cs/min on a consistent basis, your MMR will go up by a thousand. Under 3k, the carry that has the most farm wins. While your team is busy team fighting across the map after the 8 minute mark, you should focus on getting as much farm as possible with the space they are creating for you. Ignore them when they call gg at 15 minutes because you're not participating in fights. They're stupid, and that's why they're under 2k. 

Get your farm and only participate in fights if the fight is under YOUR tower, allowing you to tp in instantly and get a couple clean up kills if you are able. The biggest mistake people make in sub 3k is fighting before their hero A.) has enough farm or B.) hits their peak. It is a complete waste of time to go into a fight, die, and lose time you could be farming another big item. 




 Saw the other post about what heroes have never been in the meta, and it got me wondering what actually defines a hero as being "in the meta"? 




 Even if Eul's gets nerfed I doubt we'll see less Lina. It'll still be a setup for her stun and her ultimate is one of the strongest in the game, especially with Aghs. 




 Go into the draft with a game plan. "Counterpick the enemy heroes" is a terrible plan and you shouldn't do it. You might be left with a team that has no synergy, horrid lanes or that has varying different timings that could screw you over. However, counter picks should still be utilized. Did they first pick a Batrider and VS fits into your game plan? Get it. 

Your players need to have 3-4 heroes that they can comfortably play in case a hero gets banned or a counter has already been picked. If they don't, then they need to learn them or they're a liability to your team.

Watch pro commentaries on drafts. They'll explain why the teams drafted the way they did, and it can give you great insight. 


 




  They mostly play sniper troll jugg and sf

Then they need to expand their hero pool. That's their problem that they can only play the easiest (aside from SF) and currently strongest heroes in the game. Not yours. 




 I've actually experimented with Blink instead of Force. If you have the chance to Astral yourself, the cooldown on blink means you can blink out of a self-Astral. Also makes initiating with Astral far more reliable.

The downside is you lose a bit of early damage and the utility. 




 Support players would have instant games. 

Carry players would have 15 minute queues. 

Mids would be 30. 




 Knowing when to gank is huge. If you're 3.6k you're probably past the 8 minute "gg mid no gank" calls, but getting a Haste rune on someone like TA or Storm should be an easy 1 or 2 kills for your side lane and you should take advantage of that. 




 Never really got into the hero too much, but I know the basics. 

I know it's always a good idea to leave a Remnant behind you for an escape if you get ganked while farming. However, if I go to throw another on a hero to initiate a gank on them and use Activate, it goes to the one that's far away before the one I just threw.

Is it a mechanic that it will always go in the order that you send them or is there some way I could ignore the first I threw to only move to the second? 




 Part of getting better is learning how to win with stupid teammates and against equally stupid opponents. You'll figure it out. 




 Someone made a thread yesterday tracking the MMR between his calibration matches. The first 4-5 games bounced between a 500 or so MMR range. 




 PL just got a rework. He doesn't need another.

 I say we should nerf Radiance.

Radiance isn't core on PL any more.  




  Essentially

I thought I remembered seeing pro's in the area between 5 and 5.5k so that's why I did that. But really I don't think the difference between 5 and 6k is large enough to warrant making a separate bracket for 5-6k. Considering there are only ~600 people actually above 6k if I remember correctly. 




 0-1k = How did you even turn on your computer

1-2k = You're not good

2-3k = Average

3-4k = Getting better

4-5k = You're probably top 10%

5k+ = Essentially pro status 




 It doesn't already do that? Why not? 




  We can't mute you during the draft stage

That needs to be changed. 




 At least make sure your trolling reply is something that could be real.

0/10 




 That'd be cool. 




 I got queued last night with 5 solo on my team, 1 solo and 2 stacks of 2 on the enemy team. Hardly seems fair, but my team still won so I can't complain. 




 People will buy the arcanas and still play the heroes.

Duh? 




 Isn't the point of Hex to be an instant disable? Increasing the cast time would defeat the entire purpose. 




  I tried my best to carry

 but he let us down as bristle. 

I was Spectre.

5-14 sub-200 cs in a 46 minute game

 Either shut him down so hard in the first 15 minutes that he isn't a threat (he really isn't that great if underleveled and underfarmed), kite the shit out of him in team fights with Force Staffs/Slows or get BKB-piercing disables (Fiend's Grip, Primal Roar, Black Hole) and focus him down immediately. 




 God I love this video. 




 Someone probably made fun of him at school and he took his anger and humiliation out on anonymous people on the internet. 




  The fourth game I also played sniper with even better performance and I got nice team too and I won the game.

So what happened to your MMR after the 4th game then 




 It's the same concept as rushing Linkens on Weaver. It's not exactly what you want to get first, but it's not the worst thing you could buy. 




 I dig Beastmaster, would be a cool buff. 

Also to anyone reading, Primal Roar shits on Troll Warlord. Hang back, wait for his BKB/Ult, Blink in and Roar him and sick your boar(s) on him. Works best when his BKB gets to a lower duration but you get the point. 




 So when I was rising from 2.6k-3.2k over the past month or so, I obviously didn't win every game. But there were times where I'd win 5,6,7 in a row. Fuckin awesome right? Ez 200 MMR. Well then I noticed something. Instead of being almost equivalent to the average MMR of the server (which most people are at 3k-ish), after a winning streak I was actually 50-100 MMR behind the average of the server. This happened after every streak of 4 or more wins (which there were a few of). So after a winning streak the system was actually putting me up against theoretically more difficult opponents (even though the difference between 3.0k and 3.1k is negligible) than what my supposed skill level was, because I was winning.

Just found it strange.



 




  PL is a better Troll Counter.

Absolutely. 

Would it actually be worth it to build a BF on Troll if you're counter picked by a PL? It would screw up his entire item progression and timings though. 




 If Sniper goes MoM before BKB, he's never going to get the chance to build Skadi or MKB. Have you seen a PA crit on a MoM'd Sniper? It's fun stuff. A naked Phase/MoM Sniper is ridiculously squishy. One crit from a Treads/Aquila/PMS PA that early on is over half of Sniper's health. And since there's no bkb, and also since the cast range on Phantom Strike is greater than Sniper's attack range, PA shouldn't have a huge problem getting in.

If Sniper goes BKB before MoM where's his damage coming from? He doesn't have the Skadi slow yet, nor the True Strike from MKB, nor the attack speed from MoM. He has protection, sure, but PA can easily kite out BKB charges since the Snipers doing next to no damage.

And when they are finally slotted, like in the average teamfight you mentioned, the PA wouldn't just try to run to or away from the Sniper. If Sniper BKBs before you get the jump, you Phantom Strike out to an ally or creep and wait out his BKB. If your team is initiating, you should really be initiating a first instance of lockdown ON the Sniper, since the Sniper is the highest value target, leaving room for PA then to BKB and jump in. If the Sniper isn't jumped, imo, it's not a good enough initiation to commit to. Wait out the 5-10 seconds, and if the opportunity is still there, the Sniper is dead.  




  might as well say "you can win by playing Troll"

Troll spamming is the easiest MMR I've ever gotten, yet it amazes me that people actually can't play him correctly. Honestly the hardest thing about Troll is having the game sense to know when to switch between Melee/Ranged axes depending on situations. PSA: If you're chasing someone down, switch to melee for extra move speed, switch to ranged to attack, switch back to melee to chase, switch to ranged to attack (hoping to proc a Maim or just get the Skadi slow on them), etc. until you catch them if your whirling axes aren't available. 

Trolls super easy. If you can't win with Troll, you don't deserve to go up in MMR. 




 How would you build the Sniper then?  




 I went from 1.8k to 3.2k in about a year. Over time you'll steadily get better. 




  their names

 some notable people

I love how specific you are. 




 I really want to see Oracle added to CM before TI5. 




 There are way too many variables and what ifs.

Essentially the answer is whoever gets the jump first. 




 Force Boots, Soul Ring, Euls would be every support's first 3 purchases. 




  could be

Not saying it is, but considering I have no idea what the average reddit MMR is, I wouldn't be surprised if it were high.

That's interesting though.  




 Congratulations, you picked two heroes out of the possible 108 others that have a spell immunity piercing disable. Magnus, Bane, Enigma, Beastmaster, LC are ones too.

But what if your team is Sniper, Skywrath, Phantom Lancer, Tidehunter, Witch Doctor? No BKB piercing disables there, unless PL builds Abyssal.

Also a good PA will wait until the Axe or Clock initiated elsewhere to jump the Sniper. 




  Why would you let him reach you to being with? stun him.

Then he buys a Blink Dagger or BKB.

 Unless he comes charging at you with bkb, then run.

His W gives a Slow debuff if it lands. Two core items on him are SnY (Maim chance is a Slow) and Skadi (built in Slow). You don't run from this hero. Kiting him requires teamwork and coordination or heroes with escape mechanisms. 




 He's the best 1v1 fighter there is due to ridiculous attack speed steroids, and a built in bash that pierces spell immunity. Capable of reaching near max move speed with Phase activated. He's also arguably the best pusher in the game right now due to his Ultimate giving attack speed to his entire team on only a 30 second cooldown. One of the best STR gains per level for Agi carries as well. Oh and he has a Slow and a Blind. Being able to switch between melee and ranged doesn't have any downsides. He can solo Roshan after level 11 and HotD (minute 12-15 depending on how your laning phase went) and he's strong at every stage of the game. 


 




 A PA and Sniper battle with equal farm should always be won by the PA. The Aghs upgrade does damage, yes, but Abyssal is core on PA to lock down the Sniper and the only way someone will stop you is with a BKB piercing disable. A team won't always have one of those. 




 I've played from 1.8k-3.2k in my time of Dota 2. While these elements are still prevalent in 3k, this describes 2k far more accurately at least for US East. 




 Spectre is a really weak laner in a meta that favors strong laners. Naga is the same way. Tusk is situational. Spectre and Naga don't pressure Sniper in the laning phase, which is when he needs to be shut down. 




  they will just blow you up as soon as you blink to sniper

Ever heard of a BKB? 
 




 You described 2k way more than 3k. 




 You could have too many different outcomes depending on item builds and RNG for an answer. 

If you had said SF has item, item, item and Storm has item, item, item it'd be a bit easier. 




 Out of almost 11 million unique players this last month, you honestly believe that there are 5.5 million players above 3k MMR? 

 Reddit

Yeah, slightly over 200,000 people (out of 11,000,000) that are known for being completely biased and forgetting that we're not even 2% of the community. 

The average Reddit MMR could be 3.5k, I'd agree with that.

 some notable people

Got a link?

A year and a half ago, the 90th percentile was 3k with 5 million players. 500,000 above 3k. So now you're saying that out of the 6 million new players since then (assuming the original 5 million are counted in the current 11 million), 5 million of them are above the skill level that would have put them essentially at pro status only a year and a half ago? 

K. 




  3.5k (the norm)

The average player is more like 2.2k. Considering the dotabuff cutoff for "High Skill" is 3.2k, it wouldn't make sense at all for the average player to be above that. 




 If you're the best player on the team, you need to play a hero that allows for the most solo kill potential. You absolutely cannot rely on your teammates at that MMR. You need to be able to do it all yourself, and the easiest way to do that is by playing a high impact carry. For example, I guarantee at that level people can't grasp the concept of not stacking stuns. At higher levels it happens on accident, but it's very common to see 2 or more stuns thrown on a hero within a seconds time span, instead of chaining them for longer duration. 

The easiest way to win is by getting more last hits than the enemy. If their carry has 10 cs at minute ten and you have 50, ignoring any kills, towers or runes you have 5x more networth than them. That's around a 2000 gold advantage. Keep farming until minute 20 at the same pace, you now have 100 cs at minute 20, where they might only have, hell probably 25. In that time span they went from 500cs gold to 1250. You went from 2500 to 5000. Couple that with some solo kills and making sure you don't die, and after minute 20 you should easily be strong enough that sub 2k coordination will not be enough to kill you. Easy win. 

TL;DR: Farming efficiency is what separates low skill players from high skill players. Learn how to farm, and you'll easily jump to 3k. 




 Congrats? 




 Prefacing this by saying I'm talking about pubs, not pro scene.

It's even more unpopular now that 5 core strats are arguably more viable than 1 carry 2 cores 2 supports. Supports do their best work in the first 15 minutes. Ganking mid, pulling the safe lane, early wards/courier, securing your cores' farm while also hindering the enemies', etc.

However in this patch, getting your team an early advantage is actually bad, because each kill the enemy team will inevitably get will give them more and more bonus gold due to the comeback mechanics. The fastest game I've ever won was as Troll a week or so ago. We got megas sub 20 minutes after I destroyed their mid and the enemy team gave up. Other than that, games are going at least 35. That's 35 minutes for a team's 5 carries to farm, defend high ground AND get EXTRA gold from kills due to your advantage. 

Also factor in that carries get to farm for the big flashy items, do the most damage and are more easily recognizable for "glory" per se, whereas in pubs supports are seen as ward bitches, you can see why they're the minority. 




 Mute whoever is being toxic. Engaging in a flame war will do nothing but take focus away from your play, hindering your ability to either stay in the lead or make a comeback. If they're retarded/Peruvian, there's nothing you can do about it.

Stick to pings and chat wheel. Only type if it's to discuss strategy, and even then keep it brief and to the point.  




 Lina is picked a ton. Not on Lion/Venge status, but she is also capable of filling two different roles. 




 Yeah no shit. Sniper has easy counters and first picking it allows them to pick any and all of them. 




 What game? 




 The problem in team fights though is that once the RP is dropped, those heroes are dead. Omni would be good but if you're playing against a good Magnus he'll either wait out the GA or make sure to get Omni in the RP. 

As far as countering it though, obviously you're not going to outfarm the Troll. Do you just split push around it really hard? Limiting the Mag's impact will work a little bit but he doesn't even need to max Skewer. 4-4-1-1 at level 10 and your Troll is golden. 




 Something I've been wondering recently. From what I've seen in the pro scene, Trolls almost always banned. But in the games he gets first picked, why isn't Magnus an immediate second pick from the same team? I know he doesn't NEED Magnus like CK essentially needs a wisp for example, but that combo seems way too strong to pass up.

To add to that, Trolls also almost always picked in pubs. If you're the Troll picker, try and convince someone to Magnus. Even if they suck at RP'ing, the Empower flash farm opportunity will skyrocket you. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1403320471

Or, if Troll isn't your thing, learn Magnus. The hero doesn't need a ton of farm for this combo to work, just a Bottle, Blink and Mana Boots. Your main goal is just to steroid your carry. After your core items take it upon yourself to do the Ancient stacks, since relying on supports to do it is generally not going to happen. And if you're a good Magnus that can land 2-3 man RPs consistently, it doesn't matter if your Troll is bad (Manta and SnY on the same hero, way to go). Put Empower on him and it's a triple kill in 5 attacks. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1400871942

I'm only a lowly 3k but the top game is a new record GPM for me. I'd wager to say this is currently actually stronger than Drow/Visage and far easier to execute. I don't think I've lost with this combo yet, playing either the Troll or Magnus. But eventually I'm going to play against it, I can already feel it. So, how do you counter it?  




 Have you tried turning it off and back on? 




 Disruptor, Batrider or Enigma in my opinion. 




 Just make sure to spend it before you die. I have two buttons on the side of my mouse, one is hotkeyed for mic and one is for quick buy. There's nothing worse than finally having enough gold for that last Ultimate Orb and getting ganked and not being able to complete your item for the next 2-4 minutes.

Assuming you won't need to buyback, anyway. 




 Only have it on Auto Cast when you're positive you won't get jumped (i.e. when he already jumped someone else.). 




  immediate after radiance

Yeah that's stupid.  




 Mid should gank given the correct opportunity. It's not their JOB to gank per se, but if there's a Haste rune and a side lane wave is pushed to your tower, that's an opportunity to gank and you should take advantage of it.

Also, everyone on reddit knows this. You're preaching to the choir.

 




 I love OD. One thing you may have forgotten to mention was that his Q adds Pure damage. This is extremely powerful against Agi carries (and Axe) because the damage isn't reduced by their armor. 

I experimented a bit with Blink instead of Force Staff. The synergy between your W and and cooldown on Blink means it's a far better personal escape mechanism than Force Staff. You do however lose the utility of Forcing teammates and a bit of damage. This also means that if you save W for personal defense, you can usually easily escape from the middle of a team fight to go to the back lines and keep pumping out damage. Also great for BlinkAstral to initiate on someone. 




 They are usually heroes that depend more on levels for effectiveness rather than farm. Usually initiators.  




 End the game before Spectre is farmed enough to be able to carry. 




  You didn't need BF because he should have been Empowering you.

 




 Scale it to 1/2/2/3 charges per level.  




 Your build sucks. Aghs BF Jug isn't good. Yeah the argument is there for the RP combo, but look at their heroes. Magnus is best against a heavy melee lineup, of which they only have 1 (not counting Timber and Tree because they shouldn't be right clicking you anyway.) You didn't need BF because he should have been Empowering you.

Your money would have been far better spent on MKB/Abyssal. 




 Yo mamas so fat that she only buys Tangos.  




 No. Her agi gain is half of Troll's and has half his base armor at level 16. Considering she needs PhaseAghsDaedalusForce/Blink before she's truly strong, that's zero armor items. She'll melt to any real carry if she's locked down. 

I've had no problems playing against WR as Troll. All you have to do is either buy MKB or kite through her evasion and then bash lock her.  




 Gyro is a terrible mid. His attack range is garbage, and if you're maxing Missile you're forgoing abilities that help you farm, of which he needs a lot of to be effective. 

He'll lose to any mid with good harass that runs a bottle. Kunkka, SF, Sniper, TA, QoP are 5 that come to mind instantly. 




  (i was playing meepo)

Against a hero whose biggest strength is single target physical damage. There's your first problem.

 (in my opinion she's equal to troll)

Troll provides an attack speed steroid to his entire team as well as a built in bash, aoe blind and aoe slow. WR provides skill shot lockdown, a magic nuke, evasion/maxMS/slow provided you run over them and an attack speed steroid to herself and only on a single target. Troll farms faster and is a much lower skill cap. 

Looking at the dotabuff, if you had jumped her you shouldn't have had a problem killing her. If she jumped you, you're dead. That's how the matchup works. Just because you lost to it doesn't mean it's overpowered. 




  It's "not a fun and friendly atmosphere" he said.

Welcome to online gaming. 




 Spectre, Clock, SB, Axe, Nyx, PA, LC, BH kinda. 

Basically anyone that can get in his face and hold him there while dealing out heavy damage. 




 If you're taking racks and you've won a team fight, it's usually best to back off if the enemy buys back. Unless you're massively ahead or still healthy enough to fight, it's super bad to get killed by heroes that bought back. 

 




 The only part of Dazzle that gets countered by Axe is Shallow Grave. Actually, if you look at his 3 other skills, Dazzle is more of a counter to Axe. Shadow Wave is great for a heal bomb if Axe calls teammates and creeps. Weave helps your team against his physical damage and can reduce his armor. Poison Touch is meh. But since his core items include Force, Euls, Medallion, maybe a Mek, he's not bad at all. 




 I'd make them confused, disarming them and making their hero move randomly for 2/3/4 seconds.  




 I've done this. It's great. 




 Just randomed Magnus, essentially commanded someone to get Troll. Other picks were Sniper, Omni and LC jungle. Proceeded to roflstomp them for 40 minutes.

lolthismeta 




 From what I've experienced, it's better to have lackluster supports rather than a lackluster carry. 




  easy counters

Oracle, Bane and Winter Wyvern are the first 3 that come to mind. 

Oracle is an extremely high skill cap hero. If you don't know how to play Oracle, you're probably going to do way more harm than good. Bane is in the same boat but less so. Misuse of Nightmare can easily lose you a teamfight, and without proper positioning and game sense your FG can be immediately interrupted. Winter Wyvern is okay but still takes a rather large amount of game sense.

It's way harder to play those heroes as counters to Troll or Jug than it is to play a Troll or Jug. Aghs Lina and QoP are good because of their Pure Damage Ultimates but otherwise aren't much.

And as for Sniper, he's nowhere near as overpowered as people like to claim. Shrapnel early on is insanely strong but he's still basically a glass cannon. Get in his face and he melts. 




 Magnus, Troll, Drow, Visage, VS.

You can sack Magnus in the offlane because his main contribution to this lineup is Empowering the Troll for flash farming ancient stacks and just the threat of an RP. 




 "GG MID ITS MINUTE 8 NO GANK PLZ REPORT"

 




 I calibrated in Oct '13 at 1.8k. Peaked over 3k once about a year later, but fell back down to 2.2k.

Recalibrated on another account in February at 2.6k, hovering between 3 and 3.2k currently. Just takes time. 




 Yes, in which case you should play supports that don't lack that potential. The best way to improve your MMR is to get good at high impact heroes. While some people can improve by playing support, it's generally easier to get really good at snowball mids or carries that farm quickly and have great kill potential. 

 




 What's sad is that 5 carry strats are arguably more viable than 1 hard carry, 2 cores and 2 supports. 

You lose the first 20 minutes super hard but turtle for another 20 because pushing high ground is stupidly difficult and reap the comeback mechanics to push down one lane and end the game. I'd like to see statistics for this patch, if possible, for how many teams actually lost the game even though they took all of the outer towers first (excluding games with a Troll because he can take 3 lanes of racks in 90 seconds).

It's stupid. 

 




 Ventrilo is the bomb.com

Yeah if DDOS is such a problem because of Skype, I don't see why people are still using Skype. Do tourny rules make you use Skype? 




 Is it worth still picking up a casual Yasha for farming speed or is that what the MoM is for? 




 I know it probably varies depending on the game, but what is the current best item progression for a Dusa? I usually take her mid, and I run RoAPhaseYashaSkadiMantaBfly. Not really sure where to go after that, I'm assuming MKB or Daedalus? 

Also, what should the skill build look like? I only keep 1 point in her ult after 6, and max Snake and Mana Shield first. Should I forgo Snake for stats? 

Ty. 




 Skadi is the fotm item for sure, next to MoM. It's a great pickup on almost every carry.

Rapier should only be bought as your last ditch effort to win. I had to buy one last night as Medusa because we were 2 racks down. Hid it from the enemy team, they tried to push for the 3rd racks, we team wiped them and marched down to win the game. I actually ended up losing it to their Mirana but we'd already taken megas and they couldn't push out. 




 Wait for the next patch.

In all seriousness nothing in the first 20 minutes of the game really matters. Even if you stomp all 3 lanes, if the enemy team has any semblance of high ground defense you're going to lose your entire advantage if they win a team fight while you try to take racks. 

The best thing to do in this patch is gear for late game no matter what. Unless you have someone like a Troll that can go from 3 racks to 0 in 2 minutes, you're going to have to play to win around the 40 minute mark.  




 I got a 729 gpm game on AM last night after I'd been drinking. Considering I'm 3-10 on the hero on this account, and my only wins have been while drunk, I think I know who to stick to after a few beers. 




 It's not a hard hero to play necessarily, but it's a lot harder to play well than Troll or Sniper. Misuse of Nightmare can royally fuck over a team fight. Knowing when to use Fiends Grip takes a lot of game sense too, because you either need to wait out all of the other team's disables or position yourself perfectly to avoid it being immediately interrupted. 

Not saying he's the highest skill cap or anything, but he takes a lot of game knowledge to play well. 




  theres a reason hes first pick pro material.

Uh, maybe a couple patches ago. I haven't seen a first pick Lycan in months.

inb4 THIS ONE TEAM DID IT THIS ONE TIME LIKE A WEEK AGO 




 Troll can easily outrun Razor with SnY/Phase. In late game he can also murder the Razor before too much damage is stolen. Really isn't that good of a counter. 




 Juggernaut. I don't know why, but for some reason I just can't win games if I play him. 




 The problem is that the counters to Jug, Troll and Sniper (all extremely easy heroes to play) are heroes that have pretty high skill caps. (Winter Wyvern, Orcale, Bane, for example).

Any retard can pick Troll and win a game in 30 minutes. But if you give that same person an Oracle they're going to royally fuck up. That is what sucks about this current meta. The strongest heroes are the easiest to play. 




 No. 




  I've played hundreds of games against Pudge and I still royally suck against him.

Dude all you have to do is watch where he moves and put creeps between yourself and the Pudge. If you don't see him, drop a shrapnel on the high ground. 

Pudge mid only beats bad Snipers. If you're a bad Sniper, your biggest issue is positioning. 




 Uh, SKs burrow has atrocious range, if you see WK running at you to stun you should just back up. If you're don't, you're bad.

Axe is one of the top 3 offlaners at the moment, but your range should be fine unless they tower dive you. 

Boots first and maxing Take Aim solves these problems, by the way. 




 If you're getting hit by stuns you're playing it wrong. If you're not mid, max Shrap and Take Aim before Headshot. There's no way the enemy should get to you. If they do, you're doing it wrong. 




  This is 2k so we're both going to misposition every once in a while.

That's not really an excuse. Sniper shits on Pudge mid. Use Shrapnel for vision on his high ground if you have to, but you should definitely be able to position yourself well enough to avoid hooks if you're a half decent player. 




 Tri lanes are great for people who know how to run tri lanes. It took me a long time of captaining CM in 2k to realize that at the time I, nor any of my teammates, actually knew how to properly run a tri lane. 

Sub 3k, if you lose the laning stage, just keep farming until you get the items you need to fight. It is absolutely wrong to enter teamfights before you're ready, as most of the time you'll die and further set back your progression. It takes a lot of practice, game sense and knowledge to know when to enter a fight. In sub 3k, people will be tower diving at 15 minutes. This provides great opportunities to TP in at the end of a team fight and potentially get a couple clean up kills, but you have to be careful about it. 




 That's no fun. 




 You shouldn't be playing her anyway, that's kind of what I'm saying. 




 Nyx's Mana Burn, Frost Nova, Purification, Multicast.

I win. 




 If anyone is having trouble actually killing this hero, the best tip is to save him for last and control him throughout the teamfight. Silence him, euls him, sheep him, kill everyone else around him and go for him last.  




  Does anyone build refresher abaddon?

I doubt it. It would be an extremely luxury item considering there are so many other items that he would want before that.

I mean I'm sure people HAVE but it's not really something I see as viable. 




 Troll and Bloodseeker. They're both so easy to play, it kind of just isn't fun. 




  tri-laning

 bottom of 2k

Terrible suggestion. 

1. I highly doubt people that low know what pulling is. 2. I even highly-er doubt that they know how to do it correctly. 3. You're going to end up pushing the wave under the enemy tower giving them free xp while your carry is zoned out of last hits and splitting xp three ways. 4. You're probably going to try to dive tower because omg 3v2 advantage and die. 5. Your offlaner is now in a 1v2 and will probably feed. 

I'd recommend building a Poor Man's Shield for agility carries. Stops a lot of early right click damage harass and boosts your damage a bit for trading and last hitting. If nothing else, definitely pick up a Stout. Practice last hitting under tower. Lower MMR people miss a ton of essentially free last hits because they don't know how to last hit under towers. Control the creep equilibrium by going for denies. Usually you want the creep wave closer to your tower. It's worse to die than to miss out on some cs. If you're way too pressured, just hang back and soak xp. There are some offlane combinations that will be absolute hell to deal with no matter what carry you pick, especially low 2k where you can see anything. Sometimes you can let them take the tower, and 1 or both will rotate away to pressure other lanes. That frees up the lane for you to freely catch up on cs. Just don't die, play safe, and secure as much cs as possible. 




 I was able to bait out a Dream Coil and a Warlock Golem with two separate illusion runes in the game I just played.

Felt so good. 




 The people at 6-7k aren't mentally handicapped.

There's your thread. 




 I cry every time I see someone midas rush her in the jungle in 3k. So useless. 
























  When do you report?

When I'm running towards a rune Alt Clicking my empty Bottle but our support takes it before I get there.

 Probably whichever hero has the closest lore ties to Arc Warden, considering Zet is most likely the next hero to get ported.

 I think unfair bots should be a challenge for experienced players. I was practicing Earth Spirit this morning against unfair and had zero problems dominating, on a hero I've played maybe 3 times. 




 Be insanely overpowered. 




 Earth Spirit isn't even hard. 




 Slark. I see him stomping my pubs every day but whenever I play a Slark game I massively suck. No idea why really, just can't seem to make any impact with him. 




 Playing a broken hero doesn't mean you're good. All of the troll pickers who spammed him for +1k MMR are going to drop like a rock after 6.84. 




 WASD camera move, 123456 spells (if you can't hit 5 or 6 easily, that's a personal problem), ZXCVFR items, Q attack move, E stop command, SPACE hero select, TAB select all units, CAPSLOCK scroll through control groups.

Works fine for me for every hero that I play. Micro heroes are not my style at all, so I tend to avoid them. Micro'ing is still a challenge, but I've played Chen and Meepo with a bit of success in the 3k bracket when I've randomed them.

I also do use Edge Pan a bit. 




 So denying towers are great because it denies the enemy some gold. But should you deny T2 towers? Obviously nobody cares about T1 towers because your glyph will reset and they don't matter that much, but a T2 tower I feel is way more important to leave standing even if it only has 100 health. If that T2 is up, the enemy can't take your racks in that lane if they've pushed through in another. Yeah even if it's only 100 health it isn't hard to go take it, but that's still an amount of time spent that brings your team closer to respawning or getting into a position to defend, etc.

And definitely not T3 towers, yeah? Thoughts? 




 You never really *want* to build a BKB on Storm.  




 Zeus doesn't really beat Sniper in lane, and does nothing once Sniper gets BKB.

If you're able to coordinate a couple ganks on Sniper, snowball ahead of him and get a fast Blink, you can hunt around the map nuking him down whenever you see him solo, but otherwise Zeus is hardly a counter. 




  the damage is negligible.

12 damage per second, for ten seconds, with three charges, assuming you're in each shrapnel the entire duration.

That's 360 damage. Hardly negligible at level 1.

Actually I think he's pretty balanced. He has great early game magic nukes, but once you get BKB he doesn't do any damage to you at all. After carries have BKB his biggest use is free dewarding and vision ultimates. 




 The only ones shorter than 20 I've played were due to an abandon. I've had a decent number of games between 20-25 minutes, all with Troll Warlord. 6.83 in a nutshell. 




 They have your same skill level with a tenth of the amount of time played. I'd rather be matched with them than you. 




  The idea that "bad players are holding me back" is just an excuse people use to make themselves feel better.

The idea that it's easy to solo win every game at your skill level is false. Can a 6k solo win 2k games? Yeah, no shit. You're a top 1% player going up against average ones. It SHOULD be easy in that case. But can a 3.5k solo win every game in a 2-3k bracket? No, they can't.  




 The top heroes this patch have remarkably lower skill caps than top heroes of previous patches. 




  they can hear everything the casters are saying

Pretty sure anything the casters say, the players have already thought of. 




 Quick note to anybody reading, Magic Stick/Wand will gain a charge if a neutral creep inside the range uses an ability.

The more you know. 




 WASD camera move, 123456 spells, ZXCVFR items, Q attack command, E stop command, TAB select all units, CAPSLOCK scroll through control groups, SPACE select hero. I do use Edge Pan in addition to WASD.

I can't play Meepo and Chen amazingly because I don't have set keybindings for control groups, but I've played them in 3k and actually didn't fare too badly. 




  Weaver The Swarm movespeed increased from 600 to 800.

I'd rather see his Str gain increased from 1.5 to 2.2 




 A lot of your item builds are retarded, also you abandon a ridiculous number of games. Fix those, play carry, secure 5 cs/min throughout the game, don't feed, and you'll go up by a thousand. 




 That's what Ranked SHOULD be. Ranked should be for tryhards, unranked for casuals. That's the point of the separation.  




 Tiny against Troll is only good until Troll gets BKB. Once Troll gets BKB, Tiny melts. 




 Troll already has mana problems early game unless he builds Aquila or runs a Bottle. It needs to be a very small mana cost. I like the idea, but weakening an already weak part of the hero isn't the answer. You need to nerf the strong points a bit to bring balance.

The 60% Blind chance on melee axes needs to be reduced, I'd say to 40% would be fine, as well as remove flying vision of ranged axes. That really should be enough.  




 Your friend is shit. 




  Add a small-ish mana cost to switch between ranged and melee forms

That would destroy the hero, unless it was like 5 mana. 




 The front page will be filled with "Fuck this I'm not playing Dota 2 any more" threads. 




 Yeah the 1.6k net worth lead that the Radiant had at their highest point caused SO much of a swing.

Idiot. 




 Beastmaster shits on Troll. Roar through BKB and I believe the Boar's effects go through BKB. 

The problem with Troll in pubs is that it takes a lot of coordination to shut him down. You can't man fight him like other carries, you have to spend a lot of resources between multiple heroes to shut him down early and also kite him during teamfights. 




  melee heroes CANNOT lane against storm,

There are a ton of heroes melee heroes can't lane against, that doesn't really mean it needs a nerf. Ever tried melee against SF? Or Sniper? Or hell, even a SK? 




 Usually I only leave 1 in spin the whole game to use strictly for magic immunity, and max crit and stats taking a point in ult whenever possible, taking healing ward if we're looking to push towers or team fight, so I don't really have that problem. But I do play a very little amount of juggernaut so I'm not anyone to take advice from. 




  but that's not a pick-up PA often gets.

70% winrate on PA in pubs. I never build BF.

Literally embarrassing to see other PA's build Bf and ultimately fail at carrying the game.

edit: To anyone reading, the way I've found to best build PA is PMS(if needed)AquilaTreadsHotDBasherBKBAbyssal/MKB(whichever you need first). By that time the game should be over if you do it right. You should easily be able to get Basher sub 20 minutes, and your level 11, which means you are outputting massive amounts of damage. Treads/Basher gives you a nice little bit of health too which never hurts, and nobody has MKB yet so your evasion will be a great saving grace. Then you get BKB, take Rosh, and essentially end the game. 




 Their lina has more last hits than him. That's pretty bad. 




 Ursa jungle is picked fairly often in my pubs. If I start the game with 2 sentries, which camps would be the best to block? 




 Saw Era doing it in a game, and occasionally in my pubs. What is the advantage of Treads over Phase? 




 Just a tip, they're called Heroes in Dota 2.  




 WASD camera, Q attack move, E stop command, 123456 spells, ZXCVFR items, SPACE select hero, TAB select all units, CAPSLOCK scroll through units.

Works for me. I still use Edge Pan in addition to WASD though. 




 I got the Mythical Warlock set the other day. I hate playing Warlock. And it's not tradable.  




 Pretty sure that only applies to people above 4.8k, where the teams can range from MMRs of 4.5-7k. 




  2.3k mmr

 Captain's Mode

There's your problem. Don't play CM in anything less than 3.5k. It took me forever to learn that when I was in that bracket, even if I did pick Captain every game. People in 2k can't play every hero. You need to be able to play every hero to be able to be useful in CM. People will go in and say "Pick me x" even if x doesn't fit in your lineup at all, and they refuse to change because they have a very small hero pool. So you're either left with a team that has zero synergy and stupid lanes, or a team of heroes that work great together but nobody can adequately play. 

Your captain was terrible though. Going into CM and not banning Troll when the enemy team had first pick? And also letting Magnus through to the very end? First two bans Silencer and Medusa? And picking offlane Ursa? Yeah, he's trash.
 




 Okay so Storm is one of the heroes I love to play, and in team fights can play very well, but can never seem to control a game with. I see his potential in the hands of people who can play him to the highest level and try to replicate it, but I always seem to fall short. 

I know the builds and how to play him and everything, but what I struggle with most is hitting item timings. How long should I solo farm mid before I go around trying to set up kills? I usually go Bottle  SR  Treads  Orchid  Bloodstone, and don't think I should really be ganking until Orchid, right? If I get a Haste rune or DD or something obviously I can take advantage of that, but if I don't start ganking at minute 8 my team rages and loses morale (3k MMR). Do I just ignore my team and flash farm the Orchid and go around getting kills after that? I feel like my mistake is trying to gank too early, dying, and then delaying Orchid, but I can never get my team to understand that.

wat do 




 Sven needs MoM/BKB/Blink before he's really useful in any way unless your team has great initiation, in which case you can forgo Blink. SnY after MoM would just delay the BKB too much. 




  I feel like their skill is alot better than mine.

Well yeah. They play(ed) this game professionally for money and huge prize pools. They're literally the best of the best. 




 How do you think? 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIjZImAyoKs 




 430, xboct, zai, alohadance, puppey

Pretty much my 5 favorite players to watch at the moment. 




 Flawless logic. 




 IT's not wrong necessarily but it's not the most efficient build. Your passive gives your way more damage than the extra second or two of the pull would. If you're going to be strictly ganking, then the pull helps, but you need passive and remnant for farming to get your Orchid/Bloodstone faster to have more impact in the mid game. 




 Definitely Puck with Blink and Euls. Lol just try to kill me. 




 http://www.dotabuff.com/players/206703220 




 This is wrong. You always max the passive first. 




 I use the [Logitch M510](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BcyeIQuSL.jpg). It's wireless too. Works fine for me. 




 Compared to Troll, Jug, Sniper which are in almost every game, he takes way too long to come online and doesn't beat them late game. I CAN play him, but it's much harder to actually win a game because of the current meta. 




 That would be insanely overpowered. The movement speed increase on top of her E means the need for Phase/Euls is gone. This would mean Aghs/BKB rush, making her completely immune channeling Exorcism in the midst of a team fight plus her AoE silence. No thanks. 




 I'd rather have the choice to mute them myself than have them automatically be muted. I don't give a shit if they flame, it doesn't bother me. What I care about is any tidbit of information they might share that could beneficial that I can't see because they're muted. 
 




  could also be considered a buff in some situations.

Which is fine. Vision scouting assassinates? It has a very low cooldown. It's a change that has both positive and negative outcomes, which is, from what I've gathered, what Icefrog prefers to do rather than just a straight up nerf. 




  valve is basically doing us a favor by muting them.

I'd rather the player just be sent to low priority than being muted in a Ranked game I'm trying to coordinate with my team to win. 




 But the current system also punishes the other 4 members of their team, which is completely unfair. Instead of muting, just send them to low priority. Muting is stupid. 




  "This will just lead to people threatening to feed if they arent unmuted by their team"

If they're starting off muted, how would they threaten anyone? You'd have to unmute them just to see what they're saying. 

I'd love to be able to manually unmute someone. I don't care about stupid flaming. If random people on a video game are making you upset then that's a personal problem. If I can tell none of their communication is going to be helpful, I'll re-mute them. The current system screws over the other members of their team moreso than the person that's even muted. 




 Make Assassinate a skillshot similar to Powershot. His skill cap will rise without changing any other skills, and it would actually fit the style of the hero more than Q Q Q R LOL KILL. 




 Make Assassinate a skillshot like Powershot. Then Sniper will be balanced, and actually far more interesting to play/watch. 




  this patch has the greatest variety I've seen so far and I love it.

Did you see the thread the other day where the guy replied to your dotabuff with statistics for % of meta heroes picked per game? For me personally, there were 90 out of 108 games that included Sniper, Axe, Jug or Troll. Add Lina to that and you'll probably hit 108/108. This patch isn't diverse at all. There are a large number of heroes that simply completely suck right now if the other team has 1 or 2 of the "Big 5". Weaver is my favorite hero. I can't play him if I want to win because he's essentially useless, and that's a big problem. That applies to a large number of heroes in the pool. 




 You had 4 heroes that are easy food for a Troll and your Spectre didn't outfarm him. 




 If the enemy 5th picks Storm and you don't have lockdown, yeah you're in for a horrible time.

If you have two separate silences and two stuns, the Storm is in for a horrible time.

 




 Especially not one of Viper honestly. That hero is probably the most boring to play, and I'd imagine also the most boring to watch.

Get me a good Puck game and I'll totally watch it. 




 I support anything that comes from Curse. Got me so right on my WoW mods over the years. 




 I don't understand why they don't just switch to something other than Skype. If Skype is the issue, why are people still using it? 




 You're only smurfing for the first few games, and that's only if you clicked "I've never played Dota 2" or whatever the option is. If I remember correctly, checking the inverse option puts you immediately at 3k hidden MMR. It takes over a hundred games to get to 13 to even be able to play ranked.  




  First of all 3,2k is the MMR average

It definitely isn't. 3.2k is the cutoff for "High Skill" on dotabuff. It's illogical to consider the average player "High Skill". Average MMR for the almost 11 million unique players of this game falls somewhere in between 1.5k and 2.5k MMR. We're on an online forum dedicated solely to the game that encompasses less than 2% of the community. 3.2k is most likely the average REDDIT mmr, but not the community as a whole.  




  Love this guy's personality

He's a typical teenager on an online game. Nothing is unique about his personality. 




 Same principle as why you turn off your basi/aquila ring in the laning stage. It buffs the creeps, which you don't necessarily want until you want to push the tower. 




  pretty sick of 4kmmr and troll jugg axe all day

So you'd rather play 2kmmr troll jugg axe all day?

That's stupid. 




 To everyone reading: the WORST time to gank a side lane is when they're already losing it. The WORST thing you can do is harm yourself and your progression by potentially feeding yourself and more kills to a side lane. Fuck your side lanes. It's not your job or your problem. Only gank if YOU see the opportunity. 




 I've been told I'm being reported in almost every game.

Haven't gotten low priority in months. Although I did get a 24 hour mute the other day.

If anyone's reading this, do you think the system takes into account how many successful reports you submit against reports submitted about you? To simplify that, I've reported a lot of players. Usually for flaming or trolling. A high percentage (I'd wager over 70%) of these reports I get a notification later that action was taken against the player. Does this mean if someone reports me, that I don't get looked at as harshly by the system? Maybe a "good samaritan" sort of thing? I kind of doubt it, but that would be kind of cool. 




  through a concerted team effort

This is the problem. At 1 or 2k, there is little coordination. At that MMR, it's suicide to rely on your teammates. It's far easier to do it all yourself. 




 The issue with picking a support is that you're a space creator. This means the space you're creating has to be taken advantage of. Someone in 1k will not be able to adequately do that. Even if the support sets up 5 different kills in the first 10 minutes, if the carry isn't using that space to efficiently farm for some actual items, then it could end up being useless because the carry is unskilled and could miss all of their cs and feed it away later.

 




 Definitely mid. If a 5k mid picks something like SF, TA, Troll or Storm against a 2k mid, you're going to see a 40cs difference at 10 minutes plus a couple kills. The 2k mid won't have anything, rendering it completely useless, while the 5k mid will start the snowball that will make him invincible for the rest of the inevitably short game.

This happened the other night, a 5k smurf on my 3k team went mid with Earthshaker and ended up 30-1. His only death was because we were fountain diving after mega creeps. 




 I had the thought that it could give every member of the team Fervor as well. Wouldn't be a huge upgrade, but Troll doesn't need any more upgrades at the moment. 




 Lol? Every Aghs upgrade is a buff to the skill in some way. 




 If you're a halfway decent player, all you have to do is pick one of four heroes and you will win pubs.

That's the problem with Dota right now. 




 http://www.dotabuff.com/players/206703220

3k USE 




 Trolls the best. Unless they have 3 carries and your only carry is Troll, if you snowball, you're not going to lose. 




 I personally have two accounts, one is 1k MMR less than the other, and I haven't touched it in months. I recalibrated with another account and rose up.

If I logged onto that account, it would be smurfing.  




 That it's the mid's job to win the side lanes. 




  Zyori

 Really good casting

I doubt it. 




 Elder Dragon Form.

Because who wouldn't want to be a fucking dragon? 




 Depends on what being a noob is considered. I don't consider myself a noob in the sense that I know what every hero/spell/role does and what I should do in specific situations.

However, I'm still a noob in being able to properly mechanically execute what needs to be done correctly every time. 




 A lot of people are saying last hitting, but specifically last hitting under tower. 

Also pulling the safe lane correctly. 




  and you have you the moron who picked earth shaker and have no problem to buy both wards and courier at min 0

What 




 Early game you needed to not go solo. This does make farming more difficult, but also safer. You needed to prevent him solo ganking heroes across the map and snowballing, and the best way to do that is to have a buddy with you. An underfarmed Riki will not be able to kill two heroes. 

And yes, you needed Dust. You'll not ALWAYS be with the Slardar, and nothing is worse than having an invis hero get away with 100 health because you didn't have detection. 




  i dont see the motivation of this.

The motivation is that the queue time will be drastically reduced because naturally more people want to play carry. And people who would do it don't care that they're lessening the experience for other players. They're selfish and think they're the best, and nothing will change that. 




 http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1408390254

This game went 58 minutes, 3k MMR. I was Radiant. Dire absolutely stomped the early game and built early shadow blades on ganking heroes, making farming essentially impossible as they constantly inhabited our side of the map and took our towers one by one. Around 25 minutes we'd lost all outer towers. We didn't leave the base for the next 25 minutes. We turtled. Turtled so hard that our Silencer got an abandon even though he was completely playing. It wasn't fun. It was boring as shit. But every time they pushed high ground we repelled them. And then they made the mistake of getting caught in Rosh without buybacks by a smoke gank and we pushed down mid and won the game.

It was stupid. We shouldn't have won at all. They're equally stupid for not building BKBs now that I actually look at it though. But still. 




 Somewhere between 3.2k and 3.5k I'd say. 




 QoP doesn't "counter" Tinker per se, QoP is just a natural lane dominator.

You shouldn't have had any problems against Disruptor.

Silencer counters everyone that relies on spell usage. 

None of these heroes should have been able to catch you out while you're split pushing, and in team fights you shouldn't have been in a position to get caught by them in the first place. 



 




 The easiest way to win sub 3k is to gain a massive networth lead via farming on a strong carry in the first 25 minutes and avoid dying. Fuck fighting, fuck defending unless somehow they're pushing T3s. If the enemy is 5 manning your T1 bottom, solo split push the T1 top. T1s mean nothing in that bracket. When you're sufficiently farmed, let your teammates be your tanks, go in after big abilities are used and clean up the rest of the heroes because at that point they can't stop you. Follow that up by pushing down objectives and taking Roshan. Rinse and repeat until the games over.

 




  1.5k isn't bad

No offense, but yeah it is. You're pretty below average. 




 C9 might have won a TI. 




 Jesus. Dota would actually become a horror game genre. 

Had a game the other night where I was playing Drow and went to Silence a solo hero, only to have an Axe blink right in front of me the split second I did. Made my asshole clench and a loud expletive left my mouth as I dipped the fuck out of there, but holy shit that would be scary in first person. 




 I really hope Oracle gets added. Would make TI5 way more fun to watch. 




 You need to jump him with an instant stun so he doesn't have time to react, and chain stun afterwards. Puck is very squishy. 




 For me it's gotta be IG vs. VG. The individual skill of all of their players is amazing and it's never disappointing. 




 Pitlord 




  It's like saying chrono is better disable than dismember

Well, it is. 




 If you have more towers than the opposing team, you should have map control. This means that it's unsafe for the ENEMY to farm and contest Roshan. 

Also, unless your team got completely dominated in the fight (something that probably wouldn't have changed if you were there), split pushing requires at least one enemy hero to TP back to defend. This means that any following objectives for the enemy are harder to get. 




 I'd rather see something implemented to where I can choose to not be matched with a player again. Over the past week I've gotten the same guy who randoms first pick and gets a carry, and proceeds to suck ass with it in at least 5 games. 




 Tiny is the hardest carry because he's made of rock. 




 The object of the game is to take towers, and eventually the ancient. If the enemy team wins 6 team fights and takes 0 towers, and you participate in 0 team fights but take 6 towers, your team has the advantage. 

And, if the enemy team wins the team fight and takes a tower, it's better that you took a tower for the trade instead of potentially going to the fight, dying, and having no upside. 




 I'd pick Magnus against it and have a field day. 




 That it's not the largest issue at all and is definitely not gamebreaking. 




  This is the largest issue facing Dota right now

 These are gamebreaking problems that until fixed, make Dota unplayable for at least this user.

Lol.

 




  There is no way u can be making this post if ur higher than 3k.

 Technically it isn't. The Dire team has a +300 MMR advantage when you average them out. 
























 Ohio, USA. Grime all day. 




 It seems like most of the 50+ yard TD's were actually underthrown and really only caught because the WR beat the DB coverage pretty badly. 

I could be being overly critical, but if your WR has a 5 yard lead on the DB, you should be able to hit him in stride on a 40 yard throw as a starting NFL quarterback. 




 Blink. Mek on Tide really isn't that great because he has a pretty trash mana pool. 




 The servers haven't functioned well for the past year and a half.  




 Yeah the servers are trash. Just got an hour ban for not connecting even though I finished a 60 minute game 5 minutes before queuing with zero issues. But as long as you keep giving Valve money for hats, why should they care about the quality of their servers? You rant and rave all day about how much Valve doesn't care about the quality of the game and only the money from cosmetics as you spend $10 on a set for a hero you barely play.

Okay. 




  but I have never earned anything in my life.

Well, maybe you should give it all away, start from scratch and accomplish something difficult and time-consuming that you've always wanted to work for. Then at the end of it, you can look at whatever that might be, smile, and say "I did this."

If not, the aspirin thing isn't even going to work. It's actually really difficult to commit suicide by way of the aspirin/acetaminophen type of drugs. IF it even works, it'll take a good 6-10 hours of you experiencing severe liver failure and vomiting. It's not a quick process.

 In most of the United States the minimum age of consent for sex is 16. And in most of the ones that it is 17 or 18, there are stipulations that allow for "close in age" exceptions, that actually follow half your age + 7 pretty well.  




 I used to work at a casual restaurant for a bit right after high school, and a couple of my bros came in to chill at the bar before my shift ended.

This girl I knew who I shit you not could pass as a goddess came in to get some food. They know I was crushing on her pretty hard, and I got a bit nervous. When she came up to talk to me, after the hello's and whatnot I made the mother of all mistakes, especially with two of my friends right there.

*laughing about something* "So like, do you come here often?"

I just hear both of them burst out laughing for half a second and then try to conceal it, and the girl smiles as I'm trying to play it off and says she'd text me and left.

 If there is an audible change, the dj is using effects.

If there isn't, the dj is most likely setting up the song that will be mixed into the current one by getting it to the correct BPM, EQ'ing out frequencies, getting it to the part he needs to start the track at, etc. 

One thing to keep in mind is that, at least in my experiences, a dj can throw on his headphones and play both tracks, but make it so only one plays through the speakers. This allows lots of tweaking and button pressing to a track that isn't being played over the speakers to get it necessary to be mixed and transitioned into.

Or in the cases of shitty dj's, the mix is pre recorded but the dj is still required to do something to hype the crowd instead of just standing there. 




 Because you absolutely have no idea how it works when you're mixing.

 everything is pre recorded

Then he's a pretty terrible one that won't go anywhere with it.

 Listen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club. You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag, advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er... I dunno, "does what no other dildo can do until now", latest and greatest in sexual technology. Guaranteed results or money back, all that bollocks. These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the pleasure they are going to give the recipients. They send a cheque to the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, for twenty-five. You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them clear. Now this is the clever bit. Then you send back the cheques for twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they have sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques!

 In Monty Python Search for the Holy Grail, where Galahad goes into the castle full of women. I watched that movie maybe around age 11 and no idea what oral sex meant. At that time, I thought it was just talking about sex, and didn't know why it was so funny.

Watched it again when I was 18 or so, laughed my ass off. 




 The title is the only way I can describe the sound, just kind of like rushing air. I'm 21 and been able to do it for as long as I can remember, but I've never really been able to explain it to someone, and nobody else I've found has shared this "ability" I guess. The only way I've been able to explain it is that I guess I'm somehow flexing something in my inner ear, or increasing pressure somehow, and it generates the sound of whooshing air and people just look at me like I'm stupid. Also nobody else can hear it.

Thoughts?

 QoP is really easy man. 

Go mid, take 2 points in shadow strike and 1 in blink at 3, then 2 in scream. Get Null and Tangos, and use Q+auto attacks to harass the enemy mid. Unless they're full health you should be able to kill them with a full combo and some auto attacks at 6. There are only a few heroes that can actually take that kind of harass, and her high damage should make cs'ing easy enough. Gank a side lane if you get a good rune.

After the laning stage I like to rush Aghs. There is a lot of fighting in this patch, and having a 40 second cd 450 nuke at level 11 is massive, especially because that's before BKBs and you should be able to land your scream for another bunch of damage. 

After that I'd usually go Scythe or BKB depending on which I needed first, and then Octarine is sick on her as well. 

Remember: she may be squishy, but her auto attacks definitely do some decent damage.  




 It looks like it destroys the stopping mechanism too? I guess you'd have to buy a completely new saw. Which is still better than losing a finger though. 




 Yes sir. So all was not in ~~vein~~ vain. 




 I think it was a firecracker, maybe a M80. A couple of those in succession and being in a pretty ghetto part of town, I can understand it. 




 Well herpes isn't transmitted through blood, and that's the only fluid we shared. So I'm ruling it out. 




 A cold sore popped up on my lip today. Could be a coincidence or from one of the girls I hooked up with recently, but I'm not positive. 




 Most definitely. I'll forever have a wicked scar now to prove it. 




 Happened last night. So my best friend lives in Denmark, I live in the US. We are both hardcore drinkers, and he is back for a visit. We got all of our best friends together for a raging party at their house with lots of alcohol and some fireworks.

It's probably around 3 AM. After an uncountable number of beers and rum and cokes, we decide it would be a good idea to becoming blood brothers, to solidify the best friendship. We went about that by taking a knife, putting a small slit in our hands, and doing our handshake. Well, he goes to cut my hand and slices a ~~8~~ 3 or 4 inch gash into the side of my hand because alcohol. Uncontrollable bleeding, it's all over the floor, you get the picture. 

20 minutes later, 6 cop cars show up outside. Apparently they were called because a neighbor mistook the fireworks for gunshots. Well, they looked inside and saw the blood, and immediately busted into the house with guns drawn putting everyone in handcuffs.

We were eventually able to talk our way out of the situation and nobody got arrested, but for a minute it was looking like we were going to be taken to jail for attempted murder. They bring paramedics, I end up going to the hospital to get 8 stitches in my hand. Worth it?

**TL;DR: Got really drunk, shot off fireworks, tried to become blood brothers with my best friend, cut way too deep, I bled everywhere, cops mistook fireworks for gunfire, busted in and almost arrested us all for attempted murder because there was blood everywhere, ended up with 8 stitches in my hand.**

**Very late edit: I confused the size of the gash with the number of stitches when typing this, it's a 3 or 4 inch gash that required 8 stitches**

**Double edit: [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/T4z6KaE.jpg) a quick picture I snapped of it last night when I changed my gauze.**  




 Puck. When I was first learning, I never even attempted the hero because I could already tell I didn't have the skills to pull off his combos correctly.

One day decided I was going to make a smurf account when I considered myself more than adequately skilled and starting trying out Puck. I Instantly loved it. There's just something about being so slippery in team fights that gets me right (relevant Weaver flair). 




 It's just a flesh wound! 




 Uh, no. There's a difference between "you're small and weak, that's why you're vulnerable" and "this is how you protect yourself if someone makes an attempt to rob/rape you".

Everyone should know basic self defense techniques, regardless of size or gender. 




 I agree. The problem with this in schools is the zero tolerance violence policies. It's completely stupid. 

Look at it like this. If a kid confronts you in the bathroom and threatens to beat you up for your phone or lunch money, the school teaches you to lay down like a little bitch, let yourself get beat up and robbed and tell a teacher afterwards. Yeah, the kid might get punished later, but look at it in a real world situation. If you're being mugged, are you going to just let yourself get robbed for your wallet and then tell a police officer afterwards? That'll do nothing. It's far better to teach children how to defend themselves, so that later on in life they can protect themselves against potential robbers.

My dad taught me how to fight when I was growing up. I got robbed at gunpoint by someone smaller than me about a year ago. I broke his arm, kicked the gun away, beat the living hell out of him, and robbed him back. Got around $400 out of his pocket, so I'm assuming he'd been making rounds around the dark parts of my neighborhood all night. I guarantee that person will think twice about robbing people from now on. 




 Watch videos on youtube of very high mmr ES players and try to replicate what they do in bot games. I avoided ES like the plague until I saw I think a Jerax video of him playing it (could be wrong, it's been a bit) and decided to try it out because I was bored.

Took me 4 bot games to get the combinations down, went into ranked and won 2 games in a row at 3k. He's not super hard. Although this was before his 6.84 nerfs. 

 




 The only difference between ranked and unranked is that ranked shows your number and people generally try harder to win than just playing for fun. Your MMR will increase/decrease by around 25 for every win/loss. 

My advice in ranked? Only play heroes you are good at. Ranked isn't the place, usually, to experiment with new heroes or new builds. Having just reached level 13, I can guarantee you're not actually good at any heroes yet, but pick the ones you normally do best with. When you pick a hero you know in and out, you are able to focus more on map awareness, game situations, priority targets in teamfights, etc. That's how you improve.  




 Darqueze Dennard hardly played last year, but when he did I saw some great talent coming from him.

The only problem is the Bengals are still riding the dick of Terrance Oldman who can only reliably play the first half of a game, instead of letting Dennard get experience. 




 This isn't dubstep, and is also quite terrible. 




  People on the lawn can be seen playing cards, scrabble, doing crossword puzzles or **sometimes playing cornhole**.

This needs to be rephrased. 









  What we ~~we're~~ were

  people don't take us seriously as a contender because we can't beat the patriots.

I think it's more of the fact that you're in the easiest division in the league. The Texans are your only threat, but you're pretty much guaranteed a playoff spot every year.

If I'm correct, I think the Colts have been in the playoffs every year except 1 for the last 15 seasons. 




 And comparable to Dan Marino too I believe. 




 Go to skyline. Get a 5 way wrapped in a tortilla. Best thing ever. 




 NIP/NAVI take 1/2. 




 I'm sure you could go back into 6.83 and find an overwhelming amount of games where players made poor item decisions and played stupidly.

Stupid/bad players will always be stupid/bad regardless of what a patch did to the game. 




 FIRST 




 TIL Tobi, 2GD, Sunsfan and Sheever are all older than Draskyl. 




 Now if your team doesn't have any real disables and you're facing something like a storm or AM yeah the early orchid or hex is probably more viable. But if you've got good disablers holy hell it's a fun build. 




 What I've noticed is that since early pushing is somewhat back into the meta, especially with the rise of Undying, Leshrac and Death Prophet, you're going to be a ton more beneficial to your team by hitting that gigantic AoE ultimate every 40 seconds than say an Orchid or early Hex that focuses more on single target pick offs. 

You don't really need an Orchid if your E/R drops multiple heroes by 700 health (most likely over half of their health pool pre 20 minutes even on carries) in a half second, and the buildup of Aghs is easier than Hex. 




 If you haven't played QoP yet this patch, I'd definitely recommend trying her out. My build is Null/TangosBottleTreadsAghsBKB/Octarine (BKB if I need to fight now, Octarine if there isn't as much disable and I can get away with it, then into BKB)Shivas/Hex.

A 15-20 minute Aghs on her is retardedly strong, and Octarine means you lifesteal 25% per hero hit, so a 3-4 man Sonic heals you for close to 450-600 even through BKB on a 30 second CD. I think I've gone 8-2 on her in the past two days, would've been 9-1 if our fucking FV didn't super throw the last game I played. 




 This is one of the best shitposts I've seen in a while.  




 I'd get very comfortable with 3 heroes per role. That's 15 you could potentially choose from in a game. You can still spam single heroes, but like other people have said, if somebody picks it first or picks a hard counter then you're shit out of luck. Having a wider hero pool will allow you to still be able to play the game, and also making you an all around better player by being able to perform every role in any situation.

My go to heroes per role are PA, QoP, Centaur, Mirana, Dazzle. You don't really need to worry about which heroes are the strongest, just whichever you're best at, in my opinion. Back in 6.83 people said PA wasn't anything against a Troll, but since PA is the safe lane carry I'm best at, I still shit on most of them that I encountered. 




 I saw the little armadillo running around for the first time and had no clue what it was. I eventually clicked on their heroes to inspect and saw it was a cosmetic, and then got stunned and died.

Volvo plz 




 A tempo controller is a hero that wins 1v1 fights and can create a lot of pressure around the map. The examples I listed are all heroes that can easily punish an out of position support or core whenever they want. By doing that solo pickoff, you can then translate the 5v4 advantage into pushing a tower, winning a team fight, or taking Roshan. 

Basically, in higher MMR brackets a tempo controller being hidden off the map means the enemy team should be scared of where they are because they can be solo killed. In a MMR tier such as 750, I don't think the people even know what the mini map is, so you can use this to consistently roam around the map picking off their heroes, keeping the pressure up, and giving your team the advantage.

Tempo controllers are NOT heroes like Medusa or Spectre that require a lot of time and farm to come online and have less solo kill potential, or supports like Omniknight or Dazzle that are more geared towards 5v5 teamfights to be the most effective.

If you prefer support, Lion and Lina are great at this because their high amounts of magic burst is great for solo'ing heroes as well. 




 I'm actually considering trying out the new Solar Crest on him. The buildup is pretty easy and the evasion is good for when you aren't using the active. Maybe BKB into Skadi afterwards. 




 Happened to me a bit last game but only before 10 minutes. Fixed itself after that.  




 I personally prefer playing him as support. Lightning Storm is retardedly good in lane and any setup slow or stun is an easy kill. 




 I'm 3k and I haven't had any problems with Ursa or Undying. They've been in a few games but we've been able to handle them. 

Not looking forward to the return of Death Prophet. Fuck that hero.

I've been shitstomping with QoP so far this patch. AghsOctarineBKB is ridiculously strong. 




  and he's not a support that buys wards or couriers.

Well, in their defense, Leshrac is usually more viable as a core.  




 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo. 




 If I ever have to play support, I play one with high amounts of annoyance for the other team. Mirana and Disruptor are the two that come to mind first. Random arrows and TP glimpses help lighten the mood when your 4 hard carries are bitching about wards for 20 minutes. 




 If you can convince a support to help pressure the SF early it'll go better for you, but SF will have the advantage once he hits level five. 




  In the test patch,

Is that possible in the main client or did it get patched? 




 Synd and Tobi 




  iG .. if you put them T1 , you should look at their recent performance , re-evaluate 

Losing a few games doesn't drop you from T1 status. IG has been one of the dominant teams in Dota for years.  




 Leshrac, Zeus, Undying 




  people who get paid to calibrate accounts.

So the player can drop like a rock after they lose every game because they're truly a 2k player calibrated at 4k.  




 Maybe you're not aware of how TBD works? If you're a 4k player, you're not going to get someone who is 1K TBD in your game. Their hidden MMR is equal to yours, they're just in the calibration stage which means their game results are taken with a greater level of uncertainty.

For example, if you already calibrated and you destroy a game, you get +25 for a win. If they're TBD and they destroy a game, they might get +100 hidden for a win.  




 The Indianapolis Jones one kills me every time.  




 I got called a retard earlier for suggesting our 5th pick support should be something with lockdown for the enemy Storm Spirit rather than an Undying.

I hate people. 




 I feel like it will be best on initiators and tanky front liners. Similar to a Blade Mail, where they go in first and pop it, forcing the enemy team to either ignore them or have their spells reflected. This hesitation could buy your team the 2-3 seconds they need to get into position and take an early advantage in the team fight. 




 One downside is I'm feeling the return of the "DP insta pick ggpush" pub meta. 

I'm loving the changes to the comeback mechanic though. 




 Question.

I'm assuming the ultimate would still mean multiple UAMs could not stack?  




 Get you TO 3k. Not really any farther than that. 




 5 cs per minute on a consistent basis is enough to get you to 3k.  




  I usually play quite well but then my team just plays awful.

Mate, you're well below the average skill of a player for this game. You probably play just as poorly.

At that MMR, any hero can destroy if you're more skilled than your opponents. The issue isn't the hero you're picking, the issue is that you aren't better than them. 

The easiest way to win, regardless of hero, is to outfarm them. Focus on getting 5 cs per minute throughout the game on any carry, don't take stupid fights or make stupid decisions, and watch your MMR rise by a thousand.
 




 This is why I only try to play Dota overnight. Less children are online at 3 AM. 




  It's so annoying when an easy fight turns into a disaster because I accidentally disarm my carry. Valve please!

Try not sucking. It's not Valve's problem that you make mistakes. 




 You want a specific report for essentially not trying?

No thanks. 




 That would be insanely overpowered but I like the idea of the non-killable aspect. It techincally is a skill shot to hit because it isn't unit targetable, so making it last the entire duration barring a purge would make him much more viable in team fights as opposed to the almost purely single target damage hero he is now. 




  i'm not even sure if he's not slightly OP in competitive.

His biggest strength in competitive is the vision from his ultimate. He's still extremely easy to kill if you target him. He has great magic burst, but his entire arsenal is countered by a BKB. 

If you take away the mini stun, I feel like it's a nerf he doesn't actually need. 




 Lina, QoP, Axe, Io, Tiny is my guess. 




 Technically it reduces 1 armor per attack, which if maxed occurs every .95 (if that's correct) seconds. I guess that isn't terrible, considering it takes 4 hero attacks to kill it, which leaves you 5-6 of the bug on the target if they immediately start attacking it, resulting in a 5-7 armor reduction. 

I'd need some time to do the math, but since it doesn't scale, I'm pretty sure maxing Geminate does more damage over that time period than maxing Swarm. You'll get a geminate attack every 3 seconds if it's maxed. 

I think his biggest problem is stat gains.  




 He doesn't really need mana regen. If you're safe lane, you shouldn't need to W for last hits, plus the buff to E makes last hitting easier in general. If you do need to W often, tread switching beforehand should be fine.

Even if you did, the Aquila is more than enough to sustain you until you get your Skadi, which should come sub 20.

Also, at least in my opinion, you need the Skadi as soon as possible  because his STR/AGI gains are abysmal compared to other Agi carries. The maelstrom would just delay that further, yeah it's a nice farming tool, but again the problem is that your team needs to be ahead for that to work out. If you're behind, there's no way you could afford to get it because Weaver isn't even that great late game compared to other Agi carries. 




 Weaver is my favorite hero. But ever since 6.83 he's been shit to play. He can't flash farm, he can't rotate to jungle early unless you buy a MoM/HotD (something I actually haven't tried yet), he takes forever to come online, he is bad at base defense, his solo pick off potential isn't really much to write home about against anyone other than squishy supports and his late game isn't even that great. 

I was really hoping to see a strength gain increase in 6.84, but the only thing they did that benefited him was slightly buffing Geminate. His Aghs isn't good if you're playing him safelane carry, and The Swarm isn't worth more than a value point as opposed to stats, which he desperately needs because if you do manage to lock him down, he's still squishy as shit.

The build I ran in 6.83 and am continuing in 6.84 for safe lane is AquilaTreads then immediately rush a Skadi. After Skadi I go either BKB or Butterfly depending on the game situation. Rushing Linken's delays your damage items too much in this meta. Lotus Orb is kind of cool but only if you're against a team with multiple single target disables. 

It seems like the only way to play Weaver currently is to make sure the other 4 people on your team can secure you an advantage while you take forever to farm your items, because if you're losing, a Weaver definitely isn't the ideal carry to rely on to bring you back.

Thoughts? 




 Don't know the exact psychology, but carries are the ones that get all the big flashy items. Carries are the ones that see their names pop up on the screen for Triple Kills and Godlike Streaks. Carries, in most MMR tiers, are generally seen as "in charge" and the team leader. Carries usually do the most damage and control the game. 

Supports get commanded to buy wards all game and get reported for feeding when you go 2-10-25.

Which would you rather play?

 so what could be the reason so many people under 4k hate playing it?

Because people under 4k are stupid, think they're the best on their team automatically, and think that if the game isn't theirs to control, everyone else will shit the bed and lose. Then when they don't properly carry, they blame the supports.

TL;DR: People are stupid. 




 Speed 55, Decel 50, DPI is whatever the default is. 




 You're not supposed to cast Unrefined Fireblast at the start of the fight. The Unrefined Fireblast is only supposed to be used in an absolute "Oh shit I need a stun NOW" situation, or when you're at lower levels of mana because the cost drastically reduces based on your current mana.

Honestly, the Aghs isn't really worth it. Get a Eul's+Force Staff for a bit more cost and you'll usually have a much higher impact.

 since the Aghanims change.

What are you referring to? Unless I missed something, his Aghs upgrade has been untouched for a long time. 




  its a really hard game to get in to because of the learning curve.

It's a really hard game to get GOOD at because of the learning curve. I had zero MOBA experience when I started playing Dota 2, but I was hooked instantly. You need to accept the fact that you're going to suck for a while. If that turns you off, then Dota isn't for you. However, you're going to be in games because of matchmaking with players who are usually equally as terrible, so in theory it should balance out, and you'll have the occasional games where you do really well in comparison to the nine other players in the lobby. 




  i was playing life stealer

 i soloed a 4k health pudge in literally 1,5 sec

Lifestealer's Feast deals 7% of their current HP as damage at max level. At full health, that will do ~280 damage to a Pudge ON TOP OF your auto attack damage. ~260 on the next attack, ~240 on the attack after, etc. Pudge also has shit armor, and doesn't usually build items that grant him any additional armor, meaning physical attacks are barely mitigated. 

Lifestealer destroys heroes with high HP pools and low armor regardless of a Moon Shard. It's working as intended.
 




 The learning curve is extremely steep. If you have zero MOBA experience, it'll take you over a thousand game hours before you have anywhere near a grasp of what you're supposed to be doing in given situations, and another thousand before you're considered above average, assuming you keep improving over that time period.

My recommendation would be to read multiple beginner's guides when you're first starting to play. Play the "Limited Heroes" pool of heroes, as these are a grouping of heroes that are relatively low skill cap and friendlier for beginning players. Choose between three different heroes for every game. This allows you to learn a specific hero's skills and interactions easily, and allowing for more focus on in-game mechanics, map awareness and situational decisions rather than trying to focus on learning a new hero each game. 

You're going to be terrible for a long time. There's no denying it, and the only way to improve is to keep playing. Dota isn't a game you can pick up and be good within a week of playing it. Every "I probably shouldn't have done that" moment is a learning experience. You will make tons of mistakes. You will die tons of times. If this discourages you, Dota is not the game for you. There isn't some magical recipe to suddenly being godly. The only way to improve is to keep playing, keep reading guides, and keep learning the game.
 




 Ignore everyone saying you need to rush Linken's on Weaver. You don't. At all. 

What I've found to be the best build is Aquila, Treads, then rush a Skadi. Weaver can't flash farm and he desperately needs the stats early on if he plans to compete at all with the hyperfast farming carries (Troll, Jug, Sniper) of 6.83. I max W/E and take 1 in Q, skill the rest in stats and take ult 6/11/16. After Skadi go Butterfly if you feel like you can still farm effectively, or BKB beforehand if you need to enter fights. After that it's pretty much up to you. MKB/Daedalus would be my recommendation.

Also this is for safe lane Weaver and will probably carry over into 6.84 without much change, although a Lotus Orb could be pretty nice in there somewhere.

  If you're gonig to be harrased, always get a stout shield and consider PMS as an upgrade.

It depends on the type of harassment. If the harassment is coming from physical attacks, then yes stout/RoP/PMS is the way to go. However, if you're going to be taking mostly magical damage (from spells) it's better to forgo those items for extra regen instead. 




 I saw a video where he placed Stone behind enemy, pulled, kicked back, rolled in, ulted. It's how I was practicing in bot games to learn the hero. Tried it out in a 3k game and it worked a bit, unfortunately our Troll and Sniper were god awful and even though I got some solo kills and counter ganked pretty well we ended up losing pretty hard.

Is that combo good or bad? 




 Probably a couple weeks ago when I was solo'ing the second Rosh as Troll while the rest of my team was fighting 4v5 mid lane. I was so focused on getting to the fight as soon as possible to shift the fight in our favor as a Troll with two lives that as soon as Rosh died I Phase Boots'd my hardest to get there, ran in like Rambo and unleashed everything I had.

Unfortunately, it was at that point that I died. And died, as I realized after computing for a few seconds why I wasn't respawning with Aegis, without ever actually picking up the Aegis from Roshan's lifeless corpse.

Derp. 




 A pinch over 200,000 people on this subreddit.

Almost 11,000,000 unique players in the game this past month.

 I just learned how to play him too :( 




 Blink Dagger will now become more core than Force Staff on OD. I've mentioned this before, but this patch essentially solidifies it.

Think about it. Blink+Aghs. There's three heroes clumped up, blink right in, aghs ult them, imprison them, allow the rest of your team to get into position, and then wreck them. Perfect setup for a vacuum+wall, ravage, supernova, chronosphere, axe call, etc. 




  4x = 0 cooldown for long cooldown ultimates.

I don't think it would work like that. If you had a 100 second cooldown, the first Orb would take 25% of that away. Now you're at 75 seconds. I believe the next Orb would take 25% of the reduced cooldown away (25% off of 75 seconds, not 100) leaving you at 56.25 seconds. Another 2 orbs would leave you around 31 seconds cooldown. 




 Buff Weaver strength gain kthxbai
