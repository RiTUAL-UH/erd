 That's it. Cat fur denies all existing physics regarding volume. I'm sure the amount of fur my cat sheds in a month is enough to create whole another cat. 




 I'm a fridge.
I'm okay with this. 




 Pretty ok. My life isn't filled with excitement but I'm appreciated at work and earn enough. I don't have stats to confirm it, but it's probably along or more than the average.  Working abroad though so I miss home a lot.

The last time I heard from my hs friends, the so-called popular girls lived lives I wouldn't envy: gone into drug dealing, had crap jobs, etc. 




 I think you did a good job telling him off. I would have frozen up and just hung up on him. And a few minutes later come up with a long detailed fuck-you. Damn this escalator wit. 




 From what I've heard: "what's wrong with it? It dries anyway." Yeahhh well do you spit in your room then? Ugh. 




 English grammar broken down into formulae and students were asked to identify which formula it was. E.g. A boy runs home = No.1.

Then I moved to Canada and realized no one gives a damn about that kind of stuff. 




 I just watched it again a few minutes ago.

"Become vengeance, David. Become Wrath." 




 Intensity of positive emotions.

When I was looking forward to something I couldn't sleep the night before because I was so excited. When I was happy, I could really feel my heart pumping fast. It is no longer the case. Everything is "meh" to me. I still feel negative emotions to the fullest extent though.

I'm not sure if I can do anything about this. I'm always told to be grateful for what I have but it's very difficult to keep that in mind. 




 Catching the bus to work / home right on time without waiting for too long. 




 And how would that change affect your current life? 




 Wow he does an excellent job! Looks like an interesting movie... What are those horns doing there? 




 About 7 years ago I read from a psych textbook that Russian scientists managed to breed tame foxes. I wonder how that's going? I doubt foxes will become house pets anytime soon but looking at this cutiepie really makes me wish I could pet one! 




 "Hey. Heyyy... Come onnnnn...." XD He is adorable. 




 The last bit put a big smile on my face. Clonk is so endearing! Never thought I'd find a big green orc dude cute (aside from Shrek but he's an ogre) but damn. More please! 




 I chuckle at the thought of him holding in that position while someone took that picture. So cute. Keanu is one of those people who are hot and seem like a great guy to hang out with. Plus he can turn water into wine... Do you even miracle bro? 




 Damn cat. REVEAL YOUR ANTI-AGING SECRETS 




 I hope you allowed them to collect the droppings? It will be good to see the king give  *a crap*  when it comes to the freedom of religion.

I'll see myself out. 




 That is fucking brilliant. I don't use profanity in compliments usually but this is so impressive it must be emphasized with an expletive. I love the use of the colours! Being on mobile I had to look hard for Bender haha. 




 I can't separate Ramsay from wellingtons. Or poached scallops. "It's RAWWWW" 




 As I play the League I've grown to like champs that non-League players wouldn't find cute, like Cho and Kog. Now you made me find Vel'Koz cute. Well done. 




 "You've lured me with a false promise." 




 Oh that's why the gif was a bit gritty. I will look forward to seeing your cat in HD! (What's her name by the way?)

Here's my [Leon](http://imgur.com/5it7hIJ). He will be ten next January. I moved to Asia for work three years ago from Canada and he's stuck by me all these years :) 




 She's beautiful! I love that little bit of tabby stripes on her legs. My cat is a mix of siamese-turkish angora-tabby and he only has very feint stripes on his tail. Looks like your kitty had more blessing! :D Please share more photos when she comes home! 




 This has nothing to do with the racist trp dick in question but I can totally see Homer yelling the townspeople away and then being chased by a pitchfork wielding mob. 




 Is it possible you guys are blood related? Hair-coat colour match! 




 He sounds like a great guy to have around. 




 She could pass for a 2-3 year old. Cats don't seem to age after a certain point! I hope you two spend many hours cuddling up in warm blankets. 




 I would like to delude myself into thinking that Fox only wanted to keep her company until someone came around to help her. :p

I hope she goes to a wonderful home.3 




 Please Anivia. I'm so sick of looking at a frozen chicken when she's supposed to be a majestic cryopheonix 




 Thanks to Fantastic Mr. Fox the movie I think of Bill Murray whenever I see badgers. 




 How do they have that kind of perfectly assigned coat pattern of cute white mittens? I MUST KNOW 




 He can give me a full physical anytime. I think he's qualified.

Also I'd like to bang him. 




 In addition to Ferrous being a beautiful kitty, whoever wrote on that box has excellent handwriting. 




 A guy wearing a tight-fitted classic black suit with a white shirt loosening the collar. 




 Me just found Clonk. Clonk the best. Want more Clonk. 




 "You're carcinogenic."

Applicable to a wide range of situations and qualities. 

 




 There's a wiki article about the Canadian raising that could shed some light on this issue. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_raising

Personally, being a Canadian, I don't really see a whole lot of difference from English in the American midwest.  




 Wow. I mean MAYBE I could understand that this actually took place if the two were in the same place, but calling up the mom when she's at work? This guy is unbelievable. He does give dads a bad name :( I'm hoping he has some redeeming qualities but right now I can't think of one that could work in his favour. 




 So pretty. Jinx looks like she took a chill pill XD Kudos to your talented gf! 




 This reminds me of Baby Blues comics :( I don't know much about child rearing but what I gather from second-hand experience is that it takes a toll on mom especially. Hang in there! Hope you two get some real sleep soon. 




 As opposed to originating from Anglo Canadian provinces. -.- ugh 




 Not sure about the Anglo Canadians claiming poutine as their own but it was my understanding the vast majority of us enjoy the dish. Also isn't it pretty well-known that poutine originates from Quebec? Even the damn name is very French. 




 Look at that face. Just born and looks so zen and enlightened. 




 As someone who had hots for Dr. Grant I appreciate your story. Thanks so much for sharing it in such detail. 




 The shield looks beautiful! Can't wait. 




 I agree. Actually for someone who attends LSE her expressive power is pretty mediocre. 




 Thrillerrrr 




 Someone dipped his face into the ink jar! 




 I'm a big fan of the current Lee Sin portrait so the new update is a bit disappointing for me. The one we have now has a somber tone and his lips are not so thick... 




 Meanwhile I'm sad Zedd is not following the one true master race. Not too late Zedd, come over to the right side. 




 I love how he's standing above Fight Club. "You are not a... special... snowflake... AWW WHO'S A LITTLE CUTIE" 




 White socks3 




 Chris Crocker has been on /r/ladyboners before and we were debating whether his whole "leave Britney alone" thing was sincere or a parody. :p 




 The pro team champs look great! Female Luc looks bad ass too. 




 I'm patching right now and it's so good to hear the rework turned out great! I really like Viktor but I had some trouble dealing a lot of damage with him but it seems like that's the thing of the past now. The old ult was especially frustrating. It was like tickling champions ._. But not the case now it seems! 




 This is some dedication. Awesome job! 




 Didn't know this was coming out! So psyched now. I really want to get a new skin for Karma but frankly I don't like any of the current ones :( Except for the (new) classic. 




 Yeah I listened to it expecting it to be really sweet but then it turned funky. Wasn't prepared for that! 




 From this alone you don't sound like you were being clingy and what you expected was perfectly normal. But I suppose she wasn't looking for a serious relationship? She should've been more tactful in telling you so but I do agree that continuing seeing each other without clarifying het position would be just leading you on. She handled things the wrong way :(

Being a woman who doesn't enjoy casual encounters I don't understand her pov. 




 Watching him eat the burger makes me crave one instantly. 




 You didn't like that episode? I loved the beginning especially complete with the old Windows opening theme. 




 I hope you talk to (or already have) your doctor about it! Certain side effects are unavoidable but things like narcolepsy would basically make going on about a daily routine impossible. 




 Regardless of how much time you spent together breaking up via text messages is a pretty shitty thing to do. I'm sorry you had to go through with it. From what I read I don't know if you guys had any issues or what kind of person she is. So it's a bit difficult to come up with any perspective on that note :(

But know that we're here for you and ready to listen. Break ups suck even if you're the one who initiates them. There's really no way to make the pain subside fast.

I would encourage you to eat something if you can. Perhaps some fruit or cereal?

If you want to tell me more about the relationship or talk about anything else, let me know. 




 Wow I've been feeling the exact same way... It feels like I reached a plateau and am just stuck here... 




 I'm a bit late but Happy Birthday! 




 When will cats tell us the secret to anti-aging?! She's beautiful. 




 So cute that your camera got distracted out of focus? XD

But in all seriousness, thank you for providing a good home for this little cutiepie. I mean, you'll have to give up your ownership to all things that he(she?) likes, but that just comes with being a cat person, amirite? 




 I love the fact that you named your cats Lunchbox and Bento 3 




 Wow congrats! Though I have little knowledge of the condition I'm happy that you're healthier, not to mention looking better! keep it up dude :) 




 Now this wouldn't make sense in most worlds, but this is Skyrim where you can shoot down dragons by shouting at them. Sharpening swords with air isn't all that implausible. 




 Why does that springy thingy in her crotch bother me so much.. 




 ... you were saying? 




 "Hey, I got a busted ass and I see no one kissing it!"

"*exasperated sigh* alright I'm coming..." 




 I personally like S1-3 Zoidberg the best. His first appearance gets me every time. "My mother was a saint! GET OUT" 




 *squeal of joy* look at those pink jelly beans! She's so adorable. Have you named her yet?  




 Being the boring person I am, I'll just put it in my savings account. And then immediately find something to splurge on the very next month, totally invalidating the point of depositing it in the first place! 




 Exactly, one billion dollars. 




 I love how the background is also dark and snowing as if lamenting. So sorry for your loss. Stay strong. 




 Also taking SNRI here. And lost much of my sex drive too :( If your condition is more or less under control with the pills, could you consider decreasing the dosage, or switching to milder alternatives? I used to take citalopram (SSRI) before and that didn't seem to affect my sex drive.

In any case you should really talk to your physician about this if it's a major issue. I don't think many of us here are qualified to talk about the specifics of the meds. 

Good luck! 




 Graduated in 2011, so the memory is more or less fresh.

First off, don't think it's the end of the world and wait for the professor to respond. With any luck, and I find this to be true with most profs, he/she will give you another deadline but with some penalty. That's far better than receiving a zero right? Most profs don't enjoy giving out Fs and they will try to accommodate as long as the student shows the initiative. And I recommend that you disclose your situation (how depression is affecting your life). Some may think this is just laziness/carelessness. It wasn't the case. So unless you're very uncomfortable, telling him/her about your condition would definitely help. If the prof says no and you can't do anything about the essay, you can also ask if there are extra assignments you can hand in.

If all fails? Still, it's not the end of the world. You fucked up, but you can still recuperate. Maybe do better in the exam, or other courses? This may sound too callous, but it really is not the end. Don't worry yourself to death.

As for coping with depression itself: I'm one of the luckier ones that found meds that worked for me. I've talked to counselors a few times but I've found them to be very inefficient. They always told me what I already know. Meds kept me balanced and gave me at least minimum motivation to work on assignments and stuff.

I'm sorry to hear about your friend. I don't know the detail so I'm not sure how to comment on that. :( Talking smack about you to your boyfriend seems like a really shitty thing to do...

But for now your essay situation seems to be the more dire problem, so I hope you get that in order before tackling the friend issue. 

Anyhoo, I hope my comment can give you at least a little bit of courage. Again, it's an obstacle you can handle! PM me if you want to vent. :) 




 I don't know much about art but I really like the colours you used. Especially green. It's something that you wouldn't expect to see in a portrait but it reveals the mood perfectly. Well done. 




 Just reading his comment history makes me sad. I would be angry, but it's too depressing to make me angry. I see he's also posted on white supremacy subreddits. Sigh. Sometimes I fantasize about rounding up all the racist people on earth and putting them in an isolated island... 




 I hope months turn into years. Congrats :) 




 "Dude... I like... totally forget I was doing" 




 Wait... colours in Skyrim? Burn the heretic!! 









 I can't find the link right now and the reverse image search on both Google and Karma Decay shows that it's gone, but there was a photo of a woman wearing an engagement ring in the comment section of another photo. The ring seemed a bit tight for her and everyone was blatantly making a crack at that, or saying how it looked cheap. Someone said something along the line of: "who says you can't buy an engagement ring where you can buy tires?"

Today I logged onto facebook and discovered my friend got engaged on her birthday. I was so psyched. I made an international call to her (I'm working overseas), congratulated her, and we were both so happy. I've known her for a long time and she's such a sweetheart.

I got off the phone and scrolled further down her profile only to see the exact same photo that was ridiculed on Reddit.

That's when I did the reverse image search. It seems like there's no trace of it now for some reason.

I'm very sure it's the exact same photo because it popped up recently and the angle / the shape of the ring -- everything really matches up. 

I really didn't want to upset my friend when she was so happy but I told her about it just so she would increase the privacy setting on her FB and go through the friends list to get rid of people who might do this.

Whoever posted that link in the comment was a friend of my friend. I guess that's what's pissing me off, not so much that it happened on Reddit. I have a vague idea who might have done this based on what my friend told me before but I have no proof. And the link is gone now, for the better or worse.

Sigh. 




 I moved to Asia for work and my cat (9 y/o) is trapped inside a highrise apartment with very little to observe outside. It's been like this for about three years now and I feel so bad. 

He shows little interest when I try to play with him using the "traditional" cat toys. I know he's really bored and would like to bring in another cat, but that's not in the cards right now.

I also tried bringing him outside in a stroller (all sides closed but he can still look outside) but he was very stressed out and would yeowl until I brought him home. Mind you I did this in a residential area with no traffic or loud noises. There were some kids playing about but I always kept them at a safe distance where he wouldn't be subjected to any unwanted attention.

Could someone suggest ways to entertain him? Even though his appetite and weight haven't changed I'm afraid he's depressed. 














 (Or for that matter, any other "deem/consider/perceive" type of verbs)

e.g. "He deemed the policy unfair." vs. "He deemed the policy to be unfair."

I always thought these were interchangeable but perhaps they are not? How are they different exactly? 









 The variation of the main theme + really unsettling, even barbaric tunes when the Wildlings are butchering the Brothers. Every aspect of the episode was superb but I was especially immersed in the music. It almost reminded me of that used back in the Charlton Heston era. Very epic, traditional, and hits right in the nostalgia. Music definitely gave the mammoths and giants the more threatening atmosphere. 









 I've been using Firefox for nearly five years now and all was well and suddenly it reports a certification issue with gmail/google. When I google something I have to add an exception for EVERY SINGLE KEYWORD I type in. For Gmail it doesn't even give me an option to rule it out as an exception.

At first I thought this was Firefox-specific so I tried it again with IE but it has the same issue. I've been checking my mail via phone :( I guess I can make do with it but I don't understand why it's suddenly acting up this way.

Has anyone else had a similar problem? 




 I used to like the Watch Later function. I would add a bunch of videos, sort them to my liking, and add them to a neat little list. It would also show which one I watched so when I went back I could either restart or move onto the next one. 

Now it only has a "remove watched video" function and the ability to leave notes (which makes me wonder just how many people actually use this).

Switching to Google+ is one thing. Now the comment section works fine, it doesn't share everything I write to Google Circle automatically, so I can begrudgingly accept the change.

Why tamper with what already worked fine?

Please, if I'm missing something here and complaining about this because I don't know better, someone let me know. I'd rather admit that I'm an idiot than continue on with this nonsense. 




 I considered posting here when I was feeling particularly low but I always think that there's someone worse off than me and I should buck up. (But I never use this logic on someone else as I hate hearing it from others myself.) Instead I've decided to post some of the things I do when I feel really down in spite of meds. Perhaps it will be of some help to some.

- Watching the Simpsons and Futurama

I find Matt Groening's work incredibly therapeutic. I also watch South Park and Family Guy too but the Simpsons and Futurama have a warm edge that its contemporaries don't really seem to have. Futurama is especially endearing. I watch episodes nonstop and just lose myself in the story and characters. They make jokes that might be considered dumb/outdated by today's standard but that makes it so nostalgic and cozy.

- Reorganizing and cleaning out the desk / closet

Sometimes my mind is off-limits. I can't deal with it. But the physical act of cleaning my room gives me a sensation similar to reorganizing my thoughts. A neater, well-organized room is just a byproduct. I fold my clothes, do laundry, do the vacuum cleaning, etc. I play music I love loudly and focus intensely on cleaning and that only. It's like workout except I'm enjoying it. I wish I loved exercise but I really, really hate it. So much. I could never relate to people's advice on working out for expelling thoughts that get me down. Cleaning is a good substitute I think.



Perhaps hackneyed and worn out ideas, but I thought these may help and that I should just write these down to remind myself again. I'm at work and I can do neither right now. I feel trapped and am forcing myself to smile. I'm on the verge of just giving up but I have to move on. I don't know why I feel this way. I just am. 




 Context: I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was in high school (i.e. 7+ years ago). I was on cytalopram for a while but it didn't do much for me. Luckily about three years ago I found medications that worked for me. The current pills I'm taking are SNRIs, the primary agent being venlafaxine.

Last Monday I was supposed to go see my psychiatrist but I was making an important call during my lunch break and I forgot. I thought to myself: what harm could it do? I had some leftovers from previous appointments and I would only miss a day's worth. How callous I was.

So this is how I felt: sensory overload in every turn.

Every sound delved into my head like a jackhammer. I put on earphones without listening to anything but it didn't do anything. My coworker's keyboard typing which I would normally ignore was so painful that I had to leave the room for a while. Secretaries walking fast-paced here and there hit me like a gong. It resonated within me. They irritated me and numbed me to the core at the same time. I wanted to attack someone.

I turned to work to maintain focus. I work as a translator at a law firm. I usually work on court decisions, briefs, complaints, etc. I'm always fascinated by the stories I read. It lessens the inevitable boredom destined to come with the line of my profession. I picture them in my head and it helps me visualize. Concentrate.

I was assigned to translate a complaint a few days ago so I was working on it. I tried to calm myself as I tried to regain control over my senses and just work. It was okay for a while until I hit the word SUICIDE. A former rep director of a company being sued had committed suicide.

Normally I would just look upon it with some dismay and move on. It's really unfortunate but what can I do?

In this instance I couldn't just move on. My eyes were fixed on the word. I felt like I was about to throw up. I didn't know the person. And yet the word stabbed me and I was left in shock. I wanted to cry.

That was when I decided I couldn't stay in the office. I had taken the meds at that point but it wasn't working fast enough. I had to go home.

I feel better now. I can withstand my surroundings once more. The words don't send me into shock like before.


I thought I'd share this with you while the memory and the sensations are still fresh. My mom always tells me to "will the depression away". I'm not just having a bad day. I can't function without these pills. Call me a weak-willed person if you want. That doesn't change the fact that I'd just crawl into a corner and do nothing without meds. 









 I've seen action figures and plush toys, but these are pretty common throughout any series. 

What kind of novelty items would you like to see for Futurama specifically? (e.g. an F shirt with a fake mutant arm attached?)

I've seen on Reddit someone knitted a Zoidberg mask for their kid for Halloween and would love to own one myself it was for sale.

Other random things: "Nixon 30xx" bumper stickers, Slurm (sans the secret ingredient), Bender's purple camera, a digital photo frame shaped like the What-If machine, Gemerald ring candy 









 I've been seeing him for the last two and a half years now.

I come from a culture where going to university is a norm. If you failed to get post-secondary education, you're deemed as a failure.

I spent the majority of my life in North America and on papers and in my heart I consider myself as a westerner, though I don't look it. I moved to the country I was born in to get a job and I'm living with my parents. I insisted on moving out but they wouldn't let me. They went so far as to say that they would disown me if I did. But I digress...

I'm turning 26 this August and due to the said culture I'm considered a marrying age. But I don't think I'll get married any time soon if ever. If I were back home I might have moved in with this guy but here cohabitation is frowned upon. Big time.

I've been lying to my parents in regards to my relationship with him. I said we broke up and are now just friends. Maybe it's because they suspect something but they still don't like the fact that I stay in touch with him.

It's not like my boyfriend is a socially unacceptable human being. I admit there were some times when I wished he'd studied more, but I've come to accept that I can't rely on romantic relationships to satisfy my intellectual needs. We have fun together and most importantly, when we argue about something and he's at fault, he admits it, apologizes, and tends not to repeat the same mistake. His open mindedness is what won me over in the first place. I come from a drastically different background and he was very accepting.

On the CV he appears to have all things that are considered to be "red flags" in the Asian cultures: had an abusive father, his parents are divorced, he didn't attend university, etc.

I'm having an increasingly difficult time letting my parents see the fact that I'm not looking to get married and I'm just in a stable relationship. And even if I DO end up marrying him, would that be the end of the world? So what if I'm enrolled in a graduate school program and working at the same time, making twice as much as his annual salary? Does that somehow make me a better person? We're compatible and have fun. Our attitudes on important issues are similar. When we have an argument it's a clean fight without emotional scars. Isn't that the most important thing in a relationship?

I feel so cornered. I feel so pressured to break up with him because I don't know how to handle my parents. I don't know whether I want to marry him so I don't even know if I should take a stronger stance on this and force them to accept things as they are. 




 Hi Reddit,

very first post here. I'm in a bit of trouble with my newly purchased BB gun and I was wondering if any of you can help me out.

I just bought a Walther P99Q with metal pellets and I'm moving to South Korea (Seoul) soon. I'm sending most of my bulky stuff via sea, and I thought this would be okay. From my research it seems like it's a definite no-no on flight, be it a check-in or carry-on, but no one has given me an answer about shipping it through, well, a ship. (I know I should've checked this first, but my desire trumped reason... ugh.) 
If it comes to the worst, I guess I'll have to sell it to an acquaintance before I leave. (The store takes no refund. Again, very stupid of me.)

I'm sending it from Vancouver, Canada, to Seoul, ROK. Anyone who knows anything about the customs/security, I'd really appreciate your advice.

*Wow I just mispelled internationally and can't edit the title. Damn. 
























 Any photo of her? 

Looks like she's under good care. She'll grow up into a supreme overlord of your house in no time! :D 




 I love the way you phrased that. Thanks for bringing her to safety. 




 This looks like an aquarium ad! Awesome shot.

Also way to get his nonchalant side. Very photogenic. 




 I was hoping he would suggest ways to get him to stop but he was like "meh, if it makes him happy why not let him?"

Btw 10 weeks! Must be so tiny and cute. She may grow out of the habit though since she's just a babe. I hope for your sake she does. The claws have left may scars around my ankles. 




 Oh is that what it's called? XD That's really cute. I should get my cat a mini rolling pin plushy. 




 I won't lie and say I know what that feels like. I lost my grandpa to lung caner a year ago but I imagine hearing this kind of thing about my parent would be something quite different.

If you can't talk to your friends, feel free to talk to us in detail. Or if you're in school, your school counselor perhaps? Online help goes only so far and it'd be nice to have someone listen to you in person.

I'm not sure what kind of words, if any, could bring you solace. But know there is someone who's willing to listen. 




 While it's not for everyone meds changed  my life. I no longer feel suicidal or cry for no reason. I hope it works out for you! 




 I'm glad you're still with us. 




 My (almost) 10 year old cat still does this. He sucks on his arm so it turned that part of his fur brownish colour (he's greyish white overall with lilac points). I was concerned about possible skin conditions but the vet said there was nothing wrong with it. :s

But damn. 10 years! I don't know why he keeps doing it. 




 Nicely done! If you distress the leather it'll look even nicer. Love the eye makeup. I always thought Drogo looked ultra fabulous with the smokey eyes XD  




 Look at that magnanimous smile. Methinks s/he must speak with an elegant Oxford accent. 




 This deserves to be a race. Could you imagine going into a random cave and running into a horde of creatures with faces like this. Bone chilling. 




 I love the mod versions too but I think I'm gonna stick to vanilla until I get sick of it. Skyrim is beautiful on its own. 




 Oh I thought it was Tommen... But is it a whole lot different from a kid dressing up as Danny or Jon? Aren't we assuming that this is insulting because Peter Dinklage happens to suffer from dwarfism? 




 I'm not sure why you're under the fire so much for saying this. I too feel this way. I'm sorry OP has to deal with this mess but at the same time my heart goes out to the poor woman who chose to end her own life. So yeah I totally get where you're coming from. 




 "I have no idea why those walking snacks built this but it sure is handy! *awww yeah. That hits the spot.*" 




 I love her coat! Gold and black. Very houte. 




 She's adorable. Love the one where she's sitting next to you. 




 The costume looks beautiful. My favourite part is the hair. Hands down. Well done! 




 I love this kind of feeling. Why do you think it's a bad idea though? 




 The cat looks pretty challenging. I myself have no carving skill so any attempt to replicate something like this would result in pumpkin slaughter. 




 Man that game kind of frustrated me with donuts (I forget the currency name... those in-game purchases) so I quit early. Wish I had seen this before I quit! 




 Seriously it's not fair... If you have nice eyes, you should at least have some kind of deficiency elsewhere. Goddamn full lips, six pac bod, beard... THIS GUY IS CHEATING alert the mod. 




 Dammit now that's all I can think about. :( 




 Hugs. I love her coat pattern and white socks. I'm sure you and your mom made a loving home for her. Hopefully she'll be having a lot of fun with other kitties in heaven until you guys get to see her again. 




 I don't know who you are, I don't know what you want... But if I find you, I'm going to give you a big hug and buy you a beer because you're an awesome person. Your son is lucky to have you. 




 That's some dedication. Looks great! Are you gonna do the rest of the house sigils? 




 Now here I was expecting an NSFW photo of Lydia. Shame on me... 




 Man it looks almost like someone put a picture of him in the artsy photoshop filter. It looks awesome. Great job! 




 Your mom is really talented! I know brain slugs are parasitic aliens but damn they're cute. 




 I can appreciate people having different tastes in fashion but your bf sounds like he needs to back off a bit. I really like your inspiration photos! It wasn't anything to be embarrassed about. If he means a lot to you I hope you have a good conversation with him and tell him how he makes you feel. I mean, I'm not a big fan of how my bf dresses but I limit myselt to recommendations. 




 I'm sorry it happened to you. Putting that scumbag behind bars probably won't make things entirely better but I'm glad you're on your way to healing. Many hugs. 




 Any plan to colour it? It looks great! 




 Gnar has the cutest walk.♥ 




 Congratulations!! 




 I'm sorry you lost them. I lost my grandpa last year to lung cancer. I was 25 at that time too.

I doubt there's the right way to grieve. Cry if you want to. Occupy your mind if you think you're falling too deeply into your emotions. 




 I'm apparently old enough to take up burdens of an adult but too young to enjoy privileges that such burdens entail.

I'm 26. Come the fuck on. 




 That'd be awesome. Also, being able to make friends with people as long as I talk to them long enough. 









 I'm sorry to hear that. :( I thought working for a big IT corporation would be exciting but I suppose like all things in life it looks glamorous only from the outside. But I bet knowledge in engineering opens up lots of possibilities. I hope you find your passion one day. Preferably soon. 




 Aside from my room, IKEA. Maybe it's that nesting syndrome mentioned in Fight Club but fuck it, I love it there. (I also loved playing the Sims... This probably has something to do with that to.) The country I'm currently living in doesn't have an IKEA and it's killing me. 




 I wish I told my grandpa how much he means to me and how grateful I am that he was my grandpa before he slipped into a coma and died (cancer). He was one of the few that believed in me no matter what. 




 Robin Williams so I can watch his old movies again. I can't watch them anymore because looking at him makes me miss him so much.

I lost my grandpa (to whom I was very close) to cancer but given the circumstances my aunts are in I'm not sure his being alive would benefit him a lot. He would be stressed out. Probably get cancer again. 




 Happy Birthday. 

While I'm not a man I too feel really down on my birthday. It's like I'm getting older while getting none the wiser.

I wish I studied harder in my university so I could've gotten into law school. That way I could've stayed in my home country. Would've helped me retain my self-confidence too. 




 I've actually been writing a thriller for quite some time. I used to write like crazy in my university years, whenever inspiration hit me, but now this job has drained my creativity.

What about you? Any career you'd like to pursue? 




 I actually thought the premise of Resident Evil was pretty good (not the movie; the original game series). A pharmaceutical company wants to create a monster biologically engineered for wars but the success rate of the virus turning a human into a super soldier is pretty low and turns the failures into zombies. Maybe they won't have the hunger for human flesh, though. Hmm... 




 I still listen to AQUA. Barbie Girl, Dr. Jones, My Oh My. They're just really cheerful and fun to listen to. 




 Exactly! I'm studying law and frankly I'm a bit sick of it. I wish I had the balls (though I don't have any physical ones to begin with) pursue my dream of being a professional novelist. "Write on the side" they said, "you can always publish a book while working a different job" they said... 




 This post was tagged serious. Grow up. 




 Call me naive and idealistic, but I don't want Canada to change like the US did after 9/11. Proper precautions are necessary, but taking drastic measures seems like saying terrorists can indeed affect us with violent coercion. 




 I posted the link in one of my comments below.

I think some people misunderstood my comment/link as a cry for attention. I just wanted to show OP my cat. :s 




 I work at a law firm during the day and attend grad school classes at night. I have no idea what I want to do with the degree. I was hoping I would know by now. 




 Thanks. It's actually a he :D 




 Well I didn't post the link because I wanted attention but people seem to think I did. OP has a really pretty cat and I wanted to share a photo of my cat with him/her. I'm a little shocked my good intentions were taken so wrong.

As for the link, [here it is](http://imgur.com/5it7hIJ). 




 I try not to do so since that annoyed the shit out of me. 




 She is beautiful! It kind of hurts my ego because I'd like to think my cat is the most handsome cat in the whole wide world...

Edit: Wow so much hostility for just posting a link to a picture of my cat. Link removed.

Edit2: The link is back up in one of my comments below. Again I'd like to clarify I didn't want to steal attention away from OP or want people to affirm my (jokingly said) statement about my cat being the most beautiful. 




 Or something like "ovulation setting" which can be turned on and off so you can be in complete control of your pregnancy. 




 Gamer (with Gerard Butler).

I really loved the premise but the ending was total bullshit. I feel like the showdown in the end was so hackneyed and implausible. Why would a CEO risk fighting someone who's proven his physical strength in countless battles? Also what's the point of manipulating someone's mind if the person could just overcome it with the force of will? Also the part about the brothers (I forget the exact name; underground rebels against Michael C. Hall) was pretty lame.

You can't bring down the entire system by just killing off the head guy. You have to slowly affect the system and convince users to drop it. Not sure if a 2-hour movie can show all that, but that would have been the better ending. 




 Since a lot of people have already said philanthropic stuff, I'll say something very trivial but satisfying: winning a very dragged out League game through teamwork. Wish I could meet my team members in real life and give them a highfive. 




 Some people hate saying "this restores my faith in humanity" but fuck that, it really does make me believe in mankind more. 




 "Bender we love you"

"Shut up baby, I know it"

Futurama seemed like it really wanted to make "I'm back baby" popular but I've always liked this one better. 




 You set us up! I was preparing for the worst for a sec. But I forgive you because you have a cute dog and I too love RDJ. 




 Haha I wouldnt go as far as calling them assholes. they just don't know much about the condition. But yes I agree the family environment doesn't necessarily help me in this regard. 




 I didn't mean ONE absolute purpose. Until recently I wanted to go down a certain career path but that is no longer the case. I used to live with a drive. Now that's gone I feel empty. 




 The importance of LGBT rights.

I'm currently working abroad in Asia. I was born in this country but emigrated when I was a teen and earned Canadian citizenship. 

It's mind-boggling how LGBT rights are pretty much nonexistent here and people have no idea how offensive they can be when they talk about the LGBT community in a certain way. I've actually had pretty heated arguments with my family members living here over this subject and got into a fight almost. I myself am straight, but I have gay friends back home and my blood boils up whenever people preach all sorts of nonsense. e.g. all gay men will act on their attraction to anyone and will try to rape straight guys. SERIOUSLY?!

 




 Haven't played it in a while but whenever I play Diablo II I appreciate its structure and style every single time. Too bad the successor didn't live up to my expectations... 




 A purpose in life. I feel like all I do is existing. The bare minimum

Edit: thanks for great advice guys. Appreciate it. I'm not looking for a grand ultimate purpose. I'm reevaluating my career choice and the goal I was pursuing for like a decade just disappeared. So yeah that's why I said I wanted a purpose in life. 




 That's pretty exciting though. 

I'm also doing a Master's degree (in law). Working during the day and studying in the evening have worn me out actually. 




 I'm sorry about your ex's baby. It's too bad you guys broke up. Best of luck to you in the Marines. 




 Depression (*May differ from person to person): I can't will/pray/force the condition away. I need meds to function properly. For some people counseling does wonders and they seem to have been cured of depression but it's not for everyone and for some, like me, depression is a lifelong condition with no cure. I make do with meds and they've kept me on the level well enough so I can work and enjoy life to an okay degree. I'd be a train wreck without them.

Actually my family has been the worst to me, not friends or people who know me less. 




 I think I like law more as an academic subject. I just don't think I'll enjoy working 12 hours a day, barely getting any sleep, stressed beyond imagination, to get a brief done, etc. It seems like work never ends for lawyers. Some people are cut out for this kind of challenge but I'm finding out I'm not quite that sort of person. 




 Thought I would be a lawyer by now (age 26) or on my way to be one. I do work with law but am not a lawyer, nor am I sure if I want to be one anymore. It's not the end of my life but I do feel hollow after losing a goal I was following for more than 10 years. I don't know what to do with life and feel like I should've felt this way back in high school. 




 Already did. She kicked ass. 




 Now that I think about it that's true lol. I think I got sad because I was thinking of my own grandma. 




 I don't know you but I'm proud of you and happy for you. Congrats!! 




 Yeah I think Uma Thurman was a great choice for Poison Ivy. Her lines were the main problem. "Curses!" 




 I love his meltdown in that review so much. 




 Is it the one where the initially grumpy grandma sacrifies hereself to save the family? I watched the movie as a kid and that scene made me so sad.

Also the teenager couple all bloated in the searing hot springs traumatized me. 




 I'm sorry you can't act on how you really feel. Even though I wish you could date someone you find sexually attractive, I think you're wonderful for valuing the life you have. You have my respect and admiration. 




 [Oasis - Part of the queue](http://youtu.be/zq0DldWTXdA)

"I fall down, heaven won't help me; I call out, no one would hear. ... Every beginning is breaking its promise, I'm having trouble just finding my soul in this town" 




 Same here. I hope it has wifi though. 




 Even though that part was necessary to create tension among the women later on I hated it as well. It felt so dragged out. 




 I don't find tbbt funny but I feel like it's because I'm not smart enough to understand the jokes. My nuclear physicist friend loves that show... 




 The obligatory GoT reference: pillage me, the Great Stallion. 




 Congrats! I love that mom is holding her kitties close to her in the first pic. So much love. 




 That's surprising and good to hear. My siamese x turkish angora x tabby sheds so much fur even though his hair isn't that long. Perhaps the shedding is inversely proportionate to the length? Haha

Anyhoo your fluffy kitty is lovely♥

 The funny thing is that it was one of the top posts that day. :s Only his comments within were downvoted. 




 I have no idea why I'm doing the master's program and it's costing me five grand a term. I feel like I'm sticking to just so that I can add another line to my resume -- which I despise. Working during the day and studying at night exhaust me. 




 Edit: saw the context below. Unfortunately you were wrong. 




 There was a guy who posted a photo of his cosplay on the Futurama subreddit. His comments in the thread were downvoted because his hair didn't look like Fry's. Granted it didn't bear much resemblance, but he had at least put effort into putting the costume together. He wasn't toxic to haters either. I didn't understand at all why he was downvoted.

 You are an awesome dad/mom. Just wanted you to know. 




 10/10 aftercare customer service 




 Choosing to take beginner to intermediate econ courses in university.

I had planned on majoring it (convinced by my dad) so I took the pre-req's. I'm glad I learned the basics of economics but I performed poorly and ended up majoring in something else. My overall GPA suffered a lot. 




 "What's it like to live in Canada?"

I'm working abroad and I miss home every single day.I love being asked about it. 




 Did you really take away all happiness from my life because I asked for straight A's in my last year of high school in exchange of it?

I mean I made the offer so I guess I shouldn't complain, but that's really been the case for the last 7 years. I'm really curious. 




 Now you know what I've been going through. 




 I'm a lapsed Catholic and I'm sympathetic to both religious/atheistic sides. One of the things that Reddit does and makes me sad is extreme hatred to anyone who believes in the existence of a God. Sure if that person is forcing others to follow his belief that should be pointed out but if faith helps that person be better, live a good life, treat others well, etc. why not just embrace the fact that a religion can do some good? :s 




 My god I'm so happy it turned out great! I was holding my breath as I read your post. What I came to understand from my univ experience is that most profs really want to see you do well and if something is out of character they do catch on. I hope you get that A you deserve! :D 




 I've despised Justin Timberlake for years because he makes so many girls swoon and has that playful, cocky as fuck attitude but actually I lust after him in secret. DON'T TELL ANYONE INTERNET 




 The point is that they think it's okay because it "dries" = no harm done. It's a ridiculous argument. 




 Coca cola itself is probably not gonna happen because it's blatant advertisement, but I do want Voli to have some sort of drink in his hand as he chases after champs! That would be majestic. 
























 Probably not as devastating or terrible as some... but I found out my mom regrets marrying my dad whereas my dad does not. He's not a terrible person per se; just very stubborn.

I knew their marriage wasn't perfect but to hear her actually say that was a bit disheartening. 




 Very lucky. As much as there's a lot of shit going on in my life, I've been incredibly lucky that my hard work paid off when it needed to. 




 Yeah I don't understand either. I thought this was a cute post. And a lot of people clearly agreed since it got to the front page.

Edit: You don't like this because of FB qualities. Point taken. 




 What a pretty pattern. Man that fish is a better artist than I! 




 From the thumbnail alone I saw the inside of the ears as red eyes and the face as an open mouth. I was so confused why this was on awwducational 




 "I'm not a racist but it's time for dinner"

 Put that cookie down! 




 "Very poor choice of words." 




 I admire you for being the bigger person. I think I'd be consumed with rage and bitterness if someone did that to me. Hope you find a great guy that deserves you! 




 "lol sry bro, got so many prompts and must have clicked yes by mistake." 




 I'm sorry you had to go through that kind of shit. Just reading your comment broke my heart; I can't even imagine how difficult it must have been for you. But looks like you have great kids. Best of luck to you. 




 Being dismissive of people who hold jobs that pay less.

I went on a blind date with a guy who was really full of himself. He was also a hard worker so I could kind of see why he was so proud of his achievements, and I tried to be understanding. But then he said something like "you know how bus drivers are, they're uneducated and grumpy." That drew the line for me. Didn't even want to be just friends with the guy afterwards. 




 I really wanted to finish Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth but I was too much of a wuss. Survived the Attack of Fishmen chapter, didn't have the energy to continue. I think I would've had more fun if I had my friends over to play it with me. 




 Same here. That Let it Go song made me sick of the movie even before I watched it. 




 What defines "nice"? This is probably an extreme example but I'm sure Hitler was a pretty nice person to people who blindly followed him. 

IIRC Louis mentioned that implying that they weren't nut jobs when they were going on about their daily routine. They did have a "normal" side to them, loving their family and enjoying little things in life, but it pales next to what they believe and how they act on such beliefs. 

My heart goes out to former WBC members, but I find it hard to believe those who stay there and choose to spread hate can be deemed "nice". 




 It's pretty amazing how most people in the ROK are skinny to slim when they offer fattening food like this. I have the Korean genes but I wasn't born with that kind of "eat whatever the hell I want but stay skinny". 




 I think the sight of something can make someone feel "neugul" / nauseous. I agree food itself should be described as "neuki" / greasy. 




 Paper fresh out of a photocopier, all warm.

It's kind of disconcerting when it's in tens or hundreds of pages and I have to work on it, but it still has a peculiar smell I find pleasing. 




 How *you* doing? (a la Joey) 




 I like the faction idea, but yeah I wouldn't buy monthly subscriptions either. It'll probably make me feel like I *have* to play the game as much as possible as opposed to just making me want to play whenever. That's too bad. 




 "love don't make things nice - it ruins everything. It breaks your heart. It makes things a mess. We aren't here to make things perfect. The snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. Not us! We are here to ruin ourselves and to break our hearts and love the wrong people and die. The storybooks are bullshit." - from Moonstruck.

Not particularly cute but something about this resonated with me. Love makes us unreasonable, at times insane, and the lines seem to capture that perfectly. 




 One time back in university years I thought this server at my fave restaurant was pretty cute. I left him my number in a post-it with my check. Never heard back from him so I stopped going there for several months out of embarrassment. 




 Oh yeah, watching it would be fun. I'm not particularly good at PvP so :p

I guess Skyrim Online doesn't have this? I haven't tried it out. 




 I would love this as well except I'm not sure how it could be a competition. PvP? Things would come down to the issue of who has better items and not skills. 




 Actually it doesn't exactly apply to other people who hold the same position as I do. I was extremely lucky.

I'm isolated from the rest of my colleagues (who work together in one room with cubicles, where I once worked as well) and even though technically I could, I would feel too self-conscious to do whatever I want. Right now I share my office with one colleague who is not my supervisor so anything goes. I receive assignments via email or phone calls so people giving me work rarely see me in person. 




 Yup, shit vs. the shit doesn't make much sense to me either. 




 I don't know how that phrase was coined but I always imagined a giant cookie merrily rolling on the road... 




 I can pretty much do anything I want at the office as long as I get my job done in time. I've watched movies, played the League, blogged, taken a nap, etc. 




 I absolutely love that series. I really have to commend him for tolerating them and trying out their way of life even though he (like the rest of us) cannot comprehend what drives them to be so hateful. I would've been really tempted to just quit midway. I don't have that kind of patience. 




 I really love the retro style! 




 I fucking love naan. I don't usually use expletives in expressing my love for food but goddamn I love it so much. Yours looks superb! 




 I'm not British but this looks like a "u wot m8" situation... 




 "Look at me. You will pick me. You will serve me for eternity." 




 That's what I thought too, like using the flag as a cape. 




 Was afraid this might have a bad ending. Congratulations! 




 Goddamn I hate it when people do that. For some, common decency just doesn't seem to exist. :( But it's good to see that this hasn't discouraged you from helping others. I think I would have called it quits easily myself. Though I don't smoke, I know a lot of people who would benefit from this and I thank you for continuing to help. 




 I think they're okay too. I don't like every song they make, but a lot of the songs in All the Right Reasons were pretty decent. 




 Actually this makes me happy for you. 




 Same here 2, also Canadian 




 Oh I didn't know that. Thanks, I'll check it out. 




 He's a giant dick now thanks to radiation poisoning. 




 Sorry you had to deal with those assholes. 




 Watching my grandpa's coffin being rolled into the crematorium.

Obviously I didn't see the oven. We said our goodbyes before the gate that led to the oven chamber. But I didn't expect them to bring out the remains before our eyes and then show us the grounding procedure. 

That felt surreal. 




 I imagine a slightly smaller one with a little surprise from John Doe. 




 Descent. The last woman probably didn't make it out of the cave. ... Probably. 




 It's kind of like sharks that would bite you to death and then say "oh, dude, sorry, I thought you were a seal. I'm... I'm so sorry." 




 Teleportation spell from Diablo II. I'll have to wave my arms like crazy though if I want to get to work from home, given the fact that I can only teleport to a location within my sight. 




 I would love this, except I wonder if I'll remember that I loaded the old save file? I don't think I can take most out of learning from my mistakes all that much if I forget... 




 Also I'd rather not feeling anything, so this sounds like a winner for me. 




 And I hear networking is really important in BDSM. 




 The way things turned out after Scar was put in charge was tad disappointing. The typical good people (Simba's.mom,.etc) suffering is predictable but even Scar and the hyenas had little to eat. Thought he was smarter than that. HE IS JEREMY IRONS. COME ON DISNEY 




 Do you enjoy it? 




 Hey Paul! 




 I think that's an excellent point worth digging into. But in the end he set his weapon loose to wreak havoc and tried to profit from it. I wouldve been more sympathetic about Syndrome's good boy gone bad personality otherwise.

 Glad I'm not alone in having hots for Bear Grylls. ♥ 




 I love the varying degrees of Cheese shades. Must they all squeeze themselves in there together? 3 They just know how to be cute, don't they. 




 Just like everyone here I think you found your look! It looks awesome. Also thanks for donating that luscious lock of yours. :D 




 They operate on a reservation basis? Must be really popular. Thanks for the info. Will check it out.  




 I wasn't surprised by this. I knew something was up :'( Hope things turn out for the better for both of you. I'm sure he's a fighter inside. 




 That's beautiful! Such detail. Consider submitting it to the Fight Club FB fan page. More people need to see this! 




 "Dude are you sure this is how it's done?" 




 I was going to say "can't wait for her to settle in and dominate the house" but it seems like the job is already done. Thanks for bringing her to safety! :) 




 Back when the Internet was still a new thing (Windows 95-98 era, I think) I saw that my computer was in danger, infested with malware and this nice company offered a program for just 49.95 to get rid of them.

I was like ten. I was afraid. 




 Totally. Same goes for carrots, onions, pretty much all vegetables.

I still hate beans though... 




 Yeah, makes sense. I myself am pretty much addicted to coke zero so I'll take the offer nine times out of ten. Non perishables or things you use on a daily basis at a large quantity, also understandable.

I guess I should've clarified in my original comment that I was thinking more along the line of clothes. 




 I'm sure Canada is still in Top 3 of the most polite countries... If not, then I do apologize in advance. 




 "Yeah. When we're done with it!" 




 I got my mom (in her 50s) into the trilogy and it's become an annual thing for us. Back in university we'd pick a week in the winter break and do the LOTR marathon.

Of course by watching I mean talking over all the scenes because we know what happens and just want to nitpick the detail. 




 Not very NSFW but I used to take screenshots of the Sims 2 and make comics. Also created clothing items. I'm pretty sure this was the major factor in bringing down my undergrad GPA. I should be ashamed of putting so much effort and time into doing something like that but I was happy doing it. Good memories... just had lasting repercussions. 




 Buying things whenever you see "up to __% off" or "2 for 1" sale.

If they had been meaning to buy those particular products, sure, but buying stuff just because it's on sale is pretty silly.

I give this as an example because I used to be like this when I was younger... What a fool I was.

Edit: typo 




 Wha...? This is some Disney teen movie stuff right here. Who does that? Jesus christ. Sorry you had to endure that :( 




 Well it's not like Frey needed another reason to be called a scumbag... 




 Brownie points for being a cat person. Not that he'd need any... 




 I remember installing Prince of Persia 2 from larger floppy disks (5-something inch ones). There were like ten of them! Now I can carry around 64gbs in my cell phone charm... All that progress in less than 30 years. 




 You captured each movement so perfectly! *resist making a pun*

This would make a really great sticker series 3

Edit: Just found out you only ship within the US :( Too bad. 




 You must make a calendar of her... She's beautiful! 









 I do want to see more of Futurama. People say the Simpsons has gone way past its prime and should have ended a long time ago but I still find the series endearing and funny. I'll probably feel the same way about Futurama if it is rebooted yet again. 




 "What are you, gay?" The phrase it self is totally dull but the context was flawless. A close second would be the one about how the spirit is willing but the body is spongy and bruised. :p 




 Awww they're made for each other. I can't wait for them to conceive a twisted hell spawn!

Man each time I post a comment here I'm typing things I thought I never would... 




 Wow I'm late to the thread and probably (and hopefully) you feel better by the time you read my comment but fuck that woman. Even if she was a super model she wouldn't have any right to say that kind of thing to anyone. I'm sorry you had the misfortune of crossing paths with that kind of nut job. :( 




 My usual course of action in this case is to murder the wife... welp this is a sentence I thought I'd never type. Thanks CK2! 




 Lol it seems like that's when Tom swung by Korea. He also starred in the Korean SNL and did some weird shit. Gotta love a hot guy with a sense of humour and Oxford accent 3 




 Seriously though. I want to know as well 




 MY GOD first of all the cherries look great! The kisses decoration is so well-done. It's something I'd never pull off. Well done! 




 Man once I get a taste of that I'll probably want exclusively that burger. 




 I'm relieved it's about excitement. He'll be thrilled!

I just hope he doesn't sell the tv to get you a present a la the gift of maji haha 




 I don't know... I would think the person was trying to befriend me if someone stuck an arrow in me and set me on fire... 




 "How come you have to shower so often? WHY ARE THEY PUNISHING YOU"

 "Is it me?" *raises one eyebrow* 




 I'm glad she met you! Hope she gets to run around soon and play with your kids. That'd be an adorable sight.

 I'm so sorry you lost him... And he was so young :( But I suppose he'll stay young in the kitty heaven forever, teasing other older companions. RIP beautiful Mr. Boots. 




 Is she Siberian?? She does look like a princess!

 Sweet mother of God a Tuxedo 3 She's gorgeous. And I love it when a cat and a dog become friends. Consider posting pics of her in /r/cats! 




 I love the detail on Slurm! Each figure looks like it would make a great keychain or necklace. wish i had this kind of talent! 




 I read the last part In Moe's voice automatically 
























 I see. Thanks for explaining it to me in detail. I already got the feeling that what I mentioned wouldn't be a big issue as there were no precedents.

My undergrad major was English literature but right now I'm enrolled in a law-related grad school program and studying intellectual property law. Students vary from lawyers to people like me, who have no prior knowledge of the discipline. Classes are scheduled in the evening (the program is designed for people working full-time) and each subject has only one class every other week so it's been difficult to take in all the material -- not to mention no subject thus far tackled my question here.

But thank you, your response cleared things up. 




 As someone who can barely cook eggs I appreciate the artistry. 




 FIRMLY GRASP IT 




 TIL. I also thought of edible crackers and didn't understand why it was pejorative... I thought it was cute. But now I know the truth... :( 




 She's got talent! May we expect another character next year? :D 




 So many good lines. It's hard to pick just one. 




 Man this seems trivial to all the others here.

I have a lot of work to do and an assignment due pretty soon for my night-time grad school. I don't even know what I'm doing in that program; I feel like I don't retain anything and I'm just wasting money and time. 




 I'm also clinically depressed. I have it more or less under control with meds but sometimes I wish I didn't exist.

Let's hope better days will come soon and light will appear in the fog. 




 Have you checked out Nostalgia Critic's review of the movie? 




 Happy Gilmore.

I know Adam Sandler's movies have gotten unbearable lately and when you think about it even the good ones in the past are the product of the same formula, but Happy Gilmore makes me laugh. Probably because when I watched it for the first time as a kid I was having the best night ever with my aunts. And my parents (avid golfers) always say they're so tempted to act like Happy Gilmore in the field. 




 While he got the award *SPOILERS* only because three other people that were nominated for the award got killed, but that still means he's in Top 4 so yes, he's really come a long way! 




 I don't know why you received one downvote. I thought the same thing. I upvoted to bring balance to the universe. 




 "I TRUSTED YOU..." 




 Wow. I feel like giving him a little jedi costume. He seems very, very wise. I'd call him cute, but I'm afraid he'll be offended and scold me :p 




 I'm so sorry you lost him... I can't imagine how difficult it must be. I'm sending you a lot of internet hugs... I hope his siblings give you some solace. 




 His... err, feet? legs? are really long! I thought mine had them long... incomparable to Kirby's. Look at that tummy 3 




 D'awwww Pancake is so pretty. I love the color! It's like cats' equivalent of strawberry blonde. 




 Is he called Vin Diesel because he won't listen to his agent?

Joking aside, he is one gorgeous kitty. 




 "I will smother you in your sleep..." 

But at least s/he is keeping the santa hat on. Mine would toss it and proceed to scratch my hands in retaliation. 




 Now you move a bit over... nyeah...

And you move a little bit over... nyeah...

And I squeeze in between like... nyeah... 




 Dear fairies, I surrender. ♥ 




 What's really perplexing for me is the fact that I can play a few matches without any problem and then bam the firewall issue hits. Why?? What happened in the last 40 minutes?

I wish there were some kind of signals that my teammates get when I'm desperately trying to reconnect so at least they know I'm not just off somewhere, completely ignoring how I'm ruining other people's game. 




 This is fantastic! I tremble at the thought of the new malph coming at me with his ult. 




 It hits me that I've been playing this game too long when I find Cho and Kog adorable. Now RekSai made my list thanks to you :D I wonder what her lines would be? Cho's "QUIETTTT" always cracks me up so much. 




 For a second I thought he was standing on top of the pride rock with his mane blowing in the wind. He's already so handsome but I figure he'll be even more gorgeous as he matures! Hope to see more of his photos soon :D 




 That's actually adorable. I'm trying to imagine what you would've said for Draven... 




 Me too. Especially because I could collect all champs and runes with IP alone if O had the patience!

Now I rationalize my spendiny by thinking that riot gave me an awesome game and I'm only appreciating their hard work. 




 No way my Cait has a flat butt!  :( 
Isn't she pretty decent in the sheriff and arctic warfare models? 




 Same, I was just dropped and all teammates dc'd around the time I did :s 

I can't log back in. 




 From the thumbnail I thought the photo was surely rotated clockwise... Nature never ceases to amaze me. 




 Oh yeah, completely forgot about Drake and Baron! I do like his relatively high sustain and slow with e but he seemed (at least to me) to be lacking in offensive powers before. I guess they could be made up by other laners. Looks like Nunu will make a comeback :) 




 Thanks for a detailed response! I'm playing from Korea so the distance is the main issue. I didn't have a lot of ping problem in S3 - early S4 (stable 150-180 range.) And since I'm using a cable and have no siblings or family members that download lots of porn (or anything big) I think I can rule that out.

I'll look into the VPNs you mentioned! :)

Edit: I tried out Pingzapper and they didn't allow me to run the League with a trial version so I purchased the cheapest package to see if it works. I gave it a go at work and it seems to cause firewall-related problems. It did have an option to bypass security, but it didn't work. I will try the program again later at home. 




 My friend usually gets something similar (150-200). I'm playing from Korea I've made peace with that, but ping increased after a certain patch (around the time of Jinx update I think) and seems to stay there.

And I'm using a cable. 




 I've been having a pretty high ping while playing the League. I am playing abroad but I usually got 130-180 ping. Now it's closer to 200 and sometimes I get lag spikes and reach 400-1000.

I've read about programs that reduce ping but am a bit skeptical. Any advice? 




 How..? My brain cannot comprehend the craftsmanship involved since I can barely knit. Great job! 




 He looks like he got this life thing figured out.  




 How does he function against the traditionally popular jgrs like ww or khaz? I feel like he doesn't have a lot of offensive moves and they can easily counterjg. 




 It would be great if the mystery skin mechanism took into account the most played champs... but I guess that defeats the purpose of mystery. I have a commander Kat and I'm horrible with her.  




 That. Is. Awesome. Extra points for securing the ornaments twice. I knew the white tree was special but didn't occur to me that it was ocean themed! 




 I don't object at all, but I do find partially clothed men a bit sexier. Loose dress shirt collar or shirt-off entirely, that sort of thing.  




 What little explorers! And hats off to you for daring to have that kind of pretty tree with felines present. 




 He has a habit of sucking his arm and imitates the nursing pose as he did with his mom. He's now almost 10 years old. It's the only time he ever purrs and whenever he does it he grabs my arm, feet, etc. His claws are pretty strong and they hurt like hell. 




 It was worth it 




 Dominant male persona. I hate dealing with macho types when working but in bed it's a different story. I've also asked my boyfriend to pin me down during sex, like holding me down by the wrists. Of course all these things must be done with someone I'm really comfortable with (i.e. bf). 




 Thank you. I'm working abroad and seeing this makes me want to cry. I miss Van so much. 




 Fluffy♥♥ 




 So if he became a judge he would be Justice Justice Joslin? 




 I too believed his shadow was added later. Kudos to you for going through all this trouble to find the truth! 




 I don't care what others said; he sounds a very sweet person. 




 I can't see much but my heart goes out to you guys. I hope Tux warms up to Sam and they get to be best buddies 3 




 I love your drawing style! Will definitely follow that link to tumblr. Keep'em coming please! 




 IIRC he learned fast but the proficiency was not just at the level of the native speaker so he had to be dubbed, but because he took time to learn the language the dubbing process went much more smoothly. But yeah either way his performance was awesome! 




 Wouldn't know about snow, but I definitely agree with the hot tub thing. It sounds sexy but like you said the lube is gone and we're kind of splashing in a tub against water resistance. On top of that part of me outside the tub is kind of getting cold. So yeah not the greatest thing IRL. 




 I rejected a guy in high school and he called my mom (during school hours) to tell her that I was making his life a living hell, that I was being disrespectful towards his mom (we crossed paths in an open house event; I kind of turned my head the other way because she knew about my rejection and I thought things would be awkward.)

I later confronted him and at first he lied to me and said he was just saying hi to my mom. I called him out on being a liar and being so immature about the whole mess (we were 17/18 respectively). He ground his fist against the wall like he wanted to punch me. I really wanted him to, so I could punch back, but he never did. I spent my entire Gr.11 fantasizing a grabbing a chair and bludgeoning him to death. 




 He cracked me up so much in The Invention of Lying. Made me want to punch him too -- but that's just evidence of good acting, I presume. 




 The movie came out when I was in high school and learning Spanish, and I read that you learned Spanish to fit the role. I really admire the dedication! It couldn't have been easy. 




 Well the imgur name was TheOtterGuy 




 The crust! I honestly don't get why crust gets so little love. It's equally delicious! 




 I stand corrected. Also happy cake day! 




 Princess Bananahammock 




 I'm ashamed to say I didn't recognize him until you said his Heroes name. Delish. 




 Fry what have you done?! your hair is all different-y! 




 I actually had no idea what Steam was before buying Skyrim. I bought the DVD as soon as it came out and when it was installing Steam I was like: DAFUQ IS THIS SHIT? Needless to say I'm in love with Steam now.

I bought the GOTY edition for Oblivion and it came with a map of Cyrodiil. That was awesome. 




 [I will personally kill you, and eat your entrails on my tummy!](http://imgur.com/hQsv6Xd) 




 I can't imagine the amount of concentration put into this work. Well done!

As for me, I would make maybe about one rose really badly, get frustrated, and then just pile them on top of each other without any artistry. 




 S/he can mock me all day long. Such a cutie. I love how cats have unique face masks of their own! 




 I can feel the fluffiness beyond my cellphone screen. My cat's gonna be hugged extra hard when I get home.♥ 




 Aww :( Luckily I can't even tell they were once hurt. You guys must have taken real good care of him3 




 Unfortunately no. But reddit is full of gifted artists! Perhaps there's a sub where you can make a request? 




 Move to the ROK, where the Internet is super fast but ridden with Active Xs. 




 I'm sorry you lost him op. I'm sure he is now in a place where the wireless connection flaunts light speed and there is no loading screen. 




 I'm sorry he's no longer with you. He looks magnificent using that mailbox as his pride rock. Wonder if the post officer was terrified/happy to approach him? 




 "My eyes precipitate at the very thought of you having to drag yourself to work." :D 




 Yay another pic of Sherlock!

I have to be honest though, he seems wayyy sweet and snuggly for a Sherlock. I hope he develops *character* as he matures. :p 




 He (she?) would make a great protagonist in a cartoon series. Look at that expression on his face! It has... depth. 




 Do they also fight to the death during the day? I love it when they pounce on each other like hell and then snuggle so dearly like nothing happened. I know it's play fight, but man, those fights can be intense. 




 You and your boyfriend rock!

Look at those pink jellies 3 My cat has cocoa jelly beans but I have a weak spot for pink paws and white socks. 




 He is adorable... I would have cried if I had to part with him! Hope his new family takes good care of him as you did. 




 This has "photoshop battle" written all over it! 




 Though not American (but Canadian, so hey neighbour!), I agree with this comment. 









 I should really use this phrase. It adds a little extra to the original. 




 Thanks for keeping him safe until he found his family! Hopefully the new family could send you some pictures later? 




 I don't blame you. In fact, I'm sure I'll end up doing the same thing. I can't imagine growing attached to them only to have to send them away. I'm sure serving the kitties is tough, but I envy you so much for being in the company of such gorgeous kitties! My cat sure could use a buddy but bringing in another cat is just not in the cards right now. 




 You should make a screentshot comic out of him(her?). Sounds hysterical. I imagine a giant Nord dude squatting down trying to pickpocket a wood elf. 




 Now all he needs is a Watson! Thanks for taking care of him (presumably him, given the name?) 




 Any mode featuring poros predominantly is fine by me! I can't wait to see a giant King poro. 




 This won't probably mean a whole lot coming from a stranger, but it's not your fault. It's extremely unfortunate you lost her that way. Hugs. 




 Good on you for stepping out of the comfort zone. Hope she calls you back! 




 Trying really hard to imagine what "using hair as puppets" might look like. 
She sounds like a very sweet person! 




 I think I'll endure the pain for the millisecond of fluffy goodness. 




 Prison Architect :) 




 So funny, I was about to link the same Oatmeal! 




 Fight Club.

It's been a while since I read it, but to me the book seemed more like a stream of consciousness. It must've been pretty difficult to set up a more linear storyline appropriate for a movie, and Fincher did a fantastic job. 




 Yeah, when I first saw it I was dismayed by some changes, but now that I look back on it those cuts were necessary. If I could change one thing though, I'd bring back the original Shire showdown. 




 Homer Simpson despite the sex differences.

A chubby guy who doesn't know much about his work but has been on amazing adventures, well-liked by most people, married the woman of his dreams, etc. Also given the progress and life span of the series I'm quite certain he's immortal. 




 What's his/her name? So adorable! 




 I love the expression on his/her face. "Calm the fuck down." 




 In my first (relatively) successful escape I got stuck in the gate that was supposed to block the monster off. It was unable to hurt me but I was stuck and couldn't move at all. I just lost the will to continue :( 




 I think that was sarcasm. 




 Reminds me of Misfits! 




 I see. In that case I guess I could see why it would be displeasing to some. Still I doubt it justifies all the hate this man is getting. 




 Also working against water resistance isn't all that fun. 
























 I love how they all squish in against each other 3 




 I knew I recognized her! Thank you so much for providing her a good home. I hope she gains some weight soon. 




 I remember this from a sociology prof back in my undergrad years about how these sexist lines in sitcoms (an example at that time was Everybody Loves Raymond) often go rather unnoticed because the female character's retaliation soon follows. Everyone laughs but the stereotype is still there (e.g. women belong in the kitchen / should be docile, etc.) and perpetuated. 

We weren't talking about this seriously and I didn't exactly see that type of gag as a problem, but I thought it was interesting regardless. 




 Asian and stuck in low Silver. I've brought shame on my family. 




 That's such a sultry come hiether look. Beautiful! 




 My god they are so affectionate! They must really trust you. Thanks for being so kind to them. 




 I'll steal a plate just to hear that thundering roar of the Imperial guard 




 I am so so excited. Will she able to ship overseas? I'm in Asia right now.

Of course I understand she's still considering so no need to rush detail. :) 




 Is she a professional quilter? That is amazing! She should open up a store on Etsy or something. 




 I too love SP but arguing that it's acceptable to say fag because SP uses it frequently and "redefined" it in that one episode with Harley riders, sounds so dumb.  




 Holy crap she looks just like Emma Watson. And I don't think that's all because of makeup. I'm really envious... 




 Guess that's where Fantastic Mr. Fox settled! 




 He's also feisty as hell. Middle finger raised high in the Hobbit making film lol 




 Is this some kind of super secret anime series the knowledge of which must be earned, not given? 




 [Her comment photo](http://i.imgur.com/UCw9Lsh.jpg) was way nicer than the one she posted. Sure the difference in the colours of her eyes isn't that obvious, but I can still tell she has one greenish hazel eyes and another with blue. 




 You are a champ. I'm glad you're still with us to share your experience. The strength and positive attitude are really inspirational. The iron prosthetics look cool as hell. If I had RES I'd tag you as 50% iron man. Keep on rockin' it. 




 I was feeling bad for him and then he said a bunch of stuff about how all their comments mean nothing and don't help him at all. Also he told a guy to "go die". Wow. It's hard to support him when he himself made the post and refused to accept any advice. 




 I had to move with my cat overseas and in my case he was put in the part of cargo storage with temperature control. Had to endure 12+hrs including the immigration and security check :( 




 Those ears. Those eyes. They all raise a red flag. And yet I remain motionless and keep on staring! -- Cats' gaze causes paralysis. Confirmed. 




 Oh could that be the reason? It was protected, but they allowed me to copy (albeit only some) so I figured there was no problem. :( 




 Absolutely love him in the series. Even more endearing that the character was based on Lee himself. 




 His totally chill attitude makes me love him even more. Apparently he's incredibly humble and there was great disparity between the Thranduil persona and his actual personality so he was apologetic to fellow actors! :p 




 I think so too. Sometimes their jokes are really low brow and not very funny but they have some good episodes too. They seem to be turning it around esp in recent seasons. 




 "Report my cat for griefing" 




 Poison one of Coke zero cans. I'm pretty much addicted to it so it's bound to kill me one day. 




 Baby it'll blow your mind. 




 I watched Vertical Limit last night. Safe to say I'm doomed. 




 I feel like you also own a trophy for being the most non-competitive! 




 I don't believe you. 




 Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter.

I'm not a big fan of the franchise so I'll leave this up for hardcore fans to decide, but at least the way he looked in the first installment was just what I imagined for Harry Potter. 




 wp! I think the laughter in the end killed him twice. 




 I hope they add another item that includes NLR... :( 




 I hate toxic players/ragers and am in S5 myself, but I think you need to just ignore this type of people from the get go and forget. I have a feeling you're fairly young (correct me if I'm wrong) and his words may seem very personal to you. Trust me, it's not.

Also I think this goes against the subreddit rule "no personal sob stories". Just a heads up for the next time. 




 I think this will be a good compromise. I think Lux can still be pretty powerful with the standard AP runes (magic pen + armour + flat AP glyphs and quints) especially now that Talon can no longer silence ;_; 




 Umm wow... excuse me while I drool. He's gorgeous! 




 Was not aware of the fact that jars were trending. In any case this seems like a wonderful idea for key lime pies! I love them but they always collapse when I'm half way done eating a piece. This is an elegant solution! 




 I have a siamese x turkish angora mix cat. He used to be a sweet kitty with a lot of patience but as he grew older he's become increasingly manipulative. He knows the scheduled meal times but would extort mom into giving treats early by clawing sofa. I don't give in since I don't give a crap about the sofa but mom does so he keeps doing this :s

Another peculiar thing is that he doesn't ever purr except when he gets sleepy and sucks on his arm in the kneading motion. He does this only around me so I should feel blessed, I suppose! 




 Something like "of course you have to wait 5 years. Citizenship should not be given out. You should stop sounding like a brat that finally got she wanted" 




 Damn as a Vancouverite I wish BC could be one of the more badass houses but I don't think we can be Lannisters... 




 Ahaha yeah there were a character limit. Having to type Pr. Edward I. irked me so much as well. 




 Maybe he was a dick to his beaver too :( 




 I think you can pick up a beaver at the local pet shelter. And everyone knows Safeway is obligated by law to provide you with emergency maple syrup :D

Joking aside, congrats! 




 Really hope he can go back to looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/5uJtgRu.jpg)... 




 You should give him a little sarcophagus too! 




 I can definitely see where Matt   Trey are coming from. FG has such amazing voice actors and gag potential but they made some really crappy episodes especially after the show came back for Season 4. It's frustrating to see that they have that "the bird is the word" kind of thing when they could be way funnier. 




 I'm in an MA program right now but I actually feel so dumb and really insecure about myself. I'm not sure where these people are getting this kind of confidence. 




 I remember there was another SRD with people asking OP for the original source when he changed captions of an ad and he got really defensive. He ended the conversation by saying something along the line of "whatever, I'm going to bed and have sex. Bye, losers". So this is what it boils down to in the end? Apparently no one else on the internet is having sex besides these guys?

I get they want to just end the argument. Sometimes people just can't come to an understanding or compromise at all. But to go out with that "doesn't matter, I'm having sex" remark... He may be in his late twenties but his mindset doesn't seem mature enough to consider marriage. 




 I made these some time ago when I came across a post by an American redditor who created house sigils for US states with [the sigil creator](http://www.jointherealm.com/). I had to make do with default cliparts available on the HBO website so some of them don't resemble the official flags, but I tried :p Enjoy!

[The album](http://imgur.com/a/0FmxN) 




 For someone who lectures against lazyass-ism that user has a lot of free time on his/her hands... 




 I get the feeling his/her parents are probably responsible for this kind of elitist thinking. Most kids I've met that are like this have really condescending parents. They change their mindset the exact moment their kids don't get into the Ivy league. 




 Thanks for posting. The album was gone by the time I got here. I thought the one who gave CC might have been too critical but now that I see the actual photo... wow. I don't think she was harsh in any way. 




 OP sounds like a very sweet girl and I really hope she sees she doesn't deserve this kind of shitty treatment, constantly being compared to girls that her bf used to know in high school.

Also:

He actually does have mental problems: severe suicidal depression and bi-polar disorder. I'm the one who called the ambulance miles away from him when he went missing and was about to commit suicide. That's how we started dating.

I'm clinically depressed myself, but I don't think this is the ideal path to starting a relationship. 




 Reminds me of American gothic! 




 Look at that beautiful coat! Just shows how far love and care go in any creature's well being. Thanks Op for being awesome! 




 I envy that! I'm working abroad right now and it's difficult to explain what Reddit is. People have trouble understanding that Reddit can encompass people of all nationalities, cultures, etc. Most people picture Yahoo / MSN type of website. 




 This is really surprising. I thought the US was undoubtedly the most reddited! I suppose most Icelanders are lurkers? I don't see a lot of posts in their perspective in AskReddit questions and whatnot. 




 Oh man I didn't know that... that's a bummer. But from what I read here he married a very interesting person who lives with enthusiasm and drive so that's really awesome. As I grow older I've compromised my fan girl infatuation so that I'd be happy when the actors I like date someone like JGL married, or actresses I like (e.g. currently Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.) 




 Although there is ample evidence that Pannucci's has a disgusting cooking environment, it has always made me crave pizza. 




 I had to stare it for a few seconds to see if the ship was printed out. Really well done! Would love to see character paintings too. :) 




 AHH I'm so envious now... You must collect other weapons and boast them all in a long corridor lit with candles! 




 I really love the colours of the Sun one! Where do you plan to hang them? 




 That looks beautiful. I've always wanted to get something like that (for instance Aragorn's Anduril) but I feel like it would seem so out of place in my otherwise very plain room :s 




 That was also the first thing I thought, but then I realized how tiny they would be. Cute, but not very functional as a letter opener haha. 




 Your boss definitely sounds like a great person, but I'm sure you earned that kind of good gesture as well! Even the coolest boss would find it difficult to be that nice if you weren't already a great employee. 




 I love that content look on his face! I can almost hear the purring :3 

It's so good to see a cat that appreciates that kind of effort. My cat would scratch it off his neck :/  




 I should mention that this is not my cat but that of a Korean illustrator Snowcat. See http://snowcat.co.kr/ for more photos! 









 I would really like to have to a heart-to-heart talk with my cat. Want to ask him if he's happy. Ever since I moved to work he's locked up in an apartment with nothing much to look at. (Back home he would look out the window and enjoy scaring unsuspecting birds.)

Also this: why do you wake up in the middle of the night at 3am to yowl when there's fresh water, a bowl full of food, and a clean litter box?? 




 Mom is right for telling you that you're not cut out to be a lawyer. Follow your passion in literature and work hard on THAT instead. 




 Deckard Cain. I was actually really mad at Blizzard for taking him out while keeping that insufferable Leah. Now who's gonna tell me to stay awhile and listen? ;_; 




 When I was four I had to take a rather long walk to attend piano lessons. I still remember climbing down a very precarious, steep stairs and navigating through maze-like streets. 

I didn't particularly enjoy practising, but in retrospect I'm glad I was given the opportunity to learn the instrument. I wish I worked harder on it. 




 I'm enrolled in a master's program and it's costing me a lot of money each term. The least I can do is to get the degree but I have little clue in regards to what my thesis should be about. Since I'm working full time and going to school at night I'm exhausted and feel like I'm not retaining anything. 




 I have thin straight hair that cannot be permed under any circumstance. I really wanted to have luscious curls but every hair stylist said I'd only be wasting money. :( So I've had the same shoulder to waist length straight hair for the past decade. Layered with bangs. 




 I managed to save up a decent amount of money while donating to charity. It will eventually be used to pay off my debt to my parents (tuition-related) but I'm happy I've saved up that much so far. 




 I'm so happy for you! I remember that feeling. University years were undoubtedly the best time of my life. Hope you have a good one! 




 Complacency. My current job is pretty okay but it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. But since it pays me relatively well and is stable, I'm afraid I'll just settle for this. I'm also working abroad when I'd much rather be home so there's that. 




 I feel like I saw him/her in /r/catbellies. I distinctly remember the Garfield-like quality! 




 White. Socks. Irresistible. 




 S/he is gorgeous! Those green eyes are just captivating. 




 I love it when they do that with their paw. It's like saying "five more minutes", except they can sleep as long as they want ;_;  




 She'll look beautiful with a little sailor costume! 




 I'm also annoyed by my cat knocking over stuff [but turns out they do it for a reason...](http://wanna-joke.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/funny-picture-comics-cat-bitch.jpg) 




 "You don't need to know anything else other than to adore and serve me."

Which is probably correct. XD 




 It's not fair... she's so pretty. Like haute couture beautiful. Karl Lagerfeld's Shupette has nothing on Luna! 




 Photos like this make me so envious of dog people. I can just feel the love 3 




 I doubt this will be much of consolation, but it seems s/he lived a wonderful life and had a great family since she got to be 22 years old. Sending you internet hugs. 




 Ok. 




 It's extremely frustrating when my original comment was my attempt to explain why people may take offense at OP's choice of the title. I didn't bash him. I know it was only a joke and I said it so in my first comment.

You said you don't care, and yet you continue to reply to my comment in length. What is it that you want to accomplish? I've already explained where my understanding of the two terms came from. I grew up in Vancouver, Canada with both straight and gay friends, and learned that the term homo usually bore negative connotations. It is only natural for me to assume that the word also bears the same sentiment on the web.

Frankly I'm tired of trying to argue with a stranger on the web. You are twisting my words and taking in only what you want. I will no longer respond. Enjoy holidays. 




 I didn't decide which term is okay to say. It's something I learned from my gay friends, academic/casual debates, media, etc. Perhaps people around you have different opinion. If you think homo has no negative connotation, by all means, use it. 




 If you have time to spare.

http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/fashion/gays-lesbians-the-term-homosexual.html?referrer= _r=0 




 I'm upset because you accuse me of being uncomfortable with something I actually support. I'm not sure you keep getting the idea that I view homosexuality in a negative way. But it looks like you're adamant in that opinion so I'll stop trying to convince you. 




 Haha ok. No I don't think it's a bad thing and in fact I support gay marriage. Have you ever encountered gays that refer to themselves as homos? Have you even read my comment? My qualms here was the use of the term homo (NOT homosexual) and the fact that it is widely recognized to be pejorative. The expression "no homo" is often used among people who disapprove of homosexuality. If OP said something like "I'm not gay but" people here wouldn't post negative comments.  




 I'm so sorry you lost her. Holidays must be especially tough. Sending you a lot of hugs.  




 " *sigh* I've been givin' these out for 647 years...' 




 I think you should update your original comment with this info before the shitstorm hits. It definitely made me better understand why you'd be concerned.

Edit: nevermind, the storm is already here. 




 Wow thanks for the info! I usually use the app for purchases and it's a bit annoying to think I may have overpaid considerably because the app failed to reflect the correct prices... TIL. I should go back to using the website! 




 Could someone explain the reference? 




 Content arbitrary trusting and brave? I shall conquer you in bed behind your wife's back and manipulate you to tend to my every whim... muhahahaha 




 While I can clearly tell OP only said it as a joke, it is my understanding that the term homo is strictly pejorative. I see men commenting on /r/ladyboners but they never say "no homo". Instead they'd say something like "I'm straight but so and so is hot".

EDIT: Apparently my view is not widely accepted. Downvote me to oblivion. 




 Man talk about mixes messages. Must resist walking into a fluffy but lethal trap....♥ 




 "Paying attention to something other than me? Impossible!"

Also I tried to guess what game you are playing but I can only see so little! 




 My god. Those dire wolf figurines... If I were your coworker I would be staring at them whenever I pass your desk. Those are awesome. 




 "I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin." 
























 I bought my first house in Whiterun, did perfect setting for the kitchen table and boom the next time I came home everything had reverted to the default and the new things I added were lying on the ground... 




 Chances are you know about this already but this website/book is my goto reference for g.o.t. meals

http://www.innatthecrossroads.com/ 




 Lol same here. But I suppose watching your dog eat a cake that looks like him/her would be kinda awkward.

Kudos to you op, it's an impressive cake! But I'd feel somewhat guilty eating the cake that looks like a cute puppy ;–; 




 Is this a home recipe? I'm a novice when it comes to baking but I'd like to have a go at this, if you don't mind sharing it. 




 God butter cream is the best. I try to stay away from it lest I lose all self control and devour it all. 




 Did you make it yourself? It's really pretty! I've never been a big fan of mangos but I'm willing to give another shot at it with this! 




 Sometimes /r/food baffles me. OP shares a nice dessert recipe, something you may wanna try out when you feel like it, and people are either criticizing the time required for prepping the dish or fighting over the potential loss of vitamin c. If you don't like it why not just hit back and move along? 




 The cake looks delicious and the t-rexes are adorable!! I imagined something overthetop like dinos in a swamp or something haha. 




 Would risk getting clawed for that fluffy goodness! 




 S/he's like a fluffier version my cat!! So adorable 3 




 I'm sorry you had to say good bye to Willow. Her purring must have meant to comfort you as well, asking you not to be sad because she is now free of pain and frolicking in the kitty heaven. Sending you hugs. 




 Whenever the show/book presents this kind of predicament I usually have my own answer about how to handle things but damn, this one really left me at a loss for words. Even from Jon's POV too in terms of trying to convince him. 

It almost feels like Mance would've been murdered by one of the wildlings that felt betrayed and thought he sold them out, even if he had taken a knee. :( It was no win situation for him all around... 




 My cat is now 10 years old and still kneads on my hand while sucking his arm... I wouldn't mind except his claws hurt! 




 Rabbit that will hop on the world! He is adorable. ... I mean fierce! 




 I totally agree with you. I get from the corporate perspective the RP option is much more profitable, period. But chromas is hardly worth the RPs they ask for :( IPs seem like the reasonable alternative. Not to mention, for now, chromas in PBE don't look so appealing to me. 




 ... now you're pulling me further down to the fluffy abyss 3 




 I upvoted for visibility and I hope you get a response but it seems unlikely :( hope I'll be proven wrong. Best of luck to you. 




 Oh I see! I still have to learn the subcategories haha. Beautiful regardless! 




 Must. resist. petting the monitor ;_; 




 /r/catbellies will love this! 




 I know right! So far I have bagcat, blep, catbellies/gifs/highfive/loaf, jellybean toes and of course, cats. It must be true that the internet is populated purely by cats... 




 Siamese 3 His/her chocolate ears and blue eyes are so beautiful. Well photographed too!

Mine is mixed with a few other breeds so he only has a very faint lilac point. 




 Such a pretty colour combination. I usually have difficulty telling whether a cat is a girl or a boy (even though I have a cat myself) but your kitty has "pretty girl" written all over her face! 




 HAHA that is so cute. My cat has done that to me as well. 




 Oh my, seven! That is so adorable! More photos please if possible :3 




 The first photo os just perfect! "Wait I don't have my faCE on yet" :D 




 Alrighty will do! 




 I already love bencumb and martin freeman. It's Moriarty I can't stand! I was surprised so many liked him. Perhaps he is better in subsequent seasons? 




 Oh man I envy you so much! So beautiful. But RIP your black clothes ... I have a Siamese x Turkish Angora mix and he sheds like crazy. I can only imagine what the price may be for the marvelous fur of this magnitude. 




 Aww they must be really good friends if the cats feel comf enough to loaf near his face! 




 Is s/he loafing on top of neatly folded clothes? If so then it's such a cat thing to do xD  




 Let's try to stay strong. It's comical at this point how utterly trivial things like having a good lunch can cheer me up a bit. I do come across bad days but I try to remember I hit the rock bottom so I can bounce back.

Love you too and sending you hugs! 




 I would be a train wreck without my meds. Might not work for some but I was lucky enough to find pills that worked for me. Now I'm functional dysfunction! 




 True. I used to live in Vancouver west and needless to say the cost was outrageous. 




 Ashamed to admit curiosity got the best of me and had to look through his comment history.

http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/31n9no/how_did_you_find_out_that_your_so_was_cheating/cq34ges

Guess bad experience  really made him bitter and kind of lose sight of things... 




 For some reason s/he reminds me of Cersei Lannister haha 




 I feel you on "I don't want to die but I don't want to exist" conundrum. After a certain point even death lost meaning to me. Guess it's a good thing. 




 I would love to just get in there and pet its majestic fur. But then I remember how much it hurt when my cat "playfully" scratched me and the persistence with which he pursued me after I hid... 




 You have a great voice! And I love the look on your son's face. "Daaad XD" kind of expression haha. This will be such even cuter in the future. I wish this subreddit were more active so more people could see this. 




 I love BC to death but I have to admit it's a great place only if you're ready to retire with a lot of money. :s I'm working abroad at the moment and hopefully one day I'll get to return home to have a house of my own... 




 I've seen this already but had to upvote it anyway because of Varis in this end. 




 I stopped watching Sherlock after Season 1 but goddamn now I have to catch up! I need to know how it came to this! 




 Congratulations! :D Beware underwater cigars! And I'll help you move your piano as long as it doesn't have to go upstairs. 




 Yup completely agree. Sometimes I've gone elsewhere after work so I could be alone somewhere in peace.

I hope you have a subreddit where you feel more at home though. Going to food and aww subreddits put me more at ease and make me smile. 




 Ahaha I know that look! S/he's precious3

My cat would groom and then kind of stare vacantly at nothing in this pose. Like he suddenly had an epiphany. 




 Awww. But also the cat has the "ugh this shit again" face 




 I keep finding out about these after blep brushybrushy highfives... they are all so awesome. Thanks for sharing. 




 The dog seems to feel very guilty indeed. 




 I'm so relieved you and the pretty cat were unharmed. :) 




 Fantastic Mr. Fox finally overcame his fear! 




 I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to American politics so it didn't even occur to me that Agnew was more than just a Futurama character. TIL haha 




 Good for you! I also love it when servers ask for id. It boosts my self confidence sure but it's always nice to see people who are thorough with their job. Keep it going bud and good luck with triathlons! 




 Damn, must you have everything? Your cats are perfect ;_; Please keep us posted in /r/cats about their, um, lack of shenanigans. haha 




 Thank you so much! I love the one where they're by the window. Beautiful kitties 3 I hope they are as well behaved as they are cute! hehe (though it seems the two factors are usually in an inverse relationship lol) 




 The look on his(her?) face in the last shot is just so adorable. Also I'd like to get him a hotdog outfit. 




 I get where he's coming from and I can see why some people don't really like Oblivion as much. But if I remember correctly, certain parts of the game heavily implied that peace and calm (what is referred to as "normal" in the game) were only superficial. Maybe some gamers wanted to see this more played out and presented as a real issue that the hero of the game had to deal with... 




 I really feel that rabies should be like affliction. Also I don't exactly understand why it increases DMG while reducing ACC. wouldn't it make more sense if it made the hero more susceptible to enemy DMG or something? Of course if this were to apply there would have to be less chance of getting rabies. 




 I miss those years. Granted I still love my cat to death but at times I miss his younger, more playful days when he actually paid attention to what I was doing to play with him.  




 Now this is where the phrase Alpha as Fuck actually applies. 




 I am so sorry you lost him. May he rest in the kitty heaven with a lot of toys and treats. Sending you internet hugs. 




 He walks like a lion! Beautifully photographed too, not that he needs to be any more photogenic! :p 




 My cat isn't allowed on the table but does it anyway if he wants my attention. Your cat is much more subtle in his protest... and so cute! 




 Both of them look like they'll be so much fun to hang out with. Lena in particular. 




 I have never met you and yet I had the biggest smile on my face as I read your post. I missed the first one but I'm so glad I got to see both today! I'm as old as your bf (albeit I'm a girl and straight) and am in a relationship and yet I'M SO JELLY 3 I feel like hugging you, screaming in joy alongside you, do other kind of nonsensical stuff in celebration. I wish you guys all the best! 




 Those arms... hnnngh 




 Would you consider converting this into a flash game while still employing the in-game purchase system (kind of like Kingdom Rush)? I understand the programming would be drastically different but I personally feel strategy games like this one would play much better in PC.

Good luck with the release and hope to see the final product on Andorid soon if possible. 




 Didn't have this in my collection. Thank you! 3 




 Nice! Now if we can just get the fast travel system IRL you'll be all set.

Also on the side note: to me 3D printing technology is still something very science fictiony (never tried one myself) and it makes me smile whenever I see something like this. If I had the device I would probably print all the items in the game. 




 The greatest discovery since /r/blep and I forget the exact name but the one with kitty tummies. Thank you! :D 




 Is she also part bear? So adorable! Also welcome to the Master Race('s group of servers). :D 




 Not sure about the spelling, but it is my understanding hamburg steak is the Japanese equivalent of salisbury steak. Different from a hamburger. 




 Yum! It's 1:30am where I live and I'm looking at this. Why am I doing this to myself... 




 The icing on Elmo is literally icing on the cake! Usually they look too sharp and tend to ruin the overall image but your wife did a wonderful job. 




 At first I thought the crusader's Bulwark skill was completely useless but then I realized it's pretty useful when dealing with the more powerful enemies and bosses.

The same could be said for weakening/debuffing curses. I think the occultist/vestal and the bounty hunter go well together since the latter doesn't have to spend a turn to mark/stun enemies. The curses/stun skills may end up crit'ing and provide some stress relief and the bounty hunter moves in for the kill. 




 I like the idea of having monsters rise against Hamlet! I would love to have some more new initiatives in the game. Right now I have the champion level bosses waiting for me but I already know their pattern... 




 Haha I actually started a thread on Steam about a similar topic yesterday or so.

I grieve for the first Crusader and Highway Man. It's like losing someone who began the quest with you :( I have three separate games going on in the DD right now so they are still alive in some. 




 I gave it a try yesterday and it works out great! Really handy when stunning units that haven't taken any action yet. 




 I have yet to upgrade all the facilities (the survivalist upgrades are so expensive) so I haven't thought about that. Since more dungeons are in development maybe we'll be able to upgrade shops further with heirlooms. Hope to see more variety on that note too but it is probably unnecessary. 




 That would be neat! But also pretty difficult. I haven't found a lot of class-exclusive trinkets. Only about two rows' worth in the trinket box. 




 I second this idea. Maybe +10% of the quest gold or something? 




 I'm a bit new to the DD subreddit so this might have been discussed earlier but here's my suggestion:

1) Option to sell trinkets

I think this one is a no brainer. I see a lot of people asking for this option on Steam. I don't even want a great payout either. I wish I could get at least SOME money back for trinkets that I never use. 

2) Combiner / Gamble

Something I mentioned in my comment in the Steam community.

Similar to the Horadric Cube in Diablo II or the rune combiner in the League. The player is allowed access to a combiner after completing a veteran level quest (or champion, if the developers see fit). Chuck 2-3 trinkets into it and generate either (a) a trinket that combines some of the properties of the input or (b) a totally random trinket. This way completing previous quests again would have a new perk: get old trinkets that you can gamble with.

I think I can deal with occasionally shitty RNG. I just wish there were more ways to salvage trinkets. 




 Totally. I mean it hasn't come up that often for me fortunately (60+ week) but when it does I hate walking back and forth. I like taking 20 food for medium missions and maps like this make me waste food. I want to save some for extra stress relief goddamn it :( 




 I really like the Jester and would love to feature him more in my quests but his spot is usually filled by the Plague Doctor or the Grave Robber. Your build seems a bit risky for my taste (no tank!) but I'll give it a shot. I didn't realize Solo could be a good opening. I usually have him do early Harvest or Slice Off to inflict bleed damage. 




 Such Prussian blue! But his name screams Irish. Pretty... 




 "*sniff sniff* oh no you didnttttt" 









 Squeal in joy and then realize I have to clean up all their poo :( 




 KOEI's Uncharted Waters has really great music. A lot of them were composed by Kanno Yoko. [Caprice for Lute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZfyXEXaLuI) 




 [FIRMLY GRASP IT!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5n5KlXv0Vo) 




 Same here. In my case I'm working abroad and I don't think I'll get paid as much back home.  




 I realize this is just a digitized image, and he didn't ask me anything. But I automatically said yes. The force is strong in this one... 




 She is adorable. Tiny tiny lady 3 This photo seems to encompass all things that make cats so charming. They don't run away, but it's not like they trust you entirely either. You got their attention just enough so they can keep on studying you. Kind of like friendship stuff talked about in Le Petit Prince! 




 I had to look very hard to find the head. So tiny3 




 He looks like Balto! 

I shouldn't be sad because he's getting a home of his own, but damn... his eyes... :') 




 I'm sorry she had to leave you soon, but I'm certain she was a fighter and didn't lose the battle. She had the last laugh and is having an awesome time in the kitty heaven with an unlimited supply of treats and toys. Sending you a lot of hugs. 




 I've seen this before on /r/ladyboners and I remember it because I tilted my head to look down his trousers in the same way I just did right now. Thanks for posting again. You can never have enough Fassboner. 




 [For your viewing pleasure](http://i.imgur.com/5qLpbSQ.png) 




 One of the heirs with high intrigue points will surely concoct an interesting scheme... 




 Well said. Couldn't agree more. 




 Nice! Another good one would be the one where Leela is photographed at the Orphanarium (I think in Leela's Home World?) 




 /r/aww can be oddly hostile sometimes. I guess it just shows how much people care about the well being of animals, at times to a degree where it can make them irrational. 




 That nonchalant look. Nailed it. 




 "Dude what's the password" 
























 Improved nightingale bow and chillrend (both Flawless grade). Really love paralysis chance! Sometimes I switch to Nightingale blade for health and stamina absortion and mace of molag bal for soul traps. 




 I'm an apprentice wizard, not a pack mule! 




 "If you want strength and unity, you join the imperial legion. If you want to fuck your sister you join the Lamecloaks." 




 That must be nice to have. I hate how NPCs in Skyrim walk too fast when I myself walk, but they're slow as hell when running. (or abruptly stop altogether! what's up with that!) Following that dog Barbas was trying to say the least. I didn't realize I'd have to walking that far... 




 These are so much better than store-bought $5 per piece macaroons. I really like Cookie Monster ones! Yummm 




 Robert Redford 3 I think he has a softer edge, more "good boy" look. Brad is beautiful too, but Redford is classic. 




 God I hate it when I pass by her. "What, I'm not scared of you. I'll fight anyone!" Only a child would dare to annoy someone who's bored of killing dragons... 




 On top of that, what would you do with a golden cup? It's not like merchants will buy it off you without reporting you to the authorities for greater rewards, and you can't eat the damn cup when you're starving to death... 




 Knowing when to use a and the. It's very minor but it seems arbitrary at times. 




 Iirc she was accused of sleeping with multiple men and was imprisoned. 




 I love how this idea is so plausible in GRRM's world. 




 The charges are different from those in the books so I wonder if she'll be treated as harshly. I think I'll endure Margaery's momentary pain if Cersei faces her ultimate shame... Would Lancel sing before the High Sparrow? I hope he does. 




 Yeah, now that you mention the lyrics it seems Bronn is a goner. Such a shame... I loved his quirky character. I like how --despite I mourn Tyrion's (albeit temporary) downfall-- Bronn stuck to his character as a sellsword and was not swayed by words of a "friend". If he does go I'll miss him terribly. 




 I kind of smile remembering Lilly Allen's song about her brother. If that song bore any truth he came a long way. I've always enjoyed his scenes, whether they were heartwarming (with Robb) or utterly despicable (Winterfell siege). Really well-rounded. His Reek performance feels so genuine, I want to buy him a good cup of tea and tell him he can still make things right. ... though knowing GRRM I don't know where he could begin... 




 That is so true. I keep believing in vain hope and get sucker punched. And I come crawling back to GRRM... Only HE would keep his audience in a sado-masochistic relationship, fully satisfied. Damn. 




 I completely agree. As someone mentioned here I used to play the Sims like crazy and this dlc is perfect for me.

What's that, Serana? You want me to follow you so we can defeat the evil vampire lord? Sucks for you, have to go to Half Moon Depot to get lumber. 




 Wasn't there another post who's like thirty years old and never had any relationship in his life, blaming women for being so shallow? His comments were super pretentious and reeked condescension. They pretend like they don't care about what others think and yet they go on askmen and askwomen subreddits desperately waiting for someone to agree with them. why not just be honest.

Also 18 and all grown up? I hope he ends up cringing at himself later when he gets older. We all have experienced this but this guy is really doing his best to ward off any possible allies.

Oh wait, by his standard we are inferior to him so he wouldn't deem us worthy! Hurray! 




 The show cast, though brilliant, is too beautiful. Jorah - Iain Glen is one and them Iwan Rheon as Ramsay. Ramsay is supposed to be pretty repulsive in appearance but damn he's now hot as hell on TV. It also doesn't help that I watched Misfits haha 




 And I felt like he wanted to get away from Cersei. Get Myrcella, yes, but for her sake, not Cersei's. At least I hope so. The show Jamie hasn't showed a lot of change in his attitude towards CerseI but I would like to believe he's changed :s 




 Thank you :D 




 Still catching up with the books here: does he get greyscales in the book too, or is this tv-original? 




 That too, but I was also thinking that she might find a victim of Ramsay's cruel game of girl coursing.  




 "someone lieeeed! They said poor Cicero is... a lady." 




 It can't be good for my crotch 




 Thank you, I had to resort to console'ing. Luckily it did the trick :) 




 Thanks, I don't know what triggered it, but it turned out to be a bug after all. :s  




 Mayhaps that be Sandor Clegane? 




 A CEO of a major corporation in South Korea committed suicide after leaving a list of politicians that he bribed, one of which was the prime minister of the country. The PM resigned later on.

I was born in this country but am a citizen of another. Corruption pervades every aspect of life here... pretty sickening. 




 Oh did it say smoke you in the original? I saw it recently on TV and thought they'd censored it with the "less offensive" word haha 




 Ahahaha that's a very interesting idea. May I suggest you do it as a Nord? :p 




 Pragmatic! 




 You know the series is good when side characters are as memorable and likable as the main ones. 




 I can sympathize, but most NPCs give warnings first before zapping me... I wish vanilla Skyrim gave him more story. I didn't find any notes in his house explaining what he was doing. 




 Never thought of it that way. I should give this a try. I didn't bother taking up serious archery because hack and slash felt simpler and more ready at hand.

Does anyone use archery as it's supposed to: staying far from enemies and being all clandestine? I just keep shooting while I get hacked to death. :s So I end up reserving the bow for stealth missions. 




 I felt like that was more of the Thalmor's doing. And I saw a lot of Talos worshipers despite the persecution so it didn't strike me as that big of a deal... 




 Yup. Gotta take care of the Thalmor first before fighting each other. 




 Aww. Well, fair enough.

I too played (and am still playing) as a Redguard! I didn't particularly think the Nords were looking down on Redguards but yeah, I may have felt more partial to the Stormcloaks if I were a nord. 




 lol @ bear people. I suppose the Imperials came a long way since their days of racial inequality. 




 Any particular reason for choosing Stormcloaks? Aside from Ulfric being a badass of course. :D 




 You may have seen this already but... relevant :P 
https://youtu.be/KVeIid2Dv9Y 




 This is awesome! I didn't really get why Delphine was so stubborn on the subject. I should try this mod. Thanks! 




 - EMPIRE or STORMCLOAKS?: http://vote.pollcode.com/58192785

I think it's one of few quests that kind of made me sick because of moral dilemma. I myself chose the Empire because I was introduced to TES via Oblivion and well.. it's hard not to like Patrick Stewart's empire. Still I was sympathetic to Ulfric's causes. Visiting Windhelm became painful for me after his death.

- Did you choose to kill Paarthurnax?: http://vote.pollcode.com/32576536

This one was easy for me. I didn't kill him. It seemed plain wrong to kill the dragon after he helped me murder his own brother for the good of the world :s

I'd love to hear what you chose to do, and why. 




 Is this Drelas? I remember playing Skyrim for the first time and coming across his cottage. He was not nice. 




 Do mudcrabs still prevent fast traveling? D: I thought they let you travel when you're being targeted by mudcrabs and slaughterfish. Damn, Bethesda. They're not worth our time! 




 I always got this message when I visited the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary in Falkreath after [Dark Brotherhood Spoiler](#d "it was sacked by Imperial agents and burnt to the ground.") There would always be one archer trying to ambush me even after the whole quest line was completed. Not sure if this is a bug or the agents are meant to be there all the time... :s 




 S/he's beautiful! Any special planned for today? I've always wanted to try kitty-friendly bakeries. 




 Yeah, trying the NA server now and not getting any responses even after repeated attempts. 




 I'm certain I would eat it everyday if I could... There's something about it that makes it so addictive. 




 I love it when they all squish in together and make silly faces. 




 Are you sure you're not pulling our legs and posting a photo from a gorgeous kitty calendar? XD He is so photogenic!  




 Goodness gracious... Please keep us posted in /r/cats! I would love to see sequential photos of him/her growing! 




 Thanks for pointing that out. I thought it was exotic but didn't know what it was exactly. It really adds nicely to his character as a seasoned swordsman who's traveled everywhere! 




 Yeah, but I can understand the sentiment. The opening scene of S5E4 was so dark I was sure it was Gendry. 




 I was so touched by this scene. If it weren't for the whole red woman affair, I would be in for Stannis the Mannis all the way. But I suppose the inclination towards "ends justify the means" makes him more complex and human. 




 I agree completely. He did wrong things for reasons that he believed to be right. I mean, there are a lot of characters like that, but after reading his background history I could understand why he was so ruthless, albeit unable to condone. Also I loved how he was pretty much the only one who could threaten Joff. And then of course, the Charles Dance factor. It's like he was born for that role.  




 Oh wow thanks for explaining it in detail. I know pretty much nothing when it comes to baking. If you had told me it was sorcery I wouldve taken your word for it XD I'll be sure to try this! 




 All your modded goods are now forfeit. 




 I suppose so. I read that he was abused as a child by his mom, which is probably the root of his depression and misogynistic tendencies.

But what I meant by "extraneous causes" was more along the line of women -- who, according to his comment history, are nothing more than shallow liars. While there must have been some like that, I assume a whole lot more were driven away by his prejudice against women. 




 Welcome to the graveyard, dear Heir/Heiress. May your journey be lit with ample supplies of torches and food. 




 She's got pink AND cocoa jellybeans? That's not fair 3 so adorable. 




 How on earth did you make those swirls? They are in a very even pattern. Well done and happy birthday! 




 The thing I love the most about TES is that you can just go frolicking around in the wilderness, picking flowers and whatnot. It has a beautiful environment and the game lets you enjoy it to the fullest. 

Sure, there are portals opening to a scary dimension and dragons attacking villages but I NEED THIS MUSHROOM FOR MY POTION DAGNAMMIT 




 I think the shift in perspective stirred the people the most. 

They first thought he was just a timid but nice guy who needed encouragement. Hence all the advice and gilding. And then they found his other comments. People now feel like they've been fooled and think the guy was faking innocence. 

I don't think the guy feigned anything in his first comment, but I do think he's been unable to meet women (or make friends at all, since he points out in one of the comments) for a reason attributable to himself rather than extraneous causes. 









 I was waiting for him to knock the whole thing over! 




 I've really no advice to give you but just had to say you look fantastic. I especially love your church outfit!  




 Yum! It looks like a Skyrim dish too. :9 




 I was thinking that he might have been bored out of his mind in the brothel. It's like going to a party with a friend that likes to party hard when you'd much rather cozy up at home, watch a movie or something. 




 Thank you for detailing the differences! I'm still catching up book-wise. I'd vaguely read somewhere about Jeyne Poole and Sansa and I was confused when Sansa and Ramsay met face to face. I can't wait for future episodes as always! 




 God I miss home so much... I'm working abroad and seeing things like this almost makes me want to cry. I was not born in Canada, but it's the only home I choose to have. 




 The problem at the time was the title (many thought it was condescending, dismissive of people who did get a job) and his treatment of people that designed for him on a subreddit for free. There was some misunderstanding as well. A big mess for everyone. 




 I haven't tried out extreme group compositions like 3 grave robbers, but I do love the class (as my flair denotes!) 

I usually get lunge, dagger throwing, shadow stun (it's been a while and skill names fail me), and lastly whichever skill that suits the dungeon. I've found her accuracy and dodge modifiers to be very useful, more so because she deals a significant amount of damage + crits at the same time (as opposed to the Crusader's and the Leper's skills which take up one full turn without attacking the enemies).

But her elixir and poison dart skills are far from my favourites. Wish the devs would rework those skills :( 




 Beautiful! I can just feel the despair. It's funny how "permanent" deaths of your heroes can be devastating in a game even though I'm fully aware of the fact that they're just characters in a game and even replaceable.  




 I'm a bit late to the post so you might have already beaten her by following other advice, but here's my two cents:

- Try to avoid trinkets that decrease the death resistance

- At least one guaranteed healer or champion with heals. Even if the skill only heals by 1 point, as long as they can get someone away from the death's door. I refrained from taking an occultist with me because of the bleeding possibility and the position swaps.

- I'd recommend taking the Vestal and the Crusader for sure. 

- Equip characters with bleeding skills and trinkets. (Highwayman and if you can level up other heroes, Hellion.)  IIRC the Hag is blight-resistant but not so much towards bleeding and those ticks can be valuable when accumulated. 

- Highwayman's point-blank shot + Grave Robber's lunge can rescue those who are tossed into the pot with minimal injury. 

- The Crusader's rush-in skill (I forget the name, the one where he dives to the front) is great for attacking the Hag in the back when partnered up with the Highwayman's point-blank shot.

The Hag bosses were the most challenging for me as well, so I wish you good luck! It's so disheartening to lose beloved heroes to a witch that cooks people in a pot :( 




 For some reason Sir Charles reminds me of Jack Gleeson. In a good way. 




 XD replace Utopia with the League and I can kind of see how things must've gone down. Fun times. 




 Oh yeah, tons of cringe stuff for me as well. I'd like to think of it as the rite of passage that we all must go through in order to become a better --or less shitty-- person.

And then I see adults who have yet to complete this journey... 




 Other than the 9th grader IQ remark (which isn't nearly as bad as half the stuff we see here) it doesn't sound like you were that much of a smart ass haha. By "giving shit" do you mean they made fun of you? I too began surfing the net around that age but most people didn't believe me. 




 Give him some time and he'll hoepfully cringe upon recalling all the dumb stuff that he did when he was younger, just like the rest of us. 




 I remember there was a (then) 16 year old that titled his post "instead of getting a job I started my clothing line"... man. 




 I feel like calling her ma'am because she looks so dignified! What a beautiful lady. 




 "Mmm. It stinks. But, um, I do like the tiny doodles in the margins." 




 Got it. Thank you! 




 Thank you :) 




 I understood the term "leveled" as "deciding the quality of the item based on the character's level AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION". So I thought a unique sword obtained in level X would only have the damage of whatever damage that is set for level X for the rest of the game regardless of my future level ups. (Which I thought was true for Oblivion, and hence advice to postpone certain quests to get the best item.) But it seems the items level up with me. e.g. I got Molag Bal's Mace relatively early but the damage is steadily increasing with my level ups. So does the term "leveled item" actually mean their quality increases as I gain more experience?

As for damage enchantments: as I understand it elemental damages are added to the mechanical output --so if a sword can deal damage x and fire damage from enchantment is a, the total damage per swing is x+a-- whereas magicka and stamina damages attack only those qualities and not the enemies' health. Am I getting this correctly?

I went to TES wiki websites but I couldn't get straight answers. Insights appreciated!

edit: typos 




 Noice! Do you have the soothing whispery voice as well? haha

I really like Skyrim's Argonian voice. IIRC Khajiits and Argonians shared the same voice actor in Oblivion and it became boring wayy too fast.

Also I have wares of suspicious origins that I need to get rid of, if you're interested. 




 Yup, definitely happened to me as well! Sometimes I postpone leveling up when I know I'm gonna fight harder mobs later in the dungeon just in case my health regen / restore potions don't do the job. But damn, 0! I don't think I've pushed to that extreme. Well done. 




 Thank you so much for going through all this trouble. I was really curious about the quality of paid mods, if anything was really worth the money. Thus far I can tell there is none. (Edit: ok Akatosh one might be one exception.) 

Things like Enhanced Towns and Sounds of Skyrim, which I would gladly support the modder(s) with donations, are completely free whereas items that you documented charge people. What complete BS. 




 I'm so happy for you guys :') I assumed the worst since it's /r/offmychest, but I'm so glad your boyfriend is accepting you for who you really are. I wish you guys the best of luck... not that you need it! 




 Dawww so adorable. When my cat does this, however, I feel like he's doing it in a snobbish, affected manner like "you may now kiss the royal paw you pleb." 




 I've also confirmed this, but I think I'll wait a bit before celebrating lest it be premature...  Valve could not have foreseen the potential outrage when they decided to introduce it. It's doubtful they'd just get rid of it THIS quickly. I hope I'm wrong... I'm just gonna hold on to my boycotting just a little bit longer until they issue an announcement. 




 Holy crap... That is amazing. Congrats. I still have so much to go! 




 I usually scoff at boycott attempts but I sent email to Valve earlier with hopes that there's still a redeeming quality to the company we used to love. 




 "perhaps just the tip." 




 S/he looks so happy to be with you! Awwexplosion ;—; 




 Arya: "And I have this!" *presents the Coin*

Priest: "No, no... I take..." 




 Same here! I haven't caught up with the books yet and was so surprised to see him. And damn, that accent. Whatever it is, he's workin' it. 




 Did you marry the person? Are you happy? How did your friends/parents/etc. come to terms with your decision, if ever? 




 "There's a difference between being frank and being dick." 




 Dracarys [x] 




 Alas the happiness is not meant to last in GoT :( 




 I don't know, I've heard about how Lee Pace was feeling so awkward and apologetic to his fellow actors on the set of the Hobbit for being a gigantic but fabulous dick known as Thranduil. 




 I'm so envious of his wife. They look so happy together too. 
























 Great as always, and ditto on "as a woman I shouldn't even try to fight off children". I mean like dafuq? It's not like they were YOUR children! 




 Another Zoidberg fan here! I really like Billy West's choice of voice for Zoidberg. Even very mundane lines can sound very funny. I remember laughing hysterically in that parallel universe episode when one of the Zoidbergs said "The box says no" when asked to give it to the other Zoidberg.

But as in cases with most fictional characters, I may find him to be incredibly annoying in real life. Also quite scary given his lobster-like apperance :p 




 And Family Guy was saying how Charlie Brown sold crack to Snoopy and he overdosed on it! ALL MAKES SENSE NOW 




 Ahhh I see. Thanks. Looks like I was overthinking it haha 




 I love the fact that fans are still cosplaying Futurama characters after the show ended. The legacy lives on! 




 Oh my god! Thanks for posting. I thought the whole thing was original. Family Guy also parodied this but I never knew where it'd come from until now! 




 I feel kind of dumb, but I never really understood the gag point of that dialogue. :( I always thought Frankie actually was a cafeteria worker and the robot (that was showing Fry around) was confused that he was one of the patients. 




 "Shut up baby, I know it."

"*Kif sighs*"

"YOU ALL HAVE ZOIDBERG" 




 Agreed. I love Zoidberg (as my flair connotes) and episodes like "Why must I be a crustacean in love" was pretty strong but that had huge help from Fry, Leela, and Bender as well. 




 I feel this way about life... I could use some Futurama right now :( 




 "And stop sighing so much!" 




 Your costume rocks!! I hope he spoke to you in Zapp Brannigan's voice. 




 It's difficult for others to understand what real clinical depression feels like because the term is used so casually by people who are having a bad day. But really, you can't go tell a cancer patient "change your attitude about things and your cancer will go away". Some have it better and find counseling to be the key to getting over depression for good but the rest of us... we bear it for the rest of our lives and hope nothing exacerbates it. 




 Happy birthday, gsp2! I wish I knew your first name to say that instead of your ID. I feel like I got to this thread a bit late, so I hope you had a better day today. 




 I can relate to you in some part. Especially telling people that I don't care but in fact I do care. The important thing is though that you're doing something. And anger, though unhealthy in large doses, can be evidence of better things. For instance you have a goal and motivation to achieve it so you are frustrated by slow progress. But hang in there, and try to keep it up. And don't beat yourself up too hard. Leave that to the strangers on the internet. 




 I can't physically stop you but won't you at least talk to us? 




 I understand it's difficult to have a job when you lack motivation, but would you care to try finding something that you can do without a lot of social interaction? Perhaps something you can do over the internet. Having something to do can provide distractions. 




 I used to be nihilistic. And then one day I thought to myself: there is no point in being nihilistic itself. All these thoughts, moments spent in deep introspection, it's all for naught. It's meaningless to think about how meaningless life is. So I began to do something else. Watch movies. Go shopping. Do homework (I was in univ at the time). Sleep. I occupied my mind with other stuff and I became less fixated on the meaninglessness of my life. 




 That would make a great name. 




 "I probably would've smoked, I don't know, RAISINS, if someone told me it got me high". And now it's CARROTS! 




 I don't know why you were downvoted so hard. I enjoyed the episode personally (I just liked seeing Amy and Leela go crazy) but everyone's entitled to their opinion... 




 Ahhh you're right. I think I was thinking of Osgiliath. Time to hit the books again! 




 I actually conducted [a poll](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/351gpp/poll_the_empire_or_the_stormcloaks_did_you_kill/) and was surprised to find that more people (those who participated in the poll anyway) chose to side with the Empire. I thought the Stormcloaks would be more popular. 




 I'm more surprised by the amount of gold Belethor has! Did you buy that much from him or is it from the speechcraft perks? 




 I'm more into sword-fighting so I chose Red Guard. Red Guards have versatility when it comes to class so you can be a spellsword if you'd like to combine some magic into your battle. I don't like being too much of a glass canon... I'm too clumsy for that :p 




 That is so awesome. I watched a video clip of Jason Mamoa's appearance when the whole cast members were being interviewed at a comic-con during (or right after?) S1 and he had the full eye makeup done, memorized his Dothrakii lines from the show... He was amazing. I really appreciate when the actors respond to the fans' hype with equal amount of enthusiasm. 




 Agreed. I mean he still gets "hero" buffs and walks away from wounds that would cripple most men but that was certainly a nice touch, adding to the white walkers having supernatural powers. Not even the heroes are safe -- but then again no one is safe under GRRM's pen. 




 I was hoping the giant would use the dragon glass to fend off the white walkers... But guess he didn't need them after all; his feet were just as effective. 




 Edit: was thinking of Osgiliath but I'll just leave my comment as it was...

 I can definitely relate to the Minas Tirith scene. I love the Khazad Dum and Helms Deep scenes as well, but the battle at Minas Tirith had extra desperation to the atmosphere because Frodo was there. (I hope I'm remembering this correctly; been a while since I read the books / watched the movies.) Much more at stake, and we had Faramir who didn't entirely trust Frodo and Sam. So yeah, I can definitely see why it made you think of Minas Tirith. 




 I was really afraid that he'd die and the white walkers would have a giant on their side. Looks like he made it out of there though? I really hope so :( 




 People always joked about "and how far have whitewalkers come exactly? WHEN THE HELL IS WINTER COMING" and tonight we all got what we've been waiting for. Brilliant sequence. 




 One misdeed is enough to undo a hundred good ones.

Namely, you can kill evil dragons and save the entire world but that's not gonna give you a break when you accidentally pick up a jug at a general goods store. 




 I know it's just a series of quests but as someone who'd rather hack and slash with a sword than practice magic, I have no freakin idea why they chose me as the arch mage. Were they like, "fuck it I don't want this responsibility. let the Dragornborn do it. She's used to doing chores anyway." 




 Do regale us with tales of guests taken by surprise! 




 Let me guess... someone stole your sweetroll. 




 What was her name? Lift-up-her-tail? That looks like a product of so much effort. The head is really freaky... in a good way! Really captures the, uh, Argonian charm.  




 I like random fighters that I meet on the road. They taunt me while wearing expensive armour and stuff. Thanks bud, always appreciate donations.

Of course, I would kill Nazeem for that Cloud District crap but I like having NPCs around no matter how annoying they are... 




 And meanwhile that Dragonborn of mine is occupied with building a house. Vampire Lord at large? Fuck that, I gotta expand my main hall. 




 Done. Gotta say though, the other one about gamer psychology didn't seem like it was applicable to me since I don't play TES Online. Anyway I hope my participation helps. Best of luck to your study! 




 "Bloody good payment! Now go, and please your husband like never before!" 




 Nice! I got a cookbook by authors of the Inn at the Crossroad for GoT food. I'm still biding my time to get appropriate ingredients. I'm living in Asia right now and some of the herbs are hard to get here :( 




 I was expecting to see a Garfield mod haha 




 "From now on, you'll be called WIGGLES!"

Also you have an awesome sister. 




 Thank you so much for posting links to the recipes. Saved! 




 Isn't cultural appropriation stealing from other cultures and presenting them as though they're your own? In most cases I've seen accused of cultural appropriation OPs were just appreciating what they learned from other cultures. I'm all for cultural diversity and appropriate respect but people get so sensitive sometimes. And I'm a non-white person always subconsciously on the lookout for subtle racism!  




 What are petals made of? They look so perfect! 




 It's very hard to capture it but I LOVE when I see a cat smile like that in excitement! S/he's very pretty 3 




 Yeah the books had it worse for Robb... And you spend more time reading the books getting to know the character so I suppose it adds to the pain :( 




 It's funny how his death felt even more tragic than Robb's in some way... 




 Great story and awesome music. But I wish the game mechanics were a bit better... 




 I LOVE THE LOGIN THEME... 




 He's the type of person that's really sexy but there's something about him that neutralizes it a bit. I feel like I would actually enjoy hanging out with him. But I've also heard from a reliable source that he knows nothing so conversation-wise he might not be that fun. 




 That's a fitness regime I can actually follow! 




 While I find Kit gorgeous myself, I agree with you on Tormund. Hot damn. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T FOOK A BERR 




 I guess that's yours now. 




 My first choices are already up here so I'll add some of the lesser ones, probably corny.

"Become Vengeance, David. Become... wrath." Se7en

"They say evil prevails when good men fail to act. What they ought to say is, evil prevails." Lord of War

 




 I love how the hobbits are the first to follow. 

Similarly I love "you bow to no one". Makes me tear up. 




 I was surprised that some people found it cheesy. I loved that dialogue. people always say "hey nothing personal, no hard feelings right" It was personal to me you dick. 




 I love the fox photo that you linked but I love [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/206395673/sand-dunes-photo-with-beach-grass-and?ref=shop_home_feat_1) so much... I can just see this in a haute living magazine! 




 I seriously need the Angry Dome from time to time... 




 Now you've given me an evil idea and my cat will hate you for it XD 




 Awesome in general, but "antivirus in the darkness" part got to me especially. Well done. 




 This photo makes me d'aww and sad at the same time. I wish I could be at ease around my dad like these cubs. 

He spent most of his time working when I was little and I had little time to get to know him. He was always the Patriarch, Mr. Big-shot at his office, that I respected and feared at the same time. Now that he's retired he gets really hissy when he wants to assert his dominance. His chauvinism annoys me but also makes me sad to see him desperately cling onto his faded glory.

Curious a photograph of a lion and his cubs should bring complicated emotions... 




 I love your interpretation of the photo. 




 Yup, I made sure I carried those after getting quite a scare once. As for shrines, I haven't come across a lot of shrines outside towns and "official" shrines. And thanks for the recipe! It's crazy but I don't think I've discovered that despite all the time I spent mixing stuff together :p I still have so many properties to learn about ingredients... 




 Jeff, uh, finds a way... 




 I adored this dress. But at the same time I worried about the train (is that what it's called? the part that trails behind her) getting dirty. 




 That is a very interesting take on the game play. I've read people favouring walking over fast-traveling to be immersed in the environment and atmosphere (with which I wholeheartedly agree) but I never thought about the prospect of vampirism and whatnot. I don't think I have the metaphorical balls for it yet but it sounds like something I should try out later on. 




 That is some find looking dude. Looks like a true Dragonborn in the sense that he is of the Reptilian descent! 




 Gaargghh now that I've seen your achievement I must CATCH THEM ALL :D I'm level 40-something but I waste time making potions that I probably don't use, catching butterflies... Serana is probably waiting for me day and night wondering where I am. I should really get behind getting all the dragon priest masks and claws... 




 Stones of Barenziah Quest Markers

http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9385

It is also in the Steam workshop, one of the most most subscribed mods. 




 Oh yeah, I remember the Vegas part. Too bad he left... He tied everything together. 




 That is so pretty! Congratulations. I have quite a bit to go myself. The silver one reminds me of death masks from the first Resident Evil installment. 




 Agree completely. He's someone I'd find obnoxious and extremely rude in real life (like many fictional characters) but is hilarious on screen. I also don't like how they casually wrote him off saying he left the country with the girl who had a baby for another job or something. 




 You made me tear up a little at the bus stop. It's not the films or the company itself that makes Disney special. It's people like you. Thanks for making a dream come true for the girl and her family. 




 I've watched too many GoT episodes recently; I thought he was gonna say "stop trying to kill everyone". 




 Add me to the group of people waiting for photos of your rats! I would love to see them :D 




 I totally read the title as Cat and thought you named him (her?) ironically. This is when I realize I'm a total cat person XD You have an adorable little rat. Did the little guy finish it all in one seating? 




 Someone turn this into a webcomic... It would make a lovely series. 




 To me, Hiddleston is a guy that you bring to meet your parents. Kit is a guy that you would invite to a threesome with Tom. 




 3

Call me crazy but I see some resemblance between Kit Harrington and Markiplier. Makes me enjoy his LPs even more. 




 "Here lies Dragonborn, the Bane of Alduin, slain by a Mudcrab." 




 Shadowmere sure thinks they pose valid threat... That horse always runs off to fight them while I fight stronger enemies. TEAMWORK 




 I've stayed off modding Skyrim to enjoy the vanilla to the fullest first, so I can't tell if you're joking or if this is really a thing. If so then that's awesome! 




 She does! That's adorable. I thought you perhaps meant to make it sound like espoir. 




 Wow. I think it's good enough to be featured in her official cook book. Well done! 




 Why did I click this at lunch hour with no way to get sushi... I imagine my first attempt won't be nearly as neat as yours. Rice everywhere! 




 I envy you but at the same time worry that it might cause considerable shoulder pain... Maybe not that heavy a guy? :p 




 Aww that's too bad. But thanks for letting me know all the same. 




 Yeah, I really like the striking b/w. If you can scan it and photoshop colour it maybe? Anyways I hope to see more of your work in the future :) 




 I absolutely love the DB hoodie! Wonder they shIP internationally? 




 Agreed. It's more fun, I get to try out / practice champs I don't usually play, etc. I don't get emotionally invested in these games either. 




 I was like "please don't be League, please don't be League... SONNABABITCH" 

The funny thing is though, it wasn't like he was flaming people for allegedly costing him a game like usual trolls do. It's a freakin' friends request to a stranger he's never met... Goddamn. This kid has real issues. I'm even more embarrassed by the fact that he's from my province :( 




 I had to stare to make sure if it wasn't just optical illusion. He looks healthy otherwise! Get ready to be ruled over by this little cutie, OP! :D And do keep us posted! I would love to see his progress pics as he grows. 




 So unique! It looks great as it is, but do you plan to colour it by any chance? Missandei in particular looks like she'll look even more beautiful with some vibrant colours.

By the way when I read the title I was like "NOO Missandei wouldn't steal Dany's man!" XD 




 Welcome, neighbour! High five from Canada :D 




 Yup. I think the most important thing is a sense of drive and perseverance to follow that. /edit: typo 




 [Higher Resolution](http://i.imgur.com/Tenl0wD.jpg) for the extra goodness 




 It's inspiring to see people that make relationships work through patience and hard work. Kudos to both of them! 




 As someone living in Korea I can guaran-fucking-tee that she eventually did. 




 Never thought I would say this but that's adorable. Congratulations on having an awesome relationship! I really love how you two feel totally comfortable with each other to have this kind of thing.

And I don't think you guys are unfit to be parents if you ever change your mind about having kids. 




 [Just in case the joke is lost...](https://youtu.be/mv3ScKLD1Vc?list=PLLoWhJJEjzXl0jfiQjuVuJkVe0gGpYstU) 




 I can just feel how safe and comfortable she is around you. Thank you for providing her with a great home! I really love the picture of her with her big bro and sis. I wish my cat could have siblings... ;_; 
























 You have an impressive collection of reaction gifs! 




 That is absolutely amazing. I hope things are going better for you. 




 I didn't see it when I watched the episode the first time, but the second time around I saw Stannis's men in the back running away from the battle even before it began. :(

But can Winterfell accommodate that large an army? 2000+. Damn. 




 I'm actually not looking forward to the Jorah   Daario road trip.

"So Daario, what you've been up to?"

"Oh the usual... boozing, gambling, and bedding the queen that you love so much."

But I do want to see more of Varys and Tyrion trying to run Mereene! 




 I'm glad. I'm not very fond of licorice. Can't believe they're individually airbrushed. Your friend is really talented! 




 Same here! It's a strange feeling. I think it's mainly because he acted with *some* principle prior to these horrendous events. Ramsay has no redeemable characteristics. 




 Still I'm glad I got to see a bit of everything before the season ended. 




 Explains the resemblance between white walkers and draugrs! 




 They're gorgeous! What did the Targaryen cupcake taste like though? Licorice? 




 Hmm didn't think of it that way. Still she managed to convey a mixture of emotions that Cersei must have felt during the walk. 




  he did but she doesn't know that

She explicitly asked whether he murdered Renly with blood magic and he said yes. I want to believe Brienne spared Stannis for whatever reason but my hopes have been in vain for this series. 




 That looks awesome! Do you plan to do make something else before S6 starts? It would be great for the GoT-hungry audience :3 




 I want to believe, but I find it incredibly difficult to believe Brienne --above all people-- would feel compelled to show mercy to Stannis just because the Boltons defeated him. Her entire character is based on keeping oaths and avenging Renly was on the top of her list...

If nothing else Brienne would give Stannis a clean death. I doubt the Boltons would allow Stannis to have that kind of dignity. 




 I'm more and more inclined to side with the White Walkers. Most of the characters I care for are gone, so come all, come all, freeze the whole fuckin' world. 




 Same here. Seriously if she was gonna give someone a suspiciously long kiss why not attempt to murder Jaime? I really liked Ellaria in S4 but in S5 she's so obnoxious just like her daughters. She must've looked cool because of the Oberyn buff. 




 I'm surprised you had respect for them in general. Of course I had immense respect for Mormont and Aemon (and some for Alliser during the big battle) but most of them were thieves, killers, and rapists that were just there because they had no other choice. They didn't strike me as an honourable sort... Jon had good friends but they're all gone... :( 




 I never thought I would agree with the statement "kill the boy". 




 I was feeling bad for her until the "new guy" picked her up and I saw a burning vengeful spirit gleam in her eyes. 

But seriously though, I always knew Lena Headey was good but goddamn. She just raised the bar. I hope no one follows her around on the street with a bell and uttering "shame". 




 Boring Fangorn sequence confirmed 




 What business does a Targaryen have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly! 




 Aww she looks so down :( "Why are you doing this to me."

But OP, she is ONE of the cutest cats :D You should have more pride in your Baby 3 




 "Don't mistake my fluffy goodness as a sign of weakness!" 




 So pretty... And she looks so happy too! 




 This is awesome. thank you! 




 That's one fierce mofo. He reminds me of Rengar! 




 "Nothing." 




 Aww. Mine either, but I can't blame them. I wouldn't be fond of clothes if I had perfect fur like them! Only if they could go easy on shedding... 




 So photogenic! S/he is beautiful. 




 Awww. Cats seem to be one of the most judgmental species out there but I can't help but keep loving them. My cat looks at me kind of like that when my hand lingers around his whiskers too long. 




 I don't know why, but her expression is very noir. She would look great with a detective getup. 




 Awww s/he is gorgeous! Maine coon? 




 No more frozen chicken for dinner! 




 They finally gave Anivia a new portrait. SO HAPPY 




 Whiterun sides with the imperials actually. 




 Given the main ingredient I can't say I'm surprised. 




 Futurama reference. 




 Well I surveyed some odd 200 people and the results show 2/3 of the participants chose the imperials over stormcloaks. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/351gpp/poll_the_empire_or_the_stormcloaks_did_you_kill/.compact (sorry on mobile)

It's hard to say which path is particularly rare in playing Skyrim since there are so many choices. Skyrim doesn't have the infamy system either so you have so much freedom! 




 Agreed, and wasn't he also a teenager? Or was he in his early 20s already? If still in teens we're talking about a teenaged heir to the throne who was chased out of his castle and had to live as a glorified beggar for a number of years... Even when I consider the whole "teenagers in the medieval times = adults" concept I can't help but be sympathetic about his downfall. 




 "Jorah Mormont, who crawled through a friend zone and came out with Greyscale on the other side." 




 Whoa this is some cool stuff. I'll try some of these out when I start a new character. I'm a bit partial to being human for now :p

I'm preparing a new mage character and spamming muffle for illusion skill ups is a good tip to know!  




 I would recommend NOT using mods until you get absolutely tired of the game. I finished vanilla Skyrim first (the main dragonborn / imperial legion / dark brotherhood / thieves guild quests) before buying DLCs and installing mods, meaning I went through 100+ hours before adding tons of more fun. I opted out of the Companion quest because I didn't want to become a werewolf... yet. 




 "*Haha* That's for damned sure... AWOO AWOO!" 




 That's awful. It's funny and tragic at the same time how one click can be so devastating. I hope your next run is more fun than the last. You could avoid certain quests for better items and whatnot. 




 I forget whether she was actually in need of help or one of the bandits... *You picked the wrong place to get lost!* 




 They remind me of pygmies in Diablo II. Sound like them too! I remember seeing them hypnotized by one of those enchanted water/fire/etc. pillars. They didn't attack; they stood around and talked back to me in gibberish when I E'd them.  




 Yup, I escaped with Ralof but ended up fighting alongside Hadvar. I had a weird glitch after the Battle of Windhelm where Hadvar wouldn't stop following me with his sword (as a friendly NPC). 




 Looks so cozy! Humanoids look cool too, but I love how Skyrim can make reptilians and felines look incredible... not to mention charming voices! 




 General Tullius likes this. 




 Nixon spotted! 




 I wanted to see Frozen but I don't think I ever will now that everyone has gone and ruined it for me with the incessant Let it Go and Do you wanna build a snowman bullshit. 




 Running gag about Conway twitty too. They stopped now but it was so annoying. I wish Seth McFarlane would make better use of his amazing voice talent. I enjoy FG but it could be way better. 




 Could be the sewer leading to the Black Briar Meadery. It's an optional task and I found it after slaughtering all the mercenaries. ... I'm not a subtle person. 




 Follow the white dragon 




 Aww too bad they were a temporary thing. I guess the next best thing would be to print out a label and stick it on Sprite or something. 




 lol Good one! I was actually expecting him to say "well you did flash your butt to me" or something like that in justification.  




 I was so looking forward to this. Love the Drogon part in particular, naturally. xD 




 Ohh I didn't even see that! I do a marathon before a new season begins but it seems I always miss out on something. --Edit: oops, should read more carefully. Earlier this season. 




 Yeah I keep forgetting that. I just remember how people look down upon him, ridiculing his background and whatnot! 




 Probably why I find furbies so terrifying! 




 The part where he drained life/skin from people terrified little me to death... Mummy 2 on the other hand was much more entertaining!

Edit: forgot to say "people". 




 Joking aside, I thought he just had one made, like asked someone to do it for him. But then again does Ser Davos have subordinates? I'm not too sure myself. 




 Easily one of my favourite scenes. Another one is when Django picks out his very first outfit. 




 That would make a great pilot for some show. 




 I agree. Totally infuriating. The last time it happened I tried to understand (heavily outnumbered... even then it doesn't make sense though) and now it's getting ridiculous. What happened to the totally bad-ass mofos that set the precedent for "Kill the Masters"? 




 "all around douche canoe" has a nice ring to it. 




 Delish! Also we found where all the potatoes have gone... 




 I didn't think he was. He was just a perfectly normal human being. I thought what made Forrest excel in the army was his "stupid" adherence to every instruction given to him, even to a degree that would be too demanding for most people. 




 Let's get that tax exempt status! 




 Tearing up here. I too had the incredible luck of having teachers who believed in me and encouraged me to reach beyond what I thought was my limit. Thank you so much for being that person to that young lady. She'll remember you and be grateful for the rest of her life, as will her parents and friends. 




 I don't think it's petty. I enjoy good vengeance. 

But Seriously I don't get these cheaters who beg after being caught. What the hell did they think would happen? Why cheat to begin with? :s 




 Not only you gave the bitch a creative surprise party you did the right thing by deleting the photo. I hope you met someone who really deserves your affection. 




 You may get some stares when you go out but it'll be because they're in awe. It's hard to rock this kind of hairstyle but you're doing it. I really like the "zen pineapple" shot. 




 He came back from King's Landing in one piece. I'm very happy. 




 I get where you're coming from but I don't think tough love is the way to go about this kind of thing. Especially talking about how there are a lot of people who have more serious issues... it makes the depressed more miserable. 




 Please talk to me. I don't care what it's about. Pm me if that's more appropriate. Please please talk to me. 




 *judge 




 "You so fat you gonna stay all around room!" 




 It's the World Cup all over again... 




 That's harsh. How can he not fall in love with me? I stole his heart... 




 I didn't really like the Thieves Guild myself unfortunately. I liked the one in Oblivion better. I wish I had more quests to get to know other guild members. Like Sapphire. WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR REAL NAME 




 Awww. Can I see Snickers as well? :3 




 It's like that dude in Solstheim who wanted to fly. :( 




 I didn't trust myself so I always saved whenever I had to cross this bridge. I guess the dead don't care about safety but this doesn't bode well for tourists like us! 




 So enthusiastic! Any story behind the name Doodle? 




 Toasted toasted toasted my god she is beautiful... 




 Great Hermes's dreadlocks! This is awesome. 




 Normally yes. But I'm not a big fan of golden shower myself. 




 I used to like him and then he turned out to be a cheating bastard with sex kinks... Unfortunate. 




 "SO DO YOU" 




 "And we'll paint a happy little lobster right here...  




 She's adorable! I see so many cute, original names on /r/cats. I thought I gave some more thoughts into naming my first cat. 




 This is how it starts... Beware the Cat Hoarding Syndrome! ... I jest, of course. The two look so happy together! I just kind of want to squeeze in between the two so I can feel their fluffy goodness 3 Congrats on getting your first cats. May your black clothes be filled with fur. 




 The German Vulddd 




 "omg Jon, you can't ask people why they're white walkers." 




 I love how you two are on the same step, holding up the right foot! 




 I love when their ears express their feelings. "I disapprove. I disapprove greatly, human!" 




 His pose is relaxed but his expression seems to say "Son... we need to have a talk. Take a seat right there." 




 I love that name! Sugar Bear 3 As pretty as s/he looks. 




 I vote for Tris as well! 




 That's one Teemo that will NOT ruin your game! -- unless of course, he chases after your cursor on screen. 




 Hazelnut's anti-aging secret! Dermatologists hate her!

Seriously that's some timeless beauty right there. 3 




 Congratulations!!! I hope the job treats you well. Best of luck! 




 Did someone pour Jello into the water? 
























 She won't ever let Charles be King for the good of the realm! 




 I absolutely abhor people who cheat on their spouses but I just can't bring myself to hate Arnold. Also the fact that he admitted to his fault in a relatively recent AMA made me admire him more. 




 My thoughts too! I know he's paid to look good but goddamn only few people can look so sexy around the age 50. 




 Yeah, I get so sad when I see my 90s heroes grow old... I'm just glad he's still taking care of himself and looks as good as he does now. 




 This was my thought exactly. I love her current portrait and skins a lot and I don't even play Fiora. The clothes look much brighter and it doesn't really seem to suit her all that much :( 




 He looks awesome and I can't wait to try him out, but I'll miss the old one that seemed to be more lighthearted.  




 Reminds me of [David Kawena's Kocoum](https://www.facebook.com/david.kawena/photos/a.207734582589507.58487.171173612912271/300433536652944/?type=3 permPage=1) 3 *slightly NSFW 




 The conversation they should have with the other dogs in the animal heaven must be pretty awkward. "So hey, haha, no hard feelings, right guys?" 




 It's very weird isn't it? I feel more comfortable talking about my depression to people I don't know that well rather than my close friends and family. It's almost like they can't believe I'm depressed. My mom always tried to have me quit taking meds but she saw how much it helped me function after I forgot to pick up a prescription for the week and broke down completely.

Since you've just opened up to them, they must be getting used to the fact now. Give them some time, and perhaps they'll come around and see how much this is affecting you and that you need them by your side.

In the mean time you can always talk to us! :) 




 I pulled myself up from feeling like that all the time, but there was one friend that really made me feel inferior. She was pretty, kind, all around "people person". She also comes from a well-off family so she would casually buy designer goods that she clearly did not pay for. I felt bad whenever I felt jealous because she was a genuinely nice person, and it's not her fault that her parents are liberal with their money.

Anyways we went from being best friends to just acquaintances and then I stopped talking to her all together because she reminded me of all things that I couldn't have. What I had could be acquired through effort; what she had was just innate. I couldn't work towards that.

I actually admitted to this via email and explained to her how I felt, how sorry I was that I just stopped talking to her even though she was always very nice. She appreciated it and revealed to me that she was jealous of my academic success (what little there was anyway) and her parents would always compare her to me. That exactly didn't make me feel better but at least let me see she wasn't living the perfect life I thought she had.

I'm still envious of people who are beautiful and sociable but I try to remind myself not all of us can be like that. It's difficult to stick to this, but I try. 




 Hmm, from what I've experienced and heard from my physician the clinically depressed can't really function well the entire day. You know one of those bad days you get? That goes on to become a week, month, year, etc.

You are still young and I'm glad to hear apart from acute episodes of feeling low you can go about your day most of the time. Keep it up! I wouldn't say you are clinically depressed just yet. But do consult a doctor if the episodes last longer or become more frequent.

Also I should mention that it's very natural to feel that way during that phase of your life. Talk to your friends, or us (we'll always be here!) whenever you're feeling low. You don't have to talk about how you feel, what happened, if you don't want to. Sometimes it's nice to just talk, y'know?

Anyways these are my two cents. Hope this provided some insight. 




 I'm so sorry your parents didn't respond well. I feel most of the times that is the case :( I guess it's hard for especially parents to just accept that their children are having this type of difficulty, because they might think there were at fault for their children's depression (which might be true in some cases).

I hope she eventually comes to see that just acknowledging that you are going through this can provide some solace.  




 I'm always divided about that. Is it "I see wiener" or "Icy wiener"? I simply must know! 




 Also the drink. Was it called popo? *drool a la Homer* 




 I would have the whole set Mia has. It looks awesome. 




 Wammy wam wam wozzle! 




 "FIRMLY GRASP IT" 




 And I love how he sometimes puts together a pretty complex and eloquent sentence and proceeds to do something stupid immediately. 




 Yum! I think they'll look even better with more lighting. 




 "Come on, Garcia, slap ass!" 




 Kudos. I've felt similar pressure when I was your age. Am a girl so no one was hazing me for not banging a random dude, but I felt like I needed it for social validation. Silly, I know, but I was young.

I'm so glad my first time wasn't some mistake because when it happened with the right guy I had no regrets and it was wonderful. I'm sure this is the same for guys as well. You want the type of first time that makes you smile when you look back on it, not cringe or facepalm haha.

Good on you for sticking to your principle. 




 Could you tell me more about your fish? No one I know keeps a pet fish so I have no idea what it's like. Probably the only thing I know about taking care of a fish is that it requires a lot more water than people think. (Like, pet shops advertise that gold fish can be kept in a wine glass but they actually need a big ass aquarium.) Care to tell me about it? 




 Eloquently put. I guess it goes both ways; I can't understand why they feel so persecuted (oh the irony) for their belief, why they think they're being attacked. I spent my adolescence in a catholic high school and we accepted pretty much all kinds of sexual orientation. People would openly come out and no one, including the pastor, would try to change it. I wish I could let them see it's not a compromise that would break down their whole belief system. 




 I got giddy just reading your post. I really miss that kind of feeling. Congratulations!  




 I agree. People could use this sub for venting about this whole situation too. 




 Good job, and savour it! I don't think I was that good around level 18. Keep it going! 




 Someone should have put a leash on THAT guy. He must be going through eternal puberty.

But you did the right thing not fighting him, I think. Someone that obtuse wouldn't try to understand regardless of whether sense is taught to him by words or force. 




 lol I'm not sure why he's playing hooky, but I've actually seen him inside Belethor sweeping the floor. He kept telling me he was too busy to talk to me :( 




 Welcome, new Dovahkiin! Since you're new to the game I also assume you're also new to the parodies [like](https://youtu.be/ZPllpzxmM5k) [these](https://youtu.be/mv3ScKLD1Vc?list=PLLoWhJJEjzXl0jfiQjuVuJkVe0gGpYstU). Enjoy. 




 I've tried it so many times with kettles, but the merchants move around right after I put it over their head and the kettle falls off :( I must be doing something wrong. 




 It's amazing how just three words "stop right there" can make me read the entire sentence in the Imperial Guard voice. 




 Yep, this is why I chose my hireling solely based on whether I liked their voice or not. I ended up hiring Marcurio and marrying him. 




 I learned about this only after I chose to kill him. He was a traitor in my eyes so I don't exactly regret it, but it looks like he would've been pretty handy in some quests! 




 Glad to know I'm not the only one. Another disappointing moment would be cracking into a master lock chest and finding scrolls that are too expensive to be sold to any of the merchants. 




 lol beautiful. I love how Bender's expression is like "you about done?" 




 I remember this street! I remember they had a transgender theme going on when I visited the place for the weekend trip.

Do they celebrate the Independence Day for the US? I'd like to think this is something special between us Canadians and Brits :3 




 That is absolutely incredible. So well drawn!

I know Natalie Dormer is a bit old to be Margaery but I think she's been spot-on for the role this whole series. I've loved her since the Tudors! She's one of the actresses that are hot enough to make me question my heterosexuality. 




 Sure is, he gave her a good tumble. 




 Mr. Peppy wouldn't hurt anybody! HE'S VEGETARIAN ;-; 




 I'm not saying you should hate him. Just a hypothesis on why some may dislike him. Personally I think he's a great guy, just not a big fan of his recent vids. 




 "FREE HAT FREE HAT" 




 Nah I can see where you're coming from. There are some games that are fun to watch other people play, mainly horror games. Probably because I'm too much of a wuss to play it myself xD

Other games like Hearthstone, I don't really get the appeal of watching LPs. Northernlion's Binding of Isaac / Spelunky videos are exceptions though. His soothing voice is charming. 




 Ditto. This is also why I can't be too harsh on Pewdiepie. I don't like his videos but he's done some good work with his popularity. 




 I think it's his fans (some of them anyway) that fueled antipathy. Going to other people's videos and saying pewds did this first, or "like this comment if pewds brought you here" kind of thing. I'm sure fans of other youtubers do this too, but Pewdiepie has the most subscribers so they're bound to stand out. 




 I respect other peoples' preference for LPers (I don't enjoy Pewdiepie's videos, for instance) but for me what sets apart Markiplier from other "screaming" youtubers is that he makes commentary while yelling. Sure, he gets super dramatic at times to the point where it gets annoying but he does provide some perspective on the gameplay. 




 "Fo-er my suppa, I er, uh, want a party plattaa" 




 Is this your girl/boy? So beautiful 3 I love the heart-ish shape on the chest! 




 "Hey, I know who you are!" 




 I'm assuming "cure disease" potions work for all maladies but yeah, the lack of toilet paper is definitely disconcerting. Also the lack of wi-fi.

I guess I'll just try to have fun slaughtering dragons and giants... :/ 




 BB was the first TV show to make me really hate the protagonist in the end because of his relentless justification. such a good series. 




 Lanaaaaaaaaaaa 




 "Omg please chase me down with your dogs"

Yeah he's gonna bitch slap me with a restraining order. 




 I imagined these popping up as the Sims achievement haha 




 Well that's not a nice thing to say to someone who seems happy with his/her decision. 




 For me usually

Athenes - dealing with high ap nuker (LB, Syndra, etc.)

Morello - dealing with ap tanks (namely Swain) + when you need extra CDR but rather get mpen boots. 




 I should stop investing so much in kitty beds and sofas... This is pretty much all cats need.

Also she would make a great submission to /r/photoshopbattles. 




 I... like Meth! *hehehehe* I... like Meth! *hehehehe* 




 You just doomed that guy! RIP his social life. /s

Thanks for being a cool dude to the newbie. I remember when I started out I was really nervous about playing with other people because I lacked confidence. 




 Something tells me you are also a fine archer. 




 LotR + TES? Yes please. Well done. 




 This made me smile. I'm not OP, but thank you. 




 I should despise Roose Bolton to the death but because it was portrayed by [Michael McElhatton](http://pre10.deviantart.net/402d/th/pre/i/2015/099/9/0/michael_mcelhatton__got_premiere__by_valeria122-d8p40xc.jpg) I found it a teensy bit difficult. He looks like a very well-aged Daniel Craig. (I love both of them.) He might not fit GRRM's description of Roose Bolton's appearance in the books to the last detail, but his voice is perfect. 




 I've found that a lot of League fan artists are fond of Draven! You really captured his persona well. Zed is a bit more psycho than I would like him to be but that's one of the reasons that make this illustration so great. Hope to see more of you! 




 I love how the typeface matches that in the game! Really gives it an authentic feel. 




 If Younger Robert, then for sure! 




 lol my nerdiness peaked and I checked Infosphere. According to [the transcript](http://theinfosphere.org/Transcript:The_Honking), it was indeed in singular. I'll leave my persistence here now :p 




 Op, you may have to get your oven checked. One is toasted only on one side and the other is burnt! 




 Me too. Does he say Eagle Eye"s"? To my recollection he just said eagle eye. 




 Also looks incredibly wise. I would like to get some life advice from this dog. 




 To be fair, I love South Park and agree with a lot of its messages. Even in that episode the actual conclusion wasn't so TRP. :/ 




 Irish me up anytime cap'n. 




 Delish! Diamond ProX is another fine looking young man but not an exemplary sportsman unfortunately. :( 




 Seems shopped, but I agree he looks dapper as fuck in vests. 




 "How come we're not ascending? ... Oh, right, the sins..." 




 3 I melt. I hope they are adopted together!  




 Incoming belly rubrubs followed by swift retaliation :p RIP white clothes. Mine on the other hand sheds white fur like crazy which complements my black clothes quite well... 




  All men pay for sex.

I start reading this sentence and those following it in Butters's voice in the Bottom Bitch episode. "He has to listen to her motherfucking problems because she kisses him!" 




 I doubt OP in the thread would see this, but I've dated guys who were shorter than me and in those cases there were always a turning point for me. At first I was just good friends with them and then I suddenly started seeing them as bf material. One was a romantic poet sort of guy, and the other protected me from a stalker. That kind of turning points.

I hope girls eventually give this a guy a chance. You never know how things will turn out. 




 lol yeah. And I love how he just said "wat" after the Darq copypasta. Pure definition of dumbfounded. 




 No. everywhere else in the world those are known as Middle Eastern countries you guys are calling them Asian to be politically correct and ultra sensitive.

I didn't realize calling them Asian would be deemed an act of political correctness.

Also it took me too long to look up and see that this was a TRP thread. I shouldn't have tried to understand. 




 My Reddit level is way too low. I recognized only two or so. 




 He reminds me of Pewdiepie. In a good way! 




 This is a great rule to live by. Thank you!  




 Too bad a person's talent is not a measure of his/her character. I like Mel Gibson's movies too. 




 LOL I was caught up on that too. I wish my school offered that kind of class when I was younger. Seems like a sweet course. 




 He also reminds me of Jack Gleeson, who was pretty much hazed by every person he came in contact with in public. I guess in his case it just showed how terrific he was at acting the part of Joffrey but I can see that tearing him down until he became sick and tired of being recognized everywhere. It's funny how some people want to act for glamour and others just want to act and be left alone otherwise.  




 You're not alone. It may not be a fitting installment of a series loved and revered by many, but the movie itself was okay. Of course there's always a chance that I may have fangirl'd too much over the presence of Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. 




 I love her mom (dad?) is like "not this again". xD She's adorable. 




 Better yet, have them draft a contract for future uses. "Every other Saturday shall be a Family Saturday and Party B shall comply with whatever Party A deems appropriate"! 




 Same here. I think we are the lucky few. Did they put you to sleep by any chance? I was asleep the whole time and just felt general numbness when I woke up. A couple of Tyrenols later I was 4 wisdom teeth and pain free.

My friends who had local anesthesia on the other hand weren't so lucky :( 




 Drama within drama, a [student](https://np.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/39vqnk/dentists_of_reddit_are_you_happy/cs76eeb) of the discipline challenges the currence practice. 




 Oh yeah, I guess you could look at it that way too. With so many FPH lurkers around I'm prone to assume pics like this were posted with sinister intention... 




 Uggh I see. Thank you. I got my wisdom teeth pulled out and I couldn't be happier with the result. Sure it was expensive, but I'd had to go through months of pain beforehand and felt so free when they were out. I can't imagine why anyone would be this so stupid and childish over something like this.  




 What is "TRP lingo" that the other commenter was talking about? I tried browsing through TRP once and I just couldn't finish reading one thread... 




 I'm glad FPHers are getting some of the wittiest insults I've seen, but I resent the fact that this photo was posted to /r/funny. :( At first I thought the title might have been totally unrelated (maybe because of her expression) but noooo it had to be about her having a heavy bf. Yeah that's REALLY funny. /s 




 GoT reference. 




 Nothing. 




 It's unrelated to the drama itself but wow Chris Pratt married Anna Faris? That's awesome! I don't know why exactly but I really like her. They should make a really fun couple to hang out with. 




 that looks amazing. I love cheesecake that use Oreo crumbs for the crust part and this has a whole Oreo on top! Your brother is very lucky. 




 I don't think he makes for a better Daario (I wanted him to be more exotic) but this guy is gorgeous as hell. 




 Aww that is just adorable... I am a cat person but I'm so envious of people who live with dogs whenever I see something like this. 




 I love how you reply with a disapproving face every single time. I like you. 




 I'm going to start doing this... only with a real bell! 




 Aww. Did the original one from the show have bubbles as well? I only remember the pipe...
