 emm I'll have a look :) please post here to get the community going :) thanks for the interest, I'll look for the seeds now. PC/XBLA? 




 Whoever said that looks like a penis has a pretty fucked up pair of balls 




 Hey r/minecraft, 
I recently made a new sub for players and fans of Survival Island. There you can post seeds/stories/links and posts related to the Survival Island style of playing Minecraft. You can also post sets of Goals/Objectives to be completed in game.

It's only a new sub, So it will need admins/moderators, but most of all it needs a community, There isn't much on it now, but hopefully we can kick it off soon, So any Survival Island fans on r/Minecraft, Let's get this community off the ground 3

www.reddit.com/r/survivalisland 




 awesome! 




 1. Build a minecart rail
2. Craft TNT
3. Construct a watch tower at least 15 blocks high

5. Build a fireplace using netherrack and brick. (stone/clay)
5. Create a full set of iron armor.
6. Build a tree house :D
7. Start a farm, 6 plants minimum.
8. Craft Red wool, Blue wool and Orange Wool
9. Enchant a chestplate

Feel free to play on hardcore ;)

 So uh...I see your "report" succeeded... :) 




 whatever, It's only a post :) 




 haha how? 



















 This has more than likely been brought up before, but I would really like to see different colored beds in the the game, Eg. The normal bed recipe with green wool = bed with green sheets. They recently did something similar, different color planks of wood. I think it would be a nice feature in the game.

 Fair point, and I fully respect your opinion, but I mean 2 million is a huge number of subs, surely they're doing something right

 that's a brilliant strategy :) I will try that myself :) 




 No problem :) 




 Ah but the bed is featured, indicating that this relativity map is of at least Beta 1.3 




 Night is on its way, but do you dig down and sleep off the night in a dingy 3x3 dirt hole, or do you dash to a village and sleep safe inside the warm walls of a house?

 Precisely ;)

 Yes, unfortunately :'( 




 I fucking love you guys hahahaha 




 I agree 




 Hmmm, I can't remember the original source as I've had this image for about a month, But I would recommend a Google Image search for 'minecraft relativity diagram'. I will have a look around for you and link one to you if I find a bigger version ::) 




 Knew you guys would love it ;)

 Personally, the posts on this sub intrigue me, but are they some people out there, maybe even on this sub, that get off on this stuff? 




 Maybe it's because I'm not a gun-crazed American, but I don't get how this is on the front page

 I live in Ireland and looking for a low maintenance spider thats easy to handle and is calm. Average room temperature around here is 21ยบ celsius which I think is around 60/70 F. I dont want to splash out the cash on a heater as I just want a low maintenance spider. What would be a good suggestion for an absolute beginner? And should I raise from a spiderling? 




 Never heard of them 




  I have been handling spiders I find for a while and havent been bitten. As far as I know they're so small the bite is painless and not noticeable 




 Thanks,  great answer. Georgina it is! 




 Answer: Quite simply, There are no big insects on the Emerald Isle! 




 How do you differentiate between male and female spiders?

 Could be a recluse, That shit is dangerous 




 Its ok, the NSA will remember for us. 




 Nah, she looks about 16 to me 




 I agree great story, That's what the spirit of a spiderbro is all about!  




 Great answer, this really cleared it up. 




 From hearing all these heartwarming fables and tales of arachnid loyalty and bravery, I really want a spiderbro. Thing is where I live, Ireland, there isn't any big guys out in the wild. The biggest wild spiders you get here have a body the size of a large pea, and that's no exaggeration. I had a spiderbro once when I was young, Unnamed but valiant and the time has come where I want a watchful guardian, who protects me from the pesky flies of irish summer, a spiderbro like Viktor, or Gustav, a brave companion to stand tall for the summer months, but all the big busters (pea bodies) are nowhere to be seen. Anyone know how to attract a house/bath spider? (Bath spider is what I've always called them, as they always climb up the drains and chill) This would be a big help as I'm allegeric to most insect repellents, which is ironic. Thanks guys. 




 Oh my god this is so beautiful :') RIP Spiderbro 




 Most of you guys here own an arachnid so I'd just like to know why I see a lot of dead spiders on their backs with their legs curled in. 




 I kept watching this when I realised it looks like there's a dick on his shirt 




 'A metric shit-ton' is my new favourite phrase 




 Ironic how the god of floods is found submerged for over 1000 years... 




 Anyone see the little face with the orange lights and grill before anything else? 




 It's just like modern art, ugly, beautiful,  all depends on the eye. Personally, I like it. 




 I particularly liked the skulls 




 I've seen enough Final Destination movoes to see where this is going... 




 Nice post, poo_smudge 














 Simply block the other accounts when they appear, it will stop them coming up again. You still get all the tweets from your favourite comedy feeds and much less spam.

 Hey bud, I found a seed for 1.2.5 :) It's 2475069397829075708. 
It has only one tree, many resources (diamond) and an easy to find dungeon, and also some sugarcane. Hope this helps. Can you please advertise and support this community so we can find other survival fans like us :) Best of luck with your survival island :)

 Ok well first of all, by the expensive headset on your neck and the fact youre indoors in the dark, I'm going to be bold and assume you're a hardcore gamer. If this is the case (and I could easily be wrong) I'd recommend getting out of the house a lot.
  Go out to malls and observe the other guys there, not in a homosexual way, Look out for their hairstyles and types of clothes theyre wearing. Also might be an idea to look at the attention theyre getting from girls, say do they have a gf with them or is he talking confidently to a female store clerk. If you you fond a certain style or hairstyle that fits,  go for it!
   I would recommend getting active! Maybe you already are, but heading for a run once a week, or playing an intense game or sport with friends for an hour is great for you. You will notice your skin will start to look better and also your body! 
  From the picture you look like a real nice guy and a great, warm friend. But I'd take into account the steps ive given you and try up your rating even by 1 :)
   Also, this entire paragraph is from a guys view, so call this 'bro to bro' advice. 
  Hope all goes well! :)

 All I'm seeing is Finn fucking the shit out of that sword 




 I love how the guy is just there like 'dammit, not this shit again bird' 




 I live in Ireland so trust me heat is not a factor here in winter! 




 A tarantula need only eat a cricket once a week to survive healthily and happily. They can live up to around 3 weeks without food I believe, depending on the activity of the spider. However small spiders can fast longer because their bodies dont need as much fuel. Hope this helps! 




 Must be hard for this little guy to find food, great looking spider. Post this to the guys over at r/tarantulas, They love seeing high-def pictures like this! 




 I'm a big fan of spiders but this really took my breath away

 I have had a few moments like that which I've never told anyone because they'd think I'm insane but here seems like the right place.

I remember when I was about 15 or so thinking out of nowhere about the singer Whitney Houston, only ever heard her name before, never even sprung to my mind. I felt really sick that night and couldn't sleep, At this stage she had compeltely slipped my mind. She was dead in the morning.

The same happened with singer Amy Winehouse. She hadn't made headlines for a few years and randomly popped into my mind. Same again, nervous gut, sickness and she died within 2 days.

I'm not a big believer in spirituality or a spiritual dimension, but I creeped myself out and still remember them years on.

She's incredibly beautiful, and I still think about her a lot even though work is out for summer.

 My next door neighbour was the best Christian in the world, She went to mass every single day. Said the rosary every single night, Always helped the priest and cleaned the church. She did this her whole life until she died of the most painful, slow, excruciating, cancerous death imaginable. When she died she left her sister, also a committed christian to live alone and run the entire farm. 2 months later her dog of 14 years died, and now my living neighbour lives alone all day praying and farming, Loneliness must be unbearable. That's when I realised if there was a God, he had been a total fucking asshole to my neighbours who were sisters. Who were both the most committed christians imaginable. Slowly killed one, and left the other alone to work for 10 years. That's when I came to the conclusion if there was a God, he wouldn't let that happen. And if there actually was a god, He's a total asshole. And that's how religion no longer became part of my life

 Years ago my parents used to leave a six pack for the binmen once a month or so. In return they would leave a company bin bag (worth โฌ5) every bin day so that we didnt have to buy one and the company would still collect our rubbish because it was in their company bag (a requirement if you wanted the company to collect it). We kept it up until somehow their boss found out about it, but it made for a funny story.

 But if you met a guy, and everything about him is perfect, and youre at his place and hear a bark.

Remeber this is the GUY OF YOUR DREAMS here, and he's just dropped the dog bomb, What do you do? 




 Luckily I fall into the 'otherwise' category  




 How many birds do you have? 




 If I was with someone my dog would have to be accepted, but getting the girl was what I was wondering about 




 Oh no that mouth kissing stuff is rotten. Yeah especially if the dog is an indoors amd outdoors dog, The stuff it licks, can't even describe 




 I'm 18 and I'm lucky to have a really good dog in my life; pic here http://imgur.com/TeZvKWQ. I spend a lot of time with her and she's helped me through some hard times. I get a lot of comments such as "*You and your dog must be so close*" "*She's always in your snapchat story*" If you personally met a man and realised you and him were getting along really well, Would you be put off him if he was really close to his dog?

TLDR; I love my dog a lot, Is that unattractive?

 I'm 18 and just finished school. My parents left the house as they do everyday and told me to cycle to the nearest town ( 1 hour bike ride) and put apply for a job in the factory there. If I get it, which I doubt it do, I have to cycle over and back every day. They will be really pissed because they left at 10 AM and now 3 hours later I'm still lying flat on the floor aimlessly staring into a screen with no motivation to do anything. Why would anyone employ me anyway? fuck that. fuck me. 




 This is the greatest thing I have ever seen. 




 Exactly :) 




 When I'd drift off my puppy would be "asleep" in the dog bed beside my bed. I used to wake up with her lying on my chest looking up at me. She sleeps outside now cause she's bigger but she still does it if I lay down outside with her

 And it makes me feel guilty for not being happy when often I have no choice in the matter 




 You're obliged to be happy at Christmas,  nobody wants a depressed shit around the tree. That's what's killed me the most about the last 3 Christmas's. I can't help if I'm sad for fucks sake. Pisces man. 




 Being off school leaves me with too much time to think 




 I finished my last year of school and now all of my long time friends (8 of them) have told me to my face they don't want anything to do with me this summer and cut all ties.

 Unfortunately, I suffer from MDD and decided to cancel upcoming appointments with my Youth Therapist, scheduled during summer, because now that school is finished and exams are done, I presumed I would feel an awful lot less stressed.

My girlfiend of eight months turned out to be a cheating sleeze, and after I gave her her *third* chance, I decided even though I'm not much of a human, I deserve more. I'm not too fussed because I know things at this age (18) are only for fun and shit, and I really *really* enjoyed hanging out with her.

I'm so, *so* alone. My dad and I don't get along. At all. My upped Prozac dose no longer pulls me out of this isolated sess-pit with a history of botched suicide attempts and self-harm scars. I'm only in my first week of a 4 month summer holiday, with no promise of college (Irish university acceptance depends on a point system based on grades which arent released until September)

 I have no-one to make plans with, anything to look forward to. To be honest, no-one to live for, not even myself. I feel so alone. 


TL;DR I'm depressed and suicidal, with nothing to look forward to 




 or shave a few years off their life

 Thank you for answering my question 




 Maybe it's because my ancestors are Scandinavian irl, Could be a gut instinct to go with the Nord side haha 




 I also get a bounty for attacking them, in Stormcloak territory. Oh well 




 Because the empire has no right to just march in and take land that has been Stormcloak for years! Skyrim is the Stormcloak's land, not the empire or the thalmor 




 Yeah, I might try a new save with the Empire just to see what it's like, just for fun 




 [STORMCLOAK OWNED SKYRIM] Unlocked a door in Understone Keep to find nord Kottir Red-Shoal in a secret meeting with two Thalmor. The thalmor only say 'Worshipping Talos is striclty forbidden' while Kottir says things like 'Talos guide you' and 'Keep your eyes open'. Theres a map of skyrim on the table. Can anyone shed some light on what's going on here? 




 They are racist and arrogant with their whole Aryan Nord race, But Skyrim was theirs before the empire came in 




 PC fag ;) 









 I chose Stormcloaks because they reminded me of Irish rebels and the Imperials reminded me of the British Empire. Being irish myself it was a no-brainer

 Yeah it just makes you lazy, It's like that tipsy sobering-up buzz you get at the end of a night of drinking, where youre just chilled out and relaxed 




 Yeah, I want the sativa high to help open my mind for music writing 




 is that sativa or indica? or a hybrid? 




 Any day 




 Agh I'm jealous. I want some to help me with writing music 




 I've been doing indica for a while now and even my dealer can't source sativa. The way it works where I'm from is everything is just called 'weed' and your dealer just gives you whatever he has on him. Not asking for buying advice (rules) just wondering what sativa is like to get your hands on with other Ents

 Im starting college next month and Im hoping to bulk up and continue working out through college.

The past 3 days ive used this plan:
20kg benchpress x 10 reps x 3 sets
Sit ups x 15 reps x 4 sets
Bicep curls 8kg x 10 reps x 3 sets
Butterfly leg lifts 2kg x 5 reps x 3 sets
I also run 4 miles twice a week. 

 I would like to up the intensity of my workout and depending on whether I stick with the plan, I'll get on protein. Can someone help organise a schedule with me?

If your SO loves you they will be patient with you and help you find all the care and help, be it through therapy or medication, you need to return a succesful relationship, both a sexually and mentally healthy relationship 




 The fact you posted this for help, and also resisted your temptation shows you're more than able to recover. Try taking a deep breath, calming yourself, and pin your hands down your pockets and keep them there. Alternatively, perhaps seeing a therapist once off, or an anger management tutor. Maybe it's a past experience that makes you want to throw a punch?
