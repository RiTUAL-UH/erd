 I've must've wasted more than 15 pieces of paper trying to wrap my mind around this.

A tank is half full of oil , which has density 920kg/m3. Find the work (in joules) required to pump the oil out of the outlet. Assume g=9.8m/s^2.

The tank is a right circular cylinder and is lying on its side. The radius is 1.5m and the pump extends 1m. The length is 6m.

 Try [electro-swing.com!](http://electro-swing.com). they have lots of different genres of swing, lengthy dj sets but really awesome tracks!

I like minimal beats too. Beats are suppose to compliment a good swing track, just like salt and pepper are suppose to compliment a good steak.

 Sweet. He's in Vancouver now. Lucky us.  




 This is a fantastic source, thanks so much. 




 Thank you! 




 My sister believes that at some point Canada had a climate similar to one at the equator, before the Ice Age. I know that Canada has sub-tropical and arctic climates but I can't find any information to refute her. 

Is it possible that at some point in history northern part of North America had a desert or rainforest climate? 




 Ay Ah ah ah Ay! 




 The earth is 3 million miles (5 million km) closer to the sun in January than in July. 





























 Works perfectly with clash! Reminds me of the youtube video of the guys with the crazy dance moves

 You could also talk about your experience dealing with a difficult school subject, describing your problem area(s) and how you overcame it through receiving extra help from a tutor, or going out of your way to make sure you'd ace the material and you've learned how to stay motivated, not to give up, etc. Hope that helps. 

Good luck! 




 It's funny because part of the building is up for lease too. Farewell imaginary government agency. 
























 I'm more offended by the fact he forgot the definition of feminism.

 I'm not sure how vintage this is but I love all the dresses from [this boutique](http://www.lilyboutique.com/dresses). reasonable prices too. 
Happy hunting! 




 Ew, that projection. 
























 typically, deserts are ~30 degrees from the equator and rain forests at 0. 




 Oh, interesting. I didn't know that. Thanks! 




 yup! And endangered species are removed from the endangered species list because those interfere with the pipeline 




 That is a very fair argument, climate is the long term pattern of weather and meteorologists rely on those patterns and should be able to communicate their findings amongst other scientific communities. 

I find article interesting because the "gag-order" also involves federal employees such as university professors whose research gets funded by the government as well as those climate change scientists who are employed by the federal government. 
























 Just raise the corners of your mouth with a middle finger 
























 I've adopted a cat from a colleague who has never taken her to a vet before. Since I've had the cat, she's been begging to go outside so I bought her an RF collar and took her to the vet to get all her proper shots; Feline Leukaemia Virus and Rabies.

2 days later, the area of the injection site has become very sensitive and she's developed a small lump. I took her back to the vet, administered anti-inflammatories for the next 3 days and applied hot compressions. The swelling and the pain don't appear to be reduced.

The vet said the inflammation should disappear within a few days (and it has a 0.01% chance of being cancerous) and that I should bring her back in a week if the bump hasn't disappeared.

It's been 5 days now and everytime I google the problem, I get hits for Sarcoma. (I had a pet die from vaccine-related sarcoma  a few years ago and I really don't want to jump to conclusions).

Can anyone here offer me an explanation as to why my cat has developed this bump?

Thank you. 









 Reminds me of this product: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7DN3kpl2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7DN3kpl2o)

Id just buy the panties and the app and go about my day pretending to text people. 




 I personally take the bus myself, but I've heard that some students find free street parking close to Sasamat or Blanca, and hop on the 99/4/14/9 for a very short ride to campus.   




 :') 




 Yup. And what's even more interesting is that during the N. Hemisphere summer, the Earth is actually 3.2 million miles further from the sun than it is during the N. Hemisphere winter  




 Happy Summer Solstice!
 




 Probably, theoretically yes. But even in this sci-fi world, if it behaved anything like our planet, the equator will still receive a lot of solar radiation creating a low pressure zone with lots of precipitation because the hydrologic cycle would still exist, so whatever rain forests would be left, would probably be concentrated near the equator.  




 Wouldn't "Greenland" and the northern Canadian "lakes" would also be frozen and covered in ice, since theres no outlet? 
























 Small pieces of egg shells worked really great for me! 




 Thanks! 




 Thanks, that sort of makes sense

So, if it happened on a shallow boundary or on the surface on a transform fault it would be just as destructive? 




 What makes the atomic bomb so much more destructive even though it releases less energy? Is it because seismic waves don't travel as fast as the atomic bomb "waves"?

Is it because the area of initial impact is smaller?   




 lol. 




 not for me... 

"Nothing requires your attention right now..." 

 









 Thank you. 
I've read that vaccines could be administered through the tail as well; its just as effective and is easier to amputate in case something develops.

I'm bringing the cat back to the vet tomorrow because the swelling and the pain haven't disappeared. 

 




 Yes.  
























 I assume its the date the store opened.  




 Now that pennies are 'banned' in Canada, I'm craving to make a giant world map with all the extra ones I have.

 hahaha YES! except it isn't a crappy Mercator! 




 The detail in topography was amazing! I'm pretty sure the red-dish colours indicate countries that produce wines they carry. 









 If you prefer to sit in the aisle on your flight but there "aren't any more aisle seats left", go up to the counter attendants at your gate and whisper to them that you have a bladder infection and you don't want to disturb other passengers. Haven't failed so far. 




 I guess he didn't get the memo about [](/s "Tara...") 




 WHOA! I only saw that once I turned my screen brightness to the maximum. 

Now I just find this pic really creepy. 
























 Where did you find this info? 




 Okay, was that Zachary Levi at 1:18 or am I just wishfully imagining things?

 Now I'm a little curious..
