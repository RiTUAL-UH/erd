 I put up my profile on a popular online dating websites. I received a "flirt" from a guy I think is attractive and seems quite nice (I'm a female). What should I say in my first few messages to help us get to know each other? Are there specific things I should avoid? I'm totally new to the online dating world and don't want to mess up a good opportunity.

 Thanks for the great input, much appreciated:) It's nice to hear that you had an experience as an individual instead of designated racial representative. 




 It would be Johannesburg in South Africa. And yes I was leaning towards Amsterdam actually. It seems to be beautiful and quite diverse from an outsider's perspective. And yay for the hair products, I was assuming I'd have to stock up beforehand. 




 What does YMMV stand for? And i wasn't calling our experience in online dating as "oppression", more like being overlooked, from my friend's perspective. Oppression would be being banned from the site or reduced rights in comparison to others.  




 My female friend and I decided to venture into the online dating world together, using OkCupied and POF. I'm of Dominican descent and she is a biracial American, I feel we are both cute:) We have had some hits and misses with the whole online dating scene but nothing terrible so far. My friend muses that we've had less success than some of our fairer skinned friends because people see dark brown skin and automatically dismiss us as possible companions. Raptors, do you feel like this happens alot in our dating scene? As an oppressed group you would think we'd be a little more sensitive to other groups' plight but maybe not. 




 I'm in the process of choosing where I would like to study abroad as a part of my graduate school curriculum but I'm a bit stuck on where I should choose to go. I have the option of Ecuador, Peru, Spain, Amsterdam, South Africa, or London. It would be for two months. I'm also nervous about being a black woman overseas, I generally know what to expect as a black woman in the U.S. but I'm not sure how things might be different in other countries. What have your experiences been like? Would you go again or recommend it to other black women?

 My PA gave me a handy little list of things to help: Pinch nostrils below the bridge of your nose, if that doesn't work apply something cold to same area. Another option is to use a product like Afrin that causes vasoconstriction and slows blood flow. Also helps to keep the area moisturized.  




 Yup I got my right nostril cauterized last year after enduring years of half hour long nosebleeds. After missing an exam because of a particularly bad one, I went to the doctor's. The pain was minimal and so far I haven't had any reoccurrences.  




 Gay marriage has been legal for awhile now in Iowa bro. 




 Thanks for doing the math on that, it's interesting. With that being said, when I was 21 there was no way I'd date someone who could still be in high school. I feel like there's a lot of difference in life experience still. Just my opinion though, I know some would.

 I'm sure everyone has seen the rankings of PA schools, but how much does it really matter where you attend school? This is an honest question because I'm really not sure which program to pick. I was aiming for a school close to home so I will receive in state tuition, but people have been telling me to aim for more "highly regarded" programs. Will the school and program I choose really affect my career path as a PA?

 First of all, sorry if anything in my title was the wrong terminology. Ok to the issue. I'm at a point in my life where I'm not sure if I'm a lesbian or if I'm ftm. Yes, I know that one is a sexual orientation and the other is gender identity, but to me the lines sort of intersect.

I've lurked here for awhile and noticed I do some of the same day to day things as others on this sub. I wear men's cologne sometimes, definitely a fan of Calvin Klein boxerbriefs, and try to downplay my femininity to a certain extent. I would love to cut my hair into a tapered cut, it's long now, but I'm afraid of parental and sorority sister backlash. 

My identity time line went from bisexual in middle school, lesbian, to now wondering if I'm trans. When I was a kid, I actually cried over the fact that I didn't have a penis and was devastated when I got a period and grew breasts. You couldn't tell me that the world wasn't over, I was so uncomfortable. I tried to pee standing up and God help the person at McDonalds who gave me a girls' toy. I was happiest with hotwheels and nerf guns. 

I'm 23 now and my style is a blend of men's and women's styles. I'm ok with my breasts and body but sometimes envy the athletic male body type and fantasize about having it myself. I date femme women. Has anyone else gone through the struggle of trying to figure out if they're a "mannish" lesbian or really ftm? Sorry for the novel and any poor choice of words.  




 I'm currently renting a room within a person's home on a month to month basis for $500 in Iowa. I paid a deposit but we never signed a specific rental agreement laying out terms. I've been here for a week and don't think this situation will work out because her kids are more unruly than I anticipated and conditions aren't as advertised (wiring and water pressure are shot). I have lined up a new living situation but havent signed a lease yet. What are my rights as far as getting my deposit back? Should I consider my first month's rent lost? I have messages saying the deposit is refundable from the landlord. Thanks for any advice. I'm new to living on my own, this is my first year out of university housing. 




 I've been in the area for several years but this will be my first time having to drive to work and school in the winter this year. Up until now I biked and used the Cyride. I realize it's August lol but I'm considering buying a car with AWD so I'm wondering if the winter months are bad enough to justify the purchase or if I could get by with my Camry. My commute is about 15 mins. Do they clean the streets fairly well? 




 I'm considering Cincinnati as a potential place to move after I finish PA school. I'm originally from the Midwest and Cincinnati seems big enough without being intimidating like other places. My questions are: Do you think Cincinnati is gay friendly? Do you think there are things to do for someone in their mid-twenties? How is cost of living?  




 I don't know how many of you saw the video about the older black woman cooking a "raisin turnover" yesterday but some of the comments caused me to ask myself "why do I keep using this website?!" I know there's good and bad to everything, and sometimes I really do enjoy Reddit, but sometimes the "justified racism" and ignorance causes me a lot of frustration. What keeps you coming back to Reddit? P.S. this is one of my favorite subs, it keeps me coming back!

Edit: title should by continuously 




 I'm in a bind and I need $1,300 to quickly pay for a debt I have at my university. If I don't pay by the 20th of August, my enrollment at school for the fall will be cancelled. I've been considering Discover personal loans to pay off the debt and then pay it off within the next six months. Does anyone has an opinion on Discover's loans? Or maybe my best bet would be going through a local credit union? I appreciate your feedback! 




 Lets hear some stories or good tips!

Edit: Can someone also answer if it's in bad taste to follow up with a company about your shortcomings as an applicant? Thanks guys, I'm grateful for all the helpful answers! 




 I've been searching for one bedrooms in the Ames area for quite awhile and finally decided to share a house. It's a pretty large house. I get my own bedroom and bath (for the most part) and shared common areas for $500, including utilities. I'm just curious what other people are paying in the Ames area. Too me it's kinda pricey compared to my hometown. If you're aware of any decent rentals available, feel free to share:) 




 Like I mentioned in the title, I recently lost my job. I've been searching for something within my field and the jobs I've found pay a lot less or would require me to move and commute to school. At this point I think my best bet would be to break the lease and find somewhere more affordable to live. I haven't moved in yet (it starts in mid July)  and the lease was an agreement with a homeowner, not an actual business.  What advice could you give to make this situation end as amicably as possible? What should I know? I'm in Iowa.  




 First time car owner here!

My main concern is the undercarriage of my 2006 Camry, is the underside supposed to be this exposed? The muffler and undercarriage just seem to jut out and I'm unsure if this is normal:

[Link to pic I took](http://i.imgur.com/TkGMZGu.jpg)

And my second question is, what would you estimate a repair for minor leaking at the pan gasket and steering rack boots? 

Thanks!


 




 Is there any chance there's an Ames reddit meetup happening? Or is anyone thinking of attending the Des Moines meetup at Waveland? I think it would be fun! 




 This week I attended a social justice conference and decided to sit in on conversation about transgender issues. One of the questions raised was, what makes someone a "real" woman? My immediate thought was anyone born with two x chromosomes, but is it really that simple? We're surely more than our parts. Others thought a certain style, personality or aesthetic made someone a female. Such as kindness, maternal-instinct, or being graceful or girly in dress. I felt like this description left out say, butch or more masculine females, who certainly do identify as women. I struggled with this question way more than I anticipated! So I am wondering how do you personally define womanhood?  




 I just purchased a 2006 Toyota Camry and would like to tighten the steering response, is there a way to do this? I previously drove my mom's Mazda and miss the tight response of the wheel. It takes a little more maneuvering with this camry. Thanks for any advice! I don't know a ton about cars, so if this the wrong terminology, sorry!  




 I thought asking fellow biology lovers would be helpful with my genetics homework. My teacher has given me fitness values and frequency of hbA and hbS in a population. 

So far I've found allele frequency for hbA and hbS in this population: p=0.135 and q=0.865.


For the second question I'm supposed to calculate allele frequency for the next generation. I've been over my notes 20 times but keep getting the wrong answer. I would like some help?

EDIT Someone wanted to see the whole problem:

6. In an area on the East coast of Africa with minimal medical facilities the fitness 
of HbA/HbA = 0.2, of HbA / HbS = 1.0, and of HbS / HbS is 0.1. The frequencies of 
these three genotypes in a newly arrived population of colonists are: 
 
HbA/HbA HbA/HbS HbS/HbS 
 0.75 0.23 0.02 
 
a. What are the frequencies of the HbA and HbS alleles in this population? 
b. What will be the frequencies of the alleles in the next generation? 
c. Considering the original population to be generation 1, what will be the genotype 
frequencies (at birth) in generation 3?


For the third we are supposed to calculate genotype frequency at birth for the third generation? 

Thanks for any help! 




 I wanted to get people's opinion between a 2007 Mercury Milan with 59k miles on it for $8995 or a 2009 Ford Fusion SE with 79k miles on it for $7300. Both of them drive decently, get good gas mileage and safety ratings. I'm not sure which brand will be more reliable in the long term, I'll be driving it at least for the next 5 years, probably more. This is my first car as a college graduate. I have a good job I'll be going to in the biotech industry this June, so my money is ok. Which car do you think would be the best purchase overall? Thank you! 









 As a minority in midwestern America, I pretty much know what to expect from day to day life: will probably be one of few in my science courses, might get looked at twice by the cops, never worry about sunburn. But I'm getting close to the end of my undergraduate years and would love to study abroad in Australia or the Netherlands, but I'm afraid of having a negative experience so far from home and have no clue how I might be perceived in a foreign country. POC (or friends of POC), how did your experiences away from the U.S. go? Would you do it again? 




 I'm applying to PA schools soon and have very small bills like car insurance ($100) and cell phone ($60) that I need to maintain, plus rent if I choose to go get an apartment. 

How does everyone pay their bills? Do you take out the entirety in loans? What if you have car loans still active while entering?

Thanks from an eager pre-PA student! 




 My basic situation is this: I'm a college senior about to graduate with a B.S. in biology, applying to physician assistant programs in a year or so. I currently have $21,000 in debt ($230 a month starting in December). I work part time making $11.50/hr as a lab assistant in the Biology department at my school. In the fall, I'll be taking one or two extra classes to complete the prerequisites for the PA program I'd like to apply for. One of the classes I need to take is quite far away and I have no car and there is no bus that will go that far out. There is a 2010 Honda Accord with 40,000 miles for $12,500 that a friend is offering to sell because he's leaving for military duty. I have only $1,000 saved and would have to take out the rest in loans. Would you advise against this? I chose the Honda because they're reliable and after a devastating car accident 2 years back, I'd like a car with good safety ratings.

My second question/problem ties into the car issue above. Next fall I could be a community adviser, which would make me eligible for free housing, which would save me about $630 a month. They will pay me $325 a month, but I'm limited to working 10 hours per week of outside employment, which is practically nothing. At most I might make another $420. Total around $745.

My second option would be to just get a regular apartment here for around $550-650 per month and most likely be working full time. I doubt I'll find a first job paying more than $12/hr.

First, I'm not sure whether to take out the car loan. It is necessary but I'm terrified of taking out a car loan with student loans looming 6 months away. If I take the CA housing position, the $325 could cover car and insurance, but not a ton of money leftover for groceries etc. Or just rent an apartment normally, and pay $660 for rent a month, probably $350 for car payment/insurance and other expenses. I'm sorry for the wall of text and I tried to make it as clear as possible. This is the situation I'm currently stuck in. What do you believe would be the most fiscally responsible thing to do? Thanks for any help or pointers. 









 I've been watching the news lately, and have heard talk of the U.S. denying aid to places like Uganda in response to the new bill that was recently signed making gay relationships punishable by law. In regards to Russia, Obama has stated his disapproval of what is happening with their "gay propaganda" law. On the hand, it is very well known that lgbt individuals in places like Iran or Saudi Arabia are mistreated but I don't see as much of a response on the U.S.'s part. A friend and I have been wondering/arguing, why the difference?
 









 For the question we are supposed to determine what is the probability of the first child having schizophrenia since it has an uncle with the condition. I'm not sure how to solve the problem without a pedigree to off of. Here is the prompt:

A couple has come to you for genetic counseling. The woman was adopted and has just learned that her biological brother has schizophrenia, although he is the only member of the family with the disorder. The couple is expecting their first child and are concerned that the child might have schizophrenia. The frequency of schizophrenia in unrelated individuals in this population is .01.

Thanks for any help! 




 I hope this is the right subreddit! I donated blood with the Red Cross awhile ago and they told me that I'm a good match for sickle cell patients. Apparently I have CEK negative blood, but I have no clue what that really means. Could someone explain what that is and why I'm a good donor for sickle cell disease patients? I'm a biology student so don't be afraid to use technical terms. 
Thanks!  




 Let me explain, if case the title isn't clear. I was just in class getting the notes I had missed during Friday's lecture. Group mate proceeds to ask where I was on Friday, and I say I was in Kansas City for MBLGTACC (aka the big gay conference, you should look it up ). I realize they have no idea what the acronym stands for and I explain it's basically a networking/partying opportunity for LGBT folks in college/higher education. Cue the interested nods of some of my group mates and cricket sounds from the Muslim female member of my group. The rest of our interactions during class were kind of tense and awkward, with her avoiding eye contact with me. We'd previously been friendly up to this point! Does anyone else get the coming out of the closet deja vu? I haven't been out very long and I'm wondering if it gets any better?

 I'm deciding whether I would like to apply to medical school to become a doctor or whether to attend PA school. I've researched the differences in educational requirements and basics like that. But I'd like to know the day to day and overall differences in the way doctors and PAs practice medicine. I'd appreciate the observations or experiences of those who work in the healthcare industry. What factors made you choose doctor/PA over the other? 









 Can someone explain this phenomenon biologically? It seems like with solo or partnered sex I always feel the need to urinate. If I don't finish to orgasm and use the bathroom, I actually do pee. I'm not drinking alot of liquids before sexual activity. I thought  orgasm and urination couldn't happen at the same time, or is this only in men? If someone could clear this up, that'd be great! It's sort of annoying actually.

 Depends on the outcome of their lie. If it's pre-donation and usage of the donation, they will be put on our permanent deferral registry and wouldn't be able to donate anywhere in the country. Huge red mark.

If they make it through donation, it's a different story. When I was going through my training I was told about a guy who ended up doing jail time for possibly contaminating the supply and fined several thousand dollars. Outcomes will vary. 




 HIV and prion diseases are totally different beasts.  




 I worked as a phelbotemist at a blood center for awhile, basically every potential donor has a long questionnaire that includes questions about potential sexual lifestyle hazards. If you are a male, have you ever had sexual contact with another male? Medical supervisors review questionnaires and anyone deemed a risk is permanently banned from donating. It basically relies on honesty because I've seen people who are gay donate (I don't know if they're sexually active or virgins or what).  




 Why only white lesbians? Do you have evidence of HIV rates behind high among lesbians of other racial groups? I know your statement was a hypothesized, but still.

 I totally see your point, I think the reason it's often called "feminism" is because while men do have some issues in our society, women have more "catching up" to do in terms of social equality. For example how women weren't always allowed to vote etc. 

It's often named in terms of the group that needs uplifting. Like how gay people are trying to get the same marriage and non-discrimination rights as straight people, so "gay rights".

 I've used those cheap travel sized deodorants after shaving or when I get ingrown hairs, works wonders. Of course I wouldn't use it right before hooking up, would taste gross I imagine. 




 Why not talk about your job? I feel like for most people in their mid twenties it's a common experience. 




 Aww:) 




 People talk about gay and straight people all the time, no one says gay and normal. That's not really a fair comparison either. Being gay requires not treatment or feelings of dysphoria that often come with being trans. 




 hole concept of maleness and femaleness

heh 




 I'd rock the hell out of that outfit. I would love to find something similar at broke college kid prices. 




 Interesting, I was born a female (identify as well) and went through the same thing. Hated my budding breasts as a middle schooler and broke down in tears when I got my period. I wore sports bras all the time to try and conceal them. Felt like my life was over for some reason. I remember getting into epic battles with my mother over wearing dresses to church,  but I was not having any of that shit.

I'm 23 now and am no longer uncomfortable with myself. It's really weird how this stuff (identify and so forth) works. For what it's worth I am a lesbian though. I hope you get the change you desire! 




 Can I ask how you correlate breasts with womanhood? Many women (like my sister for example) are practically flat-chested or have them removed for surgical reasons, but don't seem to feel dysphoria. What is it about your penis that bothers you? I'm just trying to understand what you're feeling. Would you rather have a vulva, clitoris, period etc? 




 They're thumb thumbs from the Spy Kids movie.

 Plasma is one component of your blood, among other things. They separate it from the red blood cells, those go back into your body. 




 Former Biolife employee here, there's a lot of in-house training that goes into doing phlebotomy (needle sticks). While the majority of the people in a center aren't nurses (maybe 4 tops) there's a ton of reading and training videos to go through before you even do a stick and then a month of shadowing before you're able to do sticks on your own. If you're not cut out for handling needles you'll get stuck doing reception. 




 I used to work for Biolife and can say the in-house training for phlebotomy (needle skills) is top notch. Can't speak for other center though.

 No, Xanax is a benzodiazepine which has more of a sedative, muscle relaxant effect, very good for panic attacks. 

Beta blockers can mediate the physical effects of anxiety, like the fight or flight response. Such as increased heart rate, sweating etc. It has other medial uses also.  




 Same here friend. It was never really a problem until one summer I had eight different flights in a two month time span. During a physical I mentioned the terrible anxiety I get during flights and my doctor prescribed me a beta blocker, propranolol and it worked wonders. Totally calm during the whole flight and it doesn't make me tired.  




 I really want to move to Oakland after I finish with my master's. Is the crime in Oakland as people make it out to be or is it isolated to certain areas? 




 First off, I really enjoyed your post! Second, forgive me if this is a dumb question but where do you meet other black lesbians at? I swear I've exhausted all my POC options and can't find non-white girls for the life of me. Like you, I can't really see myself with a white girlfriend and I like femmes (also femme), but I feel like white chicks are my only option or remain single for the foreseeable future lol. My going to school at a PWI in a small Midwestern town might have something to do with it:/ I really want to move 




 Thanks bro!  




 Explain please? I'm interested.  




 Where did you move from, if you don't mind my asking. I'm black as well and considering moving to Portland after I'm done with school. I live in Iowa now and I need somewhere more queer friendly.  




 I found the statistic about black physicians really interesting. I'm in the process of applying to medical schools while working on my master's at a PWI in the midwest. My freshman year there were lots of other POC that were pre-med and pre-dental hopefuls. By my senior year most had changed to something else or dropped out. I wonder what HBCUs do right that PWIs are getting wrong?

 The first time I felt like I actually fit in somewhere. In high school I was the sweet, but incredibly awkward kid. No one in particular picked on me, but you get tired of always feeling like the odd man out. It sucks to feel like you missed out on milestones and memories. Come freshman year of college I was determined to change my life and not be an observer anymore. I found some balls and went to the rugby team's practice session alone and inexperienced, and had a blast! For once being an athletic female who likes video games didn't make me weird. 

Five years later many of those people are still my best friends and they totally shaped my college experience. I even met my first longterm relationship through a teammate. It's awesome to have a group of friends that feel like family and to let your guard down with.

 1. My personal favorites with good sound and comfortable for long term wear. They are lightweight and ear pads are very comfy: [Sennheiser HD 598](http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-598-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B0042A8CW2/ref=sr_1_5?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842099 sr=1-5)
2. [Bose AE2i](http://www.amazon.com/Bose-Audio-Headphones-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B008YUNHK8/ref=sr_1_34?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842178 sr=1-34) Super light-weight and cushy. Noise-cancelling.
3.

Sound is good for my songs that are rock or hip-hop based. Probably the most aesthetically pleasing out of the bunch.
4. Either of these models are great for sound quality and build, but they tend to be a little heavy for long term usage: [Audio-Technica ATH-M50](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000ULAP4U/ref=sr_1_2?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842099 sr=1-2), [Sony MDR7506](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E/ref=sr_1_7?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842099 sr=1-7), and [Beyerdynamic 80 ohms](http://www.amazon.com/Beyerdynamic-770-PRO-80-ohms/dp/B0016MNAAI/ref=sr_1_14?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842099 sr=1-14)

 It depends on the context really. The last time I was at a conference and talking about social identities, I used the word "lesbian" because it's a widely understood term, no confusion. Among friends or acquaintances I say "gay". When with other LGBT friends I might jokingly say dyke or vagina enthusiast. I entirely avoid homo or homosexual, it's sounds cold and technical. Plus conservatives make it sound like some terrible pathology.

 That's a good philosophy to have, I'm gonna borrow that. You sound like quite the interesting preschool teacher :) 




 I just started a new job as a technician at a medical facility and a couple supervisors have made false assumptions about me being straight. For example, I was complaining about having to move out of my apartment and my supervisor said, "What you need to do is go out and find yourself a nice boyfriend to take care of those things, hurr hurr!". Being that he's my supervisor, I was unsure of whether to correct him that I'm in fact a strong lesbian who don't need no man. I am out to one coworkers who I know is friends with many LGBT people, but otherwise no one knows. I wondered if my fellow Raptors are out at work, especially when the topic of dating pops up? 




 Is it weird that I didn't know kinky hair could be grown any where but on the head? I've never seen nappy eyebrows or leg hair, I wonder if that exists? 




 I tried it and it worked wonderfully. Focus on the mons, not the inner labia and definitely not near the vaginal opening. There's also Skin Tight and Witch Hazel that are very good as well. 




 I wondered the same thing with that trans kid who stepped out in front of a truck. Why scar someone else for life? I don't think people with suicidal depression give a whole lot of critical thought to their actions.  




 Thanks!  




 But what do ladies "feel like" in comparison to men? 




 I'll give a definition slightly different than the one above. It's been explained to me as one's "internal sense" of being a male or female, sometimes neither (genderqueer) or both. A sense of gender identity is more defined in some people. For example, I don't feel like I have one, the concept doesn't make a ton of sense to me either.

 Can you please explain to me the scientific link between testosterone levels and income? Also, how do testosterone cause crimes like embezzlement and and fraud? 




 But we don't look at modern Hispanics as evil slave-owners.

There's a fair amount of animosity for Spaniards and Brazilians for their role in the slave trade. From an academic and social stand point I don't think it's overlooked at all. As far as Jews go, undereducated people lump Jews in with whites. 

Also, the form of slavery that occurred in the U.S. is unlike any other form of slavery in human history. Prior to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, slaves were of all races. The U.S. slave trade was unique because it focused solely on Black Africans (with a minority of other groups) as this was their "natural place" and then even after gaining freedom instituted share-cropping, Jim Crow etc etc. The social aspect is entirely unique. 




 I'm not saying you're wrong but in a number of my genetics classes my professors have said there more genetic similarity between randomly chosen black and white people than between two black people who you think would share similarity.

 I used to think I was bi up until my freshman year of high school, but that changed during a sleepover with several of my best friends. You know how late at night with friends you tend to talk about your sexual experiences thus far and get a little more daring? My friends mentioned how excited they got kissing boys,  and enjoyed feeling their muscles and erections. 

I wasn't as experienced as my friends, mostly made out here and there, and some dry humping. I had only seen one penis in real life. I compared my experience to theirs and wondered why I didn't feel the crazy attraction and excitement that they did. And what the hell was wet (I was a sheltered child!). I mostly felt nothing or mildly grossed out. 

That changed when my best friend and I decided to sneak off and watch porn after everyone else fell asleep. It featured a pretty red-head and a brunette kissing and tribbing each other. 1 minute into the porn and my clit throbbed and I was more interested in sex than I'd ever been. I guess the film made my friend feel a little adventurous because she leaned over and gave me a peck on the lips. I'd thought I had a "girl-crush" on her before, but this confirmed real feelings. My head rushed and I could feel my heart pumping in my chest. So this is attraction, finally! Even though she ultimately ended up being straight, and I gay, it was my first time  feeling a strong emotional and physical attraction to someone. I realized I wasn't broken, I liked women. And cue, long emotional coming out process. 




 Things don't always play out the way they did here. I complained to my supervisor about one of my fellow black employees calling me the N-word constantly during this. Nigga this, nigga that. At first my supervisor thought I was joking but I told him it offended me and it's not ok just because it's coming from another POC. Long story short, he got in trouble for using racial slurs but was pissed at me for snitching and didn't see why I was mad. I'm glad my old employer had an anti-slur policy, doesn't matter who says it.

 Ah I see, I have no idea of the logistics behind that. Interesting point. I know many hospitals hire PAs and ARNPs because they're cheaper for them in the long run. Should be for the patient also.  




 Ch-ch-ch-chia!

 Can I ask what's wrong with PAs or med students? They are working under the supervision of an MD or DO, whatever diagnosis they come to will be checked over. Plus, most primary care illnesses don't need an MD for treatment.

 I used to work the last shift in a plasma center. Around 20 minutes before close we'd begin closing down stations to go home for the night. This involved bleaching down everything and putting away equipment. There is always that one person who'd come in 2 minutes before close so I'd have to reopen the booth and bring everything back out, then rebleach once done. Fuck you person, you could come earlier.

 I seriously agree with the psychologically addictive part. I started drinking soda in my college cafeteria just because it was there at dinner. I began craving it on a regular basis after a couple days, even the kinds that didn't taste that great.

 Agreed. Learning about the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in my microbiology class freaked me out a little.

A good side note is, if you actually need the antibiotics, take the whole prescription. Don't stop when you start feeling better. The leftover bacteria will contribute to growing resistance. 




 As punishment force them to repackage the monitors in the awful styrofoam and plastic, and put back in the box correctly.

 Bench, squat, dead and variations of those

Wait so you're saying I cannot do those exercises with an EZ curl barbell? Just making sure. Why not? 




 I'm a total newb to fitness so I have 3 stupid questions:

1. Any tips for doing a proper deadlift? I feel like I'm getting pains in my back for a reason.

2. Are there any exercises that you can't do with a EZ curl barbell that you normally can with a regular/straight barbell?

3. Whenever I use the inner thigh machine at the gym (squeezing thighs closed with about 40 lbs of weight) I get a very weird painful sensation in my groin, is that normal? I'm a girl if that helps.

 Hmm. But as a gay person when people call my inborn sexuality a sin, I think of all the other major sins: murder, theft, adultery etc. Have your sexuality be compared to grievous crimes and all around negative things kind of hurts. Not saying you're wrong, but it's just my two cents.  




 I thought "it" was the third-person singular? I'm not into linguistics though.

 My uncle (A black guy) went to Alaska on military duty and he got really "pale" for a black person but he didn't lose all this melanin. I think the difference is in brown people their melanocytes are genetically programmed to produce a base level of melanin, extra coloring is given as a result of sunlight stimulation. So he got paler because he lost the extra light stimulation but still had the base level of production.

 I'm black and I had nothing to do with those retards in Missouri. No fucking way. 




 Just a thought about savings, not exactly correlated to race: if you work a crap job where you barely pull in enough to cover necessities, you're probably not going to have anything to put into savings. For example, I'm a college student who can only find part-jobs that work with my school schedule, most of those pay little. I can put some away, but if my tire blows or I have a health emergency, well I have to pull from saving and I'm back to square one.

And flashy items like what? I know black people who live in poor neighborhoods of big cities, and one guy had never seen an Ipod before and most didn't have internet access outside of a library. Shitty old cars and cheap furniture. I'm black btw, middle class. I'm not saying you're perspective isn't valid but I've seen otherwise. 




 Glad to find someone else who thinks this way. I feel like we we're a rare breed and people feel like you're an oppressor for knowing who you are or what's normal for you.

 I don't know why, but it bothers me so much when someone calls it a "lifestyle". Like gee, I go to school, travel, date and worry about my future, what an alternative lifestyle I lead! 




 Yes, I'm getting tired of feeling that way as well, especially being careful of the pronouns I use when talking about exes or the date I just went on. It's much easier to be yourself. 
























 I've seen similar things on Huffpost Black Voices and it makes me pretty angry. For one things it implies that there's something inherently wrong with femininity and masculinity is always the standard to be upheld. 

There's been accusations that these shows are white people's attempt to destroy the black family. As a queer identifying black women, I have to ignore the identity erasure. Ah, the beauty of intersectionality.

 I'm in the process of applying for jobs for this summer and there is pretty much always "optional" questions asking for race, ethnicity, and gender  identification. Back in high school I experienced a "processing error" every time I checked black. So I decided to experiment and click white. Received a smiley face and was told my application had been submitted.  Now as a college grad I'm unsure if I should check the black box, prefer not to answer, or straight up lie.

My sorority sister (also gay) and I were discussing how our neuroscience book says lesbians are more likely to be lefthanded. We also think lesbians have deeper voices than the general straight female population. Just curious:)

Edit: So at the time I counted 37% were left handed compared, compared to about 10% of general population. 14% ambidextrous. About 41% of you felt you have a deeper voice. I am not a scientist, but I like stats like these :)

 I was thinking they would have fit in as a member of the Volturi in Twilight.  




 I was thinking good place to put the onion dip 




 The knee's not the only thing that's gonna get jerked.  




 So if the patient who received the knee replacement gained a lot of weight, would the replacement fail?  




 Wascally wabbits! 




 Well then

*scuttles away* 




 Trainer or therapist? 




 Same here, underrated imo. I check to see if there's a possibility of a sequel, but I don't think that's ever gonna happen. 




 True, I can respect different experiences. A lot of different things come in to play here. I didn't grow up in a big city, but a mid-sized fairly diverse town in the midwest. My family's middle class as well. I have a ton of sympathy for people who are both minorities and poor. It's tough to break out of that mold. I wish your friend the best. 




 Your comment is so far off from my experience as a Black person. Everyone I know of is proud of me for going to graduate school and are supportive in numerous ways. My mother's church raised several thousand dollars to help me with tuition over the years, helped me move, and put my accomplishments (and the other students' as well) in the local newspaper. My dad was angry when I had a B in calculus in high school. How does this add up to black culture being anti education? I grew up with Black people, am actually Black. People tease me for being a freaking nerd and always reading, in a playful way. I'm not attacking you I just felt the need for a different perspective from the generalization you posted. 




 Weird I'm black and have tons of African friends. 




 As a minority, I really appreciate this post. I don't think some people realize how tough it is to be a rep for, or carry the weight of your race around day to day. I'm in college and I often check my speech or behavior, for two reasons. One, so people don't say of course a black person would get a bad grade in biochem, they're dumb and lazy. And two, so my impression doesn't make it difficult for the person of color after me. Even doing these things I've had to deal with professors making questionable comments.


Sometimes I'm jealous of white people's ability to be individuals, it's quite the luxury. People take your character into account before they notice your race.

Anyway, I applaud you for yourself analysis :) 




 Agreed 




 Are you a serial killer then? 




 Darkness! What did the five fangers say to the face??

 I read this in Sergeant Doakes' voice.  




 Again?!  




 I'm sitting at 10 weeks, with about an inch of new growth maybe. Right now I think I'll wait until July to cut it. The different textures are getting a little difficult to manage so I'm trying to be gentle with it.  




 You're beautiful! How long did you transition for? I'm in that period right now and getting antsy for the big cut. 




 /u/waffletoast are you me? These are exactly the two pets I want! I've been trying to find one at a shelter bc breeders are too dang expensive.

Try daily.  




 How do you know they're less qualified unless you see their personal statement, letters of recommendation and resume? 




 No it's created by the society that might assume Chad is a better person than Alejandro or Demetrius, solely on the inference they're making from their name. 




 Whites don't have a Bible saying being black is a sin.

You might want to look up the the Curse of Ham.  




 Can I get a source on that? Especially that last bullet point. 




 I'm a black Humanist lesbian, but not wheelchair. Can anxiety count as my disability instead? 




 Latinos... 




 Obviously this time of year the library is overrun with people trying to cram for final exams,   do you have any recommendations for other places to get a nice study session in? 


Thanks!  




 Give them an education and get them to earn a degree

You kind of make it sound like a college in America is free or cheap. There millions of Americans who can't afford college or drowning in student loan debt. Who's going to pay to educate these immigrants? 




 Biodiverse? 




 I think the ones who wanna hit and run are over-represented. The settle down types are hard to find:( 




 Around this time last year. I met with a couple who sounded like a good match and settled everything with 3 other grad students in July. Took a little time to weed out sketchy people.  




 I found my roommates through Craigslist, good way to screen personality types to match yours. Otherwise there might be a Facebook page where you can make a post.  




 What's your upper body workout routine? Your biceps are inspiring! 
























 I've heard people say that the the old testament no longer applies to Christians after Jesus came because according to some new testament verse he's the fulfilment of the law. Then they quote anti gay new testament verse. I'm also at a loss on how to handle.  




 Lol my first thought exactly  




 Moist 




 Jesse Pinkman? 




 You're not the only one. I'm much more sociable and upbeat during my period. I have no idea why. Like, in the days before my period I'm miserable but during and days after I feel more normal, borderline happy. 




 Looks like Havarti. 




 According to my RES it's a thing. Only 6 subscribers. 




 Just a heads up, most POC find being called "exotic" offensive. 




 In your opinion, should the US take on poor people from all over the globe because life is hard?  




 So are you working on a cure for multiple sclerosis or developing an alternative fuel? I'm really interested in all the innovations you're currently contributing to society. 




 How do asexual and/or aromantic people fit into your understanding? 




 I swear you're one of few people in this thread with the common sense to realize that everything isn't for everyone. You have a healthy attitude. 




 So if a white murders blacks it's racist but a black murders white its an assault.

Twice to be specific. 




 Yeah it's definitely an article to bait people, and look it's working. That website doesn't look like the most trustworthy site I've ever seen. 




 Puts you in the mood for revenge racism? 




 Imo as a black person, this is a hate crime and I can't believe they didn't classify it that way. Attacking people for a stupid reason is horrifying and even worse that they included a child. Truly wtf is wrong with people. 




 Yay another Cyclone! Hope you get to visit the state fair, it's pretty awesome. 




 This gif was everything I hoped it would be :') 




 What would the right reasons be, in your opinion? 




 It's been 2 hours! What happened?! 




 Never thought I'd see this in my lifetime! 

So who wants to marry this queer Black lady? I'm adventurous, college educated and love cuddles :)  




 The way you put that was helpful actually.  




 If I don't feel like I have a gender identity, then I don't have to identify as cis, do I? I don't have a problem with dysphoria, so I'm not trans either. 




 Same here. 




 Black chick here. If I could find a "white-acting" black boy I'd actually be quite happy. 




 Hello, me. 




 Tuck's pad secret ingredient. 




 I was one of the ones who said I'm not interested in penises. I'm unlikely to be attracted to a transman because most of them get top surgery and I like boobs. I'm also unattracted to deep voices and large amounts of body hair, which some have after taking testosterone. 

And there are plenty of dildos that don't look extremely phallic- such as lack of veins or distinctive glans.  




 Agreed, this for me as well. 




 Stop making wild, racist accusations when OP hasn't said anything remotely race-related. You don't have the right to judge someone's identity or perception of their environment. Especially when you're not a part of it!

And if anything is "lesbophobic", you're username certainly is. 




 I don't think they're saying there's anything wrong with being butch, but as a butch OP should be horrified at their own behavior for being associated with this saying. I'm not agreeing with them, just clarifying. 




 I think it's wonderful that you're excited to go to a university where you and your wife will be accepted! I remember how excited I was to go to a school that was queer friendly and didn't have to hide a part of my identity. It sucks someone took a lighthearted quip and turned it into an attack. If anyone is aggressive and making wild assumptions it's them. And as a black person, I can't see how this person is feeling racially threatened by you. I wish you all the best :)

Edit: grammar 




 Embarrassed to say I just read the description and tried to imitate the noise lol 




 Where are you from? I'm intrigued by lesbian football teams and waterfalls :) 




 That was my first thought lol 




 What's your overall point? 




 A lot of people feel bad for Morello but I just can't find any sympathy for her.

 I'm pretty sure Gender Identity Disorder and dysphoria are classified as psychological issues

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity_disorder)
 




 Not OP but sometimes it is hard to deal with, it gets tiring after awhile. But I also know who I am, as well as my friends and family, all that we've accomplished. Most of the POC I know don't fit any one of the common stereotypes I see, so I know it's bullshit. I see a lot of the racist people on Reddit as ignorant and uncultured, and definitely not qualified to speak for "the black community". 




 My (black) church gets student for the university nearby all the time. We treat them like nice people who are interested in worship because that's what they normally are. I grew up in white Catholic churches and always was treated decently. 




 My worst nightmare was giving a presentation where I had to say "rural" like 34 times. I sounded like I was mentally challenged by the end, cant pronounce that word for the life of me. 




 That sounds really interesting. How did you end up in that specialty or is this your first PA job?  




 I didn't understand why she threw the turtle in the first place? 




 Or....

**HEDD2016** 




 You echo my thoughts exactly. 




 spicy salsa plus tobacco

Quite the recipe you've got there. 




 I think it's the fact that people don't see rice, black beans, protein, and cheese as calorie culprits as obviously as say McDonald's or other fast food. I think cutting the tortilla helps a lot.  




 What's the difference? I've never heard this word before! 




 Thanks for clearing that up. Even if the ad wasn't trying to be racist I still couldn't understand the point of the ad. 




 What? 




 This might sound dumb, but I used to be offended by the word "cis" because people were calling me a term that I didn't identify with. I knew what cis meant, "identifying with your assigned gender". I just didn't feel like I have a "gender" and I still feel that way sometimes. I have my biological sex which includes ovaries, breasts, and vag, personality, etc. I can't honestly say I feel I have some innate sense of womanhood anywhere in my being. 




 It's about culture and nationality, not skin color alone. Racial classification in the US isn't common outside the US.

Source: Mom is dark skinned Dominican, calls herself Latina- Dominican and nothing else. 




 I think the op is comparing Trans to other minority groups and saying they don't kill themselves due to depression caused by discrimination. 




 Nonbinary, meaning not male or female identifying.  




 Do you mean intersexed people?  




 On point. 




 Or the plot of Back Door Sluts 9 




 From what I read it seems they offer funding to public health programs that aim to reduce smoking, HIV/AIDs transmission, and reduce health disparities in minorities. It's not like a hospital is giving out free prescriptions and CAT scans.  




 Do you have a source on the quota for minority students? 




 How does being black give you easier access to health care?  




 I wish someone would tell my depression that:( 




 What happened?  




 T 




 Next commercial spot lol 




 What's wrong with saying female?  




 Saltier than Lot's wife.  




 Yup as an Iowan, I'm sad this is why we're being mentioned on Reddit for once.  




 Tonight we ride!  




 Black vape user here 




 The fuck?  




 Any advice about merging onto the highway? 




 I'm not weighing it, estimating with my fitness pal and with the nutrition facts on the back if it comes with that.  









 Yeah definitely. They're pretty strong and frequent too. 




 Lol sometimes my mom will be cutting potatoes for dinner and I'll grab a piece.  




 something, something White privilege. 




 HAES 




 Lobster. Nothing sexy about trying to crack a shell open and slathering the meat in butter. 




 Baby bear? 




 Nibble on it you heathen! 




 Eating raw potatoes makes my teeth feel really scummy for some reason. 




 Best way to piss my gf off? Eat one of those in bed right before she gets in. *Evil laughter* 




 Circumcise it. 




 Sorry you had a bad experience, maybe try finding another beautician.

I had the exact opposite experience about a month ago. I've had long relaxed since I was kid and recently decided I wanted to transition. Went to a new stylist and she refused to BC it because she couldn't understand why I'd want short natural hair:( 




 Writhing, back arching, deep moans, vaginal contractions...SPLOOSH!

My leg muscles tightened up once so bad it turned into a charlie horse.

 Hufflepuff boarding before Gryffindor? *Shots fired* 




 You sound like a good boyfriend:) 




 Exactly. My mother grew up through segregated schools and her sister's arm got broken by a cop for attempting to go. My rage level was through the roof reading that thread. 




 As a woman I'm not sure whether to feel sorry for you or afraid. Honestly, it's a mix of both. 




 I hate Tyler Perry not only because he plays into stereotypes but he's sexist as well imo.  




 You people sounds accusatory and like you're generalizing someone. My people is about being united and having things in common. 




 Triple minority here. It's not about skin color, it's about being united by certain experiences, struggles, and circumstances.  




 I'm guessing he's calling them his people because they're united by the same struggle and experiences, to a point.  




 Bingo. My grandparents lived through Jim Crow. My mom was around when schools were still segregated in the south. Our family was lucky to be able to move to the Midwest so their kids could get a decent education. This shit wasn't so long ago. 




 Give me an example? 




 It's speaking ghetto or hood. And it's a dialect not an accent. 




 misinformation 




 Interesting. I feel like most schools do but I'll do some research.  




 I'm not a jerk:) 




 How important is the GRE score in comparison to everything else (gpa, letters of rec, personal statement etc)?
