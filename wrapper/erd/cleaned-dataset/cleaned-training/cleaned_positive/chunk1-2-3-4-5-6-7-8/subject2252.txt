 Basically, you turned Bruce Wayne into Adam West, minus the plot devices 




 I meant for the purpose of this thread, but I didn't see anything along the lines of overused characters in my flair list, but since other threads like to love on a character for a day or two, my thread will be just fine 




 I figured Ditto would transform Into the first thing it sees with Imposter,  so in theory, couldn't it transform into someone else?  




 I'm only asking because the anime never seemed to give a conclusive answer for ss2 winning,  imo. The Manga might have expanded on it better. Also, I tried to put the time limit on for fairness, but apparently I created a Lolstomp 




 This whole thread just became "can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?" 




 r/whowouldcirclejerk 




 What if he doesn't see MMH first? Who would Ditto likely see in that case instead? 




 Yes, this has probably been done before, so if there are previous threads discussing my idea, by all means, link me to them.

My thought is that Goku would only have about half an hour or so on Earth in SS3 and he can't hold the form for too long. Would he be able to defeat Majin Vegeta in such a short time span (something like 7 or 8 minutes) using SS3,  given their fighting styles and knowledge of each other? Defeat here meaning incap, since Goku wouldn't kill Vegeta at this point in DBZ.

If Goku cannot defeat Vegeta in that short time span, then allow Goku the full hour or however long he would be allowed on Earth in SS3 for the fight.

If it is a total stomp, well, I can't think of a good thing that would help Vegeta that is also in the DB universe at the moment.

Edit: how do I add a flair or whatever for frequently used characters,  because I know these two see a lot of time on this thread (not necessarily against each other though) 




 HULK STOMP!! 




 I was going to post some complaints from my employer here, but compared to everyone else, mine is actually wonderful. We make everything from scratch, and people can even watch us make our products. My only complaint is that we are understaffed for the amount of business we see.

Context: I work in a pretzel shop (Ben's) in North-Central Indiana. 




 Alucard. One of the few stomp cards I dislike playing, for the most part.

He stomps rounds 1-5 easy enough, because if you kill him, he just comes right back. 
No wait, include round 6...He shoots Jake and eats Finn.
Round 7- The Lich: I give this to Alucard 7/10, depending on whether he unlocks control level 0, or he stays at control level 1.

For those who don't know: level 0 us basically where he unleashes the army comprised of everyone he has ever killed/consumed. 




 r/whowouldcirclejerk would probably say Batman, given enough prep time 




 Round 2: Dudley loses an ear. 




 What kind of style does Dudley have? I know Balrog was modified and based on Mike Tyson, so there is that 




 Ash Ketchum hasn't accomplished anything be wanted to do that he said he would do when he left Pallet Town. And he would likely be good leaning, but not be that efficient because nothing he ever does seems to make the villains of his world really go away 




 Any of the last three characters I selected in Marvel vs Capcom 3, so Deadpool, Wolverine, or Virgil 




 Definitely Pol Pit here 




 Thanks for that! 




 This sounds like a bakery I heard about in California, where they specifically employ felons and former gang members. I can't think of the name of said bakery right now though.  




 Did someone say gold? 




 I'm asking because I was wondering if I was the only fraternity member (Phi Kappa Tau) who noticed that members of his chapter talk about topics that seem off from the fraternity stereotype. The main things I've noticed are that I can get away with talking about anime when I want, and there is a huge circle jerk for Doctor Who (gotta spell out that Doctor part though). 









 I want to gild you, but I can't. 




 From what I understand, Deadpool is basically immortal. He may not be able to defeat everyone in 6 hours,  but, given the style of his comics, he would break 4th wall before being erased, and the audience wouldn't let him be erased. 
Also, I wouldn't take me seriously the moment I start mentioning Deadpool without good explanations.  




 If it turns out to be Captain America, grab an enemy of the Avengers (probably Ultron) the end. 

If it isn't Captain America, then my appeal is going out to Goku, because he always seems to give the benefit of the doubt and second chances out the ass, so what would be the odds of him ignoring me at this point in time, as a citizen who needs help turning over a corrupt system?

Also, I'd play reverse psychology on any villain I could. It is underhanded, but hey, we can't all be the saints of tomorrow. 




 Deadpool because Deadpool. Haters gonna hate 




 South Park Mickey Mouse stomps! Seriously,  he would view Capone as someone who is in the way of him making money, so he would dispose of him like the rest of the Disney could stars. 10/10 




 Johnson does at least 45 minutes- an hour of cardio several days each week, so that isn't too big of an issue. The issue for me is that a 3v1 turns into a stomp for the 3 in this situation. How about Johnson runs a gauntlet against them in order, and he is allowed an hour's rest in between each fight?

Edits: I changed "bug" to "big" 




 1. Batman can learn the situation and everything a lot easier than Barney so yeah...Batman wins round 1.

2. Barney would obviously be funnier, given his track record when it comes to dealing with criminals and whatnot.

3. How fucked is Gotham? Very. There is no way Fife can deal with any level of criminal if he isn't hardly able to deal with the people of Mayberry doing little things here and there. He would be a comedy character in a not so comedic world.

4. There would be no crime in Mayberry because Batman would either have everyone locked up, or he would have struck fear into their hearts. For a recall election,  that would likely never happen seeing how the master detective can deduce the situation (see #1) easily enough to win the affection of Mayberry and its citizens.
 




 Includes cat. Gets karma... 




 Definitely weed on the left side.  




 So, Cap would still have all of his combat training and muscular structure,  but he wouldn't have the shield,  correct? 




 Definitely Saitama going God status time!! 




 Do you count the super serum (iirc) as a power? I mean, it is technically a chemical he is exposed to, but it's kinda blurry for me on whether the serum counts as a power 




 This is likely true for me as well, since he is more than many levels smarter than most people my age (20) at 14 




 Time traveler kills Batman before he is born. Time traveler kills his parents. Time traveler kills infant batman. Time traveler kills 10 year batman. Time traveler kills 14 year old batman. 

Point is, this needs more specific details. Because time traveler goes back In time and kills batman before he becomes a threat to anything.

 I have two answers for this. 
Keeping in the same universe, I wanted to see the actual conclusion to the Majin Vegeta/SS2 Goku, not the plot device involving Majin Buu.

From different universes, I want to see Korra (after connecting to the spirits of past Avatars) fight someone like Picollo (post-Nail, pre-Kami for balance purposes)

Yes, I am going to be the guy who likes DBZ hypotheticals, but realizes that there are more characters in the series than Goku.

 Do any of the Furian (sp?) Powers from the Riddick universe break physics? I honestly don't remember too much of it not being able to have some kind of semi plausible explanation 




 Bender would get too lazy to fight,  more than likely. Remember that he isn't motivated go do much of anything,  unless it is for him. 

The Joker could probably use Bender's alcohol dependency to lure him into some kind of trap related to vaporizing Bender or making robots obsolete. 

Overall, I would say Bender at 7.5/10 because he would recognize when he is being conned, and he is also a frickin robot, so he would likely use any of the million or so things he's pulled out of his body/ass to kill the Joker.

Thought: in the episode of Futurama where the electromagnetic cosmic abnormality opens, Bender literally shits bricks as an act of fear. So he could be scared, shit bricks, and then kill Joker with those. 

Crime: They'd probably rob a super sized bank, and then Joker would burn the money because he is fuckin insane. 




 Question: is Superman Prime allowed? Because if so, throw everything out of the window, Prime will just rewrite the entire scenario to make himself because he is a dick slinging Superman like that 




 Probably Atom Ant. He would likely become molecularly unstable (my guess) due to the sheer size increase, and he also would not be able to avoid detection in any situation that his ant size is considered favorable. While he would still retain his super speed, flight, and super strength, he would lose that stealth factor that I mentioned earlier in this post.

Tl; Dr: Atom Ant doesn't get to be sneaky 




 I see the Neo Tri - Beam being brought up as Tien's only hope, but the problem with that would be that more than likely, Frieza would survive, if even a little, and recover before Tien would be able to defend himself again due to the toll on his body, resulting in Frieza walking to Tien's body and finishing him, Mortal Kombat style, because fuck that guy for challenging the former supreme ruler of the known universe, Lord Frieza. 




 There are so many re rolls happening right now, just on the sheer account of feeling too godly in the first fight. Example: Nanite Reality,  aka, Reality Warping. Not fair at all in my honest opinion

 I can understand how they would together (one can believe in a higher power that helps them feel comfort in their insecurities, and at the same time, be used as an exaplanatory gap for things science hasn't yet confirmed/refuted, and be able to practice science properly) I used to think that science and religion had to be separate, especially with the theory of evolution/Creationism, but I have seen, since about 2 years ago, that science and religion can coexist, until one starts interfering with the exercise of the other (Ken Ham's Young Earth Creationism/ atheists who believe that religion being around science will stupify the minds involved) 




 People who use bad gym etiquette; examples range from not cleaning up after oneself, or just standing around talking in an area where I need to be for an exercise, such as people who gather either around a set of dumbbells I would like to use or all around the squat rack.

How much of what my recruiters push is complete bullshit (they aren't focused on me getting an education, but rather they keep trying to push the possible high salary that can come with being a nuclear engineer?

 "Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora!"

That is the cry of Star Platinum trying as hard as he can to protect Jotaro from the swarm. I want to believe that with the power of precise movements and the urges of Stand master preservation,  Star Platinum would fend off all the bees, but I do not think he could move fast enough to protect Jotaro from a swarm of the bees stinging him. Maybe they could do the heart stop thing to prevent blood flow so the venom doesn't circulate while it gets separated from the blood cells and removed from the body,  but I doubt that would even work.

 Generally, the chapters that haze are becoming more and more of the minority amongst Greek Life as a whole. Honestly, there are other ways of building the bonds between members that will last a lifetime. Personally, spending time around all of my fellow brothers doing things like catching dinner or even hanging out playing Xbox (not stereotypical CoD or sports) makes me feel like we are all connected beyond our memberships in our respective chapters. 

I do not have any hazing experiences myself, as I'm not big on hazing people, and there wasn't really any type of initiation requirement or anything of that sort that could be considered hazing, within the wordings of both public perception and our National Fraternal Constitution.

 Alucard (Hellsing) vs Wolverine (Marvel)

1. In character, both of them would likely fight, since Wolverine as a mutant would likely be someone Alucard would hunt. I feel like most rounds would be a contest of Alucard's souls vs Wolverine's healing factor. I would give the victory to Alucard's souls and vamperic powers. Alucard 6.5/10

2. Bloodlusted: if Wolverine can chop off Alucard's head and rip out his heart on a speedblitz, then Wolverine would win (odds are about 4/10, IMO) More than likely, Alucard would go level 0 and Wolverine's healing factor would not be able to keep up with the sheer amount of injuries he would suffer. Alucard 6/10.

3. Prep: Wolverine would know what to do to actually kill Alucard, and Alucard would know how to beat adamantium skeletons and healing factor, but I would give this to Wolverine 6/10, because I think prep helps Wolverine more than it would Alucard

 I lived in Missouri, but am now in Indiana.

For Missouri,  we would just smoke a bunch of meth and go berserk.

 That was my exact reference.  




 Adam West portrayed Batman in the 1960s 





























 As the titles implies,  I made an agreement with a friend. Basically, he is not going to drink for a month if I don't smoke for a month. I made a joke in a conversation and now this is a serious thing. 




 The character customization in Tactics was really enioyable 




 Holy -expletive- the music is gripping and beautiful. Is it an original production or taken from a classical piece

 Give Goku Batman's preptime abilities and overall intelligence. That would be a fun what if, like what if Goku suddenly has an IQ of 1000 and can come up with better plans than "we need to hit this thing really hard"

Edit: he could beat Superman in that chili cook off posted earlier 




 This is a matter of preptime. I've heard and seen they are both ridiculous at it (beware of circle jerkers). 

Round 1: both get a week of preptime to figure out how to appease the hunger of Galactus.

Round 2: both get 6 months to figure out how to take down a higher tiered member of a different universe. (Loki vs Superman, Batman vs Thor)

Round 3: both get 5 years to prepare a contingency for something that they should not/cannot do by themselves. Situations are Loki vs Darkseid and Batman vs Thanos.

Bonus 1: The two fight to incap, no prep. (Bats doesn't kill in character)

Bonus 2: one month prep, fight to kill (bloodlusted)

 I don't get any rashes or such. I usually just sneeze if there is too much smoke around,  so it could just be that 




 *you're 
And does that actually make a difference? 
Also sorry I'm an asshole 




 It seems ridiculous, but almost every time I smoke, I start sneezing and getting watery eyes (like allergies, not the natural bloodshot). I would think that you could since you could technically be allergic to anything since it depends on the body's reaction (despite most of the wonderful highs I've had over the years)

 Anecdotal evidence follows: 
Marijuana can provide a psychological dependence, rather than a physical one (like, you will mentally crave it rather than physically) and this can be just as addictive and difficult to break as a physical dependence. One of the biggest signs to determine if someone is addicted to marijuana is to check their spending habits. If they are sacrificing necessities for weed, then you have an addict on your hands. 

Hell, anything can become an addiction if it fucks up the rest of your life enough  




 People always give me shit for casually smoking mids  (I break out dank for get togethers  and special occasions) 
The way I look at it I may have to smoke a little more, but I get a half of mids for the same price I get an eighth of dank.

 Alcohol: I hold conversations like a normal person when buzzed (not drunk). Drunk me is fun though.

Weed: This world is too serious, sometimes. I unwind after the competition and rush of everyday life. 

Benzos: Rare, but usually only when I need something done or my social retardation goes into overdrive.

Psychedelics: I like to see things from a different point of view, especially when it is something through my own senses.

Mdma: When I want to party and enjoy myself, but I don't want to drink. Better than alcohol honestly, just less socially acceptable.

Snoop Dogg: creates peaceful hip hop, moves to reggae, smoking weed the whole time. Then, he develops edgier music that culminates into songs about smoking, and a general disregard for the law. Point: dudes still smoking weed either way.

Behemoth: multiple lineup changes, lead singer gets and ungets leukemia, and the music is still metal as fuck either way. Mostly the same back and forth for me.

 It's a comfort thing personally. Most people shouldn't be dicks about it, but for those who are, you might have to talk your way through it. Personally, every one who I do MDMA, or Molly even, around knows I do so they aren't too worried about it 




 He would be my ace over basically every other ace in existence. 




 Not feeling the bar so I decided to come home and put on some music . 




 My friends always seem to pull me aside whenever my pupils are dilated.  




 How's it treating you right now 




 Eyes are some of the most fascinating looking things around. My only complaint is that every substance I do or take seems to alter them, and make them a clear giveaway that "I'm on something.' I love the look of my eyes when i'm on certain substances,  but I wish I could find things to do that either wouldn't make my eyes extremely bloodshot or make my pupils dilate to the size of dimes.

Marijuana = bloodshot, 'lowered' eyes 
MDMA/Molly/MDA = Dilated eyes
25i/25c = Dilated eyes
Cocaine = Dilated eyes
Alcohol = I don't look at my eyes when I'm  drunk.
LSD = Dilated Eyes
Adderall = Dilated eyes
Benzos = I don't fuck with em much. I have an addictive personality. 




 One is an extreme anti drug hypocrite who would ruin it, and the other would likely either try to get me fired from my job or ruin my social life  




 Dude I know the feeling. I'm going to a decent get together this weekend (about 50 people) and I'm avoiding acid strictly because of two people who I refuse to trip around 




 Would that festival happen to be Coachella? 




 If I could teach them how to ride a high, or get them to take a tolerance break, then they wouldn't need as much weed. I took a 2 week break (went from almost an eighth a day to 2 hits) and the high honestly felt more genuine for me 




 Yea but it's kinda my fault for being irresponsible with my smoke and finances in the past 




 Life only has as much value as you want it to have, and most people aren't going to care what you do one way or another 




 I know OP in real life. Some of our other friends were wanting to see if I wanted to buy weed for me so they could smoke it. OP and the girl did their own thing, and I had another friend come pick me up. 

Edit: the plan we for me to buy an eighth and then smoke them out. Knowing these guys, they would smoke the whole eighth, and I don't exactly have $50 a night to drop 




 I use the term safeties, others use the term trip sitters. Basically to make sure you don't freak out or put yourself or others in harm's way 




 Context: I tripped with a couple of friends last night, but I left because some others in the group were trying to get me to buy weed so they could smoke it. I had another friend come pick me up to be my safety. I couldn't explain to him what kind of vibe I was looking for (words were hard) and he tried his hardest to set up a good vibe. So I wound up watching Deadman Wonderland and taking breaks to look into the mirror. Basically, I had an awesome trip, but but I wish I could let people know how to be the best safeties they can be.

Edit: Safeties = Trip Sitters  




 I'm glad you enjoyed your night bro. Sorry I had to split. I started getting a peer pressure vibe off the guys to buy weed.  




 An eighth of weed, 2 mg Xanax, and 800 micrograms of 25i. Does that sound like a good idea?

 My shift in friends showed me this actually. Some people used to compete to see who would stay in the circle the longest. Now, with my current friends, we can smoke a joint between 4 or 5 people and all be functional. Might be the difference between being a functional stoner and being a couch lock stoner 




 I have friends who will smoke blunt after blunt after bowl after joint. They'll all get high but no one wants to be the first guy out. I must be the weirdo because I catch my buzz, acknowledge I'm good, and go about my day. It's the difference between a stoner with a routine and ambition and one who would rather smoke as much as they can and tell stories about it 




 I'm glad I can measure out each hour of my high based on how many 1 hitters I want to pack. 




 Tl:Dr. Alcoholic friend lectures me on doing coke once, fails to see hypocrisy in choices.

So last night, I went to hang out with some friends I hadn't seen in a while  (I transferred colleges). One of them had caught wind that I did coke within the past week, and gave me a huge lecture on how I'm not on the right path, how my life will be ruined, and all that jazz. I'm just venting a bit because I did it once (no redose, no urge to do it again) yet my friend is an alcoholic who will be drunk almost every day of the week  (they have about 20 empty handles of Fireball whiskey on display in their kitchen). One friend won't even acknowledge my presence anywhere anymore, and the third guy is cool, and knows I actually have my shit together. So yea, I hate word of mouth and the warped views of addiction people have. Yes, drugs can ruin your life. No, I don't believe you can be hooked on substances after one use.

Said friend is like "yeah, I chew, I drink, I even smoke pot on occassion, but that hard shit will ruin your life." Well, at least this friend has stopped being anti-marijuana

Edit: Removed some phrasing that made me come off worse than intended. 

2nd edit: The friend who wasn't acknowledging my presence has been a bit reserved about things lately, and I was told something else was probably on his mind. I feel like an ass. 




 So we needed a study to tell people to not be total dicks about someone's weight to their face? 




 Dumb bitch deserved that 




 MDMA makes it hard for me to be social because an overexcited, mildly off putting, really loud, 6'4" 240 lb. male is kind of hard for people to deal with. One time, I went out to a club to go dance. Instead, I talked to people as they were coming in by the cover charge place (because I don't have a better name for it)

When I trip, I love anime. Something about Asian artwork entices me. The last time I tripped, I finished watching the arc of Hajime No Ippo I was on, and getting caught up on season 3 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 




 I haven't seen as much use out of women personally. Most of them I know tend to just drink with their friends, and maybe a quarter of that group will smoke on occassion. I think it's like 5 or 6, at the most, that I know for a fact they have done something more recreational  (MDMA, LSD, shrooms)
    
Almost every guy I know drinks or smokes. A decent amount have done coke, shrooms, acid, what have you. I can find a guy to be a safety, or to do the substance with me, much easier than I can a woman.
    
Though I have seen more women be around prescription pills than men.

 I still work across from one. Sometimes their music seeps across, past the phone kiosk in the middle where the ladies working there have a Macbook on loud blaring Drake, past the speakers we have blaring Rush, Led Zeppelin, and other classics, and into my unfortunate ears. 

One girl I know and am friends with will claim that Bring me the Horizon is better than anything I listen to. Sure I've gone through phases of shitty music tastes, but this is worse than what I used to listen to. I will list my musical experiences in a different comment if anyone is interested, so they can see my frame of reference.

That last paragraph was intended to sound incredibly pretentious.

But for real; the only enhancement I have seen that would even matter is having Cap's  shield to possibly block Mjolnir's strikes. Otherwise I'm feeling all levels of a Thor stomp, simply because of the tier system alone

 Legal: water during, one half of my multi vitamin before bed, maybe some light food. Ibuprofen, more water and White Castle the day of hangover. I will also take the other half of my multi (it's 2 pills once a day, but if I split it up, my body absorbs the nutrients better)

Illegal: Wake and bake.  




 Yeah I've noticed my appetite does weird things when I smoke frequently or take breaks and such. Like, when I smoke a lot, I'll only be able to eat when I'm high,  but I still won't eat too terribly much. When I'm on break, I won't hardly eat for about 2 or 3 days, then I'll go back to eating about like normal

 That really is adorable. Deal with meth heads who will take refrigerators and copper wire and tools and scrap them for a fix. That is the bad end of the drug world  




 Ah I like the insight and removal from my depressive cycles. The last time I did acid I tried to eat something simple and puked it back up. I decided that unhealthy foods were the enemy and have dropped 20 lbs since that trip (about 2 months ago) 




 I've got a bit of understanding I guess from the fact that my brother loves his occasional meth, frequent spice, and even more frequent weed smoke. I prefer the psychedelics because it let's me go on an adventure within my own mind. He hates psychs because he can't function or do what he wants while he is on them. I guess it is a difference in wanting to control the effects 




 My first time being high I was baked for about 4 hours and just played Mario Kart the whole time. You will have a longer duration due to the fact that the receptors in your brain that are affected by THC have had zero training to deal with it 




 I have the luxury of having a light school and work schedule so I can take the day or 2 it takes to adjust my sleep cycle to complete sobriety.  




 I'm planning on getting my degree in Psychology then getting my MBA so I can move into HR management. Then I will be able to help find the good candidates who may otherwise fail drug tests and try to be understanding toward that to the fullest of my ability

 I'm pro education and harm reduction. I try to help those around me. But if you put anything that you do on social media, then that is your dumb fault for doing so and all consequences are to be expected, unfortunately. Sorry if that came out a little crude

Round 1: Is there anyone who can enter the simulated world and beat him, or is he like TOAA?   

Round 2: Outside the simulation and in powersuit.

I chose to not include a non powersuit, outside of simulation round because he is a regular human with guns otherwise.

Bonus: Would there be a tier change if followers were added?

Edit: Added in actual rounds and clarification 




 The fact that there is a sign means that someone has done this before

 My depression is usually brought on by either long term smoking or eating a bunch of junk. Because I can smoke out one night, and feel like crap the next day.  




 The last time I did shrooms, I sat around and laughed at most everything for about 5 hours. 




 I've been looking forward to this since I finished high school  ('12) and it's finally happening. If I don't find some friends to split the PPV cost with, I'll wind up going to the bar 




 Weed puts me in a depressive funk.    
LSD makes me appreciative of being alive,  despite the issues I've had while tripping.   
Shrooms chill me out.   
Cocaine makes me want to fight and be on edge.   
Opiates make me sleepy and about knock me out.

 In a different way. I felt myself dissociated and as if I had multiple personalities the last time I tripped. I really felt like I learned a lot both about myself and my relation with others through the experience 




 Oh good point. Did not think I would have to state that sex was consensual 




 I have been drugged, thus I can survive being drugged.   
I have been shot, thus I am immune to most small arms.

I have been tazed and wasn't injured, so I am now immune to being electrocuted.

 Forgetting this exists. Also, vanishing/wandering off 




 I wandered off 




 I just sort of wondered off, Towelie style 




 It's not like it was Peeta  bread 




 Squawk 




 It was some generic wheat bread. Not bad but stale. 0/10 when sober 




 Well, I got super hungry, and the bread was being thrown at me. Me, being incredibly lazy, decided not to get up to get actual food but to eat bread being thrown at me

 Lines of coke and molly at the same time. Kills the roll, absolutely stupid, but I smoked and drank enough to do it. Had 4mg Xanax as well. Ended up sleeping tied to a tree, was not arrested or anything. Lost my whole weekend starting from Thursday

 What is everyone's drug plans for the holiday? Mostly for those who don't have dates I guess because I figured most of the couples would either be sober or smoking weed/rolling on MDMA. 




 I love the TPB reference in the story

 No. You weren't.  




 This winter has been my worst on cardio in a while. When I was in high school, I had sports, so cardio wasn't something I needed to conciously seek. I always had a gym buddy who would help talk me through actually getting on a treadmill or eliptical (I hate stationary cardio) and now that he moved further north, I've been slacking on cardio. I want to be able to run outside instead (easier on my knees) but whenever the average daily temperature is less than 20 degrees Fahrenheit, it gets too cold to run

 I love the second idea personally. The first one might cause too much anxiety out and about that can't easily he fixed in your own home  




 You might not get z's though. Deep relaxing breaths

 The way I understand it is that you become the anti-stereotype. Like, most people picture drug addicts as "burnouts" who "provide little to no meaningful contributions" to society. You would embrace and become the opposite of this, and show that the worth of the person cannot be connected to the substances that they use 




 I have a couple strategies depending on the substance in question.

1) Do so much of it that you show yourself moderation is the best way to handle it (me with drinking)

2) Don't ever carry anymore in your stash than you're willing to go through in 1 or 2 nights. Pre-plan dosages accordingly

3) Occupy your time with something else. When I'm saving something for the night,  I'll keep myself busy throughout the day. Doesn't have to be labor filled or stressful, just something.to occupy the time. 




 I'm glad you asked because I'm doing this combo after I take my drug test on Monday 




 You have a beautiful voice, and I'm glad you survived to share it with us. 




 Right. Like; I paid for my college out of pocket this semester without loans, I've never been late to work or had to call out, and I'm probably moving into my own place sometime in the next few months.  




 But my problem is that I like to talk about my experiences. It got me in trouble the last time I was on coke.  




 My sleep has become episodic and comes only slightly; but always with weirdly vivid dreams that I can remember for about a half hour or so. Sometimes, my dreams will connect like short episodes of a mini series. 

Some of these involve drug use, and the substance will remain in my mind with an urge to do it for most of the next day. It changes based on dreams. My dream was that I was zoned out, alone, nodded with a glass pipe on the table, and no cares in the world. I may not always know what substance is in the dream, but I feel like I am altered in dream.

Drugs that have shown up: Weed, LSD, Molly, Crack, Meth, Peyote, Ayahusca, Cocaine, and one random dream about dying and being reincarnated on Ibogaine 




 What drug(s) would you do if you didn't have to deal with associated stigmas? Like, most people in my demographic don't give a shit if I smoke weed or experiment with psychedelics. Or, even on an employment stigma basis? Or am I just too worried about keeping with what little friend group I have left?

 You are a wonderful gift to your family and friends  




 And there is an Alzheimers study involving mice on the Frontpage and I will say the same thought now that I had there. When will any of this become available for human trial? 




 You're correct in that I was looking for something to blame, and that I should have paced myself better. However, I'm not blaming the Vyvanse. I'm blaming my impulsive nature and reckless tendency to not cut myself off or even really know when to do so. 




 I've read too many benzo blackout stories. Didn't think amphetamines would do about the same.  




 Yeah it'll become another good story, like the time I tried to smoke a pickaxe like it was a hookah, or the night I almost died.  




 The only positive I have right now was that I wasn't told I could never go back over there, but I am no longer allowed to drink there. Waiting to hear back from the other person living there.  




 Never again. One or the other likely. Both together? Hell the fuck no. I'm pretty sure I tanked a good friendship and a good chunk of my social standing. I was told about what had happened last night. Basically, I Pissed on the carpet and puked a lot at said friends place. So again, never bringing this combo back into my life.

Edit: One roommate was like "yeah, train_subject2252, you might want to cut back on drinking for a while" and the other said "Just bring some weed the next time you're over. Oh, and still don't drink here again." 




 They have one, I believe,  that used to be used on alcoholics. It basically rewired their chemistry to where the person in question would forcibly vomit if they drank even 1 beer. I'm gonna go check for a source

 How do you feel about A Serbian Film? 




 Weed: Curiosity and a friend had it.     

Once I realized one time wouldn't get me addicted and I wasn't ruining my life, I started using other substances mostly to see what they were like, and a shameful time or two of trying to be cool and edgy 




 I've got a couple for this:

1) One of the first times I ever did acid, I wound up driving myself home after everyone else started to pass out. I expected my roommate at the time to be asleep or at his lady friend's place. Such was not the case, and my roommate asked if I was on drugs or something (anti-drug fellow) I also had a lofted bed at the time so I just told him I was drunk, grabbed my pillow and blanket off my bed and slept on the floor. So there's my fail.   

2) My success is basically everyday, between taking phone calls and planning arrangements drunk as fuck if I don't have to be somewhere or high as fuck if the day of the week ends in Y

 




 I haven't been outside the U.S. so I can't say for certain, but I figured it would apply to most developed countries.

 Agreed. I have my gun time. I have my drug time. These two don't meet, unless it's an open field and a case of beer....gotta get new targets somehow 




 I love the sentiment and fully agree. But I actually am in full control of my life, what I'm doing, and I have a strong vision laid out for my next few years 




 Funny you mention that. I actually have some saved back  




 True. Mine is also out in the country a ways so I don't have to worry about that 




 I love night trips as well, it's just being able to be outside without all the weird glares and looks is refreshing. Also, it's sunny and 60, after months of well...not being that. What's not to love?

I took 2 hits of some good acid about 3 hours ago, and I like where this trip is heading, mainly because I'm the pilot of my own journey, and not being led along.

I also feel more calm and centered compared to other trips, and I actually feel like I'm doing something with my day off.

I just wanted to put words in this box.

 I think you're recommendation at the 150-220 is a little high for some people on their first time. I'd keep it between 100-150 personally. Also some people have different thresholds when it comes to 'tripping'.

 Last Wednesday, I did a .3 of MDMA and settled into listening to some music. I was enjoying myself, immersed in my peak, until I heard a loud knock on the door. I couldn't answer it since I would not have been able to hold a conversation. So, my parents wind up being forcefully woken up, and there was an officer at the door who brought my brother home. It turned out that he fell asleep at the wheel and ran off the road. I found out the next day that my brother blew a .05 and he had snorted 5 Loritab (his words) and then I told him my situation and how scared I was that there was a cop in my house while I was rolling. He laughed it off and was thankful he wasn't taken to jail. 

Now I ask, what drug experience led to your biggest anxiety attack?

 I remember whenever my cousin got out of rehab, he had to get his wisdom teeth cut out, and he said afterward the only thing they were allowed to give him was a little sedative for the operation and a higher dose ibuprofen.

 Worst stoner ever, The Intercept:   

Okay, so a group of about 4 of us rolled up a couple blunts to smoke around before watching some Blue Mountain State. Everything is about normal, until one of the other guys (Intercept) goes to get water. He comes back, and instead of sitting in his chair, he walks over, grabs the blunt out of rotation, calls it an "interception" and proceeds to hit it...and hit it....and hit it. I have not smoked with this friend since because that completely ruined the circle. Even if it wasn't my weed in the blunt (mine was in the other one) that's still a shitty move. After that, I grab my weed and blunt, and leave,  saying I had somewhere to be. I've seen him do this with hookahs as well, and no one calls him out on it. Nice guy, just...that moment left a bad vibe on my [6]

My other one is the Storyteller:   

This was a couple years ago. I had a bowl packed and going around, and it was smoked. Highness was felt. Then my friend at the time packed a bowl and passed it around. About midway through the second bowl, my friend starts telling a story, and goes on for about 15 minutes (I looked at my phone clock) without taking a hit or passing it. So, I ask whenever there is a break in the story if he is going to pass the bowl. His response went a little something like this: It's my fucking weed, don't be a mooching cock sucker, I'll tell a goddamn story if I fucking feel like it, and if you don't like it, then you take your dumbass home and don't bother me again. Other people were visibly bothered by his drawn out, retold stories, but I decided I'd be the one to nicely say something. As a result, I do not smoke with this friend. 


I noticed in general my smoking circle has shrunk a lot, but the people who hit me up for stuff is rising. Also I have no problem with people telling stories, it's just whenever you're story is drawn out and there is a perfectly good bowl not being touched by anyone because one person is holding up the circle. I understand finishing your thought then taking a hit, because that is how I tell stories when stoned.

 Can Jules Winfield (Pulp Fiction ) stop Stone Cold Steve Austin (WWF/WWE) from saying what? 




 WHAT? 




 Based on what the chart bot showed me, I would attract a hookah smoking, drug using, bong ripping, comic book loving metal head who likes kittens. So basically, half the dudes on Reddit. 




 Not a single bit of love for Lars Ulrich? Or are we not allowed to like Metallica? 









 I tried to take off the top piece of a Kaloud Lotus without using the handle...I got 2nd degree burns on my hand after that one  




 Is that a horizontal diffuser? Also, I love the MP5 family! 




 Primus did the theme song for South Park 




 Smoking weed, making straight A's, living in my brothers shadow for a while, and some people thought I tried too hard

Buy tabs, go on adventures.      
Buy a Thunderbird, drive around.   
Implant titanium in my bones, be knockoff Wolverine.  
Live off Thai food.  
Buy toilet paper, stock up and resell during winter storms.     
Buy thermite, become the next Michael Bay.  
Buy everything else in the future as a technicality or theoretical expense.   




 Love the suggestions. Listening to John Williams though  




 Spring Awakening June 12-14, Soldier Fielf. Chicago, Illinois  




 Day 5: don't do them together. Coke kills MDMA rolls 




 $2700 at the most 




 Use a reagent kit. Seriously I've been sold meth and shit before, per my symptoms lining up with Erowid experiences. Don't trust it 




 Weed was for depression/anxiety.  
I took any pain pills I could find for my messed up back.  
MDMA gives me that open ability to talk about my life. 




 Officially diagnosed twice with Asperger's here. I can't talk to people well on a lot of things. Shrooms mellow me. LSD apparently turns me into a pretentious asshole  




 Update: loving the vibes. Had another friend suggest extra music so I should be good for most of the roll 




 I want to rip my bong sooooooooooooooo bad but I have a job interview Friday and a likely drug test next week. Haven't smoked in almost 2 weeks. It just feels like forever and my dreams have been weird. 




 I feel like this is every stereotypical stoners argument ever 
























 Voice leading can be the reason for almost anything 




 I get something like this when I smoke inside then go outside. Everything outdoors will appear more interesting, and I'll almost have a twilight kind of vision,  where the daylight is slightly dulled and the nightlight is more colorful 




 True for my location. When I worked overnights at Walmart, everyone was on something at some point in the night, and they gave you an hour lunch break. For me, this became a routine: smoke a bowl, eat lunch, smoke another bowl, smoke a cig, febreeze clothes (I don't like smelling like weed in public, even if it is Walmart) and return to my monotonous job 




 Mr. Sanders,

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read over and answer some of our questions. I would almost consider this AMA a more modernized, albeit, less face to face, version of a town hall meeting. 
    
With that in mind, I am wondering what other communication styles you had planned, what with trying to get a forward thinking campaign moving under a third party banner. Do you feel that there are extra obstacles to be cleared because of your status as a third party candidate, and how do you plan on handling said obstacles? 




 I know what that's like. Except with too powerful of stimulants, I get on edge and quick to anger, which isn't helpful on a big frame and a short temper.  




 /r/tautology 




 Well; I mean, I still do 




 Panem et circenses 




 Raining Blood in my ass 




 I'm not gonna lie to her about it. But obviously enough, I'm not going to be fucked up around her  




 I got her to watch The Culture High a couple months back, so I might have started to get her to think a bit about it, but I'm not going to say for sure 




 Honesty is one of my big things. I don't care what you do (to an extent) just don't lie to me about it 




 Honesty was basically my entire selling point. I'm not the best looking or always the nicest, sweetest, or most eloquent, but at least I won't lie to her 




 She doesn't seem like the type to do so. And I have other habits that are frowned upon moreso than smoking weed.  




 As the title goes, I thought I found a girl who I would have been dating, but I found her apparent deal-breaker: she thinks it's the worst thing ever to smoke pot, yet she tried to claim that she supports medical marijuana.     

I then explained the differences in weed in illegal states, adding that we can't have dispensaries around, so it is difficult to find low THC, high CBD strains in decent quantity or frequency.     

She then sent me a message telling me her last boyfriend apparently lied to her about smoking. My thought is that if I'm honest with it, it won't be an issue.   

 Edit: I've seen all of the honesty related comments. I don't lie to people I care about.

The issue might be (if you look into my post history) I like drug use. So I might just be marking another girl off the already short "girls who are interested in me" list. Yes this is whiny. No, I don't really care right now.

I wanted to hear the subs thoughts.

Bonus: I forgot I asked her to watch The Culture High a couple months back, which she followed through on. So, I guess I made a little progress.. 




 The recommendation seems skewed a little high. I roll hard off of 300mg. The recommended dose for my weight (240) as 540mg. That's over half a gram!

Edit: recommended dose is actually 245mg, which is close to my normal range. I had my weight in kg instead of lb

 You shouldn't call a black man a nigger, not when there are other options that are less used. I want to call that coon a jigaboo some days, and I might call that jungle bunny a porch monkey on others.  




 Hahaha the first time I got caught was the first time I saw a phone go through a TV. She ordered a new one and apologized the next day for her reaction. I was on Christmas break and decided to smoke some with a couple friends. My mom thought it was because of the people I was hanging out with. It was quite the opposite: I liked to smoke and I had the money, so I bought the weed and was repaid in gas, munchies, and ways to pass the time. I also sold to another group in very small amounts (my biggest sale in high school was a quad) and was making my own decisions and such.

Today, my parents know that I smoke; but I haven't tried to show them the reasoning. They refuse to talk about it. Remember, a phone went through a TV. They don't call me out on it or cause trouble because I look and act like a functioning young adult, unlike my brother.  I work, I go to school, and I have ambition. 

My dad has told me several times about how he has been around people who smoked but never smoked with them. He said he isn't a fan of the smell, but I once saw his face light up in happiness over my mom picking up lunchmeat. His eyes were bright red and he had "the grin" so I'm convinced he has smoked before, and still might on the down low. I've smoked with a few of his close friends, so I know they're not too worried about it.

My mom is the opposite. She has never done a drug in her life recreationally (she keeps her Vyvanse locked in her cabinet and takes only the prescribed amount) except for cigarettes and caffeine, if you want to get anal about it. She is an ER nurse, and with that,  I understand why she is against drug use in general. She sees the worst outlooks on a daily basis: ODs, kids (15-19) losing out on a long life, just the generally crippling effects of being lost to an uncontrollable addiction. 




 You will not take Sammy Davis Jr. from me!!! 




 That thumbnail has too uncomfortable of a resemblance to Joe Biden for my tastes  




 Well I saw the three faces looking at the moon as I gazed on. One demonic, the other two unlike it. As if I were forced to decide which one to trust  




 /r/bestof 




 /r/bestof 




 Because I don't fully understand what constitutes it. Yes, it is supposed to be a transcendental/profound experience, but I always understood that as a religious context. Also I could tell myself that I am in the middle of a trip still  




 Part 1.   

So at about 9 pm last night, I took a tab of acid, and let it do its work. The visuals weren't too intense but the feel goods and body vibes were beautiful. This lasted from roughly 10-1. I decided to have a smoke sesh, which created part 2 of the trip.    

Part 2.   

After this; I went into full trip mode, and laid in my backyard for 2 hours. It was dark, but the full moon made it look like it was daylight. Everything looked like it was a twilight time of day, and there was so much depth to the horizon. I could see designs and figures in the clouds. Weird enough, I saw 3 demonic faces staring into the moon, and I stared into it all. Once I could move, I entered one of the most intense and euphoric meditative trances in my life. I sat and I contemplated as much as I could, but I can only recall pieces at this time. I wound up falling asleep at sometime when my mind finally decided to give up from overload.

Rating.  

Part 1: ++ (I could still hold a full conversation with my mother)   

Part 2: +++ (I will not assign one of my own experiences as a ++++, but this is the closest I feel I have ever been to it) 














 I love how hip hop oriented this list is. I just got into Schoolboy Q and haven't had any complaints at this point. I started hearing songs from Habits and Contradictions at parties I'd go to; and it just stuck from there  




 At least I can do a good Dr. House walk now 




 Good word 




 I wish I had some. But none of my people deliver. At least I'll have a script for something by torrow evening 




 Hasn't helped at all in the past 24 hours 




 Never had it before 




 The first three have not helped so far. I'm heading to the er tomorrow to see what my options are. I already have prior back issues on record (scoliosis and nerve pain)  




 I totaled my car last night. I lost control coming home from a party, and struck an electric pole. I was sober that evening (blew a .00 and passed all assessments) I now have no vehicle to drive, and my mother refuses to take me to the ER. I'm going to get my brother to take me after work. Is there anything I can do to help deal with this pain? If not, that's fine. I'll put down an ice pack and take some Ambien. I just needed to vent. I already have a messed up back, and this did not help. 




 I'm going to ask the important question: how is it so far? 




 I cannot disagree with that statement. As I Lay Dying was huge when I was in high school 




 Rae Sremmurd- No Type.   

Any of my super angsty/metal core music.   

I'll remember more later 




 This is a pleasant surprise 




 And Lambesis is also in jail for murder. There is no point to this comment 




 My dial up days are hazy but one I remember happened about 10 years ago. I Google searched the words pornography and pornstar trying to watch port on my mom's computer. That was the day I learned about clearing Internet history 




 Victor Von Doom won't have any of your insolence! 




 She brought it on herself you know 




 Is this the Reddit account of Stephen A. Smith? 




 So you loved Norma Jeane, yes? 




 Smith? 




 I want to know how he is doing  




 Is there anything about Kevin? 




 Fruition?  




 You know it's a British source whenever they claim something to be rubbish. Also the .UK domain helps 




 The scene explicitly shows him kicking the midget. Like, moving his legs without assistance to do so

Edit: Is dwarf or little person a more APPROPRIATE term 









 Another user linked images of the City Museum in St. Louis. That is what you are looking for

 Scorecard should read 2-1, favor Seals. Double tap policy

 1300 as of now. Jaqlin and Pixie came quick 









 Mine had the opposite effect. I was at stage 840, and had just unlocked Mohacas when the app shut down. When I restarted the app, I was kicked back about 50 stages, but my highest stage shown was the previous 840 




 Mankind is made of the same building blocks as everything else we have discovered in our short history. Just a few basic molecules make up over 90% of the universe, yet there is so much diversity and beauty in our world. Life has found a place to flourish, amongst the rubble left from The Big Bang, and the results of the collisions of parts of said rubble. We are one planet, one pint sized, yet massive, grouping of molecular structures that has come together to create a collective life force‚Ä¶a drive, perhaps, to ‚Äúadvance‚Äù and ‚Äúevolve‚Äù as numerous and diverse of species possible. It seems reasonable that there would be at least one other place in the universe that has this same capacity, and it utilizing it far better than any species on Earth would be able to compromise. We live in a universe that we have mapped a very small percentage of, said universe is constantly expanding, and we have already found at least one other collection of debris that has the possibility of being able to house some form of life. Scientists discovered that Mars used to have oceans, and that these oceans were found frozen under the surface of Mars itself. By extension, would it be fair to reason that Mars could have possibly housed lives before we as a species ever gained the collective power to be able to observe events that are beyond our planetary scale?
    
This understanding has helped me figure out some of the Nirvana and oneness that I felt during my last acid trip. I didn‚Äôt think of it the way I had typed it there during my trip, though. During, I felt myself sink into the ground, and fall into the Earth. When I had laid back down on my blanket, I felt myself floating up into the stars, and becoming the Hubble Space Telescope, in that every image I saw was clear, beautiful, mystifying, and vivid, yet I could process this through a computer so powerful and perplexingly fast that nothing man has done thus far has even come close to the processing speed and mind blowing capabilities of said computer. I‚Äôm talking about the human brain, of course.
    
To close this, I leave you all with a fitting quote from a man much more educated than I. ‚ÄúWe are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.‚Äù -Neil DeGrasse Tyson

 At a [7] and this made me start bawling uncontrollably  









 I've noticed lately that I've become the source of drug related information for my friends (effects, dosage, and such) I figured it was because I try to explain things to the best of my abilities, going beyond "it'll get you fucked up." 

Does anyone else have a similar experience, and if so, tell me you use your position of knowledge responsibly? 




 The cumulative hangover will kill me 




 General smoking etiquette for me: 
Don't be a cunt.   
Don't be a dick.  
DO hold your hit for a couple seconds (if possible)   
Always enjoy yourself.   
Oh and don't forget: smoke some, but only if you're not going somewhere where you're expected to be perfectly sober. 




 Replace but with and on all of those 




 A friend of mine and I decided to make a tray of brownies and started cooking our weed. Everything was going great until we both left the kitchen, and wouldn't you know it, goddamn grease fire. I haven't seen the damage to the place yet, but he is currently in the ER with burns and such. 

If you're going to use vegetable oil or anything of the sort, be very observant and never leave it unattended.

Update: He has 3rd degree burns along his right wrist and right foot. Also; he is dealing with the pain like a champ. 




 Bleezy

[And Poison's Trans Status](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_\(Final_Fight\)#Censorship) 




  Me and my buddy have been playing Ultimate Street Fighter IV with random characters. He gets Poison and I get Dhalsim. After the match we realize that this is factual. On an LCD tv, we just played a trans woman beat up a Indian dude on Liquid Crystals.

 I'm on mobile so I can't easily link the thread but I saw one where the question was posed if Batman's Alfred was Sterling Archer's butler, and how things might have changed.

So now I'm curious, how would Batman's progression as both a person and superhero be altered if he were raised by Woodhouse instead of Alfred? 









 I already have trouble socializing sober, and it's even more difficult when tripping. Don't know how much used I'd be. 




 Brother is a Stims guy who love to fuck with paranoid people and can possible turn violent if he's tweaking and freaks out.

I am a psychs guy who gets easily freaked out in simple social situations and fall into my thoughts when I'm tripping.

Weird enough, we combine well when we've smoked enough and then do our drugs of choice. 




 Superman would be bribed away 10/10 for one simple thing.

Bulma's panties 




 It was hand grinder too. Does that mean it's not as good to snort  














 Okay so I binged. I had 3/4 of an ounce of weed, a 750ml of Captain Morgan, 10 xanax, and some morphine. I smoked a few bong bowls, then took 4 MG of Xanax.

I now have an entire weekend at Muncie Gras that I have no memory of, all my xanax is gone, there's some kief in my bag, morphine is also gone and so is my memory for the last 2 days. Wow.

And I had to get my car out of impound. 

Edit: wound up being about 12 or 15 bars missing. What the fuck?
 




 Chirp chirpp 




 I have a bong. And I've been dropping xanax bars like nothing. 8 mg in. Just wanted to let everyone known that time to yourself is wonderful. Also can I add morphine? 









 There was even a documentary about it a couple years back 




 Wrong state. Franklin County, MO is awful as well, bet it's mostly meth  




 Franklin County (assuming I'm thinking of the right one) brings back some memories. I lived in the county next to it, and trust me, I could see this stuff happening more and more as I was growing up: people falling into the wrong circles, getting hooked on substances, chasing highs. All in all, it's not worth it, but you can't really forget where you're from 




 You mean DXM lol. DMX just makes me want to smoke crack 




 It has boiled down to me having a lot of weed, a handful or two of xanax, and some morphine.  




 Made an edit 




 I have an undisclosed amount of money that was recently added to my bank account and about 3 days of down time before my new job starts. 

So, spending money is present, and time to recover is also present?

What should I binge on this weekend?

Edit: I have all my weed already purchased. I have about $400 I can spend. For the feeling, I want something where I can be social, and hyped up. Like I'm on top of the world without too much comedown. I don't need to feel lovey. 

Things I can get for sure: Xanax, various opiates (not touching H, personal preference) more weed, MDMA, shrooms, LSD, 25X series, Cocaine, Meth.

Anything else I should ask about? 




 This is how you would legalize weed in the South. Jesus did it, so should you, because that's what Jesus wants  




 Bonus: Majuub 




 That's one way to make it to the top 




 Then your dealer is in a car as well... 




 White people do as they please in this country. It's just a way of life 




 That is trippy and beautiful  




 And I have discovered something wondrous about me. Might just be the MDMA helping repressed thoughts 




 I discovered an entirely new thing I liked to do  









 On my current one right now, Candyflipping!! Just coming up on the Molly, wishing I had some weed though
