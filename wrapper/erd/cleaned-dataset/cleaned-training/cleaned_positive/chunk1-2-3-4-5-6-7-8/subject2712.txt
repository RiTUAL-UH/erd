 Idk what I could offer, but I do know my pirate name would be Tash Von Rapier ARRRRRRGGHGH 
























 I'm going to start by saying you are a perceptive 15 year old. When I was 15, all I cared about was Dragon Ball Z. 

She's definitely into you, but you shouldn't ask her to this dance. Let your friend do his thing.  




 I think of a lot of girls find awkwardness cute!  




 Amirite?  




 I'm just acting like I don't care, but I am ACTING. 




 It was okay. He's not a performer, so the show was bland.  




 see my reply to klocke 




 It wasn't like that lol. I just told her "hey, the logical side of my brain is telling me it's not okay for you to stay here after i leave." i meaaan, who let's a stranger stay at their place after they leave.  




 thanks. new.  




 nah. it was good for both parties for sure. if a couple orgasms i any indicator.  




 damn that's what i should have said. 




 I'm not saying she has a low self esteem b/c i'm projecting or b/c she fucked me. It's just in her body language, and just her general personality.

 I teach at a high school in China "Why do foreigners do it so much?" 




 They really are. The air quality teeters between hazardous and harmful from day to day, but we've been fortunate to have a couple hazardous days in a row!

 How does I guy choose which girl he wants. Do you guys just line up? That has to wear on the self esteem of the less attractive girls. 




 I interpret it as: 
Often improvement involves changing yourself to fit into society better, which makes simple people happy and calm.  Masturbation makes people happy and calm. Self destruction is not accepted in society, and is illogical, thus you are truly free. 

Also, it sounds cool.  









 I was just asked to do this. How weird do you feel afterwards?

 Binge eating is considered an eating disorder. 




 This is getting gross.

exactly what I am referring to. impossible.  




 Judging from your comments in other posts, you do exactly what you are telling StressCavity not to do. Sorry to call you out, but you are extremely obnoxious. Sorry. 




 lol 




 I've lived in various parts of China for many years, and I have never seen anyone eat a dog. It might be considered a delicacy, but contemporary China isn't into it. In general.  




 I took this in Beijing. In general, the Chinese don't eat dogs or cats.  




 "For a ruling party which follows Marxism...." China, you are more capitalistic than the US. 




 OP is a creep. 














 You're a better person than me.  




 Ha train_subject2712 is an inside joke. While you're banging a girl, you spin her around like a top. 

We have plans to meet, and flesh everything out. I will definitely have someone on call. Thanks for the helpful tips. 




 The guy that theorized about the Brown student earlier today. Are you santa? 




 False. I mean for people in general, that might be a god way to figure out if you are gay or not. Not you specifically. Defensive much? 
























 Living amongst them. The three things I noticed within the first twenty minutes after leaving the airport were 1) Traffic laws were a suggestion 2) Spitting and burping is appropriate behavior 3) Smoking is cool anywhere. Hotel lobbies, elevators, THE LOCKER ROOM AT MY GYM. After about 10 months here, I have accepted that they are relatively inconsiderate of others, they are loud, they pathologically break rules and laws, and I don't know how many times I've past a mom suspending her kid above the sidewalk to let the little guy do his business. Also, I live in Beijing, and I'm sure, no I know, it's gets worse the more rural you get. 
That being said, they have many other redeeming qualities. If you think you about what they've gone through in the last 70 years, it makes sense that their social etiquette hasn't caught up with their economic stature. 




 Seems like this thread's consensus is that Chinese and Brazilian tourists are especially bad. They are both rapidly developing nations, with the separation between the wealthy and impoverished expanding every year. Coincidence?    




 Not a staffer, but still. We shared a flight to Hong Kong with this weird Buddhist monk. He was in full garb, ran around the plane the whole time, had a girl voice, and rapidly flipped through magazines. He wound up staying in my room at a hostel. He also jacked off to gay porn in broad daylight while people were present and awake. We asked him why, and he said in Chinese "It doesn't count. They're white." 




 Also white in China. Rules and laws are only suggestions here. 




 I work in Beijing, and my students showed me this months ago! I think it's been a thing in China for awhile. FYI 




 The part about the goosebumps won't leave me.  




 Agreed. Not usually the case in China. South Korea on the other hand...

 My cousins taught me that if I wanted to dream about something specific, if I thought really hard about it the moments before I went to sleep, I would in fact dream about it. I said "Like I could be Michael Jordan in my dream?" and they said "Yeah! Or even be with a girl!"  




 I think he wants to have sex with you really bad.  




 you're totally right. learned it the hard way. i came off as defensive for sure. 




 I did today in front of the boss, and the annoying coworker was just like "You can't get personal in a professional setting." and I said "What. You want me to just call you out behind your back? Be you?" 




 I work at a high school in Beijing, and we send the kids out in hazardous/dangerous air quality conditions weekly.

 Do you teach independently, through a company, or at a school? If you teach through a school, which one? I teach at a public school here in Beijing, and I want to talk to you!  




 Thanks! I was just curious. I wasn't questioning if he manipulated her or not.  




 How did he manipulate her?

 I didn't get the nausea, but I felt off-balance and shaky for a good month or so. Drowsiness is still a problem though.  




 For me, I sleep incredibly deep on it. Like sleep through 8 alarms and be late to work six times in five months deep. 




 Is this a verified side-effect?  









 agreed. and they exist alongside religion. economics, "security", revenge, supremacy, racism, etc.

Plus, if you like it enough, you can just stay here and never pay your loans ever!
