 Can confirm; I have the same phone.

My one has a full 1gb free on its SD card, but keeps tricking itself into thinking it's full, blocking messages coming in and stopping me from using Facebook and the like. I would probably get more use out of a slice of cheese some days. 









 Hey,guys. 

I recently read the post on r/askreddit about advice for writing and realised that I may have been pretty lazy in my writing so far, so I was wondering if anyone could tell me how sloppy my writing has gotten and also give any general feedback on mood/characterisation. It's at ~15,000 words at the moment, so I'm about 6 or so chapters in.

Thanks in advance :D

 Can I come,too? 




 But there's.....p-people there. Real people. I don't think I can cope with all those people who aren't me walking around.  




 Is an Australian Shepherd another name for a Coolie? That dog looks a hell of a lot like a Coolie. 




 A man goes to pass some arse-turnips,but realises there's no toilet paper. He is also on a bus. 




 I'll try to get my hands on some, I know he has a few floating around somewhere. 




 Proof to him working on the Matrix. Figured I might as well try to get some semblance of legitimacy to my claim. I can't prove that that is actually my dad without revealing too much personal information, so you're gonna have to take my word for it. Given that this is the internet, I'm not surprised if you don't believe me. 




 Didn't stop him from kicking in a wardrobe on set. My dad tells me he had a tantrum and kicked in his wardrobe door. My dad had to fix it.

 If you're up for some Chiv or Natural Selection,add me on Steam: dimitricatnikov 




 I'd like to go but is it too late to get a pass? 




 Sweet. Starmade is Mac-compatible, I think. 
[Starmade.org](http://star-made.org) Should say whether it is or not. 




 My name's Raphael,too! I don't have Civ V or portal,but I do have Minecraft and Starmade if you want to play. Starmade's free and a shitload of fun if you don't have Minecraft. 




 Hey, guys. I've been suffering a fairly large bout of depression recently and was hoping I could kickstart my love of gaming again as I've lost enjoyment of it. If anyone is up for some Chivalry, Minecraft, Starmade or any other multiplayer game that we both own, I'd be more than happy to add them on Steam. My Steam id is dimitricatnikov. 




 It'd be good to meet other gamers with depression.If anyone's up for some Chivalry,Minecraft or Starmade my steam id is dimitricatnikov. 




 Fucking awesome,man! Thanks heaps,you actually got really  close to how I imagine her. :) 




 That's fine,whatever is easiest. 




 How's it going? I'm not very good at introductory messages,but thanks for replying. 




 Clothing should be a simple white blouse,buttoned to the neck and a long red skirt. She also wears boots made of insect chitin and a pendant in the form of a leafless tree  




 Sweet,cheers. :) 




 I don't have a picture but I can try to describe as best I can. Could you draw me a woman of about 35 years who has dark brown skin and her long,brown skin hair braided in an intricate pattern,almost like a the pattern of a doiley if you've ever seen one. She should have bright green eyes and a stern,angry look. Starting from her forehead,there should be a tattoo of a bird who's wings stretch down each cheek and its beak should stop just above her nose. The bird should be coloured blue and green . I hope that description is adequate,I can give more details if you want. Thanks,heaps . :) 




 Alesund-Sun Kil Moon.
Actually ,anything from Sun Kil Moon is good to listen to. 




 When I first bought vanilla WoW 5 years ago I read and re-read the manual for a month because my computer shat itself. 




 Hey, it's all practice, right? I like the way you did the gasmask, might keep it in mind next time I visualise this type of character. The context behind it is that he's deserted the army and find's a picture of a happy family on his way back, which he doesn't have, and it breaks him. 




 I acknowledge that animals have feelings and thank them for their sacrifice to bring me sweet,tasty meat products. You're doing God's work,countless millions of domesticated animals! 




 A man in a gas-mask and full scaled body armour kneeling while holding a photo of a happy family. Gas-mask should be integrated into his helmet and scaled armour should look reminiscent of a samurai's or a cop in riot gear. If this could be done in a realistic style I'd be very grateful. 




 No, not at the moment. I just recently went to my gp to get referred to a psychologist, though. I guess that's a start. I hope we do, too; it sucks having no real identity. 




 It is incredibly difficult to not be labeled as such. I make a point of never letting my friends know whether I'm feeling depressed or not because of the same fear that you have: that they will dismiss it as 'not their problem'. Unfortunately, when I drink I let my depression come to the surface and begin ranting about the meaninglessness of existence, which I feel alienates me slightly every time. I put it down to my belief that 'normal' people are afraid of depressed individuals; we are foreign to them in our behaviour and it unsettles them, even if they try to empathise they are still unnerved a little by us. They see in us an existence that they can't fully comprehend without having been there, and attempt to visualise what it would be like for them,which scares them, and so some try to distance themselves. Just as we (speaking from my perspective) can't understand what makes them happy, they can't understand what makes us depressed all the time, and so they label us as 'The Depressed Person'.By doing this it essentially isolates what we do and how we think and classifies it as the behaviour of the depressed, something they should try not to get involved in in case our negativity 'rubs off' onto them. This is just my observation ,however, I don't even know if all this made sense. 




 Don't have much of a story,I'm afraid. There aren't many interesting parts, it just kind of ponders along skipping all the usual milestones of life;there is no real good to it and there is no real bad. Frankly, I can't really see it achieving much. 




 This is incredibly close to how I feel. Even now,sitting in a lecture by myself, I can see a glimpse of.everyone else's potential personalities,but when I think of myself I can't remember what I used to be like. It's like I'm almost apart from everyone's reality,stuck in my own lonely existence. I wish I could escape and enter the 'living' world. Do you feel this way,too? 




 Awww yiss. Finally my highly visible 'wog' forearm veins will get me some. 




 So my pc has started restarting randomly while I'm using it. Sometimes it will restart as I'm starting it up, other times it will restart while I'm in the middle of a game. The weird thing is, though, it doesn't happen every time I start up a game. Sometimes I can play uninterrupted for hours, have a break, and then it will do it. It also does this thing where it will boot up, but the screen will go black even though I can hear the welcome noises on my headphones.

 Beautiful,thanks heaps! 




 A man in a gas-mask/respirator helmet and a full set of segmented armour kneeling while holding a picture of a happy family. Is that too complex? 




 Sweet, looking forward to it. 




 D: He's not a monstrosity;his name is Jooki and he's probably the friendliest river-burrower you could ever meet. Thank you so much for this, you have no idea how much this cheered me up.  




 If someone could draw me a picture of a small, coffee-skinned girl of about 15 or so with long, light brown hair holding an insect that is half the length of her. The insect would basically look like a massive centipede without the bottom antennae;it has no eyes, only four long,thin antennae on it head and a set of large serrated mandibles. It is also almost see-through. This would make my month if it could be drawn. Thanks,guys. 




 Do you know what they call lettuce in France? 




 I do this often,too. I also constantly think of theoretical situations regarding people I've never met potentially hurting me. 




 No problem,mate. Pm me whenever you need to vent. 




 I'm 19. I saw my first and only psychologist two years ago. Then I moved and have never really taken the steps again to see another one 




 I don't have a psychologist anymore. The one I did have did very little to change my perspective;probably because I didn't fully open up. I feel if  were to keep a journal I wouldn't show it to anyone anyway for fear of being misunderstood, or categorized as one personality type or another. 




 Emptiness is a fucked thing, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. The feeling that a sooner death could outweigh the endless possibilities that life presents is hard to shake sometimes. I've tried, but that notion stills persists. I can't give you any way of successfully filling that void,but I can empathize with you. I don't know much about life but if you just need someone to vent your troubles on,I'd like to help in whatever way I can. I hate seeing people share this shitty emptiness. 
























 It's all in the diaphragm,man. Gotta work that airway. 




 All good. I'm from Australia.

 I'm guessing that's...Wisconsin? Sorry, I'm not from the US. Sounds pretty cool,though. 




 Haha,wow. That is pretty cool. Where are they from? I'm not the kind of person who looks into an artist's history. 




 Hey! This is an awesome idea. I don't have Spotify but I should be able to manage a bunch of YouTube links. Could you make me a playlist centred around a sombre mood? Like the kind of music you'd hear if you were exploring a ruined city ,or were about to kill someone you love. I'm not a serial killer,btw. I'm a writer and this kind of music helps me visualise scenes. If it's any help,I usually listen to artists like The Fleet Foxes,Bon Iver and Massive Attack.

*Edit:Thanks heaps. 




 Cephaloporoid? 




 Gaming and working on my conlang. I only really rekindled my interest in the latter a couple of days ago, hopefully it'll lead to me wanting to write again.

 Please stop trolling.

The guy asked a serious question. 




 Don't worry,OP. I'm 5'7 and I'm still rowing. In fact, I think I'll always keep rowing as they'll beat me otherwise.^help 




 Welp,looks like I've found my problem. 

Thanks,mum 




 Holy Shit. You just slipped that right in there,didn't you ? 




 I want to be included,too! Does dressing as the Black Death for Year 8 Medieval Day count? 




 No amount of flying lawnmowers are going to settle these jimmies. Critical overrustle achieved. 




 Can I get a bravery check? 




 Language. 

I can barely sum up any interest or energy in most of the things I do, but learning about language and how it's formed by, and helps shape, sound patterns/morphological processes/syntax etc. is the only thing that really reminds me of the fact that I can still feel excited about something, even though my attention is sporadic at best. 




 Language! 




 Hey, guys.

I have almost non-existent social skills when it comes to meeting new people and one of the largest barriers I frequently come across is that I can never initiate conversation with anyone. I've been at uni for almost two semesters now and I have still yet to develop a proper social life;I have only really been able to talk to one other person out of all my classes at uni.

I barely see the friends I do have, and I can almost go whole weeks without speaking to anyone but my aunty. So I was wondering if any of you guys know how I can overcome my fear of talking to strangers?

Thanks heaps. 




 I found out that there is a group of non-pulmonic sounds in human language called ejectives which are pretty much sounds formed with little explosions of air afterwards; try saying 'p' but really forcing it out. I reckon that the fact that some language somewhere uses these as a  part of their everyday communication really awesome.^^^^ihavenolife 




 I dip my dick into a vat of soup to check if it's warm and 94 cats claw it off. 




 What was this man's name? Christ, everyone has a name.

Where had he lived? On a farm as I had? Did he too cherish memories of wide,clear sky reflected in small diaphanous ponds and welcome the calm blanketing of darkness on his fields after sunset had burnt itself into his retinas at the end of each day?

Had he also shared a million small moments with his lover, knowing things that only they had experienced? Had he held his lover's hand as she died of sickness as I had? Had he too broken the hope of his children when he'd explained where she'd gone? 

Is this why he was here?

Is this why he fought? For the same reasons as I do? Was he a broken man seeking solace in the face of this indifferent beast of war?

Did he dream of the feint chatter of wind-chimes before an angry,unforgiving horizon? Is that what kept him restful during the cold nights and their symphony of artillery barrages, when the only light to be found was in hellish flashes against a choked,pitiful landscape?

Had he also seen men wail before the arms of death as they clutched their organs as offerings? Did he fear silence as I do? Had he heard the breathless rattles of men seeking comfort from the impatient embrace of non-existence as they bled their life and memories onto the mud?

My chest tightened as I watched him splutter.

 If I was still the same man as I had been I would have left him to be found by his comrades. He would have lived.

But his eyes were too familiar, they begged with a pathetic fear akin to my own. What right  do I have to decide the fate of another wretched creature such as myself? What grand scheme directed these dire circumstances between us?

I felt my empathy curdle and lose its hold on my thoughts. 

Because he was not like me.

And so I shot him.  




 My book. 

I have a fucking language to invent, multiple cultures to write about and an entire bloody world history to create not to mention actually writing the novel, and here I am on Reddit writing about these things and not doing them. 




 Yeah,that's probably it. 

As I was getting towards the end of school I was getting more and more worried about missing out on the 'normal teenage-life milestones' that and so I probably figured "Hey, that girl was friendly to me earlier, I should have a crush on her. Maybe then I'll achieve what's expected to have been done by my age and become normal."

Pined over her for sometime but never really talked to her or did anything, and now I'm still holding myself to the fact that I missed my only chance to actually overcome my fear of women and be accepted into the wider 'class' of those who can establish intimate relationships with the opposite sex which in turn exacerbates my awkwardness and fear which in keeps me from allowing myself to even consider dating properly. 

I'm now pretty much proper fucked when it comes to women and socialising in general. It's funny how one simple decision can fuck you over in the longer run,eh? 




 To be honest, I don't really know. Kind of a fear of being put on the spot mixed with general beta faggotry. 




 Refusing an offer to be kissed by a girl in high school whom I later developed a crush for but didn't have the balls to ask out. 

Two years later and I still haven't kissed anyone. Fuck. 




 Just let the poor cunt know that he's not getting anywhere  and to stop messaging. It's clear that he's oblivious, so just do him a kindness and tell him to go elsewhere. Many guys that are perceived as creepy are that way because they haven't properly learnt how to identify when they're over-stepping these kinds of social barriers,and so continue to press. 




 Your grandfather seemed like a profound kinda guy. Thanks, I'll definitely be considering this metaphor the next time I feel shitty. 




 I also feel the same. The only time I'm ever talked to my friends about how I feel is when I've been very drunk, and I felt I alienated myself from them even more so by doing that.

I also have made a plan to kill myself, but I keep putting it off for arbitrary reasons. For instance, I was planning on doing it next week sometime a couple of days ago, but now I've ordered Rome 2 so I've decided I'll wait for that to come and the off myself.

I really do hope you find someone who's willing to talk to you. 




 I'm glad it made sense to someone. I agree with you on the stigma towards depressed people in our society, especially towards men. It's almost as if we're told as men that emotion is something you hold within yourself or express to, in limited circumstances, only your loved ones, and if you hold too much emotion, you're overreacting and being a woman. 

Combining this perspective with my sleight build and short height makes me feel almost feminine in the eyes of other men, and this weighs down heavily on me.

Thanks for your words and welcome to the sub!  




 Yeah, it's fucking shit. And you're making perfect sense, this is exactly what I think. I have no idea whether it is actual depression being tricky with me, or whether I'm 'forcing' my self to feel what I assume would be how a depressed person feels. 




 I think seeing a therapist will, in the long run, help both of us realise where to attribute these emotions to, whether it be legitimate depression or otherwise. I'm going to recommend you see a therapist, not because I think that that mine will necessarily help me, but because I believe everyone should be entitled to a chance to change their lives. Whilst my chance may have well abandoned me, I'd like to think that yours hasn't.

Keep on keeping on. 




 Thanks for the reply; the community here is awesome. 

I have a hard time conveying emotion to people, even my family. I always feel that it isn't my place to burden them with my emotional problems as they've already got their own. 

I find myself thinking like this with my counselor,too. I think about how many people's sob stories he has to sit through and how that must weigh down on his patience. 

For some reason I have this notion that men are not supposed to give into their emotions and seek help, and therefore I mustn't be a man and mustn't have a valid reason for this pain. Your response has offered me a different perspective to what I'm used to, thanks. I don't often open up to people (only when I'm considerably drunk) so the outpouring of good advice and care in this thread has confounded me. 




 Holy shit. This is almost akin to how my emotions are at the moment. I can go from feeling incredibly bitter one day to mildly depressed another to pretty much empty some other days. I am never fully incapacitated, but I'm always slightly off-centre enough that it impairs me socially. I also feel the same overarching desolation, it really sucks.

I really hope you beat it,man. At least one of us has to. 




 When I was younger my mum was really sick. In an effort to cheer her up,my little brother consolled her with these wise word as he was sitting by her bed:

"An old frog jumps into a pond. Splash."

To this day she still thinks that it was incredibly profound. 




 Don't really know where all the paperwork is due to the fact that I've moved house twice since then, so I have no idea whether it'd still be under warranty. I also don't know what the real problem behind the card is, all I know is that my PC highlighted that there was a problem with the graphics driver in the event centre, and also my event log shows multiple Kernel Power event-41 issues. 




 Sweet, thanks. Another question (sorry), should I upgrade my CPU as well? It's an i5-5700k, I think.
Edit:2500K, not 5700K 




 Cool,760's seem to be pretty cheap atm. Also, does a GPU having more memory necessarily make it better than one with less? Is that a stupid question to ask? 




 Hey, guys. So I've had my GTX 560Ti for about a year now, and I've been noticing some problems. 
My computer will crash randomly whilst playing some games, and when I check my event log, it tells me that these crashes are due to a Kernel-Power Event. 
On further investigation it appeared that my GPU was the cause behind these crashes,so I've decided that if they continue, I'll probably have to replace my GPU. Question is, which GPU should I buy if I choose to do so? (keeping in mind I'd prefer to upgrade in performance as well). Or should I spend money on getting my GPU fixed instead? 




 Indifference.

I believe that one of the greatest achievements in human evolution is our development of empathy. To know that so many people in the world do what they do without any consideration of the experiences of others and how their decisions may affect others, without even the tiniest shred of empathy, really unnerves me.

And to think that (at least Western) societies could become even more apathetic to the lives of even those who are closest to them, is especially worrying. I mean indifference isn't some modern construct endemic to modern society, but I believe it could become almost a virtue of our age. It's the universe's position to be indifferent to our plight, not humanity's. 




 What is the deepweb? I've heard some talk about it, but I don't know whether it's a joke or not. 




 Because it would imply that they were some sort of whiny bitch, and in the eyes of most men discussing personal strife is seen as weakness. I mean,shit, look at the some shitstorm female cutters get, could you imagine if a male revealed that he was slashing up? It's fucked, and part of the reason why I don't cut despite the fact I am in a fair amount of emotional strain.
*edit: I spek gud england 




 The world of my novel. I could go on for ages talking about the various nuances of Othenai culture, and the formation of various political organisations. No one ever really listens,though. ;-; 




 Yeah, I have skype. Pretty sure the name's the same as my Steam:Chezzprinn 




 I will, as long as I am comforted by the knowledge that you, the finest specimen come to be produced by humanity's long and arduous evolutionary journey, will carry forward our race into neo-liberal paradise! 




 2edgy4me. Please take your edginess elsewhere, you're too hardcore for this thread. 




 Ain't no stopping it now,mate. 




 I have a feeling the Chinese are the villains in Battlefield 4. Correct me if I'm wrong. 




 I have to say I still haven't gotten over it. Hell, I wasn't even bullied that much but it has had an enormous effect on my life. 

I can't do anything without hearing the voices of people who had mocked me. I alter my own actions and social responses by what I assume they would think appropriate for me to do. I think of myself as lesser, as a creep, as something that doesn't fit in. It has driven me to contemplating suicide almost daily and has drained meaning from my life. I've become a needy,nervous bitch of a man; exactly how they had presumed I'd turn out. 

I haven't talked about this before, sorry if it comes across a little dramatic. 




 For Emma,Forever Ago-Bon Iver. Especially the song "The Wolves", gets me every time. 
























 Wasn't particularly intending for it to be taken as woman-blaming, probably just worded it wrongly. Rejection from women was most likely not the cause, but I bet you it exacerbated the problem. 




 Probably should have put 'people' instead of 'women',sorry. Although, I would  make the assumption that the people most creeped out by these guys would generally be women.

But you're right, it isn't the women's fault for rejecting them. The sad thing is, it's most likely no one's fault. These guys are just unlucky products of something that must've happened in their past that royally fucked up their ability to form relationships with the opposite sex. The problem probably compounded overtime as they faced rejection because of it, which in turn made them more desperate for some connection, which in turn made them more creepy, which in turn made them become more and more alienated to the point where they rely on dolls to obtain any form of intimacy.

Now they're at the point were rejection is an expected outcome for probably any desire for a relationship because of this world they've created to hide from society's branding of them as a creep, a world ,which in turn, makes them even more unnerving to people.

It's pretty sad.

 









 Can confirm that I use this site as a crutch. Not so much on the 'making friends' part,though. I'm as poor at making friends in the virtual world as I am at making them in the physical world. 




 Not always as easy as it sounds. Would you want to talk to these kinds of guys? They've likely been abused/rejected by women for most of their life,so I can easily see how spending all this money on something that won't reject them could be feasible,rather than possible constant rejection by real people. There's only so many times you can be alienated before you go a little crazy. 




 Giving her the old Kalishinyourkova. 




 Looks awesome, bugs and all. Have they hinted at a release date yet? 




 It's all a ruse,I'll tell ya! OP has us duped! 




 That I can dislocate and relocate my hip.

When I was little, I used to continuously dislocate and relocate my hip when I was frustrated. Like *pop* in *pop* out *pop* in. Thought everyone could do it.

 Apparently not. 




 Is it already in the files? How'd you get it to appear in-game? 




 Good point. Common sense doesn't come naturally to me for some reason. Editing post. 




  If you don't want to read the whole thing, an analysis of a couple of chapters or so is fine.

Edit:[link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9NEUm1X4z32cW0wVkRuVVlHQk0/edit?usp=sharing)

Thanks guys. :) 




 I've got a PhD in Cunt. 




 I'll designate myself for that matter. I studied Cunt Identification Studies for four years. 




 I'm 5'7", therefore I shall be King of the Shortmen. 




 This kind of makes me sad.  




 Do you think a 280x, i5 2500k and 8GB RAM would be enough to play this at at least medium? 









 Looks fucking fantastic. 









 Fuck.

Every time I start to feel just a little better about myself, I see shit like this. Christ, what's the fucking point in attempting anything if you're unattractive? Even if you 'improved your life', gained hobbies, yadda yadda, people will still treat you as some kind of subhuman. 

I mean, fuck. Fucking insulted by compliments from ugly men? I hate existence. 




 Cool, thanks! It's around 16000 words,though. Do you want me to just send over a sample chapter, or the whole thing? 




 May as well jump on board as well. Do you read sci-fi fantasy? I could really do with some proper crit. My mum is not a very  unbiased reader. 









 Mate, this is how we all dance. Even the sheilas. Even the koalas. Everyone. 

Got me VB, got me stubbies. Time for a gabba. 




 Is this for real? Or is it a scam? Sorry, I'm a little too careful sometimes. 




 My friends and family all think I have something planned for the future, and that I care about my uni degree. Truth is, I can't even imagine living out more than a few more years without eventually committing suicide. 




 I doubt this.

I have overheard random strangers discussing my face with the exact same opinion as myself.  




 This is what I'm worried about. I keep thinking that I'm going to waste the minimal almost non-existent chance I have of finding someone and being happy because I'm so fucked up socially/emotionally, and that the rest of my life is going to be empty and much worse off. I'm pretty much awaiting the day when I finally become certain of killing myself as opposed to being undecided as I am now.  




 Depression.

It slowly but surely leached all meaning from them. I keep thinking 'Why bother doing anything when my life's shit anyway.I don't really want to keep living,so why then should I pretend to care about anything in my life?' 




 I don't really have passions anymore.

First my passion for writing died,then reading and now even gaming does nothing for me.

I'm like an empty shell.
 




 I would want to date her but I'm pretty sure I'd have like a 0.001% chance as I'm not the best looking dude and I weigh the same as most women my age.

I don't usually do anything social, so I probably wouldn't have anything better to do but I'd probably be miserable anyway. 




 I used to get stuck on the Zeppelin between Kalimdor and Lordaeron for hours at a time. 




 Hey,guys

So I just received an invitation from a girl in one of my uni classes to go to her birthday party. A bunch of people from this particular class have been invited, so I'm not under any special consideration or anything. However I don't really talk to anyone much in the class, so I was a bit surprised when I got the invite. There will also be a whole bunch of people there that I haven't met before so I'm worried that if I go, I will pretty much isolate myself as I don't really 'know' anyone.

What should I do? 




 I am the first person in existence to speak Othenai. 




 Eh, haircut or no haircut, I still look like a spaz. 




 Bugger.

I'm actually an ugly cunt, so seeing all of the people on here who aren't actually that ugly and still FA makes me feel kind of shitty. 
Hopefully you fools will use my pictures to motivate yourselves as it's definitely not your looks holding you back. Get out there!

Edit: Picture time is over.
 




 Did I tell you how much I smoke w33d? im liek a [-3] now 




 I'm a guy, I think it could be a little weird if I rubbed vaginal scent behind my ears. 




 My gooch is sparkly fresh every day and I've never been laid.

Edit: I think I may have been misunderstood. A gooch is slang for your perineum ( the skin between your arse and your knob) not for vagina. I'm a dude, I wash my gooch, not my vagina.  




 Depends how much effort you want to put into world building. 

If I were to name a new world, I would probably base its name off of the language of the main character/dominant culture/who is telling the story in the world. You don't necessarily have to create the entire language of the most dominant culture but if you align the world's name with the same distinct style as, say, the cities of this culture, it would give it a unique flavour.  




 My dad went through this exact same procedure! They also took bone from his wrist to use as cartilage for the new nose. His doesn't look so fancy,though. 




 Very little nowadays. Even when I laugh I feel pretty empty.  




 It makes you feel that  the only solace and acknowledgment you will ever receive is from the wheels of an oncoming train. 




 Ah,ok.

Haven't really heard much about neuroplasticity  outside of the small amount of time I spent reading about it for my linguistics classes, so I'm definitely uninformed on the matter. 




 humans aren't locked in like you seem to think.

Maybe not so much for Alphas and Betas, but most of the stuff I've read pretty much condemns Omegas to a lifetime of mediocrity and inadequacy.  




 I have no idea what you are talking about as far as Omega's and your pyramid but I will say a few things

Pyramid structure probably wasn't the right term to use, I'll change that. Cheers.

As for the 'fake it till you make it', I have trouble wondering how someone would go about doing that, basing their entire life off a false persona. It is really that easy? 




 Right here with you,mate. I'll sit in the same spot for the majority of the weekend imagining the happy, eventful lives of others. 




 All the time,man.

I know that to get better and actually live a good life', I am going to have to drastically change the way I look/behave/think. Knowing this makes me bitter, and so I tell myself that even after all my struggles to get better, if I choose to get better, I'll be a totally different person and I'll hate myself for it. I'll hate myself and, more so,I'll direct that hatred onto others. 

I still believe that happiness isn't something that I'm allowed to achieve in the end; I'm just not meant to ever get it, and that if I do,it will be unnatural.  




 Great, now I have to cancel my tickets.

Fuck.

 Damn.

Well, I guess we just got coaxed into a snafu.

 Hey,guys. I don't think a post like this goes against the rules. If so, I'll delete it.

I heard somewhere on Reddit/Facebook that smoking cannabis can aid in alleviating some symptoms of depression and so was wondering, as I'm fairly depressed,whether I should consider it as an option to help me gain back some semblance of normality.

 My mum is a daily user and has often noted that smoking gives her heightened creative motivation which resounds quite a lot with me as one of the biggest things I've come to miss is my want to write, which has pretty much been killed off due to my general apathy towards everything.

However I've also heard that marijuana can exacerbate depressive symptoms, so I'm a bit conflicted as to whether I should take up smoking or not.

What's your opinion on cannabis' effectiveness in dealing with depression? 




 Nah,man. My life's already exhausted the limited amount it had to offer me. After I experience those last few games,I'll have no reason to stay. 




 Nineteen* I'm just pretty much waiting for a few games to be released/developed further before I go through with it.

Edit: Number 19 wasn't working. 




 I'm with you,man. I've even given myself a time limit. 




 That was quite beautifully put, I feel as though I'm responding to Shelley's Monster, it reminds me of her style of writing and makes me realise how inadequate and ineloquent I actually am as a writer.

I am actually afraid to respond because I don't think I'd be able to do so with such sophistication, but you're right--I probably should have more empathy towards other people's loneliness, I do tend to forget that I'm not the only one who's hurting.

Thanks for that response,by the way. I always love seeing excellent word-smithing in action!

 




 It's like people don't want to change to NOT be forever alone.

Some of us don't have a choice. 

When people condescend me with posts about how they too are FA because they wear silly shirts and "Oh, guys, look how FA I am, I only received two text messages today!", I respond with bitterness. 




 Maybe not in all cases but in some. I'm gonna post a personal anecdote in response to this.

To preface, I'm a pretty fucking ugly guy. I was going up to attend a friend's party on the train, and because I'm relatively small and nervous around other people, I chose a seat away from most people. A group of girls and one other guy hopped on and sat maybe four or five seats ahead of me. 

I didn't look at these people, I minded my own business. It was about half-way through the trip when I heard them discussing me, about how I was 'creepy' ( mind you, I hadn't looked at them at all)and about how they'd probably kill themselves if they woke up to a face like mine. They later stuck a note on the back of my bag as I left saying 'Fuck me, I'm desperate.'

I guess the point of this post is, some women (and men) do label unattractive guys 'creepy', even if they have had not prior social contact with them. I should also note that I was dressed appropriately (no scorpion jacket or fedora, *lol people who wear fedoras are so retarded, amirite?*), and had just had a haircut that most would deem 'socially acceptable'. There was no reason beyond my face that these people would find me creepy. 

Edit: Shit at grammar. I'll never make it as a writer. 




 Look around here, do you see many photos of people? Who do you think frequents this sub usually? 

Of course a photo of a somewhat attractive woman is going to be treated differently than any other post; this entire sub is pretty much centred around the rejection and isolation of young, socially awkward men by women or other men. 

A woman posting something here is a rarity, and a picture even more so. Hell, do you see men posting pictures of themselves often here? A picture of an attractive woman here is going to blow up ten-fold, even if it is about the most asinine subject, which, at least speaking for myself, makes me feel as if it is disingenuous in nature and plays to the fact that this sub comprises mainly of lonely men. (whether I'm right or wrong). 

Whether OP knew of this or not, the negative response was not to the fact that she had no right to be FA because she was female, but to this feeling of her being a female exploiting the generally male user base to garner attention.

This is a sub, much like your own (SRS), that is a melting pot of negative emotions, and sometimes those emotions lash out against seemingly innocent people. 

OP,you probably weren't using your sex to gain attention, however the responses you received weren't because you 'aren't allowed' to be FA, as some of the SRS posters are implying, but because you posted a seemingly normal photo of yourself attached to an arbitrary subject  to a sub that rarely has anything like that occur and consists mainly of lonely males.

And to the SRS poster above me, I see no need for abuse. We get it, you hate men, but this sub already pretty much hates itself, so applying the same blanket hate on the men here as you do the rest of Reddit is a pretty lowly move. 

The last thing most of these guys need (myself included) is to be reminded of how much women hate us.  




 Not as bad as the Central Coast,cunt. 

come 2 umina bra ill beet tha shit outta u 




 I'm sorry that happened to you.

I agree looks don't hold anything towards someone's experiences/story/whatever, but they do build assumptions. You can't deny that being a female on this sub is a rarity and so any posts by one will invariably be treated either hostilely or in a desperately friendly sort of way based on the assumption (whether wrong or not) that women are the centre of our woes. Thus, even though you may not have been looking for attention, it will automatically be assumed that you are based on your gender by at least someone.

It's shitty but, again, lots of negativity around here. 




 I wouldn't say we're stuck up, we're just bitter. 

This is the only place (at least, the only I know of) that people like us can come and whinge about our sad existences, so when someone comes around that seems like they have a normal life or should have a normal life, most of the time they're met with hostility, more so if they're female. 




 I second that.

I get that it's nice to have others layer you with compliments, but coming into a sub that consists mainly of young, lonely, possibly unattractive males as a moderately attractive female, in an effort to reap the attention it will undoubtedly bring, is a bit much. 




 *heh* 




 Dude,can't you see they're 'le tr0llin' us? They're so witty,haha. 




 Cheers. 




 Ok,sweet. Thanks. 




 Shit,I'm way out of my knowledge here. You find that by using ipconfig in CMD,right? And what's an octet? 




 Repent, ye sinners, and look upon the name of thy Lord! REPENT! IS NOT HIS NAME PLASTERED UPON YOUR VERY SOUL? ARE THEE NOT TRUE GABESMEN? 




 That's the Ipv4 address,right? ( Sorry,never had to look for my I.P before) 




 Hey,man. I entered a key last night and was successful but I wasn't quick enough typing in my details, so I lost it. When I tried another key later on, I got a 404 on the page and was forbidden. Was my I.P blocked because I was too fast entering the code or something? I'm not a bot. (At least, I don't think I am.) 




 I'm beginning to think I may have spent a little too much on my build unnecessarily. I wish I had seen this post before I made a purchase.
 




 God bloody dammit. I got the code in, but it was redeemed by the time I entered my details. Now I'm blocked form the server. :/ I hate this game. 




 How?! How are they so fucking fast? Do they have robot fingers? 




 I'm not quick enough for this shit. I hate my slow-typing fingers. ;-; 




 These albatross necklaces are pretty fashionable,though. 




 I thought it was full of angry liberal SJW neckbeards? I guess what the 'majority' of Reddit consists of changes according to which sub decides to get angry. The sub deciding this time around is SRS. I wish we could just all decide on one kind of majority (which we obviously would never belong to) to hate. How about just people who have actual neckbeards?  




 He is the Master of Ruse. 




 Exactomundo.

People always waffle on about that whole 'be confident,have hobbies, go to the gym, then you too can be like us normal looking people',but that's just not the case. It sounds shitty, but physically unattractive people are pretty much fucked when it comes to achieving the same sort of satisfaction in relationships as normal/attractive people. No amount of confidence is going to make someone who dates you feel proud of who they are dating if you're ugly. You'll always be seen as inferior, and besides, even if you do end up finding someone, you're probably not going to be attracted to them, anyway. 

Everyone's shallow. 




 It's almost as if someone told Will.i.am one day that he was going to be famous overnight and then made him famous the next day. He acts like he's never really gotten used to the idea. 




 Maybe so. I would imagine there'd be a whole range of factors that contributed to how they are now, but I wouldn't rule out their interactions with women as one of them. 




 Sweet Jesus, I've never been to that subreddit before. It's like an enormous pit of confirmation bias and circlejerkery. The fact that that sub is still there, despite their apparent past doxxing, and that /r/pcmasterrace isn't confounds me. 




 What if we're the small ones? 




 What has it gotten me? absolutely nothing.

That there's the problem,mate. You're expecting something. Unfortunately,happiness isn't a guarantee and just because you 'do good things', doesn't mean you deserve women's affection. It sucks, I know. All of us wish we could receive an award for doing good shit, but it doesn't work that way. 
























 Botched Castration! 




 Happy Birthday,mate! Have a good one! 




 Pfffft. Get your crazy talk outta here. I'll have you know,I enjoy my boar-chicken. 




  British English is a non-rhotic dialect, it's difficult to pronounce r's in the way that Americans do (pronouncing them in every context). You guys kind of curl your tongues back when you pronounce an 'r', whereas there are few (probably none) actual r's at the end of words in British English.

 +1 for Siege weapons, that shit would be awesome. 




 Well, that hasn't happened in a long time.

 Hey,guys. I've recently been looking into WildStar and am getting pretty excited about the prospect of playing it, but I was wondering if there were any plans on adding a cash-shop into the game? I've heard that ESO is doing one and I'm beginning to get worried that this might be the trend of the other MMORPG's coming out.

So, is there a cash-shop planned? 




 Wait? They revealed more weapons? When? Do you have any pics?

Cool ideas,btw. 




 I kind of liked the Happening; 13 year-old me enjoyed that tiger scene with the amputated arm. I don't really remember the story,though. 




 Yeah, neither community is overly good or bad; there's just as much shit on Reddit as there is on 4Chan. 




 Damn, now I feel betrayed. 

Fuck you, OP. :( 




 *Brave* 




 Beautiful. Gotta love their overconfidence at the start. That dude speaking  was probably rocking a rager at the thought of raiding your base, he certainly sounded like it,hahaha/ 




 More what? What more do you need? I'm not being sarcastic, I literally have no clue. I'm not a 'nice guy' --I can't even talk to people my age, regardless of their sex-- so when someone says tells me that I have to be more than 'just nice' to gain friends/a girlfriend, I'm pretty confused. 

I mean, all someone would have to do to improve their relationship with me would be to be nice to me, but I'm supposed to have something extra to garner their attention?  




 The day I tested out my improvised electrical cord noose. Good thing I pussied out, now my parents will never know!

 I'd love to see more resources gained from hunting-- bone for bone armour/picks,intestines for bow strings, other offal for fertiliser if/when farming is implemented.  




 Sweet. Well, I've added you. You should get a request from Chezzprinn (dimitricatnikov). I won't be able to play just yet but I'll be on around Thursday.
 




 My group on Rust could use some more people, if you're interested. There's about three of us on a good day and we've got a ts server we frequent, so we're always looking for new people. Only thing is that I'm unable to play until this Thursday, so there's only really one of us playing atm but, if you like, I can add you on Steam anyway. 




 Good luck, big fella! Make us proud! 




 Fuck's sake,I was thinking of getting this game. Guess I'm not anymore at that price... 




 Great Googly Moogly. I almost piddled myself when I had to push hard to clip in my processor. 




 Rust is incredibly fun when things are going your way, yet can be pretty frustrating sometimes. I personally haven't had any interactions with hackers but apparently they've been fairly prevalent on larger servers.

All in all,though, it has a lot of potential and can lead to a great variety of interactions. 




 Why would they DDoS steam? It doesn't make sense. 




 Phew, knew it wasn't just me. Thanks,mate! 




 Hey,guys. 

Long-time lurker here who's recently begun to kick himself back into worldbuilding to supplement my desire to continue on with my novel.


I was wondering about the number of unique states I have in my world and whether there's too few of them for a world roughly the same size as the Earth;I have six autonomous states at the moment, with the world being respectively divided between them. Two are oligarchies run by pseudo-merchants/wealthy families, one is a transhumanist theocracy,one is an absolute monarchy,one is an autocracy determined by a cultural hegemony and one is a partial democracy.

At the moment, my worldmap looks pretty bland in terms of state diversity and amount. Each state holds enormous swathes of land and the more I look at it, the more I'm thinking that maybe I should invest in creating a few smaller states to bring about a more realistic geo-political environment.

What do you guys think?       




 I feel you,mate.

I spent my NYE and my NYD in bed. Hopefully the rest of 2014 doesn't follow through in the same way. :/ 




 What about a R9 280x and a i5 2500K? Will that be enough? 




 So DayZ is a FFA Arma deathmatch with the occasional zombie thrown in? 




 Me,too! We could form our very own wolfpack! 




 Got myself a nice,fancy weapon-flashlight mod if you guys are interested. I could do with some more 5.56mm rounds and/or an I.V transfusion. 




 You have the all clear. Hackers are cunts. 




 Anyone know how to use the Saline I.V bags? I've tried putting the bag in my hand and dragging the I.V starter kit onto it but nothing happens. Is it glitched or something? 




 As Penguin said, for planning my day. I've bought it now, and stuck it on the fridge. Hopefully it'll remind to do shit,haha. 




 I got one! I wrote out my thoughts and feelings on 2Chainz's description of a 'big booty ho' in the hit single  'Bubble Butt'. 




 Yesterday, I told myself that I probably don't want to die just yet and suspended any suicide plans for the time being.

Today, I made a list of shit I should do for the day and plan on expanding it gradually as each new day comes.

Wish me luck, /r/depression, and also luck to those who haven't made their lists yet and will hopefully someday find a reason for staying.

 I would've thought temperance would be a prerequisite for a police officer. I mean, you're going to cop shit like that all the time whilst on duty--there's no place for violent outbursts in a profession where the likelihood of receiving some kind of abuse is pretty much guaranteed and known beforehand.

If you're a cop and you respond violently to being spit on, you probably should've chosen a different job. 




 As a dairybased-kin, I take offence to your blatant disregard of the sexual agency of cream in that it should be allowed to choose whether it is licked or not. Check your lactose privilege. 




 Yeah, I'm not adverse to them putting in sound, just as long as that sound makes sense in the setting, ( like no StarWars-esque 'pew-pews'. It'd be awesome if they put in an atmosphere system, it's almost a must for the game. 




 I can dislocate and relocate my hip. 
That's about it,really. 




 Drilling is the only one sound in the game so far,everything else is silent because space. I don't know much about the bug,sorry,but I have heard that it's pretty common  throughout the community.

I can almost taste the congealed hypocrisy dripping off of her sweaty upper lip. 




 It is! 

Just gotta keep in mind that it is in pretty early Alpha (so no guns or multiplayer yet) but the devs have been releasing updates almost weekly, so I have full faith in their ability to continue developing it! 
























 Never done it, I'm not much of a beach person. 




 So, in an effort to improve my aesthetics, I've joined the gym. Only problem is that to push myself, I need to have someone to lift with. I'm a skinny bloke, and the chance of me coathangering myself is pretty high.
Anyone around the Manly/Northern beaches area that wants to join me in a quest for swoleness?

 Yeah, I'm pretty much like this as well. I know that the likelihood of me getting a girlfriend that I'd be attracted to is low, so I don't even bother trying, nor do I complain about how hot girls won't date me. I know why they won't date me and it's the same reason why I won't date unattractive women. 

Physical appearanceeverything else in a relationship. 




 They better get rid of this bullshit before launch. Fuck, I had high hopes for this game. 




 Brings a tear to me eye. 









 Cheers, mate. 

This question was mainly directed towards people like you who happen to stumble across our sub and/or make an effort to post advice and the like. I got the feeling that the other sub I posted to didn't really give a shit about answering my question because I was just another sad, lonely male, and so I thought this sub might be able to better help me as most understand my situation. 




 I'm pretty sure this is still considered under FA jurisdiction. Anyway, here it is: 

"Hey guys.
I'm a bit new to this whole relationship-with-another-sex biz, being as I've had quite a bit of trouble with girls/women in the past and that I've never had a girlfriend/kissed/had sex/all that good intimate relationship stuff, so bear with me if I sound a bit naive or dickheaded as I'm pretty much running on a teenager's understanding of relationships.
So, the story goes that I met this girl at a party where I was quite drunk. I found her quite attractive and so mustered all the liquored-up courage I could find to talk to her. We got on pretty well and I ended up getting her phone number. I asked her on a date ( I'm pretty sure it was one) a week or so later, and when the time came, I met her and I had a pretty good time. After that, I asked her out again to which she said yes. However this second time she didn't respond to the plans I made for whatever reason ( which I was cool with) and we didn't go out.
We still texted however, with her almost always being the one to initiate conversation, as I was too terrified of appearing annoying and/or needy. After some time, we agreed on seeing each other again and this time actually did. It went well again ( I think), except this time I didn't press for another meeting.
Again more sporadic texting continued( I'm not so good at maintaining constant contact) with her one day hinting at ( well, not really hinting, she pretty much said, " Let's meet up again.") meeting again. I agreed, we made plans, but we both forgot to follow through.
Fast-forward to this week where I asked her out to dinner and she agreed ( as usual). After this she asked me whether or not we were going on a 'date' to which I replied that I don't mind whether it is or not. She decided that we should probably keep it casual, I agreed.
I should probably mention that during this whole time communicating with her her I've been trying hard to balance the teenage urges of wanting to finally get my first-kiss/lose my virginity/have a girlfriend and my more realistic attitudes on the fact that she might not want to date me and that her friendship holds just as much value as a possible intimate relationship.
So, I'm left wondering whether I should deal with these urges to get a girlfriend by pushing for a more intimate relationship but risk ruining a perfectly good chance at a friendship, or whether I should play it safe but retain a possible deep-seated pining for her to view me as more than a friend that may lead me to becoming resentful and bitter.
What do?
TL;DR: I've been communicating with a girl and have developed a fondness for her but don't know whether I should harness this fondness and channel it into making a lasting friendship with her, or whether I should push for intimacy ( which I am severely lacking in my life). What should I do?
Cheers!"

Thanks, guys.

 Hey guys.

Was thinking of getting into a new MMO and saw this on Steam a while ago, but I'm worried that it might be dead.

Are there still large PVP battles as advertised and is the community large enough to not have me wandering around in a virtual ghost town?

Thanks. 




 Same :/ 




 We do the same thing here in Australia,too. Using 'us' as a first-person personal pronoun is only ever used in the imperative mood,though! Like, you can say, "Chuck us a beer,Shazza," but not, "Shazza chucked us (me) a beer." 




 Watch out, Tone's talking tough! 




 I find it admirable that you changed yourself, but what I'm trying to get across is the fact that your genetics, your 'decent looking' appearance, allowed such a change to begin.

I have lost count of the times I have read about people doing very similar 'life changes', but due to their physical appearance, there effort was fruitless.

Let me guess, judging on the fact that you could play basketball, you're at least average-tall height? Do you think you'd be in the same situation now if you'd been 5 foot 4? Or only 5 foot? Were you consistently mocked solely on your appearance in high school? How would you have joined the military and gained all that self-confidence if you'd had colour-blindness, short/long sightedness, any other form of minor or major disability that disallows many people from joining the military.

What I'm trying to say, mate, is that you, myself and most other people attempt to force how they overcame their past troubles onto another's present troubles without giving any thought as to the context of the other person and why they may feel/act the way they do.

It's good that you were able to change yourself, but realise that there are many factors at play that affect whether other people, especially FA people, could possibly change their life's circumstances. For some, there is no light, no green grass, no saviour in the clouds, only a life of agonizing monotony and crippling social rejection, despite any effort to change such a fate. 




 And where are these guys, most of which can barely speak to a stranger at a bus stop (myself included), supposed to gain this learning from if they can't even enter into ONE intimate relationship, no matter how unhealthy/healthy?

Count yourself lucky, mate, that your genetics gave you the right to proper social conditioning and previous social experience-- a right that  enables you to make these nice, egocentric platitudes in response to the suffering of those who were didn't receive such a bounty.  




 Let's be honest with ourselves, mate. 

You 'dated down' in looks to an acceptable level in your opinion; appearance still dictated who you went for as you specifically aimed to 'lower your standards', thus taking into account the fact that the girl you were looking for didn't quite meet your preference of appearance, and that you were conceding your 'decent looking' self to date someone lower or equal to how you viewed yourself physically.

Physical appearance most likely still presided over your 'revelation', only now you convinced yourself that it was the *personality*  of your chosen girlfriend, not solely her physicality, that you desired.

I have no doubt whatsoever if that 10/10 personality woman you were searching for looked like a foot, your 'decent looking' self would continue his search elsewhere for a mate. 




 **[Passive Aggression intesifies]** 




 It has everything to with your looks. What kind of fantasy world do you live in? 




 Happy Birthday, big fella! 




 Sorry,mate. First time on this sub;didn't read the sidebar. 




 Exactly. I think large ships should take a massive amount of time+multiple people to build. Building should be a team effort. 




 Yeah, keep telling yourself that. 









 I find that hard to believe. You look like the exact kind of girl that I would desperately try not to look at in an attempt not to be creepy if I saw you at a bar. 




 Of course it's not your fault, you don't choose what to eat, or how much you exercise. .. Grow the fuck up kid.

Don't listen to this bullshit. 

People couldn't give two fucks about whether you workout or eat right if you're objectively unattractive, especially if you have feminine facial features;you'll still only be "that ugly guy/girl with the good body." 




 Men who don't look like like 'proper' men have very little chance of being respected or desired, and if anything this tendency is growing stronger with standards of male physical beauty becoming increasingly stringent and commodified.

 This is exactly why I can never accept ' just be confident' stance from my friends when I tell them I'll likely never get a girlfriend. 

My genes failed me; it's unfortunate, but that's just how it is sometimes. My body/face would need to be aligned to what women naturally gravitate towards and that's something I physically can't do. 




 I'm a fifth! Also not in Melbourne,though. 




 Mate, that comment history is...shady at best. Redditor for one month but nearly every single one of your comments has to do with Russia/US, with your views holding a fairly obvious Western bias. And you've been commenting a lot in that one month.

I'm no supporter of Russia, but your account is kind of suspicious. 




 C'mon,mang. 

Don't you think this is a...little overboard? I only know a little about women, but I'm pretty sure most of them would agree that this sort of behaviour is what constitutes as creepy. 




 *sniffle* Brings a tear to me eye. 




 Mount and Blade. 

Slaughtering peasants always cheers me up. 




 The story of the scar isn't all that interesting,really. 

Basically, I went to put the bunny back in his cage and he used my arm as a springboard, ripping a sizeable chunk out of my arm with his bunny talons.

That wasn't what earned him his vicious reputation,though. He attained that through what he did to Hoolio, my mum's prized guinea pig. R.I.P Hoolio. :( 




 A surprisingly vicious rabbit.

 [Lip smacking intensifies] 




 "Potato mash,sweetie?"

And here it was. 

That small white,lumpy hill of churned starch,butter and milk, served up on his favourite plate--the one with the colourful stegosauruses parading along its rim--sat testament to his corruption, his betrayal...*his murder.*

Heinrich felt as if he was on trial;his once blue high-chair felt as though it held him in place, a barbaric restraint for a barbarian. He squirmed under the lifeless, accusatory gaze of his former allies-- these once proud, dirt-caked, Lords of Soil and Grit now reduced to this formless, buttery aberration.

The dinosaurs on his plate also sat in silent judgement, their scaled mouths down turned in odium at the mangled corpse-pile held within their bowl. He failed to meet their eyes and stared at his spoon instead, begging for his hungry salivating to stop.

Heinrich had sworn, he had *sworn* to not become this monster, to stave off his based, involuntary desires. He had been a friend of all potatokind, a rare demonstration of the viability of human-vegetable non-aggression. And now here he was. A proponent of a different type of interaction, one that only benefited a single party:his.

It wasn't purely his fault,though. *She* was also to blame--it had been *her* that had made them tasty and buttery and creamy and fun to throw around the dining table.

At first he had had none of it. 

Not a single bite,nothing. He hadn't even allowed himself to breathe in the stench of such barbarity, his moral instincts had caused him to easily resist her debauched temptations. A swift report to the Potato Lord afterwards had reaffirmed his vigilance to potatokind, to them and to his own conscience. He had stood amongst the people of Pantryton and declared his undying love for their culture and people, had promised as long as this love continued, so would his protection. 

But then she had come again, this time with sauce. 

And, may the Potato God forgive his misdeeds,it had been tomato sauce. Rich, red, salty-sweet tomato sauce. Not even the usual stuff,mind you. The kind that came in a jar, not a cheap, rubbery bottle.

And she had lathered it on. 

Completely drowned the poor, broken bodies in it. The potato to sauce ratio had been insanely skewed in the favour of the sauce, and he knew it was deliberate. She knew how to play him, she knew his weaknesses.

As he had sat in his high-chair, he had begged for strength from the Potato God, but He had not answered his pleas. He had whispered prayers to the fallen before him,had planed to even hold a vigil in their honour, yet the sauce beckoned. 

It had promised his taste buds a pleasure so intense that his mouth had not been able to control itself, his hands had worked against his righteous might. And the sauce had not been lying, they tasted beyond anything he had ever imagined.

At first he had felt empty--a broken hero and a traitor whose insatiable appetite for sauce had caused him to break a vow that he had previously thought to be unbreakable.

 And then he had felt hungry.

His hunger had consumed him. Mash was being served daily, and he was devouring it like some voracious beast.

 His now pitifully weak conscious had desperately tried to cling to the virtues that had once constituted his heroic image, but its fight had been like that of a fruit mite's pathetic struggle to feed itself as its host apple rushed towards the school desk, both oblivious to their impending splatter.

Within a week, the entire population of Pantryton had been boiled, squished and eaten by their saviour. Not even the kumara had been spared.

He should have quit, he should have paid reparations to the now depleted potato village, he should be ashamed of this egregious slaughter.

Heinrich gulped down the last of the saliva and picked up his spoon.

But he liked it.
  





     




 Don't quite understand what you're saying,man. Are you talking about the suggestion, or the actual text itself? 




 Kind of a simple suggestion,really. I think that more variation in the way you are wounded in a fight with another player through a slightly deeper injury system would make pvp that much more intense. 

I suggest that the possibility of either becoming mortally wounded or suffering internal bleeding after being shot/axed/can-openered would add a nice higher risk factor to conflict. 

It could be as simple as adding another modifier [Mortally Wounded/Internally Bleeding] to the player's status after being hit in a certain area (chest) or by a certain calibre weapon that stays with them until they die from it, (it would be random,of course) or as complex as having different types of internal injuries (lungs,stomach,intestines) lead to varying times of death, with characters who have been hit in places like the stomach/intestines periodically crumpling/falling over due to intense pain before dying a slow,agonizing death a short distance away from where they were shot in contrast to characters hit in the throat/lungs gasping for air and coughing up blood whilst squirming on the floor. Accompanying animations/audio effects would be pretty cool as well. So would blood trails, but I don't know whether that'd be possible.

I feel that a lot of fights end up with both parties being shot, but only one surviving thanks to his insta-heal bandage, even if he was hit directly in the chest. Picture this:

Imagine you're scavenging through Elektro with a mate. You make a quick pass of the school but are ambushed by another player. Your mate is hit in the throat and goes down, his character gurgling and writhing on the floor while you are hit in the stomach. Your character falls to the floor as well, but you quickly make it back up and find cover. You can barely see as your character is in a great deal of pain/shock and you know you're about to die, but you decide to take whoever shot you with you into the inky black. You bandage up to stop the external bleeding, even though you know you're screwed anyway and make your way around and into the school--your character falls again as legs are failing him. You find el bandito smugly rearranging his inventory in one of the school rooms and blast the fucker. The last of your character's strength fails him and he falls into unconsciousness and the death but at least you got your revenge.

 Having a chance for bullets to become lodged in a character, requiring the need to be pulled out with pliers lest the character remain in constant pain and run the risk of infection,would be a nice addition as well.

What do you guys think? 




 Your accent changed halfway through,lol. 




 If /r/seduction and whatnot are to be believed, having a woman show interest in you. I can't even fathom how that would feel, or what I would do in the event that it did happen. 




 So would donating to this be like donating to a charity for the autistic or something? 




 Hey,guys. I've been studying linguistics at uni for about a year now and have decided that I would like to make my career based in the field of linguistics. I love studying languages, but I have no idea where I could go with a major in linguistics.

Any ideas? 




 It's not just plain pasta,though--it's got a cream-based sauce+bacon. How long do you think it would take for cooked cream to spoil? 









 Phew, I was pretty worried about that. 




 No,no it didn't. I know how I look, they were mocking me.

 Durrr...durrr, "this is why you're forever alone". 

Fuck off, you invalid. 




 MUH...MUH SOGGY KNEES! 




 Ya gotta be attractive yourself! 

Rule no. 1, mang! 




 It's slowly coming this way! 




 Gonna take some text from a older post of mine to give some back story to my interactions with a particular girl:

"Hey guys. I'm a bit new to this whole relationship-with-another-sex biz, being as I've had quite a bit of trouble with girls/women in the past and that I've never had a girlfriend/kissed/had sex/all that good intimate relationship stuff, so bear with me if I sound a bit naive or dickheaded as I'm pretty much running on a teenager's understanding of relationships. So, the story goes that I met this girl at a party where I was quite drunk. I found her quite attractive and so mustered all the liquored-up courage I could find to talk to her. We got on pretty well and I ended up getting her phone number. I asked her on a date ( I'm pretty sure it was one) a week or so later, and when the time came, I met her and I had a pretty good time. After that, I asked her out again to which she said yes. However this second time she didn't respond to the plans I made for whatever reason ( which I was cool with) and we didn't go out. We still texted however, with her almost always being the one to initiate conversation, as I was too terrified of appearing annoying and/or needy. After some time, we agreed on seeing each other again and this time actually did. It went well again ( I think), except this time I didn't press for another meeting. Again more sporadic texting continued( I'm not so good at maintaining constant contact) with her one day hinting at ( well, not really hinting, she pretty much said, " Let's meet up again.") meeting again. I agreed, we made plans, but we both forgot to follow through. Fast-forward to this week where I asked her out to dinner and she agreed ( as usual). After this she asked me whether or not we were going on a 'date' to which I replied that I don't mind whether it is or not. She decided that we should probably keep it casual, I agreed. I should probably mention that during this whole time communicating with her her I've been trying hard to balance the teenage urges of wanting to finally get my first-kiss/lose my virginity/have a girlfriend and my more realistic attitudes on the fact that she might not want to date me and that her friendship holds just as much value as a possible intimate relationship. So, I'm left wondering whether I should deal with these urges to get a girlfriend by pushing for a more intimate relationship but risk ruining a perfectly good chance at a friendship, or whether I should play it safe but retain a possible deep-seated pining for her to view me as more than a friend that may lead me to becoming resentful and bitter. 

TL;DR: I've been communicating with a girl and have developed a fondness for her but don't know whether I should harness this fondness and channel it into making a lasting friendship with her, or whether I should push for intimacy ( which I am severely lacking in my life)."

In addition to the above previous events, I decided a couple of weeks ago to invite this girl over for a movie marathon. She accepted and we set a date. Today I rang her to figure out when she was coming down tomorrow and she had no clue what I was talking about, asking, " What's happening tomorrow?" She insisted that she did want to come down, but had sprained her ankle and might not be able to. 

I've been noticing that it's been me initiating contact more often than not, and I really don't want to pursue this girl if she's acting with some kind of pity/discomfort towards me.

Sorry for the long post. What should I do?

Thanks in advance. 
 




 Go, g-get outta here. I don't even like ya! ^^^^^Please ^^^^^don't ^^^^^leave ^^^^^;-; 




 Maybe. 

I guess we'll never really know how it turned out unless they do some kind of follow-up video. 




 Well, he did kiss that last one. I'd imagine that's a pretty positive reaction from that girl. 




 Not really an argument against, though. If he looks like a monster yet still is able to pick up women, it's still a blow to one of the most common beliefs here: that looks dictate everything in a relationship. 









 Yeah. Norwegian is related to English but Finnish is from an entirely different language family. 




 Through Skype/ any other VOIP program ( teamspeak, mumble, etc) or through text. 




 *Drrrr...drrrrrr...drrrrrr* 









 Was that thing about condoms for raping players a serious suggestion? I really hope not. You should take a moment or ten to think about the consequences of this if it was serious.

Nah, it wasn't serious,haha. Just couldn't think of any more uses for gut. 

Requiring too many steps to get from bear to sleeping bag could get tedious.

Although I hope they would include more complexity, it's more realistic to think that if they did implement things like this, they'd probably be put in as quite simple, requiring maybe a single specialised workbench/item to turn say gut into string and hide into leather instead of a fully in-depth process. 

Still, I think it'd be awesome if they added in a complex method of obtaining certain crafting mats. 




 Dunno. From your post history you don't seem to be doing anything wrong. Hell, I'd go as far to say that you're potentially not even an FA. 




 In my opinion, hunting in Rust could be a hell of a lot more enjoyable if it were to be expanded. It's cool that they've added skulls/bone fragments, but I'd like to see more things added to the list of things you can obtain off of animal's corpses. 

The use of the whole hunted animal should be a defining feature of Rust early-game as it is pretty reminiscent of Neolithic life ( hunter-gatherers), and I believe that it could do with a bit of expansion so we don't just go from sticks and rocks straight to guns. The animals in Rust should be the most important resource for your average nekkid Newman, it should be an momentous occasion when you bring down an animal large enough to provide you with much needed materials. Therefore, I think more animal-only materials should be added and uses for said materials (including expanded uses for bone fragments) should be pivotal to the Rust early-game. 

These materials and their uses would be as follows:

Gut: Used as an alternative to cloth in making bow strings. Used for tripwires (?), rope, or anything that requires some sort of cord/string. Also used for food, to make those drinking bag things and makeshift condoms for better protection whilst raping newspawns. Pulled out raw from animal and needs to be dried on a drying rack.

Fur: Used for making warmer clothing in cold climates, used for beds/sleeping bags, can be burnt on fire as cheap fuel.

Bone fragments/intact bones: Fragments used for jewellery, tools (does this already), needles in primitive medkits (?); larger bones used for weapons, armour, etc

Hide: A replacement for cloth already obtained from animals. Used for armour, storage bags, beds, tents, pretty much everything in Rust early-game. Must be prepared before use, this could be ranging in complexity from actually needing to clean, wash and then tan the leather in respective workbenches, or to just simply using one new workbench ( say, a 'leather rack') to turn fresh hide straight into leather. 

Fat: Can be rendered down in furnace to make glue, also used as fuel ( pretty sure Rust already has this,though)

Meat: I don't know if some kind of deterioration mechanic is planned, but if so, it would be cool if we could salt/dry/smoke meats for future use.

Well, that's all I have for the moment, let me know what you goyim think.

Oy vey!  




 I can dislocate my hips at will. Only problem is that I've probably worn out the joints prematurely from my excessive use of said dislocation as a party trick. 




 I...I think that might be my cousin. Where'd you get this, OP? 




 Me too, man. Pity I'm in Aus. 




 I hope you're right,haha. She also might be staying the night, dunno if that's positive or negative. 




 Cheers,mang!

I'll probably post a thread afterwards depending on how it goes, hopefully I don't puss out. 




 Got any tips on how to escalate physically? I've invited a girl I've been talking to for quite some time over for an anime marathon in a few weeks and I kind of want to get a bit more intimate with her.

What do? 




 Awww yiss.

*Motherfuckin' procedural worlds.* 




 Don't know whether to be happy or sad about that. 




 Sweet Jesus.

You've got to let love in, not demand it.

Did you get that off the back of a fucking cereal box? 

It's all nice and good that you believe that we all have hope, and I'm not saying that old mate OP doesn't, but please don't fucking patronise the rest of us that are very well facing the distinct possibility of a life devoid of intimacy ( you know, that one thing most people, likely yourself included, take for granted) with that bullshit. 

And it's all well and good that you find it to be pathetic or sad that some people can't let go of the fact that they will most likely miss out on one of the most validating aspects of human existence, that is, the ability to give and receive intimacy.

Sure, I could go on a holiday, or fucking twelve, but I will still feel hollow, I will still feel like some sort of fucking freak. I mean, what really is there to life but to reproduce? It's a biological imperative that we breed, I can't just shrug that off and say, " Well at least I have done these other, objectively meaningless, pointless activities. Go me!"

Hope is for people who already have had a lifetime of validating social experiences to fall back on. How can I have 'hope for the future' when I can barely talk to the fucking cashier at my local supermarket? 

Do you know what awaits guys like me and many others of this sub? ( Maybe OP, maybe not) We grow further and further into isolation and obsolescence. We become the creeps and spinsters who either kill themselves in some forgotten place or die in old age and are discovered rotted to their couch. However much hope we can put into the future won't change psychological foundations laid on us during early childhood/adolescence. 

We're at the bad end of the bell-curve, and we've just got to deal with that. I choose to ground myself in reality, not fantastical pipe-dreams saturated with such blinding things as hope.

*ninja edit: Fucking shithead 'f's' 




 Don't worry about him,mate. He's just here to feel superior to us and delude himself into thinking he's actually giving decent advice. 




 Just a little. 




 Sure thing! 




 Gecko is not dying in space,comrade,he only on vacation. 




 I am shakin' in me booties. ^^^^^Pleasedon'tbeatme 




 Sure thing. The excerpt is 900 words; the whole thing is ~1400 




 Sure! I'll send it through pm because it's a pretty hefty amount of words. 




 Hey guys.

I'm a fledgling writer who's wondering whether his work invokes a concrete image within a reader. I was wondering whether I could give someone on here a piece of my text to illustrate. Any part of the text can be illustrated,I don't mind at all.

If anyone could do this it would be awesome. I'm not adverse to giving a commission also, if that entices anyone.

Cheers guys! 




 I like petting my own chest hair, especially my belly hair as it's soft like a gosling. No one else wants to stroke it however. :/ 




 Yo-you like body hair? Well,I've got plenty of that. No back hair,though. 




 I bought it late last year,haha. Been waiting for procedural environments ever since. : 




 LE SIGH 




 Man, I've been waiting so long for procedural environments to be properly implemented before I fully jump into this game. Surely having larger maps with more asteroids/other procedurally generated content is a goal the devs are working towards, right? Has there been any indication of them actually making progress in this area,though? 




 From your comment higher up, you look like a regular dude. 

I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that if you had actually, properly physically unattractive, your girlfriend would have dismissed any effort of yours to pursue an intimate relationship, despite how passionate you are, yadda yadda.

Your personality is attractive because you fit within the threshold of physical attractiveness that dictated whether your girlfriend would date you or not. 

It's fucking strange, you know, that people actually believe that physical attractiveness doesn't affect how you interact with other people. It's all well and good to say, "Well, my girlfriend loves me for my personality," but you ignore the fact that she was attracted to your physicality first and foremost, and then your personality ( although I doubt she would stay with you if you magically became an ugly fucker, personality or no.)

This is what normal people forget, that facial attractiveness initially determines any future interactions you'll have with someone.  




 Give us a picture of your face and I'll be more than likely to believe you. 




 But ya need a good face to get dem social skillz, bruh. 

In all seriousness, you can have all the social skills you want, but there has to be at least some physical attraction on your end to warrant an intimate relationship with someone.

I'm sure it was your winning personality that got you your girlfriend, right? lel. 




 Wait. Deres a pub night? Where at? 




 Oh fuck off with this confidence bullshit. People won't give a shit that you're confident if you have no facial aesthetics. 

Face trumps all,I'm afraid. 




 If I hear that fucking phrase again, Ima...sit here passively and do nothing.  




 I'm not commenting so much on sex as I am on finding an intimate relationship. Sure, sex is probably overrated, but I don't want a relationship solely for sex. 

To get someone of the opposite sex to want to be intimate with you is one of THE most important traits of being viewed as a functional person. 

People couldn't give two shits if you think you're alright for not having ever had an intimate relationship as it implies that there's something wrong with you, and people don't like that; they don't like someone like that hanging around them. 

 If you are just looking to get your dick wet, it shouldn't be that difficult, but will still require effort. Make sure you present yourself hygienically, lower your standards and go to a gathering of similarly aged people and start talking to women, not just the stereotypically pretty or cute ones. Talk to everyone. If women see you blowing off the less attractive, plain ones...and then see you only chatting up the attractive ones, you're gonna be seen as an asshole. 

I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, big fella: Ugly people, like normal/good looking people, don't like other ugly people. Just because someone's physically unattractive, doesn't mean they're going to be attracted to similarly unattractive people, and unlike said normal-looking people, I don't subscribe to the vitriolic delusions they feed themselves about 'loving someone for their personality'.*(Top fucking kek.)*  I know a homely girl isn't going to be attracted to me and she knows I'm not going to be attracted to her. That's just how it is.

I subject myself to nature, and nature is cruelly just. The reality of the situation is that there must be someone to fill in the opposite end of the bell curve regarding intimacy and those people are, generally, physically unattractive (disregarding the disabled/deformed). 

I am one such person, and no amount of "talk to everyone" will fix the fact that the sperm that happened to develop into me also carried certain genes that lead to facial unattractiveness/shortness. It's not my fault, it's not your fault, it's not anyone's fault--it's just how things are.

In the worst case scenario, I accept my painful fate of isolation and loneliness with grim determination. In the best case scenario, I kill myself.

That's just how life is,eh?     

  




 Tangible qualities like physical (facial) attractiveness? 




 How can you be proud of yourself when it's been made clear to some of us time and time again that the rest of society believes us to be worthless? How can I be proud of the fact that I repulse women? How can I be proud of that I'm basically the chaff of the gene pool? How can I be confident with the knowledge that the best I will achieve will never satiate my desire to become a normal member of society? 




 Fuck yes.

Add in procedural ruined cities to scrounge around in and I will jizz the jizz of a happy man. 




 Heh. Gotta look good for me coffin, mate.

I'm at PlusFitness. 
























 Oh for fuck's sake, man.

I'm not saying anyone is against me, I'm just describing a basic human attribute and how it can guide other human's perceptions; Face it, mate. People value physical attractiveness first and foremost. Why are you having trouble with that? Do you honestly think the way you look has no effect on how people respond to you?

And for every successful 'buttface', there were likely several, equally kind 'buttfaces' who didn't end up happily married. Do you think of them? What about that weird kid every school has that everyone thought would shoot up the place? Or the thousand other undesirables shunned and condescended by people like you, all the while being constantly berated about 'how that one time some random ugly guy got a girlfriend or something', and that 'looks don't matter, only your personality does'. 

Did they all 'suck as people'? 

And you still haven't answered my question, but I will for you: You didn't stay with those unattractive women because for all their 'personality' and everything, you couldn't fathom yourself actually entering into a serious, long-term monogamous relationship with them and went for someone prettier. 

Am I right? 




 No, mate. You gained validation from whatever positive social experiences you had in the past and with said validation, created a sense of self-esteem. You didn't make yourself lucky and successful with women, you were born into it through favourable genetics. 

Of course it comes down to looks with me, have you forgotten the fact that I'm ugly? My life has been determined by the way I look, similar to yours. We're just on different scales of the spectrum; people respond nicely to you because you're good looking, thus granting you self-esteem and validation and thus granting you the illusion of personal achievement whereas people respond negatively to me because I'm ugly, thus destroying self-esteem and giving no validation. Is that so hard to understand?

And how are my views on women disgusting? Because I don't patronise unattractive women by assuming that the physical attractiveness of a potential partner doesn't matter to them?

Also, you didn't answer my previous questions. Did you stay long with any of these 'physically unattractive women'? 




 I wouldn't for the very reason a girl of similar attractiveness to me wouldn't be interested in myself: Unattractive people aren't attracted to unattractive people just because they're unattractive. 




 I'm not a victim. I don't blame my problems on the world, I don't blame anyone for the way I look.  It's just the way it is. Fuck, why is that hard for people to understand? 

It just pisses me off when people who have been spoon-fed social validation through no agency of their own talk to people like me as if the reason I didn't have that crucial foundation necessary for intimate relationships in the future was because 'I didn't try hard enough.'

And of course you respond with anecdotes. Whilst there has been concrete scientific study on phenomena such as the halo effect/ physical attractiveness' role in social interactions, there has been nothing to back up your 'friends who are ugly but married' but your word, likely coloured by a variety of external factors. 

Look, if it makes you feel better about the world then keep believing that people's looks change don't how they are perceived, and that everyone is judged solely on their personality. 




 But you've been with pretty girls.

So you obtained validation from the interactions with them first, yeah? And with said validation you were able to go with some unattractive girls and then think to yourself, " Well, they're not that bad, but at least I've had these encounters with x, y and z, who were all pretty, so I know that I won't only always be with unattractive women." 

Did you stay with these unattractive women long? Did you marry one? Get one pregnant? Of course you didn't.

Face it, mate, we're all shallow animals. You can dress it up as much as you want behind illusions of liking someone's 'personality', but it your shallowness will remain and the halo effect will guide your interactions.

Someone has to die alone, it's only because you're in the average that you don't see that. 




 Well, you haven't actually seen me, so that's a pretty unfounded claim. 
I'm single for a variety of reasons, but my physical unattractiveness is at the top of the list. 




 
That's the dilemma, isn't it mate? To overcome loneliness, I'd have to date someone as unattractive as myself who would also find me unattractive. You reckon that's a good thing? No mutual attraction between intimate partners? 

It sucks, it does. I wish I could not factor someone's physicality into how I interact with them, but I, like everyone here (including those who won't admit it) can't completely dismiss how someone looks.

If you have to ask this question, you clearly haven't experienced what it is like to be unattractive. I, like yourself,like anyone,can't just stop myself from desiring physically beautiful people and start desiring ugly people. Fuck, I wish I could.

And I'd imagine most of those women attractive as myself face this same dilemma. 




 You have to be trolling.

Unfortunately, I don't think he is, this mindset is pretty prevalent among the average populace; if it wasn't some gracious deity, it must've been their own hard, American work ethic! Surely it must've been, right? 

They achieved all of this from the get-go as everyone is born equal, yeah? Except those disabled people, but we can just dismiss them, lock them in institutes and viciously attack any doubts about their miserable lives they have with anecdotes of some friend-of-a-friend who was disabled and banged a hot chick or something, or that dude on T.V who is happy but missing his limbs. 

It's the same with them uglies! You're ugly? You still got two hands, dontcha? At least you ain't as bad as them cripples! Get ta work n you'll be rewarded! What's that? You've worked hard all your life with no reward? Work harder,cunt. 




 Let's be honest with ourselves, big fella-- For every 'successful ancestor' there was at least one non-successful ancestor whose bloodline died with him/her, society is the product of an interplay between those that have and those that don't.

And you should feel better about yourself; people like me exist to pamper your precious self-esteem and allow you to reflect on the fact that 'at least you're not as bad as us.' 

I don't wallow self-pity, I accept my place in the world and I don't delude myself with notions better contemplated by those who were allotted a better roll of the dice. Please don't come in here and patronise those of us on the other end of the bell-curve. 

What do you think I could achieve, being as unattractive as I am? A relationship with someone as unattractive as myself? Someone who would also find me physically unattractive? Would you date someone you found physically unattractive? Of course you wouldn't; no one does. 

Get out of the mindset that you are the sole conductor of your 'destiny'.

P.S I exercise and I eat well, but neither will change my facial aesthetic. My legacy will die with me, but so will yours after a time.  




 Ah yes. You're one of them self-deterministic types, eh? Would you say that to a deformed person? To a cripple? Of course not. 

Well, matey, like how disabled people can't magically make their disabilities disappear, some of us aren't born aesthetically pleasing and no amount of nice hairstyles is going to fix that.

Thank the indifferent, random power of genetics that you weren't born like some of us, leave this sub and don't go thinking your position in life is entirely of your own doing. 

Edit: The fact that these two numpties are being upvoted makes me a worried that this sub might not be for me any longer. 




 Work out, dress well, keep hygienic, wash your face, style your hair.

Heh...  




 To any modders out there,

SE combat needs a little more variety, IMO, and I think the addition of some kind of cruise missile launcher for large ships ( think something like the US MK 143 or a Tomahawk launcher) would be an awesome addition to the fairly limited large ship weapon collection. I'd do it myself but I have no clue as to how to code and have fairly basic modelling skills.

Lost: Am only 5 ft 7. (fuck you, Italian heritage) 




 Wanna know what combat is like in Starmade?

There is no use for small ships; every ship you see is a gargantuan behemoth with enormous amounts of shields/guns/speed. Combat literally boils down to who can build the biggest ship.That's it. No manoeuvring, no clever building, no engineering custom weapons or ammunition.  And combat is all the game is really about, as you don't have to really worry about basic Newtonian physics/ resources all that much as : 

a. There is no Newtonian physics, and
b. Resources are so incredibly easy to come by ( stations, etc,) and building is as easy as Minecraft.

Meaning you can pretty much focus straight away on attacking other players, not balancing resources/build time like you need to in SE.

Sure, it has infinite worlds and logic implemented, but that's all it has over Space Engineers. 




 Oh, definitely.

The time frame in which I'm writing is set maybe a hundred or so years after the largest revolution known to the world of Wa: Gasin's Revolt ( Or The Fall of the Old Monarchy.

To paraphrase, Gasin was a wealthy merchant living under the reign of the Othenai Emperor in PL 1200 who overthrew the monarchy in 1205. 

Merchants of that time were required to pay support-funds for wars of the realm. The Emperor of that time was engaged in a lengthy war with a smaller state which was draining on the resources of the merchants. Gasin was the first to say, ' Nope, fuck you. I'm out,' and stopped paying his wartax. 

This caused an uproar from the nobility and the Emperor himself, who proceeded to have Gasin arrested. Gasin fled to a neighbouring kingdom and formed a group of like-minded merchants who then convinced the under class to rise up and depose the king. They did so enthusiastically and overran the state's capitol, butchering the Emperor and his entire extended family.

Gasin then took reign of the state, forming a council of other merchants to rule over the bits of land he kept from the collapsing Othenai Empire. Gasin and his Golden Teeth ( a term for both his actual teeth, which were gold, and the council of merchants he assembled) however went back on their promises to the underclass of 'every man has a voice' and instead established an oligarchical company-state called Authon. There was mass unrest again, but Gasin was lucky in that he was able to garner support against the rebellion by classing it as a rebellion of 'radical puritans', blaming the unrest on Authon's minority Axar population and the Church of the Fertile Womb. In doing so, Gasin turned the hatred felt by the multi-cultural underclass towards a single group of people long thought of as devious and insular, and avoided he himself being deposed. 

Such was the work of Gasin Golden-Teeth, First High-Chairman of Authon. 




 People call any rioters animals and thugs, regardless of their skin-colour.

One example quoting Britain's youth as being called the 'most unpleasant and potentially violent young people in the world': http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2024486/UK-RIOTS-2011-British-youths-unpleasant-violent-world.html

People rioting and looting are cunts, whether they be black, white or brown cunts still doesn't change the fact that they are being violent and anti-social.
 




 From the great expanses of tundra of Northern Othen to the moutainous heart of Firlon, the remains of Pre-Light society abound within Wa.

Most prominent of these could be considered wonders, for they are indeed marvellous creations of ancient technological prowess and still puts to shame much of what Post-Light civilisation has built. 

I'll describe two wonders here: one Pre-Light and one Post-Light

**The Mai Space Elevator:** Forever a mystery, the Mai Space Elevator ( or The Finger of Cotmiv, depending on who you talk to) remains the most intact Pre-Light building of the known world. Lying a few kilometres from the city of Mai, its condition is so well-preserved that is it rumoured to still reach space, possibly even connected to some other ancient structure in the distant heavens. 

However such speculations will remain  mystery as the elevator has been held tightly under the thumb of the Atcotmivrosht, the followers of Cotmiv, who deny all entry to the elevator on the grounds of it being a place not to be seen by mortal eyes, and their presence amongt Mai's senior council has made any possibility of exploration improbable. So the Mai Elevator remains untouched, gargantuan and eery as it towers above the hills of Central Othen, visible to the eye for hundreds of kilometers.

**The Pious Walk:**  An enormous procession of huge kneeling statues carved around 800PL, the Pious Walk is perhaps the most well-known wonder of Firlon. Each statue is said to represent some long-dead Huisa monarch, in total  numbering around 450 statues, all in various states of decay. The Pious Walk leads right to the old city gates of Ntua, ending it the unfinished statue of the most recent monarch, Boja the Seventeenth, who was beheaded during the fall of the Huisa regime in 1213 PL. 




 Dunno what Jackal is, really. 

He just appeared one day and told me he'd stay for good. When I was little, he got me to break the spines of my sister's mouse which was pretty hilarious! I gave the mouse to him afterwards and he put it on his shoulder and said he was Blackbeard and now the mouse is still on there but it's teeth are really long now and I sometimes wake up to find it rolling around on my face,haha. The teeth scratch me sometimes.  




 Well, Benny said he saw him. 

But Benny also eats the lead paint from the metal balustrade on his balcony.

My brother said he used to have the same dreams as I did at our old house in Haberfield when we were little but I don't think he's seen Ol' Mate since then. 




 Oh, I thought it was Gina, Piero and Bruce. 




 Hey guys, greetings from Australia: the land of VB, utes and wilful ignorance. 

Bit of a weird title,sorry, but I guess I had to try and grab someone's attention with pure, exploitative bluntness. 

Ol' mate Jackal's wearing my skin.

Well, not actually wearing my skin physically (at least I don't think so), but he's certainly not just in his own fur now. It's kinda strange as well because I thought he'd gotten used to me getting used to his worm-hair stuff ( Whatever the fuck it is; it's not really like worms, though-- more like thin seaweed caught in a tough current while it's still rooted to the rocks. Weird how it just floats like that.)

Anyway, I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions as to what I should do. I've tried asking him to stop wearing my likeness, but he talks too quickly. Always has. Sounds kind of like if you got three people and a goat and pumped them full of helium and then compressed them flat, letting out all the helium in one big rush. So a mixture of high-pitched animal/human squeals? Kinda hilarious sometimes. It hurts to listen other times.

I mean, I've known him since I was six, but this is the first time he's actually changed appearance. 

What should I do?

 




 B-but I have to fight the Dark One! *[looks off moodily into the distance]* 




 Hey guys. I've been following the CGCookie tutorial on creating a Low-poly mesh for game design and I've run into some trouble. 

After rearranging the UVs and preparing to bake the normals, a weird circle that only appears in object mode appeared at the base of my mesh. Seen [here](http://imgur.com/a4XMp9e)

I also believe that this mystery circle is screwing up my normal bake and causing it to look like [this](http://imgur.com/Z6iUd7I). Also in that picture you can see that the origin of the low-poly has somehow changed, so to bake I have to manually move it closer to the high-poly.

I've tried recalculating the normals, flipping the normals, etc, but nothing works.

Have I accidentally hit a button that I shouldn't have? 




 :(^^^^^why ^^^^^did ^^^^^I  ^^^^^click? 




 This was shot on the coast? 

Yeah, you don't wanna live there. 




 Not to seem rude, but where'd you get your source on the 25% statistic? 




 I'd imagine some in the East also wanted to revolt against Kiev but no one really acknowledges that they had any real grievance and just attributes it to Russian involvement.

But I see your point. Russia did play upon Eastern Ukraine's frustrations and encouraged them to revolt whereas the American colonists revolted independently. 




 My Axolotl and I: An erotic love story. 




 Yeah but without the French the Revolution wouldn't have gotten anywhere. You could argue the same thing in Eastern Ukraine: A small amount of Eastern Ukrainians were legitimately angry with the Kiev revolt and decided to revolt themselves. Russia took advantage of the situation and poured forth supplies and manpower into the rebels.

A lot of Western media seems to portray the Eastern Ukrainians as never actually wanting to secede and that the Russians basically manufactured all of the dissent, but I doubt the Russians would've had so much success in escalating the conflict if there hadn't been at least some grievance amongst the local population. 




 People tend to forget that the American Revolutionaries were also helped considerably by the French.

When you think about it, the scenarios are actually quite similar. 




 LIES! I've posted my pictures and I'm not attractive. I think I'm just one of the few ugly guys brave ( or stupid) enough to do it.

 Sorry,replied to the wrong guy. 




 I don't particularly give two shits if you don't think it's true or not. 

It was a story told to me by my dad, not to you; I just thought I'd share it, but you know...yadda yadda circlejerk/hivemind, etc. 

Next time try not to get all pissy because of the anecdote of some guy on the internet's father.

 




 The Aboriginal Languages of Australia.

Some of the most interesting and unique of the world's languages are found here (one of the world's only tripartite languages is found in Northern Australia), but one by one they are dying out. 




 I think production was around 1998. 

Yeah, all he messed up the caravan and the wardrobe, so my dad was called in to fix it. This story was more anecdote than criticism against Keanu. Just thought it'd give more insight into the fact that actors aren't these God-men that a lot of people think they are.

As I said, my dad's a pretty vocal guy and he was just swearing out loud to himself at having to fix something that someone messed up. He didn't know it was Keanu that had done it, nor did he know Keanu was inside.

Guess this isn't the thread to post the story in.   




 What? You can't call someone out on their behaviour? Is it because he's a celebrity? He didn't straight out say it to Keanu's face, he was just generally cursing as he had to take time out of his shift to go fix a wardrobe because someone had kicked it in in a fit of anger. He didn't know Keanu was there. 




 The guy wrecked the caravan that had been given to him, my dad had every right to call him a fuckwit. It was the film set's property and Keanu chucked a hissy fit because he though the Matrix was going to be a flop.  




 My dad worked on the set of The Matrix and has a few stories to tell about his experience there. Apparently, Keanu wasn't as nice as people today think him to be. 

According to my dad, Keanu made a general mess of his caravan in a fit of anger and my dad was called over to fix the wardrobe. My dad, being the verbal kind of guy he is, expelled a variety of obscenities, some along the lines of, "What fuckwit did this?" 

Much to my father's chagrin, the perpetrator of such fuckwitry was no other than Keanu Reeves himself who had still been residing within the caravan. On hearing my father's exclamation, ol' mate Keanu exited the caravan in a huff, but before he left he kicked in the door, turning to my dad and saying something like, "Something else for you to fix."

Probably left out some details as I haven't heard my dad tell the story for a long, long time, but that's the general gist of it.

 Top of the list would be The Illumination ( The Light of Toruzh, The Judgement, etc.) 

Two or three thousand years prior to when my story is set, the civilisations of Wa had reached a technological golden age. A number of space elevators had been constructed, transhumanism was the norm and Wa had finally established a equilibrium with its environment.

However, the sun Toruzh ( thought to be the eye of the God Toruzh by Eastern Othenai tradition) emitted a powerful solar flare that rendered most of the technologies created by man worthless and plunged them into a dark age lasting around 450-500 years. Countless hundred of millions died from starvation, disease and exposure as their machines ceased to save them from Wa's harsher aspects. Along with their technologies went all recorded data not written down, leaving the inhabitants of Wa still wondering to this day at what life may have been like for Pre-Light folk. 



*'Yes,
how can man see after such brightness?
What value does the light of hope have compared
to such beauty?'*

 -Author unknown. Pre-Light Era. 




 Contemporary armies of Wa make heavy use of projectile based weaponry. 

E.g. The Military Arm of the Authon Corporation equips its average soldier with a repeater. Repeaters are side-loaded, semi-automatic rifle-esque weapons that use a mixture of compressed air and magnetism to project small shards of metal. Due to the method of propulsion, projectiles from repeaters have a small range of fire, and thus regular soldiers are extremely dependant on artillery ( both static and mobile), exosuits, and melee.

Most heavier vehicles are equipped with larger version of said repeaters ( like the Monk-class MK.1 exosuit which uses dual heavy repeaters), or long-guns that fire a wide variety of spear-like projectiles. Other types of vehicles (land and air) also carry dumb-missiles, bombs or flamethrowers)

Artillery in Wa use traditional, Pre-Light powder-based munitions. Powder-based weapons are rare outside of artillery due to the rarity of saltpeter. That doesn't stop the armies of Wa from blasting the ever-living fuck out of each other with countless tonnes of explosive artillery rounds however. No one know how much saltpeter is left in the world, but it is used solely for military products.

 I reckon make it give a new type of resource: scrap metal. Scrap metal would be used for all those scrap weapons and helmets instead of metal fragments. It doesn't make sense that those items would be made out of pure,harvested iron ore.
