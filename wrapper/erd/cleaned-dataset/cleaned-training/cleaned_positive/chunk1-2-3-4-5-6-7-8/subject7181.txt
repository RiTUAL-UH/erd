 He has been suicidal for over 7 years, since before we met. He has been in therapy for years, inpatient and outpatient, tried out a lot of drugs, was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. He has made an attempt before we became a couple, said that he could not go through with it because of me.

We've been together for 4.5 years now. There have been good days, but the majority were bad. We talked a lot. That is one good thing, I guess, like he puts it "our metacommunication is outstanding". He is a psych student, ironically. He explained his feelings of vanity in deep. I listened and tried to help. Was compassionate, held him when he cried, tried to make anything going for him, helped him through assignments and work, when he had given up on it. And I understood. I am mentally ill myself. I've had suicidal thoughts when I was younger, still fight with self-harm. I really understand how this world can seem meaningless. I found my purpose and goals. And I really tried to help him find his.

I also tried to save him in some more practical ways which included physically fighting him to prevent him from harming himself (I am not sure about the rules here so I wont go into detail)  in a mental state where he has no other goals. He does not remember these episodes.   

I don't know if he is able to be happy. I mean happy in a sustained way, longer than a few hours or a day. I feel like he might be if he had a better girlfriend. Because there is one need of him I am failing to fulfil... I can't give him what he sexually wants. (I could explain that further, but I think it is enough to say that he can only enjoy it if I enjoy it. And that is something I fail to feel or act accordingly). This is quite hard on him, despite the depression his sex drive always has been quite strong.

He is often mean to me. Cold sometimes. Angry. Saying that he'll never have real sex in his life. Telling me that I study too much, that I am not really interested to him... I proposed to open the relationship, help him find a new girlfriend, pay a prostitute... he does not want that. He wants me. And I already gave him everything, so many free days and evenings, I gave him years of myself. And with some of the sexual things he wanted - my dignity.

Then he is nice again. This almost hurts more that him being mean, because then I see what I am scared to loose.   
He says that it is not my fault, that I am not responsible for his life or his eventual suicide.

I used to abstain from bringing my own feelings into this arguments ("I will be sad if you die"). I tried to find a way for him to see meaning in his life. One time he said that he basically repeated the discussions with his former therapist with me. Lately I've come to the point where I repeatedly told him, that I don't want to be a murderer. Because that how I'd feel like if he killed himself. He died because I was not good enough. 

I know from a rational point of view that this is probably not true (though the sex dynamic changes things a bit). And that all of this is not about me, he is the one whos life is in danger...

 I am a medical student and asked a psych professor what to do if a patient has gone through many treatments and still wants to kill himself.   
His answer was: "Sometimes we can't do anything to prevent a suicide."

He had no idea what he told me there... how it hurt. No one has any idea. My boyfriends former psychiatrist (I'll call him Dr. R.) was the only one who knew. He actually told my boyfriend that if he can't prevent it, he was ready to help my boyfriend anyway, support him while he is still alive. Dr. R understood. He was so relived when I emailed him, relieved that someone hat established a rapport with my boyfriend, that my boyfriend had let someone come close to him.  
That was right in the beginning of our relationship. Inpatient treatment followed (after I had convinced my boyfriend to try it). Dr. R. retired 2 years ago. I miss him. He was the only one beside me knowing and truly understanding my boyfriend.

And the only one understanding what I have been going through.

On good days I manage to do everything my boyfriend wants. And he is happy, has a thousand ideas, cuddles... 

On bad days he says that I am sadistic because I am keeping him alive. He asks me over and over to let him kill himself.

And I am scared that at some point I'll say yes. So all of this ends. I'd never have to have sex again. I'd have time, I would be free in my decisions. I am not a good person.

Thank you for reading. I don't know if I'll be able to reply to eventual answers... But I'd really appreciate your advice on my situation.

EDIT: Reading the titles of the other posts I remembered something: he has extremely important exams in June. I don't know if I can do anything if he fails them. That will probably be the end.  

**EDIT2: Thank you for your answers. I am sorry that I did not reply individually... I lack the energy to do so right now.** 

















































 Hi /r/buddhism 

I know you mostly don't like questions asking for help... Or x-posts. That is why I hesitated quite long to post this here... But yesterday he told me again how close he is to doing it (and that he feels good that way...) So I've got nothing to loose. I feel that my time to find a solution is running out. 

I am by no means an experienced buddhist... I just try to follow the path and help people in my life. Maybe you understand why I have such trouble to just let him die. 

**tl;dr: I guess all of this boils down to the question: Should I try to keep someone alive who wants to die? How do I find out if I only try to not have to deal with his death. Or only allow him to die because my life would be easier then? How can I make the right decision for his good. What weights more, his suffering being alive or the suffering of the people (his parents, friends, brother) who would loose a loved one to suicide?**

Thank you for reading. I don't know if I'll be able to reply to eventual answers... But I'd really appreciate your advice on my situation. 
























 Thank you for your answer.

I don't think he'd ramp up threats if I leave. From all I know I'd expect him to thank me for letting him finally die. It is what he desired for years... I don't know how long planning and getting the "courage" (I feel it is the right and wrong word for this) to do it would take him. Maybe a week, maybe even a few months. 

I thought about getting a therapist for some twisted sort of "supervision"... Who I could ask what to do about certain things... though I don't think I could still influence him if we separated. And everything I said would only be from my subjective view... not easy for a therapist to help someone by proxy I guess...

But if I understood you right you meant to totally cut ties with him?

I feel like this goes against my nature (eventhough I thought of it and wanted to do it quite a few times). It would be the equivalent of stopping CPR on a patient who still has a chance of survival.... Of course CPR is exhausting over time, but  

 who am I to prioritize my own wellbeing over the life of someone?

Most people in this thread are suggesting that I should just walk away and let him die... I don't know if I can do that... I am only 20 and about to kill someone by denial of assistance. While spending all my time on learning how to save people... 

I just want to do the right thing. What is right for him, his friends and his family. I, myself am not the patient, I won't kill myself no matter what he does or if he dies, I'll spend my life helping people no matter if I am happy or sad... Because "I" doesn't exist, it does not matter.  
























 This is a really accurate analogy. Thanks you. I guess the key is to not drown myself... 
























 1. I am sorry... Is there a fitting place? I can delete the question if you think it is annoying but I feel that would be unfair for everyone that commented...
2. I agree on the emotional and mental abuse... luckily he never did physically abuse me (he even asks for permission multiple times every time he wants to do something rough sexually). Why danger?
3. That is what he is saying too... and everyone else here... yes I have no legal responsibility yet. I don't know if that will change once I get my MD... 
























 Hmm... It is difficult to be rational with someones life... reminds me of ethics class (when is a person too old to get the expensive meds etc.)...

He is better now than when we met from a rational point I guess.   

He used to hurt himself twice a day, every morning and every evening. He now only does it when something upsets him, maybe two times a week (and he never remembers it)  
He was about to drop out of High School when we met and is now studying at university (with two majors, though I am scared that it is too much and he'll fail one)
He has a job, well he has a bunch of jobs, but this one has a future and is in the field he wants to work in at an international company. We work together there (got hired as a team of 3 with a friend). But he could do what I do, doesn't necessarily need me and our boss knows that I'll quit once I finish medschool.  
He has two close friends who know about his mental health and the situation with me, even the sexual difficulties (this might be the most important thing)

So I guess he is better. But he says that it only can get worse and "why not kill myself while things are still ok?"

On the negative end he now thinks that he'll never get "real sex" or a girlfriend who is "interested in him". Because I need time to study (means to him that I think that school is more important than him) and yeah the sex part...   
He does not seem to grasp the idea of ever meeting someone else... at least he tried with his classmates but it seems that most of them have a boyfriend, so he stopped trying...

Cost is only on my side. That should not come into the equation... but you are right I should find out if I am still of any use for him. In a perfect world I'd find a nice very sexually active girlfriend for him and then he'd slowly forget about me... 
























 I don't quite understand... do you mean sexually?
