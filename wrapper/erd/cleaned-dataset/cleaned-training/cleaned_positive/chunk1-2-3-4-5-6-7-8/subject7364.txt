 You are missing the point. We don't know the full story about why the kid was taken away, but we know the result of it. That's where the hammer should be falling at this point.

---

I was going to post links on CPS-related support groups and survivors of abusive foster care, but all I've found is some facebook group with crucifixes all over, and I can't in good conscience link to that. I don't believe that people who have been abused should be given more false hope in something that's being proven to be just another mechanism of control over the vulnerable by the malevolent.

Sorry, I know this isn't the time or place for that. The combination of these subjects is a little overwhelming, and something should be said about those emotions because these things are so wrongfully and heavily intertwined in our culture.

If something like this has affected your life, you are not alone, and a source of comfort would be to do something towards making sure this kind of thing doesn't happen to someone else. If anyone has better links or real world knowledge about changing this sort of thing please share. 




 Regardless of the reason why she was taken out of custody, those involved in making the decision to hand this child over to a maniac should be held liable, much in the same way the public is held liable in some circumstances if people get killed by cops while chasing them down the road or in a shootout. 




 DUI's are big business, just like locking up potheads is big business. Good luck getting any real support for anything that doesn't put money into political pockets. 




 I was deap sea fishing tied to a rig once during rough seas and went overboard in water full of sharks. I made it back to land - to the boat rather.

Thanks for the memory of that and all the other times I've almost drowned.

Sorry to hear about your experience though. 




 Got lost in the wildnerness of Alaska for about 4 days. Ran across a big bear who I managed to sneak away from and got chased by a big moose through the woods.

Fell on some slippery rock above Sitting Bull Falls when I was a teenager, just a few feet from the cliff. Had to lay flat on my stomach as people linked hands to bring me back.

Got an AK47 pointed in my face in downtown Matamoros by a coked up cop demanding my wallet. He got the wallet, I got to live.

Got chased out of Reynosa by a gang of thugs, came within seconds of getting beaten to death as the cabby demanded my belongings. All I had was a watch and a little cash.

Been attacked by gangs Austin, had my truck torn to pieces by a bunch of fucked up thugs. Managed to drive away from that one but in the back of a cop car. They weren't caught.

Got stabbed in the hip by a thug in New Mexico. Pulled the blade out with a bleeding hand. Choked him out with a dislocated shoulder and rolled him into a cactus.

Had to choke out a big stray dog once. Was getting choked by a big guy in a bar once, almost passed out before I thought to box his ears.

Chased home almost every day from school in El Paso. Beaten half to death several times, on several occasions cars stopping to help me.

Held at knife point for my wallet in El Paso during school lunch by drop outs.

Got chased in a vehicle by some meth heads with guns until I pointed a bigger gun back at them while sitting on the car door. They were talking vulgar shit to some girl in a convenience store and I told them to watch their mouths. When we pulled out of the store they followed us, got beside us flashing the gun, and generally asked for it.

Overdosed on alcolhol several times as a teenager, barely OD'd on hard drugs once but pulled through before having to go to ER.

Got stung over 300 times by hornets at once. Was bitten by a rattlesnake but it luckily did not inject venom. Apparently they don't sometimes.

Got pulled over by an intensely crooked cop in the middle of nowhwere outside of Corpus Christi. Having been in bad situations before I could tell this guy wanted all my shit and just to get rid of me. Wound getting let go because he got a real call.

Had a price on my head by an unmentionable group of people for fucking up their operation many years ago. Came close to someone collecting that price and fucked them up only to find out later that night from a friend of a friend that's what was happening.

Almost knocked off a bridge on I-90 by a semi outside of Del Rio. Was intentionally ran off the road. T-boned by an old tourist who ran a stop sign into a busy, divided street. Wound up with back problems for life but never got money out of it.

Fell from a ladder on the job because of faulty maintenance on the hard line I was hooked to. The eye-hook at one end of the line snapped and I dropped about 23 feet wearing 25 pounds of sharp tools. Broke my elbow and tibia and dislocated my shoulder and jaw. Never got money from any of this, come to think of it. Never wanted to ask though, just glad to be alive.

When my mother was pregnant with me one of her students attacked her and kicked her in the stomach repeatedly, yelling "I'm going to kill your baby!" over and over. Her own immune system tried to kill me and almost succeeded. Doctors told her when she was 3 months pregnant that I'd never live.

Had a gun pointed at me in Houston by a man who thought I was stealing stuff. I was just lost in a bad part of town (I have no reason to steal shit.. I make money and have a sense of dignity, believe it or not).

Not sure how many times I've avoided death by playing it cool in other bad situations. I could list more but they'd have to be too specific. I'm paranoid enough, and rightly so.

Trying to think of more general instances. Doctor doesn't think I have PTSD. Maybe this will help me build my case for him. Reading back over this.. man.. every day I stay in bed is a good day for me.
 




 Not sure what to think of that. When I was a middle school student in El Paso, Texas, we all took exams to place us ahead into algebra in the 8th grade.

I nearly aced the test, but because I was white I was not approved - because they had to allow a certain percentage of "minority" students into the class, even though only 1 in 10 students in that school were "white".

I've never felt the same about public education. That single experience pissed me off so much that I refused anything to do with education in this country in general, despite my own mother being a long time teacher of special needs children.

I'm a high school drop out with no college, and I make six figures today. Even though I live in Austin, my child will never have to know what I went through because I am working my ass off to pay for a real education for him from the start.

Fuck everything about this.
 




 Well how about that? Good ol' Texas Monthly with first hand accounts of how innefective the war on drugs is, from the perspective of an editor and pot-smoker no less. 

Arguably the best magazine you cay buy at HEB.

I would counter one point, if only from a different perspective.

Border patrol and customs agents aren't a humorless bunch when you get to know them. Their job is very serious, and watching them work is, for the most part, a feeling of tax dollars being spent on a professional who is out to do the right thing.

It should be comforting to know that they are not there to plant drugs on you, trump up charges, or otherwise attempt to take you for all you are worth - like the HPD or Travis Country Sherriff's office. The men and women of CBP and ICE have a no-nonsense approach to law enforcement that is something every LEO in the state would do well to admire, and the things they put up with on the job, and I'm not talking about the dangers of protecting the public against the public, are symptoms of a beaurocratic cluster fuck like nothing less than a war on drugs could produce.

I've been through that check point a few times. In fact, I used to work cattle and oil fields not far from there. One thing that I didn't see mentioned in this article was much about that country itself. It grows on you and when it does, especially if you grew up there, you feel a natural urge to defend that pristine, arid expanse. Areas like that are known for the pride the people have. That pride stems from hard ways of life and the existential victories that go with it. You can see this in the eyes of law enforcement in that region, at least those that grew up right.

--

Fixing my typos and grammar since it's in response to such a well written article. 




 That's not very comforting. 




 "Anyone know what's been wrong with Bob lately? He's been acting weird again."

"Ah, probably just another Carrington Event he isn't telling us about."

"Yeah, you are probably right. Good thing it's not because the Cubs lost again, remember that episode?"

"Hah! Yeah, he sent email to the *whole* *department* that time." 




 Thanks, this made me laugh. Have a single upvote. 




 I think you are largely correct, but you hold a common misunderstanding about the availability of jobs requiring Linux experience. There are plenty of them out there, you just have to know more than an OS or two to get them. If you happen to know even more, you are going to get paid accordingly. In metropolitan areas there is no shortage of entry level work at places like hosting outfits. In those environments you are typically encouraged to take flight and learn as much as you want about IT. Linux is just a stepping stone, another term on your resume next to a  whole bunch of other acronyms. 




 This IS a warning. 




 And no documentation. 




 I don't know about that. Nuclear war, even as screwed up as the world is, has far too much money behind preventing it. Greedy assholes know they can't take it with them and are likely content with spending it on this planet as long as possible.

The asteroid is scary enough, but the effects of an impact might not be much different than runaway climate change depending on how big the impactor was, and we are only getting more certain that severe weather is going to be the new norm. 




 Maybe in Psychiatric studies. 




 From the bench to the trench, there is no honor in what these people do. 




 TIL Big Oil's profits are inversely proportional to the strength of the American dollar.

That's fucking scary. If these people need the American dollar to sink in order to raise profit margins, I'm pretty sure they'll do what it takes to keep the dollar fucked. 




 I'm with you on that. "Alarmist" is mischaracterization.

Here we are, faced with a situation that we know could be disastrous within our lifetimes, but since we are't "exactly sure" of the date or the trigger, we'll just marginalize the research, forget about it all, and go back to watching TV.

Great plan, isn't it? We are a doomed species headed for a terrible extinction. It isn't a matter of what or when, it's a matter of how we spend the time we have left with each other.

Consider yourself hugged.

In fact, I think I will go over to r/christianity and pass out a few hugs. Life is too short to fault idiots for being the cause of our extinction any longer. 




 Many people here just feel that making women wear burkas is barbaric, and putting forth a cartoon justifying that in any way is counter productive in terms of basic human rights. I'm sure it will always be an option in the Middle East, but to western cultures the notion is just misogynistic and otherwise baseless.

Take GI Joe for example. However entertaining and inspiring it was for kids, it is still widely held as propaganda used to desensitize human nature and plant that early seed to get kids to enlist in the war machine.

Dunno man. Personally, I hate the idea of burkas or anything else representative of institutionalized control over a populace that is missing out on real progress. It has nothing to do with religion to me, nothing to do with race, but everything to do with exerting control over others. 




 If you're an adult with a respectable income, and no defaults, banks will not deny you a loan.

That's up for debate, and every bit of credit counts. If you are ambitous and attempting to make a million from scratch, you'll need every penny of credit you can get. Playing that game the right way and having a firm grasp of how our financial system works from top to bottom can only help. There is no reason not to go for as much as you can in life. 




 Peekaboo! 




 And make a list to stick to. 




 If anyone is wondering what Blue Rhino makes, you've probably seen the propane tanks in cages in front of Home Depot.

That's what the "thousands" of explosions are. 




 Scary isn't it? People willing to give up that law in order to feel safe - from the police no less.

Can't martial law be declared there in order to get the military deployed? I'm not advocating this, but isn't that possible? 




 I don't want anyone asking *me* for more money, and that's what shopping at places paying a $10 an hour wage for unskilled labor will amount to.

If people are out there making $10 an hour, that's roughly what, $45000 a year for a couple? I find it difficult to imagine that $10 an hour is going to get my already useless neighborhood back to work. If anything, if they do get motivated by it to get a job, they'll stay in that job.

I guess that's better than them stealing my shit though. 




 Have an upvote, pops.

Much can be said about the 90's too. As teenagers we saw the explosive birth of the Internet, the revolutionary grunge/alternative/techno music scene (arguably the last wave of good music ever created), and later we saw the World Trade Center's fall. Between then and there, we had aunts and uncles in the Gulf War, friends fighting in Kosovo, and now many of us are gone, lost to a prison industrial complex or IEDs in the Middle East; violence at the hands of others. We are a generation of slaves to a new era in monetary control over human lives. Our liberating moment was the day YouTube came on line and people, especially kids, from around the world got to share the world as they knew it with each other.

And the only people who will ever understand anything about it are people like you. 




 I paid for mine. 




 If these people could make a fucking pizza worth eating I might cheer for them, but 99% of every piece of fast food that I have ordered has been a sloppy mess, a mockery of what's possible in those state of the art food prep areas.

Fuck that. I did my time in a Chinese restaurant and then a pizza joint. Tired of being treated like shit? GO TO SCHOOL AND MAJOR IN SOMETHING BESIDES MUSIC AND ART.

In six years this country would look completely different if they walked out that door and into a political science or engineering major.

The sad part is that fast food holds up so much of our economy that if that workforce were suddenly unemployed this country would burn up in a fit of riots. An uneducated, unemployed populace is out there with a huge sense of self-entitlement, and now they are growing less content with their lifestyle idolizing wealth and fame because they realize they'll never see it.

Stay in school. Try harder. Keep trying harder. That's all you can do in this life to guarantee yourself any degree of success and financial independence.

Life is not some giant video game where you get paid for being on Twitter and Facebook or World of Warcraft. Life is ultimately about survival and *nobody* owes you a *fucking* *thing*.

I know people who have overcome serious mental, physical, and psychological handicaps because they wanted something better for themselves. They looked inside and saw what so many people in this country fail to see: a living, breathing, feeling being. People are so used to being treated like bags of fat born into a rat race of slavery to a credit system and a stack of rules against them that they forget what it's like to want to be free of it all. 

That's a feeling children have, a naturally occurring instinct that is being burned out of our brains from day one. Don't forget that feeling because as soon as you do you have given up on life and you are no good to anyone but the man taking your money.

---

Look, not trying to piss anyone off. All I'm saying is that if you don't like what you are getting paid then you have to move on. If you can't move on immediately, make plans, read books, go to the MIT website and get a free education in robotics. Something, anything but go home, sit in front of the TV, and chat with people on your cell phone. 




 I don't understand how a culture can emigrate to another country and attempt to push their values on the entirety of that country in modern times.

Presumably the reason for emgiration would be to better one's lifestyle, and presumably that better lifestyle exists within a different country than one's own because the original country is not satisfactory.

This makes me wonder if the original country that brought about that culture has a critical flaw. If so, where is the justification for causing harm like this? If not, where is the justification for causing harm like this?

If I believe in, for example, the slaughtering of sheep and nailing them to my door to rot, but I am not happy with my home town where everyone does it, what gives me the right to go to another town, rot sheep at my doorstep, and then complain when people get upset about the smell? I'd have no choice but to rationalize that the slaughtering of said sheep was a product of a flawed culture, and therefore I'd believe that I probably shouldn't be doing so where it is outlawed for sanitary reasons.

Jesus.. 




 I'd like my children to set foot on another planet.

And the technology for them to stay there... 




 Not to detract from the obvious, but there are a whole lot of people out there who refuse to eat at fast food chains or shop at Walmart and Target because of how incredibly bad those businesses are for the local economies - especially in smaller cities.

The last time I went to Walmart was a very long time ago and was out of pure necessity. I needed a car battery and purchased one at the automotive counter. The woman behind the counter was ragged, balding, and tough looking. I thought about how this woman could probably own a small business herself, and it must have been the look on my face that started the conversation. She wound up telling me she was just grateful that she had that job.

It hurt a to see the lines in her face deepen with each word as she told me that.

But that is the way the world is going, and there is no stopping it. One day there will be only 1 "company", and it will be merged with government. Each citizen will have their productive place in society. Sprawling industrial complexes will line the planet's waterways, and our great-grandchildren will be the architects, engineers, and labor - cogs in an ever-growing machine designed to rid the planet of our presence through scarification of the terrain. 




 And the vast majority of Actually Successful people are taking themselves too seriously to see that the blame does not lie solely on the lazy, unorganized, and apathetic, but with the greedy, powerful, and malevolent. 




 Having spent much of my youth in South Texas I can attest to how crooked the police are.

You are absolutely right. You are just one traffic stop away from having your life ruined when living down there. I've been beaten, molested, falsely accused, and had my otherwise clean name and record ruined by these kinds of assholes.

Now I'm all grown up, making lots of money, have lots of old and new friends who have lots of different types of high paying jobs.

And we all fucking hate cops. Some of them are even cops, game wardens, government officials, border patrol, all of these kinds of authority figures, and the sentiment rings true with all of them.

This isn't some immature emotion without considering their job, blaming a few bad apples, or any bull shit like that. This is real world contempt for a group of people hell bent on obtaining power just so they can abuse it. That's the kind of trash that belongs in prison, and the only way to put them there is to take their jobs away from them by getting people into office that you can trust to do the right thing. 




 They're making it sound like their hands were tied to do anything else.

Accountability is found anywhere but within the public education system. The only people that suffer the consequences of such ineptitude are the students trying to learn from a warped curriculum and the teachers that really care about the fact that their students are having their chance at something better in life ripped away. 




 teach these slimy sob's we don't just hand out blank checks anymore...

This happened in the US. Not somewhere else. 




 I am proud of working 50+ hours a week because its the only way to support all this:

My health insurance used to cost about $300-500 a month for my modest family. Now it costs $1200 a month and every fucking time I go to the doctor and pay my $50 co-pay I get another bill in the mail a month later from that doctor for another $50. And then, when bad shit happens, I have to pay $200 up front to see someone about it, I get the runaround and have to go back ever 2 weeks at $50 a pop, with the $50 bill later, and I'm still miserable with something very easy to treat. I shouldn't be put on experimental drugs that cost a fortune, and I shouldn't have $1500+ a month in expenses to do it.

I wouldn't mind paying that much if doctors didn't treat me like they were selling me a used car. I can't go "out of network" for any more "opinions' because that costs 3x as much if its covered at all or if the damn doctor can even do business with my insurance company to begin with.

Healthcare in this country is a scam. These huge companies have had *decades* to rig this game behind closed doors with more connections and deeper pockets than most voters in my state can comprehend.

To top that off I have to pay out the nose for anything unrelated to the common cold. I could either have good teeth and eye glasses, or I can have non-processed food in my refrigerator and the electricity to run it. If I neglect my diet I will just wind up with more health problems, and if I let the lights go out I'd have no way to function in this society that requires my attention at 8 AM sharp 60 hours a week.

Transportation, gotta have that because public transit in Austin is a joke. There's a car payment and another insurance company screwing me. Gas, maintenance, stickers, comes out to what? $500 a month on a good month of telecommuting?

Electricity, gas, water, and Internet! Gotta have it to live and work. $300. Food $600!!!

Rent! Can't live in the ghetto! Got a family to protect! That's almost a grand with even more insurance and fees up my ass.

Cell phone! Gotta have coverage where I spend my time! Can't use shitty, cheap carriers, gotta use something reliable! $100 a month, just for me!

Pre-k isn't publicly available here? Costs $700 a month not to have your kids beaten and molested in some inner-city juvenile-detention center equivalent moldy basement?

Kids got a cold? Tonsils? Doctor, pharmacy, surgery, doctor, pharmacy, doctor... Ear infection! $150 for 1/2 shot glass full of ear drops! $4/drop?? 4 drops three times a day??? Hurts daddy! Sorry baby, so sorry. Please take your medicine. Make you feel better. Feel better? See! Good! Daddy loves you so. Pick you up from school today!

Lost the job! Oh no! Savings? What savings?? Ah, time to sell all my tools! What? Can't do that because you need them to build stuff you can sell! Build it! Sell it! What? Nobody needs your shit you build? Nobody can afford it? Walmart what?

My living expenses are increasing by 10% a year and have been for many years. I eat shit food, feed my family the best I can, get into arguments with the warden about leaving lights on and the doors open when its 110 degrees outside.

Seriously - let me tell you what a typical dinner for me is like:

1) Thaw some chicken. Find a recipe in r/food. Dig up spices, cook up an amazing dish or four. Not enough for everyone - you guys go ahead. Growing kids! Eat up! Good food! Dad eats the scraps while he does dishes.

2) BBQ ever few weeks - cook phenomenal burgers, maybe some cheap steaks with so much prep in them they taste like 5 star food - dad eats the hot dogs.

No smoking. No drinking. No fishing. Got an old acoustic guitar though - and a little garden full of essentially sterile fruit from Home Depot to keep me from going insane.

Gotta have that A/C cranked up or I can't sleep. Gotta have a fan blowing on me or I can't sleep. Bigtime insomniac. Brain too hot at 1:30 AM. Make ice pack. Fall asleep at 3 AM. Miss alarm again. Piss off the team at work again. Grumpy dad again. Sorry kiddo. Let's make legos. Fall asleep on legos at 7 PM. Wake up at midnight, can't sleep again.

Need to see Grandma. Grandma is sick. Drive drive drive all weekend. Pack sandwiches and fruit. Overdraw bank account on Sunday for gas home. Dead battery and dog puke in truck, middle of nowhere. Call roadside! Worth extra $10 on insurance each month! $125 deductible? Take hot checks?

Locked out house. Cell phone cut off. Where's momma? Daddy! You got tools in the truck! Drill out lock. Home Depot door knobs. Landlord pissed. Quit coming to my home please.

Find a job finally. Great pay! In six months get back on track with bills! Oh wait, hourly pay. Work too slow, waiting on everyone to give me material to consolidate. Project behind. Not enough work. Mug shot on internet. Can't get good job anyway.

Find part time job too! Two jobs dad! Great! Momma sick, can't work, needs disability, doesn't qualify, poor momma. Flowers. Drawings. Make momma feel better, lets all give her hugs. House so dirty. Lets clean house for momma everyone! Fun! Tired. Miss work. Can't find keys. Can't find phone. Left badge at home again. 

Speeding ticket. Bullshit lying lazy tax sponge welfare bully cops too stupid to do real work. Insurance higher up ass again. Ouch. More ramen.

Sell TV. Sorry babies. We have a little one. No, won't sell your Nintendo. No way. Sell guitar. House robbed.

Car wreck! Totaled the immortal Rav 4! 150,000 miles on the Rav 4. Totaled! Get $4000! Give to IRS!

Tired. Bad dream. No, food poisoning from fridge that keeps going out. Landlord won't replace. Fridge worthless, food thrown out. Everyone sick. Sorry. Buy little fridge. Sorry. Love you, here is strawberries little one. Eat salty chips. Thirsty. Taste chemicals in tap water.

Need coffee. Too much coffee. Can't sleep. Coffee after 3 PM, bad idea, doc. Can't fall asleep at work again. Momma take them to the park please. Mania. Hide. Cry. Feel better. Read Reddit. World still fucked. Wind up in weird corner of Youtube with Crank Yaners, Nibiru, and Alex Jones. 2 AM.

One more day. Sleep all weekend. Daddy's so tired. We can go tomorrow. 




 What's worse is how there is no end in sight, regardless of who gets "elected". 




 Who's "Justice" Department would be? This entire country's leadership is and has been engaged in a reckless trampling of civil rights for decades if not centuries. 




 I can't wait for this to arrive in The States so I can die for an hour, get rushed to ER, and get brought back into slavery with a $750,000 medical bill for being hooked up to a water pump and a pneumatic press, and a Linux box.

Sarcasm aside, this is truly astounding. I wish it were around years ago before my loved ones lit off. 




 I never believed that the world was such a horrible and cruel place until I saw it all on YouTube with my own eyes years ago. 




 When I was skipping school in the 90's, I spent time on the Internet witnessing the explosive awareness and realization that our country is and has been all of those things, we just never had a way of telling each other about it.  




 Or just eliminate journalism all together. 




 Let's start with upholding the laws we already have - like that whole constitution thing that should have prevented this in the first place. If we get that far we'll have gone leaps and bounds beyond where we are at now. 




 Personally, I downvote puns because they add no substance to the discussion whatsoever.

But then, usually neither do my rants - but at least my rants serve to show others that if they feel the same way that they are not alone. I'm pretty sure everyone on the planet with a mouth and/or one finger/ear/eyeball can come up with at least one pun. It takes a little research to come up with a well rounded rant that inspires people to talk back or shut up and change something.

And if you are here for instant gratification period, then you really aren't adding a damned thing to anyone's (except for fellow karma whores) outlook on life. That might be something you need because you don't get enough of it in real life, or maybe not. It doesn't matter. What does matter is that there is so much going on in this world, and we have the means to tell *everyone* about it, yet thanks to fools like you (if you truly adhere to what you just said), that whole instant global communications technological milestone for humanity thing just goes down the shitter by becoming yet another tool for people to use to get attention for profit. I think of puns and the like as SPAM, and look at all of that as a symptom of an apathetic and selfish populace ensuring their own demise and/or enslavement.

Sorry. Bad day.

Watch *these* downvotes roll in.. 




 Should probably note that a good 90% of these roads are protected by Smith and Wesson security systems (and barbed wire). 




 Best greasy breakfast tacos I have ever consumed can be found here:

Order the chorizo, bean, and cheese tacos. Your body will get stocked with enough fatty enzymes to clear up a bad hangover in minutes.

Also, we make our own Carne Guisada at home out of Brisket anyway :)

 




 The people of West need to spread fliers around the town and nearby cities that show pictures of the people involved in the WBC.

Businesses can and should reserve the right to refuse service to these people.

For all the times I have been pulled over in Texas and had my vehicle dumped out for no reason, you'd think some good would come from that in the form of it happening to these assholes.

There are a lot of things that can be done. People just need to be creative about it. I don't want to sit here and think about it because I will come up with something so devious that people are not likely to appreciate it.

If I didn't have six months of debt piled up from being an unemployed IT guy, I would go. I have to work Thursday and can't get around it, otherwise I would be right there fighting for the people of West. They have a long battle ahead of them - many don't know that the shockwave from the blast knocked out the water.

It would be a shame if a caravan of truckers blockaded their vehicles from leaving the hotel again. 




 No need for chemicals all over the place. Use these:

 Thanks. At first it looked like the side of that building blew off and hit the guy's car. It was just the camera moving that made the effect.

 What would be the point? He's a politician. Shit he says doesn't matter.

Might as well be a dirty joke.

But, if I could get him to say something and mean it, it would be along these lines:

 I've had lightning strike about 40' from me and don't remember feeling heat but it rattled me hard enough to knock me off balance and made my ears ring for a while. You must have been like 20 feet away! Go buy a lottery ticket! 




 Someone has to pick up the convo and turn it into some kind of pissing match. Might as well be you, eh?

 has anyone else noticed that ____ owners in particular drive like assholes?

I've noticed that people driving expensive vehicles in general act more entitled to the road than the rest of us poor bastards. On the other hand, it's pretty obvious when one of us poor bastards quits giving a fuck and will just slam into your nice ride for the hell of it. It's not like our rust bucket is going to lose any value.

 _____ drivers appear to drive as well as you'd expect from someone who would be proud to overpay for a _____.

Give me a fucking break man. Do people really think like this or are you two fuckwits just bullshitting with each other to pass the time? 




 Edit: After reading some of the comments telling me I shouldn't be concerned, that it's "none of my business", and that this post is "creepy", I have to wonder what the hell has happened to our society. Ever seen a news special on a kid who fell down a well, or who was kidnapped? Were you concerned? How is my daughter's and my concern for this victim any different? I grew up in this town and remember it as a close and caring community, but it was no different than anywhere else in America at that time (the 1970's). We cared about each other and were unafraid to check on our neighbors. I'm addressing the critics here, what the fuck is wrong with you?

This sub is notorious for being snobbish, and represents modern day Austin adequately in that regard - full of it's own first world problems and devoid of empathy for anything but a trendy tragedy.

It *is* sickening. The things that have made Austin unique have been disappearing at the same rate at which overpriced condos downtown are being occupied. This is an eventuality, an inevitable and inescapable result of the overpopulation by the human race which diseases our planet. As downtown grows and the sprawl expands into the countryside, we'll witness the last of traditional values leave this city in search of a return to normalcy.

Personally, I moved back to Austin to re-live some of the times I had with my father as a child, back when Ben White was a four lane road, if that. Now it's 100 feet in the air and 10 lanes wide, and the roar of that traffic can literally be heard for miles. I'm here to build better systems for both the public and private sector, and feel that I contribute to what progress is being made in a big way. One day I will no longer be able to handle the side effects of this progress and I too will pack up and leave in search of a plot of land to call my own, far from the crime and noise and hypocrisy plaguing any city. 




 So where was this picture taken? 




 This has almost nothing to do with your uterus or abortion or religion. To split the issue up by listening to that rhetoric is counter productive, but it does serve to point out their methods, which is a good thing to observe.

Instead, it might benefit you to look at it this way:

Hard line republicans want more babies out there so they can force more religion down more people's throats so they can have more slaves to pay taxes and more overpriced junk from their corporate cronies.

So they can have more money.

It's that easy. The more informed people are of the larger agenda, the less likely these assholes are to succeed. That they have been abusing religion, perpetuating mythology to benefit themselves and only themselves, is painfully obvious these days. Instant global communication for the masses has brought this into the light and then some.

Simply put, these people have nothing to offer the human race in terms of progress which makes them nothing more than parasites. Playing in to their hand by raising hell over individual issues completely distracts from the unity needed to get rid of these people outright by nailing them to their own crosses with the letter of the laws that this country was founded on. 




 vee vee might be an asshole sometimes but those comments are usually articulate and well thought out. yours was basically a vitriolic and ignorant shart of a thought aimed at a political party for nothing but their political affiliation.

you asked. 




 Most parking lot attendants look homeless as it is. 




 They should use that technology to power Austin with all the bullshit pouring out of the capitol building. 




 Gainfully employed is an antiquated term used to describe living above poverty, and you know it - just as the word "theory" is used in such rhetoric to ascribe doubt to an established truth.

The fact that you like my screen name says a lot about you as well. It was coined in response to a shill pretending that our water supply should be privatized by foreign interests.

Religious foreign interests at that. Good ol' capitalism at work for you right there. 




 Keep teaching your kids and grand kids stupid shit. That's what will get you in the end. It will have nothing to do with euthanasia. 




 The only thing we don't know for certain is what drives evolution this far.

That's what the *theory* in your sentence is about.

Aside from the altruism I should display, if I were to meet you I'd probably strangle you. Then, you'd have no kids.

Theorize about that. 




 Take a walk off the beaten path between your XBox and the nearest GameStop, and you'll find that the world is quite different IRL. 




 The article is definitely light on details. It's not like they are going to go around releasing information about the dead guy that might imply innocence.

I'm sure if there is anything that can be dug up on the victim it will surface once the "investigation" is complete. 




 then this story title is only useful for propagating hatred of police.

That depends on your perspective, doesn't it? Some people will read that title and automatically believe the guy got shot for a good reason, while the rest of the waking populace that has ever had an interaction with a fucked up cop is entitled to their opinion as well.

Personally, I don't need a sensationalized title to make me feel any less safe around cops. The experiences I've had with the police have taught me all I need to know about them. 




 First of all, you are Reddit, too.

Second, this is a major source of consternation because cops get special treatment and we probably won't hear much more about it other than the sound of a rubber stamp of approval.

Third, if this were just some guy with a CCW, he'd be dragged through the national media and defunct legal system like Zimmerman. 




 One can always hope. Unfortunately it is never in the interest of the PD to convict one of their own. It's always better for them to cover things up, make the cop look like a hero, and downplay the whole incident.

I will be truly surprised if we hear anything to the contrary. 




 And people are pissed about a donut ad. 




 Definitely relieved. I had a wierd mixture of excitement that I might get to see more Calvin and Hobbes, and then a sinking feeling that Macaulay Culkin was going to have a starring role. 




 Wish I could just blow away anyone who I "felt threatened" by.

Wait, no I don't, because I'm not a psychopath. I tend to work out differences with others through rational discussion and informed debate.

I'm reminded of a story about a fast food place being held up by robbers. The robbers had knives and one of the employees had a pistol and a CCW license.

The employee overheard the robbery from back in the kitchen and debated on pulling out his gun. He sat for a minute and listened, and the robbers were gone with a few bucks and otherwise without incident.

He could have ended those people's lives right there in front of everyone, but he assessed the situation and reacted in a logical manner.

Just because you may have the legal right to shoot someone dead does not constitute a good reason to do so, and just because you "feel threatened" does not mean you are in any danger or automatically grant you that right.

---

The cop says he felt threatened so he shot someone. That's probably all the "facts" we'll ever get. 




 That whole "procedure" where mentally ill people are all thrown by a judge, not a medical doctor, into tiny rooms together to torture each other instead of being treated. 




  I can't say why we interpret more clashy chords as sad or spooky; that may just be society. My theory is that they set you on edge just a little bit more.

I wonder what the evolutionary purpose, if any, would be for this? I wonder if there are any subconcious cues in "clashy" sounds that relate danger to us. Like the sound of a gorge, the doppler effect sound of water rushing down the side of a waterfall. Wouldn't that sound look something like a trainwreck on an oscilloscope compared with one of these pretty sounding major chords?

If there is a lion killing a pig in the jungle half a mile away, it's probably not going to sound like a lion killing a pig if you can hear it. It's probably going to sound distorted. The more distorted and dischordant a sound in the jungle, the more my curiosity would be piqued, if for nothing else to rule out danger. That is to say, if it's far away and bouncing off of trees and rocks for hundreds of yards, I think those waves are going to overlap to create a cacaphony. 

By contrast, closer sounds are easier to make out, and I think the amount of processing necessary to identify the sound as a threat or not is going to be proportional to how recognizeable that sound is.

I think our love for music stems from a survival instinct common to any organism with a nervous system capable of responding to vibration. 




 Just what that part of town needs. Another 2,000+ people on the road. Good luck with that traffic problem and all that. I think these building owners should be paying to alleviate that problem. We all know a 900 sq. ft. flat up there is going to cost $2000 a month. That building will rake in 5 million dollars a month forever, and hardly any of it will go to easing the congestion they cause.

I am all for development, but it just bothers me to see things like this with no real plan for the consequences.

I love living in the sticks and I hate driving to town. I wish my truck had missle launchers on it, or at least a PA system.

Austin is all grown up now, but the kid inside me will never lose his appreciation for quiet, starry nights. This place is going to look like Los Angeles in 15 years and there is no stopping it.

So sad. 




 Boycott petty entertainment. Problem solved. 




 Once you start working on cars you'll also base your buying decisions on how easily acessible engine parts are. For examle, had I known I was going to be replacing an AC in and F150, I wouldn't have bought the #$^@#$% thing. 




 What a deluded mind. I don't doubt that SWAT faces some pretty serious assholes on a fairly frequent basis, but to compare the local meth gang to the Taliban is nothing but a blatant attempt to garner support for creating para-military patrols in our streets.

I'm all for nabbing bad guys and locking them away, but lets be adults about this. No-knock warrants resulting in one death is one death too many. Now this shit happens how often? We hear about the police tazing/beating/neglecting/choking/shooting/running over some innocent person to death on a daily basis in this country. People's gardens being destroyed by what amounts to a gang of gun nuts with a grudge who are no better than the worst of criminals. 




 Police brutality is at an all time high. Or is it?

Wake me up when these sonsabitches are all wearing cameras. 




 Not to mention midnight raids of hospitals and firebombing of schools, and all that acid getting thrown in everyone's faces. 




 Texas Brine really screwed the pooch on this one. I wonder how big this thing will actually get. Wouldn't it be worth it to send dynamite down in there in order to have it collapse all at once instead of sucking up a house at a time or whatever? 




 Yahoo has always struck me as some whiny parasite that feeds off of other websites in some convoluted and misguided way that screams for attention. It's like an overbearing, nerdy cousin constantly injecting their uninformed opinion into the conversation.

Yahoo is largely irrelevant in my life and the only time I use their site is to search for things that Google can't find, and 99.9% of the time they can't find it either.

The only time Yahoo matters in my life is when they excrete 1000's of tech jobs they couldn't support and all the sudden the market is flooded again with everything from java developers and dbas to project managers and help desk techs. 









 *No gators were harmed in the making of this film.

**Unfortunately the nearby towns have been evacuated.

***Because Texas Brine. 




 I generally avoid goading condescending trolls into presenting such specious rhetoric but sometimes find it necessary in order to expose the contempt such utterly worthless narcissism has for humanity.

More and more descriptive labels are being put on our food and there is nothing any PR can do to stop it. Move on to some other critical aspect of survival to exploit before people see you for what you really are and you have to answer for your despicable manipulation of the ignorant and disadvantaged. 




 Why are you trying to bait me into some stupid GMO argument?  All I want is better labeling. Maybe you could take a look at my other comments in this thread before trying to put words in my mouth. 




 The labeling will reveal only what is required by law, obviously. Organic vs GMO, is a false dichotomy, a construct of industry and profit. If this can of tuna came from fish caught off the shore of the Daiichi power plant, or this avocado has been treated with 100% organic cyanide, or this steak was grown in a tube in the labs at Dow Chemical, I am going to want to know at least enough to where I can do an amount of research to adequately determine the probability of safety, or at least err on the side of caution.  Any new law should go that direction rather than make some political point.  

Sadly most people dont give a fuck, and since I do then I have to assume I am being treated like someone who doesnt care and remain cautious. 




 We have the right to know what is in our food and where it came from.

This is one of the most frustrating non-arguments out there. This should be inalienable. My concern is not with some random food producers profits. My concern is for the safety of my family. Any eftort to undermine my decision making abilites with regard to food safety  constitutes a bodily threat and will always be viewed as such. 




 The downvotes are a sad indicator. What you are saying is what I failed to verbalize to begin with. Thank you. 




 What a stupid thing to say. Someone died here. Grow up. 




 Fried cod is what I'm craving. I haven't been in years, but The Fox and the Hound if Ft. Worth and Houston had fried cod fillets the size of your forearm. For $11.99 I was able to get three of those monsters put on my plate because I was such a regular and good tipper at the one in Houston. Love that place. 




 I've never enjoyed the tiny fish they serve there. I'd be surprised if any of them were over a pound live. 




 Assuming you are still in Seattle, and thus homesick, here is why I love Texas:

You can drive for hours out on the back roads of west Texas without passing a soul.

You can drive 80-85 MPH on I-10 from Houston to El Paso and probably not get pulled over.

You can go deap sea fishing in the Gulf or you can catch monster cats in Livingston or Amistad.

You can tube the cool spring fed Comal and Frio rivers when its hot.

You can pack up and head to Lubbock or Amarillo to catch a snowy weekend when its cold.

Beach, beach, beach.. Port Aransas is where I want to retire.

More BBQ joints per capita than anywhere in the world. I just made that up but it's probably almost true.

Live music all over the damned place, all the time. Booming industries, great paying IT jobs.

Enough TexMex joints in a given city for you to eat well, eat different, and eat cheap 7 days a week. 




 I started out laughing at this like an insane child and then just ended up sobbing. I'm going back to sleep. 




 Since radioactive water is leaking into the pacific and groundwater is contaminated in the area, can someone tell me exactly how this could get any worse? 




 1. If knives were more dangerous than guns then law enforcement would carry knives instead of guns.

2. If you are in public you have no expectation of privacy, hence the term, "public". 




 Glad you are presenting arguments.

1. More evidence is good evidence. For example: cops routinely confiscate phones and cameras and delete evidence. I can't imagine that's because the video would portray anything but the truth, or help determine the truth.

2. We already live in an Orwellian surveillance society. The FBI and NSA spy on innocent people and have been for years. There are literally cameras at every street corner. 




 This is a) why people shouldn't feed deer, and b) why people shouldn't feed deer.

I live in Austin and deer are all over the place. They are in people's yards where kids are playing, and parents think it's cute.

Deer are well known to harbor disease and parasites that can infect humans. Many wild animals do. So do house pets, but ringworm and that gondii parasite are treatable to varying degrees. Lyme disease is not well understood, and if you know anyone that thinks they have it or has been diagnosed with it, you'd stay away from the wildlife too. 




 I get it. Take the fucking deer.

Confiscate cell phones and delete shit from them? WRONG. 




 Thank you for the insight. Until today I did not know that the private sector was involved in this. I have to admit that I am a little shocked by that.

I hope that one day our tax dollars go to a functional enough law enforcement agency to allow for responsible and efficient interdiction of unfit parents without private interests even being given the opportunity to place profit ahead the interests of abused children, or innocent parents for that matter.

This type of thing is an isolated incident and is capitalized upon by the anti-CPS crowd to point the finger at a system that I believe largely helps the children in it's care despite the occasional bad press.

I am sure there are some very upset parents out there who are mentally deficient enough to feel that their children were taken from them unjustly despite the rulings of the court. I am also sure that the courts have unjustly ruled against parents, although certainly not nearly as many. Unfortunately there is no simple solution to these problems.

One can only hope that effective oversight will be a priority. 




 Can you ask him how people with no source of income could possibly wind up as even candidates? I might be missing something, I didn't see where these people were well off, but there has to be some checks there. 




 TXDoT says it has no money for this project – and lobbying for funds could take decades.

Settles that. 




 Sorry, but the CPS are backed by "the cops".

CPS needs a wash, that's for sure, but giving control over that organization to an already arguably corrupt and trouble-ridden arm of the law is just asking for more problems than we can predict. 
























 When I was a kid I got to visit a site where they had been pumping mud into the ground for days. I'll never forget what it felt like when the formation broke - I still can't imagine what was down there. It was like a bomb went off underground, dust rose a foot off the ground for a hundred yards around the well head as I felt my first and only earthquake.

I can't believe this shit is "up for debate". 




 that the school isn't justifying its end of the bargain

We narrowly avoided having religion crammed down the throats of kids that are already going to have it a lot harder than we ever knew. I'm with it, go to fucking school. Period.

It doesn't mean they have to like it. It doesn't mean what they are learning is true, but what it does mean is that they're learning to do things they don't want to do, and if that's not what life is all about I'm missing that point years ago.

Look, I can only hope there was more in a classroom today besides how to count and turn in a mediocre essay. There needs to be more substance that involves what the hell is really going on with this planet. The basics need to be taught earlier, thinktanks need to be assembled to cater to localized deficiencies.

Calling me a fuck up is like calling every kid that got a 6 year degree and has a substandard income a complete failure. It's not fair and you know it. 




 Next up: Mandatory Catechism, and the beatings will improve until morale continues. 




 Like a hot knife through butter,

Spreading my patience thin.

Killing me softly in a game of hard ball,

That neither of us can win.

They'll take what they can get, two miles to the inch,

It's not even really their fault.

Their parents don't love them, or don't try hard enough,

If they do it seems for naught.

Karma's the bitch, she gives what's coming,

What you do comes right back to you.

But if seeing is believing, and hearing is knowing,

We learn an absolute truth.

That time is on our side, these wounds will heal,

They'll grow over in a beautiful scar.

What does not kill us will make us stronger,

Just stare farther, a little longer,

Pulling horizons all the closer from afar.

Cheers my friend. Here's to the wavelength we share. 




 Guess I just gotta man up and work at it.

It's what we do best. 




 A winning lottery ticket so I can travel the world freeing slaves and shooting badguys. 




 no you are not an idiot, at all. you hit the nail on the head.

read it backwards line by line ;)

ok i tried the hourglass. reddit formatting screws it up. it changes the font, even if i indent the whole thing, and that makes the last line shorter than the second to last line.

i'll have to put it in a word processor and take a screenshot to get that right, but its a fantastic idea. 




 great stuff here. steamy. i can really relate to the way it's written, the anthropomorphism is outstanding. 




 meeting someone special is not as hard as it seems

especially when we like many of the same things

even when we agree to disagree in between

we both see its not easy being green

and when its time to come clean

when our qualities are redeemed

admitting what our dreams really mean

it's like nothing before ever believed or seen

when someone special is indeed what they seem



 




 I've found that the more you get to know someone the easier it is to come out with words that make time spent together so special.

Meeting someone new is challenging in that you have to squeeze the most out of those first few moments in order to produce something spectacular.

The kicker is, you probably don't even know your'e doing it. There is something about you that she already finds charming, perhaps its the very fact that you don't know what it is.

I've never been good at it, no matter the situation, but I've learned that few things are more attractive than raw wit and humor coupled with confidence and dignity. These are things I strive to find in myself, and when I do I come up with something terrible, funny, prophetic, or just plain stupid because of who I am.

Everyone is different and there is no better ingredient for a good time than to be comfortable with yourself. Being self conscious has always been a big problem for me, and I overcome it by being able to step back and make light of whatever awkward behavior it is that I am exhibiting.

Sometimes it just takes time to get comfortable enough around someone special to let it rip, and it might help to look at it like a buildup. You never know when the cork will pop in a conversation, when the opportunity will strike to make an impression or a move. It's the spontaneity that gets people together, and I'd say just keep that one thing in mind when your'e around her.

Live for the moment.

For you, bro:


Roses are red,

Violets are blue,

I am staring at your tits again aren't I... 




 callouses snag silk lingerie

grit from the days work smudges

eyeliner rolls away with sweat

moments evaporate into late hours

these delusions of an abandoned heart

that knows no bounds

and feels no comfort 




 Creepy right! Thanks for the topic. I wish there were more of these. 




 Like wine from water, gold from lead,

Beauty fills my mind, stuck in my head

Growing and spilling, out of my fingers

The scent of yours where it still lingers

Thick on my hands, but thin to the touch

Pictures lost to fires missed all too much

Your memory rises out of thick black ash

Fatal attraction, where rock and life crash

A scorned lover thrown from a cold windy cliff

To the chasm below where tides and sand drift

Carrying your body and blood out to sea

Where life starts anew, the end the beginning 




 At this point anything we can do to encourage kids to do better in school is probably worth it. 




 What's worse are the proponents of the whole "War on Drugs" which is perpetuating this kind of violence.  




 i bet if everyone in my building fired up IE at the same time that the emergency generators would kick on. 




 That's the only way laws get repealed though, for being too oppressive. If clauses exist that make a horrible piece of legislation workable then we are stuck with that legislation only to jump through hoops for the rest of our life. While I agree that something must be done to allow people to vote since this crap got passed I don't think polishing this turd is going to help anyone in the long run.

It's just a diversion anyway. [Elections in this country are a scam as it is](http://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1ops17/ted_cruz_failed_to_disclose_ties_to_caribbean/ccue8b3). 




 i'm glad you got something out of this. i don't typically tear into people but sometimes i feel like i can do something for the both of us when it comes to issues like this. i have a family of mixed heritage and want nothing more than for everyone to try to understand each other. it means the world to me, and the world to everyone else whether we realize it or not.

thanks for the gold and keep your chin up. you seem like a good person and i hope i wasn't too offensive with the banter. 




 that was a fake spoiler to draw you into reading an article about the women in your family. 




 thats actually what i was looking for when i found this article. 




 I think the train is going the wrong way. I don't know anyone in Dallas who wants to live in Houston. 









  Deplorable and discriminatory to you, because you're white.

That's an accusation, or at least a brain fart of an assumption.

 Do you feel that you own the English language and all meanings between people?

This leading question can be interpreted as an accusation. Why ask questions like this when you can just come out and say it.

 But don't try to defend everyone from themselves.

Don't accuse me of trying to defend everyone from themselves.

 The reason you call the N word deplorable is because it riles up your own white guilt.

There's another accusation. Textbook even. Go read that definition again..

 Don't try to put that on everyone else.

Again, accusing me of "trying to put that on everyone else".

Dude, get a grip. This is racist whether you know it or not:

 I am native american, how is it different than black people using the n word?

This is entitlement:

 Is this something else your culture would like to strip from us?

Nobody stripped shit from *you*. Wake up. You don't see me making generalizations about ancient history. This is the year 2013. You are a free man and you can achieve whatever you put your heart and mind into. It's like you want reparations from me. I work at 7-11 dude. Repair your own goddamn self. 




 Piss off with your baseless accusations, logical fallacies, bitter entitlement, and misguided resentment. The more you type the more you appear racist. I'm surprised your account hasn't been banned.

Good luck out there.

... "white guilt" ... What a crock of shit haha.... 




 you've had that brisket stuffed relleno and you weren't impressed? damn, tough crowd. i grew up in el paso, and corpus, have lived in dallas, san antone, houston, and now austin, and that relleno recipe is amazing.

the best relleno i've ever had was on a train from chihuahua mexico down to topolobampo. took us through the copper canyon and at every stop villagers would board the train with tamales, blankets, and at one particular stop, the best relleno i have ever eaten in my life. i didnt know they could taste that good. it was a very different recipe, but the flavor was outstanding.

when i eat somewhere new i order the relleno as a litmus test for the skill and dedication in the kitchen.

i'll admit that there have been times where i've eaten at Trudy's and it didn't come out like the first one, but that can be chalked up to the cook. the recipe is great, and that's why i give torchy's the benefit of the doubt in conversation. 




 that use of the N word is deplorable and discriminatory in its own twisted way. its ok for one person to say something but not another because of a difference in skin color? seriously?

how about i make one called "got_here_in_1624_and_started_stripping_things_from_the_natives".

hey, it's ok for me to use that, right? because it's true and because i'm "white"? right?

sounds good. 




 curious. what did you order? i only eat the rellenos but they are without a doubt the best around. 




 trainspotting. i've probably seen it 500 times. no joke. 




 Welcome to /r/Texas. Here is your keyboard, and here is your whiskey.

I have a story for you to lighten the mood.

Once upon a time, a Prince asked a beautiful Princess, "Will you marry me?" The Princess said, "No!!!" And the Prince lived happily ever after and rode motorcycles and dated skinny long-legged full-breasted women and hunted and fished and raced cars and went to nude bars and dated ladies half his age and drank whiskey, beer and Captain Morgan and never heard bitching and never paid child support or alimony and dated cheerleaders and kept his house and guns and ate spam and potato chips and beans and blew enormous farts and never got cheated on while he was at work and all his friends and family thought he was friggin cool as hell and he had tons of money in the bank and left the toilet seat up.

Edit: THE END
 




 You've beautifully illustrated how badly broken our voting system is on a mathematical level.

-Candidate A and B represent their constituents in mutual exclusion for party C

-Candidate X and Y represent their constituents in mutual exclusion for party Z

For the sake of argument let's say that each primary for each party is won with a 51% vote - essentially half of each set of constituents. This is then representative of 1/2 of the people being governed.

And for the sake of argument let's say that we have a huge election between the parties, kind of like our last presidential election, where there is a 51% majority electing the most important actor in the country.

We then get 1/2 of 1/2 of the people represented well. If you throw in the actual number of representatives and levels of voting, something like 1/2 * 16, you get what we have today: only the most influential of the populace being represented. 

That this group happens to be the wealthiest is probably not a coincidence.


 




 Had to laugh at this one. That is NOT a "rolling prairie". [This is](https://www.google.com/search?q=rolling+prairieclient=ubuntuhs=MSDchannel=cstbm=ischtbo=usource=univsa=Xei=U1JhUrPOFOOd2QWju4DADAved=0CE4QsAQbiw=1336bih=801dpr=1) what comes to mind when I hear it described.

Barstow, let alone Orla, are hardly what they used to be. There used to be enough grass to warrant regular cattle drives to Cheyenne through the region and support huge herds of buffalo. That hasn't been the case in 100 years.

There is a great TED talk by a guy who grew up certain that the reason for desertification was due to overgrazing. He even went as far as to spearhead the massacre of thousands of African elephants.

Later in life, as scientific knowledge expanded, he grew determined to undo the damage he had done by dedicating his life to finding workable solutions to desertification around the globe.

Climate change and evolution are not called "theories" because the fact that they happen is up for debate - the debate is how it happens and what to do about it.

It's a great watch and I have you to thank for finding it because I would not have found it today. Here is the full link:

http://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change.html

I actually found it on the [Circle Ranch's website](http://circleranchtx.com). They are settled up in the foothills of the Sierra Diablo mountains south of "the peak", and are known for copper, silver, and gold mining, and old drug runner airplane strips. As a note, yes the grass is pretty green there, but they are also situated on the side of the mountain. 20 miles east or west of those mountains is classic Chihuahua.

So many people agree with it not just because they are educated in climatology or part of some false dichotomy of politics, but because they've lived it. 

This is the same reason why Buzz Aldrin punched Bart Sibrel, only the place I grew up on became the moon beneath our feet 100 years ago and people pushing for pollution in the name of economy and profit are the proponents of doubt.

 




 Thank god our government doesn't work this way. 




 What I'm saying is that the place used to be a rolling grassland when settlers arrived, and it takes years of good rain for that kind of thing to build up.

It's not really relevant to west Texas, but I wanted to share [this image](http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange2/current/lectures/deforest/defores9.JPG) that shows deforestation in the states. I'd be willing to bet that regular rain was far more plentiful when those trees were around too. It does speak to the desertification of the place though. I think it would be difficult to convince anyone that less vegetation means anything but less vegetation, regardless of the primary cause - and not to mention the scale.

Again, digging up what I'm talking about has been difficult, especially since the last person who told me about how wonderful the grass was out there is 89 years old, and she heard it from her father in law. I did find [one of Camp Mabry] (http://climatediscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Average-Monthly-Rainfall-Mabry-3-Drought-Periods-copy-8x6.jpg) though, and it's not very comforting. The graph clearly displays a predicable decline, albeit cyclical, but a decline nonetheless in actual rain. If only we could rewind that graph for the purposes of this pointless conversation.

I'm just saying there was a hell of a lot more frequent rain 200 years ago over a hell of a lot more country than there has been in the last 100 years. I don't care what kind of cycle it is, the fact is that there's no sign of it letting up and when it comes to the well being of loved ones the obvious choice is to err on the side of caution and GTFO. When people ask why, well then, we tellem'. If they don't like it or they wanna buy the f*cking place, good luck to them. 




 I never said it was a lush forest, dude. I said it was rolling prairies. It being an expanding desert is exactly what I'm talking about.

Hauled plenty of pipe out to Barstow and I know what that "green" looks like, and it ain't grass. It's greasewood and catclaw. Hell, even mesquite will barely grow out there it's so dry.  




 I always get pounced on when I talk about it. My family made a fortune by the turn of the century and spent it all trying to recoup losses as things got worse. It's a touchy enough subject for me because I'm basically living proof of what's happening. 




 I don't recall saying the millions of cattle that died had to have died within some imaginary time span that you have ascribed to my words to benefit your argument. When I say drought I'm talking about this real meaning of the word:

It would have to rain for many, many years straight before that kind of grass returns to the praries out there. My father has an ag degree from Sul Ross and he told me some pretty eye-opening things about how certain types of plants will not return to that area until it's been wet for decades. It's kind of hard to ignore or chalk up to regional variations in climate when speciation halts and all but the toughest of flora and fauna have left.

Do I hope it get's wet? Of course. But like I said, I'm not betting the farm on it because the farm is already toast.

And stop with the name calling. It just makes you look stupid. 




 [This](http://a248.e.akamai.net/origin-cdn.volusion.com/xsbcm.qoply/v/vspfiles/photos/tx_pecos_43_terms-2.jpg?1353173056) is obviously a google maps view of some part of Pecos county, but very telling none the less.

You don't need me to google for the images. Zoom in on the Trans-Pecos region using Google Earth and you can see that sand colored space between the greasewood. 

[This](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQMhBSPrNpgsm2sK1PmYmp660LQaQUza4P2ltrRLsDoISELqZRn6Q) reminds me of the ranch the last time I saw it. Not sure where that picture was taken but it's eerily familiar. (edit: It hit me why this looks so familiar. It's just like the scenes in the photos from my family album when we lived south of Odessa when I was a kid)

The pictures on my father's wall are the most telling. They show what life was like for them in the 50's when things got real bad. The old men standing in those pictures are the ones whos father's settled the area back when indian raids were common and the land was, evidently, worth fighting for. It's $1 an acre today and the places I am familiar with, which is essentially from Marfa to Odessa (discounting, of course, the Davis Mountains, which are as green as it gets out there), are basically worthless unless you have the money to drill for deep water. It can cost $200,000 to drill a well a couple thousand feet and that kind of money just doesn't exist in the places that have been hit the hardest.

It's a sad state of affairs and it's not just Texas but this entire part of the North American continent is in for a big shift in population centers. On a long enough timeline, Corpus *will* get wiped out by a hurricane, and on that same timeline, sand dunes *will* spread beyond Monahans. 

Will it be in my lifetime? I hope not. Somehow I can't bring myself to bet against it, and that's for sure. There is no way I could consider hanging on to that land knowing what I know. Why on Earth would I repeat the mistakes that my forefather's made? With the abundance of technology and information, I can literally design a map set in a GIS application to show me the perfect spot to live given certain criteria.

People back then obviously could not do that, and now it's a humanitarian crisis as people die in the desert trying to illegally enter the US as much as it is an economic crisis as families across the west board up their homes and head for wetter climes. Ecologically speaking, there is no way to sustain the cattle industry that once thrived, and farming (as delicious as the Pecos canteloupe is), is no longer feasible even for the most prepared.

For instance, we had a few square miles of pivot sprinkler lines south of Pecos a while back. The wells were not deep and the only way to get a good flow was to drill down into the Rustler. We didn't have to do that because the gigantic operation across highway 17 from us had tapped the Rustler years ago and the flow was reportedly dwindling fast.

That's old water too. Check out some of the fascinating hydrology reports that UT has done on the area. Some of that water has been underground for 20,000 years, and now it's being pumped out exponentially faster than it is being replaced.

I could go on, for sure. 




 Sigh..

Yes, yes. Corpus got rain this year, and good estimates are that about a quarter of a million have actually died in the past couple of years.

But we aren't talking about this year. We are talking about 20, 40, 60 years from now and the long term trends preceding this disaster.

Right? Or are we going to go out and water our lawns every day because it rained last October?

Indeed drought comes and goes, but that doesn't mean we can't do anything about it. If people need to pack up and sell their land, there needs to be justification, and they have it now.

Even your previous reference to the THSA's site says:

"Information concerning pioneer-day droughts is sketchy because of the absence of official statistics; but data on some droughts, especially those during the nineteenth century, can be compiled from individual complaints recorded in newspapers, diaries, and memoirs."

They didn't have the Internet to share information instantly back then, and so went about with their lives largely noticing only that which affected them directly. Now that we know what's going on, and that this area is prone to years of dry weather, something *can* be done about it. We can prove it to the point of a for sale sign in front of the farm.

I really don't think you are getting the bigger picture. If you really knew families who have suffered because of this then you wouldn't be so quick to claim that because it rained today that there is a reason to keep the farm for another 20 years.



 




 Right. Because this erases my grandfather's, father's, and my own memory. I understand your mindset - you simply have nothing to lose if the south west does dry up and blow away. 

Many cannot afford to simply dismiss that possibility because of one side of some argument. As you can see, there is plenty of scientific data both ways.

But for my kin, living out there in the heydey, they'd tell you the same thing: It. Is. Getting. More. And. More. Dry.

Why would they say that? To scare you? Right. That's what people losing their livelihood like to do to other people.

Why didn't I think of that..

None of that "all this is perfectly normal!" crap is going to make bit of difference. Normal or not, it's getting drier. 

Do you think my family would have defended the frontiers of Texas over a pile of limestone and some tosajilla?

No. Mine and many other pioneering families saw promise in the land. They saw green, water, pristine expanse.

So when you call this ridiculous just take a step back for a moment and look at what's more ridiculous: people losing millions of cattle to a drought when there used to be plenty of water to support them, or people calling them names for trying to raise those cattle to being with.

 




 I can't stand how people doubt that Texas is headed for desertification just because we get *some* rain periodically.

When I was a kid Corpus was like a rain forest to me. Having come from west Texas, where it's *really* dry, all that green and rain was amazing. Over the 20 years that I lived in Corpus I watched it rain less and less, and when I brought this up to my father he told me that his father said the same thing about west Texas. Not that the place has been exactly a tropical rain forest in human memory, but still..

The Goodnight-Loving trail ran through the ranch land that we settled, and it was rolling plains of neck-high grass as far as you could see. Today that area is a parched waste land that resembles nothing that ever recieves water. Nothing but cactus and greasewood with the occasional mesquite and catclaw.

This place is drying up and people who have generations in this state will tell you. We don't need science to know that something is very wrong here, but it helps.

Sometimes. 




 Keep changing it up buddy. 




 I lived in the "suburbs" of Mentone as a kid. In fact, my family ranched in Loving county for like 100 years until it dried up and blew away. My dad tells me that he and his buddies loaded the last live cattle to be shipped by train in the U.S. outside of Toyah in '64 or so. The stories I could tell if I could remember everything I've ever heard my dad talk about with his old buddies out there. Even [crazy uncle Jep](http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bclayton/jep.html) is well remembered in that part of the world.

It isn't a crappy place to be from. I'd much rather be from a place where it took real guts and grit to survive than from a place where we are slaves to a modern way of life. I'd even live out there today if I had a way to support myself, but unfortunately for me there are probable between 0 and 1 IT jobs in the region. 

The area is pristine, arid, and isolated - except for the well heads every 200 feet..

I miss the big, rare deer, the rattlesnakes, playing with the scorpions, centipedes, and tarantulas. I miss the massive and most amazing looking thunderstorms only a parched desert can produce every couple of years. I miss driving around with my dad in the middle of nowhere in a 4x4 loaded with tools and supplies. I really miss living in the ancient ranch house that was literally 30 miles from the nearest human being. I miss exploring the sinkholes, finding arrowheads and ancient Spanish soldier spurs, coat buttons, and candles. I miss the gas refrigerator that was older than my dad but still worked, and I miss clanging away on the WWI surplus generator when we needed power, which was only necessary when we were building something like a shed or a porch or working on the old house. I really miss cooling off in the secret springs after a long day of moving cattle over the distance of several miles.

I miss the clear night skies the most. I know I'm crazy for wanting to go back, but it's so far away from people and their problems, and the air is so clean and feels so good to breathe that it's worth the pain to me.

Just my $0.02.

It feels good to see the area getting a little time on Reddit. Beautiful? Obviously. Hospitable? In no sense of the word. I've been telling people for years what it was like growing up there and sometimes I'd just get laughed at. Seeing these pictures brought back a lot of memories. They are a testament to how rough life out there can be, but they also depict the beauty of the landscape and the nostalgia of the working the oilfields very well. 




 In 50 years we won't have anything to worry about as long as we put the money we make from this oil into education. 




 Btw, that's not an oil rig, it looks like a storage site (I don't know the specific term)

I think it's called a "clusterfuck" in the vernacular.

 You people on the left get so butt-hurt by anything you don't agree

it's this entire perspective that caused the mess we are in today. that whole "you people" crap has to go, or we are just going to be in-fighting over petty bullshit until we really do render this planet uninhabitable.

in case you haven't noticed, the people you are sitting here bashing are your neighbors, your teachers, your doctors, and your police force, and in case you haven't noticed, this whole bi-partisan system has recently derailed to produce a gigantic cluster fuck of a government shutdown.

our government is shut down, sir, and for you to sit there and pretend like the problem lies with some imaginary line across the screen in the voting booth is as asinine as some of the fucked up policies YOU PEOPLE vote for. 




 How deep is the well? I used to work the last few pumps out on the Tunstill lease and constantly had to soap them.

I actually spent a lot of time there as a kid. I miss it for the night skies and clean air, but every other thing about that country is as forbidding and unforgiving as can be. 




 Try putting up a sign at that intersection about who to contact because the signal timing sucks.

If it's bad enough to cause people to avoid the light, the line will get flooded with calls while 37 people with cell phones sit there at a red light for 4 minutes - all. day. long. 




 I wouldn't complain, that's for sure. I might quit my job, especially if my boss needed someone to tell them to fuck off proper, and take the time to educate myself enough to get a more enjoyable if not higher paying job.

Personally, I'd take six months off to write some software I've been wanting to produce and/or start a different type of business that I've been wanting to crank up for a while now, but I have the bills of a paycheck to paycheck dad and have to work accordingly. 




 Along with what you are doing, this is what I'd try: 

Don't talk at all, but depending on whether or its due to illness or yelling, I may or may not try to clear my throat gently but often. For illness/allergies, I'd clear my throat and gargle with salt water every few hours. For yelling, only when necessary.

Keep a warm, wet rag on your throat to keep the blood circulating. 

Take some fish oil twice a day - bit the capsule and let it coat your throat, hopefully a small amount will work its way down there. 

Take steamy showers to get humidity through there. 

Take some ibuprofen to cut down on the inflammation.

Take some chondroitin and glucosamine vitamins. I think vocal have essentially the same constitution of part of, say, the knee, to warrant this kind of vitamin.

Keep oral contact with sexual fluids to a minimum... 
























 It's called Pico de Gallo in my house in Austin. I also make *chile* which is just green chiles, lime juice, onions, cilantro, and jalepenos or serranos, but no tomatoes, and maybe a little salt. Perfect topping for soups and goes great on eggs.

Good base for Pico de Gallo looks similar:

2 4oz. cans Hatch green chiles - hot or mild
1 large sweet onion, diced  
1/2 head cilantro, de-stemmed and chopped  
2 fresh squeezed limes  (juice)  
2 medium sized, ripe tomatoes, diced  
2 serrano (hot) or jalepeno (milder) peppers, de-seeded and diced  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
1/2 tsp. salt, to taste  
1/4 cup red chili powder  

This makes about a quart.

Wash all your veggies, chop them up, and have some good tortilla chips handy. This stuff doesn't last long.

Try toasting the peppers before dicing them, or adding different types of peppers (chile arbol, sweet peppers, habanero, etc).

**Note:**  Be careful when dicing these peppers, particularly habanero. You want to try to keep the nooks of your fingernails or any tiny cuts you may have from being exposed to the core of the pepper. De-seeding peppers without getting that stuff on your fingers is kind of an art form. Whatever you do, wash your hands several times afterward and do not touch your eyes or your SO's junk for a couple days.

Use of tomato is optional. I typically don't use tomato unless I'm making large batches, going for potency with the small batches.

Stuff is outstanding when mixed with hamburger meat for big burgers. They sell a variety at the grocery store here and call them Cowboy Burgers. Phenomenal on the grill with some Jalepeno Jack cheese melted across the patties over the fire.

Since I'm in the mood, might as well share a snack recipe.

1 leftover steak(s), sliced up  
1 package quality flour tortillas  
1 grated cheese of choice  
1 pico de gallo from above  

Begin by heating large skillet to med-high heat.

Slice up the leftovers and fry it up in some butter at low heat in another pan. Turn off heat.

Lightly toast one side of a tortilla in large skillet, adjusting temp to not burn tortillas instantly.

Flip the tortilla and pile on some chunks of steak, some grated cheese, and some pico.

Fold it over and place a flat iron or a pot on top of it at it sizzles in the skillet.

Flip it after a couple of minutes, flatiron, serve with sour cream and guacamole.

Unless you have a lot of leftovers, 4 or 5 of these usually only serve 1 - the cook. They're pretty addictive.

 Can someone put into perspective how much money this is in terms of research? What can realistically be expected out of these labs once the money is spent? Seems like they would be able to do cancer research on the moon for this much money. 




 Unfortunately, this is not about the unborn child. This is about the rights of a victim of a crime who was otherwise being forced to bear the child of the perpetrator.

 do you have a source for these statistics? 




 Good work takes me away for a moment. It makes me forget my day to day disposition. Really good poetry makes that fire on a cylinders and inspires me to write my own, and the best just leaves me with a feeling of contentment, of satisfaction for a good while like a drug.

So the question for me is, what causes the escape from reality that I seek when reading poetry? I like poetry that unwittingly gives away something about the writer because I'm sick like that. I like some poetry other's would consider mindless or drole when it tells me the poet is new to the art, or someone who never writes but has had something powerful happen to them, even if they have little grasp on linguistics.

Although I have been accused of writing narrative work (e.g. stories about pirates or something) from time to time, I find that "style" to be less appealing than the conveying of raw emotion in a context to which I can relate, such as pain from losing a loved one, or the dynamics of actions and consequences and regret. To me those are the most powerful because they offer easier access to insight into my own feelings.

This is not to say I wouldn't know a great piece of work if I saw it, but everyone has their preferences when it comes to taste in the opposite sex.  




 This acupuncturist had an entire wall full of herbs and concoctions. Like you say, she would probably claim to be able to cure anything.

Placebo or not, it set me in the right direction, if only for a while. That's what I needed at the time and that's what I got. Would do again 5/5, know what I mean? 




 When you are at the end of your rope you'll grab on to anything.

I had acupuncture performed about 15 years ago. For argument's sake, let's say it was to rejuvenate. The acupuncturist put me on a regimen of weird herbs, and she told me about a month into it I was going to get very sick, and that when I was better, all would be right.

The acupuncture itself was interesting. Peaceful music. Pleasant person to talk to.

Needles hanging out of my body everywhere.

I did get sick about a month later, sicker than I can remember ever having been. After a few days of intense pain, I woke up with the sun, feeling amazing.

And I never wake up early.

The good feeling lasted a couple of weeks. I ran out of the herbs and asked the acupuncturist what to do next. She said it was up to me to decide on how I want to live my life, that she couldn't do anything else for me.

That, to me, does not sound like a con artist. YMMV. 




 Yes, thank you... 




 no.. it struck me that it could be read from left to right or top to bottom, and i think the second version will have some words rearranged so you can do just that. as it stands, it is to be read from top to bottom like a normal paragraph, starting with "The night you...".

Thanks for bringing it up. It needed clarification. 




 Thank you for your comment and the link. I have a shell to break and this kind of thinking helps a lot. 




 Definitely going to work this one over a few times for the books. Thanks for reading!

 No offense taken at all. I take the subject matter to heart. This last month I have begun writing again after a 15 year block, where before I was putting out a song, story, or a few poems a day for several years, piles of it printed up around me. There were some real gems in there, lost forever in print, and I intend on recouping by incorporating this type of criticism into what's new.  




 Thanks - I caught that "an" right after I submitted this. It should be "the".

Someone asked me to center justify another piece in an effort to convey how the time spent with loved ones being described went by like sands in an hourglass. I could not rewrite the original piece well enough to do this undoubtedly common device justice, then this poured out. I could probably have started off by saying I am aware of how gimmicky this looks, as I did in the original post, but thought I'd forego an explanation this time.

Interesting how you find the second line pointless. That phrase actually served as a basis for the six lines, and was perfectly long enough to fit where it does with respect to where an introduction sits between the first glance and a warm feeling. I am also trying to convey how much that first impression counts, how an introduction is the inch given to someone special who takes a mile, and then some, thus: 'an introduction's inch more than a mile". 

I think the bottom half is kind of a train wreck, but if I allow myself to read it from the perspective of someone who has not yet, it doesn't look so bad.

Thanks again. Your piece, "To see is rare", is amazing by the way. 









 I am absolutely interested in editing and can get started right away.

Digging through some stuff for a submission now. Thank you so much! 




 Wish I knew about this earlier. I've never published anything and want to be part of this. I'd like to help with feedback or editing. I am a technical writer by trade if that helps. 









 10% off of their prices means you are still paying 89% more than their junk is worth. Target is an overpriced Walmart with the same crap but better looking packaging. Their meat, milk, produce, and goods are all imported from Slave Labor, Whereverthefuck anyway.

Fuck target. I asked my wife not to shop there for those reasons alone, and now I have thousands to deal with on my credit card because she just had to have some piece of shit bamboo picture frame or some shit. Fortunately I have a good credit union, the funds are returned, and I have a new account.

Yes my credit card got run through three or four companies in North America out of the blue just last week, right when this news hit. I've been using plastic for decades and have NEVER had this happen before.

Fuck target. They should be paying their IT guys better. Run a free fucking VPN client from your POS systems into your business core, use a fancy NAC product, certificates, you know, multi-factor AUTHENTICATION, and you wont have to worry about someone busting into your wireless networks, you money grubbing assholes.

I can't wait to get in on the class action lawsuit. Wouldn't it be hilarious to see the look on a tech-saavy judge's face when he reviews their internal security audits, their PCI audits. What a fucking farce.

 Have you read "House of Leaves"? It's a nightmare inducing horror story written just for people like us by people like us. 




 What an ending. Great work! I startled the dog when I laughed out loud with you. Thank you for that. 




 I love this. You've pushed alliteration to great limits, harnessing what I can tell is a wide vocabulary while capturing a moving story.

Mind if I stand on your shoulder for a second?

When wandering with whimsical wonders, where we will wind up,  
riding ‘round rattled roads reaping raging ruckii,  
fortunes found from friendly followings.  
Floral fractals flying from fallow fields,  
clouds communicating compounding colors, creating cryptic codes,  
manic mysteries morphing many magnificent marvels  
Slowly slurring specifics, slightly psilocybin-centered sentiments,  
throwing theoretical thoughts through the theoretical theme,  
idealistically identified in incapacitated intervals.  
Sentimental existential sanctified endings,  
but beginning by brotherhood bonding;  
systematic sight sought synchronously  

You cans see, I've rearranged the sentence structure by using different conjugations/forms of the same words to transpose subject and predicate (for arguments sake) while trying to maintain the original impact the words had on me, but the way you tie it together at the end is what it's about and very difficult to mutate and impossible for me to imitate.

Bah. I like yours a lot better. More!!! 




 This is so much.. There is so much in there dying to get out. Draw from this. I use this sort of thing in my notes to assemble ideas and produce cohesion. This kind of spoken word the aquifer from which the well flows.

Swim in it, bottle them up, and bring us back some more to consume. 




 Your work, [Can You?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/1gdski/can_you_thank_you_for_reading/) is a powerful reminder of my 19 year old self, and that style stowed away while I was out of commission all these years.

Stick to it is what I say. I let someone stomp out the flames I had inside me long ago, and it cost me my ability to obtain inspiration for a very, very long time - the prime of my life. It took the depths of a dying depression and someone nice enough to listen to every single word of self pity I could muster in order for that fire to rekindle, to restore my faith so to speak. As such, it would be very inspiring to read more of your work and I urge you to post.

Don't let go whatever you do. Find someone that inspires you to improve yourself. 

Here's a funny one to lighten the mood. It wound up being pretty popular here, another casualty. I will repost it in a couple of days so I don't get banned or something.

 Hi, had to check out your comment history after you complimented my work to see what kind of person you are. I think I found what I was looking for and hope these words offer comfort.

I have come to learn that parents already know how you feel. Telling them to their face may not benefit anyone. My parents know where their faith lies with me just as much as they know how much their faith has lied to me.

There are no easy answers. Time is your best bet. I know I'd never tell my mother I'm an athiest because it's a stupid thing to say to a delicate woman such as herself. She is elderly and can believe whatever she wants, and I'd have words with anyone who'd do anything to upset her condition. I am a grown man now and am past the detriment brought about by a religious upbringing, and harbor ill will only towards those who take the name of a deity in profit.

I think the real question is, what is there to be gained from blurting out hurtful words to your parents? Unless you live in a commune and/or are seeing people abused in the name of religion, it's difficult to justify the pain. 




 What a great compliment - wow! I am slowly digging up at few things I had deleted due to interpersonal reasons but am realizing there is nothing in them worth hiding from anyone. It's my outlet and I'll say whatever I want. I haven't written anything in about 15 years and its coming back with a vengeance.

This is the fallout left of when my submission history got nuked by a bottle of Fireball:

Exile is the best by far in my opinion. Check out [RAUNCHY](http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/1tef16/oc_raunchy_probably_nsfw/), work in progress. Might take a month or too to chisel away at it, so the feedback really helps.

Thanks again kind stranger. 




 Reposting after feedback. What do you guys think of my flower pot? haha.. 









 silicone sin indeed. great job. i can relate to this whole poem in a big way. thank you for posting.

there is a story of foreboding and mortal pleasure in this.

with imagery like this one day you'll find yourself consumed allright. keep up the good work! post more! 




 Thank you! This morning it started raining and it stayed dark, and that kind of gets me going. The thought of whether or not women blush in the dark struck me in jest, and here you have it. The one that flew out next made me decide to stay in today and write. 




 Too close for comfort?  
Too warm in the room?  
Too charmed to speak?  
Too much too soon?  


Your cheeks feel hot,  
Against my rough face,  
Your pulse is faster,  
Than my slow pace.  


Here we are,  
Alone this night,  
Myself pallid,  
Yourself alight. 


Naughtier words,  
Your skin flushes,  
Slowing hands,  
Your breath rushes.   


What does that to you?  
Was it something I said?  
Are you red right now?  
In the dark, in my bed?   




 As much as I love to tear up a bar, if I were living down there I'd rather have some distance between my home and all that racket. This is just progress. 




 Half the people commenting on this are getting downvoted. Why? What is it about this topic that makes people abuse Reddit's voting system instead of discuss the issue?

We are all entitled to our own opinion, and when it comes to things like this, opinions can run a little strong. I clicked on this wanting to gain the perspective of someone who would even question this inevitability. This is a FOX channel, not KLRU. Of course it's going to get worse. Like they say, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.

So now you have my opinion. Is it contributing to this discussion? In the sense that I am expressing my disdain for the further decline of our national media, but your question was about whether or not we should be concerned.

My answer to that is no, and it comes from my "slanted" opinion that FOX news pumps out bullshit propaganda for the rich and powerful 24 hours a day and there is nothing that can be done to stop it. It's not like the people who watch FOX7 are suddenly going to turn into Tea Party bandits and start rioting. If anything, this will alienate even more viewers, particularly the younger crowd, and to me, that's a good thing and thus no cause for alarm.

 




 It's been writing on the wall for decades. Look at downtown Dallas - that place is fucking dangerous. It reminds me of downtown LA with shanties propped up next to those skyscrapers. Sixth is a real shithole at about 1 AM on any given night these days, drunks staggering around looking for fights, cops everywhere, crackheads and crazies being pushy about asking for money. It's dystopian.

But don't say that too loud. You might upset all those people that moved here to live in those overpriced condos. 




 I wound up with it too a couple years ago and found it no more debilitating than the common cold. The "normal flu" was 10x harder on me. Lucked out I guess! 




 This is great. I am glad you guys got over it so quickly. I have little ones and when they get sick it can be scary. It sounds like you have yourself a real trooper there. 


I had a friend wind up in ER last week with a work injury who later dropped by to tell me all about his trip to the hospital. He said ER was packed with people with masks over their faces coughing - ask he is standing there shaking my hand, sneezing.

"Este vato!", I tell him. He's like "Oh shit sorry lol". I brought him inside and we dosed down with vitamins, green juice, and v8. The next night I started getting that familiar tickle in my nose and throat and thought for sure I was going to come down with something. I jumped out of bed and took 1 tsp. curry, 1 tsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. minced garlic, and 1 tsp. of cumin just for kicks.

An hour later I started getting a fever and feeling like total shit, but yesterday I woke up as if nothing had happened. My stomach bothered me all night though. Not sure if eating that much powdered spices is good for me, but I know one thing: I'm not going to ER.

My friend is fine but the rest of his family is really sick now.

 




 FTA:

In a news conference, President Vladimir Putin expressed no regret for the Pussy Riot members. "I was not sorry that they ended up behind bars," he said. "I was sorry that they were engaged in such disgraceful behaviour, which in my view was degrading to the dignity of women."

O WISE ONE: What do us mortals have to learn from this? Please elaborate on how we are allowed to love our Women. Evidently I have not built a large enough dungeon. If you could provide the dimensions proportionate to the number of souls I could capture, I would be forever in your debt.

Edit: Capitalized the word Women, because I respect that word. 




 I hate this bot. It makes me think someone had something comforting to say, which I would probably hate anyway. 




 That's a tough one, for sure. It get's across to me a few things and that is probably saying a lot.

Your concentration on the details that drive action are what make it. This is a real hit. In my perspective there's an endless supply, but I'm begnning to wonder if it fades, so I can stick with this. 




 I wrote a term paper criticizing the college for using antiquated and proprietary, costly software in an educational environment, and got promptly kicked the fuck out.

 I have proof of this. The farther away I get from my ex the better our relationship has become. 
























 To say so is to imply knowledge of the unknown.

I have a headache now. Thanks. 




 Those two things, aaand we could stop wrapping tiny SD memory cards in gigantic plastic boxes.

Everything we eat is wrapped in plastic. Why? Where is this shortage of oil when I have to sever a fucking artery trying to get some theft-deterring crap off of something I buy? 




 Try to understand why the thought of eating meat makes you sick and go from there.

It's like quitting smoking. I had to reach deep to understand that cigarettes are manufactured by a bunch of assholes that want me to die a slow death and take my money in the process.

Normally I'd get pissed at someone who is trying to kill and rob me, so I went with that. Fuck those guys, and fuck their products.

 I like how some people have a sense of humor about this, while some do not.

For example, I wanted to see some jokes about this guy in here. I found some. It was worth having to read through the predictable "discussion" before I got here.



 




 he sits around all day and waits for software updates. 




 While what you say may or may not be true, it's how you say it that makes the difference.

For example, all everyone wants deep down is peace and survival, but people obviously don't know how to say it.

IMHO they should all apologize to each other and cure cancer already. 




 I like how they serve breakfast for lunch on Mondays.

 This should be the top comment.

Dell images don't ship with FF. And they won't until they strike a deal with Mozilla, which is never.
You call in, a tech starts a service request, remotes into your computer and then downloads and installs it for that dumbass customer. The tech then follows up with that retard for a couple of days per Dell policy.
Shit costs money, yo.

Spoken like a true Dell employee. 




 Is nothing sacred? I don't see what the big deal is. If the UK wants to cough up that much money to Dell over this, fine with me. I live in Austin.

Why not just send out a fucking email with a hyperlink to a local copy? How much could that really cost? Aren't we talking about a light bill here? Someone call XKCD. I want answers!

Seriously though.. not all of that money is leaving the Isles. 



 




 It's still bullshit. 




 30 years ago they were still catching big tarpon from the beach. Nobody has even *seen* a sawfish in Texas waters since 1984, and only three have been caught since 1971. There used to be a gigantic species of trout that thrived in the gulf that hasn't been seen there in 50 years. They are only known to live in the Pacific now and keeping one will land you in a Mexican prison. Kings have had a do-not-eat notice out on them for years running, at least out of Corpus, and although catch rates in the gulf are relatively stable, I spent several weekends last May and June at Packery Channel and did not see a *single* king caught, which was incredibly unusual given the tried and true methods used to hook them from the jetties. Kings will probably never be threatened because they are so hardy, but that notion kind of scares me when I see a startling inconsistency in catch rates from prime spots.

It's easy to be optimistic when you can limit out on fishery reds before the sun rises over a laguna, or nail big stripers from a limestone bank at Amistad, but the bigger picture is not just one of dwindling variety but large scale endangerment and extinction of those species that are not actively sustained.

Low expectations are why people don't fish. Anyone can go to a pawn shop and get a rig for $20 or much less.

Not trying to be argumentative btw. Just pointing out some facts that seem to indicate that you need to know what you are doing if you expect to catch dinner.




 




 Much of the problem with south Texas in particular, and this is a bit anecdotal so stick with me for a second, is that for many years during the birth of the nuclear age, radium and uranium mine tailings were dumped into the rivers south of San Antonio, absolutely devastating the PPM life count in those rivers. Source: my biology instructor at Del Mar college. Guy was really close to becoming my step father so I got quite an ear full from him about the whole ordeal. I forget the exact figures but if memory serves the was something like a 98% reduction in this "life count", down to just a couple of hundred PPM between the 40's and the 60's.

Mining is about to destroy the gulf coast. Permits have been granted to resume uranium mining up and down the area, huge swaths spanning multiple watersheds, from just south east of Houston all the way around to the Rio Grande along the shelf.

I only have a moment to get all that out and I'm sorry I don't have good sources for you, but if there is any truth to it, it's still pretty disconcerting if not terrifying.

What can be done? Pretty much nothing. It's gone to hell in a hand basket already.

---

The other half of this radioactive coin is, of course, agricultural runoff that has had 100 years to build up algal populations that when in bloom have the potential to devastate ecosystems, both fresh and salt water. Much of our Texas economy is based on agriculture, and with more mouths to feed and productivity being held in higher regard than eco-friendliness, even if there were a way to put a stop to the mining, runoff would still be there to kill away what's left.

It's a no win situation. Use less chemicals in farming means less production, less money, and ultimately joblessness. No mining, big companies leave an already natural-resource dependent job market, particularly along the gulf coast. I grew up out there and had to leave the area to find decent work, and it breaks my heart to think that I'll never be able to go back with a good enough job to make ends meet without killing myself in the process.

I could be all wrong about this, but it's what I read day in and day out, where I've been down there, what I've seen working in the oil fields and ranches and learned in school with my own eyes that is truly disheartening.

---

Turning it around will involve nothing but a waiting game as more and more environmentally friendly politicians are put into office by an increasing population of people who are increasingly affected by this, for lack of a better word, catastrophe. It's going to take time to get those people there, and then it will be another generation who will perform the cleanup. As science advances technology in this regard at a snail's pace, my conservative estimate is that we'll be catching 10' tarpon in the gulf off of the beach again in about 150 years.

---

This is to say nothing of the tens of thousands of largely unmaintained well heads sitting in the gulf... if you've ever tied off to rigs out there on a bright and sunny day to catch some snapper, you'd notice a sheen or two when the water is calm.
 




 Thanks Vee. 

I don't take the subject lightly, and I base my work schedule on the water conditions 
(screw the weather) around Port Aransas because it's often the only thing to keep me from going postal. If my boss were smart he'd make everyone in the company join the CCA.
 




 As someone who has lived in Texas for 30 years and has spent a few up north, freshwater fishing in Texas is almost pointless. Unless you know exactly where to go, and have a boat to get there, you are not likely to catch anything worth eating unless you spend a week wading around in a polluted river.

Sure there are some huge catfish in our lakes and a fair amount of gar to be had, but let's face it. There are not nearly as many clean spots to fish as there were when I was a kid.

Even the gulf is getting to the point where nothing to be had is worth taking. Sharks are getting smaller and reef fish less common, and things like king mackeral are few and far between.

The fisheries supporting red drum and their kin are all that I have left. When I go fishing I look for these places and do my best to get close to them. Brown tide and weeds and generally poor visibility plague the gulf coast and it's estuaries. Few and far between are the days of green water to see through to the bottom of the jetties.

Amistad has some nice catfish, and I know some record breaking bass anglers. But those catfish take time and they dont always bite, and those anglers are all but strangers.


Sorry.. I just wish more could be done to protect the very water these fish are supposed to live in. For 10,000 years Indians thrived on these wild and untamed rivers and streams. If one were to drink a full glass of water from the Rio Grande you'd probably wind up in the hospital for a week.

---

It's not the lack of tackle keeping me from fishing, it's the lack of FISH.

Interesting. I was in a really shitty mood when I started in on this little rant, but just the thought of going fishing made me feel better... 




 Crazy. I was hit up for an IT job at JP Morgan a while back and told them I'd rather kill myself than work for them.

Looks like I'm not alone. 




 WELL THAT CANT BE GOOD 




 had breakfast there today myself. being from corpus, when i travel i really do start to crave their food. nothing beats a double meat double cheese whataburger jr with bacon and grilled jalepenos and grilled onions.. except two of them. 




 Just goes to show how shitty contemporary music is. 




 i have officially seen it all. 




 Your ad-hominem attack is unfounded. I suspect you have ulterior motives yourself.

What, then, are these protests about? 

Is it too much: 

police brutality,  
police state,  
wealth in the wrong hands,  
taxation,  
corruption,  
oppression,  
government...  no wait that doesn't work. 

Or is it about too little:  
money,  
food,  
work,  
water,  
rights,  
essentials,  
government,  
representation... again, no dice because violence is inherently **about** inequality.

I had to say something and will probably get my ass handed to me, but I'd be interested to see what the motives of violent protesters really are if they are not about being cornerned like an animal at the hands of absolute power. 

Spin it DJ.

 




 If there is a product that is a huge benefit to society, like magic apples that can feed families, then that sort of thing needs to be taken OUT of private hands. Privatizing essentials of this hypothetical nature is an absolutely horrible idea, and it leads to situations to... wait for it... a corporate monopoly. Personally, I'd much rather have accountability, unfortunately government today is anything but. You throw legislation-mandated profit for multimilionaires in there and it becomes a ticking time bomb of a situation. Just look at the price of *everything* we buy from private hands. If it's expensive in private hands, it goes into someone's pocket. If it's expensive in government hands, it's mismanagement of funds.

Shit like Netflix, however, can suck it IMHO, but other things like Wikipedia, using search engines, and things that are generally beneficial/educational should not ever be kept from the public in the name of profit. The problem is, without a completely neutral network it would take a large body of people to constantly sit there and judge what is and what is not acceptable to charge a premium for, so the obvious solution is to let the pipes fill as they will.

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say anymore. It's a complicated issue and I've made a poor analogy, but I can say that I am jaded when it comes to my perception of people all sitting around a television day in and day out instead of reading books, educating themselves, or just getting out in general and doing something positive for the world.

Thanks for the conversation though. I'm in a bit of a bad mood today and am just venting.

---

I don't know why anyone would downvote something like that. It's not like I am really ranting and swearing and being hateful. WTF is wrong with people? It's like once you get down into the depth of a thread people just turn into animals. Jeez. 




 With the right people and the right product, capitalism will provide wealth and jobs.

You know, I keep hearing that. We all do.

I find it morally abbhorent that one can sell life-saving apples at 1000% profit to people who have to save up between each other and split said apple with 10 other's just to get a little nutrition. That is what capitalism boils down to, or at least what it does in practice.

I'm not trying to compare these apples to Netflix, mainly because if nobody ever made another movie or mass produced another record again, you wouldn't catch me sweating it. People need to go outside more anyway. Maybe once petty entertainment is prohibitively expensive, or at least ridiculously difficult to really enjoy, people will start to wake up to the fact that they have been taking it in the ass the whole time; being sold shit they don't need at prices they can't afford. It's mind blowing how brainwashed the masses are, but what's even moreso is the fact that people seem to *know* how stupid they are acting yet seem to want to do nothing about it. It is at this point that I start to have less pity for that huge swath of the consumer entertainment market that will be truly affected by this.

I'm pretty sure techies will figure out how to get what they need done. That's just the nature of the beast here as much as lawyers in Congress get the shit they need done long before they go around pretending to care what voters think. 




 I have no idea. I googled for "net neutrality google channel" because I remembered this being posted a long time ago, and quite a few popped up. 




 It's open source software, and not the biggest project at that. Corporate dollars are not flowing into it because it's cheaper to use that source code w/o telling anyone than it is to do the right thing and actually support the project.

I don't know how *many* people care about PF, but I can tell you that in the course of my IT career I have seen some surprisingly large implementations of it at some surprisingly common household names. The list would probably really surprise a lot of people.

I personally love PF and wouldn't use anything else to secure an edge for a big network where budget and performance are big concerns. When I am asked what to use, I always point to it when appropriate, and reading this news really breaks my heart. I hope some philanthropist picks up where all these companies that use the software for free have shirked their moral responsiblity. 




 Definitely. Easy for them to produce, and you get some cool art in the process. Last time I bought a CD they sent me an OBSD lanyard and a puffer poster for free out of the blue.

OpenBSD is a wonderful operating system, and I've seen some *really* big implementations of PF not even bump a 0.2 on a load average at peak times. 




 If there is not already a law against that, there will be. Our legislative system is just a big game show to these crooks. "I'd like to buy another law, Pat!"

Capitalism is deeply flawed in this regard. Greed begets greed in this economy, and with every member of congress being spied on, as long as people out there have that kind of potential dirt on them, and as long as corruption in politics is not punished harshly, there is simply no impetus for our government to change a thing about any of this. This is business as usual, except you can't just demolish the Colloseum without expecting the lions to get hungry.

Should be very interesting to see how it plays out, although I think we all know where this is leading.

Edit: this is where it's going: http://imgur.com/AwSYTzK 




 Right, because burning dead soldiers is more* like knitting sweaters and petting kittens. 




 No joke. I always wondered why guys like him never ran for president until I realized just how smart they really might be - being cautious there because to me that level of intelligence is kind of unimagineable, kind of like their wealth. If I had that money I'd blow it all on a used naval destroyer (like you can buy one haha..) and do something stupid like try to invade North Korea and free some real slaves. 




 It's interesting when it's effective. Right now "the best country in the world" is drownging in the wake of greed, corruption, and breeding a generation of uneducated slaves that might one day find themselves being rescued from this place by human rights activists operating out of Zimbabwe or something. 




 ooo, this is nice. thanks! 




 That would piss the old man off bigtime. Can't wait to tell him that next time he drags that one out. Thanks haha... 




 Haha yeah you would really like him. He's a lot like you except he's funny and interesting and has had sex with a woman. 




 Seriously miss Winamp after moving to Linux. I wish XMMS had done better, and I *really* wish it had come with something like Winamps AVS. 




 You were expecting something different? I'm not holding my breath to read any headline like "World's richest people pool resources to rid the planet of starvation, disease, and pollution".

Like my dad says, you can wish in one hand and shit in the other - see which fills up faster.

I used to be all "YAAY SAVE THE WORLD :D", but now that I'm older it's more like "fuck, what the fuck just happened?" even though I know the answer to that question. 




 I thought this was an article from the Onion at a glance. My grandpa seriously walks to McDonalds and drinks coffee every morning with his ancient buddies, presumably to holla. 




 Given the technical details, yes, miles seems like a long ways, but I'd imagine an Internet-connected tranceiver next to the mark would be all that's needed to get the data across the globe. I'm fascinated too. 









 but I don't see how a tiny discreet chip could transmit over miles.

Go open up your cell phone and look at the circuit board in it. Now imagine if it didnt need to do anything BUT transmit 1's and 0's over long distances. The actual part that sends and recieves signal is just a few very tiny components. The rest is so you can play Angry Birds and look at Facebook. 




 Probably more like the Sinaloa and the feds are just building a monopoly. 




 GEEZ. If we only had a way to TEST the chemical. I can't wait until we invent science.

Anyone have a link to the MSDS? 




 At its finest? 




 Well this is good news. They shouldn't close the pass though. That's some awesome wade fishing back there. You can walk around in calf deep water barefoot for a long ways. Flounder and trout are everywhere in the flats, and bull reds running through that pass are consistently huge. 

If I owned that place I'd put a jetty and a grill on the water out there.

Yes, a lot of people didn't seem to give a shit about the place with their trash everywhere. Sad state of affairs. 




 I used to love going there, but the place was painful to look at. Completely unmaintained, huge rusted sheets of corrugated steel sticking up where the bulkheads used to be - I mean if you fell on one of these it could literally cut you in half. Not a place for small kids.

The place is out of the way, and as such the fishing there was generally pretty good. From there north to Sabine on that beach is just a toxic waste land after these storms.

So sad. Rollover used to be a yearly stop for me, would stay a few days, drink beer, cook out, and fish for everything the coast line has to offer. I have read that there was a restoration plan for the area, possibly relocating the pass or completely re-engineering the solution. There is just not enough of a tourist economy for the area because it is so remote and torn to pieces now to make financial sense to decision makers I guess. 




 anyone have a link to that pic posted a few years ago of the grackles all over the big bird sign at fiesta on 35? had a friend that lived near there and the noise was insane. there was literally a swath of bird shit 1/4 mile wide in the direction they took off regularly. 




 this is a big no-no. you install phone system, you configure 911 to dial 911. digit matching. it's easy and there are laws.

source: designed hundreds of them and *always* test 911, even if you have to route the call to your cell phone, testing that functionality before walking out the door is a must. 




 physics with.. marine biology? they'd send you to the bottom of the ocean with that kind of paperwork. they might even have you work on projects simulating what it would be like to land on Europa.

physics with.. geology? no - planetary geology! then, you could go to Europa too.

physics with.. mechanical/electrical engineering? you could build the space ship *and* fly it.

go for the gusto, i say.

fwiw, you are probably too smart to be a cop, btw. 
























 Good call. I caught this after the edit and might have suggested the same with the last word. 




 Ah, the essence of the appreciation for life: that which has yet to come. Bravo! 




 **How do you know if you are in love?**

I asked her how love,  
Appeared to her heart.  
Said she unto me,  
Most cheerfully,  
"One hates yet cannot part!" 




 This I can relate to. Well stated. 




 **True Cowardice**

How dare you scold! How dare you scoff!  
Now dare you take these shackles off. 




 **The Quiet One**

Corrosive memories and toxic relations,  
Plague one heart and mind.  
Fear of rejection and dark recollection,  
With an axe to grind.   




 **A Steel Wheel's Brakes Makes Sparks**

Lies haggardly wander,  
Tracks of tragedy.  
Drenched in regret,  
Soaked in agony,  
Let us not forget,  
What became of thee.
 




 **Never a Chance**

A mistaken cradle sways,  
In the summer breeze.  
An infant lies awake,  
Suffering wants and needs,  
Of mother's abandoned dreams.   




 Cake. What year and engine? Couple hours tops for oil and brakes. $90 all parts included. 




 Yeah, it's not what we need right now that's for sure. That's what makes it even worse for them. They are going to get the shit end of the frustration stick. 




 there is literally a ton of this sort of stuff on ebay that nobody is even bidding on. 




 Good. Then you know where I am coming from when I say that this is our country and the last people to intimidate us will be those who think *that* kind of wind is at their back. Let's face it.. Americans and especially Texans are literally armed to the teeth for a reason.This is the only country in the world where any all out ground assault is guaranteed to fail.

 




 It wasn't. That's why it's not around anymore.

Duh. 




 these families have all these kids they can not take care off, so they do not get the attention at home, so they go and join gangs

Then you probably understand perfectly well how legalizing abortion reduces crime. What do you care if those children had been born or not? Would you be willing to house troubled teenagers from broken families? One is probably passing by someone you know right now thinking about how to get money out of them.

Just curious. 




 [Sadly, your point is valid enough.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect#Donohue_and_Levitt_study) 




 Fuck that. Get up and go buy a gun. Doesn't have to be nice. Go to a pawn show and get a 12 gauge or an old .270. Hell, you can get a Mosin-Nagant for less than $100 these days, and the ammo for it is super cheap.

Take it apart and polish each piece on your kitchen table. Put it back together. Take it to the range.

Learn how to defend yourself, and *voila*, panic and fear are replaced with practicality and resolve. 




 theyre across town. i'll get some pics to you this week. thanks! 




 I will condition a couple of thick strips for you and put simple buckles in them for $17.50 each unless you need really long belts. That's as low as I can go.

What colors would you be interested in? I have most basic colors and a few browns. When we talk about color, please note that leather is a natural product with consistency and porosity variations between hides that will tend to send a dye's color in one direction or another.

I'm thinking one Mahogany and one tan? 




 Depends on what you want done on it. I can do a full basket weave, scrolling, and name stamp for $75. Takes all day to do something like that and the work is spread out over a few days for the finishing process.

Name stamp, scrolling, and dye for $45.

Just a name stamp and some dye will go for about $25.

If you can give me an idea of what you are looking for I can give you a better quote. Thanks! 




 Whoever designed that website needs to be given a citation. 




 Did you get my PM? 




 Used to and made enough to float me between jobs. Once I get some new gear made I'll bring the store back. 




 I sent a PM. Totally willing to make a collar. I'd make 7,0000 collars if I could sell them. 




 These are some of the belts: http://imgur.com/ywXXFTo

This is the kind of belt you want to wear when you go to court for beating up a bully: http://imgur.com/KKf1CDG

First thing I tooled in almost 20 years. Came out pretty good I think. Fits a small Beretta or PPK like a glove: http://imgur.com/05ziZnC

What work in progress looked like. I was pretty drunk when I made this one but in the end it came out beautiful and I wound up selling it for $100: http://imgur.com/qS4cD6z. Here is the finished product: http://imgur.com/53bB5BN.

Buddy had a 9.5" barrel on his 44 so I made this for him. He just wanted something slick and no frills. He gave me $200 for it and a few custom bullets for his Ruger: http://imgur.com/0TENoFb

Hunter's orange on the bullet rings for Simon's 7mm mag sleeve: https://m.imgur.com/CIKjnIS

My grandfather's pre-64 model 70 257 got a butt sleeve too: http://imgur.com/gDkN0Yb. Love that gun. You can build loads for varmints or for game as big as elk. I'm wrapping it in leather to preserve it. No oils from the leather touch the stock.

I wear this when I go hog hunting. It fits over my belt and perfectly on the opposite sides of my belt loops so it doesn't slip. Note the different loads for different purposes: http://imgur.com/2374vd7

I made this belt when I was 14. Real silver conchos. This was before I learned how to preserve leather. If you have buckles or conchos or things that you'd like embedded into the belt, let me know: http://imgur.com/baEHKO4

I'm not selling ammo here. I am selling the leather. The reason I'm exhibiting ammo is to imbue the artistry I put into my work. Buy a belt or a holster from me so I can eat. I'm 35 and unemployable. This is all I have and I'll put my heart into your leather. I get so many compliments on the finish and you can just tell by the feel that these things will last a lifetime. These pictures are a few years old and are only a fraction of what I managed to salvage. I inherited the tools from my grandfather and want to do right by him by making things that people will wear forever and never need to buy again.

 Del Rio and south of Hebbronville.

It was a shivering, clear December night, the stars visible through tendrils of smoke wafting out of an old, elevated deer blind at the intersection of two rutted roads. Old rifle brass lined the two by fours that framed the inside of our lookout, and we traded those stories into the wee hours of the morning, sipping from our flasks and enjoying the breezless night. The land owner sat next to me, obviously shaken as he recounted the time when the big pigs ravaged his campsite a few years ago. As I gaze down the moonlit path, a clean 800 yards to the top of the hill, the air is thick, freezing, and silent.

Then the path goes dark near the top of the hill. Not much of a silhouette to make out, just a dark area blotting out the entire width of the road way out there, too far to see with the naked eye at night. My 9x scope on my 22-250 was built to pick off javelina the next day, as were the Barnes TSX Varmint Grenades built into the tips, but my buddy had a 14x on his 30-06. 

All this passed through my head as I said, "Give me the gun", interrupting his story. 

I painted the road with the cross hairs at the top of the hill, and I what I saw blew my mind. It gives me chills just writing this. This pig's nose was on one side of the road and it's tail was on the other, but it was at least a 650 yard shot. A factory load at this distance would have to hit a pig that size clean through the eyes to knock him down. No wind, but I'd never shot this gun before and wasn't sure how it was sighted. I ran a few clicks on the elevation and took a deep breath, letting it half way out as my finger grew tighter on what was undoubtedly a hair trigger, adjusting the height of the cross hairs ever-so-slightly with what I knew about how to distance a shot.

Then it was gone. Poof into the 10' high dry, thorny scrub that only South Texas can produce, scrub only a hog of massive proportions could create a game trail in.

"It's gone!", I had missed my opportunity. But then, just as I said that and handed back the gun, another blob popped up a little further down the road.

This one was even bigger. I stared down my 9x and my buddy drew a mark with the 14x, but before he could muster the breath to steady his aim, this giant animal too was gone like a ghost. Then another one darted across the road, followed by a few smaller ones that looked pretty damned big themselves.

I might never know how much those hogs weighed that could block an entire lane of traffic, but I'll tell you one thing. The sound that guy made when he was describing them made me shit my pants a little, and by the time the sun came up that morning I was a believer.

Now I don't mind people getting on me about smoking in a deer blind. We were up high, the smoke was going straight up, and we weren't there to knock out big bucks. We were there to have an excuse to get drunk and bullshit with each other for hours on end without our wives telling us to come inside. All things considered, if smoking in a deer blind keeps hogs that big at 650 yards, I'm keeping a carton in the next one.

Laugh now, but if I could show you the 4x4 at the campsite gate that got chomped nearly clean in half, you'd be smoking too. It might actually increase the life expectancy of a big game hog hunter.

Also helped justify the cost of buying a 44 magnum and working up Ruger-only loads for it. I've owned that magnum since about a week after this hunting trip. If you want a 44 magnum show your wife some pictures of a giant hog and tell her they live where you hunt. She might even buy you one for your birthday. If she buys you a 380 after showing her the big hogs, well, you might want to revisit your marriage vows.

 That guy was probably from California. Don't feel bad about taking it easy on him.

hah!

FFS... You know what I really don't like about this town?

NOBODY CAN TAKE A FUCKING JOKE!

Get outta town.. haha... 




 This is gonna get buried but it also feels good to get it off my chest.

A few years ago a friend of a friend was in dire straights and needed a place to stay for a few nights. He was a computer guy like me so we had some things to talk about. He seemed like an OK guy, well ok not really but I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

Long story short the guy tries to get money out of me at midnight to go score crack so I have to eventually throw him out of my house at gunpoint and six months later I find out I got a warrant for my arrest because he told the cops he was me when he got arrested for a PI. They bought it even though his physical description is similar to mine in only that we are both considered caucasian.

Meanwhile during that six months I had been turned down for job after job, only to find out that I had this friggin warrant out for my arrest without any of these people bothering to tell me.

Never pressed charges on the poor bastard, and I probably could have SUED TRAVIS COUNTY AGAIN, but I did have to spend a lot of time and money getting the record expunged. Idiot cops didn't care about shit except getting another warm ass behind cold bars. That's all that matters.

Look out for number one, I say. 




 Austin... Austin... Austin.

Where does one begin?

I saw you when I was little, from the campus down Guadalupe,  
While my dad mastered computers, I learned to play pool at the union.  
Ben White was four lanes wide, you could skate across without a care,  
And there were cotton fields on I-35, between downtown and Pflugerville.  

Movies 12 was the place to go, to sit in their big, fancy seats.  
The Magic Time Machine's food was as good as The Broken Spoke's eats.  
It was fun to shoot my BB gun at cans under the Onion Creek Bridge.  
It was fun to do a lot of things in Austin when I was a kid...

Times they are a'changing, at least that's what my dad tells everyone,  
And anyone who will listen about the way things used to go about being done.  
There's even less good taste than there is common decency, he'd go on to tell you about,  
I guess I feel in today's day and age, there's no telling how things will turn out.  

Now the drag is dangerous, no matter who you are, or what time of day you go,  
And the school I used to dream of attending, flew out of reach years ago.  
The blistering interstate and buzzing city streets are packed 24 hours a day,  
With patrons of the overpriced sprawl running the entire length of the 35 Highway.  

The movies just suck now, ok that's not really Austin's fault..  
But the food here is hit or miss no matter where you dine a lot.   
My neighbors shot my kids' dog with their CO2 powered gun,  
And I am the bad guy for kicking these assholes out of town?  

This place is turning out like Los Angeles right in front of our eyes,  
And the lakes and rivers of the Central Texas region are all gonna run dry.  
Plastic bags are banned and recycling is in, everything is awesome and fantastic,  
Like the American dream that used to be part of this scene... it's all just made of plastic.

This place's culture, it's character, it's value, become more apparent as we grow older.  
It's definitely unique, but it's still part one thing, and it's beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  
When a town like this can lose it's appeal to the very people born and bred to revere it,  
It's a sign of the times that the rest of the country has long gone to hell in a handbasket.  

Austin, Texas is the home of a *very* prominent state government body that will continue to push the line between human rights and corporate interests to the limits, but if any single city in the entire country has the power to change all of that, it's Austin. For every jackass that arrives from another state who does not have a clue what Texas hospitality is really about.. FROM TEXAS OR NOT.. it's like having two good people leave. Just look at the fucking roads, people.. if people don't start understanding that IT'S OKAY TO BITCH about all these things, for the sheer fact that it makes other people feel OKAY about not being perfectly fucking happy in the great city of Austin Texas Music Capital of the World or whatever... people seem so reserved in their true opinions of this place and I like this thread.

TLDR: The problem is ______ people. 




 Now we know where all the interesting people live :D 









 Then the western end of the Davis Mountains is what you are looking for, maybe around Valentine. The further you get towards the mountains the more likely you are to see some gigantic elk. Mule deer out there are enormous too, pronghorn, pigs but not like south Texas, but you won't find anything without water. Land with water near it or near the surface still costs quite a bit out there, but if you look long enough I'm sure you'll find something.

I feel like I am talking to myself here. This is the kind of thing I'd like to do eventually. I grew up in Culberson county and for some crazy reason all I want is to go back out there to.. nothing...

Good luck. Would be cool if you came back and showed us some pictures. I'd strongly suggest looking up hydrology reports for the region. There are huge fault lines out there that make for deep water wells one one side of them and very shallow wells on the other.

I understand that Kent, Texas has about the cleanest well water you can find. An old timer they took samples for 11 PPM foreign particle out of one of the wells there long ago. 




 I only got an update to 8.0, but PTWC has it at 8.2 here:

EVALUATION

 SEA LEVEL READINGS INDICATE A TSUNAMI WAS GENERATED. IT MAY HAVE
 BEEN DESTRUCTIVE ALONG COASTS NEAR THE EARTHQUAKE EPICENTER AND
 COULD ALSO BE A THREAT TO MORE DISTANT COASTS. AUTHORITIES SHOULD
 TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS POSSIBILITY. THIS
 CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR SEA LEVEL DATA TO DETERMINE THE
 EXTENT AND SEVERITY OF THE THREAT.

 FOR ALL AREAS - WHEN NO MAJOR WAVES ARE OBSERVED FOR TWO HOURS
 AFTER THE ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL OR DAMAGING WAVES HAVE NOT
 OCCURRED FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS THEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES CAN ASSUME
 THE THREAT IS PASSED. DANGER TO BOATS AND COASTAL STRUCTURES CAN
 CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL HOURS DUE TO RAPID CURRENTS. AS LOCAL
 CONDITIONS CAN CAUSE A WIDE VARIATION IN TSUNAMI WAVE ACTION THE
 ALL CLEAR DETERMINATION MUST BE MADE BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

ESTIMATED INITIAL TSUNAMI WAVE ARRIVAL TIMES AT FORECAST POINTS
WITHIN THE WARNING AND WATCH AREAS ARE GIVEN BELOW. ACTUAL
ARRIVAL TIMES MAY DIFFER AND THE INITIAL WAVE MAY NOT BE THE
LARGEST. A TSUNAMI IS A SERIES OF WAVES AND THE TIME BETWEEN
SUCCESSIVE WAVES CAN BE FIVE MINUTES TO ONE HOUR.

 Texas Dept. of Emergency Management was at the north Packery jetty Friday looking for it about 9 AM. I kept my eye out for oil or tar all weekend but didn't find any as of Sunday night near Packery. This moved in very quickly. 




 For the impatient:

http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/search/index?utf8=%E2%9C%93keywords=texas 




 West Texas has some of the cheapest land in the country. There's no water anywhere, no utilities for miles and miles, forget shade, and probably no mineral rights. I've heard of land near Van Horn still going for a few bucks an acre in big chunks. 

Curious as to why someone would post this question here. Can I be nosy and ask what you are doing? 




 If I had it to do all over again I would look past my initial interest in computers, where I work now, and I would have gone for the gusto by majoring in marine biology and geology, and only minoring in computer science. My passions are for fishing and rock hunting. I would be much happier if I were getting paid to be stationed on a research vessel in the Gulf or some remote research base rather than sit behind a computer all day only to design more of them.

But I am lucky in that I hate my job only because it is unfulfilling. I think most people who read your question would like to talk about their manager more than the fact that they want to change the world for the better, which I believe most people do.

I could switch jobs, but I'd still be working on computers if I expected to make great money. I could go back to swinging a wrench or a hammer, but then I'd be working my fingers to the bone trying to make ends meet.

What took me a while to figure out was the fact that computers are just a tool, like wrenches are tools. I liked computers a lot, and I like wrenches too, but I like camping and fishing a whole lot more.

Develop your passions and honor the experiences that sparked them because those desires only strengthen with time. Get out there and get paid to use your heart instead of your hands. Just remember that for the next 10 or 20 years that you are not just developing valuable skills, but that you are also cultivating happiness, something that money can't buy. 

 




 Most people in AA meetings, at least in Austin, are there because they have a DWI and it's part of their sentence.

In other news, you can get *sentenced* to AA, not only by a bottle, but by a judge.

This makes it punitive. If you've ever forced to sit through AA meetings with a bible-thumping, crack-smoking sponsor, you'll know how much of a joke it is for some people. While there are benefits to be derived from such a thing for others, the same could be said about driving out into the middle of nowhere and stranding yourself just so you can take two weeks to walk back. 

At least by the time you got back you'd have had a lot of time truly to yourself to think about the rest of your life. 




 I don't know how something from the 3-D plane could even be observed in 2-D. To say that a 2-D would see layers of the human body implies *some* thickness (that is, a value only measurable using a 3-D spatial vector) to be maintained in order for light to pass through it to make it visible.

In order to observe a 4-D entity in 3-D, I think space and time would have to cease to exist as we know it first since in the 4th time might be considered a spatial vector to be moved about upon rather than in one direction. To this end, a "being", if you will, capable of existing in the 4th dimension, would be able to go back and forth in time at will in order to find something. In order for that to happen, the medium in which this being exists must be ever-present, much as the ground we walk on is.

To observe a 4th dimension entity from within the 3rd would require applying 4th dimension physics to the 3rd, thus the possibility of leaving everything in the universe in all possible states in a single existence.

What I guess I'm thinking is that you'd at some point have to break the laws of physics for a given dimension in order to observe an entity from a higher dimension, and without any education whatsoever to back this up, it doesn't seem like you can break just one law of physics, if any can be broken at all. It seems like it's an all-or-nothing deal. You either get one D or another D, but never two of them at the same time.

But then, the 3rd dimension is simply a set of instructions for creating the 4th, which leads me to another question.. how can the 4th dimension exist at all (in the sense that it includes all of time as well) if time has not yet ended?

This sounds like the 4th dimension is *being* built, our perception of that process is our existence in the 3rd, and the 4th cannot ever be observed until *all* of time has past in the universe. It would then stand to reason that no 3-D could be observed from the 2nd without the entirety of the 2nd (space) being present at that instance.

This is all, of course, if you are subscribing to the notion that the 4th dimension utilizes what we percieve as time as a spatial vector, in which case it's a little easier to picture the 4th dimension as any one of infinite alternative universes that exist in parallel to our own. Multidimensional arrays in a given programing language seem to reflect/relate this concept rather well. The 4th dimension is just like the 3rd, except to find something you also have know *which* instance of the univese to look in, not just the place and time. As with the 2nd, in order to find something on must know the X, the Y, and the time to look at X and Y for it. 

Now it just sounds like the 4th dimension is just a collection of 3-D universes and all of the time measurable within them... except in the 4th, one can travel back in time, playing the interaction of mass and energy in reverse, thus eventually creating a huge ball of mass/energy that would eventually implode under it's own weight, perhaps similar in appearance to the way a star does, into whatever instance of existence the big bang itself emerged from. If one were so inclined.

"Hey dad can me and Jimmy go play in the Big Bang?"

"No, son. Remember what happened last time. You went too far back in time and created that universe with humans in it. They almost escaped."

"Aww! But dad! We sent them back!"

"Yes, and I know what else you did to them while you were handling them. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Now go play in the future, and be sure to bring me back a newspaper. I need to know exactly how much it's going to rain next month."

Ugh. I am *not* normal :( 




 A sustainable but humble place in the foothills of the Rockies so my son doesn't have to grow up in town. Would be nice to have a nice creek to fish, some mountainsides to explore, lots of trees. I'd use what's left over to build a big garage used to develop cost efficient methods of replacing combustion engines in vehicles with electric motors and batteries. Enough solar panels to keep a few charged. I'd customize the interior of large luxury vehicles with touchscreen displays, satellite and cell-based Internet access, vehicle system diagnostic displays, maybe even a doppler unit.

Then I'd be in business, armed with a ton of patents, and headed to town to open up shop. 




 I don't see why people stop at these places. The place is everything one could ever hate about consumerism. It's like going on a road trip to Walmart on Black Friday.They are overcrowded, and the prices are through the roof. Gas is at least $0.25 higher than the last town you left, the food they sell tastes like it has enough sodium in it to catch a swimming pool on fire, and most of the help are seasonal, back-woods Texas education system casualties that wouldn't know what to do without the calculator on the cash register.

When I think of this place, I hear the radio as I am driving down I-10 from Houston to San Antonio, and my peaceful thoughts are interrupted by a speeding vehicle past, and I can almost make out the incessant repetition of the word "Buccees! :D" from the cacophony as I swerve out of their way.

I picture an obnoxious family precariously tumbling out of an older gas guzzler with Alabama plates and Sarah Palin's election stickers on the back glass. As dad waits in line to fill up for 20 minutes, the collective stupidity of the troop can be felt from inside the store by innocent people just needing to replace a fuse, patch a tire, or take a shit in peace. Patrons flee the path of the stampede as it migrates towards the double doors, eyes bulging in different directions, with sparsely toothed mouths agape in awe of that stupid sign. Extremities flailing towards a door that should be pulled open, they are perhaps by now drooling enough to be spitting as they communicate with each other in a language only that family knows. They make more than a bee-line to the kiosks and occupy those available for a full 10 minutes, trying desperately to order extra chili and cheese on their hot dogs in salacious and monosyllabic debate.

The ordering kiosks are in ruins, and the smartest employee in the store is frantically trying to reset them so the 30 other people now waiting in line can get their nitrate fix on. The troop has dispersed throughout the store, barreling to and from the salt-and-sugar aisles, bumping into people and displays and knocking items off the end caps, forcing their way through the narrow aisles. It is more than one hapless employee's job to follow this escaped side show around the store with a mop.

Their order numbers are called one by one, and one by one they rush back across the store, arms loaded with absolutely nothing of true value or nutrition, hemorrhaging saran-wrapped fudge brownies and heavy metal bearing key chains from China that read "Welcome to Texas" for them to take turns chewing on. The pick up line is total chaos. As they argue with each other and complain to the help about who ordered what and the lack or excess of various condiments and toppings, somewhere down that highway a steer drops dead from dehydration, his emaciated carcass already being consumed by vermin before it even hits the ground.

The End. 




 There is no biological basis for race.

Then why arent caucasian children spontaneously born to mongoloid families?

I think you need to quit drinking your own bath water. 




 It's just an example. Chill out. He could have just as easily used any of the other millions of things police use to profile people that someone else would have taken issue with. Why not use race? It's a prime example of what cops use to fuck with people. 




 They are better off finding work elsewhere anyway. With their hours being slashed to deprive people of what is commonly being referred to as a human right, it's only a matter of time before they resort to worse tactics to pad their bottom line.. like colluding to further derail a minimum wage hike. 




 I think it's pretty well established that people don't give a shit enough about the planet to take their reusable bags to HEB on their own. If that were the case we would have figured out how to avoid this pile of garbage back in the beginning of the industrial revolution. Logic dictates that laws must be made to - wait for it - protect the planet from people!

What a concept. When I read about people like this I have to wonder what else they do for kickbacks. 




 Here we are trying to clean up the place while some politician responsible for less voters than the mayor of Waco needs to make noise in order to get re-elected, so he picks some progressive statue like the low hanging fruit that it is. 




 I am all for testing chemicals on the animals in Congress. 




 They could also build a solar panel farm [instead of Spain](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2424/3879608564_0eb3189ef3.jpg) to solve this little crisis.

How much would it cost to cover Culberson county in Texas with solar panels? Probably a lot less than drilling or chopping down the Siberian forests ever will.

 




 *This*, my friends, is why we can't have nice things:

The stuff you make plastic from is not the same stuff your car drives on

People wonder why I drink.  
























 I hate to tell you this but you really look stupid to everyone reading this. You obviously have no valid experience with the subject matter at hand from which to draw any realistic conclusions.

Everyone here knows that driving while intoxicated is a crime, and they know why, and that it's punished harshly for a good reason.

What you fail to realize is that this is a cash grabbing stunt that every law enforcement office in the country just can't wait to get their hands on.

In that sense, you are personally insulting everyone who views this thread that understands the ramifications of your type of ignorance: that you'd vote for people who favor unjust laws of this nature.

It's just what's happening. Try not to take it too personally. Your feathers are showing. Instead, I might suggest, if you are in fact here because you don't know what you are talking about and you are not just trolling for a fight, that you address the concerns others raised in direct opposition to your first comment in this thread rather than picking and choosing those arguments that you feel you found a flaw with. Your own argument's basis in reality is flawed in this regard, and it's blatantly obvious because you simply refuse to address the real concerns behind this entire issue and instead choose to pursue some personal agenda.

Perhaps you are a victim of an intoxicated driver/person or know someone who was, but I can tell one thing is for certain: you've never had an unjust DWI or DUI (about half get dismissed in Travis County here in Texas alone). I can tell not because you are so righteous (your petty arguments are very laughable and easily deconstructed by even the most primitive of debate tactics), it is because your lack experience with "the system" *as a whole* really shows. 




 The problem with googling how to do that is you are just getting a list of instructions.

Actually thinking up this sort of idea and implementing it by reading software manuals and knowing what you are looking at in terms of communications protocols is an entirely different thing.

If you really mean what you said, I would offer you a little advice: read one manual page a day. In just one year you'll know more, or at least have been exposed to more than 90% of "sysadmins" out there. 




 Install Linux on your wireless router and pipe the raw output of tcpdump on the various vlans/interfaces through ssh back into instances of etherape displaying the activity using remote X authority.

Bonus: understand all that shit and you might land a job doing it. 

Disclaimer: may also get you fired. 




 So then it's more like playing golf..

"Don't move.... don't move.... WHACK!!!"

No. I still don't get it do I? 




 Imagine playing cricket with a two ton ball of horns and hooves flying at you with the force of a cement truck, and trying to stop it with with a firecracker and a fishing weight. 




 "God, I hate this job" I muttered to myself.

Handing out bags of blood and skeletal remains all day can take a toll on a soul.

"Stay in school" said the voice in my head.

Or was it the bright-eyed customer with wings speaking to me through the cross hung around my neck?

I may never know, but I can tell you one thing: life in the ghetto is a drag. All you need is one puff to know that. A real shame, this chance we waste. 




 Bust out the popcorn hahaha.... 




 Okay, who's brother owns the drug testing company this time? 




 Would definitely be high on my "Shit To Do" list as governor of this state about now. 




 No shit. That thing shows up in Port A it's toast. There will be a thousand people out there trying to eat it. 




 Thanks for the heads up.

By the way, I just saved $100 on Sharknado insurance. Disclaimer: I live inland for a reason. 




 It would make more sense for the Mexican government to get their own shit together.

What do I know though? I have only grown up watching the US thoroughly bungle op after op for decades. Maybe they are right on this one. What could go wrong? 




 You work in IT long enough this is bound to happen. I've trained one myself, but knew it was coming. I designed and built the system, got this guy on and trained him to support it at a much lower rate, and I moved on to building another system.

This is just the way things are.

But there are new systems being built every day, and most companies in the US just can't assume an H1B workforce right off the bat. Someone local has to design them, put them together, act as vendor liaison, make the hiring recommendations, and all that fun stuff. It'll work out.

Right? 




 ok ok i did it. anyone got a problem with... odessa better speak up.


hah... 




 Venting is good. It lets people know that they are not the only ones who feel this way.


Speaking of which, I took a GIS course at Del Mar College and spent all my time dumping any data I could find for the Nueces county area into ARCView. I had a gigantic dataset to work with at the end of the semester with hundreds of layers and options.

What I found out was that you do not want to live in Corpus long, and you really don't want to have kids there. The reasons are not just economic or social, but environmental. The place is straight up toxic and all told certain parts of the city should be superfund sites.

It's been over 10 years since I did this research. I was inspired by someone who taught school in Corpus that found less that 200 PPM life in the Nueces river watershed after uranium tailings started getting dumped into the river system. He said each drop of water from the river should be teeming with life when in fact it was barren, and the microscopic organisms he studied were mutated and unrecognizable.

Granted that's a little hearsay for you, but it's what I was told by someone I trust very much.

I was pretty much blacklisted from the school after putting together "the map". I just wanted to find out what neighborhoods were best, but I wound up learning that Corpus has one of the highest birth defect rates in the country, among a ton of other unsettling things.

[Of course, Nueces county having 84% more birth defects than any other in Texas could all be chalked up to "chance".](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:utsXQj_hfLYJ:www.caller.com/news/2008/jan/25/birth-defects-84-percent-higher-nueces-co")

I would get the fuck out of there if I were you. There is a reason the population of that city has not undergone a significant increase in decades. You can't save that city from those refineries and well meaning efforts like yours are probably better spent elsewhere in a place where your ideology has a head start. Living there in willful ignorance is what people are doing. 

I can see you wanting to pretty the place up, but you are polishing a turd in doing so. Of course Corpus has great potential. What coastal city does not? The problem is that the place is just a dump and the majority of voters there are literally too stupid to do anything about it. There is really no way to clean that place up and that is why thousands and thousands of high school and college graduates and dropouts alike have just *left*. 




 It occurred to me that this kind of thing would shake up this market in some sense.

As someone who has worked in the field for years, I'd have to argue about maintaining copper (at least coax) vs. running fiber costs.

The copper is already there. We are looking at easements, the little battery boxes here and there, the hubs, and headends. With fiber the logistics of running new line all over town are practically insurmountable without the overt support and assistance of often multiple municipalities for a given run.

Fiber requires expensive equipment to be placed every so often, equipment that needs space.. zoning. Power, backup, high availability, etc. are all huge factors that coax systems just don't really have to deal with at a comparable cost for the sheer fact that the infrastructure for such services is already allotted and often oversubscribed in and of themselves.

Moreover, the equipment that delivers this fiber service from the curb to the home is basically your run of the mill Alcatel-Lucent fiber to copper switch. Multi-gig links across single mode fiber multiplexing the dozens of 10/100/1000 ethernet links to people's homes all terminating into carefully calculated port density located inside of water tight and up-to-date regulation adhering boxes every few hundred feet.

Unless of course they are delivering fiber to the curb, which they are most often not. FIOS is a bit of a different story, as is my understanding. Verizon often runs fiber straight into a box on the side of a house, peeling off a wavelength from the fiber trunks following power lines.

Having painted this picture, the zoning and logistics of getting this MUX and media conversion in place is really what the problem is all about for companies like ATT. In more than a few markets, particularly on the west coast, this has been a complete disaster for them. U-Verse, Lightspeed.. whatever you want to call it all came from projects similar to Google's later fiber initiative. The difference is that ATT really suffered when breaking this over-building ground while their successors in the industry were able to benefit from ATT's blundering lessons, such as "don't try this in California's mega-metropolitan areas without balls of steel and abyssal pockets.

Now here we site, more along the lines of your second paragraph. Doing this on a scale that would actually effect change in people's ability to communicate would seriously fuck the status quo, no matter how you spin it.

Thanks for the financial insight. As a grunt and engineer I see it from one perspective and have intentionally ignored the numbers aspect, which is probably where my question really came from. 




 Both. 




 I wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that building out fiber to everyone's curb is prohibitively expensive, and the act of doing so would trigger cable companies to "flip the switch" on DOCSIS3.  




 If this information is true about her being denied medication, and depending on the nasty stuff they had her on, it's easy to believe that she could have gone into some kind of withdrawal-related shock.

I bet she had a seizure after 48 hours of no SSRIs and died from complications related to her not having her blood pressure medication.

It's going to be something convoluted like that. I say that - I doubt the official story will tell us anything too incriminating about the PD, but if there is any merit to the story about her not having access to these particular types of medication you can bet she suffered horribly for it, especially if she were on high-doses.

Sure, it's all speculation at this point, but I've seen people in jail go through withdrawals from these types of meds, and it's not pretty. Here in Austin, one of the questions you are asked is if you are on benzodiazepenes. Another is how often you drink. If you tell them you eat 100 MG of Xanax a day and/or a bottle of Wild Turkey with your dinner, they are going to have to accommodate you or you will drop dead in a couple days if that. 




 He is just doing what he got voted into office to do. This is what republicans want, and they are getting it. Good for them. I wish every other political party out there was as true to their word as this guy.  




 give her a gigantic hug

Thanks for this. I used to hear this all the time at places like the grocery store, the beach, parties, and pretty much wherever I ran into people who she taught. It was great to read this in this context. Made me feel like she was still teaching, still part of that community.

Mom is still here but not for long. I will give her a hug from Reddit.

I never thought I'd be saying those words. Look at the big, hard man right now... 




 Single mom. Feel better now?

You probably shouldn't talk about my father.

One does not necessarily have to **pay** for someone else's lunch for them to be able to eat, but it helps

There's a proverb out there about teaching and fish. I'll let you figure it out. 




 My mother was a teacher. She spent her paychecks and entire teaching career helping students in need by making sure they had a ride to school, tooth brushes, deodorant, **lunch**, school supplies... basic things that some parents simply did not provide. She would even rescue animals, particularly strays she found around the campus, take them home, doctor them up, and find homes for them.

And she got ran out of a school district for it.

Let me tell you something about this. I watched her suffer for the lack of empathy that everyone else had for children, animals, and life in general. I watched how that school district sucked the life out of her and ostracized her for having a heart. Her kids did so much better on tests and in life in general that it made the other teachers look bad. It made the establishment look bad. The low bar held by the school district was being raised by her behavior, and few of the other teachers could keep up. She showed kids more than how to use a comma. She showed them love - especially the kids who had none at home.

I am filled with rage for what happened to her. I have no pity whatsoever for school administrators who get sacked for corruption and incompetence, and if it weren't for the sweet-natured woman who raised me I too would have grown up absolutely bitter about it in a less than civilized way. I take a very critical eye to my child's education, and you better believe I will not tolerate anything less than the things my mother brought to class for her kids.

Raise the bar. If we don't, another country will. Other countries **are**. We will have no way of competing on a globally growing scale in just another generation or so without the kind of dedication and charisma brought to the table by the most special and influential of people in our children's lives.

I don't care what anyone says. When you see her mailbox around Christmas explode with cards from kids she taught 10 years prior, you see what I mean when I say education lost one hell of an icon when she was run out of town years ago.

My mother would have paid for this child's lunch, and she would have gotten to the bottom of why they were short their lunch money.

Edit: Commas. 




 I'll never visit New Braunfels or San Antonio's parks again because of the crowds, but seeing this in Corpus will have me go out of my way to get some RR at the water park with the family - and I can get out and catch me some reds.

This is a great idea. It will bring money into the Corpus economy, provide a few jobs, and put some of those roads to use. I hope it attracts enough business to stay afloat. 

---

The only problem is that this waterpark is on the Island. That's quite a drive, and during spring break season that causeway is going to be gridlocked for a solid month. Traffic on that little old highway 361 is already pretty bad most of the season, with the speed limit never going above 60 and the road only being two lanes (and cops everywhere..).

So here we go with the traffic jams. Corpus can't win for losing. 




 Thanks for the tip!  




 Are you hiring bulldozer drivers?

My career has been focused on UNIX systems and Cisco network engineering. Big firewalls, giant NAC implementations, customized authentication mechanisms and turnkey VPN solutions, among a bunch of other non-AD and Exchange/IIS administration stuff.

I am not a Windows guy. Never have been, and that's what really bums me out about Corpus. Unless I can find a job doing simple Cisco network engineering, or working for an ISP, I'll be lucky to even land a seat at CSC for some Hazmat training this August. 




 Generally speaking about %15 but no less than $2 on a plate of food.

That's my policy. I don't use a calculator for this.. round it up. Spend your time enjoying the place, not squabbling over pennies. I've actually had to encourage people to do this before, so there you go. 




 I second this if only for the fact that even if you lived exactly half-way between Katy and Austin, her commute would still take much longer because highway 71 coming into Austin at all hours of the day is TERRIBLE. Highway 290 has 50 traffic lights between Brenham and any given spot in town, and they are only putting up more every day.

Have you considered road construction between here and there? Probably wouldn't hurt to check out what's coming up. It could really be a deal breaker.

You got the good end of this stick, and believe me, the other end doesn't smell good.

This all sounds good on paper to you now, but two months of this commute and you'll be at each other's throats. Besides, for what you'd save in gas by working/living locally you'd have enough to rent a decent place for each of you.

Putting miles like that, especially during the summer, on your vehicles is really going to take it's toll in a few months time.

I could literally sit here all night and think of reasons why this is not the best of ideas. Noble, I'll give you that, but realistic is not a word I'd use to describe this scenario.

If you both have jobs *now* you have a better chance of getting a job in either city. At the risk of sounding presumptuous (I'm given little to work with), I'd have to say the way I would handle this situation is to get a place outside of Katy for the time being, get her set up in a temporary place in Austin, and have her *immediately* start looking for work in Houston.

Either way she's gonna hate Texas traffic with a passion soon enough. 

I mean honestly the sick part of me kind of laughs at the thought.. it just doesn't make sense man. That's coming from a cynic who has suffered 25 years of commuting to and from all over Texas; from the bitter country boy who watched traffic, overpopulation and the resulting sprawl obliterate the countryside over the last 45. If you are looking to get reasons to avoid traffic from someone and tips on how to do so, that I can provide, but I have a hard time justifying anything that doesn't involve minimizing time on the road.

The humanitarian in me is what made me offer these words in good faith. 




 "If only they could"

My heart weeps, let me tell you.

Put an axe in it. 




 Daybreak's beams cast their grip up and over the Organ Mountains, combing the fine sands of the plains below. Red irises and slit pupils glint dutifully as the ancient white sands of a place once called "New Mexico" became illuminated by an alien spectrum of UV light that only a planet with very little atmosphere could entertain. 

As *the collective* proceeds, cyanotic scales glimmered more and more sharply as familiarly proportioned yet immense figures arise in droves from the dizzying depths of an obsidian staircase upward into the most prophetically inhospitable climate ever suffered by any form of self-consciousness born of this now barren planet.

And to *the collective* is offered an intensifying electric-blue glow and a sizzling expanse of a horizon interrupted only by heat dissipating from the occasional and fleeting mirage. The blindingly raw spectrum of first light that once primitively triggered a series of biological reactions has been usurped with a  circadian rhythm autonomously independent of external stimuli and redesigned by the forces of nature to bend to the will of these sole surviving witnesses of time, *the collective*.

A first set of eyelids shutter out the sterilizing radiation and unrelenting abrasiveness of finely ground glass. A glass so pervasive and mercilessly cast by unimpeded winds that long ago scoured was the once living terrain of color, and now only the most persistent of jagged rock spires stand in mere skeletal ruins of what were once the most massive geological features on the face of this rock we made our home. The surface of a world once covered in mountains as high as oceans deep now floats through space as a cemetery where no epitaph could survive the elemental barrage, where no dates could represent time itself in any meaningful way, where the concept of life and death lost polarization long before the mountains dissolved and seas boiled away.

The wind picks up as an isobar passes over the region, and the very ground begins to vibrate as the chanting masses synchronize the indescribably minute details of their planetary domain with their self-conceived and self-achieved biological limit of intelligence, a form of sentient life that was once only fanciful belief of even the greatest minds our own grandchildren will not even have heard of in their time.

As quickly as the sand was stirred by the shuffling of reverent footsteps the ritual is complete. *The collective* files back through the immense labyrinth of volcanic corridors and caverns that have for eons sculpted and to perfection the last living vessels of human DNA the Earth will ever see. The labyrinth created by the very beings spawned from it's protective depths, once a raging inferno tempered ultimately to provide a utopian existence for a civilization who manifested the ability to not only bring forth from fire and brimstone the soft and subtle cravings of the flesh, but to eliminate the effects that only a craving animal can bring to it's own doorstep.

What little is still known of their lineage is only a minor mystery. While the bones and buildings and accomplishments of ancient times have long since been returned to elementary form, they are no longer needed by a race of beings capable of willfully modifying their own genetic expression to thrive under conditions which we mere prototypes could not have even imagined a hand in bringing upon ourselves.

Their knowledge is the absolute truth about the meaning of knowledge itself: Life will find a way, and without life there is no way to be found.
 




 You couldn't get me on 71 towards dripping springs around dinner time if the meal were free. 




 Okay. $2 a foot. Deal?

I'm kidding. Let me ask about it and I'll get back with you. Would it be possible to see some pictures of the place? 




 That's the total estimate based on what you've said, assuming we aren't spending it all on paints and what not. Would like to take a look to see how fair that is and go from there. 




 $1.00 per foot, primed and painted, he said.

 




 This is the double standard by which our government operates, and with it being in the face of everyone who watches television/has a phone/uses the internet in general, maybe it will finally get some attention. 




 Unfortunately might makes right in this country. The process you are speaking of is the perversion of our government that has been going on for decades if not centuries to at least some extent.

It's just the way things get done around here and as our working generation has been taught no amount of voting is going to change things.  




 I brought this up with my carpenter and am awaiting a response. We just finished remodeling the interior of a house and our customer is thoroughly impressed with especially the interior. His baseboards and molding are flawlessly cut and painted.

How many rooms? 




 I slept on this and took down the original response in an effort to clarify my stance, our abilities, and intentions. Thank you for your time.

I'd highly recommend that anyone looking to use a service like this pay absolutely little to nothing until the work is substantially complete to your satisfaction or use a escrow or something.

* Payment comes after the job is complete or as work progresses satisfactorily, depending on the size and nature of the job. 
* We are not really looking for large jobs unless it is something we are 110% sure we can complete.

Classic case with a lot of small "contractors" is they take the money, have no clue what they are doing, bankrupt, and the customers are left with nothing. 

* I have been victimized by such "small contractors" and would not wish that on anyone.
* We would require some money for initial materials depending on the job. This is only fair.
* Then again, this is totally dependent on the nature and size of the job.
* We are far from clueless. Meet the crew:

**The Carpenter**

Our *real* [Journeyman Carpenter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentry#Apprenticeships_and_Journeymen_carpenters) has been swinging a hammer his entire life. He is stout and limber and can use up a stack of plywood faster than anyone I've seen. He is also excellent with automobiles and generally speaking is a wizard with woodwork.


**The Mechanic**

Our mechanic has been working on vehicles for 40 years, the veritable and venerable equivalent of mastery. Ask him a question about a vehicle... He has also performed his share of carpentry and electrical wiring in homes and buildings. I have been pushing him to become [ASE Certified](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Service_Excellence), which he could do in a heartbeat if I could talk him into taking [the tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Service_Excellence#Tests).


**The Painter**

Our *real* [Master Painter/Craftsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_craftsman) has been doing paint for 20 years and can repair, pick up, and carry damn near anything across the site.


**The Help**

A couple of deck swabbers that clean like the wind. Smart people and all around great to work with and easy to talk to.


**Myself**

I guess I'm the boss, but I don't look at it that way. I grew up in oil fields and ranches around Texas and New Mexico. I've performed my share of mechanics, carpentry, electronics repair, and am a former professional residential and commercial cabling technician, field supervisor, and quality control manager. I also have ten years of progressively difficult, end-to-end IT business systems architecture and information security engineering. I am also 100% self taught in all of these disciplines.

My full resume is 10 pages long and will hand it over to other honest, hard working people whom I feel trustworthy.


There's a lot of good ones, but a lot of bad too. I hate to call you out but there are way to many shitty one guy, day laborers, and a truck deals low balling the hell out of everything, doing an awful job, and giving everyone who does construction a bad name.

* We are the good guys, but you don't have to take our word for it.
* Don't feel bad about mentioning these things. It's prudent and no offense is taken.
* We are far from clueless and don't necessarily "lowball". 
* Our work is worth good money, and we are doing the bidding on our dinner tables. 
* We just need work like everyone else, and are very proud of how we do it.

Because I can only post so much here meeting in person is something I like to do. I've shaken the hands of over 10,000 satisfied customers over the years, and plan on shaking many more.

Thanks for the opportunity to organize my thoughts.

As a side note, we've recently had many tools stolen from a job site, and are having to work even harder to get them back. Generally speaking we can rent what we lost for a day or four where necessary. I mention this as a factor in the estimate given that it may take us longer to complete certain aspects of a job without tools, which brings down the rates, whereas should we have/obtain said equipment then our efficiency improves, thus increasing our rate. It's not necessarily an issue I would ask a customer to consider in conversation, but I'm throwing it out there initially just to air the room.

Does this address some of your concerns? I realize words are worthless without the actions to back them up, but without the opportunity to perform there is no point in even writing this down. **We have references**. 




 About $250 for the labor assuming it's an automatic. Two of us will jump on it so we can knock it out in one day, unless we have to go pull one.

Do you need us to obtain a transmission and any other parts?
 




 No.

We are building the funds, clientele, and crew to earn a small business loan if this takes off.

Thank you for pointing this out, and I apologize for not mentioning it. We do good work and are trying to keep things simple for the time being in order to avoid any sort of conflict whatsoever. Our ideal customer needs smaller jobs done that would not require them to spend very much to complete on their own, but need some honest help. A couple days work at a time is ideal.

 One of the things that really bugged me about systemd was how it was just thrown into some commercially supported distro we were using (SuSE I think), when much of the work we had done on our systems before hand was heavily dependent on the framework of the original init system (System V I guess). 

We absolutely had to upgrade to the new version of the distro to overcome some issues with another package that was central to our business, which was also commercially supported by Novell.

When we staged a few machines we trundled through what amounts to porting much of the lower level system scripting across the canyon of these two distinctly different (at least from our perspective) init systems.

It was not fun. It cost a lot of money. It caused a rift in the team.

As for me, I am used to collapsing system initialization into a small script where everything is basically hard-coded, for lack of a better term, with full paths to executeables and in a sequential order that makes sense from a hardware point of view (look at multipathing over a distributed filesystem, for example). 

It's a practice I implemented at this particular place because they wanted those machines to be able to reboot in 20 seconds, so I ripped out everything that we didn't need, packed up our own RPMS, and it all worked relatively smoothly until systemd came along. Sure we expected to have to do some legwork between distro revisions, but nothing like this.

So yeah, it was my fault, and I'll take a seat at the anti-systemd camp anyway because having such a seemingly fundamental change in the workflow of manipulating services on these machines was not something anyone could foresee when we dove in to begin with. For all intents and purposes systemd, and upstart for that matter, can be construed as a form of vendor lock-in when it comes down to choosing what commercially supported distribution to use.

It aint the good old days, that's for sure. Linux is a fucking beast.

Long live FreeBSD ;)

What you are seeing today is the natural result. 




 A bridge pylon.



A lighthouse.



Improper, respectively.

 




 That's a picture of west Texas, son. 




 Looks like the abandoned airfield outside of Marfa.

Edit: Yup. 




 350 million years of an evolutionary plateau says the cockroach is going to win this war if the sharks are fucked. What does that say about our fragile and brief existence on this planet? 




 I think he's right. We should let big money and agendas do the counting here instead of fairly neutral professionals simply being paid to run some numbers through their nice systems so aptly built for the exact purpose of running numbers.

At least the big money and agenda guys can effect change.

Heh. 




 Nature will sort that one out. 




 U-Verse (now known as Lightspeed) has been a disaster in terms of just getting the easements and permits secured to haul wiring that requires power and weatherproof air conditioned steel boxes all over the place and failover and needs to be within earshot of the attenuation tolerances of cat6 cable in many cases. Jeez.. that gave me a headache to type.

... all through multiple townships and municipalities at a time. The logistics involved in replacing, upgrading, or most of the time, installing those big roadside boxes full of ethernet switches all over the damned place has been a nightmare since day one and is to this day. To say that ATT could just "switch on" higher speeds needs to be kept in context. Where the infrastructure was in place to do so, as with our smug DOCSIS3 cable providers, then it's a no-brainer. However, in most cases the stuff is just not built out yet for ATT to have a magic button to press that exponentially increases your broadband connection.

The cable companies do have that button, though. They have long since installed what's needed to incorporate ~300 megabit speeds into their product line and need only upgrade some gear here and there to make it happen. ATT needs fiber ran and fucking expensive port density installed to do that. They are having to implement a technology used in datacenters, a technology designed for relatively localized and closed off scenarios. It's bulky, archaic, inefficient, high maintenance, buggy, and it's being shat all over the US right now. Sounds just like everything else modern capitalism has done for this world, come to think of it. Hell, this is the poster child for planned obsolescence and ruining best practices. Imagine if everyone on your block had to use the same restroom. It's outside, fifty yards down the street, big as fuck, and a cool 65 degrees inside, but it flushes *fast*.

Cable companies just have a copper wire that they can mux and demux *miles* from signal origination. What ATT is doing aggravates the shit out of me. Leave it to ATT to pound a square peg into a round hole. Their entire super fast broadband implementation looks like ten pounds of shit in a five pound sack. 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fighter_%28video_game%29

The one I am thinking of was a 3D flyer with basic 3D objects chunked together to form a ship that was upgradeable by flying through prize objects. You could get lasers and double guns and boosters and cool stuff like that for your ship to make it more effective and handle better.

I had hell finding the game to begin with and the reason was that the "Star Fighter" name itself was all caught up in a lawsuit, so they wound up having to rename my game to something else, I forget, but it was enough to drive me nuts trying to find it again, and that was years ago.

That game needs to be here, now. The physics engine driving that game was perfect and gave you a real sense of actually flying a fighter jet.

Here it is, in all of it's ground breaking 32 bit glory:

Hey! I found it for the XBox!!

Cool ;D 




 Sounds like a familiar read. I know I could go on forever about it.

Instead, I'll give you [Aunt Edna.](http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~txloving/Mentone%20Sheriff%20Page%201.jpg) 

The article says she was the first female sherrif in Texas, which is not really true. She was, however, the first *elected* female sheriff in Texas, which is saying something... until you hear about how 23 dead people voted for her twice, giving her only a slight edge over the competition. 




 My father and little sister once went to drive a pipeline to check it for leaks, which is usually an easy job unless dad had to order some extra large clamps for bigger leaks.

They left the house early in the morning and didn't get back until very late at night. Turns out a tire blew and the spare was flat, so my dad pulled up to a nozzle on the pipeline and pushed a little natural gas into the spare.

Just enough to make the tire diesel in his face, actually. He had a funny looking bruise the size of a silver dollar from the face of the tire chuck on his bicep, and probably still has pieces of gravel embedded in his skin from the explosion.

He had to carry my little sister, who must have only been 10 at the time, many miles through the desert heat towards Orla. Dad always kept lots of water in that truck, and he had enough tools on board to fix damn near anything. The last half of that sentence is a worth a whole series of books on amazing feats of the DIY engineer.

He always told us to stay waaaay back when he was doing anything dangerous. Even though I was only 12 or so, I was tall enough to drive his truck, and went with him regularly to maintain the wellheads and what not, but sis rarely went. The one time she does go, something exciting happens, and I was stuck at home with nothing but my .410 and rattlesnakes to play with.

Life was tough out there, but my dad was tougher. I will never forget the look on his face when he got home that night. He had bloody specs all over his shirt.

Sis was unfazed. Went right on playing with the dogs and doing the things she did during the summers with Dad.

That was some 25 years ago, and just another day in the hard life of the big man from Pecos. I wouldn't trade a minute of being out there in the middle of nowhere with my dad for anything. 




 Found some tiny black ants that sting like hell here in Corpus this visit. Not sure if they are Crazy Ants, but I know I have never had ant stings go numb like that before. 




 This is about all that country is good for. The only problem I see is aquifer contamination. Some fairly complex and poorly understood, even legendary geology exists in the area. I lived out there and probably still have family living around Mentone. The stories I have heard over the years about theorized oil bearing formations and bottomless springs make me wonder. 




 While I myself have never been accused of making the best decisions in life, please allow me to boast with a humble and constructive certainty that I am not an egotistical douche bag. All of this in spite of such smoldering good looks and sultry wit. As a jewel-cutter of a linguist and jewel-thief of a heart-breaker, don't take this the wrong way, but....

I would go as far as to say that I possess the constitution needed to go on a blind date with even *you* - even after witnessing the carelessly agonizing method with which you mishandle the emotions of others, and more disconcerting, your limited capacity to make the night and day distinction between the train wreck of human emotions involved and the simple impulses of an instinct basic enough to originate from a common part of any brain in the animal kingdom.

Anyway, being in the pursuit of the perfect balance of character, integrity, confidence, and presence necessary to portray my manliness, I have grown to relish the opportunity to wield an exceedingly rare ability to deliver credit where due. I deal in benefits and doubts, and as your awareness of my intentions may be increasing, the implications of the proverbial "catch" associated with my benevolence would be best related (to the good sport that you are) as a curve ball enveloped in the resolve of dust and leather that only a glove resourceful enough to both spank and cover your ass will do.

Today we will learn how that glove can serve to compromise the intent of the pitcher. The trick is to keep your eye on the ball and your mind on the glove, and that's going to be quite a feat considering where your head is at the moment.

Be completely honest with this man. No more or less than a forthright confession. He will *completely* understand, trust me. It's really easy - If the mind can tire of wading in expression, and the heart can mire in the depths of depression, the body must be allowed the shallows of regression or the relationship comes to an end.

Human beings have been endowed with the self-awareness necessary to grasp such concepts. Now all you need to do is take a step away from being human and become a modern woman by finding a way to tell the guy he is charming enough to spring you into a blind date, but repulsive enough to make a freight train take a dirt road. Kind of difficult to reproduce if you can't stand the thought of someone touching you. Something tactful like that.

Then again, look at what modern science has done for humanity. Faces can be swapped. Realistic genitalia has been made obsolete. In addition to many other objects, a woman can now be viewed as an investment vehicle. With as little as $25,000 worth of plastic surgery her net worth increases dramatically, and she gains some proportional amount of pedestal life.

When I was in little league I moved my catcher's mitt all over the place to distract the batter. It worked really well, but only on kids. As I grew older I noticed that it was more of a distraction for the pitcher.

TL;DR: My dad would laugh and say, "Looks are only skin deep, but Ugly goes all the way to the bone." 




 What an atrocious mobile site. Whoever signed off on it needs some critical neural pathways rewired. 




 By sending tiny spacecraft to the edge of the solar system with gibberish imprinted on them serving as TL;DR for our pathetic, self-defeating existence. 




 I worked with a guy who blew 0.12 at a clinic over two days after he quit drinking. At 0.01 an hour of elimination, and correct my math if I'm wrong, but that comes out to roughtly **~shithammerfacewasted**.

I blew 0.18 about 30 hours after I was arrested for peeing [mostly] on a fence, um, somewhere during, um, the daytime,  meaning that I was, by contrast, only **~33.8 sheets of toilet paper in the wind**. The cops did the test for kicks because I went to highschool with one of them.

Small town ;)

I have a portable breathalyzer from Walgreens that is a lot of fun, but I can't seem to find it come to think of it. Late into the night I have seen .3's and .4's pretty regularly, discounting any tests that would read too high due to recent (10 minutes) consumption of alcohol. 




 Sing a song of Sony,  
A pocket full of Yen.  
Magnavox and Zenith,  
Undersold again.  
See the U.S. suffer,  
From the job we do.  
This is how we get revenge,  
For losing World War II.  

For some reason I found this entertaining enough in grade school to commit to memory. It appeared in either a MAD or Cracked magazine of the time.  




 Holy *shit* House of Leaves is scary.

And probably the most impossible contemporary book to truly follow. I had to take notes. 




 Boat probably had the same engines as the whaler that tried to take him in Japan. 




 Talk about adding insult to injury. Wait 11 hours for some "beef" from McDonald's.

Take that $1.29 or whatever it is that you were going to spend and go to the grocery store in the same parking lot and feed yourselves some goddamn vegetables. You can probably get 10 ears of corn for the price of a "cheeseburger" from McDonald's.

Seriously: "HEY WHY DON"T WE ALL PITCH IN ON A FUCKING BBQ???"

Think of all the *beer* you could buy with those people pitching in. A keg or three, a few briskets. Bam..

I'm sure one of those rednecks has a nice pit and there is probably a huge park nearby full of this going on anyway.

Look at me, all pissed. Heh. When I was 12 or so they opened a Short Stop about a mile from my place in Austin. I told my redneck dad I was going to ride my bike over there and grab a burger, and that's what he told me: "Son, that's like adding insult to injury." I chuckle a little to this day thinking about that, and then I remember that his father died of a heart attack at the age of 40 for eating real beef literally three meals a day for most of those years.

11 hours... I do believe you'd get your ass whooped for doing something like that around here... 




 North Beach is a great place to party, but so is Port Aransas, and the water on the Port A. beach is *far* cleaner than the water at North Beach. I would not allow my children in that water at North Beach. There was a post here somewhere recently linking to a website that had a map of saltwater samples up and down the coast, and the area around Ropes Park, not far from where North Beach's terrible samples were taken, was found to be the worst in Texas.

And when I say "water quality" I'm not talking about brackishness.

Don't let your kids swim in that water, trust me. I went to school in Corpus and did a semester of research on pollution in the area. The place is as toxic as it gets and has had some of the craziest birth defect rates in the country. 




 So this got me digging around on wikipedia, and found this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraj_Al_Bait_Towers

Being from the coast and worn out from this long day my first thought was that this was the biggest bait stand in the world. 




 The one at the Dell Diamond after the game was probably the best fireworks show most people in that stadium have ever seen. It completely blew away the one at the park. 




 Is that militia going to escort every rancher's family to and from school and work for the rest of their lives?

Don't get me wrong, I have no qualms about taking matters of self defense into my own hands, and would protect another innocent person with my own life, but I still have rules to play by. 

Smugglers do not.

That's why this is a job for the military and nobody else. We can hunt people half a world a way in the middle of fucking nowhere and "spy on everyone", but we can't protect our own border? What a farce. It's outrageous and clearly indicative of corruption at the highest levels of our government.

I could really rant about this one because it revolves around just how crooked elected officials are in this country. I'd sue the federal government for protection and make them buy me out at market rate if I were these ranchers.

If I were a smuggler I'd watch the fuck out because that corruption is a two way street, and shit rolls downhill pretty quick when it comes to erasing scum in the desert. 




 See: Halliburton 




 I would say it's more formulaic than authentic. You could literally switch around all the nouns in the paragraph and make it sound like propaganda from any country. 




 If you really think about it in terms of genetics all it takes is one generation. 




 Why wouldn't the coast guard set a trap for these assholes?

Shear off the net and put the floats back in the water and watch the damned thing until someone shows up to claim it.

Cut most of the net off, make it look torn or something, and stick a few tags up some of those dead sharks' asses and find out where these guys are going with them.

They are just going to do it again. The CG might have cleaned up a mess, but they are only going to have to clean up a bigger one as the poachers will probably try to recoup their loss and then some.

It's like that "young fisherman" from Mexico they caught in those pictures. I can see that guy's side of things, look at his boat. It's a piece of shit that you probably couldn't sell on Craigslist here in the states at all. Sadly, he probably has a large family to feed. He certainly isn't making a lot of money - but hey, let's be sure to figure out a way to bust his ass.

Don't get me wrong, I'd probably pull up his net and/or report him myself, but it's the lack of sense displayed here by government agencies who would rather hold up "a few dozen" (actually a few *hundred*) dead sharks as a trophy and put the weight of those laws down on the guy who probably just needs the goddamn food.

Nobody ever consults me, I swear.

Well, except my clientele. Unfortunately the CG is none of them.
