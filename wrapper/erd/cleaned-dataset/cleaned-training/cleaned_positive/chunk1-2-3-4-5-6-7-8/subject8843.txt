  There is a significant difference in the interpretation of scientific studies when compared with the desired

Scientific studies do seem to work in terms of statistical significance, as the article says a sleeping pill such as Rozerem makes you fall asleep ~15 minutes quicker and makes you sleep for 20 minutes longer. Considering the potential side affects of the morning hangover and addiction that would seem to be a small benefit. Why do you disagree with this? 




 I sometimes find that I am similar. If I get a good nights sleep then I seem to be punished for it the next day by being awake for about 24 hours even if I am tired after 18.

I am currently trying Magnesium Citrate and 5-HTP which are showing some early signs of being useful, have you tried those? 






















































 Thanks. I had heard a theory that if you already have enough serotonin then neither 5-HTP nor l-tryptophan will help. In fact if they convert to  serotonin then you may end up with too much and not be able to sleep, hence causing insomnia. I guess it works for some and not others.  









 When I can't sleep I find that I MUST get out of bed for a while or I will just lie there awake all night long. CBT treatments will also recommend getting out of bed and going to another room so that you don't begin to associate bed with being awake. It is possible that you managed to get into a light sleep and were then woken up but light sleep on its own is not very refreshing. 

People who have sleep apnoea apparently find it hard to enter REM sleep. There is a possibility that is happening with you as you are unsure if you are sleeping or not. See if a partner ever notices you not breathing or snoring. If you snore and it stops for a while that can be an indication as well. 

I used to get music repeating around in my head - it is infuriating. I eventually got rid of it with a very silly sounding exercise. When ever I noticed it I would think 'STOP' and push the music to the outer reaches of my mind. It took a while (a few months?) for it to completely stop but I have not had that issue for years now.
 




 Has anyone tried these? My initial reactions are hopeful but I am the same with every new thing I try. They often fail within a few days suggesting that I am just getting the placebo effect due to the excitement. It would be good to hear from others who have experience or opinions. 




 You may want to try 5-HTP and or L-trytophran which are both available at health food shops. They both convert into Serotonin which is then converted into Melatonin at night. Commercial Melatonin comes from a cows brain and may not be as good as that produced by your own pineal gland. 5-HTP and L-T are the base building blocks of Melatonin and so may be better.

Commercial Melatonin is also very strong. A healthy adult male should produce about 5-25mg of Melatonin from the pineal gland. If you are taking 1 gram at night then that could be 40 times more than is expected. A book called "Reset Your Inner Clock" describes in layman's terms how having too much Melatonin in the blood when you wake up can shift your next nights sleep onset time by up to an hour. I would hypothesise that going to sleep too early may result in insomnia. cet.org are developing a micronized form of melatonin that mimics the natural cycle of melatonin produced by the pineal gland. Melatonin never worked for me - I am now trying 5-HTP and L-T but I am taking L-T in the afternoon as it seems to make to too buzzy if I take it just before bedtime. 

Are you sleeping now your parents are back?
 




 I saw a TV programme years ago about sleep paralysis. A lot of artwork from the 16-17th century depicted demons sitting on the chests of people lying in bed. That is derived from people experiences of sleep paralysis. 

There are two nodes at the base of the brain near the spinal cord that control waking and sleep. They are meant to act like a switch so that you are either awake or asleep. In people with sleep paralysis they both stay on, so the person is asleep but thinks their dreams are real. 

It sounds scary, I am glad I just seem to have insomnia and not that. Sorry not much use but I found that TV programme interesting - it has stuck with me for a decade or more now. 




 Magnesium is supposed to be a relaxant and I have found that seems to be useful over the last few days - that is all I have been taking it for. Magnesium Taurate is apparently the best absorbed but Magnesium Citrate is also meant to be good - Magnesium Oxide has a poor absorption rate. It apparently works by pulling Calcium out of the muscles which helps them to relax. If you are doing heavy lifting then it may help with the aches and pains and also help your mind relax. 

I also have also heard that Melatonin does not work for some people but does work for others. For those is does not work for then the base building blocks of 5-HTP and L-Tryptophan convert into Melatonin. I found that 5-HTP kept me awake at night and so I am taking it at lunchtime to increase Serotonin levels. Serotonin should then be converted into Melatonin at night. It is too early for me to know if this works for me yet.

All of those are sold in health stores as supplements and so may be useful. They are cheap to try and maybe you will have some luck with them. Good luck!

 




 Could you let me know why you think the article is 'bullshit content'? It looks at 9 scientific studies to form an opinion. You may disagree with the derived opinion but that doesn't make it a 'bullshit content'. If you think the quality is low then I would appreciate your reasoning as to why so that it may be improved. Thanks. 




  sting from a single source, but I do mind posting bullshit

Sorry, I am new to social sites and haven't figured out how to use them yet. I will try to take what you say on board. 
























 I tried for 2-weeks and then stopped as I decided to get tested for apnoea before trying SRT (yet) again. SRT can be brutal and I think a lot of people get anxious about it. A quote I liked from a book called 'The Effortless Sleep Method' is:

"If you are lucky enough to be referred to a sleep specialist, you may be unlucky enough to be advised to embark on a sleep restriction programme." 

I don't think sleepio can hurt in the long run as long as you don't kick yourself if you don't succeed at it. I am not sure that therapists know how difficult SRT is or the anxiety it can cause some people who don't have the willpower to stick with the programme. 




 Good luck kittenmitten. Can you not switch to another doctor if this one is an ass? 




 CBT-I seems to have up to 80% success rates as far as I read and it is well worth re-itterating it's success rates. I think you are also right that sleep forums in general are filled with hopelessness. People who solve their issues get on with their life and don't come back, leaving the forums with only people who have problems!

However I did read a small clinical study involving 5 people where 2 of them failed to be able to adhere to the SRT program. In both cases there cortisol levels increased just before they went to sleep. The study didn't suggest why it rose but I would hypothesise that they got anxious about having to sleep at a specific time.

I also read a book called 'The Effortless Sleep Method' and while I didn't like the 'faith healer' style of it I did contact the author as she had said in the book that many people fail using Sleep Restriction Therapy. When I emailed her she said she had 100's of emails from people who were upset that they couldn't stick to the program. 

I wrote more about this here: 

https://trackitude.com/article/sleep/sleep-restriction-therapy-for-insomnia-more-harm-than-good/

It is also worth remembering that physical problems can also cause sleep issues. Depression, vitamin/hormonal deficiencies or apnoea. If SRT doesn't work for you then push your doctor to get more and more tests done. Many doctors are dismissive of tiredness, so I generally advise taking a friend/family member with you to back you up.

Anyway, a great positive and helpful post - thanks. 









 I think aches and pains can be attributed to calcium build up in the muscles. Magnesium Citrate (500mg an hour before bed) or Taurate (not oxide) can potentially sort that out and can help regulate sleep, it is also usable for depression which also gives aches and pains. Do you also get little twitches in the muscles sometimes? They may be myoclonic jerks (often perfectly normal and possibly a throwback mechanism when we were monkeys living in trees) or to much calcium in the muscles. If you haven't already tried it then pick some up from Amazon or a health food shop. I have been taking it for about a week now and it makes a huge difference to me. Holy Basil (Tulsi extract) may also be useful. I really don't know much about these but my minimal reading so far suggests that they can help suppress cortisol levels. They are both a cheap and easy thing to try.

If it doesn't work then get to a doctor. If you are aching all over then it may be more serious. Maybe take a friend of family member with you who can testify that you have a problem so that they don't fob you off. I felt fobbed off for almost two decades.

Good luck, I hope it works for you.  




 It sounds like you are having a difficult time of things, I have been there as I am sure that many have. 

I have no idea why it came on 'suddenly' but I assume that you have had trouble sleeping for quite a while and it is the '3 days' with no sleep that has come on suddenly. It can be a long path to find something that works for you.

For me the problem seems to have been a magnesium deficiency but it is a little too early for me to be sure. Magnesium is linked to sleep problems, muscle aches and depression (which causes sleep problems). You may want to try Magnesium Citrate or Magnesium Taurate supplements (avoid Magnesium Oxide as it does not get absorbed very well). I take one 500mg supplement about an hour before I go to sleep. You can get them from health food shops or order from Amazon. I have read that you also need Calcium to help with Magnesium absorption but I think a lot of peoples diet are calcium rich and magnesium poor and so I don't take Calcium at the moment - you may want to bear that in mind though if the magnesium does not work on its own. I also take 600mg of Valarian root and Holy Basil (Tulsi extract) at the moment. For me the difference is extreme - I hope it is for you as well.

Some people will also take Melatonin. If that doesn't work then you can try the base building blocks of Melatonin which are 5-HTP and L-tryptophan. They form a chain so that L-tryptophan makes 5-HTP which makes Serotonin which makes Melatonin. Experiment with each walking deeper down the chain if the one above fails. Some people have reported that Melatonin does not work for them but 5-HTP does. 

If you do not get enough light then that could interfere with your circadian rhythm. Try to go outside in your normal subjective morning (whatever time you used to wake up when you felt OK) for 30 minutes. I know this can be difficult if you are very tired but humans developed near equator where the day length is long and sun is very bright. You can also use a light box if you can get hold of one (£150 for a Philips GoLite which is quite good - is linked to age-related macular degeneration though over long periods)

Don't try to do too many of these things at once as it can be overwhelming to try everything, and expensive. I would try one at a time to see what does and does not work. Start with the supplements as they are easy.

Also chat with parents/tutors/doctors that you trust and let them know that you are having trouble. It doesn't do any good to try to fix this all on your own. Close family should try to understand if they are good but I have heard that some can be nasty and unhelpful. 

Good luck, I hope you manage to start making progress soon.  




 My average is 5.42 hours a night this month, often broken and at unpredictable times.

I find that it is not the number of hours sleep that I get but how I feel when I wake up that is most important. Remember that you can get 9 hours and feel rotten or get 4.5 hours and feel pretty good some days.

 









 Thanks for posting the link as it is an interesting twist. 

Maybe I haven't thought about it enough but 'acceptance and commitment therapy' seems to have no underlying difference to CBT. They both try to make you relax. I am not even sure that the technique used is any different:

"[A]CT helps you see how futile it can be putting energy into trying to change the thoughts and feelings that crop up around sleep.

‘It teaches you to accept their presence and let them go, which in turn pushes you towards sleep.’"

CBT also tries to make you 'let go' and so I can't see any difference. Isn't this just a marketing gimmick?  
























 I am thinking about building my first rig to mine DarkCoin, but I am a little short on space. I have a couple of cupboards but neither of them has any air flowing through them and they have the following sizes:

* 3' by 3';
* 2' by 4'.

The rig will have 6 GigaByte 750TIi's and I am wondering about the heat and noise produced. 

The information I have found suggests that the heat will be about 650W. The noise will be about 40 decibels for each card - making a total of about 60 decibels for all the cards and PSU etc. 60 decibels is apparently about the same as a conversation going on about 5 foot away. 

The questions I have are:

* Is such a rig still worth building or am I a little late to the party? I am looking at speculation in the longer term (1-2 years) rather than immediate profit;

* Is the noise from such a rig annoying even in a closed cupboard? I am hoping for little more than an audible hum outside the cupboard and no noise in a bedroom 10ft away with two doors in-between;

* Would the heat would be a problem in such a cupboard?

Thank you!

 




 Yea, that is about the same for me as well. I was forced to start trying self employment about a decade ago due to insomnia. I just about scrape by but it is not good. After about 4 days of bad sleep I also have to have an afternoon nap or I am useless.  









 I haven't tried acupuncture yet but I did do some research into it as I was wondering if the expense could be justified. I wrote what I found out about it here:

https://trackitude.com/article/sleep/imsomnia-and-acupuncture-is-it-worth-the-money/

I won't be trying it just yet but there isn't much you can do with a stubborn problem other that to experiment. 

Your sleep pattern sounds a little like mine in that I would get up to 3-4 nights of half-reasonable sleep in a row and then it would suddenly drop out for no apparent reason. I had recently stopped taking Amitriptylene (Elavil) and things got a lot worse. I then restarted the Elavil along with magnesium which I started taking about 3 weeks ago. My sleep pattern hasn't improved much but my mood is far better and I can cope on the sleep I get. I think that the main thing that is working is the magnesium as I never felt so alert on just Elavil. If you haven't tried it then Magnesium may be worth a shot. Use either Magnesium Citrate or Taurate an hour before bed for a couple of weeks. Any extra Mg will pass out through the kidneys so as long as they are functioning OK there shouldn't be a problem. 60 capsules cost about £10 on Amazon so it is an easy and cheap option to try. I am not sure it will work with PTSD but you gotta keep trying things. I think that Mg works mostly for depression of which a secondary symptom is insomnia.

I assume you have spent time with a psychologist/counsellor to work through the PTSD issues, but if not then maybe that is worth a shot as well.

Good luck with the acupuncture, I hope it works for you and I would be interested in hearing the result.

Lots of people over there are in a similar boat so you may feel at home. Some are very knowledgeable about the reasons for not buying at the moment. It is a shame that government is doing all it can to support the banks and hock people up past their eyeballs in debt. Good luck. 




 That does sound very strange for insomnia. Get another doc as advised as your one doesn't sounds very good. Did he give a plausible explanation? 

I wish reddit would send an email on comment replies. I have RSS but it is a pain to check for things that often never arrive. Sorry - off topic I know! 




 If you are never tired until 5:00am then it sounds like delayed sleep phase disorder. Wikipedia has a pretty good description of it if you haven't already read all about it. There is also a good book about treatment called "Reset your inner clock" by Michael Terman. He also produces a clinicians version that probably goes into far more excruciating detail that may be useful. See cet.org for it. It uses melatonin and light therapy to shift sleep patterns and claims to have had success shifting up to 8 hours in some people. He is also developing micronized melatonin which should work in the body the same as human melatonin. Commercial melatonin is far to strong for people with DSPD as it can shift sleep patterns further the next night. 

However, if you are tired but just can't sleep then that book probably won't be much use.

I wrote a small intro on DSPD and shifting sleep patterns that may be useful if you don't already know about it:

https://trackitude.com/article/sleep/for-some-the-promise-of-melatonin-is-broken/?cas=true

 




 That's good. The jarring effect is like something out of a horror movie or having your brain stuck in a blender.  




 If you are an adolescent then be aware that your natural sleep-onset time is probably later than most adults as your circadian rhythms get pushed ahead from when you were a child. Are you trying to go to sleep before you are tired?

If you are smoking weed then are you sure of its purity this time around? It can be cut with all sorts of crap (glass, brick dust, rat poison etc) and some of that may be giving you problems. Also if you are not smoking as much as you used to then one of the withdrawal effects in some people is insomnia.

For aches and pains then I think that magnesium can help some people. Try Magnesium oil and/or citrate from health food stores. It can also help with depression which can be a root cause of insomnia. 

However, as aherhjerherhaey you should talk to your doctor if your meds aren't working. 

Good luck. It doesn't sound like a lot of fun. 
























 Don't blame yourself for only being able to afford to rent one bed in a shared flat. A lot of this problem is due to the society around us and is not of your doing. In the UK in the 1960-1970's a single labourer could afford a house for their family. They may also have scrapped by but they had more than many do now. That is not your fault. Now it takes two good salaries to have the same as my parents generation did. Again, this is not your fault and being angry about it is only a natural and rational reaction. I and many others are also angry about this situation. So much so in fact, that in Scotland where I live we just had a referendum to leave the United Kingdom. 45% of people hate the situation so much that they no longer want the political union. To me it sounds a little like you are in that group but don't realise how many other people feel like you do. 

I had the same idea that women want that self-assured man with a good job. Many do but that is often because they can't see past the glossy images that the media sells them. Again this is not your fault. That however doesn't solve the issue of loneliness that maybe you have but it may help rationalise it. 

Meeting a good partner is hard and you may need to turn over many rocks to find the diamond. Your lack of experience could actually be a selling point. My partner is impossibly jealous at even the slightest hint that I had a past relentionship - regular arguments for 4 years. I actually think this is inbuilt into many people. That makes you a catch as any partner would not have anyone to be jealous of! I like Star Trek and in one episode the chief engineer says "Their is no roller-coaster as bad as marriage". I know it is impossible without the experience for you to make a good comparison but many people feel trapped in their relentionship. They would often like to be in the position you are - single; however that is only possible to really understand with the benefit of having been in a relentionship. 

When I was in your position I met a woman. After I got to know her she said I was literally shaking when I first met her and she thought it was cute. The relentionship didn't work out but it shows hows odd things can sometimes work in your favour.

"barely able to function in a world full of people doing adult things" - I think that adults only look like adults because they are taller than children. I think that people look different than how they feel. That means that other people see you as an adult even though you don't feel like one. In return you see them as adults even if they don't feel like one! The saying is "The only difference between men and boys is the size of their toys".

Many people don't know what they want and all you can do is try something and see if it fits you. 

 




 Nope, your not retarded. Your story shows that you can communicate well and as Followingtom says you are a hard worker and generous to your family. That is a quality to be proud of and a good woman will realise that.

It seems that you stayed so that you could talk to this girl. I am 44 but at your age I often tried to get to know girls in a similar, subtle way to you. In my experience it doesn't work. You need to ask them out. Maybe you can think of it as going out with a friend rather than a date. After all most good relationships between couples are actually just good friendships that eventually go a stage further. 

Once you know if she likes you then you are more in control of your life. If she doesn't then you wouldn't need to do the overtime any more. If she does then you can skip the overtime and spend time with her instead. 

I liked a girl and I was down the pub with her and a few friends when I was about your age. I loved her eyes and and while keeping my eyes firmly fixed on the TV due to embarrassment I said 'Wow - nice eyes!'. She thought I was talking about the TV and not her and I didn't have the courage to tell her - even more silly was that I knew she liked me! That was an opportunity missed and I never spoke to her again. I wonder what my life would have been life? My point here is make a decision to either ask her out or not. That way you won't have the regret of not trying.

Some people have rules that they won't ask a work colleague out as it could cause difficulties. That is fine as well. It will take guts to ask this girl out if that is what you want to do. You just need to decide how you want to play it. 

Maybe you could find some other activities as well. Do any of the sports centres have activities you could engage in? Maybe a local cycling group, board game group, martial arts, guitar lessons or even night classes. You may meet people there that you would make friends with and through them you could meet more people.  




 Having a pact with your friend sounds like a good idea. I like walking and often go on my own. I use the time to rant about all my problems and how much I hate other people. Can you still go on the walk and talk to yourself? I do it all the time. I imagine that I am talking to the people I know while I walk. I use their voice in my mind to keep the conversation going. If you do that then maybe you can tell your friend about it. You could tell your friend that you enjoyed the walk with them even though they weren't there. Maybe it will cheer them up and make them laugh - they can comment that it should be you in the psych ward and not them! It you make them laugh then you will have done something good. 

Regarding the problems interacting at the party, don't be to hard on yourself. I spent years with people who didn't like me. I wasn't very good at talking in groups bigger than 1 other person. I was good at the skill set that brought us all together though and I don't think they liked me for that while at the same time being socially unskilled. The point is that there will always be people who you don't get along with - that is their problem and not yours. It could also be that they are also struggling with something. 

My best advice regarding conversations is to speak your mind. I don't mean to say 'I want to kill myself' to a stranger. I find that in a conversation it goes like:

Person1: hey how are you?
You: Good you?
person1: I'm good

at this point your mind is either blank or you can only think of silly things to say. If your mind is blank then try to grab something, anything at all!

You: You look happy
Person1: Er ... lol, yea sure
You: How come?
Person1: It's a party and I get to drink!
You: Yea, drink helps me forget about work.
Person1: What do you do?

and there's your entry into a conversation. From nothing to something silly/embarrassing ('You look happy') to a personal conversation about what you do.

For me this was a difficult thing to learn. Conversing is a skill like any other. The person you spoke to ended up walking away anyway so what have you got to lose by saying something stupid? 

I hope that your friend gets better soon, and just because they aren't here doesn't mean you can't imagine talking to them while you walk. I also hope that I wasn't teaching you to 'suck eggs' with the conversation pointer. Apologies if so but then I figure that any conversation is better than none! 




 Try to remember that this is the hardest time of year for many of us. The expectations of being happy and enjoying the festivities can be over whelming. I don't know if it is true but someone told me recently that Christmas was the time of year with the highest suicide rates. If you can hang on a little longer then the festive 'fun' will be over and forgotten. I think there are more people feeling the way you do that you realise, they just don't say it. I hate this time of year myself and also struggle with it.

So many people say New Year is time for a new start. It isn't. It is just another day in a continuum but with added pressure forcing us to show pretend happiness. I expect that most of the people filled with joy are actually pretending. They will get back to their reality shortly and the forced pressure to enjoy this time of year will be gone. Maybe that will ease your burden a little if you can hang on for just a while longer. 

I don't know what country you are in but organisations in the UK like the Samaritans are trained to listen. Even if you just phone such a group and hang up without speaking you can look at that as a first step and congratulate yourself that you have done something very difficult. If you can say hello to them, even better! They will probably start the conversation with you. Don't worry about making a mess of such a call, they are not there to judge you and they exist only to listen to people who are desperate. The Samaritans are volunteers and are there because they want to help. You won't be putting them out or wasting their time. 




 I used to when I was younger but it has changed now. For me the problem with living at night was that it was impossible to hold down a job in my area of expertise. This is the reason that I am always trying to sleep only at night.

I also found it also makes having friends difficult as they are on a different schedule. I found that it also gets very lonely (and sometimes cold if you can't afford heating) at night when there is no-one else about.

I haven't managed to succeed yet but I try to stay in a 'normal' routine now. Sometimes I get lucky and can hold it for a month or so before it it gets difficult. I then have to 'reset' things to a 'normal' pattern which is very annoying and sometimes difficult.  




 I was 27 when I first went to the doctor and I also agree with the others. 

You need to tell the doctor the truth about what you are going through or it will reduce the changes of getting good help. It is difficult and embarrassing to talk to a complete stranger but remember that they are trained to give support to people in your position or refer you to someone that can. You are not the first to go to the doctors and discuss such issues and hopefully the doctor will understand that you are struggling. I would expect that doctors have learned to be non-judgemental of their patients so try not to worry about what they think of you. I have been in tears in the doctors office before now when I was finding things difficult but that doesn't matter to me now. If they don't try to help you then it doesn't matter what they think as they are a bad doctor, if they do help you then it won't matter that you were embarrassed. Maybe you would find taking a friend with you who understands a little about what you are going through useful. 

If you have the energy then I would also advise reading up on how others have tried to help themselves. The doctor will do their best but in the end you are the one who is most interested in getting better. Personally I find that high dosages of magnesium are often helpful in elevating my mood. I have a theory as to why here http://goo.gl/C0nbY3 (increases neurons and the binding strength between those neurons and serotonin). It isn't 100% effective but it seems to help significantly.

I am also using L-Tryptophan (serotonin facilitator) and I am experimenting with CBD (Cannabidiol). They are all available from health food stores and Amazon.

Regarding meeting new friends then maybe there is a local activity group that you could join? meetup.com is the website that I use and it allows me to physically meet people who have similar interests. In fact without that site I would have no friends. 
 




 I agree with mylittletarget. 

Don't beat yourself up to much about what you can't do. Give yourself permission to take time out for yourself. Give yourself the time to begin to get better even if progress is very slow. I just took two months off and am just today starting to think about getting back into my usual routine - you aren't alone in feeling the way you do even though it sucks to be there right now. Sometimes life will throw you a curve-ball and all you can do is go with the flow. Don't compare yourself to others because they probably don't have your problems. 

If this is a recurring issue then think back to the times this happened before. Realise that eventually things did get better last time and maybe they will this time as well. 

Maybe try to give yourself only one task a day or even every other day. Maybe it is going to the shops, doing the laundry or even just having a shave/wash. These things can seem like mountains at times. When going up a mountain it is best to go slow in order to conserve the energy you have. Give yourself permission to treat yourself if you can, a double treat if you accomplish your task for the day - maybe an extra chocolate bar without feeling guilty.

I am being presumptuous but it sounds like maybe your were raised by foster carers. Could you find a forum and read about how others have coped with the issues you are having? Knowing that you are not the only person who has faced this problem can be a useful perspective to have. Maybe finding people who discuss similar issues to yours can be one of your tasks for the day.

Good luck. 




 Thanks for all of the great replies. There is a lot more to mining that I had initially anticipated and your answers have helped clear my head. It is much appreciated. 




 Thanks for the reply Scrapper89.

When I first started looking into this the DRK calculator was giving returns of about 300 coins annually. The last few days it has been suggesting returns of about 190.

As I could pick up 150DRK for about £1,000 and that is the same as the cost of the rig then the trouble to set it up should be for fun and learning rather than profit.

Increasing the block reward from 5 to 12 increases the annual return from 190DRK to 458DRK. That return would certainly make it worth the effort. However:

http://drk.poolhash.org/graph.html

Suggests that the average reward to date looks like 8-ish. With a 7% block reward reduction occurring in 9 months (?) time I assume I could expect the reward to be down to about 4. If so then that gives a reward average over the next 9 months of about 6. For the rig I am thinking about then that would return about 175DRK over the next 9 months - and then a serious decline. Have I got that right? 

 
























 Fantastic and interestingly artistic! I love the isolation and loss of social skills that finally end up in learned helplessness. Thx. 




 If you go out into the sun you will also generate vitamin D from the interaction of cholesterol and UV-B light. Apparently a lot of people with depression are also vitamin D deficient. Easy to test with a supplement but peoples amounts vary vastly from 1,000 to 20,000 IUD's a day. 

Depression makes work harder ... so does the sun. Maybe they are the same thing? 




 Thanks for the useful info. I hadn't realised that anti-depressants won't work as well without sleep. I wonder if it is correlated (no sleep and ADs fails to do the job) or just that poor sleep makes people feel worse (ADs still do same job but sleep is the problem).  




 Sorry, I was so fixed on my insomnia that I forgot that some people just want to sleep all day when they are depressed.

I used to wish that I was the sort to have hypersomnia rather than insomnia. When I was on the high dosage of Ami I was so groggy that I couldn't stay awake. I always struggled to stay awake and I hated it. I guess that it a little bit how you feel each day. That would suck. I guess that the grass on both sides of the fence is a kind of withered, dried brown.

Why haven't you tried medication? 




 Thanks. It worked very, very well for me last night. One night may not make an omelette but it does appear to be an interesting development for me. 

Did you ever find yourself developing a resistance, or it varying in effectiveness on your bad days? 

My doc said the same thing about the low/high dosage. It did make me wonder if a high dosage no longer acts as a sedative but that sounds improbable! 




 I used to just stare groggily at my computer monitor all day pretending to work while really getting very little done or plain old doing it badly!

Thanks for the clear answer, it is appreciated. 




 I did 30 days without my usual 20-30mg of Amitryptylene. I did supplement the withdrawal with L-Tryptophan (don't know if it was useful or not), vitamin D (people with depression and apparently low in it), B-100 (as vitamin D increases the bodies use of it), Valerian root and melatonin. I chose not to taper down all though I was only on a low dosage. Originally on 100mg but I was so groggy in the morning I reduced to 20mg and stayed there for years.

As to being a light sleep, I wake anything up to 5 or 6 during the night so I guess that makes the answer yes. 

Thanks for replying, it sounds like you feel that depression causes you to sleep worse rather than a lack of sleep causing depression. 




 I always find it difficult not to follow the sleep hygiene advice. I know if I sleep, even for just 30 minutes at about 3:00pm then I will feel a lot better. The problem is that is hard to do if you have a job, and it upsets sleep at night. Hence I try to stay in that 9-5 routine in the hope that one day I will be 'normal'. 

That said I agree with you that sometime you just need to sleep at odd times. A small amount of feeling refreshed is sometimes enough to give me the strength to get through a bad patch.

It sounds a little like you think that sleep is the root problem, would you say that is accurate for you? 




 I was on 20-30mg of Amitryptelene a night for years but I stopped 30 days ago. Just went to the doc today and was given 25-50mg Trazadone. 

It sounds like your insomnia is a symptom of depression but you did say you slept lightly. Do you think there is a chance that the light sleep is the root of your depression?

Thanks for the reply. 
























 I would recommend the Phillips GoLite. It is small compact, re-chargable (lasts for about 3 charges) and provides a pure blue light. I tested the pureness with some blue blocker glasses and it was close to 100%. It is the equivalent of about 10,000 lux. A very nice piece of equipment. It is a little expensive though at ~£100.  




 I hadn't heard that bright light actually makes people sleep for longer (51 minutes as the article mentions). I though it just changed the time at which they fall asleep. I wonder why they reported less sleep related anxiety? I would guess at a placebo effect there.

I did a lot of reading on the effects of blue light in relation to sleep onset times a while ago. It effects peoples phase response curves to make them fall asleep earlier or later depending on the time of day it is used. I detailed a lot of information about this on my blog at:

 For me depression is characterised by a thick foggy head which makes it difficult to think. The feeling that even doing a simple task such as picking a sock up from the floor or having a shower is like climbing a mountain. I can feel exhausted after getting ready for work in the morning. Depression can make it difficult to enjoy life and isolates you. You do seem to be going down a route of isolation if you are thinking about leaving school - but maybe the early stages.

I was as you describe when I was younger. I hated school and didn't understand why I was there, I still think that schools are really just big nurseries where society puts children so that they don't cause trouble! They are not places of great education in my opinion, they are places that frequently create sheep as fodder for society.

It could be the initial start of depression, I think that racing thoughts are common but they may be more linked to anxiety than depression. The smoking may be your attempt to self medicate. In the long run you may want to educate yourself on the effects of THC when not combined with CBD. It is common for skunk to have 12-15% of THC content but very little CBD. CBD is the cannabinoid that protects against mental health issues.

My best advice is to talk to a counsellor or psychologist but make up your own mind as to whether to follow their advice. They often don't seem to be much use either other than for emptying your wallet - but I am maybe a little cynical as others seem to have had great success with them. Don't be afraid to change counsellors if you do go to one, find one that suits you and that you can relate to.

If you have good parents then maybe you can chat with them and let them know what you are thinking and feeling. They may be able to help with support and advice. I may be scary to approach them but good parent will want to try to help.

Good luck. 









 I managed to get rid of this but you are only the second other person I have seen mention it regarding sleep. 

When the song started I would mentally imagine pushing it to the far corners of my mind. The further it went the quieter it became until it vanished. I would imagine a big hand doing the pushing. Whenever the music starts I did that. After about a month the repetition stopped. It was a bit of a pain to remember to do it but I got into the habit eventually. I often avoid listening to Lilly Allen as some of her songs go round in my head for some reason. As someone else says maybe it is a touch of OCD.

Hope that helps you as well - good luck. 




 I'm maybe slightly unusual as I think I eventually found out that it is allergies that keep me awake. I don't have a lot of info on why that is yet.

I know that killing dust mites for two hours a week, not eating any dairy and Trazadone has recently been magic for me. The odd thing was that the allergies weren't an obvious thing for me. I also take vitamin D (15 time the RDA) which massively improves my mood but I live in un-sunny Scotland. These videos explain the vitamin D link with sleep very well (http://goo.gl/QqzGw4).  




 Nice to hear the comments about how other people think the same way as me sometimes. I am an atheist but often pray for a heart attack when I go to bed - a little illogical I know but I like eccentric. 

Frequently when I hear about someone dying in the news I think that they are lucky. That might sounds awful from a normal perspective and I am sure that neither they nor their families think that way, but I often wish it was over. 

I have never really though about it before but I had never considered whether or not I was the only person to think that way. I never even saw the thought as a deeply sad place to be in until now. It is nice to know that there is some company in that place though even if there is no way to communicate with it. 't would be even better if that place didn't exist and there was no-one there! Maybe I should make that my next prayer to the god I don't believe in. 




 For me things feel more hopeless as I get older. After 25 years it seems harder and harder believe that I might get better. For me it is that hopelessness that makes it harder as I get older. 

I don't think it is irrational at all. For me it is perfectly logical. If you have tried everything to get better, if you have little help and support, if things are falling down around your ears and you have little hope then not wanting to bear the pain any more is easily understandable. 

Must try to have hope though, must keep working on it.

Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to work I go ... 




 I'm sorry to hear about such a negative comment. It is easy and justified to feel slighted. I know these comments are hard to take but it is also worth trying to understand things from the perspective of people who don't have depression, especially if they have been a good friend in the past.

They can't instinctively understand the pain that depression causes. They can only form it in terms of sadness and tiredness - which are not the same thing at all. It is work for them to empathise and try to take that additional step into the head-space of being depressed. Sometimes they get it wrong, sometimes badly so. Everyone get things wrong in life, that is part of the learning experience.

Good friends are very difficult to come by. I have hardly ever met anyone who gets in touch with me to see if I want to go out. When I do I value them highly as they are special. 

It is OK to feel they way that you do but that is also the thinking that causes isolation. Take a break from your friend and maybe in a few weeks when the pain of the comment has subsided you can arrange to meet up again. Maybe try to think about how you can gently explain how the comment hurt you. If they are as good a friend as they seem to have been then they will eventually take the comment on-board.

Of course, if there is no hope for this person then fuck 'em! Not everyone we meet in life is a good match for us!

Good luck! 
























 I recently switched to Trazadone and found it useful. Maybe you want to try switching to something else. Amitriptyline is another one that some people say is good for sleep. I found it useless having used it for nearly a decade (yea, I'm stupid) so I guess that it depends upon the nature of the problem and maybe your brain chemistry. Maybe Trazadone just isn't good for you.

I am in Scotland and the light is now starting to wake me up at 6am. Are you sure that it is the Trazadone and not something else that is causing you to wake. Heating coming on and making the room to hot or giving you a blocked nose? It is always worth trying to think laterally to ensure what you think is the problem, really is the problem. 




 I used to find that sometimes that type of thinking would go away with a breathing exercise that I used. I would lie in bed and then force myself not to breath for as long as possible. My diaphragm would want to move but I would prevent it until I couldn't hold any longer. I didn't hold as if I was in a no-breathing competition but just until it was uncomfortable. I would then breath in. This helped as it meant that when I breathed in I was breathing in from the bottom of the diaphragm and not using the chest muscles. I found this quietened my thoughts down and I would drift off to sleep. It wasn't 100% effective but it did work quite often. 

As you say, the thinking is probably a symptom of something else (stress) and indicates a greater need to relax. Maybe you could stop the thinking by saying 'Forget it!' each time the thoughts start. By learning not to think about work or other life stresses and put them aside for the day you will find it easier to sleep. 

It can be really difficult to solve but don't give up. 




 Sounds a little like sleep apnoea. Are you aware of that issue and it's effects on people?

It normally comes just as people enter REM sleep. The throat closes down and air cannot get to the lungs. Two types: Central and Obstructive (but their is also mixed). You may get headaches the next day due to lack of oxygen. Attacks can happen many times an hour and as the sufferer is asleep they don't realise what is happening. As the attack happens they wake up to stage 2 sleep meaning that they are not in REM sleep very much during the night. Higher risks of heart disease and accidents etc. Can be very serious.

You can get it tested for at a sleep clinic, hire a CPAP machine if you wanted to test treatments for yourself, watch these videos for treatments using Vitamin D and B100 (http://tinyurl.com/oazpp5b) or use a Oximeter to measure blood oxygen levels while you sleep. If using Oximeter get one that straps to your wrist, they cost about £100.

Here is my more detailed article on it: http://tinyurl.com/p27vwj2

Good luck. 




 Wow, I have had my share of troubles but I am grateful that I don't have anything like that to deal with. 

It would seem to me that the root of the problem is that your dad is very lonely. Hence he is grasping at such an improbable straw to try to connect to the world. My first thought was that maybe you could gently help him to find other ways to socialise and help him build his confidence. However, he would need to be in a far better state of mind before you could begin to work on that. You clearly have a lot of work to do if you are going to provide support for your dad. Your counsellor(s) will be by far the best person to provide support for you and your sister. They should be able to make good suggestions on how best to communicate with your dad.

My suggestion would be to, as gently as possible, explain to your dad that you think he is very lonely. Tell him that is normal for a lot of people (maybe you have been there yourself) but that things can get better. Explain that you would like to help him and that he doesn't need to feel embarrassed about talking to you because you love him and want the best for him. Maybe you can invite him to some very small social events sometimes so that he can learn to build his confidence. Maybe a walk with you and a male friend of a similar age to your dad, or a drink in the pub (that's what bars should be called!). I would suggest passing this idea through your counsellor first though if you can get a few minutes with them in the next couple of days - a phone call would be enough. Your dad clearly needs support now.

Good luck in dealing with this. It must be a very worrying time for you and your sister. 




 The CBT method is automated with a supportive community at http://sleepio.com. It costs about £6 per week and is typically 12 sessions. It is sort-a like that which buschic described with some additional stuff thrown in.

I would also highly recommend watching these videos on how an American doctor cured patients of their sleep disorders using vitamin D. It is really quite a detailed amount of information. http://tinyurl.com/oazpp5b

Magnesium helped me fantastically for about a month and then became less effective over the next 8 months. It was so successful for a while that I read a lot about it. I condensed my research into this PDF: http://tinyurl.com/qaawma8

I found that I was allergic to milk and dust mites. The only symptom was an occasional blocked nose and only when I lay down for 3 hours or more. Once I stopped taking dairy products there was an enormous improvement. I need to look into the possibility that even a gently allergic reaction could cause severe insomnia. However it is worth bearing in mind in case you have a similar problem.

Good luck on toughing it out on your smoke withdrawal. I always used to wonder if recreational drugs caused my insomnia. 25 years later I was glad to find out that it is extremely unlikely! 




 There are plenty of people in life who will pull you down. Some do it on purpose and others don't know they are doing it. Either way you don't need them.

Try to find groups that engage in your interests and see if you can make friends with the people there. You'll have something in common with them and a reason for getting to know them. It will take a bit of time to get organised and maybe in the meantime you can find some things to do on your own. Maybe find places to cycle or walk in your spare time, join a martial arts, yoga or fitness class. You'll eventually bump into some people who seem OK. When you do you can see if they want to get togehter to do something like the pub, film or snooker. 




 I'm sorry to hear that you are having such a hard time of things at the moment. It can be very, very difficult to keep trying to find ways to improve your situation. From my reading some meds can take up to 6 weeks to kick in and it may be a slow improvement from there (although I am not knowledgeable in this). Don't beat yourself up about taking meds. It is not a sign of weakness.

Many years ago I was struggling while working. I decided that I had to leave the job and make my new job the task of trying to improve my situation. It was a lot of long nights sat on my own not being able to sleep and sometimes I would get so desperate that I would sit and read about things that can cause depression. I would then resolve to try that thing, going to the shop the next day to buy some mineral/vitamin supplement or ordering a light box. Each time I did it I found that I got a little hope. It was often dashed when it failed and I was back at square one. However eventually I came across a couple of things that started working for me. They only worked a little bit and I had to find several other things as well. Over time I started to get more and more hope. For me there is now a light at the end of the tunnel - if I can reach it. The point I am trying to make (albeit clumsily!) is that for me, some of the worst times were when I had almost no hope. 

It is hard to force yourself to read about what could be causing your issues, and it is also hard to try to implement the solutions. However we know that you feel rotten and there is a reason why - either biological or emotional. If you don't know the cause of your depression then trying something you have not done before may be that one solution you are looking for. It is very hard work, but take it one step at a time. Maybe you could:

1) Read up on different medications and set a date to visit your doctor in a months time and ask for a change - assuming your current med continues to be ineffective;
2) Read up on vitamin/mineral/allergic causes that have caused your depression. Then go and try that supplement;
3) Read up on the effects of light on mood (chronotherapy) and maybe buy a light box;
4) If your family doesn't know what is going on then make a resolution to chat with them (if they are generally supportive). they may be able to provide support.
5) You go running, so maybe you could join a group and one day when things are not so bad for you go along to it. You may meet some interesting people who could alleviate your loneliness a little bit. Also remember that some people actually choose to be hermits or solitary monks. There is nothing wrong with that path. You may be forced to walk it for now but maybe you can find solace that you are fighting a philosophical battle. One day it may be over and you will have an active social life again. There is nothing wrong with being single or allowing yourself to enjoy your own company. 

Just try one thing initially. Give yourself praise that you are at least trying your best even if you think your efforts are feeble - they aren't, you just have a very, very difficult problem to solve.

Good luck. 




 It didn't help me but I am fairly certain that my issues were caused by a mixture of vitamin deficiency and allergies (touch wood, fingers crossed etc.). There is plenty of evidence to suggest it works for SAD and delayed sleep phase disorder. 

There is an interesting book called Chronotherapy (renamed as 'Reset Your Inner Clock') by Dr. Michael Terman who set up the Centre for Environmental Therapeutics. You may be interested in that if you think that light is the source of your insomnia.
