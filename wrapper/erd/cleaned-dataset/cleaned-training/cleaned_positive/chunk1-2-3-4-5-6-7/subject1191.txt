 No, we are not hungry and it's not funny! 
























 400$ in a week? wow, I made that much in a month when I had a job.. Before my nervous breakdown.. And that's a good beginner salary here in my shitty country. I just can't force myself to work in a 9-5 job with negative people to earn a bare living :// but congrats for you! I know how hard these things for us, while others have no idea why we're anxious.
