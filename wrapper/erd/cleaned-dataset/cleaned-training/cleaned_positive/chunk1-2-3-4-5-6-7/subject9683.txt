 nice :D 




 Pekovic isn't a great defensive player either. 









 U got Kik? 




 At the end of the day Salmons, Stiemsma, heck even Kwame Brown and Smush Parker all of them  Andrea Bargnani. 




 And what if Bennett plays to full potential, you could have Brewer, Martin, Thad-Young, and maybe trade Pekovic and Barea for a good backup Center or PG. 




 Unfortunately, The Knicks and Kings have a much better chance of getting Rondo, if we trade anyone, we're done. Let's see how Hibbert and West lead the team this year. Maybe Stuckey can put up big numbers, his stats when he got starter minutes were just slightly worse than D-Wade this season. Let's hope Solomon Hill is a decent player. Lastly, let's hope Solomon Hill doesn't become the most improved player and Larry Bird does something stupid like trade PG, like they did with Granger, and let's hope they don't trade Hibbert for Monroe, cuz Monroe is only gonna demand a huge contract or leave in free agency. 




 Don't get too fancy, I would recommend at most, a free throw line finger roll, to look like you're gliding. Jump from as far as you can. 




 I love Singleton, but I feel like Dahntay Jones, Jordan Crawford, or Ronnie Brewer would've been better. 









 idk if firstrowsports.eu has fiba, but u can try 




 Another thing i forgot to add, is
If i make another Cavaliers Mix in the future.

What would like to see?
1. LeBron 
2. Love 
3. Irving
4. All 3?
5. Waiters
6. Other (comment suggestion)

 thanks for your sympathy...
...but i thought Joel Embiid was coming back later this season?? 




 :) i made it, glad u enjoyed it, im a pacers fan, but i cant wait to see what he can do.  




 we should waive Rasual Butler or Donald Sloan 

i really want to see some better players :( 




 I'm thinking since we didn't get Shawn Marion (the next juwan howard, riding the bench for rings)

Maybe Dahntay Jones, Ronnie Brewer??

or should we go for more offense? 









 but people could troll youtubers who upload things to their second channels. 




 it looks like this for me http://prntscr.com/4hld2c

 Hi, I don't know if people are still looking at this. But....without further ado..

My name is Tim, I posted gaming videos, sometimes Chatroulette trolling, and occasionally a tutorial. 

I do have a capture card for PS3 gaming, but I need to buy HDMI Cables and PS3 HD/AV Component cables

I'm only 15, and I've had a YouTube account since I was 9 lol, but this channel isn't the one from 2007, I made this to start a new chapter in life.

I struggle with depression and anxiety like many teens but I'm also very socially awkward so YouTube is my way to escape from reality, somewhat.

I don't really like posting just gameplay, I like to discuss thing, I'm just not a vLog person so, I commentate over gameplay.

I hope you enjoy my content and subscribe.
Remember it's not an obligation, only subscribe if you like it.

 Have you ever thought of embracing the fact that you made a mistake. For instance, I once did something on instagram that made me look gay in front of most of my friends, but I eventually embraced it, if I accidentally did something "homo" I'd just say "oh well I guess I'm gay" and people would laugh. Soon everyone forgot.

 (Disclaimer: I'm black.)

My Alien Pet ::
Name :: Jerome (pronounced Jay-Roh-May)

My pet is the Realest nigga alive, and non-humans ain't even considered niggas, but that's what makes Jerome unique.
You see in 1993, Jerome landed on a planet called Kintekai, it was the land of Fried Chicken! Jerome lived there for 21 years. On November 4th 2014, Jerome appeared in my room, he was tall, muscular, looked like a human, and had real nigga traits, he had a high top fade, 8 pack natural abs, and he would sweat grape drink, not grape juice, grape drink. Anyways, Jerome didn't introduce himself to me like a normal alien (e.g. "I come in peace."), instead he(at least I'm assuming it a he, due to his name and appearance), introduced himself like this: "Yo Dawg, is you Timothy?" To which I responded..."Yes, but my parents are asleep please keep it down", he then proceeded to say: "Nah, nigga, don't worry b, only you can hear me, infact, you can respond to me, using your thots, I mean thoughts, I was sent from the planet Kintekai, to be your pet, but I don't play dat homo sh** mayne, no offensive to gays, but by pet, I don't mean no intimate stuff, iight my nigga?"...I said "lol...alright"(yes I actually said 'LOL') then we played some 2k, and then I checked reddit and saw this...so yeah. 




 In elementary school (kindergarten to grade6)
kids would sing [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoVPzYbGFQw) 














 Oh alright, thanks. 









 Well maybe a SG/SF, that can play SF this year then move to SG when PG13 is back. 














 Lance was amazing, i do miss him, atleast he's the same old Lance we all love :D http://i.imgur.com/rQgd6wg.gif 




 9+10= ~~21~~ 19 




 what is this thing im seeing in some people's posts(on /r/FreeKarma) about reading capchas or however you spell it? 




 trade Scola for a decent SF maybe? 




 I love that we still cover news on Lance, He's a Pacer for Life!! #PacersNation hopefully he comes back after his contract is up. 



















 I remember commented on a Lakers post about Julius Randle.
As a Pacers fan, I understand what it feels to have multiple players injured (george, west, hill, watson). 
But if you saw how Roy Hibbert played (22pts 8reb 7blk), i can guarantee you, someone will step up, whether it be Ibaka, or like you said Perry Jones, someone will. I'm sorry for your lost, and  I don't really understand how bad it might feel, playing in a strong West Conf.
But nevertheless, I wish you guys the best on your season. 




 I'm a Pacers fan, and I understand how you guys feel **completely**
Just like how Paul George has MVP potential.
I believe Julius Randle has the potential to not only be a perennial all star, but the face of the Lakers franchise down the road.
Competitiveness aside, I wish you guys the best on your season. :) 









 isnt Hill, West, George, Mahinmi, Stuckey, and Watson injured
and like Rudez cant shoot, and SoloHill isnt really scoring?

Hibbert's doing well, some games are weak on the boards, but he's looking good. 




 yea, Lance only hates Evan Turner.
 




 George Hill
Knee Contusion 




 I'd be satisfied if Hibbert just completely forgot about offense, and put up Ben Wallace numbers:

2005-06 B.Wallace: 7.3ppg 11.3rpg 2.2bpg
(Roy might average more blocks though.) 









 i still say its worth it, im just pissed off with that fact that i cant use VC on MyCAREER cuz it doesnt connect to 2K Sports server, so idk if i can play crews or myplayer blacktop anymore.

it doesnt say i cant play it, it just says offline MyCAREER means using Skill points instead of VC..

i hope i can still play blacktop online or crews if i ever find people to make one 




 its okay, i mean, its worth it, if the server work for you.  




 update just lost 80-54
KD had 40 pts 18-18fg
 




 (i own a ps3 copy of the game)

only graphic changes are Nick Young's hair, Anthony Davis and Jimmy Butler have mini afros, and Chandler Parsons looks real for once, they still haven't given Steve Nash the hair he's had for so long now, since he joined LA (2k13).

and the 2k sports servers are retarded.
every time it autosaves its supposedly "retrieving your files from the 2k Sports Server" for like 50 seconds

and when i create a MyCAREER, it says im unable to connect to the 2k Sports Server so i either play offline MyCAREER or get sent back to the main screen with KD on it. 

Then when i go to load the MyCAREER, instead of letting me go to edit my player/play game/look at my player, it sends me back to play the **Rookie Showcase**

When looking for a match online the game stays at 
**HEAD-TO-HEAD**
**Searching for matches...**
until you cancel it.

2K Heroes mode also doesnt work because...you cant match up with anyone to play online.

MyTEAM is undergoing maintenance.
Wait...hold on, im trying right now
it'll be a while since its **RETRIEVING DATA OF WHATEVER FOR 3 HOURS**

*takes chill pill*

alright, im making a team, since i cant make a MyCAREER....actually maybe i'll check out MyCAREER and see if it works, now that MyTEAM works.
i named myTEAM the Toronto Lynxes...cuz apparently the "Lynx" is native to toronto, or something like that.

My starting lineup is Canaan, Rivers, Joe Harris, Jeremy Evans, and Sims

OH look i can play someone .__.
so whats wrong wi- **HOLY SILVER PLAYERS**, Kevin Durant. omg, k well, im about to lose cya :D 




 No, by "Final Chapter" i mean, the last few years, his last run at success in the NBA, and stuff like that. 







































 lmao wow. 









 im not from indiana, im from toronto, but im a huge pacers fan.
I wouldnt boo him at all if i was there, i love Lance. 









 And Screw The Wizards Fan talking trash to PG last year. 









 IT JUST CAME OUT LIKE HALF AN HOUR AGO FROM THIS POST. :')

 Great, now that new change to rule 1.


Now my dreams are gone.

Shouldve read first.

This is why my life sucks. Welp might as well delete my post. 

I'm just going to have to get fake followers and hope for recognition, my dreams are ruined, and the sad thing is, now i'm coming off as more of a attention seeker, and now people definitely won't care, but then again, I don't know how this subreddit treats people with dreams like me, idk if they're trolls or caring.

 i like chilling on pokemon showdown, and they have other smaller servers and i can get a custom avatar on those, so i'm wondering if anyone could make a White Walker 80x80 trainer sprite png?

Also i tend to mess up on subreddits a lot, so i apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to ask. 









 well hot damn...

 Note: I'm only 17, my parents probably won't purchase things like After Effects, and I got Sony Vegas from this thing on YouTube that shows you how to get it free. I've also tried to get After Effects and Photoshop free but it doesnt work ;~; 




 alright, well I'm complete noob to all this stuff, I'm only good for making little sports mixes and all that easy stuff, what I would like to know is.

* Can Sony Vegas (Pro 13 if it matters) do this cool VFX stuff I'm seeing you guys post?
* Is there a program that's free that allows me to do all that cool VFX stuff? (If Sony Vegas can't)
* Are there any tutorials you would recommend me watch?

Hopefully, this kind of post is allowed here, if not please direct me to the right subreddit to ask.

EDIT: the word "stuff" counter: 4 times :P
 




 The Trade:

* Cavs get Iman Shumpert(NYK) and JR Smith(NYK)
* Thunder get Dion Waiters(CLE)
* Knicks get Lance Thomas(OKC), Louis Amundson(CLE), and Alex Kirk(CLE)

Knicks also waived Samuel Dalembert.

Thoughts on this, will we have to make change to compete with them next season? 




 well alrighty then.... ._. 



















 wow, I've always loved watching video edits and things like that, and I got into making little sports mixes on youtube, but I've always been interested in VFX and how it works, im only 17 so idk if my parents would pay for software to edit like that, I was able to get Sony Vegas Pro 13 for free online, but anyways, I just want to say what you posted has definitely inspired me to really give vfx a chance, is there any free software that allows me to do this, and also any recommendations on books or youtube videos on how to learn vfx? 




 Sony Vegas Pro 13 




 didnt watch the game today :\


how did the fans welcome granger? any videos of it? 




 Jennifer Lopez who?
Halle Berry who?
You look amazing for your age! 
I rate 11/10 




 Dat ass 




 lol 




 I'll be so pissed off if this show ends, I love Bella Thorne(plus shes hot), because of this show I like Astro after I thought his X Factor performance was cheesy. I was really liking how Leo and Kara were turning out after their relationships ended or whatever you want to considered it, and I really want to know what happened to Emma. 




(P.S. Dr.Naday's accent is cool as hell.) 




 Stuck, Scola, Mahinmi(or Sloan), 2 draft picks for Lance
i'd take it, but it looks like he gonna go to Brooklyn ;~; i miss you Lance. 



















 preferably one track, but if you need to put a Top 3, Top 5, that's fine too.





My Favourite is [February Confessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m7gMKLMkqE)...The Instrumental is soooo good, and his flow is nice. 
























 Right [here](http://images.rapgenius.com/72181c67bf2cbfcfb0509e89e6d821c9.500x253x45.gif) 





























 and Maseo's stunt double in the Katana fight, it didn't look like him  




 or maybe he eventually ends up in the Lazarus Pit and begins to like red again, and becomes a supervillain.  




 Not gonna lie, I burst out laughing when I saw his face. As if Felicity could do anything, but that speech he gave her....my grodd....it was amazing. 




 I think she becomes Mia Dearden, just because her middle name is Dearden and she was called Mia in Corto Maltese. I hope she can deal with Oliver's absence though. :\ 




 If this is the end..... all I can say is "I loved you Diggle, and at least you didn't die first." 




 The military men were Olicity shippers that worked with Eobard Thawne, they knew that in the future, Ollie would get laid. They needed to keep the timeline intact. 




 If this episode's Ra's Al Ghul was a YouTube video, there better be no dislikes. It's almost as if he had a change of heart, and he saw their pain and didn't want them to suffer. He didn't even kill Sarab. 









 If you put the translate to Spanish to English, and type in Eobard Thawne, it comes out in English as Professor Zoom. If you put the translate to French to English, you can put Barry Allen, Slade Wilson, Laurel Lance, and get Flash, Deathstroke, and Black Canary.

andnbsp;

I haven't found out the rest yet, but I'll update this post if I find more, or if you guys find more.

 This episode was worth committed suicide over. Not fucking Zayn Malik. I don't know where this show is going but my stomach hurts and I feel like crying right now. 




 HUGE SPOILER: Tyrion joins the League of Assassins and becomes the next Ra's Al Ghul, then he kills Piper Chapman, right in front of The Flash!

 I have no DSLR Camera or anything like that, I have no lighting, and I have nobody but myself. Are there things I can do that don't require actors or setting up stuff to film?

Note: I'm starting to get into VFX so I may not be so familiar with all the different terms and programs to use.
 




 LOL me too, he likes "WTF she's alive, wait I can't look angry, Oh Hai!! :)"

 Wasn't there another crossover episode, I swear I saw Lance and Detective West in a promo. 




 I love the Vi one, Riot needs to come out with a boxing glove skin for Vi. 




 alright, thanks. i hope none of Team Arrow dies ;~;  




 Season 1, Episode 1, first 30 seconds.


andnbsp;


I beg to differ, my good sir. 




 I'm not a huge IMDb user, but in Episode 21's cast.... literally nobody dies. Is this confirmed? or just put on IMDb and will be changed once it airs or once episode 20 finishes.


http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4006598/?ref_=ttep_ep21 




 inb4 Oliver gets news that Walter died or that metahuman dies. -_- 




 I think this season is more about how Team Arrow evolves, and less about Oliver as The Arrow. That's why it's so emotional, because the rest of Team Arrow has so much more humanity to them compared to Oliver. 




 Black Arrow as in Diggle in a green suit, or Dark Archer? lol
 




 it's a shame he might die next episode :( 




 It's most likely Roy, but I like what /u/Fishtosser123 said


 Diggle will die and be reconstructed by Palmer as cyborg 




 i like that idea. 




 I like that theory, this show is about the origins and the journeys of many heroes/villains, (e.g. Green Arrow, Deathstroke, Black Canary, Deadshot, still kind wish they had Sara league of assassins flash backs to show her time away from Starling, but maybe that will be a spin off series.) If Deathstroke got his suit, and Green Arrow got his beard at the end of the 5 years, then I don't see why we can't see [this Deadshot](http://i.imgur.com/wFN7pMK.png) plus it's a metal suit, maybe (just my theory) Ray Palmer invents a fire resistance flak jacket for him, and he joins Team Arrow for a couple episode, but ultimately returns to his villainy. 














 Is it over, because im new to the game, and i just made an account like a few hours ago and it didn't say anything about maintenance. 





























 Who's Hotter? Lyla Michaels or Amanda Waller? 




 Fuck Thea, Marry Laurel, Kill Nyssa, Divorce Laurel, Kill Felicity, Revive Nyssa, Fuck Nyssa, Marry Thea, Fuck Cupid, Divorce Thea, Fuck Sara, Fuck Sara again, Kill Lyla, Marry Diggle. The End. 




 Make John Diggle buff as fk. 




 I didn't like the special effects until the ending fight scene with the heat vision... that was nice. 




  Hal Jordan will appear. Maybe not as Green Lantern, but just as Hal.

But they mentioned a pilot going missing on The Flash? Maybe he appears as a normal human in the flashbacks? or an alternate universe where ever Barry went.

andnbsp;

Also what about Slade Wilson, Walter Steele, Joe Wilson, or expanding on the story of Oliver's child.  




 Ted Grant is still alive.  




 Who is the mayor now anyways? Is it like Ray Palmer or something, cuz didn't the mayor get shot by Sarab?

andnbsp;

Also Oliver as Mayor would be awesome, it would be a good time to introduce new characters, maybe a new member to Team Arrow? or bring back the salmon ladder, and by salmon I mean Colin Salmon, Walter Steele. 




 He did it in Season 1 Episode 4 with Peter Declan, he's already fought against Mirakuru on the island, and God knows what in the 2 last years of his time away from Starling City, could he, prove Harrison Wells as the killer? Or even find out Harrison Wells' true identity? 




 DIGGLE!!!! 




 The nerdgasm I will have, if he meets Hal in the flashbacks as a regular guy, then meets him as Green Lantern in the present. 









 * Laurel


* His Baby Mama


* Sara


* Shado


* Year 4 away from Starling (TBD)


* Year 5 away from Starling (TBD)


* Diggle


* Helena Bertinelli


* McKenna Hall


* Laurel (shortly)

 I know, but ya never know what's going on in the heads of Berlanti, Guggenheim and Andrew "you know" Kriesberg. 




 I posted earlier that I was rewatching some of Season 2, and in Ep2x16 "Suicide Squad", when they're all talking to eachother and getting in position, they called John Diggle "Freelancer" and on the DC wikia (i know that's not anything official but) when you go to [John Diggle] (http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/John_Diggle_%28Arrow%29) and look under aliases, you see Freelancer, and it links to [this villain](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Freelance), it also says he's an enemy of this superhero named Triumph, so maybe Triumph will be introduced? Also off-topic, but Lyla Michaels in the comics is Harbinger who has some connection to Supergirl, so just a heads up on  possible future crossovers. 




 They hinted at H.I.V.E. trying to purchase the earthquake generator when talking about Gholem Qadir. Just shows how ahead of the game the writers are, I hope to be that some day. 

andnbsp;

Also: http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Gholem_Qadir 









 actually looking back at my post, i don't think Deathstroke could be a main villain, cuz what would he do different than in Season 2? Oliver has nobody anymore, and by Season 6, Speedy will be able to protect herself. 




 I'm hoping that maybe Roy Harper is pulling a Malcolm Merlyn. Maybe sometime in Season 5, the police agree with The Green Arrow and they get the news that Roy Harper faked his death and he's welcomed back to the probably renamed 'Star City' by Ray Palmer. 

Also, my thoughts for main villains to prolong the series.

Season 4 - Damien Darhk

Season 5 - More H.I.V.E. stuff/Return of Deadshot

Season 6 - Deathstroke back(will appear in both previous seasons in smaller roles)

Season 7 - Merlyn

Season 8 - Chien Na Wei 

andnbsp;

idk just a dream :3 




 I think we've gotta give a hand to Manu Bennett, he portrayed Slade so well. 




 What's AO3? 




 You know what, I might be wrong, I found a discussion on Wattpad from a few years ago, where this dude had a problem finding a target audience, and wanted alternatives, and this comment helped me realize my problem http://www.wattpad.com/forums/discussion/comment/5738047/#Comment_5738047 




 nah, I wasn't mocking, it's just that I don't think Wattpad has much variety in readers, most of them are teenage girls looking for something about One Direction or some cheesy romance story. I guess it's just not the right site for me :( 




 I have an account on Wattpad (and fanfiction.net, but anyways.) I'm writing a story about the shows 'The Flash' and 'Arrow', basically my version of how they will go on after Arrow Season 3 and Flash Season 1. Is it considered a fan-fiction? Because every time I look at a list of fan-fictions, it's always about some teenage girl meeting Harry Styles or about Harry Potter and Hermione's love life, and I never see regular adventure or horror or crime or science fiction stories, it's always romance. 




 If you look at the list of Green Arrow villains http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Green_Arrow_enemies

All of the main ones have appeared, except Onomatopoeia.

The rest are dead, arrested, in an A.R.G.U.S. max prison, or leading the League of Assassins. 




 Oh please keep this up, we want more.

I want to start making a fan-fiction on Arrow and The Flash, but I suck at planning out things, I usually just go with whatever comes to mind, then see where it takes me -_- 




 Eddie dying doesn't destroy anything either, they couldve stopped the blackhole... but The CW lied with the episode title...

They weren't "Fast Enough". 




 HOLY CRAP YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT! 




 Not sure how they will get out, now that's i've heard all of your different perspectives, but I think with Barry coming next episode, Starling City will be saved with another S.T.A.R. Labs cure like they did with the Mirakuru. It seems they are just amazing at "reversing" things. 




 LOL yes xD 









 I think it was the insulin that General Shrieve had in the flashback 




 I think Maseo tricked Ra's and brought him the insulin from General Shrieve. 




 That was amazing, the acting was great!  




 Same! xD 
























 Oliver Season 1 - *"Nobody can know my secret"* / *"Malcolm Merlyn, You have failed this city ... The Undertaking. It ends now."*

andnbsp;

Oliver Season 2 - *"The city still needs saving. But not by the Hood. Or some vigilante who's just crossing names off a list. It needs something more."* / *"Yeah, I'm done. I'm done taking the blame and I'm done caring. Why don't you go have a drink. Get wasted. Go to Verdant. I'll pay for it. I have loved you for half of my life but I'm done running after you"*

andnbsp;

Oliver Season 3 - *" It's more than that. I just... John, tell me honestly... What have we accomplished?"* / *" I don't even have a regular plan."*

Yea something definitely changed in Season 3.

 It upsets me that when you search for fanfiction on Wattpad, all you get is something about One Direction or another boy band or YouTuber. Whatever happened to things like idk Spongebob meets Jimmy Neutron, or Avengers vs Justice League, or something that takes a character from a book/tv show/movie and expands their story? What also upsets me, is that if it's not about 1D/YouTubers/etc., it's about Twilight or some movie/show and it always focuses on romance.

andnbsp;

I have recently become quite fond of writing, and I would just like to voice my opinion. 


NOTE: I do not mean to offend anyone, any fandoms, or the authors of the fanfiction genres I dislike.  




 Truth is, this is my first time ever watching a show live. I binged watched Season 1 and 2 then starting watch Season 3 live around 'Draw Back Your Bow'.

andnbsp;

and it scares me to think, that it could end soon :'( 




 Correction: 

andnbsp;

*Lifts Vibrating Hand*


Do you know how hard it has been to keep all of this from you, especially from you? Because the truth is, I've grown quite fond of you. And in many ways, you have shown me what it's like to have a son. 

andnbsp;

*"it" happens*

andnbsp;

Forgive me, but to me, you've been dead for centuries. 




 me too haha. 




 ;~;  




 he can still guest star or come back in later seasons. 




 True.  




 No he doesn't, Harrison Wells asks Felicity to tell him The Arrow's real name, to which she refuses, saying "That's not my secret to tell" (Which is what Oliver told her when they revealed his identity to Barry in Season 2)


Then when coming up with a plan to stop ape-shit Barry, Wells tells Felicity to call Oliver Queen, because they'll need the Arrow's help. 




 First off, we know that H.I.V.E., Damien Darhk, and some more Diggle stuff will be covered in Season 4. But lets look at all of the things they haven't covered. 


(Feel free to give me more things to add to this list in the comments below.)

andnbsp;

* There's no way the China White (Chien Na Wei) story is over
* We've barely seen Komodo
* We haven't seen Onomatopoeia
* Slade Wilson and Digger Harkness were former ASIS members and are both imprisoned on Lian Yu... coincidence?
* More Katana?
* If Oliver meets Hal Jordan or anyone else in Coast City in Season 4, I don't think their relationship will only last 1 season
* Oliver's child
* Merlyn Al Ghul :o
* Though I doubt they'll show this, Lyla Michaels has powers in the comics.
* What if they finally get Blue Beetle on here
* More Diggle/Felicity villains
* I hope to see more Brick
* I can't believe they kinda threw this character away but hopefully there's some way to bring him back, Constantine Drakon
* Jake Simmons/Deathbolt was in Opal City when the particle accelerator went off (Probably will be covered in The Flash though)
* Roy Harper, what's gonna happen with him, will he ever be able to come back to Starling City
* Starling City officially becoming Star City?
* Sara is back, Quentin Lance reaction to that?
* Cyrus Gold.... Solomon Grundy? o_o
* The Huntress ?

Okay, that's all I've got for now

**EDIT:** More uncovered things:

* Russian mafia flashbacks
* Raisa, the maid from Season 1.
* Thea meeting Barry. 




 Well groddamn. 




 We all know Eddie, Eobard, and Roy Harper are pulling a Malcolm Merlyn, they'll be back in the latter half of Arrow S4 and Flash S2 then be season regulars in S5 and S3. xP 

andnbsp;

EDIT: and by Eobard, I mean Matt Letscher from the flashbacks and a brief moment in S1E23 




 My 2 theories are:

andnbsp;

* He heard Felicity tell Barry "How'd it go with Oliver ... Did he really do the thing with the arrows"
* He asked Gideon 




 "You possess true courage". 




 Because in the song 'Uptown Funk', he says "Don't believe me just watch" 




 Damn... if that's what he mean't, we're screwed. I'm fine with Olicity to an extent, I personally loved those scenes where Felicity would say something inappropriate to Oliver then have an awkward pause, or the "You're my partner", "When you are there (Central City)… it just made me realise how much I need you here.", and "You'll always be my girl, Felicity" scenes. They just need to learn how to balance the romance and the action. So it's not full on Twilight love story, or not full-on beating up bad guys, like *cough* [This edit of TDKR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J72GOv3G738) 




 Writing an Arrow/Flash fanfiction on Wattpad that probably won't get any recognition due to the millions of stories about One Direction by 14 year old girls. I just got ganked by the whole team in top lane of League of Legends, I was playing Shen, then my team forfeited.

andnbsp;

I might also watch Constantine, sad it got cancelled, I'll see how good it was. 




 Sorry, didn't know how to word it :( 




 I don't think you should be considered a hero until you can protect your city/world all by yourself. 









 Did they ever explain how Barry would return to the current time. If not, how does he do it? How did he use the speedforce to go forward 15 years, if there was no Hydrogen particle colliding with him? 




 You lucky bastard Grant Gustin.

andnbsp;

My Grodd. 














 I write fan-fiction, but like... legit fan-fiction, not anything that pushes romance up your ass. I like to write the supposed continuation of the story. 




 I picked Katie, but I think Katrina Law(Nyssa Raatko/Al Ghul), Rila Fukushima(Tatsu Yamashiro) and Cynthia Addai-Robinson(Amanda Waller) 




 *facepalm* 




 For a second, I couldn't tell if that was Iris West(Candice Patton)... or McKenna Hall(Janina Gavankar).

andnbsp;

Still don't know who it is. 




 LoA.

andnbsp;

Why? Oliver took down Cyrus Gold without a cure. The League is more populated than a couple dozen....or maybe more escaped "super-prisoners", and they are skilled in fighting unlike some, if not most of the prisoners that might be used to street fighting or just using a gun. 




 Dallas Mavericks need to have a Deron Williams, Monta Ellis, Chandler Parsons, Chris Bosh, Lamarcus Aldridge, Dirk team. 




 Warriors win the 2015 NBA Finals. 




 Blue/Gold teams Congrats guys. Got a bit of a scare there near the end. But ~~JR Smith~~ Golden State sealed the deal. Again, Congratulations. :) 




 oops I was supposed to post this on another thread, hence the "Canary Cry" correction, it was some season 4 dc thing, and Katie Cassidy said like "Canary Scream" or something
