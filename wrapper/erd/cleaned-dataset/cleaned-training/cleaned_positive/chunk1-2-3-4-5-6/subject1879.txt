it blew my mind at the time 




 I want to go back into counseling. I am miserable right now: not enjoying anything, over compulsive eating, not wanting to take my meds etc. but I'm on my parents insurance and I feel so guilty for burning through it if I go back to counseling. What if something bad happens (god forbid) but the insurance is all burnt out because of me?

 I have a hard time growing out my hair without it getting for lack of a better word, gross. Been toying with the idea of extensions for awhile, and finally let go of some cash. I'm still learning how to blend them and how to make them look best, but its been fun and overall im pretty pleased with them! These are synthetic.

 I bought jessica simpson HairDo clip in extensions and i love them. im on a college budget so i got the synthetic kind, but i believe she has real hair ones too. got them off amazon! my only complaint is the netting/weft thing is a little big for my head, but i make it work.

 I have the same problem. Let's go we're in this together  




 Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in your brain. So even if you're consciously trying to be happy/positive, your brain won't let it last. The chemical imbalance causes you to have low mood 




 It's kind of a funny story  




 I got my tonsils out last summer and it was the most painful thing ever and this is my worst nightmare LOL I am so sorry.

 Hi Loseit!

I was wondering if anyone has or has ever tried an online fitness or weight loss coach. I was curious about how much it costs and anything else you are willing to share about the overall experience?

 Assisting them casually or in a work atmosphere? just curious!

 A Home Based Program Worker for a branch of The Arc
-i got kicked out of a nursing home bc the people working at the agency were fucking morons and didnt have an appropriate professional relationship with the home
-nursing homes smell like poop and diaper all the time and hearing people moan was something that happened constantly
-had a client with ID who the supervisors didnt teach her that it was inappropriate to call me 30 times a day (literally)
-was manipulated into working with a client with a lot of medical problems who needed her colostomy bag (poop bag) changed, her period pad changed, i had to lift her and wasnt nearly strong enough/prepared
-was told to spend 6 hours with a client with basically no idea what to do 

its endless. if you live in central PA and are in the human services field, talk to me before getting a job.. 




 Kevin Breel was supposed to talk about effective social media use at TedXyouth, because depression and suicide was too serious/deep. He talked about it anyway, it spread like wildfire on the internet and now he's touring the nation. Any thoughts?  









 yeah no thats totally helpful. right on.  




 thanks for sharing. im a crisis counselor and getting a male's perspective in your situation is harder to come by. sorry for what you've been through and congratulations for getting the heck out!!  




 no way. was in a bad environment/situation, and when that was resolved i stopped  




 hm. valid point, I think I knew just by growing up in society that that was one of the uses of smoking. I was at a point where none of other coping mechanisms were sufficient

 hugs. ive been there. i swear on everything it gets better.  




 thanks for sharing this with me 3  




 Ned Vizzini. So, so much. 

I read It's kind of a funny story after being diagnosed with depression. I was 16 and it gave me hope. It was semi based on his own experiences......and then he committed suicide.

still gives me chills 




 Does your hair look sexy pushed back?

(sorry) 




 Always hold the door open! 




 Introverts get their energy from being alone, and extroverts by being around people

 ill definitely check out Best Deceptions. Glad you liked the song, it wrecks me.  




 Ace Enders-Motion 




 Yeah the mom thing sounds about right :( so I'm thinking about things that don't cost money...it may sound silly but are there any support groups in your area for people with mental illnesses? Sometimes just being around people that feel similarly could help tremendously ya know  




 Hey..sorry things are so rough right now. You must feel at a complete loss. Have you ever gotten professional help for this? 




 Yeah, this is me, always. It's where the awful assumption "people aren't depressed they're just lazy" comes from. I think getting engrossed in tv or not harmful thoughts pushes away the bad thoughts. Or sometimes I can't clean my room because I physically can't get up and do it, not because I don't want to. It sucks when people don't understand. I think it's good you're recognizing it at least  




 Thank you very much  




 Hey guys,

I was wondering what everyone's favorite or go to self care is when they are feeling down. I used to go to eating, but now thy a I'm seeing a nutritionist and trying to stop binge eating I'm looking for new ways to promote self care within myself.

Thanks for any advice in advance 




 Every damn day. Thanks for putting it into words  




 Thank you. You put it into words. 




 it was a little too close to a swastika for me know what im sayin

 I was 16. I was sitting on a plane and my mind was RACING and I was on the verge of tears, which was a common occurrence for me. I was looking around and realized this probably was not normal and everybody else on the plane wasn't going through this. I told my mom I needed help. 

I'm 20 and doing ok now :) there's just one last unhealthy behavior I'm sorting out

Thanks for asking

 Stunning transition. Stunning.  




 Beautiful story. You look fantastic!  




 im not a usual Morrissey listener, but maybe?!?  




 no, thanks though!! 




 ha, not quite. but thanks for the try! 




 As I was getting over a heart break, a song appeared in my head and I can't for the life of me remember what it is or where it came from. I'm imagining a male's voice, like a singer/songwriter maybe, singing "you don't ever want to see me again, so you won't." Theres a chance it could be "I don't ever want to see you again, so I won't" My google searches came up empty. Anything? At some point I found a John Mayer song with similar lyrics but that wasn't it.  




 Lol I told her my cousin was pregnant and was moving in with our family and I had to be around to help. None of that was real life.  




 Mmmm no haha. Screenshot before the swiping!  




 The best way I can describe it is it feels like you are drowning underwater and you look around and everyone is breathing fine.  




 That sounds awesome  




 I'm 21f from nj, also diagnosed with depression. Hearing a males point of view on it would be pretty neat I think.  




 Oh my god. That didn't even cross my mind  




 Mazel tov

 That's not you tho? 




 Oh hello  




 You betcha 




 You are rad, too.
