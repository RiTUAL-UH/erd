 emm I'll have a look :) please post here to get the community going :) thanks for the interest, I'll look for the seeds now. PC/XBLA? 




 Whoever said that looks like a penis has a pretty fucked up pair of balls 




 Hey r/minecraft, 
I recently made a new sub for players and fans of Survival Island. There you can post seeds/stories/links and posts related to the Survival Island style of playing Minecraft. You can also post sets of Goals/Objectives to be completed in game.

It's only a new sub, So it will need admins/moderators, but most of all it needs a community, There isn't much on it now, but hopefully we can kick it off soon, So any Survival Island fans on r/Minecraft, Let's get this community off the ground 3

www.reddit.com/r/survivalisland 




 awesome! 




 1. Build a minecart rail
2. Craft TNT
3. Construct a watch tower at least 15 blocks high

5. Build a fireplace using netherrack and brick. (stone/clay)
5. Create a full set of iron armor.
6. Build a tree house :D
7. Start a farm, 6 plants minimum.
8. Craft Red wool, Blue wool and Orange Wool
9. Enchant a chestplate

Feel free to play on hardcore ;)

 So uh...I see your "report" succeeded... :) 




 whatever, It's only a post :) 




 haha how? 



















 This has more than likely been brought up before, but I would really like to see different colored beds in the the game, Eg. The normal bed recipe with green wool = bed with green sheets. They recently did something similar, different color planks of wood. I think it would be a nice feature in the game.

 Fair point, and I fully respect your opinion, but I mean 2 million is a huge number of subs, surely they're doing something right

 that's a brilliant strategy :) I will try that myself :) 




 No problem :) 




 Ah but the bed is featured, indicating that this relativity map is of at least Beta 1.3 




 Night is on its way, but do you dig down and sleep off the night in a dingy 3x3 dirt hole, or do you dash to a village and sleep safe inside the warm walls of a house?

 Precisely ;)

 Yes, unfortunately :'( 




 I fucking love you guys hahahaha 




 I agree 




 Hmmm, I can't remember the original source as I've had this image for about a month, But I would recommend a Google Image search for 'minecraft relativity diagram'. I will have a look around for you and link one to you if I find a bigger version ::) 




 Knew you guys would love it ;)

 Personally, the posts on this sub intrigue me, but are they some people out there, maybe even on this sub, that get off on this stuff? 




 Maybe it's because I'm not a gun-crazed American, but I don't get how this is on the front page

 I live in Ireland and looking for a low maintenance spider thats easy to handle and is calm. Average room temperature around here is 21ยบ celsius which I think is around 60/70 F. I dont want to splash out the cash on a heater as I just want a low maintenance spider. What would be a good suggestion for an absolute beginner? And should I raise from a spiderling? 




 Never heard of them 




  I have been handling spiders I find for a while and havent been bitten. As far as I know they're so small the bite is painless and not noticeable 




 Thanks,  great answer. Georgina it is! 




 Answer: Quite simply, There are no big insects on the Emerald Isle! 




 How do you differentiate between male and female spiders?

 Could be a recluse, That shit is dangerous 




 Its ok, the NSA will remember for us. 




 Nah, she looks about 16 to me 




 I agree great story, That's what the spirit of a spiderbro is all about!  




 Great answer, this really cleared it up. 




 From hearing all these heartwarming fables and tales of arachnid loyalty and bravery, I really want a spiderbro. Thing is where I live, Ireland, there isn't any big guys out in the wild. The biggest wild spiders you get here have a body the size of a large pea, and that's no exaggeration. I had a spiderbro once when I was young, Unnamed but valiant and the time has come where I want a watchful guardian, who protects me from the pesky flies of irish summer, a spiderbro like Viktor, or Gustav, a brave companion to stand tall for the summer months, but all the big busters (pea bodies) are nowhere to be seen. Anyone know how to attract a house/bath spider? (Bath spider is what I've always called them, as they always climb up the drains and chill) This would be a big help as I'm allegeric to most insect repellents, which is ironic. Thanks guys. 




 Oh my god this is so beautiful :') RIP Spiderbro 




 Most of you guys here own an arachnid so I'd just like to know why I see a lot of dead spiders on their backs with their legs curled in. 




 I kept watching this when I realised it looks like there's a dick on his shirt 




 'A metric shit-ton' is my new favourite phrase 




 Ironic how the god of floods is found submerged for over 1000 years... 




 Anyone see the little face with the orange lights and grill before anything else? 




 It's just like modern art, ugly, beautiful,  all depends on the eye. Personally, I like it. 




 I particularly liked the skulls 




 I've seen enough Final Destination movoes to see where this is going... 




 Nice post, poo_smudge 














 Simply block the other accounts when they appear, it will stop them coming up again. You still get all the tweets from your favourite comedy feeds and much less spam.

 Hey bud, I found a seed for 1.2.5 :) It's 2475069397829075708. 
It has only one tree, many resources (diamond) and an easy to find dungeon, and also some sugarcane. Hope this helps. Can you please advertise and support this community so we can find other survival fans like us :) Best of luck with your survival island :)

 Ok well first of all, by the expensive headset on your neck and the fact youre indoors in the dark, I'm going to be bold and assume you're a hardcore gamer. If this is the case (and I could easily be wrong) I'd recommend getting out of the house a lot.
  Go out to malls and observe the other guys there, not in a homosexual way, Look out for their hairstyles and types of clothes theyre wearing. Also might be an idea to look at the attention theyre getting from girls, say do they have a gf with them or is he talking confidently to a female store clerk. If you you fond a certain style or hairstyle that fits,  go for it!
   I would recommend getting active! Maybe you already are, but heading for a run once a week, or playing an intense game or sport with friends for an hour is great for you. You will notice your skin will start to look better and also your body! 
  From the picture you look like a real nice guy and a great, warm friend. But I'd take into account the steps ive given you and try up your rating even by 1 :)
   Also, this entire paragraph is from a guys view, so call this 'bro to bro' advice. 
  Hope all goes well! :)

 All I'm seeing is Finn fucking the shit out of that sword 




 I love how the guy is just there like 'dammit, not this shit again bird' 




 I live in Ireland so trust me heat is not a factor here in winter! 




 A tarantula need only eat a cricket once a week to survive healthily and happily. They can live up to around 3 weeks without food I believe, depending on the activity of the spider. However small spiders can fast longer because their bodies dont need as much fuel. Hope this helps! 




 Must be hard for this little guy to find food, great looking spider. Post this to the guys over at r/tarantulas, They love seeing high-def pictures like this! 




 I'm a big fan of spiders but this really took my breath away

 Sir. You have won. *high fives through internet machine* 




 Thank you very much, I will check it out 




 I posted this out of curiosity, And received 3 positive responses at this time. The rest are either sarcastic, satirical or demoralising mockery. You've really done your organisation proud. I won't be darkening the door of my local lodge here in Ireland in Gorey, county wexford. To take heed from this thread, While I'm aware my title could be offending, the majority of freemasons do asshole things some times to outsiders. 




 open your eyes and read non-fiction. It's all there. 









 Do you ever see some reslly good carts come in and pick a few out for yourself? 




 Chile Rose Hairs have a good temperment too!

 I thought they were going to get rid of TF2 when I read the title of this post. Was pleasantly surprised 




 the guys over at /r/tarantulas would love this! 




 Mind fucked me. Really weird way of looking at things,  I like it though 




 That's horrifying! But it's not your fault, The world has a weird way of doing things. Some day you will hear a phone ring and remember that moment,  and something amazing will happen to someone you care about. Some day. 




 You can have another magical intetnet point from me, Butthole Pleasurr

 I'm an ass for never doing this 




 I wish I didn't start biting my nails 




 I'm glad the moose is safe too. 




 I have had a few moments like that which I've never told anyone because they'd think I'm insane but here seems like the right place.

I remember when I was about 15 or so thinking out of nowhere about the singer Whitney Houston, only ever heard her name before, never even sprung to my mind. I felt really sick that night and couldn't sleep, At this stage she had compeltely slipped my mind. She was dead in the morning.

The same happened with singer Amy Winehouse. She hadn't made headlines for a few years and randomly popped into my mind. Same again, nervous gut, sickness and she died within 2 days.

I'm not a big believer in spirituality or a spiritual dimension, but I creeped myself out and still remember them years on. 




 Pokemon and Skyrim hybrid on the Occulus Rift. I would never leave my house again. 




 Don't be a dick man 




 I wish I didnt slit my arm so hard that night so that now cant wear t-shirts in summer 




 Fucking depression man! Pisces Christ it won't give me a break and let me be happy for at least one full day. I wish more people knew about me. I wish I had someone
