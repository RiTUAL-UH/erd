 Basically, you turned Bruce Wayne into Adam West, minus the plot devices 




 I meant for the purpose of this thread, but I didn't see anything along the lines of overused characters in my flair list, but since other threads like to love on a character for a day or two, my thread will be just fine 




 I figured Ditto would transform Into the first thing it sees with Imposter,  so in theory, couldn't it transform into someone else?  




 I'm only asking because the anime never seemed to give a conclusive answer for ss2 winning,  imo. The Manga might have expanded on it better. Also, I tried to put the time limit on for fairness, but apparently I created a Lolstomp 




 This whole thread just became "can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?" 




 r/whowouldcirclejerk 




 What if he doesn't see MMH first? Who would Ditto likely see in that case instead? 




 Yes, this has probably been done before, so if there are previous threads discussing my idea, by all means, link me to them.

My thought is that Goku would only have about half an hour or so on Earth in SS3 and he can't hold the form for too long. Would he be able to defeat Majin Vegeta in such a short time span (something like 7 or 8 minutes) using SS3,  given their fighting styles and knowledge of each other? Defeat here meaning incap, since Goku wouldn't kill Vegeta at this point in DBZ.

If Goku cannot defeat Vegeta in that short time span, then allow Goku the full hour or however long he would be allowed on Earth in SS3 for the fight.

If it is a total stomp, well, I can't think of a good thing that would help Vegeta that is also in the DB universe at the moment.

Edit: how do I add a flair or whatever for frequently used characters,  because I know these two see a lot of time on this thread (not necessarily against each other though) 




 HULK STOMP!! 




 I was going to post some complaints from my employer here, but compared to everyone else, mine is actually wonderful. We make everything from scratch, and people can even watch us make our products. My only complaint is that we are understaffed for the amount of business we see.

Context: I work in a pretzel shop (Ben's) in North-Central Indiana. 




 Alucard. One of the few stomp cards I dislike playing, for the most part.

He stomps rounds 1-5 easy enough, because if you kill him, he just comes right back. 
No wait, include round 6...He shoots Jake and eats Finn.
Round 7- The Lich: I give this to Alucard 7/10, depending on whether he unlocks control level 0, or he stays at control level 1.

For those who don't know: level 0 us basically where he unleashes the army comprised of everyone he has ever killed/consumed. 




 r/whowouldcirclejerk would probably say Batman, given enough prep time 




 Round 2: Dudley loses an ear. 




 What kind of style does Dudley have? I know Balrog was modified and based on Mike Tyson, so there is that 




 Ash Ketchum hasn't accomplished anything be wanted to do that he said he would do when he left Pallet Town. And he would likely be good leaning, but not be that efficient because nothing he ever does seems to make the villains of his world really go away 




 Any of the last three characters I selected in Marvel vs Capcom 3, so Deadpool, Wolverine, or Virgil 




 Definitely Pol Pit here 




 Thanks for that! 




 This sounds like a bakery I heard about in California, where they specifically employ felons and former gang members. I can't think of the name of said bakery right now though.  




 Did someone say gold? 




 I'm asking because I was wondering if I was the only fraternity member (Phi Kappa Tau) who noticed that members of his chapter talk about topics that seem off from the fraternity stereotype. The main things I've noticed are that I can get away with talking about anime when I want, and there is a huge circle jerk for Doctor Who (gotta spell out that Doctor part though). 









 I want to gild you, but I can't. 




 From what I understand, Deadpool is basically immortal. He may not be able to defeat everyone in 6 hours,  but, given the style of his comics, he would break 4th wall before being erased, and the audience wouldn't let him be erased. 
Also, I wouldn't take me seriously the moment I start mentioning Deadpool without good explanations.  




 If it turns out to be Captain America, grab an enemy of the Avengers (probably Ultron) the end. 

If it isn't Captain America, then my appeal is going out to Goku, because he always seems to give the benefit of the doubt and second chances out the ass, so what would be the odds of him ignoring me at this point in time, as a citizen who needs help turning over a corrupt system?

Also, I'd play reverse psychology on any villain I could. It is underhanded, but hey, we can't all be the saints of tomorrow. 




 Deadpool because Deadpool. Haters gonna hate 




 South Park Mickey Mouse stomps! Seriously,  he would view Capone as someone who is in the way of him making money, so he would dispose of him like the rest of the Disney could stars. 10/10 




 Johnson does at least 45 minutes- an hour of cardio several days each week, so that isn't too big of an issue. The issue for me is that a 3v1 turns into a stomp for the 3 in this situation. How about Johnson runs a gauntlet against them in order, and he is allowed an hour's rest in between each fight?

Edits: I changed "bug" to "big" 




 1. Batman can learn the situation and everything a lot easier than Barney so yeah...Batman wins round 1.

2. Barney would obviously be funnier, given his track record when it comes to dealing with criminals and whatnot.

3. How fucked is Gotham? Very. There is no way Fife can deal with any level of criminal if he isn't hardly able to deal with the people of Mayberry doing little things here and there. He would be a comedy character in a not so comedic world.

4. There would be no crime in Mayberry because Batman would either have everyone locked up, or he would have struck fear into their hearts. For a recall election,  that would likely never happen seeing how the master detective can deduce the situation (see #1) easily enough to win the affection of Mayberry and its citizens.
 




 Includes cat. Gets karma... 




 Definitely weed on the left side.  




 So, Cap would still have all of his combat training and muscular structure,  but he wouldn't have the shield,  correct? 




 Definitely Saitama going God status time!! 




 Do you count the super serum (iirc) as a power? I mean, it is technically a chemical he is exposed to, but it's kinda blurry for me on whether the serum counts as a power 




 This is likely true for me as well, since he is more than many levels smarter than most people my age (20) at 14 




 Time traveler kills Batman before he is born. Time traveler kills his parents. Time traveler kills infant batman. Time traveler kills 10 year batman. Time traveler kills 14 year old batman. 

Point is, this needs more specific details. Because time traveler goes back In time and kills batman before he becomes a threat to anything.

 I have two answers for this. 
Keeping in the same universe, I wanted to see the actual conclusion to the Majin Vegeta/SS2 Goku, not the plot device involving Majin Buu.

From different universes, I want to see Korra (after connecting to the spirits of past Avatars) fight someone like Picollo (post-Nail, pre-Kami for balance purposes)

Yes, I am going to be the guy who likes DBZ hypotheticals, but realizes that there are more characters in the series than Goku.

 Do any of the Furian (sp?) Powers from the Riddick universe break physics? I honestly don't remember too much of it not being able to have some kind of semi plausible explanation 




 Bender would get too lazy to fight,  more than likely. Remember that he isn't motivated go do much of anything,  unless it is for him. 

The Joker could probably use Bender's alcohol dependency to lure him into some kind of trap related to vaporizing Bender or making robots obsolete. 

Overall, I would say Bender at 7.5/10 because he would recognize when he is being conned, and he is also a frickin robot, so he would likely use any of the million or so things he's pulled out of his body/ass to kill the Joker.

Thought: in the episode of Futurama where the electromagnetic cosmic abnormality opens, Bender literally shits bricks as an act of fear. So he could be scared, shit bricks, and then kill Joker with those. 

Crime: They'd probably rob a super sized bank, and then Joker would burn the money because he is fuckin insane. 




 Question: is Superman Prime allowed? Because if so, throw everything out of the window, Prime will just rewrite the entire scenario to make himself because he is a dick slinging Superman like that 




 Probably Atom Ant. He would likely become molecularly unstable (my guess) due to the sheer size increase, and he also would not be able to avoid detection in any situation that his ant size is considered favorable. While he would still retain his super speed, flight, and super strength, he would lose that stealth factor that I mentioned earlier in this post.

Tl; Dr: Atom Ant doesn't get to be sneaky 




 I see the Neo Tri - Beam being brought up as Tien's only hope, but the problem with that would be that more than likely, Frieza would survive, if even a little, and recover before Tien would be able to defend himself again due to the toll on his body, resulting in Frieza walking to Tien's body and finishing him, Mortal Kombat style, because fuck that guy for challenging the former supreme ruler of the known universe, Lord Frieza. 




 There are so many re rolls happening right now, just on the sheer account of feeling too godly in the first fight. Example: Nanite Reality,  aka, Reality Warping. Not fair at all in my honest opinion

 I've been listening to some of my older music, which is mostly music from certain artists earlier in their career, alongside some of their modern stuff, and I've noticed that it almost seems like the talent is gone, or they just don't sound as good.

 I can understand how they would together (one can believe in a higher power that helps them feel comfort in their insecurities, and at the same time, be used as an exaplanatory gap for things science hasn't yet confirmed/refuted, and be able to practice science properly) I used to think that science and religion had to be separate, especially with the theory of evolution/Creationism, but I have seen, since about 2 years ago, that science and religion can coexist, until one starts interfering with the exercise of the other (Ken Ham's Young Earth Creationism/ atheists who believe that religion being around science will stupify the minds involved) 




 People who use bad gym etiquette; examples range from not cleaning up after oneself, or just standing around talking in an area where I need to be for an exercise, such as people who gather either around a set of dumbbells I would like to use or all around the squat rack.

 So I head into Meps this Wednesday and Thursday,  but I know I will be put on a DEP because of my braces, so the earliest I could go to basic would be late February - early March. My main questions are:

How much of what my recruiters push is complete bullshit (they aren't focused on me getting an education, but rather they keep trying to push the possible high salary that can come with being a nuclear engineer?

 "Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora!"

That is the cry of Star Platinum trying as hard as he can to protect Jotaro from the swarm. I want to believe that with the power of precise movements and the urges of Stand master preservation,  Star Platinum would fend off all the bees, but I do not think he could move fast enough to protect Jotaro from a swarm of the bees stinging him. Maybe they could do the heart stop thing to prevent blood flow so the venom doesn't circulate while it gets separated from the blood cells and removed from the body,  but I doubt that would even work.

 Generally, the chapters that haze are becoming more and more of the minority amongst Greek Life as a whole. Honestly, there are other ways of building the bonds between members that will last a lifetime. Personally, spending time around all of my fellow brothers doing things like catching dinner or even hanging out playing Xbox (not stereotypical CoD or sports) makes me feel like we are all connected beyond our memberships in our respective chapters. 

I do not have any hazing experiences myself, as I'm not big on hazing people, and there wasn't really any type of initiation requirement or anything of that sort that could be considered hazing, within the wordings of both public perception and our National Fraternal Constitution.

 Alucard (Hellsing) vs Wolverine (Marvel)

1. In character, both of them would likely fight, since Wolverine as a mutant would likely be someone Alucard would hunt. I feel like most rounds would be a contest of Alucard's souls vs Wolverine's healing factor. I would give the victory to Alucard's souls and vamperic powers. Alucard 6.5/10

2. Bloodlusted: if Wolverine can chop off Alucard's head and rip out his heart on a speedblitz, then Wolverine would win (odds are about 4/10, IMO) More than likely, Alucard would go level 0 and Wolverine's healing factor would not be able to keep up with the sheer amount of injuries he would suffer. Alucard 6/10.

3. Prep: Wolverine would know what to do to actually kill Alucard, and Alucard would know how to beat adamantium skeletons and healing factor, but I would give this to Wolverine 6/10, because I think prep helps Wolverine more than it would Alucard

 I lived in Missouri, but am now in Indiana.

For Missouri,  we would just smoke a bunch of meth and go berserk.

 That was my exact reference.  




 Adam West portrayed Batman in the 1960s 





























 As the titles implies,  I made an agreement with a friend. Basically, he is not going to drink for a month if I don't smoke for a month. I made a joke in a conversation and now this is a serious thing. 




 The character customization in Tactics was really enioyable 




 Holy -expletive- the music is gripping and beautiful. Is it an original production or taken from a classical piece

 Give Goku Batman's preptime abilities and overall intelligence. That would be a fun what if, like what if Goku suddenly has an IQ of 1000 and can come up with better plans than "we need to hit this thing really hard"

Edit: he could beat Superman in that chili cook off posted earlier 




 This is a matter of preptime. I've heard and seen they are both ridiculous at it (beware of circle jerkers). 

Round 1: both get a week of preptime to figure out how to appease the hunger of Galactus.

Round 2: both get 6 months to figure out how to take down a higher tiered member of a different universe. (Loki vs Superman, Batman vs Thor)

Round 3: both get 5 years to prepare a contingency for something that they should not/cannot do by themselves. Situations are Loki vs Darkseid and Batman vs Thanos.

Bonus 1: The two fight to incap, no prep. (Bats doesn't kill in character)

Bonus 2: one month prep, fight to kill (bloodlusted)

 I don't get any rashes or such. I usually just sneeze if there is too much smoke around,  so it could just be that 




 *you're 
And does that actually make a difference? 
Also sorry I'm an asshole 




 It seems ridiculous, but almost every time I smoke, I start sneezing and getting watery eyes (like allergies, not the natural bloodshot). I would think that you could since you could technically be allergic to anything since it depends on the body's reaction (despite most of the wonderful highs I've had over the years)

 Anecdotal evidence follows: 
Marijuana can provide a psychological dependence, rather than a physical one (like, you will mentally crave it rather than physically) and this can be just as addictive and difficult to break as a physical dependence. One of the biggest signs to determine if someone is addicted to marijuana is to check their spending habits. If they are sacrificing necessities for weed, then you have an addict on your hands. 

Hell, anything can become an addiction if it fucks up the rest of your life enough  




 People always give me shit for casually smoking mids  (I break out dank for get togethers  and special occasions) 
The way I look at it I may have to smoke a little more, but I get a half of mids for the same price I get an eighth of dank.

 Alcohol: I hold conversations like a normal person when buzzed (not drunk). Drunk me is fun though.

Weed: This world is too serious, sometimes. I unwind after the competition and rush of everyday life. 

Benzos: Rare, but usually only when I need something done or my social retardation goes into overdrive.

Psychedelics: I like to see things from a different point of view, especially when it is something through my own senses.

Mdma: When I want to party and enjoy myself, but I don't want to drink. Better than alcohol honestly, just less socially acceptable.

Snoop Dogg: creates peaceful hip hop, moves to reggae, smoking weed the whole time. Then, he develops edgier music that culminates into songs about smoking, and a general disregard for the law. Point: dudes still smoking weed either way.

Behemoth: multiple lineup changes, lead singer gets and ungets leukemia, and the music is still metal as fuck either way. Mostly the same back and forth for me.

 It's a comfort thing personally. Most people shouldn't be dicks about it, but for those who are, you might have to talk your way through it. Personally, every one who I do MDMA, or Molly even, around knows I do so they aren't too worried about it 




 He would be my ace over basically every other ace in existence. 




 Not feeling the bar so I decided to come home and put on some music . 




 My friends always seem to pull me aside whenever my pupils are dilated.  




 How's it treating you right now 




 Eyes are some of the most fascinating looking things around. My only complaint is that every substance I do or take seems to alter them, and make them a clear giveaway that "I'm on something.' I love the look of my eyes when i'm on certain substances,  but I wish I could find things to do that either wouldn't make my eyes extremely bloodshot or make my pupils dilate to the size of dimes.

Marijuana = bloodshot, 'lowered' eyes 
MDMA/Molly/MDA = Dilated eyes
25i/25c = Dilated eyes
Cocaine = Dilated eyes
Alcohol = I don't look at my eyes when I'm  drunk.
LSD = Dilated Eyes
Adderall = Dilated eyes
Benzos = I don't fuck with em much. I have an addictive personality. 




 One is an extreme anti drug hypocrite who would ruin it, and the other would likely either try to get me fired from my job or ruin my social life  




 Dude I know the feeling. I'm going to a decent get together this weekend (about 50 people) and I'm avoiding acid strictly because of two people who I refuse to trip around 




 Would that festival happen to be Coachella? 




 If I could teach them how to ride a high, or get them to take a tolerance break, then they wouldn't need as much weed. I took a 2 week break (went from almost an eighth a day to 2 hits) and the high honestly felt more genuine for me 




 Yea but it's kinda my fault for being irresponsible with my smoke and finances in the past 




 Life only has as much value as you want it to have, and most people aren't going to care what you do one way or another 




 I know OP in real life. Some of our other friends were wanting to see if I wanted to buy weed for me so they could smoke it. OP and the girl did their own thing, and I had another friend come pick me up. 

Edit: the plan we for me to buy an eighth and then smoke them out. Knowing these guys, they would smoke the whole eighth, and I don't exactly have $50 a night to drop 




 I use the term safeties, others use the term trip sitters. Basically to make sure you don't freak out or put yourself or others in harm's way 




 Context: I tripped with a couple of friends last night, but I left because some others in the group were trying to get me to buy weed so they could smoke it. I had another friend come pick me up to be my safety. I couldn't explain to him what kind of vibe I was looking for (words were hard) and he tried his hardest to set up a good vibe. So I wound up watching Deadman Wonderland and taking breaks to look into the mirror. Basically, I had an awesome trip, but but I wish I could let people know how to be the best safeties they can be.

Edit: Safeties = Trip Sitters  




 I'm glad you enjoyed your night bro. Sorry I had to split. I started getting a peer pressure vibe off the guys to buy weed.  




 An eighth of weed, 2 mg Xanax, and 800 micrograms of 25i. Does that sound like a good idea?

 My shift in friends showed me this actually. Some people used to compete to see who would stay in the circle the longest. Now, with my current friends, we can smoke a joint between 4 or 5 people and all be functional. Might be the difference between being a functional stoner and being a couch lock stoner 




 I have friends who will smoke blunt after blunt after bowl after joint. They'll all get high but no one wants to be the first guy out. I must be the weirdo because I catch my buzz, acknowledge I'm good, and go about my day. It's the difference between a stoner with a routine and ambition and one who would rather smoke as much as they can and tell stories about it 




 I'm glad I can measure out each hour of my high based on how many 1 hitters I want to pack. 




 Tl:Dr. Alcoholic friend lectures me on doing coke once, fails to see hypocrisy in choices.

So last night, I went to hang out with some friends I hadn't seen in a while  (I transferred colleges). One of them had caught wind that I did coke within the past week, and gave me a huge lecture on how I'm not on the right path, how my life will be ruined, and all that jazz. I'm just venting a bit because I did it once (no redose, no urge to do it again) yet my friend is an alcoholic who will be drunk almost every day of the week  (they have about 20 empty handles of Fireball whiskey on display in their kitchen). One friend won't even acknowledge my presence anywhere anymore, and the third guy is cool, and knows I actually have my shit together. So yea, I hate word of mouth and the warped views of addiction people have. Yes, drugs can ruin your life. No, I don't believe you can be hooked on substances after one use.

Said friend is like "yeah, I chew, I drink, I even smoke pot on occassion, but that hard shit will ruin your life." Well, at least this friend has stopped being anti-marijuana

Edit: Removed some phrasing that made me come off worse than intended. 

2nd edit: The friend who wasn't acknowledging my presence has been a bit reserved about things lately, and I was told something else was probably on his mind. I feel like an ass. 




 So we needed a study to tell people to not be total dicks about someone's weight to their face? 




 Dumb bitch deserved that 




 MDMA makes it hard for me to be social because an overexcited, mildly off putting, really loud, 6'4" 240 lb. male is kind of hard for people to deal with. One time, I went out to a club to go dance. Instead, I talked to people as they were coming in by the cover charge place (because I don't have a better name for it)

When I trip, I love anime. Something about Asian artwork entices me. The last time I tripped, I finished watching the arc of Hajime No Ippo I was on, and getting caught up on season 3 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 




 I haven't seen as much use out of women personally. Most of them I know tend to just drink with their friends, and maybe a quarter of that group will smoke on occassion. I think it's like 5 or 6, at the most, that I know for a fact they have done something more recreational  (MDMA, LSD, shrooms)
    
Almost every guy I know drinks or smokes. A decent amount have done coke, shrooms, acid, what have you. I can find a guy to be a safety, or to do the substance with me, much easier than I can a woman.
    
Though I have seen more women be around prescription pills than men.

 They're just not my cup of tea. Good on them being successful though 




 Eaten- Bloodbath 




 Fergalicious 




 She will welcome you to New York City with style!! 




 This needs to be a thing  




 I haven't read that one. The way I understood it was that he either couldn't get drunk or it took a lot because of his Asgardian physiology  




 I still work across from one. Sometimes their music seeps across, past the phone kiosk in the middle where the ladies working there have a Macbook on loud blaring Drake, past the speakers we have blaring Rush, Led Zeppelin, and other classics, and into my unfortunate ears. 

One girl I know and am friends with will claim that Bring me the Horizon is better than anything I listen to. Sure I've gone through phases of shitty music tastes, but this is worse than what I used to listen to. I will list my musical experiences in a different comment if anyone is interested, so they can see my frame of reference.

That last paragraph was intended to sound incredibly pretentious.  




 I feel like you look like James Spader in your present photo 




 Ents get wildfire thrown at them. 420 blaze it  




 Much comment 




 Can Thor even get drunk?

But for real; the only enhancement I have seen that would even matter is having Cap's  shield to possibly block Mjolnir's strikes. Otherwise I'm feeling all levels of a Thor stomp, simply because of the tier system alone 




 How do you combat telepathic octopi martial arts 




 Beating a dead horse  




 Hey Mom, can we invest my allowance in Apple?  




 /r/fatpeoplehate would appreciate this  




 How would Superman know to atomize him right off the bat? Does Superman have any abilities that can directly atomize someone, so to speak  




 I posted this in /r/whowouldcirclejerk a little while back actually. Way to take my idea :p 




 Me vs anywhere from 5-10 emperor penguins depending on weight. (Me at 240, penguins anywhere from 50-100)

Round 1: I sharpen my table leg into a sword because thank you small knife in my pocket.    
Round 2: I take the table leg (now unsharpened) start cracking out chunks of ice that I can slapshot into penguins vital organs.
Round 2b: I actually suck at ice sports.   
Round 3: This is the hard round. I lose because I have no knife swing speed in water. 




 Round 1: Base Super Buu.   
Round 2: After absorbing Gotenks and Piccolo.    
Round 3: After absorbing Gohan. 




 Jack 10/10 




 How much gravity would it take (in proportion to Earth's gravity) for Superman to no longer be able to fly?

Scenario 1: Superman under a yellow sun.    Scenario 2: Superman under a red sun.   Scenario 3: Superman under a blue sun. 




 It might not actually be state law (Indiana) but it is a bit of a personal/moral law for me. Sorry for any mix up this caused 




 The theme song from Loiter Squad has never been more relevant 




 Congratulations -Insert correct proper noun here- 




 Much villain. Such evil. Wow. 




 Legal: water during, one half of my multi vitamin before bed, maybe some light food. Ibuprofen, more water and White Castle the day of hangover. I will also take the other half of my multi (it's 2 pills once a day, but if I split it up, my body absorbs the nutrients better)

Illegal: Wake and bake.  




 Yeah I've noticed my appetite does weird things when I smoke frequently or take breaks and such. Like, when I smoke a lot, I'll only be able to eat when I'm high,  but I still won't eat too terribly much. When I'm on break, I won't hardly eat for about 2 or 3 days, then I'll go back to eating about like normal 









 Would've been better with Fry meme 
























 I've met too many women who get offended when I use the term dude toward them even when I'm at an [11] 




 Oh you're good dude (please don't be offended if you're female) 




 That really is adorable. Deal with meth heads who will take refrigerators and copper wire and tools and scrap them for a fix. That is the bad end of the drug world  




 Ah I like the insight and removal from my depressive cycles. The last time I did acid I tried to eat something simple and puked it back up. I decided that unhealthy foods were the enemy and have dropped 20 lbs since that trip (about 2 months ago) 




 I've got a bit of understanding I guess from the fact that my brother loves his occasional meth, frequent spice, and even more frequent weed smoke. I prefer the psychedelics because it let's me go on an adventure within my own mind. He hates psychs because he can't function or do what he wants while he is on them. I guess it is a difference in wanting to control the effects 




 My first time being high I was baked for about 4 hours and just played Mario Kart the whole time. You will have a longer duration due to the fact that the receptors in your brain that are affected by THC have had zero training to deal with it 




 I have the luxury of having a light school and work schedule so I can take the day or 2 it takes to adjust my sleep cycle to complete sobriety.  




 I'm planning on getting my degree in Psychology then getting my MBA so I can move into HR management. Then I will be able to help find the good candidates who may otherwise fail drug tests and try to be understanding toward that to the fullest of my ability 




 Loving the vibes. What genre is it if I may ask? I haven't started up Spotify yet  




 I'm pro education and harm reduction. I try to help those around me. But if you put anything that you do on social media, then that is your dumb fault for doing so and all consequences are to be expected, unfortunately. Sorry if that came out a little crude 




 I didn't know which sub to put this in but I need some help. I'm trying to form a Playlist so I have good music to listen to while I roll (MDMA) 

I'm sorry if this isn't helpful, but I prefer most genres except for pop twang (that modern country "music" stuff) 

Starting artists include:
Beck
Run the Jewels
Gojira
Kanye West
Jay Z
Datsik 
Skrillex

Edit; I am listening to every suggestion that is posted and I'm enjoying most of them 




 Run the Jewels 2 




 I reuse almost any food container I get for storing other things. You just have to give it a good soak, wash, and rinse first 




 This is assuming all powers available and at max upgrades, all guns maxed out, the whole 9 yards.

Round 1: Is there anyone who can enter the simulated world and beat him, or is he like TOAA?   

Round 2: Outside the simulation and in powersuit.

I chose to not include a non powersuit, outside of simulation round because he is a regular human with guns otherwise.

Bonus: Would there be a tier change if followers were added?

Edit: Added in actual rounds and clarification 




 The fact that there is a sign means that someone has done this before 




 Straight up fight.   
Round 1: in character.    
Round 2: bloodlusted.     

If this is a stomp for either side, adjust accordingly. 




 It's still fucking ugly anyway and the dumb bitch didn't know how to set her brightness or saturation up properly before uploading said dress photo.  




 Not even an Ent? 




 Pokemon  




 I actually like most of the songs on this list.  




 Jokes on them: I actually like most of the songs on lists like these  




 My depression is usually brought on by either long term smoking or eating a bunch of junk. Because I can smoke out one night, and feel like crap the next day.  




 The last time I did shrooms, I sat around and laughed at most everything for about 5 hours. 




 I've been looking forward to this since I finished high school  ('12) and it's finally happening. If I don't find some friends to split the PPV cost with, I'll wind up going to the bar 




 Weed puts me in a depressive funk.    
LSD makes me appreciative of being alive,  despite the issues I've had while tripping.   
Shrooms chill me out.   
Cocaine makes me want to fight and be on edge.   
Opiates make me sleepy and about knock me out.  




 As another responder said, you might want to consider moving. Seriously,  I'd rather hear about someone getting help from marijuana than being funneled into Big Pharma, and stuck in  a loop of using overly addictive pain killers 




 Superman rips off S on outfir, reveals Bat.

Batman 10/10 




 Mewtwo mind controls someone to pray that he has the strength to defeat Giygas. Giygas is so weakened by this that he dies out, leaving Mewtwo free to psychic blast Porky to Hell. gg Earthbound  




 An f16 pilot is given his orders to bomb a new terror threat. However, the pilot gets lost on his way there, and blows up the octagon, killing both of them. 10/10 America. The pilot is also awarded the Medal of Honor for his valorous service and contribution to the well-being of the United States.

Bonus: Satan is now super Pissed since he has to deal with both Coulter and Grace in Hell and their voices and opinion delivery methods are far greater torture than anything he or Hell can conceive.  




 ARE YOU A FUCKING TRUCK? 




 This looks like something a friend of mine from high schools grandparents were doing. 




 Thank you for the database link mod 









 I donate to MAPS myself because they are an organization I would love to work with after school, and I believe in their cause. Also, as another responder pointed out,  everyone has their charity they believe in 




 People who play the victim when, in reality, they are the aggressor 




 Why is Comic Sans so hated?  




 Also, the NFL has Chandler Jones, the brother of UFC fighter Jon "Bones" Jones, who claims that he used to be able to beat his brother in fights 




 Depends on the toonforce in use while Spongebob and them get set  




 "Was that my left bicep? No! That was my aaaaabbbbdominals!!"

Terry Crews 10/10 




 Darkseid when he jobs 




 Japan with robots.  
U.S. with standard military force.    
Russia with Vladimir Putin 




 It was a Starbuzz Blueberry I think. On a Starbuzz hookah with a decent lotus. I got it to pack well, but I might have packed it where the coals got too hot 




 Pikachu and Snorlax. Biggie Smalls. There are so many names for them 




 Weston  is somewhat based in the real world, and Archer is super unrealistic about most details, so I'd give it Archer for that reason alone  




 I loved Anubis just for the sake that he can command anyone based on who touches his sword. Yes they showed that Jotaro and Polnaredd dealt with the stand in one or two episodes  




 Did not need a mod, despite the fact you were who I was looking for on another trip thread. Mitigating my come down with Hookah and Dr. Pepper 




 Both types fuck with your mind. I was addicted to earlier and am hooked on hookah. You know what you personally want, based on chemical 




 Or any one of the other mods  




 I figured it would be /u/roi_on_steroids to comfort me lol 




 Found someone else who couldn't.  Gonna check bowl and check them 




 I've never had a complaint whilst smoking them. The smoke I've had doesn't burn me  hard, but I'm not exactly experience  









 Work. Hookah.  Sober. Otherwise this is a fun chill sing to smoke too 




 Because he was one of the artists hyped during Coachella time but it's been a while since I tuned into that scene  




 Good reply lol  




 Is it weird that I started liking Tame Impala because of Tyler the Creator?  




 Brooklyn Nine Nine is bad on this because it's always Fox commercials 




 My old DS charger used to take 2 spots. Pissed myself 




 BLACK 




 Power by Kanye West  




 If you could move out west after very getting you're degrees, MAPS had some postings on their websites but you have to be in Santa Cruz to be considered  




 The last time I did psyches, I was so overloaded with thoughts where I couldn't discern one from another. It might be different for others 




 I'd say take 1 of the percs at most. Just want to make sure nothing bad happens to you 




 I may not be part of the norm, but you are describing my nights with people and drugs. Like I want to counsel and part themselves but it's hard since I have what I love. I've cut back to get a new job and unless at least until I get the degree so I can hold my degree of empathy without comprising my degree of realatability without looking like a hypocrite.  




 Beer with hookah bowls. Hand-mixed drinks otherwise 




 Upvote for the weirdness 




 Congrats on the perfect game! As well as the clean series. Way to close those frames! 




 Like I keep mine propped up to keep everything else open. I can run an emulator and Spotify without any lag anymore 




 God bless foreplay. It's helped me through so many situations,  and I'm glad to hear it from someone else, even if it's an online anon  




 Cocaine. Done it a few times. Always want to beat the fuck out of someone around me 




 In a different way. I felt myself dissociated and as if I had multiple personalities the last time I tripped. I really felt like I learned a lot both about myself and my relation with others through the experience 




 Oh good point. Did not think I would have to state that sex was consensual 




 I have been drugged, thus I can survive being drugged.   
I have been shot, thus I am immune to most small arms.    
I have had sex before, thus I am a master of seduction.     
I have been tazed and wasn't injured, so I am now immune to being electrocuted.   

I'm pretty much a better James Bond at this point. I figure someone will disapprove of at least one of these.  




 Pugs on drugs? 




 The way my friend explained it was that he could only find the whole setup on a German website. 









 I! AM! GROOT!!! 




 [Final Fantasy 7]

Sonoportation  (Teleportation by sound)   

Enhancement Calling (physically powering myself or others up)   

Selective Elimination (Making others think someone is dead or removed from existence when they are really there)   

Results: hear footsteps, teleport behind target, cut jugular vein/enhance myself to plunge giant knife through brains, rinse and repeat for every person in the universe, using selective elimination to remove myself from perceptible existence as needed so no one knows it is me
 




 [Saints Row IV]   
[Mind Reading, Real World Enforcement, Organic Wing Generation]

Sir, I broke your simulator. Will roll again for game before this one. 




 OandS have this, I'm pretty sure 6/10. Remember,  if one of them dies, the other gets a massive boost and increased elemental powers (Ornstein's being in lightning and Smough's being in fire) 




 Forgetting this exists. Also, vanishing/wandering off 




 I wandered off 




 I just sort of wondered off, Towelie style 




 It's not like it was Peeta  bread 




 Squawk 




 It was some generic wheat bread. Not bad but stale. 0/10 when sober 




 Well, I got super hungry, and the bread was being thrown at me. Me, being incredibly lazy, decided not to get up to get actual food but to eat bread being thrown at me 




 I went full pigeon. Never go full pigeon  




 And the N word 




 Are you lying? 




 Kpins take longer to onset. But with things like it, I wouldn't recommend drinking with it. Too easy to black out.  




 Just another day in the life of a pretentious artist 




 Lines of coke and molly at the same time. Kills the roll, absolutely stupid, but I smoked and drank enough to do it. Had 4mg Xanax as well. Ended up sleeping tied to a tree, was not arrested or anything. Lost my whole weekend starting from Thursday 




 Blue Moon Winter Ale weird enough. Even though I wind up drinking Miller products because I'm a poor fuck 




 /r/tripsit can be helpful sometimes  




 I'm candyflipping with a friend when she gets back in town, so it should be a fun holiday 




 What is everyone's drug plans for the holiday? Mostly for those who don't have dates I guess because I figured most of the couples would either be sober or smoking weed/rolling on MDMA. 




 I love the TPB reference in the story 




 You, sir or madam, have a beautiful mind 




 Can you provide a link? 




 No. You weren't.  




 This winter has been my worst on cardio in a while. When I was in high school, I had sports, so cardio wasn't something I needed to conciously seek. I always had a gym buddy who would help talk me through actually getting on a treadmill or eliptical (I hate stationary cardio) and now that he moved further north, I've been slacking on cardio. I want to be able to run outside instead (easier on my knees) but whenever the average daily temperature is less than 20 degrees Fahrenheit, it gets too cold to run  




 My Dad and I will usually watch PTI almost every night because the commentary is sensible and they cover more in half an hour (technically, 22 minutes) than most other shows will in an hour or more 




 KLK?
