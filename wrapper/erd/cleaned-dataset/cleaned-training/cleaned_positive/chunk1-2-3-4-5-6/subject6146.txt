 Years ago I found a video online by accident and I've never been able to find it again. Here's what I remember:

-I believe the salesman was a cat of some unnatural color? He was wearing a top hat and suit and I think a monocle as well.

-He was selling to a girl. She gives him a small amount of money and he gives her a sentence, something along the lines of "the purple cat is mooing" but I've tried searching that, it's gotten me nowhere. I remember "mooing" was kind of drawn out. 

-She complains about the sentence. "What, that's it?" or something. He points out that she didn't give him much money, so she hands over some more. At this point the real abstract stuff starts. I can't remember it exactly but I remember thinking it was very strange.

-I think at the end it ended up back at where they started, everything normal, and the girl is surprised and amazed if I recall.

This was quite a long time ago now, it might have been when I was about 14-15, so 10 years ago. I may have been a bit older, but it couldn't have been much more. 




 To be honest, the DM has tried that. He'll start talking like okay, we're going to continue now, and while I generally realize, oh, it's time to stop talking and concentrate, the other two tend to... Not realize and keep talking. Sometimes he'll repeat a few words three times before they finally stop talking.

The best thing I can think of would be to sit down with everyone and talk about the issue. So far, we've just been sort of communicating about the issue over text and while others are not around, but I'm still not sure what would happen. 




 I'm guilty of it too, unfortunately. I'm not the worst offender, but I'm certainly one of them. Talking off topic and getting sidetracked is a huge problem in my group, though. I swear, we could get more done in a game, or finish a game faster, if everyone could concentrate.

The DM made a rule that conversation can only have one degree of separation (and presumably has to be kept as short as possible), but it didn't seem to help much. We also tried writing thoughts down on a note card and talking about them later, but that didn't do much good either. I can tell that the quieter members of the group that want to concentrate on the game are getting annoyed. Hell, I'm getting annoyed and I'm one of the worst offenders.

I want to concentrate on the game. I do! But there are three very talkative girls in our group (myself included) and everything reminds us of some dumb story that we absolutely have to share or something.

Anyway, I'm looking for advice. I'm not the DM, but we've talked about how to control it in the past. I would like some tips on what we can do to keep the chatter down. We don't get to play often (we played tonight, and the previous game was 4/22) because of conflicting schedules, and we can usually only play for a few hours at a time, so making the most of that time would be awesome, instead of spending 25% of it talking about nothing. 




 I'm sorry, but this is kind of awful. People who have depression or are suicidal might actually want to WANT to do these things, but they do not have any energy. I know that when I'm suicidal, I can barely brush my teeth, let alone leave the house and go on an adventure...

Another thing is that people who are suicidal do care. I know there are people that love and I care about them, too. Sometimes they are the only reason I haven't offed myself yet. So the fact that they imply that suicidal people don't give a fuck about others is kind of hurtful. I'm not saying it's true for everyone, of course.

Whenever I see this image (which is far too many times), I think that the person who agrees with it doesn't really understand how depression works. The person who wrote it definitely doesn't. 









 Bacon is exactly why I am not still a vegetarian. That tofu bacon or whatever is just not the same, I don't care what anyone says. You might think it tastes okay, but if you think it tastes like real bacon, you clearly have not had real bacon in a very long time. 









 I'm going to kill myself. Not today, or tomorrow, or probably anytime soon. I just know that I am at some point in the future. It's something I live with every day, I think at the back of my mind, no matter what my mood is, "One day I'm going to take my own life."

I'm not sad or depressed right now. I'm actually rather content right this minute. It won't last though. I know it won't. It never does. It might last another ten minutes, it might last another ten days, but either way, I'll end up at rock bottom again.

I've lived with depression for too long. I started showing symptoms when I was six years old. I was officially diagnosed when I was eight. Two years ago, I was also diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.

I'm 24 years old. I'm overweight. I have basically no friends. I have no job, I'm not going to school. I live with my mother and brother, neither of whom can stand to be around me. I can't even try to have a simple conversation with one of them without it turning into a conversation about what I do wrong.

I'm not the most important person to anyone I care about. I'm completely unremarkable in ever way. I contribute nothing to society. There's no reason for me to really keep going.

I'm not sure why I'm telling this to reddit, to be honest. I just felt like someone should know. Even if only one person sees this. I can't tell the people I care about. I've tried in the past. They either have no idea what to do or, in my mother's case, force me to admit myself to the psychiatric hospital. Going there has only given me a safe place to be until I no longer have the immediate urge to off myself. It doesn't fix problems in the long run. Maybe for some people. Not for me.

I'm just a lonely, depressed girl. One of millions. The world is not necessarily better off without me, but it's not better off with me, either. 




 I thought the picture said "saliva" and wondered why the hell you would do something like that. I had to read the comments to realize what was going on. 




 I just came here to say that Fifth Age Taric is pretty much my favorite skin in the entire game and is the sole reason I play Taric at all. 




 Thank you! I'm looking at it now, but I'm unsure of which codes are the ones I should be posting? Is it the bug check code? 




 Basically my computer is just constantly crashing and restarting. It can stay on for about 30 seconds to five minutes before shutting down. I have an HP desktop, Vista 32-bit. It's had two upgrades in it's entire life: I swapped a 1gb stick of ram that it came with for a 2gb stick (this was about three years ago now) and I recently upgraded the video card (that was two months ago). I had been getting one blue screen before the upgrade of the video card, but also was having a lot of other issues, so I ended up reformatting my computer entirely. I'm getting the same blue screen, along with others now:

-IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

-MEMORY_MANAGEMENT

-PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA

-A blank one with no error messages at all

The page_fault one has listed three files with it at different points: NTFS.sys, win32k.sys and CLASSPNP.sys

I am at the end of my rope. I can't afford a new computer but I really can't be without one either. 




 Ohh, heh. I thought it was weird that both my friend and I had the same thing! We level together and normally stay pretty close in % xp but this was ridiculous!

I was still kind of miffed that I couldn't go kill ONE THING to level though, haha. 









 I was using my laptop, everything was normal, then it shut off suddenly and would not turn on again. It wasn't abnormally hot, neither was the AC adapter. The green light on the adapter was off. I unplugged everything, and plugged the adapter back in to the wall, the green light came back on. Then I plugged it into my computer, and it turned off again.

I tried the trick where you take the battery out and hold down the power button. Nothing changes. I also took the battery out and tried to run it on just the AC adapter, but the same problem came up.

This actually happened a few months ago, I've been using my back up computer since then, so I don't remember absolutely everything that happened. My backup computer is having a lot of issues now so I'd like to get my laptop working again if possible. I bought the laptop in May of 2010, it stopped working in July of 2011. I did use it a LOT but shut it down when I wasn't using it for long periods.

I took it back to where I bought it but they won't fix it for free because it has a messed up USB port. The port had been messed up for a while (not sure when it happened, but I noticed it before all this happened and had stopped using it) so I don't think it's related, but I couldn't afford to fix it.

Thank you for any help you can provide! 




 I don't actually know who the girl on the right is... But, to be fair, I can't identify all the people on the left either. 




 Yes yes yes yes yes. I discovered it when I was visiting my friend in another state and she let me on her computer while she was at work. I had no idea what the game was but I was curious so I clicked on it... She came back 7 hours later and had to use a crowbar to pry me off the computer.

I was never very good, though. It was really common for me to forget to check for problems in the city and only realize it when the whole place was burning down... :( 




 Strawberries. I'm sort of a strawberry creeper at grocery stores. I will pick up a container and just sniff them as hard as I can before putting them back... I don't care who's watching, I'm gonna smell me some damn strawberries! 




 I have such a love/hate relationship with this show. I have seen every episode because I feel the need to keep watching but I get so mad by the end of it. I think I just enjoy being angry at the TV? 




 "I'm blue, da ba dee, da ba die"

I heard it as "I'm blue, I'm in need of a dime."

 In my state (Texas), I believe there's a law saying they can detain you for 24-72 hours once you've said that you are going to kill yourself or something similar.

When I was in the ER after attempting suicide, I was detained before being transferred to a psychiatric hospital. But while I was there, I told one of my nurses that I wasn't interested in getting help and wanted to leave. He told me that basically there was no way in hell they were letting me go. I'm not sure what would have happened if I'd tried to just walk out, but I don't think anything good would have happened. 




 I asked that same question to someone who worked at a hospital. Basically, at least at the hospital she worked at, they make sure you haven't already tried something. If you haven't yet, they keep you there and bring in someone to evaluate your mental health/stability. If they decide you are a threat to yourself, they will keep you until you can be transferred to a psychiatric hospital, where hopefully you can get the help you need. If you have attempted something, they treat you first, then just send you to the psychiatric hospital. 




 As someone who compulsively pulled her hair out, including eyebrows and eyelashes, I can say I definitely enjoy having eyebrows. I looked very weird for a very long time. 




 Unfortunately, these are the best meds for my condition. I have gone through a lot of medicine, and this is what works best, so the first person is right: I am going to have to get serious about working out. I am a little sad that my glasses are being booed. I have adored them since high school, but maybe it is time for a change. I am always willing to try new looks, though! Luckily it's that time of year where I need to upgrade my prescription :) 




 I like this suggestion! Yoga seems like it would do me a lot of good. I did some with a friend one time and I felt very refreshed after. 




 Thank you :) I am a little sad that people didn't like my glasses, because I adore them. But I am not against trying new looks! If I don't like it, I can always change it again! 




 Honestly, I did think of that. Unfortunately, while there are alternatives, they don't work as well for someone with my condition. But as for your second suggestion, the getting serious about working out... Someone below suggested yoga, and I like that. It's relaxing, and toning at the same time :) 




 Okay. I have to know. I'm tired of my friends sugar coating it for me so I'm gonna post here. I know I have very little chin; there's nothing I can do about that. I gained weight because of a lot of medicine I'm on that I will be taking for, well, the rest of my life, and it's made me extremely self-conscious.

So, that all said, here we go.

 /r/wowtrees is such a good idea because there are so many places in WoW that are fun to be around.

For example, while I am up in the clouds, I love to mine in Deepholm. The colors just trip me out and it's just so much more beautiful. 




 I've recently found myself homeless, along with my cousin. I'm trying to find resources in Austin, Texas that can help us takes steps to getting a place to stay, jobs, etc. Neither of us have an income currently, and we are both completely at a loss for what to do or where to start. Any help is appreciated.

Edit: I should add that I'm female, and my cousin is male. 




 Big Boss. Who doesn't have a crush on him? 
























 How many girls' bedrooms do you see vs guys? Because thinking about it right now, there's a pretty even number of male vs female people in my life who live in extremely messy environments, and same for people being cleaner. 




 Honestly, this is not the first time in my life that I have cleaned my entirely too messy room to this point only to let it get out of control again, but I don't have an income. $10 a month is too much, let alone $100 or even an apartment of my own. I hope that I can keep it clean this time. I know it's early to assume that this is how things are going to be, but just getting my room this clean is a huge success. It'll be an even bigger one if it still looks like this in a month. 




 I've been diagnosed to hell and back with a hundred different things. Only recently have I found a diagnosis and treatment that is actually helping. Depression has been a major one for a long time, but briefly my doctor thought maybe I was bipolar. Last year, I was diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder and have been getting treatment for that, and there's such a difference. I've found meds that work, and therapy that works, and I hope this is the start of the rest of my life. 




 When a guy lives like a pig, it's "why do you live like a pig?"

When a girl lives like a pig, it's "why do girls live like pigs?" 




 Good luck!!!! 




 I get it. I lived in that mess for two or more years. I was too embarrassed to have people in my room, let alone ask them to help me clean it. I just couldn't take it anymore.

If it's too much to ask for help, at least at the point it's at right now, try and clean some of it on your own. Maybe not all in one day, or even two. Just clean one small area and keep that neat, then move on to the next. 




 I could not have done it without the help of my friend. Every time I tried on my own, I would just stare at the mess and get so overwhelmed. I didn't know where to start.

The best advice I can give is to start where you are going to be the most often. I started with my desk, then my bed, and then I just worked my way around my room until finally it was all done. Also, do it in short bursts instead of all at once. We started by doing 20 minutes of cleaning, 10 minutes of break, and by the end, I was able to work for longer and longer. Adjust the amount of time to something you're comfortable with (as long as it's not 5 minutes of cleaning, then break forever) and just remember that having a clean space will make you feel better and is something you can control in your life! 




 I've heard it before in the multitudes of therapies I've been in, but it's worth repeating because it is very true. I am in a better mood when the area I'm in is organized. 




 Thank you. And believe me, there have been pizza boxes and all kinds of gross food things in here. I hope you can find the motivation to clean, too. It helps a lot, having a clean space, even if it's just a clean space to mope in. 




 One of the reasons I got rid of the carpet for the wood floors. So much easier to clean, but damn if dust doesn't build up if you don't keep after it (which obviously, I didn't). 




 I was wondering what part gave it away. Thanks!

(also hell yeah delicious food) 




 I'm not falling for this twice. 




 Are you talking about the ancient TV? Hahaha.

I play N64 games on it because it looks better on that than it does on the huge flatscreen out in the living room. 




 We clearly aren't talking about the same Daniel. 




 Depression has a way of ruining everything in your life. It's not just being sad, it's being apathetic and unmotivated. I have very little energy for basic day-to-day activities and this took a lot out of me. 




 lmao

you know what's really funny??

that's actually something daniel would do 




 I can't stand having a bare room. I love all the stuff I have in my room! The problem is when I start keeping stuff I don't actually love and just can't throw out. 




 holy shit! yeah hey!! it's been a while, damn. i can't believe you remember what my room looks like. 




 my room is clean. who is this though?? 




 Will do! :) 




 This actually really, really does work. I would watch that show, even just commercials of that show, and think, "That's going to be me one day."

Then I decided, no, that is NOT going to be me one day. 




 WHAT THE HELL 




 It took a lot of effort and honestly, a few times, I just wanted to sit down and quit. I was just so tired of living like that, it sucks. I've lived in that mess for far, far too long. I just had to remember how much better I'd feel when it was finally clean, and how much easier it is to upkeep a clean room than it is to clean a room that is this disastrous. It didn't hurt that I had a friend urging me along to keep going and helping me out.

If I can do it, I bet you can do it too!! Just take it one corner at a time! 




 I haven't had time to screw it up again, check back in a week. 




 i got that poster when only the first movie was out okay!! honestly the first one is still enjoyable if you ignore the next however many that came out :P

and thank you!!! 




 hell yeah!!!! 




 Thanks! :) 




 It didn't have doors before, and I can't afford to buy some... then I realized a shower curtain was perfect :) I really like it! I happened to have everything except the curtain rings, which cost $1.  




 Apparently it duplicated some images while uploading. Sorry about that! Don't know what happened.

This took two days and a good friend's help, and I'm so relieved to have space to walk around. And a place to sleep I don't have to be ashamed of! 









 When I was about 14 or 15, I downloaded a song from Kazaa and now I can find no trace of it even existing. I googled the lyrics, nothing useful came up. Everything else I remember is in the title. 














 Basically, I moved out of an apartment back home and somewhere along the way, my favorite set of dice got lost.

Recently though, my car was broken into... I was really upset, they actually stole a pewter DD figurine that I was going to paint and a pair of sunglasses (that was it though... so weird), but when I was going through the car cleaning out the broken glass, I found my old dice and I was so excited I started taking pictures.

So something good came out of something bad :) 
























 I'm a female and I hate this. Some of the women who fight for 'equal rights' just want the good stuff, not any of the bad things. They want equal pay and all that, but they still want the guy to pay for dinner. It pisses me off. Equal means equal, not sorta the same but we still get to walk all over men. 




 I know :( I'm really sad. 




 I'm really looking forward to that thunderstorm, too. 




 I think I know this guy. The guy I know is named Gary, has the same car, and is way too good at DDR... 




 Is it possible to fix it? 




 http://i.imgur.com/QrhmP.png

Every time I restart my computer, any Steam game icon looks like an IE page instead. I can give it a short term fix by manually changing the icon, but it ends up changing back when I restart again. I tried the ClientRegistry.blob trick, and made new desktop icons, but only L4D2 and MTG actually fixed, and when I restarted later, the L4D2 icon was back to the IE icon. Steam is updated, I've verified the integrity and all that.

It's not impairing my ability to play the games at all, but it looks ugly and I hate it. Googling the problem hasn't helped beyond a short term fix. I could just not have icons on my desktop, but I like having them there. As you can see, it only happens with Steam game shortcuts. If I link directly to the game instead of through Steam, it has a normal icon, but then it doesn't play through Steam.

Any help you could offer would be awesome. Thank you. 




 I found out he was a real person when I did one of those "What famous people were born on your birthday?" things and Johnny Appleseed was on the list. 




 I KNEW she looked like someone else. 




 Sept 26? That's me too. 




 yep! I love the Persona series :) Pretty much anything Atlus publishes, I adore. 




 Ugh, people keep commenting on that. It's just fingerprint smudges. I know, don't touch the computer screen, but I do it anyway. They are exaggerated because of the flash on the camera.... 




 It is the same brand. What is 5htp? I am just taking D3 at the suggestion of my doctor. 




 As someone who honestly didn't know how to just "clean my room", basic tips like the ones I gave r2002 were very helpful for me. I can clean a basic mess, but this is a little beyond that. 




 I'm 25. 




 Thank you :) 




 i never thought i'd see mgs ever again 




 No, they're vitamin D3. They are the same brand though! 




 I do have a hamper, actually. It was full of clothing that I didn't want. It was also sitting in the laundry room. I got rid of the clothing, and the hamper is in my closet! 




 Everyone gets depressed occasionally. For someone who doesn't have clinical depression, it's rarely half as severe as those who do have that. Clinical depression invades your life and takes over and it's very easy to let it. It's like this thing that lives on my shoulder and weighs me down, and whispers awful things in my ear that make me want to just curl up in a ball and not do anything. It feeds on my energy and makes even getting out of bed sometimes a huge ordeal. Depression is more than sadness. It's apathy. It makes things that I love uninteresting.

I went a little out of control with my description but basically what I'm trying to say is, depression sucks out all of your energy and motivation. Some people would look at a room that was messy and think, I need to clean this! And then they would clean it. I would look at my messy room and think, this is a disaster and I don't know how to deal with it. Trying to deal with it would overwhelm me. It took someone else's help to get it like this, but it's going to be all on me to keep it like this, and depression is going to fight me every step of the way.

And thank you :) 




 Okay, I didn't know what that was so I looked it up. I'm assuming you mean the vitamin bottle? It's vitamin D3. 




 i'm pretty sure it was yesterday.

also this is the guy who helped me clean my room, and also, i do actually know him. his name is not daniel. 




 No, just asked a friend to help me out. It helped a LOT. 




 BIG whoop de fuckin doo! Try being unmotivated and depressed and getting ANYTHING DONE.

I thought /r/GetMotivated was for people who needed motivation for anything, and wanted to celebrate their achievements that required some kind of motivation. This is mine.  I'm sorry if it's not a huge deal for you. 




 Haha! Yeah! UFYH is awesome!! I got the 20/10s from there and they are a LIFE SAVER 




 Do it!!!! I believe in you!!!!! 




 * Ask for help! I could not have done this without help, seriously.
* Clean in increments. Clean for 20 minutes, take a 10 minute break.
* Clean one spot at a time. Don't look at the whole mess and try to clean it all at once! That is an easy way to get overwhelmed.
* Don't just rearrange the mess. Don't hide it. Bring lots of trash bags and not just for trash. Anything you don't want can go in those to donate! I felt a lot better knowing the shoes I was hoarding weren't just going in the trash, but to someone who might actually wear them.
* Separate things into piles and then deal with the piles. Like with like. Papery stuff, stuff you wear, I had a pile of electronic stuff. Then sort through each pile individually.
* Clean the space you are in the most first. I spend most time at my desk, so I cleaned my desk. 




 It actually uploaded the pictures in the wrong order, and duplicated some? I already posted it over there though, I should have done individual pictures for the text post. 




 Thanks for minimalizing my disorder! You might just be a slob. 




 Yes. It's hard to be motivated to do things like keep a clean environment, and if it's bad enough, even eat, shower, or do any basic day-to-day things that a non-depressed or otherwise "normal" person is able to do without really putting much thought into it.  




 I do have a Ryuk plush. I got him a long time ago, before Death Note was finished. I haven't gone to a con in a couple of years, but I've been to A-Kon, Ikkicon, and Ushicon! 




 I threw out Dream Phone, but damn, Mall Madness is way better. 




 For me, anime and depression do not correlate, so I'm not really sure. I didn't even care about anime until I had been dealing with it for a long time, and I'm not really as into as I used to be. I still really enjoy and love Fullmetal Alchemist, though, so I didn't want to take any of it down. 




 Actually, I got most of my stuff from when the original anime was big and Greedling was barely a thing. I am a HUGE fan of the manga/Brotherhood! 




 Once I got my computer set up again in the corner, I did turn on some music. It helps my mood a lot! 
























 A portion of a tree. 









 I can't stand it when someone has no experience with any sort of self harm or anxiety and says "Well just quit it then." Yeah, okay, how about you quit breathing? 




 Oh, man, I struggled with this when I was younger. I had no eyebrows/eyelashes, and a large bald spot on top of my head. Even when I started treatment, it took about 2 or 3 years before I was finally able to stop completely. I still get urges sometimes, and it's been about 10 years. I'll still catch myself tugging on hair sometimes.

People who knew or noticed what I was doing would sometimes tell me things like, "Your eyelashes won't grow back if you keep pulling them out" (they did grow back, long and thick). Did anyone ever try to get you to stop by saying stuff like that?

Congrats on 5 months!!! 




 It just looks so uncomfortable. 




 My stomach dropped when I opened the picture. 




 I learned how to spell his name by remembering that it's McConey with an AUGH in the middle. 




 I'm sure you and your dad both know what's going on inside the mind of a girl all the time. 




 So basically, I drew this: http://i.imgur.com/NlJz5.png

And I actually liked it well enough that I really wanted to learn how to color digitally on it. And I got this far: http://i.imgur.com/tVrv4.png

I tried looking up tutorials, but I couldn't find any that I liked. I also wouldn't mind any critique in the drawing or coloring itself. Except about the fact that it's not unlined art, because I like the way lined art looks. I am trying to learn unlined as well, but it's more difficult for me. At least I'm getting practice in of both!

I'm using Paint Tool SAI if anyone has any tricks or tips for that program as well. Thank you! 




 Huh! It's been a while since I played, couldn't remember. I'll look some stuff up and figure it out. Thanks :) 




 i'm pretty sure i've not even gotten remotely close. how many floors are there? 




 Right after I posted this, I realized Dungeons of Dredmor might have an ending and I'm just too terrible to get there. Can anyone let me know if I need to reach the end/play 15 hours? 









 My dad yelled at me for trying to start a fire and I cried. 




 That reminds me of the time I decided to try and get my room as dark as possible with a lamp on by layering clothes over the lamp. 




 You should try talking to your friends about doing other stuff. You could say something like, "I know you guys like football, but I'm not as into it." And maybe then you can talk about finding other things to do that you do have in common. It's easy to focus on one thing when a majority of the group can easily discuss the same thing, but when someone's left out, that always sucks. But maybe if you bring up your interests, they would actually enjoy talking about it. Maybe it just hasn't occurred to them since they all already share football as a common topic.

Alternatively, you could try and make friends who do share your interests. I'm not saying abandon your current friends, but try and meet new people! It's not easy, I know it's been really rough for me, but it's worth it. Have you tried looking on meetup.com or something similar? Maybe some forums that pertain to your interests just to have people to talk to at least.

As for the last question: yeah, I do kind of randomly ask those questions. "Do you guys ever just stop and think we're made up of billions and trillions of tiny pieces of matter vibrating constantly?" Crazy stuff. I'd be willing to bet at least one person in your group of friends would enjoy talking about it! 




 I see a lot of negative comments on this, but I like it. Motivation isn't all about losing weight or whatever. Thanks for sharing. 




 IMO, it's not socially acceptable to walk up to a smoker and say that it's unhealthy to smoke. Maybe I'm in the minority, though, I don't smoke so I don't know how often people actually do that. 




 I have the final reward from that quest chain on a Horde character! 




 I think she'd just have a total meltdown and then I'd feel guilty. 




 My grandma will comment loudly about people who don't know how to read when she sees people using the wrong door at Wal-Mart. I don't think anything makes her as angry as seeing someone walk in the exit door. I could break every single teapot she owns and she would be less angry. 




 people who want to be prepared, duh 




 When my dad didn't answer my mom's call one time when we were out of town, I knew something was wrong. Really wrong.

We finally had the neighbor across the street go check on him (she was a nurse), turned out he'd had a seizure and had passed out. He was diagnosed with brain cancer shortly after, and after two years of a downhill battle, he died. 




 I appreciate new followers, but I don't do follow for follow. I want people to follow me because they want to, not because they feel obligated, and I want anyone to feel free to unfollow me for any reason. Also, I want my dash to be mostly things I'm interested in. So if someone follows me, I might check out their blog, but if they have too many posts I don't like/care about, then I won't bother following them. 




 Thank you. I didn't even think about this. I will just try to tough it out.

I am very limited with exercise options because I have a bad back from a bad car wreck. If jogging is bad, then I will just keep walking to stay active. I need more sunlight anyway. Thank you for the information. 




 This is really helpful. I have to stop thinking about the cravings I'm having in the moment and concentrate on getting rid of my flabby belly. I think if I could survive the first week, everything would be so much easier. That's what it was like when I cut sodas out.

One week. That's nothing, right? 




 I wrote a long thing then realized no one would read it so here's a summary:

I get cravings for sweets, and I break my diet after 2-4 days. I can't find a good, sweet thing that can sate these cravings that I don't have to make on my own.

Also, I tried jogging instead of my usual walking routine. I jogged for about 6 minutes (spaced apart so I wouldn't overdo it) and walked for another 20, and ended up sore for three days, to the point where I almost couldn't walk.

So I need some tips on how to sate cravings for things I can't have (foods I can replace them with, or tips on how to just power through it), and tips on how to not be in tremendous pain after jogging. I tried stretching after, I think I did it wrong...

I also struggle with depression, so even having the will power to get up and GO for a walk or jog and stay on a diet for any period of time longer than a day is a big deal for me. I'd just like to keep going so I can punch my depression in the face. Also I'm going to Europe in March and I'd like to be at least 20 pounds lighter before then. 




 It is :)

I used the water tool in Sai. Whenever I use more defined coloring, it always turns out really strange and off to me so I am probably doing something wrong. I will check out some tutorials. Thank you for your comment! 









 I have a hard time picking just one...

Annie in Wonderland

Arcade Sona

Amethyst Ashe (love her purple arrows)

Rugged Garen 




 I thought the Impala had a bench seat in the front, did I get it wrong?

It's cool anyway :) 




 Why is "tampon" censored?  




 My mom is not very motherly at all. She told me that I was too old to need a mother (I was 19), she's called the police on me because I wouldn't go to therapy (she wanted me escorted off the property and I wouldn't leave), she told me I was useless and a failure and all I was good for was disappointment, I can't joke with her because she just gets offended at everything, when I was about 10 or 11, I made a little castle out of some cardboard boxes, and when I tried to show it to her, she told me I was too old for that kind of thing.

I know there are worse mothers out there, but I don't feel like I lucked out with mine. 




 I think it's because they're the more visible ones. The louder and more obnoxious someone in, the more people see them. The decent feminists are just normal people, so they don't stand out as much. 
























 Ah! That's the little dude in my gallery keeper :) That would definitely be something to add, thank you! 




 So the post about collections got me thinking... I don't have tons of neopoints, but they are just sitting there. There's nothing I'm saving up for. I'm just trying to make that number bigger, and that's not interesting. So after looking around, I decided to collect eyeball and eyeball-related eye-tems (hurhurhur i'm so funny)

Here's what I have so far!! http://www.neopets.com/gallery/?gu=elventhevamp :)

There are some items that I would like that I could not find though. Either they were nowhere to be found, or there was no price on the Trading Post, so I had no idea how much they are worth. Like I said, I don't have tons of money, so I'm really hoping to get them for under a certain amount each, but at the same time, I don't want to pay way less than the item's actually worth. So basically, if you have the item and want to sell it, just let me know your price and I will decide if I can afford it right now or not. If you don't have any of them/don't want to sell, but know about how much it's worth, that would be helpful, too. Here are the items:

* Jelly Spider Eyeball
* ~~Eye Candy Plushie~~
* ~~Chocolate Coated Eye~~
* Chilled Eyes with Clam Sauce
* Pink Spooky Ice Cream
* Holiday Eye Candy

Also, if you know of any other eyeball or eyeball-themed things, let me know! I checked Jellyneo's item database but I could have missed things that never actually say eye or eyeball anywhere :) And I know I'm missing Spaghetti  Eyeballs. I already made an offer on one on the trading post.

Thank you for your help!! 




 This makes me think I should collect something. Mostly I collect neopoints right now. 




 When you first realized it, how did you feel? How do you feel about it now? How do you feel in general? Did you sleep well last night? Any interesting dreams? What brand of toothpaste do you use? 




 Ever since my last (and only) serious boyfriend dumped me almost two years ago, I've had a feeling that I was going to die alone. It's not one of those dramatic thoughts like, oh god I was dumped now no one will ever love me, sort of things. Just a quiet realization. I'm going to die alone.

My history with romance is pretty shitty. The first guy I ever had a crush on admitted to me that he liked me... He just liked my friend better. The first boy I dated dumped me after three weeks, in public, in such a nonchalant way I can only guess he was never actually attached to me. I dated a girl the next year; she dumped me after four days because she decided she wasn't bisexual after all. I caught her making out with our mutual female friend a week later.

I lost my virginity to a guy who was horny and I was convenient. He got off and kicked me out. I started having sex with a guy who said I was attractive, but he wasn't interested in a relationship with me six months later, just because I was sad and lonely and would take any attention I could get.

After he got sick of me, I avoided romance for a while. I went on a date or two with guys I met on plentyoffish when I was feeling particularly lonely, but it never went past one date. Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake.

After a year long, turbulent, emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive relationship, he finally dumped me after I tried to kill myself, because he decided that if I was trying to kill myself, then he must not be making me happy.

My most recent foray into romance is one that is still hurting right now. Basically, about six months ago, I fell for a guy who lives overseas; he claimed to like me too, but couldn't do a relationship, let alone a long distance one (whereas, at this point in my life, I would prefer one; physical contact makes me ill). Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow.

It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it.

I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income. I'm useless. I can't take any classes at college because I'm too easily overwhelmed.

I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to commit suicide. I just want to die in my sleep. I want to stop existing. I'm so tired of being so sad all the time. What is the point of me? Nothing.

I'm fat. I can't diet because I have no will power. I'm ugly. I can't take care of myself. Doing anything beyond sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gives me crippling panic attacks. I'm boring. I don't know how to talk to people. Even my dog doesn't want to be around me these days. I'm angry all the time, or depressed. No wonder no one likes me.

I absolutely loathe my brain. It's trying to kill me, it's trying to destroy me. It wants me to feel this way. I want to know what it's like to be able to function. Not even be happy; just FUNCTION. I can't even do that, though.

No wonder I'm going to die alone.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I don't know what I want to hear. I guess I just want to tell someone, and there's no one in my life I could say this stuff to. I feel like a burden, an annoyance, someone who doesn't really matter. I'm scared to sleep because I know if I lay down in bed, I'm just going to think awful thoughts and make myself feel worse than I already do. 




 It's less funny when the sticker has obviously been moved. 




 This works for me most of the time, but then sometimes, when it lands on the side I hoped it would, I realize I actually wish it had landed on the other. Then I continue flip-flopping. I'm so indecisive. 




 Even better, my aunt would make me edible play dough that i would slowly consume while playing with it. When I got my first chance to play with actual Play-Doh, I tried to do the same. Not a good idea. 




 The graphics in 3 are beautiful, I went back and played 1 after finishing 3, and I was blown away. I remember thinking 1 had great graphics.

The game play is great, too, but you can tell when they just wanted to show off ;) 




 Is her top being torn from that guy grabbing her? 




 That might have something to do with it. 




 I would experience vivid hallucinations while on Ambien, and sometimes I would take it specifically for them. But you are right, I would end up forgetting 90% of what happened after, and I did do some stupid, stupid things on it. I've never experimented with a proper hallucinogen, though. Honestly, when I first read the title, I thought it was asking about hallucinations in general, but after I got the first comment, I realized what it actually said. Figured it wasn't so off topic that I should delete the comment, though. 




 This happens for me when I would take a low dose, slight hallucinations, but nothing big. Those were more enjoyable than the monsters clawing at my bed. 




 It's really common to hallucinate on Ambien. My doctor recommended taking half a pill instead, and keeping my eyes closed until I'm asleep, which worked better. 




 Leg warmers, mostly for sewing practice :) Too ugly to wear IMO 




 I can imagine it wouldn't smell that great, but I can imagine some far worse smelling jobs. 




 I'm working on my self-confidence right now, and what I've been doing is challenging my negative thoughts. It's helping, slowly but surely. Try to think of reasonable explanations for why the thought isn't true, or in some cases, how you can fix it. 




 It is probably a confidence issue. If you were more confident, you might not doubt her feelings for you, or be afraid of getting rejected.  




 What makes this the worst smelling job?  




 Give her some good scritches for me :) She's a pretty dog. 




 It also makes it look like you have other, more important things than talking to her. Just text her when you want to. 




 Thanks for answering them. :D 




 The opposite is "I embarrassed myself in front of a girl and she didn't hate me after". 




 How long were you awake before you went to sleep? When will you get another chance to sleep? How long will you sleep then? What class are you going to? Do you like the subject? Do you like your teacher? Are there are lot of other students in the class? If you could have any animal as a pet, what would you pick? 




 When I was younger, I was prescribed Ambien for sleep. I also lived with  my mom at the time.

So the first night after I get it, I take one. I lay down to go to sleep, and wait for the medicine to start to work. I never really started to feel tired, but I started seeing things move. It gets worse and worse. The shadows turn into monsters, and they start crawling towards me. I could feel them grabbing my blanket and pulling it off me. I started screaming, and I actually grabbed my cell phone to call my mom (who was in the other bedroom) instead of doing something like turn on the lights. Instead of answering, though, she just bursts into my room angrily and yells "What are you doing calling me?!" as she turns on the light.

I told her about the monsters, which were gone now that the light was gone, and she made me sleep next to her that night. I laid awake most of the night and stared at her ceiling, which was covered in circus people urging me to turn the light on because they had a show for me.

That was a weird night. 




 That fur looks so soft, I want to run my hands through it. 




 You could go with a friend and make them say it. 









 I would be worried if I saw a vagina that looked like that.

 A root beer float in the summer, and hot cocoa loaded with homemade marshmallows in the winter. 




 I think I just stared at this for five minutes. I don't think I've ever stared at chicken wire that long before. 




 That I will probably never be someone really amazing or world-changing, or famous for anything. That I am part of the average. I might be slightly better at some things than others, but I'm never going to be amazing enough to be anything other than average. 




 Agreed. I hate the fact that I have to struggle and take medicine and therapy and really think about what I'm doing just stay somewhat in a normal range of emotion, and if I slack off for one day, everything can go wrong. 
























 I just finished watching through Brotherhood a third time and I don't remember this happening at any point... Thank you though. 




 This doesn't sound familiar to me. Thank you, though. 




 When he got mad, he would try to pull it out but it wouldn't come out of the sheath all the way and he would sort of wiggle it I think.

I want to say it's from either a video game or an anime, but I'm not sure. I think it was a young boy with a normal size sword. That's all I can really remember. 




 I actually quite like that saying. It's my start up message on my phone.

To me, it means something along the lines of...you can't undo what has already happened. It is what it is. You can't change how you got to this point in your life, you have to accept the way things are in order to start changing them to work towards a better future.

Also what imahippocampus said, it can mean if you can't change something right now, then you have to accept that and work with it or around it.  




 Okay... I see. This makes a lot more sense than anything I've read before (that I can remember!)

So, quick question, why does "il mange du riz" end up as "il ne mange pas de riz"? I understand that "du" is "de le", but why did the "le" disappear from the negative? Are "Il mange de riz" and "Il ne mange pas du riz" also correct?

I'm using Rosetta Stone as a refresher and I'm beginning to regret it just a bit, because it doesn't answer questions like this. 




 This is just something I can't seem to wrap my head around. Same with "de la". I think I have "des" for the most part, but I could still use some explanation for that.

I thought "de la" meant "of the", but I never see "de le"? Is "de la" the feminine version of "du"? So then what is "de"? If it's the feminine version of "de", then what is "du"? What is "of" or "of the" in French?

"Des", as far as I can tell, is used for multiples of items instead of "les" to say something like "I have some plates" instead of "I have the plates".

I've taken French classes, though I took my last one around 8 years ago, closer to 9 now, with Japanese classes since then, so I've forgotten basically everything and I'm starting from scratch with "je m'appelle train_subject6146". I've looked it up on Google before, but the explanations never seem to stick. I still can't get it... Can someone explain it to me in simple terms? 




 Awesome :) You look great in both modes! 









 I LOVE the Borealis series! I have six sets of (mostly) different colors :) 




 I want more than a trim, and I dyed my hair at least 3 times a year for 9 years. I'm ready to be my natural color for a while. You can kind of see in the pictures where I had orangey-yellow hair and dyed dark brown over it in an attempt to return to my natural hair color. Thank you for your comment, though.  




 I like this answer a lot. I've always had the philosophy of cut first, think later, because it WILL grow back, but for some reason, this one made me hesitate. I think it's because of all the "fat girls can't wear pixie cuts". Thank you! This was really helpful. 




 Can you provide me with an example of what you mean?

Thank you :) 




 I had long hair most of my life, but after a breakup, I chopped my hair off to my chin because my ex liked my long hair, and I was tired of taking care of the length. I didn't regret it, and have since kept my hair between chin and just below my shoulder length, but now I'm thinking I want to go even shorter.

I'd like a pixie cut, I think they are very cute, but I'm afraid my face is too round (aka I'm too fat) for one.

Pictures for reference:

http://i.imgur.com/opFqZy3.jpg Me with my hair down, unstyled and finger-combed

http://i.imgur.com/wZBtK46.jpg Me with my hair pulled back into a bun

I definitely want to cut my hair short, shorter than I've had it before (chin length), because my ends are really unhealthy, so any suggestions for a style other than pixie would be helpful.

For reference to body type, here's a full body picture: http://i.imgur.com/VGb4FNk.png 




 It's at 1 PM PST. I found the time zone on his Tumblr. 




 My friend says I have to be a pun master because I always make them and never notice until someone points it out. 




 I've made several attempts to clean my room and keep it clean in the past. It would always get back to how it was before really quickly, though. This time I took before  after pictures... The before pictures are really helpful. If I ever need a reminder of why I should tidy up, those pictures are there to remind me of how bad it can get. 




 Yeah, some! I'm still trying to balance out meds and stuff and I still get down sometimes but it definitely makes it easier to manage. It's one less thing to worry about and get upset at myself for. 




 Oh man that is very painful :( 




 Oh! I thought it was just items that had a higher chance of getting taken by the pant devil, not an actual item called that! Haha, thanks :) 




 I kind of figured that, but what sort of items are pant devil attractors? 




 What are "pant devil attractors"? I don't deal with a lot of high priced items (that dubloon was really pricey to me) but I would really like to avoid this happening in the future. 




 The original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/11u832/as_a_sufferer_of_depression_for_most_of_my_life/

The hard part was keeping it clean, though. And I'll admit, it got kind of out of control at one point, but before it got as bad as before, I got busy trying to clean it up again. This is how it looks today.

Someone suggested I do a 1 month update, but I kept forgetting, so here's a 3 month update instead. 









 I had 22 items in my inventory at the time. I try to keep under 30, and I keep a lot of 1 np items out to slim down the chances of my rarer items getting zapped. I always thought carrying more than 50 items was bad so I try to keep it in the 20s...

And yeah :) THAT dubloon is safely in my SDB right now! 




 This was painful to read. 




 I had literally just gotten it :( I was on my way to put in there when this happened, but Ririi was awesome enough to supply me with a new one :) It's safely in my SDB right now 




 Ahhh! Thank you!! You are too kind! :'D 




 I keep very small amounts of np out of my bank. I don't care about the trophy/avatar. I want my np to stay where they are, they are already so few in number. 




 I'm so paranoid, I usually go to my inventory immediately to put it away, but I stopped at the bank... Learn from my mistakes :( 














 She always brings pockets full of treats and she's the only person who actually gives her food when she begs (no matter how many times we tell her not to). She really spoils my dog, it's probably a good thing she doesn't come over that often. 









 I do not! Thank you Sir :)
