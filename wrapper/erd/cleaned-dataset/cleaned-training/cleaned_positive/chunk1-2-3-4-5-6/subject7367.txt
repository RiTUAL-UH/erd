 what the ever loving fuck 




 in light of recent events, thank you for this. i had almost given up on the human spirit 
























 I have been thinking about communicating thoughts and emotions through feeling with other people, and I realized something.
We may never truly communicate and empathize, so long as we depend on 26 letters to hurl our thoughts into open space. 




 but what was on the back? 
























 TIL snipes are real 





























 it's my first, he's a champ 





























 Thank you so much, I'll remember that. 




 ah yes the american savannah beasts 
























 Thank you, my mother is an extremely negative person and although she doesn't mean to, she makes me feel very hopeless. I was nervous to post about this because I didn't know if anyone would care but the response (and the responses I see here every day) give me so much hope. 




 I cried when reading this but I think it was happy tears. Thank you, this was an immense help
