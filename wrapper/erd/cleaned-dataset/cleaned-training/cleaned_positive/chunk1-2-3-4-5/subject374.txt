 Had a coughing fit while bending over my bathroom sink, the angle I was standing at made my back seize up and I ended up damaging the sciatic nerve that runs down my leg and into my foot which meant my left foot was numb for about 3 months.

 8 years ago I applied for a retail job selling handbags, the store manager told me that there was a promising second in charge role opening in the next few months and because of my experience he had worked hard to negotiate with HR so that I could be paid an additional 10 cents per hour...the pay would have come to $10.20 per hour. I appreciate his efforts but it made the company sound a bit too thrifty. 




 Thanks for the advice!! :)

 You interpreted the question just fine. Your comment still stands.

 Awesome!! Congrats :) 




 No beating around the bush - I like it! 









 Good work! 




 Congrats to you both! 









 Taylor Hanson. Yes. 




 When I was 23 I was diagnosed with severe Aplastic Anemia (rapid depletion of red and white blood cells as well as platelets) the same thing Marie Curie died of. I was given a pamphlet after my diagnosis that stated 80% of people diagnosed who do not receive treatment die within a year.  




 Unconditional love and support from true friends...and BACON 




 My mother stood up for my eldest bro when he didn't want to do a blood test to see if he was a bonemarrow match when I was severely ill and needing a bonemarrow transplant...her reasoning - he doesn't want to take time off work.

 My ex used to do the same thing except he would ask me to wash and dry his outfit for him!! 




 Up until the beginning of this year I had been friends with this person for 11 years since our uni days. In hindsight, it was a toxic friendship - I had to constantly walk on eggshells for fear of pissing him off, he constantly had tantrums, was very calculative and he only helped others if it benefited him. Everyone was scared to stand up to him because we didn't want to rock the boat. 

After coming home from a road trip with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday I spoke to a mutual friend about how hurt I was that this friend constantly sulked, got angry and even gave me the silent treatment for a couple of hours. This "friend" had told me on my birthday that when friends piss him off, he likes to make them feel like shit. That was the last straw for me, that's not what friendship is about. 
This mutual friend told this guy what I had said and obviously this "friend" of mine was royally pissed and started ignoring me while trying to gather a merry band of idiots to turn against me as well. He managed to turn another friend I had known for 11 years against me but was unsuccessful with the others. (We're all in our late to early 30s)

We never patched things up, I was very upset about it all for months but then I started realising that I was finally free of this toxic influence in my life and I could now enjoy the friendships I choose to nurture. It's not about how long you've known the person, it's about the kind of influence they have that matters for example, whether they're positive and supportive people. It's still very awkward when our original group gets together but it's OK, I'm spending most of my time now with wonderful amazing friends. 




 It's the simple things in life for me, I'm trying to appreciate what I have and concentrate my energy on the things I enjoy the most in order to find my own inner happiness and contentment. My biggest problem I'm trying to work on is to continue to work towards issues within my circle of influence rather than factors that I have no control over (circle of concern). 




 I'm from New Zealand - my impressions of the following states:

Texas - Steak all day everyday
Florida - Key Lime Pie
Louisiana - Creole shrimp, okra and collard greens
Maine - Clam Chowder
NYC - Street vendor hot dogs
Hawaii- Spam
Illinois - Deep dish Pizza

 Not seeking professional help when I first needed it, instead I've wasted years going through periods of depression and self-loathing - not realising that I was the reason for my own unhappiness.

 Good luck!! :) 




 A Beef Wellington would impress me! 




 You ABSOLUTELY need to give it a shot before you move away! Good Luck! 









 Were you guys able to recover from it? 




 Did they work? 









 If only I could figure out how to clone you....I'd make a fortune :) 




 Yikes! You're ridiculously hot and in my humble honest opinion - heads and shoulders above the rest of the boys on here ;P Keep on keeping on :)  




 Sherlock - Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are awesome! A 2 year gap between seasons is far too long though.
 
























 A rough looking homeless guy approached me at the bus stop in the city, I figured he would ask for spare change or a ciggie - he instead asks me "what's a lovely girl like you doing in a dump like this". Sweet man made my day.

 I had a PICC line inserted when I was 23 (severe aplastic anemia) right in the bend of my elbow. It was definitely a strange experience that coldness. Hope you're all good now!

 I don't visit my immediate family because they're cold and miserable people who don't care about anyone else but themselves. I wish I knew what it was like to grow up in a loving home.  




 Shaun of the Dead - great date movie that one! 




 I was on a school camping trip and we had gone snorkeling one afternoon, our guide for the day can't have been more than 5 years older and was smoking hot. I wasn't a huge fan of breathing out of my snorkel so I was slightly panicking. When I saw from my underwater view that everyone was perched on a rock resting I was stoked. I was even more stoked to see that among all the perchers was the smoking hot guide in a wet suit that hugged all the right places. I "accidentally on purpose" grabbed his junk as he helped me climb up onto the rock. I was 12. 









 I've been losing confidence in myself lately which makes me worried about doing a shit job, so I was hoping for advice on how to be a better leader. Thank you all for your suggestions! 




 You had me at "meat" üçó 









 thanks!

 Aye? Her automatic payment had already processed, she went ahead and made another payment through online banking because she didn't read her invoice that stated she didn't have to do anything further - we're happy to refund the second payment back but I don't see how that's our "system's fault" that she didn't read the information on her invoice. People have a responsibility as a consumer to read the information they are given for a product/service they subscribe to. 




 I'm trying to see if my mate's bro is full of shit :)

 That's just one that bugged me, I didn't have time to add any of my other stories. There was a time someone wasn't happy with our policies (her bill was very much overdue) she was yelling and swearing for approximately 19 mins straight and after telling her my surname (she asked) she completely lost her shit...."what kind of surname is that?" blah blah blah and questioning whether I was "even a New Zealander" - that stung a little bit.  




 I organised it for her, no worries there - just would have been nice to take ownership of her own error. 




 A customer had accidentally paid her bill twice, she lets me know that she wasn't aware she had an automatic payment set up and stated that she was a busy teacher ("grappling with reports etc.") so she picked up the invoice and paid it without thinking. She suggested the "system" should be clearer to remind her about the automatic payment. The bill clearly states she has an automatic payment in place and that she does not need to worry about making a payment....no wonder she's grappling with those reports... 




 woot!  




 hahaha exactly!  




 I heard you bleed heavily for 4-6 weeks after giving birth..is this true??

 My maternal great-grandmother had "Lotus Feet" - her feet were bound from when she was a little girl. Apparently she could scrub floors and run pretty surprisingly fast in those tiny shoes. A pair of her shoes is currently part of an exhibition in a London museum. 




 I've definitely put pressure on myself because I haven't accomplished what I "should have" by now - glad to hear things can get better! Thanks for sharing :) 









 In the scene where Thranduil says goodbye to Legolas by gesturing to his heart and then to Legolas who reaches out - was that a typical elvish gesture?

 So many BS self-proclaimed feminists have tarnished the term for me personally. I recently met one who loves to "fight the good fight" but actually has no idea what she's fighting for/about - she just makes a whole lot of noise for attention and is a hater when other chicks aren't "feminist" enough. Her displays of judgement and hating on other women are sad, ironic and hypocritical.  




 haha absolutely! Feel free to share more military bus stories! 




 I hope there was an applause!!  




 Lol I'll let you know if it works!

 I completely agree with you - I miss those good ol' days of being so comfortable with someone that you could do/ask weird stuff :) 




 Great advice here - unfortunately, I learnt this the hard way due to a lot of denial on my part. 




 Regrets. 




 To be honest, if a guy I was into had pics of naked women as their wallpaper - I'd be nervous and intimidated because I wouldn't be able to live up to those ideals. 

In saying that, I appreciate looking at an aesthetically pleasing male body so I wouldn't want to be a hypocrite. 




 this is strangely appealing to me.. 




 Witty sense of humour, humility and a great smile work wonders for me! 




 We were together for 2 years and lived together for a year. I came home one day to find some of his stuff gone with a note on the table stating this was the hardest thing he's ever had to do but he has to leave and he'll call the landlord to tell her we're moving out. 

To date, my heart has not sunk as dramatically as it did that day.

 I overheard two girls having a bitchy conversation and wondered whether anyone has any good stories about conversations they've overheard. 




 Sounds cold but at the same time I really want to say well played!!!! 




 My parents transferred me to a new high school when I was 14 and I absolutely hated it. I decided not to go for about a week and a half and just stayed in my room and locked the door. My parents were at work but my bro was still home and he would bang on the door and i'd hide in the closet just in case he came in. 

I had to think of elaborate ways to appear like I had gone to school so one day I decided to throw my backpack out of the window and I climbed out of my second storey bedroom window and was holding onto the window sill trying to decide whether I'd jump onto the bush below or just try to slide my way down somehow. 
Ended up realising how stupid I was being and climbed back in. 




 I've had lots of experiences that have made me question whether I'm experiencing terrible nightmares or if there really is something happening. I've seen things coming out of the walls, faceless shadow people standing at the foot of my bed staring at me and every single time I can see my room in absolute detail.  




 Lack of confidence 




 It's cute - post a pic of your cat! 




 Josh. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from screwing things up, I could have had a chance at happiness.  




 Consequences. Spent too much time being two-faced and a backstabber, what goes around - comes around.  




 Making judgments/assumptions 




 Mine are a decent size I guess so I understand that people may stare - regardless of whether I'm showing cleavage or trying to smuggle grapefruits. Don't care and not bothered, I'm proud of them! 




 Finally completing the Bachelor degree I had been stopping and starting for the past 11 years.  
























 1) There are girls who want the attention but get snappy when they're not drawing attention from specific people they are seeking attention from. 

2) There are girls who make the effort to look nice for themselves - a little boost to their self-esteem and not necessarily attention from others although that also helps to boost their confidence. 

3) There are girls who try to one up each other - female competition. 




 Thank you. 
I find it really hard to get up in the morning, I find myself getting anxious the night before counting the hours of sleep I'll get. I can sleep 12 hours solid and still want more sleep. Ironically, I stay up late because I don't want to sleep. 
Hope things work out for you too! 




 Update - back to work today. Put on my mask this morning and went about my day acting "normal" with the odd occasion of staring out the window thinking. Thinking. That's always been my problem - trying to find ways to switch it off but my mind is always racing and whizzing from one topic to another and then back again. 

Today's motto has been "fake it til you make it" and hopefully this wave will pass soon if I keep myself distracted.  




 Thank you. 

I went through a period of having to take some pretty serious heavy duty meds for a serious illness (prednisone and cyclosporin) the side effects really messed me up which adds to my fear but you're right - there are a lot of different drugs out there so if something doesn't work, there's always other alternative combos. 

Hope your journey continues to be a safe and happy one!

 I've posted in /r/whatsthatbook and /r/tomt but no luck so far, a redditor suggested I try this page so here goes!

I read this book back in the late 90s and I have never forgotten how crazy, graphic and messed up it was. It would have been in the same vein as books by Dean Koontz and Richard Laymon. 




 Thanks for the tip! 




 Thanks - will definitely give it a go! 




 Not the one but definitely need to put it on my to read list, thanks! If I do find out what it's called I'll let you know. I read this when I was younger so the details are a bit hazy but I remember reading it thinking ooh probably too young for this.
 




 Just did a quick wiki search and yeah same vein

 Oohh i'll look for it tomo, has anyone seen him in Soldier's Girl or Possession? 




 I saw a scene on Youtube from one of his movies, he picks up this chick with such ease and kisses her against a post or wall while her legs are wrapped around him - was sooo damn  hot! 




 Even though I'm not quite ready to have children right now I would like to have the option in the near future so yes, it would be very hard. I definitely wouldn't want to try and change the guy's mind if he's already made the decision, that wouldn't be fair at all!

 Attempted to have phone sex when I was 13 with a boy I had a huge crush on. Unfortunately, my dad had picked up the phone downstairs, heard our conversation and started yelling. 
We had a caller ID display so he raced upstairs and proceeded to call my crush back to yell some more. My crush's dad ended up jumping on the phone and our dads yelled at each other. 

A week later I was enrolled in a girl's only school.

 I'd strongly recommend that you go to a recruitment agency and have a good chat to them about what kind of roles you may be interested in. They may have a bit more insight as to what kind of roles your transferable skills could be beneficial for.

 Scared of being rejected 




 Hey - don't stop doing what you're doing. 
I personally don't think we have a valid excuse to be rude to guys who approach us simply because we're "not in the mood" or we're already taken. If you genuinely just want to say hi and start a friendly conversation, there shouldn't be anything wrong with that!

If you're being sleazy/creepy and all up in our personal space too soon and getting touchy/feely - our body language will tell you we're uncomfortable then yeah, chances are you're going to end up getting rejected. Outside of these kind of scenarios - a rude bullshit snappy "not interested" is pretty stink. Turn right around and walk away - you just dodged a bullet. 
 




 Exactly! And then if the answer is no you can move on. What have you got to lose? Good luck and let us know how it went!!

In my opinion, when my texts start getting a bit sparse and short i'm actually just politely answering your texts but I'm also losing or feigning interest - I need to stop doing that and just be up front.
