 Its really weird, a year ago I couldn't even have imagined ever being this happy again. Even if I thought things were better, I still felt really bad and just assumed this is what "normal" is like. It feels really strange sometimes now. 
























 I wish you all the best - keep trying and don't be afraid to change things in your life if you feel you need too. 
























 Something I do which has really helped me was to write down three things I was happy with every day - at first it was only small things, that I took a shower or that I made a proper meal ... Then, when I felt really horible, couldn't sleep I looked at the list and tried to think about the stuff I had written down and not the misstakes I made. 
























 It was the only thing I managed to eat at the time :-D I bought huge ammounts of it when I found the energy to go shopping and survived off of it the rest of the time. It was winter/christmas time I think 3 years ago. 
























 I tried pretty much every SSRI and tricyclical antidepressant in existence over the last years. Its hard to give you a full list because I know only the local names and frankly a lot I have already forgotten again. Unfortunately for me I never really had any major success with it. I am not knocking meds I know a lot of people where they really helped. Its hard to say how it would have been without the meds at the time of course, maybe it would have gotten even worse.

I never had any major side effects, I was on Venlafaxine a long time which killed my ability to get it up, which was annoying but not a big deal because I was never in a relationship anyways :) Other than that I never had any side effecets on any of the meds I tried.
