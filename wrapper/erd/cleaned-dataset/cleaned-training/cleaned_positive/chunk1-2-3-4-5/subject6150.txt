 "The is no such thing as a accident." I still feel awful whenever I make a mistake. 




 Over the Top 




 I really suggest trying it out. I was surprised as to how much more energy I had.  




 Have you talked to your doctor about the seasonal component of your mood swings?  I have Seasonal Affect Disorder and was prescribed a special lamp that has really done wonders for me.  I am sure you can pull out of this.  Just keep pushing through. I know it sucks, but supposedly it gets better.  
























 Will do! I have been limited to my phone for Internet access, I'll upload it to cuberutor as soon as I can! 




 People. People are shit. 




 I once told an adopted kid at least my parents loved me enough to keep me... 




 My father threw my sister out of the house for burning a pizza. She was 21 at the time, just graduated, and was looking for a job. She was forced to move in with our older sister. 
























 My LGS is having sealed commander tournement.  Which deck do you think has the best shot at winning? Which deck seems like the worst? 




 I noticed you are making a casual deck and didn't include balance, tinker, channel or fastbond. This should probably be fixed... 




 Thank you for your input! I included a couple more duals as well as nixing the storm cards, I tried forcing it a couple times and it was far too weak. I was kinda aiming for a more multicolor oriented cube. Should I add more multicolor to emphasize this? Or will this just weaken my cube overall?  





























 Blowgun. 




 My penis 




 Buy in is just the precon at msrp. The prize is a sealed commander's arsenal... 




 I'll work on adding more color fix! 
























 No worries though, I called no homo a few months ago. 




 I think the rule is its only gay if you finish. 




 Balance because tears. 




 They are usually evenly matched. My fiance and I only play duel decks or draft together; we love them. But, if you are looking to pull them apart for the cards you are better off just buying the singles. It really depends on if you want to play with others, or just with the girlfriend. If you want to play with others hit up your local game store see what they play!
