 EDIT: to clarify the question, mid-range Top 5 Best Brands... I have seen the sidebar. I'm just curious to find out what you guys like. 




 Okay, thanks for your reply. I couldn't find the tuition on their website (Empire Beauty School) - I may have overlooked. I will keep researching. 




 I'm on Lexapro. I just started taking it on April 23rd.  Wasn't too long ago.

The doctor diagnosed me with chronic depression (I've had depression since I was 11/12 years old... I'm 26 now) and anxiety. He felt Lexapro would be a good start for me to be on it.

With the medication, it does help but lately for some reason, I'm always up this late and I would go to bed at 2am.  Then again, it may not be related to the medication. I feel my body running on fumes. I'm exhausted.  Though I feel the need to be on computer often now because I find myself becoming more entertained on it. I feel the need to research and find new ideas in life.  Am I trying too hard to pursue, trying to get my life back in order? To make up for lost times?? I don't know, I don't get myself.  I still find myself, staying inside at my home and I would be on computer most of the time.

I think it's fear of change.  There are times when I would think that change is good. It's nice doing something different.  But there are times when I would lose interest, no motivation to do something different, to do something productive and I would try, at all cost, to avoid change because I am feeling comfortable with the way I am and how I am.

I am still adjusting to the medication so the question would be when would it start working for me? I know the doctor said it may take 4 to 6 weeks to take in full effect of the medication.

Maybe I'm impatient, I don't know. I just want to live my life. 




 This is my first time, posting this in MakeupAddiction... so bear with me... It's after midnight. I may have not made sense in this entry so feel free to comment with your questions and I will try to clarify as best as I can.

I have done my research and is hoping to pursue in attending to a beauty school soon.

I was wondering if there are others who have already attended or is currently attending to a beauty school... because there is a school in Rochester, NY (I am located there). It's called Empire Beauty School and they have the Make Up program.  I am trying to find out how much it would cost to attend to a beauty school.

But not only am I looking into that, I am hoping to see if I could find a school that does have a major in a program that would allow me to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Make Up (or in Cosmetics). I don't know if there is one but it would be incredible and it would allow me to explore further with the makeup trends.

Do you have any recommendations with beauty schools?? Any ideas or tips? 




 I hope the op don't mind if I add my question in this because we're basically discussing the same thing - ChaosProz and I are from VA so yes, I know the op.  My car's title belongs to my mother but the car was given to me so in order to transfer the title to me, PLUS changing from VA to NY plates... I know the answer now with how much to get NY plates... but how does title work? Does it cost extra money? What do I need to prepare for when I go in DMV to get it all done? 




 I lost my first dog, Harley (she was a miniature schnauzer and she was only nine years old), two years ago (I was also 24 - I'm turning 26 in two days, this Saturday the 21st) and I never realized how much the passing of her really was devastating me.  I was already dealing with depression and this loss was **really** painful.  I knew I needed to talk to someone outside of my husband, my family, and friends so I wanted to try to talk to someone in therapy.  It did help every session I went.  So maybe try therapy in your own time when you're ready.

I'm sorry for your loss, and I truly understand. Sending positive light and love your way with your family. 




 I just don't agree with breaking up over text - that just shows immaturity on her part. I think she could have just talked to you about it in person. I would understand why she want to avoid arguing but that's the whole point of a relationship - to actually communicate with each other.  If not arguing, it could give you guys a chance to agree in mutual terms. 




 I just feel a bit conflicted with this one because the way I was taught by an instructor, she had told me I don't really need music or any kind of distractions to get in the way while I meditate. Otherwise it would have defeat the purpose of silencing your mind, body and soul and listen to your own breathing, to become one with yourself.  I just feel that music helps a bit to relax.  

I have deep anxiety and I try to meditate as much as I can to fit in my busy schedule. I overthink so much, it takes control of me.  And I can't help feeling it all at once when I overthink, even I am more aware that I am overreacting but I just can't seem to take control and recognize I am overthinking.

Any tips or ideas how to quiet my mind down? 




 One step at a time!! :) 




 25/f - wanting kids probably next year or so with the husband (24). We just got married in August. :) 
























 Thank you so much!!  




 It does help, thank you very much! 




 I have never thought of that - I'm already on reading books on makeup and color theory and following real working professionals online but never thought of practicing on friends/family.

When you said get a job at a store/counter - let's just say Macy's... I can get a job there without a certificate or license? 




 I was also looking at that too - I wanted to be sure that it is the real deal as well. 




 I'm looking for an online school that I can afford to enroll in and receive a certificate/license.  I was wondering if there is one... if so, what would you recommend?? 




 Amazing colors!!  




 Gorgeous! Love the color! 









 Correct me if I'm wrong...

Please tell me if I'm being vague. I will try my best to clarify. I saw the sidebar and NYX was fallen under drugstore HG Master List.  I know they sell it in CVS, Walgreens, Ulta Beauty, etc. but I feel most of their products are excellent in quality and it is affordable. Do you think it could count as mid-range? Why or why not? 




 I would just keep checking back. I usually order at NYX online and believe me, I know the feeling when there's a specific item out of stock and the frustration kicks in.  I also follow them on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It just is easier for me to keep track with them. Hope this helps. 
























 Yay!! Welcome to Reddit!!! 

Fantastic tips, I would definitely look into it! 




 Thank you for the /r/BeautyGuruChat - definitely helpful!!! 




 :O I love this set up!! 




 Eyebrow shape suggestions and lipstick colors??

 I created my own make up channel recently and I feel that it'd be a great journey for me; to help me learn new things at the same time while making videos and grow.  I also believe this will hone my skills over time.  Are there any tips you can give while creating videos? What should I do and shouldn't do?

Your comments would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks! 




 Thank you so much for the CC, I'll keep that in mind with the mascara, eyeliner, and the lipstick shade :) 




 I just noticed the lower left picture that has a black line on my face - my fault. I cleaned that up already and it looks better without it. So sorry in advanced if anyone sees it lol.

 What is the best, safe way to remove nails at home?  I just would like to see my natural nails again.  I haven't seen them for a couple of months and they're really growing long so, I just would like to admire them and finally is able to paint nail polish on my nails rather than using fake nails... 




 But I am willing to travel. I like traveling as well. 




 Yes, thank you 




 Yes, I'm in Rochester, NY. 




 I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask.  I was wondering if there are beauty/makeup conventions I can go to?? 




 I really wish I did a better research before starting my own channel but then a come a few videos later, I realized I needed to do better.  So here I am, trying to fix and improve my channel.

Great advices, I will keep this in mind.  I'm also brand new to YouTube as well so whoohoo, good luck to us!! 
























 I used the sponge this time.  I used Ulta Super Blender Sponge.  Thanks for the tips, next time I will blend it a bit more. 




 I was able to turn on AC and it does give air but it's not cool anymore as it should be.  What is the price range of getting AC refill? (am located in Rochester, NY) 




 I created [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/368i68/highlight_contour_ccw/) thread not too long ago, struggling with using NYX Highlight and Contour Pro Palette.  So I wanted something simple and hopefully this time, I am on the right track with the contouring and highlight.

I used NYX Stay Matte but Not Flat Liquid Foundation and the color is Nude and I used NYX Wonder Stick Highlight and Contour - Light/Medium.

Here is the current look WITH the wonder stick: [photos are here](http://imgur.com/a/Kz05b)

Please let me know what you guys think.

P.S. I posted a picture of the pro palette in the earlier thread. If you guys could guide me to select shades that may be a better fit for me to contour and highlight, I would greatly appreciate it for all your help.  Thank you! 




 I never met my father.  

In the past, I struggled often because I always see little girls holding fathers' hands and I get extremely upset/jealous a bit, maybe.  Then I would get really angry at times.  I wasn't really handling it well, growing up.  I was also very fragile because I kept losing family members and friends (they died) around me.  So it was difficult for my mother to be able to tell me.  She wanted to wait until I get older; when I'm more mentally and emotionally prepared for the big, full story about my father.

I was 24 years old when I found out. Father's Day rolled around in June 2013.  Then I began to wonder about my father again.  I haven't thought about him for a couple of years until for some reason, I wanted answers. I felt ready to know what kind of father he was.  I researched, trying to find answers and I ended up finding his death certificate along with my half-brother's signature and phone number (I didn't know I had half-siblings).

Sadly I found out he passed in February 2010.  I was disappointed because I had planned on contacting him and try to get to know him and hope to meet him in person.

But I finally got in contact with my half siblings (one half brother and one half sister) I never knew until two years ago and they told me many stories about him.  Most of the stories weren't good, hence is why my mother protected me my whole life from not knowing what kind of father he was (he had a serious problem with alcohol and he was involved in drugs).  So my mom finally told me her story and everything made sense from there.

Even if I had meet him in person, I will end up feeling disappointed, seeing how my father turned out.

I learned the hard way, so for me, it's better that I know what kind of person he was and I would be better off without him in my life.  He wasn't a good person, especially to my half siblings.  They had it really rough, growing up around him and especially when he ran out on them multiple times and is good at disappearing.  He was no father figure.

Regardless with the struggles, growing up, I turned out fine.  I wouldn't be the person I am today.  I look up to my grandfather, as if he's my father.  I love him dearly.  I love my family.  I wouldn't have it any other way. 




 I'm looking for other places beside Goodwill...  




 Count me in :( I get terrible puffiness around my eyes, congested, itchy throat, and I basically can't really hear well in my ears. 




 I use a fan brush (Similar to this: http://stylebust.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Fan-Brush.jpg) first for my cheeks...  and then I use a contour brush (I have this brush: https://roundcheeksbeauty.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/c121b-realtechniquescontourbrushreview.jpg) for my forehead and temples.  I would use the same brush for blending as well.

Yes, I see the weird muddy gray as well.  I may have some contour and mixed it with highlight by mistake.  Should I get another brush to separate what it uses for, one for highlight and one for contour?

I used these shades. I circled the ones. See here: http://i.imgur.com/c8AVOht.jpg 

I also did this at 2am.  I will try again, following the tips.  I may try go to Sephora, MAC and Ulta to see if they could tell me the same how I should really highlight and contour in a proper way. 




 UPDATED:

http://imgur.com/gallery/VOM2t/

MAKEUP:

* NYX Pore Filler
* NYX Studio Perfect "Photo-Loving" Primer
* NYX Stay Matte But Not Flat Liquid Foundation - Nude
* NYX Highlight and Contour Pro Palette (this time I tried a really dark contour... not sure if I made the right call, selecting that color)

Aaah, I never realize how frustrating just to be sure the foundation and the highlight/contour has to be just right.  Plus the lighting in the room, with my light mirror stand, and the camera... (I used Logitech C920 Webcam)  it just gives off my face completely different than what I'm looking at. Hmmmmm.... 




 I knew the foundation was wrong for me.  I even asked for help at Ulta to find a good foundation and matches with my skin and they tell me that the foundation would suit me.  I have a different foundation so I will try another.

I'll keep that in mind with the contouring.  Thanks so much! 




 I want to be sure I'm on the right track with highlight and contour.

What I put on,

* NYX Pore Filler
* NYX Studio Perfect "Photo-Loving" Primer
* Maybelline Fit Me! Matte + Poreless - (120) Classic Ivory
* NYX Highlight and Contour Pro Palette

If you think the lighting in the photos aren't good, please let me know. I can retake photos and upload them.

Any advices or tips would be great. Thanks!
