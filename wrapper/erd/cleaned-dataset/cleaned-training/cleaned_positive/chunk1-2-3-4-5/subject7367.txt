 what the ever loving fuck 




 in light of recent events, thank you for this. i had almost given up on the human spirit 
























 I have been thinking about communicating thoughts and emotions through feeling with other people, and I realized something.
We may never truly communicate and empathize, so long as we depend on 26 letters to hurl our thoughts into open space.

 TIL snipes are real 





























 it's my first, he's a champ 





























 Thank you so much, I'll remember that. 




 ah yes the american savannah beasts
