 Title says it all. No harm in 3 years aside from punching the occasional wall, but compared to the hundreds of previous cuts I'll call that good. Even got better without the family ever knowing it was a problem. But I'm worse than ever before. Went off to grad school. In less than a year it sucked all the life from me. The hidden self hatred is like an exposed nerve without anything pleasurable to cover it up. Between my awful grades, disappointed professor, lack of any friends in a 75 mile radius, and lack of any romantic connections I'm losing my mind. I'm slowly driving my only true friend away via text because there's only so long s person can put up with this shit. Tonight I snapped a door off my kitchen cabinet and shattered  my mirror. I'm not angry at anyone but myself. I'm constantly angry at myself, screaming at me when no one else is around because just... Everything. I want to cut so badly but knowing I can't let myself just makes it even worse, like a firework in a tin can. I'm trying to hold on but damn... It's like my own mind is consciously trying to kill me and that's what drives me mad. It's conscious decisions, not blind impulse. Conscious decisions  I know I'll regret but feel compelled to do anyway. 




 I'm there right now. At my school, 4 grades below B- and you're out. I've got 4 now. Makes it damn hard to focus on my research and I'm drinking way more than I should be. I'm going back and forth between wall punching mad at myself and just... empty.

Hang in there, you aren't the only one lost in limbo. But I will tell you this. I'm working here until they kick me off the campus. Do what you can, and don't let it kill ya 




 No. I'm not asking for sympathy or I wouldn't have used a burner account. You can tell me I'm a piece of shit, should drop out and be a fry cook, or put a fucking bullet in my skull for all I care actually.

I came here to vent because I'm alone in this city and I'm tired of putting my fist through the wall when I hate myself. Noone said you have to listen or care. 




 I lied, he wasn't disappointed, apparently the reason he hung up is because "he is so mad that he isn't mad". Also he told the other students last night on the phone with them that "it doesn't look good for me", so we will see what happens... 




 burner account is obviously a burner

So I'm an engineering grad from a physics background, and was convinced, against the suggestion of the professor teaching the course, to take a strictly engineer type course my first year here. NEedless to say it was going awfully, but the department decided not to let me drop without revoking my TA, so again under the advice of my advisor, I pushed on. I'm not sure if it's the ADHD or if I'm just fucking stupid, but despite throwing myself at the class and focusing solely on the class, I bombed the fuck out of the final.

My advisor just called (it's 11pm) to ask how my exam went, and when I told him that I did better than the midterm but not nearly as well as I hoped, he didn't take it well. Instead of being his normal "swear at you and question your manhood" self, he just got quiet, and hung up on me.

I gave it everything I had, but after weeks of studying and a hell of a mental breakdown last night, it just wasn't enough. I don't know if I'm just too fucking stupid, or if I'm willfully trying to screw myself over, but my advisor's voice had that "you could die for all I care, I'm disappointing and I'm done with you" tone to it, and if I didn't hate myself before well after two semesters of this I sure as fuck sake do now.


Sorry, rant over. 
























 He's Gregory House. He lied about the not being a mD thing. Everybody lies. 




 Actually kinda helps  




 Maybe once I'm not using all my will trying not to put a fucking knife in my chest, I'll worry about finishing my PhD or working on that six-pack. Thanks, I hadn't considered the fact that not being my normal awful fucking self might require effort. 




 Not in the same way, but yes. Hundreds of medium sized cuts on a small area over months left me with the same feeling. Oddly enough, nerve damage makes tattoos in the area hurt more, for whatever reason

A lot of us have been there I wager. While I can't say going to a hospital or clinic is a bad idea, if you won't, an EMT I spoke with about a similar incident told me to at least use butterfly tape to seal it closed. It will heal without it, but may stay open for a few weeks while it does so, and the scar will be wider if not taped.

Take care Knyburg, and hang in there 




 For doing awfully in school, for not making the most of my opportunities, for being awful and unattractive (and for thinking that while lying in bed instead of working out), for being so angry at myself and so depressing, the list just goes on

I don't know, I've never had anger problems with anyone else. I can be patient for ever with them but me... There's just too much hatred there not to get angry. 
























 Astounding story as well 




 But by then you could bounce to the Far East with your riches, wait a few generations and buy several countries back from the Dutch as their empire was collapsing. I mean, we're going back in time and immortal. It doesn't matter your ancestors at that point, you've got all the cards needed to fuck shit up 




 It also helps with the calming down thing, especially if you are of the panic disorder type... Also whiskey is tasty 




 For some reason this made me think Eyedea   Abilities Color my World Mine 




 The FUCK? 
























 I'm not reddit but I like the way this one thinks ^ 




 I was expecting Papal lasers and I was sorely disappointed  




 So if my well runs dry and water is a human right, how would that be provided to me? Would the local government have to pay to relocate me to a site with a viable ground water source, or supply me somehow? 




 Wait... The antichrist? Like, offspring of a human and a cabrion demon, revelations style antichrist?

Is this like a common belief among baptists or just a select fringe group? 




 At least Catholics standardize what you eat. My church just used bread (no crust because Jesus doesn't do crust). The one week they ran out of wheat halfway through and switched to rye. Result: you had your choice between white meat Jesus and darkness Jesus. 
























 Ours tossed a blade while crushing ice, shattering the glass container. Also it stained my pants poop 




 And these things are different how? 




 I never understood that. Wtf are they made out of? 




 I am. Tacos are like open ended burritos made out of razor blades. Burritos are so much easier to hold on to. Except if they aren't wrapped well they get soggy by the end 




 Last time I saw them it was:

Rodeo Ruby Love

Streetlight Manifesto

Reel Big Fish

Lost my coat and shoes in the circle pit, found them in the sound booth, made friends with some of the techs and got pulled over at 3am in Camden because my car matched the description of a stolen vehicle. Epic concert and fun times
