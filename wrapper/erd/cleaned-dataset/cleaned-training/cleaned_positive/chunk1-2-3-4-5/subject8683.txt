I have a sexual fetish that is fueled by sexual encounters (touching, kissing, simply looking, etc.) with a woman who is sleeping or unconscious, solely based on the fact that she is sleeping or unconscious. Basically, narcolepsy is my biggest turn-on. If I'm so much as in the same room with a good-looking, sleeping woman, you can bet I'll get a huge boner just from watching her sleep.

I also watch a lot of sleep fetish porn, and I have acted on this fetish in real life (with consent).

Ask me anything. 









 My response: "I'm good, thanks. Yourself?"

My favorite response from someone else: "Not bad for an old man." 









 I've been depressed for at least ten years. I lost the only job I had about a year and a half ago and haven't been able to find work since. I didn't graduate from high school because I was in too shitty of a mood to even go most of the time, and when I did, I couldn't focus.

I've had one girlfriend (who was only with me because she was desperate), and almost my entire family thinks of me as "The one who sits in the dark basement all day and doesn't talk to anyone."

I wanted to be a writer when I was around 13-15 years old (23 now), and I started numerous novels, but never came close to finishing any because I lacked the drive, motivation and commitment needed for something of that nature. I've written a single article for some site you've never heard of, got good feedback on it, but still find myself unable to do anything significant in that regard.

I've been on anti-depressants for two months. I stopped taking them recently because I couldn't afford to pay for them anymore. I felt no different while taking them, and I feel no different quitting them cold turkey.

Anyone else? Anyone at all in this position? Or at least a similar one? 














 You would think, if Hobbes is a real tiger in Calvin's world, he'd take exception or at least say something about it. But he just sort of shrugs it off every time.

Thoughts? 
























 I'm not a virgin-- the one woman I have had sex with gave me no stimulation through intercourse. I didn't feel anything. She felt a lot though. Ask our neighbors _

She gave me oral and handjobs, however, which were amazing. But I never came. I never had an orgasm. I just felt like I was going to explode the whole time, but I never ever came. Not once.

I feel fine. Other than, you know, chronic depression. But my balls feel absolutely fine. I don't get any pain down there or anything.

How is this possible? 




 I had a wet dream last night. Prompted me to make this. I could sort of feel it when it happened, but I was like half asleep (closer to being asleep than awake), so I didn't really do anything. I just let it happen and fell back asleep.

**EDIT:** I am a male. 





































































 Usually, when most people feel butterflies, they become nervous and unable to perform the task at hand (talking to a beautiful woman, playing in a significant sporting event, fighting, etc.) as well as if they didn't have butterflies.

Am I right to assume that most bodily functions such as this occur because of evolutionary traits that were at one time useful? If so, how exactly does this help?

 First off, for reasons I don't think are necessary to discuss, whenever I find a woman who's willing to put up with me, I get *extremely* attached. I'm not the type to constantly call or want to be around a girl, but when I am around her, I smother her. I touch her, I hold her, I tell her to hold me, and I basically give her no room to breathe. I know it's annoying, but I can't help it. It just happens.

On top of that, I'm extremely fucked up psychologically. I'm clinically depressed and possibly bipolar. I'm very sensitive emotionally, which can lead to a lot of conflict in a relationship.

I also hate intercourse. I'd much rather spoon or grope a woman all night long than have sex. Weird, I know. I really have no idea why I am this way. And I'm not assertive in any way in the bedroom. I prefer the woman to be aggressive. Turns out that most women want the opposite.

All in all, almost nothing about me is conducive to a happy, healthy relationship. I used to mope and be angry about this, but I've pretty much accepted my fate as a forever alone.

Is there anyone else out there like this? Or am I *truly* forever alone in this regard? 



























































 I was really close to my cousin-- we're both around the same age (23-25), and he was a really happy, mellow, down-to-earth guy. He made people laugh and didn't bother anyone, and I always loved hanging out with him (and I usually hate being around people in general-- that goes for everyone, even my close family).

I got the news on Sunday, and it's taken me until about a day or two ago to finally be able to handle it and try to live my life normally, but I'm still struggling. I'm afraid that if I go to the funeral, it will just devastate me all over again, and I dread having to feel that pain ever again.

What can/should I do? 




 My friend is playing Madden 13, and he just got an Achievement. When he hit the Xbox guide button to see what it was, I read the description in about a second. He left it up for at least four seconds. 














 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emotions#Parrott.27s_emotions_by_groups

You can choose what's listed as a primary, secondary, or tertiary emotion. Up to you.

I get the feeling that "Longing" might be a popular choice. Maybe some Redditors want to be a super badass and will choose "Compassion" to get back at people who wronged them without regretting it.

Of course, "Sadness" would be a good choice as well, for obvious reasons.

What say, Reddit? 




 In life, you have two options-- die before the people you love, or watch the people you love die, knowing you can do nothing about it.

What a choice. I can't deal with this. I have no idea what the hell to do. I'm considering finding a way to live far away from everyone who knows me, and forging no new relationships with anyone there. I can't go through the grief of losing a loved one again-- I'm too sensitive emotionally. And I can't imagine my family seeing me on an autopsy table, unmoving... dead.

I can't fucking do it. 




 Speaking of himself in a verse that describes a hypothetical "alternate universe," I suppose, in which Marshall Mathers didn't have the will to pursue his rap career.

Full lyrics:

http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bob/airplanespartii.html 




 What do you think he wondered when he viewed the death of another human being? What did he think was the difference between a dead body and a living one? When looking into the sky and seeing stars, and attempting to understand simple concepts like day and night, or abstractions like life and our place in the universe? 









 I'm trying to do anything I can to take my mind off of it, but all I can do is hear my dad's words over and over again in my head.

"James was killed in a car accident..."

"We just came from the morgue..."

"He looked like he was sleeping..."

My cousin and I were as close as brothers. I have no idea how I'm going to possibly deal with this. My body feels like it wants to sob profusely, but I just can't... I feel like I'm going to throw up, but I can't do that, either...

I don't know what to do... please make me feel better. 














 They either happen at completely random times, or when I see/hear/think of something funny or interesting. They get so intense sometimes that I get dizzy and lose my balance (but I haven't actually fallen because of it). At that point, I usually just have to "shake the cobwebs" and it goes away.

You might be thinking that it's not head tingles that I'm feeling, but I've experienced head tingles for a *very* long time (I remember my first one was because of a girl I liked in kindergarten), so I know what they feel like.

It's very weird, but it's sort of an intriguing feeling, because I was not aware at all that ASMR could be this intense.

 Would doorknobs be on the left? Would we drive on the left side of the road instead of the right? 









 I get instantly raged (internally only) whenever I see anyone say the words "my boyfriend" or "my girlfriend," anywhere at all, whether I know the person or not.

Yes, I have a problem. 




 Being wet isn't comfortable, nor is it conducive to sex. It'd be a hassle to clean, the person who's wet would be cold, and the person who's dry would be getting wet needlessly.

Yet, this:

Is considered attractive (even if you don't find the girl in general attractive, stay with me anyway).

Why?

 For example, some people believe that spicy food and junk foods can cause nightmares.

I've noticed that whenever I take sleep aids, I tend to have extremely long, very vivid dreams that I can easily remember when I wake up.

Do you know of anything that you do before going to sleep that affects the content of your dreams, or whether or not you dream at all?

We figured out that using a different charger than the intended = bad. But right now, I'm very short on cash, and I can't afford to buy a new charger unless I'm *positive* that it will help my computer run better.

What think, r/techsupport? 




 I also haven't had any physical contact (let alone intimate contact) with a woman in over a year and a half. I've also never had an orgasm with the exception of frequent nocturnal emissions.

Ask me anything. 














 She has no idea what the key could be for, and she lives by herself-- before she moved in, no one with the name that was on the envelope lived there (previous tenant had been there for at least a decade). The envelope only had the name on it (no address, no stamp), so it was clearly not mailed.

What would you do, Reddit? 














 Or would you be too embarrassed, due to the societal viewpoint that being raped by a woman makes a man look weak? 




 Has this ever happened to anyone else? Am I the only one who has a tendency to mask his depression in public (and apparently do a damn good job of it)? 
























 Society seems to think that if people make much more money than the average person and also appear on television as part of their job, they're somehow above us "normal" people. They get giddy and excited just to see these people, and if a celebrity so much as talks to someone or writes their name down for someone, OMG IT'S AMAZING I CAN'T BELIEVE IT

We treat these people as if they're demigods, then get upset/perplexed when their egos become huge. They're people just like us. They eat, sleep, and shit just like us. They do what they're good at to earn an income just like us.

But apparently, talking to a celebrity or getting an autograph is a big deal, even though there's absolutely no tangible or intangible benefit of doing so. Meeting an actor, a pro athlete, etc., doesn't make someone's life better, but society has brainwashed us into thinking that's the case.

Again, they're just people doing what they're good at to make a living. Nothing more. 









 ... I think. I have no idea, since I've never been drunk or high on recreational drugs before.

I was recently prescribed an antidepressant called "vilazodone" by my doctor, and I started taking them two days ago (today was the third day I've taken it). Ever since I started using them, I've been feeling really, really weird (strange too, considering that I was told, and have heard, that these things take at least a month to work).

Anyway, since taking it for the first time, I feel the strangest combination of the following:

* Slight nausea
* Lightheadedness/dizziness (sometimes feels like my head is "spinning")
* Fatigue
* Horniness

I have no idea if this is normal or not, or even if it's a placebo effect at work, but... it feels sooooooo goooooood... _

I'm not at all concerned or asking for a diagnosis. Just bored and thought maybe someone would find this funny/intriguing. 




 I've heard that, with modern forensics, it's impossible. 









 I went to the doctor's office for an infection in my finger, got that taken care of, and then asked him about possible psychiatric treatments for my depression.

He asked me 7 or 8 questions from a questionnaire about my general emotional state and afterwards, I was prescribed vilazodone and given a starter kit.

I could have easily lied on the questionnaire, considering it was obvious how the questions were structured and how I'd have to answer them to give the impression that I'm depressed.

Am I missing something? 












































 I have a specific make and model (Dell Precision M6400) that I think has problems with overheating in these two areas. I'm already using a laptop cooler, and right now, without really doing anything except surfing the internet, my CPU is at 63 C and the motherboard is at 69 C. When it gets to this point, it has trouble loading any videos at all and it feels extremely hot to the touch (may also be an issue with an overheating graphics card).

What can I do, if anything, to keep it cooler?

Then again, Calvin's such a little rotter that you might feel like ignoring him isn't the worst thing his parents could do o_o 




 I enjoy answering questions about this, so I wanted to field another AMA. I'm kind of bored. Anyways...

Somnophilia is a sexual fetish associated with extreme attraction to a partner who is sleeping or unconscious solely because of the fact that they are sleeping or unconscious. This is not a rape fetish-- taking a partner against his or her will has nothing to do with this.

I watch lots of sleep sex porn (it's the only porn that can keep my attention) and yes, I've fooled around with women as they sleep (with their prior consent).

Ask me anything. 




 What's wrong with reposting the same content in the same subreddit, some time later? It's the only way to expose one's post to more people (and thus get more distinct responses) after the original has died. 




 It feels like my depression and my exercise regiment are constantly clashing. To work out consistently requires energy, willpower, and motivation, all of which the parasite known as depression feeds on. 

Sometimes I'll be fully rested but unable to work out because I don't have one or more of the above necessities. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what can help? 




 Yes, really.

I am more attracted to Beth Phoenix than I have been to any woman in my entire life, and I refuse to settle for admiring from afar.

 http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/18

Things that stood out to me:

-At one point, Calvin (or at least the "real" Calvin combined with the "good" Calvin) smiles for 16 straight panels. I always look for stuff like that (I'm weird), and I can't remember another time he smiled for even four straight panels.

-Hobbes notes at the end of the story arc that Calvin is "The only person [he knows] whose good side is prone to badness." But, Watterson immediately asserts (through Calvin) that it might not have been simply a case of Calvin being so bad that not even the incarnate of his good side can't resist being evil.

Calvin claims that "He could only be perfectly good as an abstraction. In his human manifestation, he wanted to throttle me," implying that simply by being human, it was impossible for "Good Calvin" to be flawlessly benevolent. Watterson was clearly making a point about human nature and perhaps our inability to resist the allure of sin.

This is part of the reason I resent when people disregard Calvin and Hobbes as "just a newspaper comic." Both Watterson and his writing are extremely deep, and his ability to express fundamental truths about things like this, and the world overall, is the reason I've re-read all of the collections at least three times each. 




 I fell for her the moment I laid eyes on The Glamazon. I adore her combination of physical strength and feminine beauty, and I refuse to admire from afar. I'm going after what I want.

Tell me how I can give myself the best chance to be successful. 



























































 I love it when I wake up in the morning and the sun isn't shining, and the sky is gray and cloudy and everything is just as dismal as it can be. 

And I absolutely LOVE rain. The stronger the downpour, the better. Sometimes I open my front door and just stare outside for the entirety of a thunderstorm. The sound the rain makes as it hits the ground, the dreariness, I just go crazy for it.

If your answer is "Yes," why do you think it is? For myself, I imagine it's for two reasons-- one, because I like to see nature matching my own mood (which is usually "Bleh"), and also because that type of weather keeps people from going outside, which I like (I hate people in general). 




 23/M, just got quasi-dumped without even seeing the woman in person. I won't bother with details, since this isn't a blog... we met on Reddit, we clicked almost instantly, we started to fall for one another (as much as two people can who interact only through text), and then she told me that it's "inevitable" that she'll eventually forget about me once school starts.

I could live with being 3,000 miles away from her and probably never getting the chance to ever see her in person. I realized that from the start. But I thought at the very least, we could be long-term internet friends who occasionally send each other naughty messages.

But when she told me that our relationship was basically going to self-terminate in the near future, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I wasn't even mad at her... I was just disappointed at life.

I'm overly emotional for a guy, so it probably hurts a lot more than maybe it would for someone reading this, but I think, no matter what, something like this will almost always be painful.

So, please... if you find someone you like, and they like you back, for the love of all that is holy, **tell him/her not to expect a long-term relationship of any kind if you know that it won't work, for ANY reason at all**. Please. I don't want anyone else to feel like this. 




 I thought it was just silly that people couldn't see Spider-Man when he's on the ceiling. I'm like "He's right there! Just look up!" Then, through my own behavior, I realized that people in general tend to ignore the ceiling when they walk into any given room. There's no reason to acknowledge it-- it's just... there. 




 I met her on Reddit. We live on opposite ends of the country, so being together in person was never a realistic option. Even still, we hit it off. AIM chats full of kisses and 3s and sometimes naughty exchanges when we were feeling horny.

We made each other feel better when we were down and we tried our best to make sure neither of us stayed down for very long. I'm not afraid to say that we may have been falling for one another.

Earlier tonight, though, she told me that soon, we wouldn't be able to talk to me very much, since she starts school soon. I could feel the relationship starting to dissolve as soon as she said that, but I tried to be strong. I asked her to promise to try her best to not forget me, but she said she didn't want to, because it's inevitable.

It hurt badly, and I didn't know what to say. The fact that I didn't respond immediately seemed to worry her-- she said that she felt bad, but I tried to make us both feel better by flirting playfully. Eventually, she remarked that I was hers and hers only. I replied, without thinking, "Until you forget about me." It was a cry for help... I didn't mean it. I just wanted her to make me feel better about it.

She then told me she was going to leave, and even though I literally begged and pleaded, she still signed off. Usually, if I were to say "Please don't leave," she would become sympathetic and lovingly stick around, for me.

This time, she left without even acknowledging my pleas for her not to.

There's a giant knot in my stomach and I feel like my heart has been irreparably torn asunder. I feel like I don't deserve to live for what I may have just done, and I now have no way of contacting her outside of Reddit.

Please, if you're reading this... *please* come back to me. Don't do the unthinkable. I couldn't live with myself... just let me make it better... I promise I can. 









 I'm about 6'4, and I've heard a few women say that they love it when men are as tall as I am. One even responded with "Fuck me now" when I told her how tall I am. I guess maybe I don't see it because I'm used to my height or because almost everyone in my family (and a lot of my friends) are tall. I dunno.

How much do you personally value height, ladies?

**EDIT:** Also, how tall is *too* tall? 




 It's a nice message, but it's not realistic. Humans cannot perfectly manipulate their own emotions and make themselves feel however they want. If they could, no one would ever be sad or angry for more than 2 seconds at a time.

It reminds me of when parents tell their kids they can be whatever they want when they grow up. You don't really mean it-- you just say it so that they'll have confidence to go after what they want. The difference is, we're not kids, so don't treat us like it. Please don't patronize us. 







































 I love it when Calvin is interacting with another character, and through the first three panels, Calvin is visibly upset while the other character continues to bug him. Then, in the last panel, Calvin just explodes with anger.

 ... what's actually happening in Calvin's world in which Hobbes is a real tiger? It's been established that Calvin struggles to keep Hobbes' weight on his shoulders (usually when giving him a boost). So when other characters see Calvin with stuffed-animal Hobbes over his shoulder, is he actually carrying him? 









 I mean, we have the Patterson-Gimlin film in favor of Bigfoot, which still hasn't been completely debunked by science, whereas we have pretty much nothing visual for God or Jesus in that same regard. It seems that a lot more people believe in God than believe in Sasquatch, though.

I hope this post isn't breaking the rules-- just something I always thought about.

 Sports games implement sliders that allow you to tailor the game almost exactly to your liking, and as a result, give yourself a unique experience based on your skill level and style of play.

Shooters and action games only offer different difficulties (as far as I know). If they offered adjustable sliders, like:

* User/AI bullet damage

* User/AI melee damage

* User/AI accuracy

* User/AI speed

etc., I think that these types of games would be a more fun experience for a lot of people. 




 I have a Dell Precision M6400 with a 512MB NVIDIA Quadro FX 2700M. I think there's some sort of issue with the graphics card or the motherboard overheating-- I did some research but wasn't able to find anything definitive.

I had to buy a new charger after the original charger died, and the power brick on the new charger is way smaller than the original. It still fits in the laptop and charges it, but it takes forever to do so, and the laptop itself performs better when it's not plugged in. It never overheats while running on the battery, and I can actually watch 1080i videos without skipping.

I have a laptop cooler on which I constantly keep the laptop, but it still overheats randomly sometimes, but usually when I try to watch any video (it's like 50/50 as far as being able to watch a video without overheating).

When it overheats, it gets approximately as hot as the surface of the sun, and everything just kinda lags and the CPU Usage jumps to 100% and can stay there for minutes at a time. I've never had problems with the laptop shutting down due to overheating, however.

Any tips? 














 I learned that girls have two X chromosomes, and whenever I want to make sure I'm remembering that fact right, I think of this strip:

https://thecomicninja.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/calvin-and-hobbes-x-chromosomes.gif?w=640

Calvin and Hobbes also introduced me to the concept of being avant-garde. I also learned certain words like:

* Theology
* Atrophy
* Somnambulism
* Stupendous (hey, I was young) 




 I've had trouble sleeping for a long time (mostly because of depression and anxiety), so I normally use OTC sleep aids, but I'm short on cash now and didn't have time to buy anymore after running out.

As a result, I've slept for about three hours in the last day and a half. Help me snooze. 









 Somnophilia is a sexual fetish associated with arousal by a sleeping/unconscious partner because of the fact that they *are* asleep/unconscious.

How do you feel about this? Would a fetish of this nature turn you off? Do you know anyone who has it? Do you personally have it (probably a long shot)? Any questions for someone who does (i.e., me)? 




 I've been single for almost a year and a half, and I don't really go out much. I live alone, and it gets lonely here by myself. I'm kinda nerdy (as if that's not a given), and I've got a good, quirky sense of humor. I love talking about myself and my weird personality (but not in a conceited, all-about-me kinda way), and I love listening to others talk about themselves. I really enjoy meeting new people and learning more about them, and I'm not judgmental at all. I just like when people are willing to be themselves, since I'll do the same.

I don't drink or smoke, and stay in the house a lot, but I'm always up for trying new things. Even if you're not in my area (or even in my country), feel free to PM me. I'm down for anything from meetups to casual chats to harmless flirting and anything in between. 




 Xbox 360 w/60 GB hard drive
NBA 2K12 (very good condition)
Madden NFL 12 (very good condition)
Wireless controller w/charger

I've tried finding someone I know, or someone who knows someone I know, to buy it since I'll undoubtedly get more profit from a personal transaction, but no one's budging. What would GameStop give me for this? I'm guessing approximately peanuts. 














 I don't really go out, so I don't have any dressy clothes (my clothes are in good shape, just not very formal). No button-ups, no nice pants (just black jeans), etc. I wouldn't want to go to a club in a t-shirt and jeans... would I? I would say my tees are nice, but a button-up would be better, obviously. I'd buy some collared shirts and stuff if I could, but I'm broke as all hell.

I don't even know if I should go to a bar or a club. I've never been to one in my life and none of my friends will go with me. Maybe I should go somewhere else to meet women (I don't have a job right now and I'm not in school)?

What think, seddit? 




 I'm not going to pretend I'm some sort of sexual god-- I've just never had an orgasm. Everything else is fine. I get it up just fine, but I've never blown a load in my life (and I've some good, long-lasting sex/blow jobs/hand jobs/etc.).

I'm not necessarily asking for just sex or a FWB, but I have been feeling a little horny lately and I could use an outlet. I enjoy going down on women and using my mouth (and my tongue especially) in a lot of ways, so I won't ask you to do all the work. I also live by myself, so roommates/siblings/parents won't be an issue.

I'm a single black male, I stand about 6'3, and I've been told that I have "good hair" (it's curly and soft). I'm kinda slender with a sort of dark mocha complexion I guess. Around the same as Will Smith, I think.

Also, just in case people might not understand what I'm saying, I've never been with a man (I'm not gay, but I'm not homophobic, either). I just said "No woman" in the title to specify.

As I said, I definitely wouldn't mind an actual relationship, but I feel irresponsible if I didn't tell you I was feeling horny, and that's part of the reason I made this post.

Anyways, any ladies who want to see if they can be the first or are looking for a guy to spend time with in the Philadelphia area are free to send me a private message (or respond to this post if you want). 









 I've been terribly depressed for the last ten years, and I think I grew used to it eventually, so I never sought help when I could afford it. I've lost my most recent job since and have been applying for work over the last year and a half and have yet to be even considered by anyone. I have no money saved up and none coming in.

People have suggested to me that certain clinics will offer a sliding scale of payment based on your salary, but I have no salary.

How useful is 2-1-1? Would they be able to help someone in my position?

Any other suggestions? Thank you. 














 Let's say the FWB will be a 10/10, and the boy/girlfriend will be a 7. 




 I'm a 23-year-old male, and like I said, I haven't had any contact, let alone intimate contact, with a woman in a year and a half. I don't masturbate-- I never have, and I never feel a desire to. I get aroused sometimes, obviously, but I never feel the need to masturbate.

I was with my last girlfriend for about a year, and she couldn't make me ejaculate at all. She'd give me blow jobs and hand jobs, and I'd get erections, but I would never orgasm at all. During intercourse, I could make her cum, but not the inverse. I don't know if I don't like vagina or just didn't like hers. I haven't had sex with any other woman.

I've never felt an actual orgasm in my life, although I can say without a doubt that I've had wet dreams. How recently? I just woke up from one.

I thought everything I just described (i.e., no source of sexual release-- at least while awake) would lead to blue balls, but I don't think I have it. Is my body just compensating with the nocturnal emissions? Is living this way unhealthy (it doesn't really bother me at all)? I don't feel repressed sexually or anything. 









 I've had no luck at all even getting called in for any interviews-- the only times I did, I realized they were scams.

I have four years of work experience as an administrative assistant at the University of Pennsylvania, and I mostly apply to secretarial positions, but no one even considers hiring me. I use monster.com and Craigslist for the most part.

I've even gone to every place of business within about a mile of my house (no car), and they didn't get back to me. I've gone to my local mall... nothing.

Any advice?

 I use [this laptop cooler](http://archive.benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content task=view id=688 Itemid=66 limit=1 limitstart=2), and it helps a little, but my laptop still get pretty hot to the touch (only on the speakers above the keyboard, which is where I assume the processors are). 

According to Core Temp (a program I use to monitor the processor temperatures, the highest I usually go is about 65-68° C. I don't think that's really gonna damage the computer, but I also use a couple of high-end programs (mostly for video editing), so keeping it cool would help a lot for that. Plus I just hate the feel of a hot laptop, especially in the summer.

I'm really strapped for cash so I can't buy much of anything to help. What can I do to at least mitigate this issue? 














 I can barely convert a 5-minute video file without my processor damn near hitting 90° C (it's Intel Duo Core if that matters). I'm scared my computer will burst into flames (hyperbole alert) if I try to convert a file that's one or two hours long

Any advice? 




 Since I spend 12 hours a day in a room with no light (I live by myself, in the basement of a two-story house), eat crappy food since I never have the energy or will to actually cook, never have friends over, and I go outdoors maybe once a week, only for 3-5 minutes at a time.  


Plus the fact that every day is pretty much just me doing anything I can to keep from going insane and make it until tomorrow without losing my shit. He said that sounds like the life of someone serving time.  

And I think he's right.

 To start, my laptop is a Dell Precision M6400 workstation. It's pretty powerful compared to the average laptop, so I expected a little bit of overheating here and there, but it's really bad now, even with my CM Storm laptop cooler.

I recently replaced my charger and battery (thanks to help from r/techsupport), after I had been using a lower wattage AC adapter for a while (because the original one died). The replacement adapter was only 90W where as the new one I just purchased (and the original) were 210.

When I was using the 90W adapter, the computer didn't overheat as much as it is now, which, ironically, is the reason I bought the new charger to begin with. I thought the stronger adapter would lessen the overheating, but it's actually gotten worse.

I haven't been doing much. Using the internet with 4-6 tabs open, no embedded videos (like YouTube and the like), no high-end programs idling in the background. Usually only Notepad, Windows Explorer, internet browser, AIM, YIM, Task Manager, and uTorrent are open at one time. Sometimes iTunes as well, and the CPU usage is consistently remaining extremely low (low single-digits). Despite this, the 
laptop is hot to the touch (on the speakers, which are located [above the keyboard](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/09/m6400-precision-dell.jpg)). I've also got 99.9 GB free on my C drive and 49 free on my E drive (capacity 465 GB individually). 

[Here are my specs](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png).

How can I keep my laptop from overheating?

Thanks. 














 I use either a program called "Any Video Converter," or "4Videosoft MKV Video Converter."

The converted file (usually to MP4, so I can watch it on my Xbox 360-- usually being converted from MKV or AVI) always ends up way bigger than the original file. Is it the program? Is it the video types?

I'm having a problem finding an AC adapter, though. This one:

http://www.discountelectronics.com/product?product_id=6631 product_model=302

Is the one listed under "Dell Precision 6400." However...

http://www.discountelectronics.com/product?product_id=4505 product_model=315

This one looks exactly like the one the laptop came with, and the first one is definitely not the one the laptop came with.

What do I do?

**NOTE:** I posted this last night, but got no responses. I apologize if re-posting so soon is against the rules, but I need this fixed as soon as possible.

 Anyone who's taken it/is taking it, how did it affect you? 







































 What do these options, found under Power Options -- Advanced Settings -- Processor Power Management, mean? I tried Googling it, but I had a hard time understanding how people were explaining it since I now next to nothing about advanced computer hardware.

Could someone possibly put it in layman's terms for me? 














 Obviously, being a major secret means you probably don't know the true story, so most responses will probably be in the form of "The real reason _______ happened," or "What really happened at __________." 




 And when I say it "goes out," I don't mean that my modem/router doesn't pick up a connection. It still does, and I'll stay connected to my wireless network on my laptop, but web sites won't load. However, if I have something running that runs perpetually and doesn't have to be reloaded (like Xbox Live, instant messenger programs, torrents, etc.), they will stay connected to the internet (i.e., torrents will still download, I can still send/receive IMs, can still play games online, etc.).

When this happens, nothing on my router/modem changes. All the lights are lit, and it shows that I'm connected to the internet.

Does anyone know why this might be happening and how I can fix it? 




 How can you owe this amount, and all of a sudden you owe less?

Sorry if this sounds stupid; I know next to nothing about finances.

 I can already stream music that's on my laptop, and listen to it on my 360. How would I go about doing the same with video?

Thanks in advance. 




 When I use VLC media player to play the .m2ts/.ts files I have on my computer, it just shows "00:00" no matter how long the video is. I also can't skip back and forth through the video with the "Forward/backwards five/ten seconds" commands. It doesn't do this with any other video format.

Is there any way to fix this? The files I have are very big (1 GB at the smallest), so I want to avoid having to convert them to another video format if possible.

Thanks. 









 I use the term "herp-derp" in the title because, like always, I try to use humor to heal the situation, but it is serious.

The only way I can describe it is this: I feel sadness and depression like everyone (I've been really depressed for about ten years, but that's not the most important part), but... when I feel (or SHOULD feel) happiness, it doesn't feel like happiness. It feels like a different type of sadness. Stronger and more pronounced. Like I'm going to cry, but I **know** it's not from being saddened or depressed.

I feel this when things in my life are going perfect and couldn't be better. Right now is a good example. I just came into some money, I may have finally gotten some anti-depressants that work, and I have literally nothing in my life to worry about.

So why do I feel like sobbing? Why does this happen EVERY TIME that I should be jumping for joy and grinning ear-to-ear? Is this normal? Is there something wrong with my brain that triggers a "sadness" reaction to a "happiness" stimuli? Can this be fixed?  









 Lol

Like that. 
























 I have a couple of hobbies that I really enjoy, which are video games and video editing. Right now, I have nothing to do for the rest of the night, and instead of indulging myself in either of these activities, I can't find the will to do much other than pace back and forth across the room or sit on the edge of my bed literally doing nothing else.

Sucks. 



















 EDIT: Or really, any type of numerical or letter label that isn't what it appears. For example, different mediums have given varying representations of the "S" on Superman's chest. In the 1978 movie, it's described as the coat of arms of the House of El. 












































 I've been trying to wrap my head around this concept for a long time, and I got nothin.

Help me out. 




 Nature generally does its best to give a species good reason to continue reproducing, right? That's why sex feels so good, why we're attracted to certain people, etc.

If that's the case, why is childbirth so painful for women? Isn't that completely counterintuitive to what nature usually dictates? It could essentially be a logical reason for women to NOT want to give birth-- nature usually makes sure to, at the very least, not give someone a reason to not reproduce. 





























 Apparently, the word "Theory" is closer to the typical use of the word "Law" than "Theory."

 I'll focus on the [Patterson-Gimlin film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOxuRIfFs0w) a little bit, plus some basic zoology. If I'm wrong about anything, or you disagree with something ambiguous, feel free to say so. I don't necessarily believe everything I list below-- I'm just taking what I've heard and throwing it out there for you guys to go after in any way you see fit.

For:

* The alleged suit used in the P-G film has never turned up, even after 45 some odd years
* Many men have claimed to be "the guy in the suit," and their stories all contradict one another (although honestly, fake or not, this might be expected)
* In the P-G film, the alleged creatures has arms nearly as long as its legs, completely unlike a human, even one in a suit
* Some claim that if you look closely at the forehead, you can see the crest moving up and down, which would be indicative of muscles and skin, not rubber
* Some claim that Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin simply did not have the resources to pull off such a massive, long-lasting hoax
* Some claim that the alleged creature seen in the P-G film walks in such a way that would be almost impossible for a human in a suit to replicate

Against:

* A minimal breeding population of large primates would have to number in the thousands, and if that's the case, there's very little chance that they could escape detection, especially for this long
* Primates do not swing their arms when they walk like in the P-G film
* There is no fossil evidence of anything that would fit the description of what we know as Bigfoot or Sasquatch
* Bodies are never found, nor is fecal matter
* Nests, colonies, etc. are also never seen or discovered
* Apes do not hibernate during cold winters, and as a result, it would be nearly impossible for a Bigfoot to survive an entire northwestern United States winter 




 How do you all feel about it? Fake? Real? A guy in a suit?

I've seen cases made for both sides, and I wanna hear what the members of this subreddit have to say on the subject. 














 But it's not why you think. Well, it might be.

I used to be the type of guy who would talk to random good-looking women in public at the drop of a hat. You know "Hey, how you doing?", make small talk, attempt to get phone number. I was almost always woefully unsuccessful, but I generally didn't get discouraged.

Anyways, eventually, I realized that I had to draw the line at some point. So the fact that I had very little success, plus the fact that I know I'd make a shitty boyfriend anyway, made me decide to stop coming onto women at all.

Anyways, I was walking home from the store today, and I saw a cute chick. She wasn't super hot or anything, but she'd have been worth talking to if I didn't have my personal decision not to do so. We were both standing at the corner, trying to cross a busy intersection, but the traffic took a while to slow down enough for us to get across the street.

Of course, me being stupid, I couldn't help myself.

I said "This intersection could use another stop sign, couldn't it?" and smiled slightly. I don't know why I said it, but I do know that I had absolutely no desire to try and sweet-talk her.

But nobody told my brain, apparently. Because at that point, she agreed and laughed, at which point we were both able to cross the street. I walked back the way I was going and didn't pay her any attention, but I felt sick to my stomach that I didn't take the opportunity to hit on her. This was over an hour ago, and I still feel like crap.

tl;dr- [This](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3rbso0/) is what happens if I interact in any way with any attractive woman ever.

Fuck you, scumbag brain.

**EDIT:** Well, at least I can use this situation to confirm that I'm definitely forever alone. It's good to know.

You're okay, scumbag brain. 




 These videos are clips that I've recorded from my television with a capture device.

Not only am I a little (read: a lot) over my head with the sheer number of files I've recorded, but they also are all in 1080i high definition. My computer isn't built to play that type of video smoothly, so watching them at all is a chore and it's almost impossible to do so without significant skipping.

Does anyone have any advice for how I should go about this?

Thanks. 



















 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnophilia

Ask me anything that you can think of about this. Nothing's off limits. 



















 I live in the Philadelphia area and just want a psychiatric assessment and medical diagnosis. I don't need therapy or counseling or anything.

I tried using Google, but I couldn't find anything. Maybe someone who's more experienced with this can help. 









 For example, a police officer. Say a cop pulled over a woman because her car matches the description of a vehicle they're looking for. Turns out, wrong car.

The cop flirts with the woman and gives her his phone number (not taking forever to do, so that he can get back to patrolling), all while being recorded on the dash cam. Would he be reprimanded? 














 Plus, I got a good laugh from the doctor after the procedure. I told him I understand why they say you shouldn't drive, but I feel like I could walk home or take a bus. He responds, "Well, some people get drunk and think they can beat up Mike Tyson. That's how you sound right now."

I couldn't help but laugh out loud. 









 I've never blacked out for any reason, and my last girlfriend used to black out randomly... it sort of piqued my interest, because she'd always be able to tell me right before it happens.

Educate me, Reddit. 




 I mean the type of depression where you rarely feel any semblance of happiness. How does it feel to be "cured"? What's it like? 














 Apparently, one can be arrested for animal cruelty if he/she cooks or attempts to cook a cat or dog, but not other animals such as lobsters.

What's the difference? Am I missing something? 




 I have this constant paranoia that something strange happening means I'm coming down with dementia or psychosis. 




 I'm no psychopharmacologist or anyone who'd be considered halfway knowledgeable in this field.

I have to take over-the-counter sleep aids for my insomnia (which I haven't been "officially" diagnosed with-- I just know I have trouble sleeping without sedatives), and I have been doing so regularly for at least two years.

The maximum recommended dosage of diphenhydramine HCL (the main active ingredient) is 50 MG. I took 100 MG all at once about two hours ago (my body's built up a tolerance). I feel slightly sleepy.

I don't want to keep doing this because I feel like it could become dangerous (although I haven't started hallucinating yet, which I understand is the main side effect of an overdose).

If I get treated successfully for depression, will my insomnia wear off too, if it's a result of depression? 



















 There have been certain times where my success rate increased/decreased in a certain environment (or maybe based on some other deviation).

Ask me anything. 









 I'm speaking of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City.

The combat system I mentioned is how the game engine allows you to dodge and counter enemy attacks in real time with specific animations for doing so, as opposed to having generic "Block" and/or "Roll" options.

Which next-gen games have combat systems like this?

Thanks. 




 For example, I wear jeans like lots of people do, but I only wear black jeans. 














 Background info:

I'm not a virgin, although I have only had sex with one woman (multiple times). I think she wasn't very good, because I didn't feel anything at all whenever we had intercourse.

She gave very good oral, but no matter how close I was to the point of orgasm/ejaculation, I could never cross the threshold so to speak. I never came. Not once.

As for the title, yes, I specified "while awake" since I have frequent wet dreams.

I also don't masturbate, but I get aroused and horny like one would expect. I watch sleep fetish porn (I have somnophilia-- a fetish for sleeping/unconscious women).

I found some really good material tonight after I started to look for more since I couldn't sleep (that's gotta be ironic somehow). While I was watching, I was getting closer to the point of orgasm than I usually get while watching porn, but I still didn't think I'd cum.

Then, all of a sudden, it happened. It was (obviously) a feeling I'd never experienced before, and it caught me off guard. I was basically going O_O the whole time.

Ask me anything.

 I know Watterson has said that he doesn't think of Hobbes as either a doll who comes to life when only Calvin is around, nor a stuffed animal who's only real from Calvin's perspective. But I see evidence that, in my opinion, **Hobbes is a stuffed animal whose personality, in the sense of Calvin's imagination, represents Calvin's moral, rational, conservative side**. I'll explain why below.

Throughout the entire Calvin And Hobbes series, Hobbes doesn't once address Calvin's parents. This is because Calvin, essentially (according to my theory, which I'm by no means citing as fact), is both Calvin AND Hobbes. He can't talk to his parents as "Hobbes" because he's too busy being "Calvin."

Speaking of Hobbes interacting with people other than Calvin... not even Calvin's **duplicates** acknowledge Hobbes' existence. You would think that if Hobbes was a real tiger in any way, shape or form, Calvin's clones would be able to talk to him and view him as a real tiger.

Also consider this-- whenever (even though it rarely happens) we see Hobbes writing, his handwriting is eerily similar to Calvin's. This is what first tipped me off that "Real tiger" Hobbes and Calvin are basically the same person.

Hobbes also disagrees with a lot of Calvin's plans, but goes along with them anyway. Hobbes actually likes girls, unlike Calvin, but yet he's still the First Tiger and "El Presidente" of GROSS. Many fans have speculated that Calvin secretly has a crush on Susie-- perhaps he expresses this through Hobbes.

Some might argue, "Don't you remember how Calvin said that Hobbes can climb to the tree fort where they hold their GROSS meetings, and Calvin himself can't?" This is a good point. As silly as it sounds, I honestly think Calvin just throws Hobbes up into the fort, which would explain how he can reach the fort "without climbing." When we [actually see](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/07/26) Hobbes attempt to climb a tree, he's unable to.

Hobbes also shares many of Calvin's opinions and "knowledge," despite the two being so different on the surface. Hobbes helps Calvin cheat in class at least once (despite Hobbes being morally upstanding for the most part), he does his homework and gets the answers just as wrong as Calvin, if not worse (once answering "Atlanta, Georgia" to a subtraction problem), and he believes in Santa Claus.

You'll also notice that Hobbes almost NEVER refers to Calvin by name. Everyone else in the strip does-- Susie, Mom, Dad, Miss Wormwood, Moe, even the principal of Calvin's school. But not Hobbes. Because why would Calvin refer to himself by name? Calvin, however, *does* refer to Hobbes by name on a regular basis.

Like I said, I know a lot of people might feel like I'm "devaluing" the strip by formulating and writing up this theory, and you're certainly entitled to that opinion. But I'd ask that you don't drag this post down by making excessively negative comments.

Thank you. 




 I also am not a virgin, and I have frequent wet dreams (they don't even have to be sex dreams when my body decides to unload while I'm sleeping).

I feel the need to make one of these every time my body reminds me how strange I am by making me wake up wet and sticky.

Ask away. Nothing's off limits. 



















 My friend just told me that an attractive woman was working at the store across the street from my house. I had to loan my Debit card to my dad (long story), so I only had three bucks in cash. I needed bread anyway, so I figured I'd buy a loaf and make a move while I paid for it. In, out, easy.

I get to the store, find out that they're $3.39 each (but also buy one, get one free, so eh). After asking the attractive girl in question and realizing I didn't have enough cash, I had to go back to the house and grab 50 cents in quarters.

I figured it was okay, though. She held on to the loaf of bread, so now I have an excuse to get in her line as opposed to another one. I grab another loaf of bread and wait in her line.

Then one of her co-workers opens another line. I offer to let the person in front of me go first so that I could stay in the line I was in, but he had a full cart and I only had one loaf of bread. Then I tried to use the "But [attractive girl] has my other loaf of bread. She's holding it hostage," and gave a forced laugh.

Her co-worker, totally oblivious to what I was trying to do (understandably-- she had no way to know), cheerfully said "Oh, that's okay!" and took the first loaf of bread from the girl I had gone to talk to. So now I was stuck in this new line, and had to leave the store without even coming close to making a move, AND I looked kinda stupid/poor/both for not having more than three dollars in cash on me.

**tl;dr-** Went to store across the street to talk to hot chick and buy bread. Didn't have enough for bread. Had to go back home to get more. She ended up not even ringing me up. 



















 Possibly misattributed, but a good quote nonetheless in my opinion. 
























 Is this indicative of how ancient man perceived right-handedness as "normal" and left-handedness as uncouth? 




 I watch sleep fetish porn (i.e., porn with "sleeping" girls being fucked), and in at least half of the videos I've seen, the guy tricks the girl into taking sleeping pills, which promptly knock her completely unconscious within about 3 minutes.

I take sleep aids every night for insomnia, and not only do they not put you in a state of complete blackout to the point that a man can ravage you sexually without you awakening, but they take at least a half hour before you even START to feel anything. 














 I went to the store and noticed an attractive young lady working the cash register. I smiled at her, made small talk, and paid for my items. As I was leaving, I doubled back and asked if I could take her out for coffee. She smiled and said yes, but seemed hesitant. 

I told her that she didn't sound as if she was sure of her answer. Then, sort of randomly, she said "This is kind of inappropriate..." I asked her how so. She quickly changed the subject and said "I don't even like coffee!"

I calmly told her that she didn't have to actually get coffee if we went out. At this point, she said "Sure, we can go to Starbucks one day." Almost as if she was trying to get rid of me. But she said yes, so I asked for her phone number. She asked me to get it from one of my friends who had been in the store with me, but who had left before I doubled back to talk to her.

I could tell something was wrong, so I just told her I'd come back later. 

My friend was waiting outside, and he said he'd hook me up.

Sure enough, later that night, he came by later, along with her and a couple other people. We hung out for a little while and played cards, but eventually, me and the girl got in an argument because she said something about her boyfriend. I took exception because I felt that she was wrong for saying yes to me when I asked her out if she's with someone.

She claimed that she "liked my approach" so much that she just instinctively agreed to go out with me. I was confused and a little annoyed, because I felt like if you're with someone, you don't just forget that you have a boy/girlfriend. You just say "No thank you, I'm in a relationship right now."

I felt like I was being led on unfairly.

What think, Reddit? 









 This is the first time in an extremely long time that I've ever felt un-depressed for a long period of time. I had five friends over-- nothing huge. It wasn't a giant party or anything. But they smoked and drank (I did neither-- you can have fun without those things), we played cards for a little while... hell, me and one of the girls got in a little bit of an argument, but by the end of night, we hugged and made up (at her request, even).

Anyways, through all my rambling, the point is that I had fun. I'm not a social person. I would never call myself that and neither would anyone who knows me. Being alone is usually the only time I can say I'm close to being happy, and I think that this probably applies to a lot of people here. 

What I'm saying is that you might, just might, have a good time if you hang out with the right people. If you don't like to have jokes played on you or to be ribbed/talked about by your friends, even in a sort of friendly way, don't put yourself around those types of people.

Find guys (or girls, or both) that you get along well with and who won't start any problems. People that will be mellow and won't ruin your good time. People who will make sure you're enjoying yourself and not let you stay depressed.

tl;dr- Socialize with the right people. There's a good chance that you'll enjoy yourself, and you won't feel depressed. 









 She's constantly nice to Calvin, she wants to spend time with him and lets him in her house even though he almost always treats her like crap.

I can't believe I didn't realize this sooner. 




 The only thing I can remember is a huge blizzard we had in Philadelphia in the early 90s I think. 36 or so inches of snow.

I didn't care because I stayed in the house all day anyway. 




 I listen to mostly rap music. I live in "the hood." I know people who sell drugs (and I know a little about the drug game). I've stared down the wrong end of a revolver and was once the owner of a shotgun (although I never had to so much as load it).

And I'm also a huge internet nerd. Ask me stuff.

 My first "girlfriend" (although she'd probably say otherwise since the relationship was so short) once saw a good-looking girl around my age working the register while we were shopping for clothes. The girl I was with knew that I have no qualms about making small talk with hot women in public, so we had this doozy of a conversation:

* Her: Don't talk to that cashier when we get to the counter.
* Me: And what if I do?
* Her: Then I might have to cut her eyes out.
* Me: O_O...

So of course, when we got to the front, I talked to her anyway. I didn't flirt-- I was just making small talk. "Hey, how are you," that sort of thing. I even made her laugh when I remarked about Mondays being terrible or something or another.

Anyway, the girl I was with leaned up and whispered in my ear, harshly, "What did I tell you?"

I didn't say anything. I was laughing hard on the inside, though. Then I decided to give her a test, since I knew she wasn't one for public displays of affection:

* Me: Put your arm around me.
* Her: ... no.
* Me: Do it, or I'm gonna start talking to her again.

At this point, she put a death grip on my arm that I will never forget. I was shocked, amazed and flattered at the same time.

I also knew I had to break it off with this crazy bitch. 
























 My roommate is on the phone right now with some girl, talking about "taking care of her" because apparently she's sick or something. So far, he's lied about his age, height, and relationship status (he has a "girlfriend" who he cheats on regularly).

I think if I wasn't making this post, I would have leapt up and screamed "SHUT THE FUCK UP!" by now.

If I'm on a diet (especially an unwilling one), don't eat sweets around me. 




 I was in math class about 6 or 7 years ago (I was around 16), and I sat behind a girl I really, really liked. She was very pretty, but she was actually a grade ahead of me, so I was even more scared to talk to her than usual. One day after the bell rang, she started talking to one of my (few) friends, and when the girl I liked looked at me, I knew my friend had told her I liked her.

She walked over to me, and of course, my heart was ready to leap out of my chest. She asked me with a smile, "Do you really want to ask me out?"

I said, "Yeah, but you'd never go on a date with me..."

She responded, "How do you know if you don't ask?", still smiling.

I hesitated, looked into her eyes, and sighed. "Would you like to go out with me?"

She continued to smile and simply said, "I'd love to."

I melted. 














 I've signed up for FetLife and joined this group:

https://fetlife.com/groups/6837

But I figure the more communities I find, the better my chances of finding a woman with whom to fulfill this fetish. 




 I can't find anything on the site itself (or the Wiki page-- I am very new to the site in all fairness, however).

Has anyone met someone on FetLife, or know someone who's done so?

Thanks. 









 My doctor prescribed me a brand of anti-depressants about two months ago. The first few doses were small, so my body could acclimate gradually. Taking it for the first time made me feel high (in a psychoactive way, not in a "The opposite of low, I'm super happy" way). Didn't make me feel "un-depressed," though.

As my system got used to the effects, they lessened until I stopped feeling anything from them at all. I was still depressed, even taking doses that were four times larger than when I started (40 MG compared to 10 at the beginning).

I stopped taking them cold turkey about a week ago because I couldn't afford to pay for them anymore. I feel no different now than I did while I was taking them, nor compared to before I first took them.

I'm looking into counseling, which could lead to better treatment, but I've been depressed for like 10 years. I'm convinced it's too late for me, so I shouldn't even bother.

Thoughts? 









 A representative just came to my door, gave me a gift basket, paid me a $20 "incentive," and bought me and my roommate pizza for participating. Everything seemed absolutely legit-- he left plenty of paperwork explaining everything, a business card, didn't make us pay anything or ask for personal information like a social security number.

Ask me anything. 




 I find myself having to create the same post multiple times if I want more feedback on it. This would avoid that, especially since doing so sometimes gets you bombarded with "REPOST" comments. 







































 This is easier. Besides, I have a 65" rear projection television that isn't going anywhere any time soon.

Go ahead, make fun of me for not having a flatscreen. 




 Wouldn't the Dayman be better? He's a master of karate and friendship. 




 Tried it. 




 .... dude. Give me some useful advice or GTFO.

Everyone knows you can't trust a pilgrim. He'll just steal all my land. 




 He's somewhere in the far corner of the basement, near the back of the house. The only way I could get anything into the area between the   basement ceiling and the floor is a vent on the first floor, which isn't near where he is, or a small opening on the opposite side of the basement.

There aren't any openings or vents or anything in or near where this little bastard is camping out. I don't wanna just spray that area and he responds like "Bitch, please." 




 It's the only room that doesn't let in sunlight during the day. I hate light. 




 I don't own any :-( 




 I live alone in a two story house. My bedroom is in the basement, and Jiminy Cricket appears to be between the basement ceiling and the first-story floor.

There's no way I can get up there to track him down, and if he chirps one more time, I'm gonna burn this goddamn house to the ground.

Any tips?

Thanks. 




 I *still* don't know what the actual Morpheus quote is that his meme is based on. 




 I have a shit-load of video files in my Vuze's Xbox 360 library, and I want to be able to separate them within Vuze. Maybe create folders to put them in. Is that possible? 




 What was the actual quote from the movie that was misconstrued in the making of this meme? 




  -Cliche question, but is your dad confidence/brave enough to pull up to a street ball game in the hood and wager to win?

I assume you mean during his time as a pro athlete? 




 Very good question. I'm eager to hear his answer to this one.

Keep em coming, guys. These questions are really intriguing. 




 Amongst players, or people in general? 




 Just NBA, or NBA, NCAA, on the streets, etc.? 




 In the next couple of days at the very least. I hope that's not too late. If so, I guess I can re-post this. 




 That's gonna be a fun one. Can't wait to ask him that the next time I see him. 




 Could you elaborate more? Do you mean as in when he started playing seriously and developing his skills, or just when he started shooting around on milk crates as a pre-teen? 




 _____________

Maybe I should have titled this "AMAA." 




 Backstory if you want:

From Philadelphia, played for the Boston Celtics for only one year before a knee injury. Wasn't as good after his knee was repaired, so he played overseas (mostly in Argentina) for roughly 10 years.

Went to Rutgers Camden in New Jersey, shattered pretty much every basketball record that ever existed there, and is the only player alumus to be drafted by the NBA.

He's about 6'5, I (24M) go about 6'4, and he's about to turn 60. Why this seemingly random information? To let you know that despite being damn near three times my age... I can't beat him one-on-one. He plays every day at the crack of dawn and has the best jump shot I've ever seen in person. If you've never seen an NBA player just shoot around casually (even way past his prime), it's absolutely amazing. They're pretty much superhumans compared to us, even guys like my dad who weren't superstars.

So go ahead. AMA!

**EDIT:** A minor caveat. I did say "AMA," but there are some questions that he might not be willing to answer, so if that's the case, I'll just tell the person who asked.

Basically, I'm saying all questions are fair game, but I can't guarantee he'll answer them all. 




 Ah, okay.

Thanks again. 




 What do you mean? 




 Thanks for the hasty response.

If I take in the actual cooler, do you think they'd be able to match up an adapter for it? 




 I am broke as all hell and can't shell out the money for a can of compressed air. I've even asked people I know if they have one I can borrow, and no dice.

Is this safe or no?

Thanks, guys. 




 I don't know if you even remember this message, but I was looking into 12vdc cables to replace the one on my [laptop cooler](http://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Laptop-Cooling-Turbine-SGA-4000-KKNF1/dp/B004G603E2) that shorted out, like you had recommended.

Did a quick [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=12vdc ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8 aq=t rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official client=firefox-a channel=fflb) and a whole bunch of stuff came up. Will any cord work? If not, how do I make sure I get the right one?

Thanks. 




  Are all the files contained within a single folder or are you trying to identify duplicates across multiple folders?

Many, many folders (hundreds), across two internal hard drives.

 Are you considering all traits of a file when identifying duplicates? Ie. if you have two documents which are identacle in every way except the filename of one is Document.docx and the other is Document (1).docx, are they still considered duplicates?

The program I use, Digital Volcano's Duplicate Cleaner, can search for:

* Same file name
* Same content
* Same artist/title/album (audio)
* Same size
* Same created date
* Same modified date

 What duplicate-finder programs have you already tried which seem to be so slow?

See above.

**EDIT:** For what it's worth, I wouldn't mind doing this in segments as opposed to all at once. I know I can break it down and tell the program to only check for duplicates in such-and-such a folder, or time period, or file size, etc., but that might exclude files that aren't in the search parameters that actually are duplicates. 




 Most duplicate-finder programs take an extremely long time to scan all of my files (which is understandable, since I have so many). Is there any way or any program that's made to find duplicate files on large hard drives in an efficient manner?

Thanks. 




 Sorry if this seems like a silly question to people with more knowledge than I have, but I just don't get it. 




 Yeah, that's fine. No rush.

Thanks. 




 Will you be on in a few hours? I might not be able to test this right now. 




 Ah, I gotcha. [Here's what I got under "Show Statistics."](http://4.imgland.net/IKGUct.png) 




  I would try OpenDNS' IPs just to check (208.67.222.222; 208.67.220.220), and maybe remove the IPv6 DNS settings.

So I should set those IP addresses under my IPv4? And how exactly do I remove the IPv6 DNS? Just choose "Obtain DNS server address automatically"?

 Also, are those settings in your router what Comcast told you to use? I would use (Get dynamically from ISP) unless told otherwise.

I changed it to static in an attempt to [fix a problem I had connecting to online games over Xbox Live.](http://www.pcworld.com/article/242961/how_to_open_up_nat_settings_on_your_xbox_360.html) But I still had the problem in the OP before changing it.

 EDIT: Also, just a minor niggle, probably nothing: Set DNS through EITHER the computer's or the router's settings (preferably the latter).

If I do it through the router, should I just leave everything under "Network and Sharing" (on my laptop) at default or "Obtain automatically from ISP" or whatever? 




 You mean as in, if I had my laptop connected directly to the modem? I haven't tried that, but will do if nothing else works. 




 * [LAN](http://4.imgland.net/E5ddl5.png)
* [WAN](http://4.imgland.net/JTRijW.png)
* [Router status](http://4.imgland.net/mF6jax.png)

I wasn't sure exactly where to go, so I figured I'd just give these a shot. Hopefully one of them is right. If not, would you mind telling me exactly where to find the connection info you referred to? 




 Should I post a cap of my proxy settings? 




 First, initial basics-- Comcast provides my internet, and I use the internet on my laptop with a wireless connection via router.

The router and modem are no more than ten feet away from my laptop at all times, which (I believe) eliminates the possibility of a weak signal (plus the fact that whenever I check the properties of my connection, the signal strength is maxed out).

This also allows me to constantly monitor the status of my connection by looking at the router/modem-- whenever my internet stops working, everything is the same as when it is working. Connection lights are lit, all status lights are green and not blinking, etc. The "wireless connection" logo in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen also stays the same (no yellow triangle with the ! inside).

To specify what I mean when I say my internet "goes out": At random times during the day (I have yet to figure out any type of pattern), web pages won't load, and internet-based programs/devices (instant messenger, torrents, Xbox Live, etc.) will not connect to the internet. However, if any of those programs are *already* running when the internet goes out, they'll continue working; but if I close the program and tried to start it back up during the down time, it won't work. Hope I explained that well. Pretty much, anything that runs perpetually and doesn't have to be reloaded (unlike websites) will continue to work even during this down time.

I attempted to change my IP addresses with [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#setup). Here are some screencaps of my settings:

* [IPv4 settings](http://2.imgland.net/a97T--.png)
* [IPv6 settings](http://2.imgland.net/sje9LH.png)
* [Connection details](http://2.imgland.net/0p-n45.png)
* [Connection status](http://2.imgland.net/I5Dvl0.png)
* [Basic settings (via router interface page)](http://3.imgland.net/f3F5a0.png)

Any help would be appreciated. If you need any more info, feel free to let me know if I left something out. 




 I think Insanity Wolf saw this and pissed himself. 




 Okay. 'Murica?

I thought that maybe there's some kind of official process that the majority of the world uses. 









 I have videos (MKV and M2TS, mostly) that are anywhere from 1-3 gigs in size, and I need to convert them to MP4 (or AVI, I think) format so I can stream them to my Xbox 360. I used this program at the behest of a user on this subreddit, and it worked much better than software I had used in the past. It generally takes no longer than 10 minutes to convert (since it doesn't reconvert or transcode if it's in H264 already) despite the fact that most of my files are at least an hour long.

MkvtoMp4 converts M2TS files fine-- no issues with the sync of the audio and video. Converting MKV files, however, is a different story entirely. Every time, the audio is always about two seconds ahead of the video. I've tried changing certain settings, but nothing has worked so far. I've used search engines to troubleshoot, but haven't had any success.

Does anyone know a possible solution, or perhaps an alternative piece of software?

Thanks. 




 All while pretending that if you don't do everything in time, the refrigerator door will slice your arm off, right? 




 If you open it less than halfway, my refrigerator door closes slowly, like gravity is pulling it.

But now that you mention it, I do not how it does that o_o 




 If not, I'm a weirdo, and I can live with that. 




 This thread didn't go as well as I'd hoped... 




 Store owner: Go away! Stop holding door! You let flies in! 




 How are there over 1,000 people who felt such disapproval with this thread that they couldn't even ignore it and go on with their day, and instead took time out of their browsing to actually downvote the submission? 




  You can't do it externally; you can't set some kind of option to control the pace of the game, but the pace can change over time.

Yeah, I didn't mean like that. I just meant, for example, if someone's rushing you constantly, you can use counters and/or powerful attacks to keep distance between yourself and your opponent and make them play at your pace. 




 "Damn, bitch. That's a shitty tattoo."

"It's a picture of Jesus."

"... fuck." 




 Yeah, but most fighting games generally have a constant pace that it's "supposed" to be played at, right? Like, you can't turn a match into a slow, methodical, systematic fight, or a fast-paced, offense-oriented, depending on what you're good at/what you prefer.

Can you? 




 Now, is he saying he'd encase the immortal in an ocean of concrete, or that he'd give him/her/it the cliche "cement shoes in the ocean" treatment?

And what would stop the immortal from dragging you down with it? You'll drown eventually. The immortal won't. 




 Maybe I'm kind of weird, too picky, or whatever, but I've always loved this in any type of competitive game, but mostly fighters.

Games with matches against one-on-one opponents, where you can take your time, play defense when you need/want to (by using an opponent's moves against them if you're good at countering/blocking, for example), and at times you try to out-think your opponent instead of doing everything physically and/or frantically. That's normally what a real fight between two professional fighters is like. 

Am I mistaken here and most fighting games actually are like that? Are there certain fighting-game franchises (or iterations of franchises) that have this feel more than others? How do they achieve that type of gameplay successfully while still retaining the fun factor? And lastly, does anyone disagree with my opinion on this? 









 I'd tell him that I'm going to end his undefeated streak and I'd make a big deal about it every week and try to convince everyone that it will happen. Then I'd give it my all on the day of the battle and probably end up losing when I make a critical mistake or when I get too tired/beaten-up to continue.

... oh wait, that's Undertaker at WrestleMania. Nevermind. 




 Find something you're good at that others around you aren't, and offer to do it for people, for a small fee. For example: fixing computers, home improvement, car repair (or even washing/waxing cars), lawn care, etc.

The only thing is you wouldn't be licensed at any of these positions, thus you'd likely have no insurance. You need to let potential customers know this fact immediately and make sure they understand. Also, charge them less than an insured company would, obviously, to make up for the fact that you have none. 




 Sorry if this is really obvious to a lot of people. I don't own a smartphone, and whenever I borrow someone else's, I'm amazed at how the phone knows how I'm holding it. 




 You might have jumped the gun with this response just a tiny bit... 




 How the fuck are you not fired yet? 









 Would you accept it? Would you try to prove yourself wrong? How would you do it? 




 All while someone tries to take the hook out and probably makes the wound worse at least half the time?

Does it not hurt them? 









 Close enough. 




 Did that first bee take a bath in a tub of Cheetohs? 




 http://i.lvme.me/6boekf5.jpg 




 Well-played. Not even gonna lie, this made me laugh. 




 Admittedly, I only got it because my friend has worked there for five years, and he vouched for me before I even did all of this 














 It is, if you can afford it. 




 Then give me Option B. I don't see how watching a gruesome death once every seven days would be as much of a detriment than having no arms or hands.

I bet some people watch slasher/horror movies more often than once a week. 




 A blowjob.

I'm very lonely. 




 Can I get prosthetics? 




 Another user proves my point. There's a difference between being chronically depressed and "not being in the mood to do it." That's an excuse a girlfriend uses when she doesn't feel like fucking.

What if I'm so miserable and pissed while I'm there that I try to just keep to myself and pretend I'm not there, but people keep trying to talk to me, and then I have a massive panic attack?

Different story, right? Thought so. 




 I hope this doesn't turn into one of those "On the Hunt for Bigfoot" shows. Nobody ever finds any hard evidence. We'd have *heard about it already.*

Granted, I didn't read the article because I"m tired. 




  Do you really want to know how it is to have special needs? I bet not.

I **DO** have special needs. You're proving my point. Special needs are the same, psychologically or physically. My ailments might not keep me from being able to walk, but physical illness doesn't turn your world into a nightmarish abyss where no one understands you and anything bad or uncomfortable that happens to you can trigger a massive panic attack. 




  People are shit to people in wheelchairs, **the absolute majority only helps if it's their job to help.**

Or if they're family.

Unless you think every parent in the world would ignore their child's needs if the child was temporarily confined to a wheelchair and unable to walk. 




 But I want someone I'm comfortable talking to. Hell, I'm not even comfortable talking to my father about this, and I'm as close to him as anyone. That's probably at least partially due to the fact that he just doesn't get it (plus he grew up teaching me the whole cliche "Men are supposed to man up and bitch-slap their emotions whenever they feel sad" thing).

He and I just think way too differently for him to relate, and it's incredibly frustrating. 




  For video editing etc yes I would look for professional series cards like the nVidia Quadro series

The laptop I'm using now has an NVIDIA Quadro FX 2700M, and it gets about as hot as the surface of the sun.

 If either are located on the bottom of the laptop your cooling is going to suffer severely whenever the laptop is sitting flat on a table etc.

Would that apply if it was on a laptop cooler? 




 Tried therapy. Wasn't surprised it didn't work. I hate talking to people about my problems, especially people I don't know. 




 I hate light. I actually used to be terrified of the dark, but now it comforts me.

I live, alone, in the basement of this two-story house because it's the only room that doesn't let in sunlight. 




  People aren't going to cater to you just because your depressed

"People aren't going to cater to you just because you're in a wheelchair." 




  And the drowning man will sink should he not use his arms to swim.

And I am swimming. I'm taking psychiatric medicines and talking to my physician weekly about my mental health.

But going to this wedding would make the metaphorical "current" stronger and harder to swim against, if not just temporarily. 




   if you don't go you'll feel shitty in your comfort zone and wallow in it for who knows how long

I wallow in depression already.

"A drowning man cares not about the rain." 




 You guys are here, and that's great. I appreciate it. But support from strangers on the internet can only go so far.

As far as meeting people, I don't want to meet people. I hate people. People are the reason I spend 18 hours a day locked in a room with no light and ignoring almost any call I receive on my cell phone.

I can almost guarantee that forcing myself to go would do more harm than good for me. The only reason I'm even considering it is because I owe my dad big time. He is truly the *only* reason I have a roof over my head and food on my plate. He refused to abandon me when I was in desperate straits, and he goes beyond that very often (for example, allowing me to live in the house he owns, rent-free).

So basically, I'll feel like shit if I don't go because he's done so much for me and I'd feel like an asshole for disappointing him.

Or, I can feel like shit if I do go, because it'll be boring, because I hate crowds, I hate people, and I hate being out of my comfort zone. 




  is true strength really a single beam bearing an unbearable load until it can bear no longer, or is true strength having the faith in your fellow man to be able to show your weakness, and be helped by them.

Who's gonna help? Nobody. The best my father does (and I appreciate it) is help me out when I need money for my meds. Other than that, he thinks this whole issue of psychological imbalance isn't even real.

Us 20-somethings (or at least myself and most people I've seen) have parents who come from a generation where a lot of people thought depression/anxiety/mental disorders were all either fake excuses for laziness, a product of literal insanity, or simply hypochondria. I really wish people would read up on things or ask around. My dad's not an idiot, he's just used to old-fashioned values and beliefs. But he's not much of a reader or one to watch educational/documentary programs.

I just want someone, ONE PERSON IN MY LIFE, to understand that having severe depression/anxiety/both is just as bad as being terribly ill physically.

Instead, they think it's not, because there are very few palpable physical symptoms, many of the habits that occur because of depression can be easily confused with laziness, and if you're extremely unhealthy psychologically, you don't need to go to a hospital to stay alive (with obvious exceptions). 




  So, apart from the whole smoke and mirrors raging at life thing, why do you actually not want to go?

I don't understand what you mean by "smoke and mirrors," but it's simple.

This (my home) is my comfort zone. My mind doesn't like it very much when I leave my comfort zone. I need to stay in it as often as possible to avoid spending the rest of my life in a straitjacket.

The only time I'm willing to drag my broken, psychologically crippled ass out of bed is to go buy something I want/need, or to go to work. I don't think it's asking too much that I wish to remain in solitude otherwise. 




 That might have been your brain just thinking crazy (no offense) thoughts because it knew you wouldn't act on it, since you couldn't, what with the building being only two stories.

If you lived on the 28th floor of an apartment building and looked out the window, I'd be willing to bet that you wouldn't have that sudden, out-of-nowhere urge to jump.

But as others have said, there's no reason to take the chance and end up discovering that this isn't the case, before it's too late. Professional help is always good, and it's much less taboo/stigmatized than some people realize. 




 I have traits of a selfish, arrogant, condescending asshole, and I pretty much hate the entire world, but I would take a bullet for one person and one person only-- my father.

If it wasn't for him, I'd be penniless and homeless right now, having lost my job two years ago. He lets me live in the two-story house that he owns, while he and my stepmother live together a few minutes away. He's always willing to help me with anything even somewhat important, and he constantly refers to the home I live in as (and treats it as if it's) "My house," despite the fact that I haven't given him a dime in rent money.

Funny thing is, I've never been close to a situation like that where I'd have to potentially die to keep someone else from doing so. I don't know how I know I would do so for my father... I just know that I would. Without a doubt. 




 If it makes you feel better, your brain compounding negative occurrences with negative thoughts is actually your brain trying to help you.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/12yk37/how_i_feel_right_now/c6za4xk

I'm not 100% sure he's correct, but it seems plausible and makes sense to me.

My advice would be to see a doctor or a psychologist. The latter if you think talking to someone about your problems would help (a lot of people in your situation are the complete opposite, and it's understandable), or the former if you think psychiatric medication would be better (it's worked for me... kinda).

Hope you feel better. 




 A few months ago, I told my dad I'd go to my stepsister's wedding (Sunday, August 11th-- tomorrow as of this writing). I'm not close to her at all, or my stepmother, but my dad just married my stepmother and he really wants me to go.

One problem-- I feel like utter and complete shit right now because of recent events, and I know I'm gonna feel like shit tomorrow. I guarantee he's not gonna want to hear any of that, though. But if I was in the house coughing up blood, vomiting and having a fever of 102 degrees, I bet you he wouldn't give me shit about not going. Those physical ailments I just described are pretty much analogous to how I feel psychologically right now.

* "Man up and go."

* "Stop making excuses."

* "You're being ridiculous."

Would you say that to someone who was extremely sick physically? Of course not. But if you feel like shit psychologically, for some reason, it doesn't count.

Also note that I'm 24 years old and I live alone, so he made it clear that since I'm an independent adult, the choice is up to me. It's not a "If you don't go, I'm gonna beat your ass" or "I'll kick you out of the house if you don't go."

My dad is a really tough guy, and he doesn't show great sadness and such very often. But if I don't go, I get the feeling he'd be as close to heartbroken as he's been recently, because he (like many people) doesn't understand what depression and anxiety are like separately, much less combined. 

**EDIT:** Another reason he'd be really upset is that he'd think I was doing it out of selfishness, disrespect, or both, not because I feel terrible. Do you guys think there's any way to convince him otherwise? 




 So, in the future, should I look for a similar make and model of graphics card, just one that doesn't suck ass? What's the best way to tell before purchasing a laptop if the GPU will be able to handle the load that I'd put on it? 




 There is absolutely no hard evidence or physical proof at all. None. There's just speculation, assumptions, blatant untruths, misconceptions, etc.

Meanwhile, despite the onus being on the theists, there is MUCH better evidence for the lack of the Christian god's existence.

Put it like this-- I've said this before and I still think I'm right:

**There's more evidence to support the existence of Bigfoot than there is to support the existence of God.** 




 Save. Your. Fucking. Money. You. Retard.

-slap- 




  the only laptops in my experience that achieve mediocre success when it comes to idle temps are gaming laptops that have been designed to tolerate and perform under heavy system loads for extended periods of time.

It's funny, because I remember asking a few people if I should just get a gaming laptop so that I'll know the GPU and everything will be on point and able to handle a heavy load. They all said no, since gaming laptops are designed explicitly for gaming, and won't do as well with video editing as I thought.

Is that correct? 




 Very good explanation. Another thing to consider is that the free safety, being quicker and faster, is usually the last line of defense in a defense with only one player back.

He's also usually the better safety, between the two, at guarding receivers, so they may assign him to a WR if need be, where a strong safety is more likely to blitz or maybe pick up the running back. 




 The best explanations I've seen (which isn't saying much) are "Such-and-such happened, we don't know how, so it must have been God."

Things like evolution, or the fact that the Earth is almost perfectly positioned to support life, or the fact that atheist claim that the universe was created from nothing, etc. 




 What type of specs should I look for in a new laptop? GPU, CPU, RAM, etc. I need to be able to use high-end video editing programs (Sony Vegas, Adobe After Effects, etc.) without the computer feeling like it's about to burst into flames.

I assume the best GPUs are going to be in the most expensive laptops. 




 Remove dust how? Simply by hand?

I don't trust myself to do that. I'm not very... handy. I'm afraid I'll screw something up. 




 [This is what my GPU usually looks like after I've been browsing the web (no videos, no games, nothing that should stress the graphics card).](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png) Not good. So I decided to do the following:

Shut my computer off for the night (not sleep, not hibernate, completely shut down), and thus, it cooled down for a good 7-8 hours. Then, I turned it on, cut off my wireless internet connection so no programs that use the internet would activate automatically, and didn't run any programs save for three: Task Manager, Speccy (to monitor GPU), and Core Temp (to monitor processor cores).

After 58 minutes of idling (most of which was spent with the display turned off, since it automatically does so after two minutes-- just the display, not the computer itself. Like a screensaver), my GPU was at 65C, and my processor cores were at 59 and 60C respectively. I had absolutely no applications running (if you had looked in my Task Manager "Applications" tab, it would have been empty).

The computer was also hot to the touch, despite the fact that, just to make it clear, I didn't touch the computer once after starting it up and running the Task Manager, Speccy, and Core Temp.

Now, I know there a few possible solutions, and I have some questions about those.

* Compressed air to clean out potentially clogged fans/heat sinks. I'm REALLY broke right now, but I'm trying to scrounge the money to grab one or two. Let's say I do, and I use it, and it still overheats? Then what?

* I also have a laptop cooler that I used to use that actually helped keep the computer a little bit cooler, which is better than nothing. But there's a short in the power cord now, and I don't have any soldering tools or expertise to fix it myself. I tried to search the internet for somewhere I can buy just the power cord, since buying a new cooler would be pretty pointless. Nothing wrong with mine except the power cord. Does anyone know where I might be able to find a power cord for [this cooling pad?](http://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Laptop-Cooling-Turbine-SGA-4000-KKNF1/dp/B004G603E2) Also, is there maybe a common household item(s) that I can use until I get a new cord/cooler?

Thanks, and if I left anything out or wasn't clear, please let me know. 




 Would the lack of sunlight cause health issues? If not, gimme that. I love gray, cloudy days. The sun can eat a dick, making everything all bright and shit. 




 Thanks for the quick response. I'll probably have a little more to add to help you guys help me.

For shits and giggles, [here's my motherboard](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/Motherboard.png). I assume this is almost a direct result of the piece of trash NVIDIA calls a GPU.

No bueno. 




 A person's name affects their entire life?

Oh, boy... 




 I've never in my life seen so much embarrassing nonacceptance in one place. 




 Don't act like Hunter isn't a badass first name.

Triple H agrees. 




 Hey, guys. I don't accept other people's viewpoints on things! That makes me cool, right???? 




 None, because parents can name their kids whatever the fuck they want. 




 [Here's the specs on my GPU.](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png) I wasn't doing anything except browsing the web (no videos, no games, not even an animated smiley in an IM program). As such, you can see that it kinda sucks.

If I have the CPU idle, my GPU temp shouldn't ever go over like 40 or 50C, right?

Also, what's defined as idling? Would that be when the load is under a certain number (and, presumably, "System Idle Process" is in the 90s)? Can you leave a computer on as long as you want and still have it be considered idle? I was going restart the computer for the night so it cools all the way down, and then leave it on for 30 minutes with no programs running, except Speccy to monitor the GPU.

Good idea, bad idea? Did I have any misinformation above?

Thanks. 




 This only counts if you got her phone number. Unless you knew her already. But have an upvote anyway for the clever line. 




 Is there a way to check if background processes/bloatware are even the problem? I don't wanna go through all the processes and then find out it was never an issue.

My CPU generally stays at a load of 5 or below when I'm just browsing the internet or something. It's just that I think the video card overheats for no good reason, which overheats the motherboard, which makes my laptop feel like the surface of the sun to the touch.

**EDIT:** For example, right now, like I said, I'm doing nothing but browsing the web. I've got 12 tabs open, but nothing at all that should cause a heavy load. I'm running no other programs except Core Temp, Speccy, Yahoo IM, AIM, and Task Manager.

Despite this, my GPU is at 69C (very high, according to [this](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png)), and doesn't appear to have any plans to drop below that at all any time soon.

I'm not watching any videos, I'm not using anything like Sony Vegas or Adobe After Effects, and I'm not streaming anything anywhere. I'm convinced my GPU just sucks balls. 




  I think it's unfair to call someone's marriage that ends in divorce a result of solely bad decisions. People do change. 

I can understand that. I just have an aversion to the logic in the OP since it implies that the nature of marriage causes divorce, not the people who get married.

Kinda like the whole "Guns don't kill people, people kill people" thing. 




 I really don't like it when people say someone has such-and-such a chance of doing something because that's the average. If a person is careful who he/she marries, when he/she marries him/her, and makes sure that everything is as stable as it can be, I'd say they have a much better than 50/50 chance.

The fact that half of American marriages end in divorce, or whatever the hell the number is, has no bearing on a specific marriage. It's not the idea of marriage that causes it-- it's people's bad decisions. 




 Hehe, #3 looks like the Monopoly guy 




 I'm not an expert by any means, but I own several external HDDs, and all I do is plug em in, select the files I want, select "Copy," choose the (C:) or (E:) drive, and let the computer do the rest.

I don't know how many files you want to copy or how large in file size they are, so there may be a more efficient way. 




 Gotcha, I understand.

Thanks for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. 




 There's really no way to do it without taking the laptop apart in some manner? 




 I'd probably end up killing myself, my computer, or both.

Let's say I do get my hands on some compressed air. What exactly should I do to ensure I clean the interior of my laptop as thoroughly as possible? 




  The fact is, you have a Dell, they've probably disabled whatever features, if any, might be used to safely downclock in software.

I thought underclocking would affect hardware, not software? 




 I know this will sound like I'm being stubborn, but I honestly do not have enough faith in myself to take apart and reassemble a laptop. I practically live on my computer, so if anything happened to it, I'd be pretty screwed. 




  What? Could you open up task manager and tell me which program or process is causing this?

It's always something that could not possibly be the cause, like Task Manager or Windows Explorer. The computer just overheats so much it can't even handle simple tasks for the time being.

**EDIT:** And what's the best way to disable background processes, and knowing which ones I should and shouldn't disable? And what's "bloatware"? 




 I'm telling you, I can't get ahold of a can of compressed air. Unless there's a common household item I can use as a substitute, this isn't happening unfortunately.  




 You mean like an external hard drive plugged into the USB?

All taken within the last 2 minutes.

Now, I've heard (and not necessarily saying I don't believe) that most high-end laptops can handle 100C without potential system damage. But the issue here is that the computer reaches temps as high as 80 or above (shown in screenshots), despite the fact that I only have the following programs open:

* AIM
* Yahoo IM
* Firefox (admittedly, 9 tabs, but just Google, a message board, Reddit, Wiki, and TV Tropes)
* uTorrent
* Task Manager

Now, I believe my graphics card (NVIDIA Quadro FX 2700M) is known for being a piece of shit, mostly in terms of playing video... but I haven't watched any videos since I turned the computer on an hour ago (confirmed in Task Manager). I haven't run any other programs other than Speccy, which I closed after taking the above screenshots.

Like I said, I haven't done anything but browse a message board or two, as well as Reddit.

It seems like underclocking/undervolting are my only options. There's no way I can take my laptop apart to clean the fans (I have no experience whatsoever in doing so), and I can't get my hands on a cooling pad or a can of compressed air (long story).

How much can I underclock/undervolt? Is there a limit? I'd really like my laptop to stay below 60C at almost all times. If this means a sacrifice of performance, I can live with that. I just hate the feel of a scalding hot laptop (I can feel it even as I type), and it causes the computer's CPU Usage to jump to 100% at random times when I'm not doing anything that would consume enough power to take the laptop to full load.

Any comments, questions (if I left out important information or anything), suggestions, all are welcome.

Thanks, guys.

 It does come from your enemies. You just don't know they're your enemies yet. 




 I have some pills I have to take three capsules of, three times a day. So what I do is I take 9 out of the big container, and put them into a smaller, empty container. That way, I have what I know is a day's worth in one container, so I know it should be empty before I go to sleep.

Not trying to steal OP's thunder, just something I thought I'd share.

 Isn't it illegal, via the terms of service of most sites like this, that you don't share your account with anyone? 














 My internet goes out randomly for 2-3 minutes at a time, and I've determined that it's not some kind of electronic interference from other appliances, it's not the internet connection itself, and it's not the signal strength.

As such, I was suggested to change what's apparently called my "DNS switchboard" from my ISP to Google Public DNS.

On [this page](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#setup), step four of the process reads:

*Select the Networking tab. Under This connection uses the following items, select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and then click Properties.*

I have both IPv4 and IPv6. How do I know which one to choose? 




 So that if you drop of a glass or a plate, it doesn't break into a million pieces. 














 I've always loved the *Saw* series, and I find myself enamored with John Kramer's machinations. I've often thought of what kind of "game" he'd force someone I know to play, or even myself. So hit me, Reddit. 

Oddly enough, this is one of the few times when I hope this WON'T reach the front page. That'd be a lot of work.

**EDIT:** Also, depending on how many I have to do, I might not be able to get to these tonight. I'll try my best, though.

**EDIT 2:** If you don't mind, let me know if you're male or female and your age. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, it's okay. Just don't even mention it in your comment. 









 Russian Roulette, "Chicken" on railroad tracks, you name it. Anything where a life could potentially be lost.

This info is just there so you can think about if paying 1/5 of [x amount of] dollars is worth doing something that could kill you, or make you five times richer.

If you wouldn't do it for 1/5, would you for 1/10? 1/20? 







































 Once I start taking them, you're really gonna make me call my doctor every time I get a refill, even though I brought in the confirmation note for the prescription the first time?

Ugh. Just venting. Sorry if this sounds bad or weird. 









 [General computer specifications](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png)

[Graphics card specifications](http://3image.com/images/2013/07/23/gcard.png)

As you can see, the graphics card overheats (which I think is a consistent problem with this specific video card), which causes the motherboard and processors to over heat, and that causes my laptop to stall and struggle to run the simplest of tasks because of the excess heat. Plus I don't think that a constant temperature of ~75C is healthy for a laptop.

I'm looking for anything, *anything* at all that even has a chance of maybe helping with this problem. Software, BIOS updates, changes to any settings on the computer (such as under Control Panel, etc.). Anything. Anything at all.

Thanks in advance. If you need any more info, it shouldn't be a problem at all for me to provide it. Feel free to tell me if I've omitted anything important. 









 [Computer specifications](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png)

I can't watch a high-quality video (even on YouTube) without the graphics card overheating, which then overheats my processors and motherboard. At that point, the CPU Usage skyrockets to 100%, and stays there while I can't do much of anything. I can move the mouse and click things and everything still technically functions normally, just *extremely* slowly. As if the computer is struggling to carry out the simplest tasks because the video card is so weak but is also trying its hardest to maintain quality video feedback (which it doesn't more often than not).

What are my options other than "Buy a new laptop"? 




 We know one wild bull will gore everything with a heartbeat, but what if *another* bull was introduced? How would they act towards each other and towards the matador?

 [My computer specs, courtesy of Speccy)[http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png]

And when I say it "goes out," I don't mean that my modem/router doesn't pick up a connection. It still does, and I'll stay connected to my wireless network on my laptop, but web sites won't load. However, if I have something running that runs perpetually and doesn't have to be reloaded (like Xbox Live, instant messenger programs, torrents, etc.), they will stay connected to the internet (i.e., torrents will still download, I can still send/receive IMs, can still play games online, etc.), even while I can't access web pages.

When this happens, nothing on my router/modem changes. All the lights are lit, and it shows that I'm connected to the internet.

I made this thread before but forgot about it, so I wasn't able to confer with other users. I was given the following advice:

***You could try adding Google's DNS to your settings, it's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Or some other DNS service.***

***Try this. It sounds like a service on your router is crashing (probably DNS) and the 2 or 3 minutes if how long it takes your router to notice and restart the service. Using an external DNS will solve this by removing your dependency on the crashy DNS server.***

So, three questions:

1. Is this the best way to remedy this? If not, what is?
2. How do I go about doing this?

Thanks 




 And what, if anything, did the FCC have to do with this decision?

**EDIT:** Just in case some people don't watch the show, I'm referring to the TV series *South Park.* 




 I made this thread a few days ago, starting off with "Zoologists/animal experts of Reddit," but now I realize that pretty much anyone could have a good answer for this thread. 









 Other than "Holy shit I can't believe the religious conservatives haven't gotten this cancelled yet." 














 I've attempted to convert four MKV files to MP4 format. The first three had the audio out of sync with the video, but one of them had no sync issues whatsoever.

Any ideas as to what the problem could be? Should I post the codec info for the videos that didn't work and the one that did? 














 **NOTE:** This is a re-post from last night. No one responded (I assume they wouldn't, since it was late), so I hope doing this isn't against the rules/rediquette. I did read through them both to make sure it isn't, but if I missed something and it actually is against the rules, I apologize.

[Here are my system specs](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png), courtesy of Speccy. As you can see, my graphics card kinda blows (I wasn't doing anything that should strain the video card-- not watching videos or playing games. Just surfing the web), even though I believe it was touted as one of the most powerful when it was released.

My laptop is a Dell Precision M6400 workstation (released in 2008). I will admit that at times, I do use strenuous programs-- mostly Sony Vegas for video editing. I have a CM Storm laptop cooler, but there's a short in the power cord and it won't work unless I hold it a certain way, and I can't do that and use the computer at the same time.

Unfortunately, I can't afford a new laptop cooler, much less a new computer. Are there any ways to keep my laptop cool consistently, or to cool it down when it gets past my preferred temps (without shutting it down or putting it in Sleep/Hibernate mode)?

I've actually heard of using ice to keep one's laptop cool-- does this really work? I can't remember the specifics, but I definitely remember reading that at least twice on this subreddit.

**Also, a disclaimer-- I'm 99% sure that I won't be willing to take the laptop apart at all. The warranty expired a long time ago, and I know jack shit about advanced computer hardware.**

If you need any other information, don't hesitate to let me know. 
























 And when did I ever say that Russell is the undisputed GOAT? 




 You're basically saying that since everyone, ostensibly, doesn't totally agree on subjective measurements, you can't argue one player as the GOAT.

That's the POINT OF A DEBATE. One person has his subjective argument, and another has his subjective argument, and you TRY TO PROVE THAT YOURS MAKES MORE SENSE.

It's what the concept of debating is BASED ON. 




  You can argue Russell is the most dominate player over his peers if you want, but **no one can look at a game from the 60s and one from the 90s and say they are the same.**

And no one has said they are. The point is that Bill Russell did things no one else has done. Yes, his competition was weaker, but he accomplished a whole lot more than anyone else ever has.

That's like if I play NBA 2K14 on Rookie and score 1,000 points in one game with one player. You can use the "It's Rookie mode, too easy, only reason you did that" argument if you want, but 1,000 points with one player is amazing, period. 




 Why does a player have to be overwhelmingly better than the next-best player to be the GOAT?

Once again, you believe in that logic, and that's fine, but that doesn't make it 100% fact. 




 Kinda like it's important to recognize how you think you know everything when you don't, much less something personal about a person you don't know at all? 




 http://sidoxia.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/pot-kettle-black.jpg?w=455 




 The fact that you believe in this logic doesn't make it infallible. 




 Wonderful.

Should I just give up on trying to have a reasonable discussion? 




 Not sure what the hostility is for. Chill out.

Anyway...

 There is no objective determination of how to value these things.

Then how do we know who's better than who in any era? Also, at least half those statistics suck and are unreliable/fallacious. 




  it's impossible to compare him to the modern era to the variety of rule changes and fundamental play style differences.

It really isn't, though. Not if you know enough about basketball.

You can look at stats, video, his performances against the best players/teams (single-handedly kept Wilt below his average in 100+ career matchups), etc.

For God's sake, the man was VOTED BY THE NBA as the greatest player of all time in the 80s. 




  Video and stats of the games don't exist or aren't recoverable

They do. There's plenty of video, and professional historians have researched and recorded advanced statistics for Russell's era. That's how we know how great his defensive impact was-- the Celtics' team Defensive Rating skyrocketed as soon as he came to the team, and fell off a cliff the minute he retired.

 there's no objective means of weighing statistics.

Why not? All you have to do is look at what the rest of the league was doing, and how that player performed relative to the average. As long as you have enough knowledge to properly account for any extenuating circumstances, it shouldn't be a problem. 




 Wow, the downvotes.

Note to self: Unpopular opinions are against the rules, no matter how logical. 




  You have to take into account positional differences, the players they played against, and even things like referee playcalling differences. It really isn't possible.

What exactly makes this impossible...? 




  I think it's hard to judge Russell because of his era, and the fact that his team was loaded with HOFers during an time with few NBA teams.

Those players were Hall-of-Famers due to Russell. Look at their statistics, research them, watch them play, and tell me with a straight face that Russell had an All-Star team around him.

 Jordan is just easier to compare, because the number of teams is the same and the talent level hasn't changed dramatically from then to now.

But they have. The rules are different (to Jordan's benefit), players are much better defensively, players are more athletic, and defensive schemes are more advanced. 




 My bad. I'm new here.

And I think Bill Russell being Top 5 should be a given. Top 3 should probably also be without question. 




 That's not necessarily true. We have all the advanced statistics and video to properly judge players relative to their era. It's very practical to rank one player as being greater than anyone else who has played in the NBA. 




 This isn't true at all. You really should research Bill Russell (not even trying to patronize).

His defensive ability was absolutely ridiculous. 




 11 championships, five League MVP awards, All-Defense 1st Team in its first year of existence (his final season), only player to win a championship in his first and last year, and not to mention his galactic impact defensively that literally affected the entire league (and will never come close to being replicated).

In my opinion, he clearly has a case as the greatest player of all time over Jordan or whoever you have up there. 




 He who asks shall receive! Even jokingly.

 Dolphins1925 screwed Dolphins1925 




 That single event in 2002 pretty much fucked up my entire life, to this day. I became cold toward others, I became so depressed that I lost the will to do much of anything. My grades slipped (I was always a very good student and very intelligent), I never finished high school, I couldn't even make it through community college, and I've never gotten a job by legitimate means (my dad got me one, and a friend got me another one).

I've also accrued significant debt, have very little money to my name, no job, and take five different psychiatric medications on a daily basis. 




 I was 13 years old, raised Christian, with no one in my family (including myself at that point) even considering the fact that the Christian God might not exist.

Christmas was always one of my favorite holidays, and it was my mother's, too. She and I were very close to one another, and we had a lot of fun every year setting up decorations and receiving/giving presents.

Then, in the Christmas season of 2002, I noticed that she was less jovial than usual and was spending a lot more time in bed than usual. Me and my dad decorated the house, which I usually did with my mom. I was told she was just a little under the weather and would be fine soon.

On December 22, she passed away from cancer. Three days before Christmas. Three days before our favorite holiday. I was 13 years old.

I was broken emotionally and probably still haven't recovered. It wasn't long after that when I decided that I refuse to worship a god who would take something like that away from me at the worst possible time.

Then, my big cousin, who I was closest to after my mother passed, was killed in a car accident last year. He was 26 years old. I am, and have been for a long time, perpetually depressed, feeling like I want to cry pretty much 24/7. But not when I was around my cousin. He was such a happy, funny, effervescent, and most importantly, nice guy that it was impossible for me to be depressed around him. Every time he came over and we played video games together, I never ever felt depressed. He and I would crack jokes and have as good a time as you'd ever see me have. And now I'm never going to see him again.

At that point, I firmly decided that if God exists, he can send me to Hell, because I will absolutely not bow before a deity whose existence hasn't even been close to being proven, and who (if he DOES exist) is taking away the few people in my life that I have a strong relationship with.

If he wants to condemn me to the underworld because I don't believe he exists, due to a significant lack of hard evidence, then so be it. 




 Back when my house had a serious mouse problem, I once saw two mice chasing each other. One would chase the other, then they'd turn around and the other one would chase, and so on.

* [A] Google
* [A] Yahoo
* [A] Reddit

Can I do that with a single command/function, or would I have to go through each file and add the label myself?

Thanks.

 But the thing is that Cena didn't gradually build up to the FU/AA (in kayfabe), and while you make a good point about Shawn Michaels, his superkick has put down some of the most credible wrestlers in recent history. The Twist of Fate doesn't have that to say for itself. 




 Shawn Michaels is amazing at telling a story during a match (his "Concussion" match vs Orton was barely even a wrestling match, yet it was still extremely entertaining, at least IMO), and it's really this simple-- he knows what he's doing in the ring more than anyone in WWE history (arguably). I've never seen him botch noticeably, and he knows his opponent's tendencies, as well as just how to work a match or even one spot, that it's almost impossible for him to put on a bad match.

He's one of those guys who either never makes mistakes, or when he does, you can't even tell, because he covers it up.

Remember when DX vs Rated RKO (I think) broke down because of Triple H's torn quad? Orton was running around like a lunatic, confused as hell (not a slight-- he was very young), but Shawn handled the situation as perfectly as he could have. On top of all that, he's also arguably the best face character of all time.

**tl;dr** Shawn Michaels is the Michael Jordan of pro wrestling. 




  I defy anyone to tell me that Angle pulling the straps back up, just so he can pull them down again isn't one of the greatest spots ever.

It was an amazing portmanteau of goofy Angle and wrestling-machine Angle. It seems kind of goofy to do, but he was so determined to win and prove he's a superior wrestler that he needed to get into the zone while already being in the zone. 




 Goddamnit, I came in here to read stories of failure. Fuck all you people with your "I never thought this amazing thing would happen and it did! :D" posts.

I hate my life. 




 I think it's a bit early for that. He's won, what, four matches with it? 




 I'd be hesitant to use moves that started off as just signature moves that didn't end a match, and then eventually became finishers.

But if you can convince me otherwise, I'm definitely listening. 




 That was in 1996, though.

Eventually, I might extend this into the 1990s. Could be fun.

 Best-looking stolen finisher I've ever seen. 




 When, exactly? The problem with Sweet Chin Music is that Michaels almost never hits it after tuning up the band, and when he hits the "out of nowhere" version, he usually collapses from fatigue, which keeps him from getting an immediate pin. 




 [Did I miss something?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=Btn1RwdSsAU#t=917) 




 [This looks like the sequence you're talking about.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZJBmM-jFKA feature=player_detailpage#t=1386) It was a roundhouse kick, not a GTS. 




 I don't think it's spelled that way... 




 I only watched that match once, and wasn't really paying attention since I figured it'd be underwhelming compared to the last four WrestleMania matches Undertaker has. I wouldn't be surprised if Punk did, though. 




 I love when Punk does that. Just like he did at Night of Champions against Cena. His own finishers weren't working, so he was like "Fuck it" and pulled out the most random Rock Bottom ever. 




 That's actually a very good point. I definitely think that could qualify as a "no-sell." 




 By the way, I think we can all agree (as if it had to be confirmed) that this cements the fact that Undertaker at WrestleMania is the most credible wrestler of the modern era (in major United States wrestling, at least)?

I can only imagine Hogan and Goldberg as possibly being his equal. 




 I also wanna say maybe the World's Strongest Slam? But Henry's been around for so long that I'd assume someone has kicked out of it cleanly at some point. 




 I guess you don't go 434 consecutive days as a world champion with a finisher that doesn't put people down on the first try.

Also, I'm probably missing many instances of numerous finisher kick-outs, so bear that in mind. I listed all that I could think of after research and going off of my own memory. 




 The Jackhammer should fit that description, but Hogan was forced to kick out during a match in which Kevin Nash was supposed to break up the pin, but was too slow to get into the ring.

If I recall, that is the only time anyone has ever kicked out of the Jackhammer.

Honorable mention to Beth Phoenix's Glam Slam. Only Natalya has kicked out of that move. 




 This has always been one of my favorite parts of wrestling. Seeing wrestlers kick out of credible finishers, with no/minimal delay between the finish of the move and the pin (due to an incapacitated referee or a wrestler "crashing" due to fatigue after using his finisher).

To be honest, this isn't what it might look like-- a list of the best matches in which one can find at least a single false finish. I intend this to be more about discovering/discussing which finishers are most credible, and/or which wrestlers have the (kayfabe) durability to survive the most effective finishers of the last decade-plus.

This list is going mostly off of memory, with me going back to find video to confirm and make sure I'm right. Others are free to contribute by correcting mistakes on my part, listing occurrences I missed, telling me any finishers you think should be added, or anything else that you feel might add to the thread.

I also included some instances of "No-selling," where a wrestler takes a finisher, and immediately recovers, usually to apply a ground-based submission (Undertaker's Hell's Gate, Lesnar's Kimura Lock, etc). I understand that this is very much a judgment call, so I'll listen to any and all opinions regarding this aspect of this list.

I'll post links to as many videos of each occurrence as I can, but for now, I'll leave it as is until I see how well-received this thread is. I apologize to anyone who might want video of the below instances.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the positive feedback everyone, and the suggestions for entries/moves to be added. I'll definitely try to add everything that was pointed out some time today.

Keep em comin!

**EDIT 2:** Just a request to make things a little easier on my part-- not trying to be too demanding, but it'd help me out a lot if when you guys let me know "[X wrestler] kicked out of [Y finisher] at [Z event]," to provide video if possible. That'll make it easier for me to add it to the listing, and it will confirm it more quickly than me having to look everything up myself.

Suggestions are, of course, still welcomed. In fact, they're allowed.

**EDIT 3:** Undertaker's no-sell of the GTS and Punk kicking out of the Tombstone at WrestleMania have been added, as well as a few others, and some links added.

 Little known fact: You get better acoustic quality with dixie cups. They were actually ergonomically designed for this purpose-- then people just started drinking stuff out of them for whatever reason.

Weirdos.

Or two dixie cups tied together by a string. 




 I really don't wanna be that guy, but seriously? This is basic high-school stuff. 




 Kid used to bully me in like 3rd grade for no reason. Never forgot his name or what he looks like.

15 years later, I go to get lunch and find out he's a minimum wage slave at McDonald's.

I'm not saying I Success Kid'd in my head, but... 




 What about the option of using the "Master password" option some browsers have? I've never tried it, but I've seen it while going through my settings. 




 Exactly. Joyner hosted both shows from 1985 to 1993. Almost 30 years ago. 




 I'd assume that if it was possible to host both shows from the same place, he'd have done it. 









 Believe it or not, I couldn't find a clip of that Spear that I felt comfortable using. I don't like using the regular, standard, zoomed-out camera angle. It's a shame that I wasn't able to include it, too-- it's one of his best Spears in WWE.

I tried to make up for it by showing him flattening Christian three times _

  "Hey I noticed you sat next to me while being cute."

That right there is an A+ pick-up line. 




 I don't think anyone's beaten Undertaker three times in a row at all (one-on-one), much less on three consecutive pay-per-view events.

Good insight. 









 Is there a designated "GIF-making" user on here? If it doesn't get made tonight, I can do it early tomorrow morning most likely. 




 Because people think they're smart/hilarious when they chant the name of someone's previous gimmick or a wrestler they resemble. It's like a lot of people paid for their tickets to just act like a jackass on TV and maybe watch some wrestling, too. Which is fine; it's their right. But that doesn't mean I have to like it. 




 But that doesn't mean that other people won't feel like the show is a little tainted. They're not wrong for cheering and booing whoever they want, but it does sort of degrade the show to some people when the wrestlers are trying to stay in kayfabe and the crowd is breaking it all night long. 




 The fact that he's heel makes him a lot less "Goldbergy" than before. Throughout his entire US wrestling career, Goldberg was a heel for about 4 minutes. 




 Six years and 364 days later, he lost a one-on-one match to CM Punk on SmackDown (06/22/10).

After the seven-year anniversary of Kane's unmasking passed the next day, he went three months without being defeated, with most of that time coinciding with his reign as World Heavyweight Champion.

Kane broke a mirror, unmasked against his will, and had a horrible streak of losses and bad breaks for the next *seven years*...

Then, as SOON as seven years passed, he went on a very solid winning streak (11 straight wins from the end of June to the beginning of October), and during that winning streak won his first world championship in over a decade.

Coincidence, or an amazingly thorough angle that was never even brought up?

**EDIT:** For those wondering when Kane broke the mirror-- it was a backstage segment right before the match that probably isn't well-known at this point (I probably wouldn't have known, either, if I hadn't found this video on my hard drive one day when I was bored).

[Here's a GIF for those who don't remember](http://3.imgland.net/620vRz.gif) 




 All I remember is that Ranjin Singh had a jacket that read "THE GREAT KHALI SAYS..." on the back.

I wanted one of those. 




 "I saw you on the other side of the room, and I'm gonna be honest with you... I said to myself 'This girl is so fine... she is SO out of my league, that I have to say something.' So I'll just ask... could I take you out some time? Maybe for coffee? Nothing too serious. I'd just love to get to know you."

They laugh at the "SO out of my league" part every time. 




 Gotcha.

Also, to summarize what you said about 3-4 vs 4-3, it seems like 3-4 is better against outside runs (since you get the extra speed with the additional linebacker), whereas 4-3 is good against inside runs, with the two tackles attempting to clog the middle. Is that right?

And for what it's worth, I just noticed that the Patriots' 4-3 pretty much looks like a 3-4. Instead of four linemen in three-point stance and three linebackers behind them, they have three linemen in the 3PS, with Ninkovich and Mayo at the line of scrimmage, flanking the linemen on either side. How should I treat this formation? Could this work similarly to a 3-4? 




 Also, maybe you could help me tackle this dilemma?

**EDIT:** Heh. "Tackle." Football humor.

/Squidward 




 Haha, fair enough. That sounds pretty good for me, since I'm an offense-first guy (might have been obvious, given the team I use).

One more quick Q-- let's say I see a one-deep safety look, but the defense is actually running two deep safeties. One of the safeties might come down into the box (even though he's still going to play deep), but I should be able to exploit the fact that he's too close to the LoS with deep routes to his side, right? 




 I always try to apply this mindset: "Don't assume that, since you can't smell you, other people can't smell you." 




 Quick question regarding position play-- Jerod Mayo is listed as a ROLB in Madden, and Spikes as the MLB. Generally, if I'm gonna run a defense with only one linebacker (like Dime), I'd want my best linebacker on the field, right?

On Pro Football-Reference, both Mayo and Spikes are listed as simply "LB." Would switching their positions and having Mayo at MLB potentially hurt my defense more than it helps? 




 Is there any way the defense could disguise that type of look to make it appear as if the safety is compromising the weak side of the field, but they actually have the entire field covered (as best as a defense can)?

I guess technically there definitely is a way to disguise it, but how easy is it? Should I expect to see people do this, or are most not knowledgeable enough to do so? 




  Basically, if the defense is showing one high safety against a pass-heavy formation like trips right, the hole in their defense is likely to be on the left. 

But, just to be sure, one high safety could also mean that they have three deep defenders, right? I suppose that's something I have to identify at the snap-- look to see if the other safety and a corner drop back into deep zones as soon as the play starts. 




 Wouldn't a play with two or three deep zones be better for defending deep throws than just one safety playing deep? 




 I've actually always thought about that. Generally, a guy can see a cute girl that he doesn't know and try to charm her with small talk, and then ask for the digits. For the most part, worst-case scenario is that she'll respectfully decline, as long as the guy doesn't come off as an ass or doesn't take no for an answer. Most of the time, at the very least, the girl is flattered.

Gay guys don't have that luxury. Straight men aren't flattered by having gay guys make a move on them. Plus, there's no way to tell for sure if another guy is gay, and if you hit on the wrong straight guy (read: probably around 90% of straight guys, because people are stupid and judgmental), you could definitely get into a fight.

That must suck.

Thanks. 




   I like to use my backs out of the backfield if I see **a single high safety towards trips**

Could you elaborate on this a little? What exactly does that mean (mostly wondering about the "towards trips" part-- I know trips refers to 3 WRs on the same side, and single high safety means one safety deep pre-snap)?

Thanks. 




 I think I'll just cut out the middle man and use the camera to see at all times 









 I really hope you don't start talking to mannequins in abandoned video stores. 




 Will definitely check that out, thanks. 




 I watch a lot of football, and sometimes it's hard to tell why players make certain decisions. I also watch NFL Playbook on the NFL Network sometimes, even though it can be a little confusing every now and then.

I'll definitely take a look at that link too. Thanks. 




 First off, thanks a lot for the speedy reply. I'm pleasantly surprised at this. Anyway:

 As for alignment, the numbers just refer to linemen then linebackers. A 4-3 is 4 linemen and 3 linebackers.

Yeah, I know that much (I think). Nickel would be essentially 4-3, except the third linebacker is replaced by a cornerback, and Dime replaces the second AND third linebacker with cornerbacks, leaving one linebacker on the field.

That's why I figured counting linebackers could help (IIRC, linebackers always have jersey numbers in the 50s). Two guys wearing 50-something? Nickel. One guy? Dime.

What you said about the nose tackle and identifying 4-3 vs 3-4 is exactly what I was talking about when I said I used to be able to do that. Relaying that information to me is a great place to start, and I appreciate it.

Also, since we're talking about it, when I'm on defense, how do I decide between 4-3 or 3-4, or even Nickel? They're all somewhat versatile formations, aren't they?

I use New England by the way, if that helps. Their linebackers have pretty good size, Jerod Mayo is an absolute beast, and I think Hightower and Spikes have good speed and tackling ability. Plus I have Wilfork on the nose, and Rob Ninkovich is a pretty fundamentally sound LB/DE (if I'm wrong about any of this, feel free to correct me).

So, given my personnel, how should I decide between 4-3, 3-4, Nickel, etc.? Dime is mainly for defending the pass-- I know that much. But between the other three formations I mentioned, which is good for runs, or short passes, or maybe situations where the defense has a ton of options (like 2nd and 5 or 6 maybe)?

If I have any other questions, I'll let you know... if I haven't burnt you out by now. Thanks again. 




 Beth Phoenix main-evented one Raw towards the end of January in 2011, I think. Can't remember exactly when. It wasn't announced throughout the show as the main event, but it was the last match. Close enough. 




 The first thing I guess I should do is let you know how much I know about the sport. I'm no newb to advanced football strategy, but I'm definitely not an expert either. 

I know things like how to read the safeties pre-snap (one deep means Cover 1 man/zone or Cover 3 zone, two deep means Cover 2 man/zone or Cover 4-- not always, obviously, just mostly). However, **I can't look at a defense and tell you for sure if it's a 4-3, 3-4, Nickel, Dime, etc.** This is especially difficult in Madden, since you can't see the players' numbers pre-snap, so it's impossible to simply count the linebackers and go from there. I'd have to be able to look at the alignment of all the defenders and memorize what each formation looks like in this regard (which I used to be good at, but not anymore).

I'm also okay at identifying zone/man right after the ball is snapped. If the defenders turn their hips to chase the receivers, man. If they stay squared to the line of scrimmage even as receivers run past them, zone. Easy. But at the same time, **I find it difficult to identify (or even make an educated guess of) zone vs man before the snap.** I'm not even sure if this is possible for someone who doesn't play the quarterback position at an organized level, but if it is, I'd love to learn how.

I'd also like to learn things like reading blitzes pre-snap, knowing when to adjust your blocking schemes (i.e., block left/right/pinch/aggressive) before the snap depending on what the defense does, how to adjust to certain strategies during the course of a game, etc.

Would you guys be willing to help me with this? I know a lot of people would probably recommend some of the websites that specialize in teaching this knowledge, but I learn better by actually talking to people and absorbing information through conversation, as opposed to simply reading a generic write-up (not saying they can't be helpful, but I learn better this way).

Thanks, guys. 




 6-7 minutes with accelerated clock won't get you realistic stats in my opinion. 10-12 should work.

I wish I could play on 15. I like my games to be as realistic as possible, and I hate playing less than the real-life amount of time per quarter. But still, I'm gonna try to manage playing on 10-12.

If I can suck it up and do it, anyone can. 




 I know this is something that can't be completely identified via statistics, but which stats exist, if any, that come closest to doing so?

Is there a site that shows quarterbacks' completion percentages by distance that the ball travels? I know they have a stat called "Air Yards," which is a measure of how far a QB throws the ball when completing a pass (basically passing yards minus yards after catch), but I don't know if that would work very well.

Any suggestions? 




 Misread the last word on the bottom caption. Got confused and wondered how having a tiger as a best friend would help me get a job. 




 I have an Intel Mobile Core 2 Duo processor, and the reason I ask this is because I use WMP to stream music to my Xbox 360. So, ostensibly, the program has to be running the entire time I stream. But the problem is that, even when I'm not actively doing anything in the program, it seems to take up a great deal of my CPU usage.

Is this normal? Is there a way I can mitigate this? Is there another program I can use to stream music and playlists to my 360?

Thanks.

 Using Windows 7 Ultimate, 64-bit with Comcast internet connected via wireless router.

Every time I run the program, my internet randomly drops for a few minutes at a time, although there are no actual indications. Nothing on the modem changes, my connection status stays the same, and the torrents even keep going. But anything that has to be reloaded (web pages, etc.) will not work (I'll get the same error message I'd get if I turned my internet off).

I couldn't figure out why until someone on this subreddit suggested it might be my torrent program, so I did some testing, and discovered that when the program isn't running, my internet has no problems at all. And when the program *is* running, I get the issues that I described earlier.

Is there anything you guys would recommend here so that I can run my torrent program without compromising my internet connection?

Thanks.

  My soul (waste of 21 grams if you ask me)

They'd have a heck of a time procuring it, I think. 




 This question came to me earlier today, when I realized that I could probably make at least a few bucks if I sold a miniature collection of rare currencies from around the world.

The reason I would never sell it is because my late mother (whom I was EXTREMELY close to) gave them to me on a business trip when I was 12 (she passed when I was 13). Her job required that she travel globally, and she spent nearly all my life collecting coins and what have you from different countries, because she knew I loved rare currencies.

Every time she left for a business trip, I would cry myself to sleep almost every night because I missed her so much, so she made sure that at least once a week, I got a letter from her telling her how much she misses and loves me. One day, a small zipper pouch came with one of the letters, and it had [this picture](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UcAUEMTbGcw/UZ0bChxy_xI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/D1YH81lzbN8/s1600/Guess+How+Much+I+Love+You.jpg) on it. It was the last gift I ever got from her, and I cried when I saw it in the envelope with the letter.

I keep it right next to my bed on my table, I never move it, and I never put anything on top of it. Every time I pass the end table, I look at it and smile while holding back tears.

I would never even think about selling it. For any price. Ever. 









 Garden tools prior to brethren. 




 The idea is that if you go back in time and change things from the way they were normally, things in the future could be drastically different in a seemingly unrelated way. For example, in Ray Bradbury's "The Sound of Thunder" (I think), one of the characters steps on a butterfly's wing while in the past, and finds that in the "new" present, words are spelled differently, and things like that (presumably because of an incomprehensibly long chain of events).

Wouldn't that apply to going to the past, on its own? Just your presence in the past can alter things. You could leave footprints where there weren't any before, or cover up the tracks of something that *was* there. You could startle a person or catch their attention as you walk by, which keeps them from focusing on what they were doing, which could change their day, which could change the area, which could change the world. Etc.

But characters always seem to say "Don't touch anything, don't move anything, and be as discreet as possible." Not "Man, even just being in the past is probably gonna make the present noticeably different." If I'm wrong about this, feel free to correct me. It's been a while since I've seen/read a work of fiction involving time travel and the butterfly effect.

 User /u/cobalthawk gave me a link to [this website](http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/content/walladapter.html) (and I appreciate it!), but I figure I might screw up and get the wrong one.

As such, I thought maybe the best way to go about this would be to look at the little information sticker on the adapter with letters that are barely big enough to read, and use that information to find an adapter online that I know for sure will work.

Is that possible/plausible? If so, would you guys mind helping me with it?

Thanks. 




 Nah, no way. Guys don't think about stuff like that generally. You could be shy, you could be sheltered, you could just have had more important things in your life than intimate relationships, etc.

I doubt many people would assume something's wrong with you. 




 If a guy meets you and is into you and it gets serious, he'll feel like he found a diamond in the rough.

If this goes on for another 24 hours, I'm going to wake up in a straitjacket.

 [Being immortal would suck balls.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/WhoWantsToLiveForever) I hate kids, but I'll take that choice in a second.

 




 http://www.livememe.com/du9uesh 




 Why do next week what you can say you'll do next week and then never do it? 




 I run into this problem a lot on my TV Tropes watchlist. 




 Well, we don't really have to worry about that. I've given up on women for good. I can live with being literally forever alone. 




 Nope. Never even got close to getting in trouble. tbqh, I suspect some women really like it. It's like, they're so attractive, that even when they're asleep, I can't resist my urge to have them.

It's actually a lot easier than you might think to ask a woman "Can I do stuff to you while you sleep?" At least once you get to know her and you're comfortable around each other. Usually, once we at least sleep together, she's sorta used to my nighttime tendencies, since I absolutely love to spoon, so of course I cop a feel every now and then during. 




 I used to. Two, actually (not at the same time). One can't hold her liquor at all (she was my first, regarding this fetish-- it was actually her idea o_O), and another is borderline narcoleptic. She falls asleep in an instant and is an extremely heavy sleeper.

I feel like the universe did me a solid by giving me two women who are so conducive to my fetish. I believe in highly unlikely coincidences, but damn that's lucky. 




 Really? Did this post really offend someone?

Come on, talk to me. My curiosity has been piqued. 




 Therapy? For what reason? It hasn't gotten me in any trouble. There are ways to act on this attraction in a legal manner. It's not intrinsically a situation that will always be considered rape (something the first commenter clearly does not realize). 




 I am black, and I was just kidding. I thought shifty-eyes was the universal Internet emoticon to indicate facetiousness. 




 Most likely shyness. I've always been worried that the things I like (sexually) would turn a woman off out of weirdness or simply because it's mostly for my satisfaction and not hers.

For example, I love to simply touch up and down a woman's body with my hands, and do nothing more. I could do this all night, without any intercourse or anything else, and be completely satisfied. Of course, if a woman was awake and you literally did that for 5 straight hours, she'd get bored or annoyed. 




 Whether it's touching them, simply looking, kissing, spooning, undressing, etc.

To be clear, this has nothing to do with rape. Lack of consent is not where the attraction comes from. The attraction, at least for me, mostly comes from being in control without really having to assert oneself (I've always been shy sexually).

AMA. And I meant absolutely anything.

**NOTE:** I did post this a few days ago, but didn't get many responses. Hope a re-post so soon is okay.

**EDIT:** Forgot to add, I'm a 24-year-old male. 




 Not a loaded question at all, I'm just trying to figure out why we even bother resorting to war at all. I would assume fewer people dying in cold blood over political issues would be better. 




 I understand the basic concept of diplomacy, but I'm not an expert. Why hasn't it decreased the need for violent wars? Or has it? 




 Damn, guys. It was a joke. 




 But Steve Nash was born there, that's the difference. If you don't know who he is, he's [clearly not a black man.](https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1191506948/steve-nash.jpg) 









 So what would the inverse of this be?

"Yes, I realize that I am a dude"? 




 Because the OP clearly had to go after 15 minutes and run errands, such as snitching to the police, and reading books. smh. 




 Sellout. _ 




  I see it as a colloquial term of endearment between friends

That's exactly what it is. But for some reason, black culture condemns the use of the word by white people, even if it's clear as goddamn day that it's just a synonym for "friend" or "homie." 




 This is true (well, kinda-- hispanics are allowed, too).

It's stupid for black people to do it, but it is indeed true. And this is coming from a black man. 




 Does he have South African citizenship? I assume he'd be considered Canadian. 




 Thanks, guys! 




 Just replace "Santa" with "God" (or the deity/ies of any religion), and "getting presents" with "going to Heaven/not going to Hell" (or the equivalent for another religion).

I'm not even sure if this word exists, but I swear I've heard a word or phrase for it before. 









 Wouldn't the digestion process, especially the stomach acid, kill the prey as well? 




 I think he's saying the fact that people on the Internet aren't typing at random makes this quote fallacious, since (it seems) that the "monkeys" are being replaced metaphorically by people who use the Internet.

Of course a bunch of people typing coherent thoughts on a keyboard won't produce the complete works of Shakespeare, unless they choose to. This is totally different from the Infinite Monkey Theorem.

I think that's what rasmustrew is saying. 




 This is actually a really good question. There are two ways around this:

* I can ask for her consent when she's awake, and if she trusts me enough, I usually get the green light. If she says she'd be uncomfortable with it, I accept it and let her know I won't do anything (I tend to stay awake later than my partner at night, and I love to spoon).

* Or, she can fake it. Sometimes they'll wake up, and if I know it's a regular thing between us and she's fine with the fact that I'm doing it, I'll say something coy like "Just go back to slip." You know, half-joking. At that point, she just sighs or rolls her eyes facetiously, and does so. I've been told that when this happens, she actually didn't go back to sleep, and just faked it.

* I've also been told that they've woken up, but without me realizing it, and they continue to pretend they're asleep.

It is, as you inferred, a very tricky paraphilia to manage, but I haven't had any complaints yet. 




 Anything at all.

Also note: This is NOT a rape fetish. It's not based on a lack of consent. It's based mostly on being in charge without having to assert yourself, and having the freedom to do what you want without your partner finding it weird or dissatisfying (at least for me). 




 What your brain will tell you: Wallow in it and do nothing.

What you should do: Something you enjoy that can significantly distract you from anything other than the fact that you like doing it. 




 He said there wasn't a huge problem with PEDs, but guys who played in South America like he did would try to buy cocaine from there since it's cheaper, and then smuggle it into America during the off-season when they came back to the States.

Most got caught.

 I've been taking anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medications, and they're actually helping. Good news, obviously.

But it turns out to be somewhat of a lose-lose scenario. When I'm miserable and depressed, obviously that's not a good thing.

When I'm actually somewhat happy (and don't feel like breaking down into a heap and sobbing because I feel like complete shit for damn near no reason), it doesn't last.

Because almost as soon as I start to feel "happy" (I use that word tentatively-- "not cripplingly depressed" would probably be more accurate), I start thinking about my life. I start thinking about how my life isn't really that bad. I start thinking about how I'm having a good day and everything isn't darkness and misery.

Then I start thinking about how all that is going to go away, because eventually, I will die. I'm sure this won't surprise anyone, but I don't want to die. I don't want to not exist. I can barely fathom the concept.

I try to think of life like a plate of your favorite food. You eat it, you enjoy it, and you eventually finish it. But are you sad when it's all gone? No, because you're full. You've had as much as you want. Hopefully, life is like a plate of food, and by the time we finish it, it won't be an emotional burden, because we've done nearly everything we wanted to and won't necessarily find it to be heart-wrenchingly tragic that we will die.

But I'm starting to think this line of reasoning is less and less plausible everyday.

Writing this actually made me feel a little better. But not by much. I'm still in a psychological malaise over the fact that all this is going to be taken away from me eventually. 




 Sorry for being so late with the answer, but if you still care, he said that the craziest thing he'd ever seen as a pro basketball player happened during a tournament in South America. The winner of the game would advance to the Finals of the tourney, and my dad was on the away team.

My dad was "kicking ass" as he claimed (and trust me-- believe him), and when there was like 2 minutes or so left and his team was up 18, the entire crowd started throwing C and D batteries at the players and officials. And they actually let them finish barraging the players with Alkalines and finished the game.

If you meant the craziest non-basketball thing he's seen, I can ask him that.

 I think they were both WWE Champion (Punk leaving with the "real" title, and Cena holding the "fake" title he won against Rey Mysterio), and they were on adjacent turnbuckles.

CM Punk raised his title, and his music played.

Cena did the same, and his music immediately interrupted Punk's.

They did this back and forth at least three times each, I think. It was a cool moment, but I can't find video of it.

 I don't know if any of you guys get as immersed in kayfabe as I do, but I sometimes see things during a given show that make me ask "Why would this person do this, if we think in terms of kayfabe?"

For example, the fact that Triple H always covered the head of the sledgehammer with his hand when he used it as a weapon. Outside of kayfabe, it's obviously because (from what I hear) he uses a real sledgehammer 99% of the time, and he uses his hand to cushion the blow.

But it's still obvious that he does so to the viewer, so it might take away from the realism... unless you can think of a reason he would do it IN kayfabe. Like, maybe he covers the hammer itself so he can control it better, since a sledgehammer is actually pretty heavy.

Something like that. Using kayfabe to explain things that make sense in real life (where wrestling is choreographed), but don't appear to make sense in kayfabe (where wrestling is a legitimate sport).

The wiki could be set up as a Q A, where Wredditors can edit the wiki itself to either ask or answer a question like the above.

 I just used brackets to show which phrase I was inquiring about-- ah, excuse me. About which phrase I was inquiring. ... damnit, that was a dependent clause. Am I even allowed to start a sentence with "..."? SO MANY QUESTIONS.

:P

Anyways, which of the two bracketed phrases is correct? I'm leaning towards the first, since I think "second most" would be using "second" as an adverb to describe the adjective "most," whereas "second-most" is an adjectival phrase that would describe the noun "subscribers."

Or, on that note, I'm thinking maybe both could be considered correct? 




 Not an entire promo dedicated to it, but if he's cutting a promo, and the crowd starts chanting Goldberg's name, he could quip something along the lines of "[sarcastic laugh] Goldberg *wishes* he was as talented as I am." And then continue the promo.

 I always get caught off-guard when a woman gives me an extremely firm handshake. I never know whether or not to do so before the fact, since I'm worried about hurting her hand.

 I don't know dick about the law, but I assume there'd be something to protect the employee in a situation like this:

* Employee: "You... you're firing me?"

* Employer: "I'm sorry, but I have no choice. I need someone who won't miss shifts or leave before completing a shift."

* Employee: "I ALMOST DIED, YOU SON OF A BITCH!"

* Employer: http://fuuu.us/18.png

 Jesus Christ, dude. That is some grade-A work ethic. 




 Like others, I take a nap during the day after 4-6 hours of sleep at night. The only reason I really do this is because I like to stay up late AND wake up early. This is really the only way I could think to pull it off. I typically get to sleep around 1-3 AM and wake up at 6-8, then nap at around 12-1.

It doesn't feel any different than your typical 8-hour sleep cycle. I feel well rested each time I wake up, and I get to sleep pretty easily in both instances.

I've considered polyphasic sleep (because tbh, I really don't like sleeping), but I have insomnia from anxiety/depression, so I'd have to dope myself up on sleep aids multiple times a day. No, thanks.

 I understand the concept of Buddhist principles, Nirvana all that good stuff, but I still definitely wouldn't say it's something to live by. 




 I'm sorry... but BULL. SHIT. Suffering is not a conscious decision that we can choose not to go through. Suffering is an emotional response to pain, and if it was simple enough as "I don't want to suffer-- therefore I will not," nobody would smoke pot or take anti-depressants.

Emotional pain is almost exactly the same as physical pain. When it hits you, you hurt. When you hurt, you react. That reaction is what suffering is.

  I went to therapy once they told me that this could be my baseline. That I will always be this way.

I say that therapist is a quack. There is no such thing as an untreatable level of depression. We can treat CANCER, for God's sake. I refuse to believe that anyone with depression, no matter how severe, cannot be helped significantly. 




 Apparently, CBT is supposed to help one cope with anxiety/depression/mood disorders/etc., and learn how to live a relatively normal life despite the condition(s).

From what I've read and/or heard, its general purpose is to teach one how to live WITH the condition(s) instead of eliminating it/them.

Right now, I'm losing a battle (and losing badly) between numerous anti-depressants and my anxiety/depression. Nothing's working. The only times I don't want to sob uncontrollably and crawl into a hole and never come out are when I'm sleeping. I rarely enjoy doing anything I normally like to do, so it's all but an impossibility for me to actually motivate myself to do something I *don't* want to do.

Point is, I can't possibly fathom living with this and not feeling psychologically crippled. Living a normal life where I don't neglect my own personal hygiene, sleep 16 hours a day, and spend all my free time alone in a two-story house, brooding in the basement with all the lights off since it's the only room that doesn't have windows.

Living with something that turned me into a prisoner of my own psyche is not something I can understand. It doesn't make sense and it doesn't seem possible-- as such, I feel like trying it would be a waste of time and money.

Could someone try to convince me otherwise? 









  Seeing D-Bry still lose his temper and attack Big Show, even though Big Show didn't want to fight, and watching him not understanding or accepting HBK's apology is still in line with this theory.

This is actually a really good point. I did find it odd that Bryan was acting like such a dick towards Big Show, backstage and in the ring, after it was announced that they had a match against one another.

But even if Bryan should actually be viewed as a heel, what does that make The Authority? Mega heel? 




  My question to you is this: why is it okay for Shawn to let his emotions get the better of him, but not Bryan?

It's not okay in the context of superkicking Bryan, but it's understandable in my opinion.

Bryan losing his cool and putting Michaels in the Yes Lock is less understandable because not only was he lashing out at the wrong person (Shawn isn't the one who's making Bryan's life a living Hell), but he essentially started the chain reaction during that moment.

1. Michaels politely and humbly asks Bryan to accept his apology, face-to-face, man-to-man

2. Bryan refuses without saying anything. We don't know if he's being a smart ass, or if he's just upset overall and not at Michaels. His lack of communication is key. Instead of just shaking his head, saying something probably would have helped. This is where the chain reaction of emotional turmoil begins.

3. Shawn Michaels lashes out verbally because he feels like Bryan is making a fool of him. No one else who cost Bryan the WWE Championship has done anything even close to apologizing, but Shawn felt like he was doing the right thing, and Bryan STILL acts rebellious when it probably wasn't called for.

4. Daniel Bryan lashes out physically, as I said (and I don't mean that sardonically), at the wrong person. Sure, Shawn said some things that maybe he didn't mean or at the very least shouldn't have said. But it appears that Michaels and Bryan are friends, or at the very least, have a close teacher/student relationship. It's not like Shawn is some random guy-- you'd think Bryan would have it in him to forgive him for everything from the superkick to the verbal tongue-lashing (which, again, was a result of Bryan's stubbornness). 




  to say that he humbled himself before Bryan, is, simply put, inaccurate.

The reason I agreed with HBK saying that he was humbling himself is because he was apologizing in front of millions of fans. Apologizing basically means "I was wrong. Please forgive me." Shawn Michaels is the legend of all legends. He could have attempted to save face, and not publicly admit that he significantly screwed up, by apologizing to Bryan in private, but he chose not to.

 He basically told Bryan that he was not an "A+ player" and that he was not good enough to be in the ring with Shawn. That is not humble.

He only said that to Bryan after he had become frustrated with his attitude. You can't blame him. Sure, maybe Triple H and Stephanie have it out for him. Maybe Randy Orton isn't the rightful WWE Champion. Maybe all of those people hate Daniel Bryan and want to make his life miserable. Sure. But Shawn Michaels is not one of those people. As I said, his actions weren't out of spite or hatred. It wasn't Michaels lashing out at Bryan with the superkick as much as it was defending Triple H. Shawn would have kicked the hell out of damn near ANYONE had they done that to Triple H in front of him.

He was torn between his student and (metaphorically) his brother. That's an easy choice to make if you ask me. 




 I feel like this woman was probably a fan of the saying "Do as I say, not as I do." 




 As I said in the title, everything below is in kayfabe, even some stuff that is part of kayfabe and real life (like Shawn Michaels' rocky relationship with the WWF in the late 90s). I'd really like it to stay that way, if you guys don't mind. Please, no responses along the lines of "Because that's what the writers came up with," etc.

Now, in my opinion, it's obvious here that amongst the four people in the title, Daniel Bryan is the face, while Triple H and Orton are clear heels, and Shawn Michaels appears to be on his way or has already turned heel.

Michaels' pseudo-heel turn is what interests me the most. Shawn Michaels and Triple H are best friends in kayfabe. They're as close as the closest of brothers. So when Shawn Michaels saw Daniel Bryan assault Triple H (perhaps having NOT seen Hunter shove Bryan halfway across the ring), he reacted on emotion and retaliated with some Sweet Chin Music.

At that point, he probably realized that the decision was not the best one he could have made, but he also realized something else that was very important-- **the match was still going on, and he promised the fans that there would be a WWE Champion by the time the match was over.**

Orton took advantage of Bryan being laid out from the superkick and pinned him immediately. Michaels knew he had to count Bryan down or else he would have had to live with himself as having lied to the fans (or being mistaken, but he probably would consider that as bad as a lie).

The next night on Raw, Michaels explained to Bryan that he superkicked him because he felt the need to defend his best friend. HBK even explained why he reacted the way he did-- during Shawn's "darkest days" (when nearly the entire locker room hated him, he had severe drug issues, and he was just, simply put, an asshole), Triple H was the only person by his side. That is **extremely significant.** That type of loyalty (that Triple H showed) is the type you repay til death. Michaels probably feels like he owes Hunter his life, so the least he could do is come to his defense when he gets the sucker-punch equivalent of a hard knee to the face.

This, in my opinion, doesn't *justify* Michaels' actions towards Bryan at the end of the match, but it makes them understandable. Shawn Michaels brought up an aspect of his past that he probably doesn't like to talk about, just so Bryan could understand why he did what he did. He apologized, and offered Bryan a handshake. He refused.

At that point, Michaels got frustrated, understandably (in my opinion). He was correct in saying that he, Daniel Bryan's trainer, a Hall-of-Famer, and possibly the greatest wrestler of all time, humbled himself on international television and asked for only a handshake in return.

Shawn even did this, which may be me looking too much into this, but I can't help it-- **he took the Lord's name in vain** when he used the phrase "For the love of God!" after his emotions had overflowed.

I've followed Shawn Michaels' career extremely closely since his return in 2002, and I don't think I've EVER heard him do that during a promo, interview, etc (on WWE television). Shawn Michaels is very religious and very *serious* about his religion-- I doubt that he would do something like that unless he was extremely passionate about what he said, and more importantly, unless he meant it to the fullest possible extent.

Bryan's response? A feigned handshake whose only purpose was to set Michaels up to be locked in an extremely painful submission hold. Again, seemed (to me) to be the equivalent of a "sucker punch." Michaels could not have seen it coming and had almost zero chance of defending himself before the hold was applied.

In my opinion, Michaels was right that Bryan was being self-righteous and not showing Michaels the respect he deserved. Shawn Michaels did NOT do what he did at Hell in a Cell out of animosity or hatred-- he had neither towards Bryan (if anything, the complete opposite). He did it because in defense of someone for whom he'd probably take a bullet without hesitation.

Daniel Bryan apparently can't/didn't understand that, or has more anger issues than we realized (which is saying a lot).

Thoughts? 









 I'm looking at you, "Snickers wrapper for a condom" people. 




 I assume the male lion watches over the other cubs who aren't being moved?

I don't know anything about lion culture :-( 




 That is the most adorable goddamned thing I've ever seen in my entire life. 




 Maybe I shouldn't have used that exact phrasing. But, when observing and honoring the dead, they have parties and parades and whatnot. A lot of people in other cultures probably couldn't even imagine that on a day dedicated to those who have passed away. 




 Right, I wasn't saying that you should be offended by El Dia De Los Muertos, but just look at how their viewpoint is so much different from the typical American viewpoint. Some people would be extremely freaked out that people would actually have a party (in stark contrast to somber funerals which are the norm here) on behalf of the deceased.

Maybe this is his first time dealing with the death of someone close to him, and he never thought about the things you're saying.

And honestly, I'm not trying to condemn you or anything. I'm actually extremely intrigued by the dichotomy of the two contrasting mindsets here. 




  He should really put his hands on it like a grown up.

If by "it," you mean "his mother's body," you should reconsider. That would be EXTREMELY difficult for a lot of people. Two of the three people I was ever closest to (my mother and my cousin) both passed away in the last ten years. Each funeral was open-casket, but I never went in for the viewing. I couldn't bear it. I'm not even squeamish-- it just would have devastated me emotionally.

Now, that's just from a visual perspective. Imagine having to actually make physical contact with the body of a person you once loved, knowing that now it's nothing but a lifeless cadaver. Its nature and its lifelessness represents the fact that you will never, ever speak to this person or have them speak to you again. It represents their suffering, your suffering, and the suffering of anyone who will miss her.

The human body also loses body heat during death, which I'm sure you know. Touching the body of a deceased person, and feeling cold instead of warmth, would probably feel extremely eerie, since when you make physical contact with a living person, you can feel the warmth of their body. It would be spooky.

Like I said in another comment, I agree with what you're saying, but I don't think it's necessarily as black-and-white as you're implying. 




 I understand that what he said may have offended you (hell, it offended me a little bit, and I'm generally not like that-- maybe it's because I lost my mother at 13), but it might not just be that he's a disrespectful dick by nature. Maybe that's how they feel in the culture he's from.

A good example is the culture of some Spanish-speaking countries. They celebrate a day called Dia De Los Muertos (The Day of the Dead). They *celebrate* death. They don't look at it with the stigma and negativity that we do in America.

I'm not saying the OP is in that boat exactly, but maybe he just grew up learning that a person and the body that holds them are two completely separate entities and should be treated as such.

I guess maybe it's kind of like when someone passes away, and you don't know what to do with their belongings. You probably have to give them away or throw them out eventually, and that's not really viewed as being as bad as what OP said. But he (or she, I'm honestly not sure) might look at it the same way-- that his mother's body is merely her own property, and once she's done using it, it no longer represents her.

Know what I mean? I hope I explained that well. I just feel like, while I agree with what you say, it would help to try to think of what his thought process might be and maybe it might be a little more logical than you first thought. 




 I also love how Cole, earlier in the match, filled us in that Big E can't win the title if he loses by countout.

Thank you, Cole. 




 I think you did. But I don't know if I did.

Did I? 




 [Heels, faces, and Kane. Chokeslammed Miz for no reason after fighting off Rowan and Harper.](/spoiler) 




 "TURN ME AROUND!" 




 Thread title refers to the kickoff show, by the way.

... this was a planned work, and it's because they fired the six people on the technical/production team (that Triple H talked about on SmackDown)?

Mind. Blown. 




 I've always wanted to wear a steel chain around my neck. For no reason other than the fact that I love the sound that thick chain-link steel makes when it rattles against itself.

But it's impractical. And kinda weird. The former, more than the latter, is the reason I don't do it. Or maybe the reason I haven't done it *yet*. 









 [additional generic positive reinforcement]!

Just kidding, bro. You're awesome for this. It's most definitely a step in the right direction. Overcoming depression is a journey, and a journey is a series of steps. This is a good first step. 









 I've been on public welfare for 2 years (and have been finding it extremely difficult to find work), and I rarely have any cash at all, and if I do, I can't spend it on pizza. 

All I want is some pizza. Subsisting entirely on peanut butter sandwiches and tasteless cereal isn't fun. If anyone is generous enough to offer, I'll even reimburse you with interest when I get back on my feet.

Thanks. 









 Scumbag brain: Dude, don't listen to that first thought. You don't want to do anything. And if you try, I'll make you miserable. 









 Got any recommendations? 




 I like his character, but I just think he goes too far with it a lot of times. You can tell that JBL and Cole get into serious arguments about JBL not making sense or being biased, because Cole is annoyed.

Also, Cole sometimes has to talk over JBL to call the match. Color commentators don't call the match, but they're supposed to know when to shut up so the play-by-play commentator *can* call the match. 




 I agree that they can do whatever they like with their own life, but I wish suicidal people would have more faith in the fact that killing oneself is not the only way to end the pain. 




 I assumed that it would be more convenient, since the wireless network I have set up was on a Netgear router.

Or would I still be able to connect to that network with any brand of router? 




 Apparently, their football team is a fraud. 









 CBT = Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for those who don't know. I didn't know what it was until a week ago.

Anyway, I know that health care providers have a hotline, but I don't talk to anyone, so I generally don't even bother to buy minutes on my (pre-paid) phone. I'm not made of money as it is, so I try to save whenever I can.

Is there a website I can visit to find a CBT provider in my area that would be covered by my health insurance? I tried a Google search and couldn't find anything.

Thanks. 




 I think Account_Eliminator changed my original title (which was kinda long). I was gonna ask him about the name of the wiki being counterintuitive, but... I'm lazy. 




 These comments have taught me much about proper bacon preparation.

I thank thee, Reddit. 




 When you use the left click, Windows will decide for you whether it moves or copies, and sometimes, it doesn't choose the one you want, and you might not feel like going to the toolbar, selecting "Copy/Move to Folder," and then finding the destination you want.

Instead, just drag the file to another window exactly was you would with the left click, but use the right click this time. When you drag it and release the click, it will give you an option of "Copy Here," "Move Here," or "Create Shortcut Here."

Very handy, at least for me. I got sick of screaming "I DON'T WANT TO COPY IT, I WANT TO MOVE IT!" at my computer screen. 




 Isn't attempted suicide still technically considered a crime? I swear I heard that somewhere. 









 That's fair. I did want to make it clear that I don't know for sure, so I used the word "assume." People correcting me (no hard feelings to anyone) should realize that I'm not blind nor do I know anyone who is. So it was more or less an educated guess.

I can live with being wrong. 




 But those movies are actually professionally produced, aren't made up of 99% unrealistic dialogue, and are largely considered entertaining.

None of these applies to this rage comic. 




 Unless they're Matt Murdock 




 Not sure if implying cat is coworker.

If so... awesome.

If not... still awesome. 




 I get the feeling the OP watched the first 30 minutes or so of the Daredevil movie from 2003. 




  Not everyone who loses their sight has always been blind.

But the customer in the comic says that he's been blind since birth. "Seeing" should be completely foreign to him, and I assume he wouldn't use the word often, if ever. 




 Solution: Move to Hawaii and wake up drenched with sweat in the middle of December. 




 Uh... why would a blind person tell you "I don't **see** it"? 




 You're awesome. 




 You'd be doing me a favor tbqh.

Could you do your best to timestamp the videos to the time when the spot occurred, though? 




 But, simultaneously, she is much less likely to become mad with rabies. 




 http://data3.whicdn.com/images/23178357/homer-bush_large.gif

Question, though-- what are the rules regarding what's worthy of a Wiki and what isn't? I was gonna make another one for trivia of a certain wrestler; little things that I noticed about his character/history that I don't see people ever bring up.

Fair game? 




 Phew. I thought you guys were gonna come after me and break my kneecaps.

Seriously though, thanks for the heads-up. 




 I hope this type of post isn't against the rules. If it is, I apologize.

As for the Wiki, feel free to add to the list as you see fit-- adding/correcting listings, linking to videos of certain instances, etc. 









 It's definitely a thing. It's all a matter of where you live.

I hate when people say something "isn't a thing" just because it doesn't exist where they live. Your neighborhood isn't the entire planet. 




 I don't think he failed. Not being as popular in WWE as he was in WCW isn't a "failure."

He got more and more popular as time went on in WWE. The crowd was at least 50/50 against him at Backlash against The Rock, but then eventually he was very over. 




 An old wives' tale about how one could write something, print out a physical copy, and mail it to him/herself. This would allegedly be as good as an official copyright, and keep others from plagiarizing your work without ramifications.

I honestly can't remember why it was supposed to work.

**EDIT:** [Wikipedia explains it nicely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_man%27s_copyright) 




 The "poor man's copyright" myth. 




 _ Since when does anything in wrestling work the way it would in real life?

If you even look at a referee wrong in the NBA, you're gonna get thrown out of a game. Meanwhile, in kayfabe, WWE officials fear for their lives every time a heel gets a near fall. 




 That's another really good one. Honestly, a lot of Last Man Standing matches have had brilliant strategical finishes. 




 For those who don't remember/don't feel like watching, Vince McMahon put a clause in a PPV-match contract which stated that Triple H and Austin could not have any physical contact with one another until they met at No Way Out, or the instigator would be suspended for six months.

After both men went over the contract and signed it, Triple H beat the piss out of Austin, and everybody (including JR and King) was confused as hell as Triple H eventually laid out Austin with a Pedigree.

When Vince told him that he had just gotten himself suspended, Triple H revealed that he had never signed the contract (but Austin *had* signed), and thus Triple H was not legally bound by the "No contact" clause. On top of THAT, the fact that Austin had already signed meant that he could not retaliate against Triple H for the assault without being suspended.

Even Vince McMahon, the consummate evil genius himself, couldn't help but smile when he realized what Triple H had pulled off. "Cerebral Assassin" indeed.

This all led to Stephanie getting a Stunner the next week, but still. _ 









 I think assaulting AJ would get him more pop than heat. 




  the fans on your laptop.

How do I do that?

 Also, bring up device manager, and see if there are any yellow triangles beside anything

Only something called "Broadcom USH." Says drivers aren't installed for it. 




 My laptop fans or the fans on my cooler? 




 * [General computer specifications](http://2.imgland.net/zHOJep.png)
* [Processor specs](http://2.imgland.net/VE9cpo.png)
* [Graphics card specs](http://2.imgland.net/9qTfmE.png)

As you can see, the graphics card (which, having researched, I believe is notorious for overheating) all but flame broils my motherboard. Sometimes I want to watch movies or sports games on my laptop, but I can't, because it'll overheat to the point that the CPU Usage skyrockets to 100, and the processor struggles to perform simple tasks (much less play a video) until it cools down.

It doesn't just happen with 720p HD or higher. It'll struggle with 540p, or even 360p sometimes.

I clean the vents regularly, I have a laptop cooler that definitely aids in lowering the temperature (having noted the differences between using it and not using it, each for weeks at a time), and I still have this problem.

Is there anything I can do to make it so that I at least have a chance of getting through the first half of a basketball game without my laptop exploding? 




 What medication was it, if you know, that caused the cancer? I'm taking Pentasa and Omeprazole right now, and I just recently stopped taking Prednisone (it's a steroid, so they don't want people taking it long-term). 




 As someone who has Crohn's Disease, you have now officially scared the shit out of me.

Pun intended. 




 You sure the nostalgia of a Heyman/Van Dam alliance wouldn't garner some cheers? 




 Ah, that's the incident when he arrived at the PPV high as all hell, I assume. 




 Elaborate for those of us who don't watch TNA? 




 There are places you can download it after it airs (and you can even download SmackDown before it airs). 




 Just for clarification, everything here is occurring in the present. Current Rob Van Dam in current WWE.

Give it your best shot, r/SquaredCircle. 




 Will this stop random question marks showing up whenever I c/p YouTube comments into an AIM IM box? 




 Ah, okay. I understand. 




 I just purchased an Xbox Live Gold 48-hour code on eBay, and (in case you aren't aware) not leaving positive feedback for excellent service is strongly discouraged.

I didn't leave feedback despite getting the code within minutes of buying it, because I hadn't used it, since I was waiting for a friend to get his own Gold subscription. I explained this to the seller, promised to leave positive feedback as soon as I used the code, and he gave me a free one to use while I wait for my friend.

People are awesome sometimes. 









  Nowadays, I don't know how much unhealthy foods prevent people from having kids

No, not necessarily that, but cases where an unhealthy diet causes a person to die before they're able to reproduce. 




 I tried searching, and couldn't find anything on this sub.

Couldn't our taste buds have "evolved" to prefer foods that are good for us (vegetables as opposed to chocolate, for example)? The laws of nature state that a species which chooses to damage itself consistently (or cannot avoid doing so) isn't fit to survive, right? Wouldn't enjoying the taste of healthy food help ensure our survival?

It seems similar to a situation where a zebra wandered regularly into an area where a bunch of lions roam, for no reason other than that it enjoys being in that area. Eventually, after a whole bunch of zebras get mauled, the other zebras would get the idea, wouldn't they? They'd stop going there, they'd keep their offspring from going there so the species can continue on, etc.

I'm no biology expert, so if I have anything wrong, please feel free to tell me exactly what. Just be nice. Please? 




 That's goddamn amazing. At that point, I might consider those people more family than friends. 




 :-( Nope. The relationship (we were never official) lasted about 4 minutes. _

Obviously exaggerating :P, but yeah. She didn't feel like I was worth committing to, partly I guess because she didn't think we were compatible, and also because she was an extremely studious pharmacology major.

I don't resent her for it at all. I'm just a little upset I lost her. She was my dream girl, and I got her number accidentally.

That's like a downer ending to a bad romance movie. 




 I posted this a while back, but I love telling the story:

I worked at an "information desk" in a big building (basically a study/eating area for students, and a meeting place for the top university employees-- managers, execs, etc.) on a college campus about three years ago.

One day, an attractive young lady around my age asked me where the cookie shop in the building is. I directed her to it, and she thanked me.

After she left, I realized I should have made a move, and I hated myself for not doing so.

Then, I saw her later that day. I waved to her. She waved back and smiled. I motioned for her to come to the desk.

I asked her, plain and simple, "Could I call you some time?" She said sure and gave me her phone number.

One day while we were chatting about a week later, I asked her what kind of cookie she went to get the first time I saw her. She had no idea what I was talking about.

**Because she wasn't the same girl I had seen initially.** 









 My fave, that I heard recently:

"I'll be damned if I repent." 









 "I'll lay you out over some beef like sesame seeds."- Chamillionaire 




 I love you for getting the reference. 




 That must get boring. 




 How do we know that's not some sort of super mutated giant pencil? HUH?!

 Stop posting GIFs! You expect me to click on it?! That's tougher than looking before you sit! 




 _ At least if you don't look when you cross the street, a vehicle will usually stop before it hits you.

The toilet, however, gives approximately zero fucks. 




 And then even if I don't look, I check the seat with my hands (I know, gross-- I use soap when I'm done), and if I don't feel the seat, I don't sit.

There are lots of ways around this. You'd think women would be *better* at it since they always sit when they use the bathroom. 









 He was a face (I think-- I'm pretty sure he was still "The Viper"), and he was feuding with CM Punk. He came to the ring and the lights dimmed like they do for certain wrestlers' promos (The Rock, Kane, Undertaker, etc.). At that point, he cut a psychotic promo about, amongst other things, how CM Punk will sip his meals through a straw after Orton's done with him.

That's the only part I can distinctly remember. I'm also 99% sure it was on Raw. Does anyone have a link to the video of this promo?

Thanks. 




 The Celtics were terrible offensively and were almost just as bad defensively without Russell. I don't see how they could have possibly won without Russell unless there was a megastar in his place (and even then, they wouldn't win 11). 




 I assume that if people agree that Russell is GOAT-tier and Top 5/Top 3/whatever, they already know everything I'm going to post. 




 I wanted to know if people agree or not, and if they don't, I'd try to convince them.

Why the fuck would I waste 20 minutes composing a long post that (in the event that most people agreed with me) would essentially be saying "In my opinion, the sky is blue"? 




 The only reason I didn't write an entire CMV-like post is because I wasn't sure if it would be necessary, if people already agreed with me. 




 So if the rules change, you can't compare? That's just silly. Like I've said already, if you know enough about basketball, you'll know how to properly weigh the extenuating circumstances and judge a player properly relative to his era.

Russell played against worse teams/players, but accomplished things no one else ever will. Jordan's 6 Finals MVPs or five league MVPs or 10 straight scoring titles can or have been equaled/surpassed. I seriously doubt anyone is going to win 11 championship as the best player on his team, or have the type of defensive impact on the entire league that Russell did. 




 Enough what?

"Enough OP being open-minded and welcoming arguments and accepting that others feel differently"?

"Enough OP using facts to support his opinions"?

"Enough OP getting downvoted for no reason"? 




 Who the hell said you can't compare the games? I said I agree that they're NOT THE SAME.

Holy Jesus. 




 Have you seen the statistical defensive impact he had on the league, and more importantly, for his team?

Not only should the "In my opinion" fragment negate any thoughts of me thinking my argument is fact and indisputable, but if you look at the numbers, I'd say they favor "clearly has a case" more than not. 




 Make it clear for me? I just said that when you compare the 90s and the 60s, they're clearly not the same. When you COMPARE. I've also said, in many other comments, that it's very possible to compare across eras.

And I never said Russell was playing against "chumps." Again, I have said that he made Wilt Chamberlain look like a scrub compared to what the man was truly capable of.

Finally, Wilt Chamberlain was nowhere near Russell's level as a player. Only people who use stats and nothing else think that.
