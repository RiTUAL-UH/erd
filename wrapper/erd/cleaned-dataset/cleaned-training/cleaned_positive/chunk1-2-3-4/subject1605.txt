Bartender comes back a little bit later and since its a pretty slow night, he decides to chit-chat with the customer. After a little bit the bartender asks the man what he does for a living. 

Customer says, "I'm a Center for the Dallas Cowboys."

Bartender replies, "Man, it must be really tough having to do that."

"Its not too bad. I enjoy it" 

"No, I meant being openly gay in Texas."

 I know its a bit out of context for a lot of us, however I've been mostly free for a bit now, though I feel lie I'm starting to fall into depression again. (Bi-polar II / manic depressive since I was a kid.) 

Back story; Met a lovely lady a year (around abouts) ago at a mutual friend's birthday party. Nice woman, perhaps a bit drunk, talked a while, facebook friends later. 

Get to talking, she's pretty cool, works in graphic design, responds positively to advances, sexual exchanges including suggestive photographs even though she's in a relationship (I knew) plus she's 13 years older (I'm mature, she's immature). 

We continue talking, life, love, sex all that, advances that she reciprocates to the extent of still being with someone. (Nothing ever happened though it very well could have. Yes, I know. Cheats with you, cheats on you.)

Around her birthday, her BF dumps her, kicks her out, for reasons that she either didn't tell me or he never told her. After a while she agrees to go to lunch with me and then the next week come over and let me make her dinner and watch a movie with drinks. 

Week later, she has to skip dinner because she said she found out he cheated on her and was feeling sick as a result, then tells me later that week she has started seeing someone and that she is confused why I would be upset about this as she told me she couldn't date someone who worked at a bar or who was younger. 

I didn't take this as she thought I would, and that she thought she made that clear before. Back and forth for a few weeks, things said in anger and with inhibition on both sides. 

Anyway, I get past that, ask her how its going, blah blah blah, ask her about her drinking. 

She says she stopped a few weeks ago. (lightbulb) I say good that she stopped drinking so much as it elt like half the times I talked to her she had been. 

And of course, it appears she was. 

Fucking of course, clearly no one could be interested in me unless they were drunk half the time. I don't even know why I try. 

This is more of a rant about the slide of someone with the history of depression than the life of, But, IDFC shit happens.

 I was diagnosed when I was 11. Every step I have taken since has tightened the noose around my neck. High School was easy, living with the possibility of escape in alcohol is difficult. I'm 27. I work as a bouncer in a club. I might be good at it, but the discount on drinks is worth even more. I work 3 nights a week, and the nights I'm off, I spend $40-80 on cheap whiskey. 

Ever wonder what life is like when you have barriers no one will break?

I like to call it The Slide. You know its happening, you know why, but there isn't a damn thing you can do about it.

Do you know what its like to ask for help and the only response you get is silence? Ever wonder what life is like when you ask yourself if you have to kill someone to fucking notice?

Something the size of a pen that could detect what color something is. You'd put it up to the color you want to 'collect' and you could store like 500 or so colors. Then you could hook it up to a computer and you would see all the different colors you caught and the hex code and the Pantone or other companies info on the color. 

There would be different levels of product- RGB or CMYK; 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 captures; how nice the pen looks (like a nice fountain pen); bluetooth connectivity to your tablet or phone so you can check the color if you'd like. 



















 I've been working on a campaign for a local candidate and I needed to find a way to describe him in a tagline.

 I had a motorcycle accident when I was 19. I saw her crossing the traffic, I had the right of way, she just pulled in front of me. Nothing I could do. 

I lived in Florida at the time and the only thing that went through my head was "I hope she has insurance." I was wearing my helmet and it's a good thing I was because there's no graceful way to land when you flip head first over and 35 feet past a car. 

Broke my clavicle and needed surgery, its a good thing she had insurance otherwise I would have been fucked for years. FHP at the hospital told me I was lucky, most of the motorcycle accidents he saw were deaths or in so much pain they couldn't answer questions.

 What kind of maggot gives people gold for puns? 




 Example:

The bar I used to work at Served Evan Williams Green Label at $3.50 a drink. Retail A fifth is ~$10.00. IF you get 20 servings from a bottle, 3.50 x 20 = 70. That's a 700% markup. Until you factor in rent, electric, maintenance, labor (and this really depends on location) etc, that bottle is 2-3x as expensive. 

The markup for anything is a significant amount, if you don't include overhead. 




 Ahh, drummer jokes.

 Accidental overdose maybe. Aderall, Ritalin, etc are considerably more safe than legal opioids or cocaine. 

Having used these types of drugs, you would have to experience considerable pain before you do major damage to yourself. 




 Well, didn't Aston make a shitty hatchback? 




 I've had about half a fifth of whiskey and it made sense in the manner that you were saying that coke was responsible for many deaths. 

Though, going back, I understand you were saying that legal amphetamines were responsible for many deaths, and on that I would have to disagree wholesale. The numbers do not suggest that RX amphetamines are killing remarkably large numbers of people.

 It depends on if you have a citizen working that tile after the improvement is completed. Citizen management can be adjusted if you click on the city and look at the drop down menu on the right.

If your city is not well fed, the ai may choose to put a citizen on a farm before hills or a mine. Or, if you have bonuses to tiles that may seem more useful. (Like if you have the sacred path pantheon with give +1 to jungle tiles.) 

Long answer short, yes your worker will likely be produced sooner, but if you want to make sure, citizen management in the the city screen is a good reference.

 It's more the idea that you have taken a pain reliever boosts its perceived ability upwards of half. 

So, if you took a sugar pill and was told it was tylenol or whatever, you would have some reduction in pain. Likewise, if you took a pill and were told it was a sugar pill, the pain reduction would be diminished. 

And this study was for OTC pain relievers, not opioids.  




 I saw a study that said ~43% of statistics are made up on the spot.  




 Saw a study that suggested upwards of 50% of a pain reliever's effect was placebo, people expecting it to work. 

So even if it does nothing, it could still do something. 




 Why would you... the fuck is wrong with you dude?

 Its not that Reddit actually hates these people, its that we think uptight, humorless, food-Germans are fun to make fun of.

 Pool and arcade games. I'll whip your ass in pool.

C'mon, what else are you doing on the friday night after Christmas?

I'll be there around 10. 




 Right? Super cheap.  




 Ramen. yeah, its carbs and shit, but damn if a packet doesn't help out with the bulk in bulking. 

Plus it's fucking cheap. 




 I'm new to Knoxville area, and I'm head to Urban in Oldtown tonight. 

Let's hangout! 




 I'm in Knoxville and heading to Urban tonight. 

Find me, I'll be the fat/tall guy at the bar drinking whiskey coke. 




 I wish I had waited and bought whiskey. But it's ok, I'm going out tonight.  




 Can someone translate this for me?

I'm just... I don't have the fucks to give to figure it out. 




 And here's how! 




 Ya'll are awesome. 

Also tall women are super awesome! 




 You aren't rich enough. 




 She's like a female equivalent of James, Chris or Steve.

Fucking dicks, the lot of them.

What did you say about mathematically impossible? 




 Its actually a brilliant move. They drown out competition, increase consumer confidence so they buy those big trucks again, and when the prices go back up there will still be competition, but the price will be even higher, allowing them to step in and buy the companies supplying the tar sands type oil. 

I mean yeah there's some niche shit to it, but damn, I hope they use lube on us later. Of course it might be too expensive. 




 No. But the level at which they decide to produce does have a direct effect on prices, in a less supply = higher prices way. 




 You just made a statement where you contradict yourself and that example is crap. 

Just so you know. 
 




 Holy shit. 




 I like pizza and cheap tvs. Deal with it ya damn hippie. 




 How do you figure? Instability equals a much less stable market. One government falling in the region has a huge impact on the market price for oil. 

And no serious coalition will form, its like herding cats, who have guns. 




 Back in my day we only had 3 channels and we liked it that way.

Seriously though, at least House was on, daytime TV is shit. 




 My point was more of once the oil prices start going back up hard to reach oil like the tar sands is going to become a viable source again. 

"Which could count as a geopolitical win in the Mid East region." 

We want that region as stable as possible, the fracturing of Iraq is the perfect example. Removing the leaders of a country with that many different tribes and sects all wanting the money is insane. 




 Eh, its a body part. Can get mixed up in the process. 




 Ugh. Conspiracy theories are so stupid. 




 Apparently some people have a misunderstanding of what Foul Bachelor Frog is all about. 




 A safeword should be a calm sounding word. Not too many hard consonants. 

And should always be something that doesn't fit the situation. Like 'Chicago' or something. 









 It's a delaying of the inevitable. I do think the Saudis are trying to drive the competition away, but as long as there is money to be made... 

Another aspect people don't get is that unless the US subsidizes oil in a serious manner, we will still be effected. Oil goes to market first, then it ends up at the consumer.  




 Points for front end down force on FWD?

I mean, it looks like shit, but in theory it should work better than a freaking spoiler.

 You think that was a personal attack? 

I'm genuinely curious, because you clearly aren't understanding what's being said. 




 Is English your second language or some shit? 

Because you clearly have no idea what is going on here. 




 Oh Jesus. "The look what she was wearing" argument is blaming a woman for being raped because of what she was wearing akin to your statement that posting a picture of yourself on the internet is inviting creepers.

 For me, its those little moments of just being free while driving around at night. Or being bundled up on the couch when its raining outside. 

The stupid simple shit is what I live for because I know I can't change the big stuff. I'll never be able to stop wars or even get people to not drive like asshats. 

I'll probably never have children or a real family because I'm so fucked, but that's OK. Its not something I can truly control. 




 Crazy shit happens in florida. 




 I'm just curious. 

It does seem like units from a previous era cost more (the same as current era units.) 

Like a Gatling gun costs the same per turn as a machine gun. 




 Clearly there is no point in arguing with you, as any rational thought is lost on you. 

Good luck, don't have kids. 




 I think you skipped over the seek professional help bit. 

And yes, I do know what's up.

They either pay, or the asshole leaves.  




 Is it xp farming or something? 









 I'm on windows home premium and the snipping tool won't do it. 


Idk. I'm not sober enough to deal with this. 


TL;DR shit is shitty. 




 OK, so I just tried it in Photoshop CS5 and Windows Paint.  

Both times I got just a dark gray canvas. My settings are all the way down because that is the only way I can run civ. Do you think that matters or am I doing some thing wrong? 

EDIT: I really do have the city settled as described, and I don't want a bullshitter label. I just don't know how to screenshot without having a steam account.

I hit the print screen tab on my comp when I'm in civanf then I hitalt+tab and go to paint or an opened up Photoshop.  




 What difficulty level do you play? 




 Is there a hotkey for that of what? 

I'm just not sure entirely sure with my HP. 




 Within the three tile range is as follows; 

3 silk
2 salt
1 citrus
1 mountain within 2 of a city
1 banana
1 Deer
Lake Victoria
3 Horses
A metric fuckton of forest and jungle
On a river
And a partrige in a pear tree.

I really wish I could show you a screenshot but I'm not on steam and the graphics settings are at a minimum.

 How are you doing? I hope you're well. 

What do you like to drink? I'm generally a bourbon kinda guy, slow words, quick mind kinda dude. 

How's your Sunday night/Monday morning going? 




 I generally only build units when I've been dow'd. Then I just sit back and let the waves of bodies fall at the base of my walls. 




 When I was playing as warlord, I would go america and just build a massive navy. The ai could never get that shit right.

I might need to after a while.

 On the real though, if you were a nearby, available and willing chick... 




 Do you see my username? 

Do you really think punishment is a bad thing? 




 So you're saying I shouldn't vote for you? 




 The fact that I can imagine these things in great detail and not be weirder out is probably a bad thing right? 




 I personally stay as neutral as possible. DoF with anyone who isn't at war with someone and let the shit hit when ideologies come around. 

Generally though, I even stay friends with people who have a different ideology.  




 What is the main reason you declare war? A certain technology discovered? Religion conversion? Forward settling? GPT? 

EDIT: I wish there was a "Go funk yourself" option to responding to trade offers. 




 It would be a hell of a lot quicker.

I'd take a continuous stream of rock salt before spiders. 




 Babylon- Order- Making like 15 gpt because that fucking french asshat is just swamping me with shitty units and there aren't any good trade routes. 




 I'm going to go out on a limb and say there probably isn't any damn uranium either. 

Also, fuck autocratic napoleon neighbor.

 One time I asked a girl to dance and she acted like I wasn't even there, and I only avoided asking people to dance for a whole month. 




 It'd be nice... 




 I don't think you'd enjoy that. 




 I know it's kind of hard to hear when you're up on your high horse, but I think you'd be better able to understand if you came down for like a minute. 




 Boom. 




 I was mostly going with Nazi is generally referred to as being German, so I was more or less asking what the Portuguese fascist party equivalent would be. Because of your flair. 




 It seems like the late 20's early 30's had sweeping fascism across Europe.  




 What's the Portuguese version of a Grammar Nazi? 




 Well, you go from writing the date a lot in 2012 to not writing the date a lot ever since. Like they finished school or changed over to a digital timesheet. 




 What are you on about? 




 The more influential you are over a civ with a different ideology, the less happy they are due to your influence.  




 If you have enough influence over them then a city can flip over to your control via a revolt. 




 US bombs UK. 

Australia is like wtf m8? 




 I dunno, I don't really want to have to deal with sjw nuts freaking out about slavery and whatnot for a game I really enjoy. 




 I'd like to see revolution like a civil war. Your cities can break off into another civ. Same UU UA and UB but with a Revolutionary Leader. 

I think that would be pretty damn cool. Flex number of empires would be a nice feature in general. Oh, this is a peaceful game and everyone is basically trying for a culture victory? Well, here's Attila or some other war civ. 




 I would make the supply line separate from the traditional trade route in that it doesn't really provide gpt for either. Maybe +1-2 for the owner. 

And I like the idea of supply lines because it allows for the FOBs.  




 So I've seen some good ideas to make war a bit more realistic, and it seems that most revolve around units. I have a few ideas that might change the mechanics of war.

Supply lines. Acts like a trade route to friendly cities that boosts military unit production and maybe city defenses. You could prop a city state to defend itself against another civ or a frontier city. 

Forward operating base. Much like a citadel without the adjacent damage, grants 75% defensive bonus and can be removed. If a supply line is attached it allows you to upgrade adjacent units you control for 33% more gold cost.


Unhappiness. For every 5 military units destroyed or captured in foreign lands unhappiness increases by 1. For every 5 enemy military units captured or destroyed in your land happiness increases by 1. The difference is reduced by one per turn after a peace treaty is signed.  




 You could say I learned less that day than if she'd left me alone. 




 Not familiar with the risky click of the day bit are you? 




 Oh man that glasses bit. I'm nearsighted and have glasses for it. In third grade we were reading out of the textbook, to ourselves and I took my glasses off to read. I could read just fine without them. 

However my teacher, who had something against my family, demanded that I put my glasses back on and would not let me reply that I didn't need them to read. 

I've hated that bitch and women who interrupt my sentences ever since.

 Comes with some sort of 'awake' promotion. 




 "Do you even know what "in context" means?"

No, I have no idea at all. 

" I did not grow up in the top 5 percent, although I'm there now for income but not wealth." 

You need to check your privilege. 




 Holy fuck, you are a goddamn moron. Use of examples, you stupid shit, are not the whole but part. 

I have been saying, if you weren't to goddamned retarded to understand, that the top 5% of worldwide equates to like the top half of the US. So the implication that his family was super rich, WHEN HELD IN CONTEXT OF THE FUCKING COMMENT, is not as impressive as you claim it to be, you spineless, over-educated, under a stimulated twat. 




 I'm not discounting that compared to sub-saharan Africa or Amazonian Peru that's impressive, but when you put it in the US, not exactly fantastical. 




 Yes? 




 I always looked at it like this. You have X capacity to deal with crap. So you stuff the important things in and kind of ignore the rest. 

When you don't have to worry about eating, paying bills on time, or if you'll go broke because you have to go to the er to get anti-biotics, then you fill the tank with things that may seem trivial to many. 

Not to mention, if you manage to be worry-free, everyone fucking hates you because why can't I be rich and happy like that asshole. 




  It's crazy his highest passer rating came in 2009 at ~~40~~ 70 years old.

 




 My first comment was 'its not that impressive' and then you get all moral high ground on me, and when I clarify, you think I'm pissed off. 

Is there something bothering you, having a rough day, what?  




 No shit dude, but in the context of your comment, not a big deal. 




 You do realize that top 5% isn't really that impressive. If that were people based he could be the 300 millionth richest person on the planet. That's middle class-ish. 

If you figure the average family is 2 adults, 2.2 kids you have 7 billion/4.2 you get 1 billion 666 million families. Top 5% families is 83.3 million families world-wide. 

Not really that impressive.
