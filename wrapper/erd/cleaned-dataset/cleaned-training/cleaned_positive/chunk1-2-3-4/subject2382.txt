...aaaaaand some unreleased stuff:

[I Am Legion - Make Those Move (Teddy Killerz Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4P_lwiH9Hs)

Also look out for the record label Critical Music. They are putting out some real deep, intelligent but also dark tunes. And they sound more stylized and less muddy and hardcore than most of the dark dnb tracks, what i like. 




 It's not just that she's strong, Diamond plays a pretty mean Shyvana. I spectated some of his games and he was constantly  keeping up with the sololaners level-wise. He even outleveld and outfarmed them and that is pretty amazing as a jungler. His overall playstyle reminded me of Meteos's but a notch higher (cause he's Diamond/#nofanboy #nohomo) 




 How i will manage to watch all the games even though i'll have school:

1. Stay up all the weekend until atleast 6 am and sleep until 5pm. Pretty easy if you're going to get wasted anyway.

2. Wake up around 5pm at sunday, buy a 2l coke and a bunch of energy drinks at the closest gas station and pull an allnighter to watch the first day of games. Don't sleep at all and go to school at 8am.

3. Since you are going to be a zombie at monday evening you can easily go to sleep around 8pm.

4. Wake up at 3-4am at tuesday morning and continue watching the games. I'll probably miss the Fnatic vs Gambit game though since that one starts at 8am. Maybe i can skip the first lesson, not sure about that one yet.

5. Repeat for the whole week.

6. Profit? 
























 Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, The Godfather, Forest Gump, The Lion King

It's pretty bad i know :( 









 Dude that Hochi Remix has a drop like none. Sick!

 Doesn't even have a proper structure or transitions yet so there is lots of room for anybody who wants to work on it.

Also got this techno-ish song in work if that's more fitting.

Just write me a message or something. 




 First of all forgive me for any grammatical mistakes as english is not my mother tongue.


So since years I've played with idea of becoming a pro gamer, to make a living from what i love and do since i'm a child. 
Playing games. Now im 20 years old and life is a bitch these days. 
I never really knew what i wanted to do later on. Parents and friends tell me that i should start a normal career like everybody else. But that always seemed kinda dull to me. I've been playing League for a not too long time now but recently i started to think that i could actually do this. Becoming a pro. Dedicating my whole life on one single thing to become one of the very best. The question that crosses my mind however is if that is actually a realistic and a worthwile goal. 


I know that first of all i would need to get to Challenger to even get noticed by any of the bigger teams. Now I ask myself if anybody who puts enough work into it could achieve that. I know that there are people who are just naturally gifted and have a talent for it but do you really need that to become one of the very best? I wouldn't say i'm untalented but there are certainly a lot of people who are much more talented than me but they might have a worse work ethic. Also is it ridiculous to start a pro gaming career with 20 years of age? Am i already to late to start something that I've always dreamed of?


I know that these are a lot of rhetorical questions but i feel like i just need opinions from other people to confirm that i'm not out of my mind. The thing is i also have nothing to loose really. My social life is subpar as is my graduation. 


So what do you guys think? 




 Amazing times for all People Who are in australia right now. I'm normally from Germany but now i get to see every game in the evening before going to bed. Thanks Based god. 
























 All that this has teached me is that this community is a bunch of sissies like seriously, what exactly is scary about it. 




 What's so bad about this? It's just a spider with a bunch of baby spiders on it's abdomen. Even the person in the video doesn't look scared.

 It's always like this in the early season. Hype gets created and as the season goes on and LCS ends the hype is gone. I mean teams are still figuring out how to optimally play the game so anything can happen and any team can look strong(UoL). Atleast the games are super fun to watch.
