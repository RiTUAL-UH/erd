 I'm pretty new to knitting this scarf and the other Gryffindor one I made are my first creations hah...  I believe I used a 16" round needle for the entire scarf. Used a crochet hook to place the tassels. As for the yarn I just picked two colours I liked of the same thickness. I used different thickness for the Gryffindor one than the slytherin same needles though I prefer my scarves to be knitted in the round that way they are double thick with no ugly side c: I can provide the knitting pattern if anyone is interested.  




 Snake needed an xray c:  




 Nymeria after the dire wolf from asoiaf
And orochi after the dragon for okami c: 









 It's a royal python if anyone wanted to know  









 They do it usually to help shed, mine however goes in there to soak and then she poops lol 




 Well we also sedated him c:  




 We used a bolt cutter to remove it  









 Thanks c: 
 




 I recommend removing all substrate and replacing with paper towel till mites are gone, give all the hides a good wash in scalding water. As for the spray I'd has an ivomec spray and give the snake an ivomec injection if you can it works the best and is easily available at local vet clinics    




 She's a salmon boa and her and her name is Nymeria. This is the first time I've seen her soaking on her own c. 









 I work at a zoo as a veterinary technician and I also do animal husbandry ect. All the animals at my zoo receive a very high level of care. There's very careful guidelines that have to be followed to remain a member of caza! We clean daily, sometimes more then once, feed multiple times and different ways and provide extra enrichment daily as well all the animals I work with daily are very happy and well cared for. Medical issues are dealt with by the veterinarian right away. I can't speak for all zoos but the one I work at is great.  





























 Scared the shit out of me.. Not the bike.  The track, being on one. So nervous i didnt enjoy it. Any advice? 
 









 The 250 i had before was great height. For reference im 5'3.  The 600 is a bit tall for me.  




 Helps when you link me to it ;)  




 I'm the girlfriend and mine is the green one c: 




 We're sexy  




 I didn't enjoy skyward sword at all. In fact I didn't like it so much I never bothered to finish it.  The controls for swimming I thing irritated me the most about it. And all the other bs that came with it. One of my favourites is MM. I can say I've beaten it more then any other one.  But anyway the point is I think I actually hated skyward sword. Wii controls in general I find too flailey and I find myself disliking the entire motion control system. Just my two cents.   




 Horses should be moved down :P 




 woo this is going to be me once i finally get my zx-6r certified c: can't wait for spring. Just upgraded this year from the 250r 




 how did you find the final product? Did it make your legs spread further apart by doing it? 




 got the yarn at micheals (craft store) i cant remember what type it was as i dont have the package anymore 




 6oz/170g/315 yards 100% acrylic medium c: 




 yep im a vet tech. Snake came in very flat and we wanted to see if there was maybe an obstruction or something causing the listlessness, turned out to be viral 




 Me too, then id have a fleet c: 









 I'll have to get back to you on the exact yarn I need to find the label that was on it  
























 I want....  




 Can i buy one?

 Personally i liked twilight princess a lot better. Skyward sword was just bleh. I was super disappointed by the game overall. I think it was annoying having to buy everything and constantly fly around back to the main city. I just came out of the game not liking it at all. All the other ones ive played a million times, that one i probably wont even finish. What I really just don't like is the motion controls. I feel like i'm flailing around. I don't have a wii u yet, but I was hoping that they would mostly do away with that, or at least make an optional control to no have to swing remotes around. 




 I didn't like the clutch on the new bike. I didn't like the riding position.  Just my opinion. It didn't feel faster,  it felt sloppy.  




 Tbh i have ridden both ninja 250 and ninja 300 and i far prefer the 250. It was an excellent starter before i moved on to the 600  




 Yeah i agree. Unfamiliar bikes make it worse. And it would be nice to have more then jeans. Which spurred me to buy some riding pants today.  




 Yeah i wouldn't bother again.  Not without a few one an one with good instruction. The group was mostly people who have been on track before. It was intimidating. All i went for was to demo some new bikes  




 Yeah. Hence i didnt call it a track day. Just first experience with a bike on the track. Not sure if go again. Not without proper instruction and my own bike.  




 It was a Kawasaki demo ride you could ride any bike there on the track with a large group.  I'm in canada not the US  




 Ugh i dont know if i feel like i wouldn't want to again. I was so afraid. I feel embarrassed.  




 Wonder who won  




 They had 2 to heavy for me... I'm like a 5'3 female and that bike was just too much bike  




 Just the track to be honest. The bikes were fine. It was super twisty... Not used to that and i felt nervous of the eyes on me and other riders  




 Went out on a ZX10R and then a 300r and both times i was just way too uncomfortable. I felt so nervous. Both times. Just destroyed my confidence. I got back on mine to ride home and felt awful on it. Like my confidence is just shattered.  
























 I used a small bit of wood under each corner to prop it off the floor and to keep the carpet from getting hot.  Cheap easy lol.  




 Exactly. c: 









 The xrays do :/ 




 That's sorta a huge breach of client  confidentiality isn't it? Unless they said you could post this  




 ;)  you would  




 Not my bike no idea lol nothing i bet haha  




 Thank you! That one is mine c: 




 Nice i have the same year/bike in green c: 









 Yeah i went last year to and was in some serious race boots hiking is hard in thoes haha  




 Yeah i dont know many other women riders either is a shame really  




 Nova?  Its in Ontario Canada  









 The way the horse has its head makes the horse look fake to me. Like its a big stuffed dead thing she's posing on for fun. Even if it is real? It seems very fake.  




 Loved this game the most too. Wish they would do a 3DS remake or something
