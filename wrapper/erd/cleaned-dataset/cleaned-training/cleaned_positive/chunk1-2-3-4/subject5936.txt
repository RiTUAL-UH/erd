 The realisation that I liked not only men but also women and then also non-binary people came very slowly. I had feelings for girls at 16 and came out to myself at 18 (as bi). And when little sheltered me discover that gender is more complicated than than, I realised I could be attracted to non-binary people too. It's totally 'normal' (whatever that means) to always know or for it to come to you slowly. It's okay not to know yourself right away. You have to live to know yourself and at 21, I still don't feel like I know me and I don't feel like I fit the bisexuality label anymore. Hope this helps. 
























 Do tattoos blur or fade or disintegrate with time? Are there any tattooing misconceptions that you would like to clear up? 
























 First of all, Sir Ian, thank you for being a great British actor and LGBTQ activist - you make me proud to be British.
Is there anything about your career that you want to change/a new direction you want to go in? Have you regretted roles you've done? And what's your favourite wizard joke?
Thank you very much for taking the time in indulge our curiosities. :D 
























 A woman is someone who tells me that they are a woman. You don't 'need' a qualification to be a woman e.g. genitalia, clothes, make-up, long hair. It doesn't matter if your trans, genderfliud, cis or what. You don't need a certain trait to 'qualify' you as a woman.
Gender is just an easy way for cis-people to show their sex and hence their secondary characteristics. Presenting as one sex or another, I think, is supposed to indicate what genitalia you have but it's a flawed system. Because now we know, the traits one associates with gender don't necessarily equate to sex.

In summary: it doesn't matter what society thinks because society is a mish-mash of the thoughts and ideas of people that lived a long time ago, who don't know the things we do now and have the same experiences.
If you want to be called a woman, I will call you 'she' and treat you like anyone else. You are the only person who will live with you for your entire life and you know yourself best. Frankly, I think transpeople are some of the most amazing individuals around. GET 'EM GIRL!!!
