 A lot of the time I have trouble communicating why I feel so unhappy because there is no one core reason. I hate it when people say "You're not making any sense." after they ask me repeatedly to explain how I feel even after I tell them "I don't know" ... 
























 I try to count back from 10 but it's still really hard... what do you do to calm down? I get really angry like a spike of emotion, then I get angry and sad at myself for being so petty 
























 I barely stop myself, but whenever something annoys me I think of the most hurtful comment that I could possibly say to them, and for that split second I feel that I am completely justified to say that. But even when someone is saying nothing I feel like they are silently judging me somehow. I know it's crazy but nothing helps me from thinking that the world is against me or something (not meant to sound as melodramatic but I can't think of a better way to explain)
