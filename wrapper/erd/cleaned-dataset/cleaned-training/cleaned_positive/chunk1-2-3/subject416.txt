 Its really weird, a year ago I couldn't even have imagined ever being this happy again. Even if I thought things were better, I still felt really bad and just assumed this is what "normal" is like. It feels really strange sometimes now. 
























 I wish you all the best - keep trying and don't be afraid to change things in your life if you feel you need too. 
























 Something I do which has really helped me was to write down three things I was happy with every day - at first it was only small things, that I took a shower or that I made a proper meal ... Then, when I felt really horible, couldn't sleep I looked at the list and tried to think about the stuff I had written down and not the misstakes I made.
