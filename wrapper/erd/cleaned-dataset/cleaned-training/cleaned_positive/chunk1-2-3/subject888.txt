 interesting! good to know (more incentive to stick to beans, rice, and salads...the good ol' unprocessed staples of my diet). 




 tea—or more specifically the caffeine in tea—is indeed a diuretic. despite that, though, i really don’t know what to make of your case. really quite bizarre!

edit: grammar 




 Thank you for the reply.

I have mainly been reaching out via company websites' "Contact Us" forms, and have received a few lukewarm—but thoughtful—responses. 




 Hello,

I need some help. I am only 20, but so far college has been quite rough for me and I believe working with tea is my true calling. Upon discovering several small, ethical tea companies around the country (America), I have begun reaching out but so far have not been too lucky.

My passion is clear, I think, as is my willingness to work. Am I doing something wrong? Are these companies looking for something specific that I am lacking or perhaps failing to mention? Is there just not a great labor demand among these smaller companies?

Please respond with any relevant or potentially helpful information; particularly if you work for/have worked in the tea industry. This is my dream and, as I said previously, my true calling in life. Thank you. 




 I personally recommend ZeroWater! It is the only five-stage water filter on the market that removes 99.9% of dissolved solids in water. They are available on Amazon in differently-sized pitchers and dispensers, and from my personal experience, are ideal for tea (and general water drinking). :-) 




 Just out of curiosity, why are you against the recreational use of marijuana? Not trying to incite a war or anything. It's just not an opinion one hears a lot these days. 




 Thanks! 




 If you're in the mood for something a bit different (smokier) than your standard Earl G., Harney amp;amp;amp;amp; Sons' Earl of Harlem is supposed to be pretty excellent.

I've been meaning to pick some up myself, because their teas are pretty damn awesome:

Also—and I am speaking from experience here—Rishi Tea's Earl Grey Lavender is absolutely delicious (and pretty luxurious, particularly with some cream and honey):

For something a bit less pricey and in bags (although the flavor profile may not be as "interesting"), here is Rishi's plain Earl Grey in sachets:

 Does anyone know of a place to get a good tea needle and knife? I tried Amazon, and perhaps I was just not patient enough, but everything seemed pretty questionable and/or overpriced. 




 Yes! I live in Western North Carolina (where Panther Moon is based) and was able to try a few of their puerh teas at a tea festival in Black Mountain.

Everything about their tea 'friendship caravan' was wonderful; although they were very busy I received a thorough explanation on each tea I tried, all of which were delicious.

I ended up taking two ounces of a 2009 Zhang Lang sheng/raw puerh home, which was nice because I have been too lazy/forgetful to invest in a tea needle and knife. The tea is of superb quality—very fresh and light for a puerh—although if you want something with more age or in a different family of tea altogether, I can personally vouch for the value and quality of Panther Moon Tea Co. 




 They don't have to be books about dealing with grief or mental illness, nor do they need to have 'saved your life.' Just try and recall any book that has helped you break a depressive cycle or gain some new, maybe reinvigorating perspective.

Please avoid religious texts if you can. 
























 **"Platform" lyrics:**

**verse one**

Neon lights on the dust on the ground on the bus

Dirty roads makes that scarf wrap a must

Rolling by scrolling for the future on the app

Data mine my mind like a diamond in the ruff

**chorus**

Platforms here's a train of thought

Getting to the bright side of me is why I fought

I'm gonna say what else have I got

Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not.

**verse two**

If oil is the god then the cranes all pray

The crude is so rude

It makes the people pay

On the side of the road men make money

A flower for a dollar man

He wants a family

If I rose to power

It'll be a bouquet

Emoji a smiley

And say I'm OK

The tech dudes are the only ones having a good day

And talking is cheap

Coz they make it easy. 









 Thank you for the useful info and for your constructive comment. 




 First of all, please make a change in your diet.  Eat more unprocessed, actual foods... i.e. fresh fruits and vegetables.  I like to drink a strong roasted dandelion root tea to soften stools and to cleanse the liver.  Also you can try ginger to aid digestion; I do not, however, know of any laxative or stool-softening effects in ginger. 




 okay, fair point. my family maintains a small organic farm, and yes, we do use pesticides. but they are formulated to be safer than those normally used. 

so my wording was a bit off. teavana teas have been shown to contain dangerous levels of pesticides, and i have actually felt a nauseating, toxic sensation upon consuming some of their teas. now i find it practical and even necessary to be discerning, but i realize there are many people who have desirable experiences with tea regardless of the product’s ‘organic’ status. 




 alright r/tea, question time.

what are your thoughts on organically-grown and processed teas? are they frivolous luxury, absolute necessity, or complete nonsense altogether?

personally, i tend to go for the organic stuff; this habit arose after having several not-so-pleasant experiences with (teavana) teas grown using pesticides.

sometimes, though, i feel as if i’m missing out on some great tea experiences because of strict standards and a reluctance to deviate from any product that lacks organic certification.

what are your thoughts? 




 also, if you don’t mind me asking, where does one purchase a ‘top-shelf’ fukamushi? 




 let me know what you think! 




 :) a few months back i purchased a pound of organic fukamushi from Den's Tea, and i tend to agree with this assessment. my only question is... how does the extra steaming affect the leaf's health benefits? obviously the leaf becomes more particulate with the fukamushi process, but does that indicate any damage to the leaf's nutritional integrity? 




 i personally prefer fukamushi for its grassy overtones and particular cloudiness. just curious what others prefer between these differently-steamed Japanese greens and why. 




 hello,
i am going to be posting a simple preference-based question every few days just to help myself and others flesh out a greater understanding of the subtle-*teas* inherent to the world and culture of *camellia sinensis*.

so, for round one, the questions arises from the japanese tea tradition.  do you personally prefer the delicate freshness of a traditionally-steamed sencha or the heavier, more robust cloudiness of a more thoroughly-steamed fukamushi-sencha?  why? 
























 same.. 




 I honestly kind of like them...very minimalistic.  But the new Aero blur would be beautiful as well. 




 I'm on a Surface as well ;) 




 ..my-my eyes.... 









 It's still Windows 10, either way.  I just thought the Defender app and my desktop wallpaper went especially well together. :) 




 I think that design choice may be up to the app (in this case Spotify) developers, not Microsoft. 




 seems she took it down - same fate as the last teaser, CanSeeCanDo.
here are links for both.
