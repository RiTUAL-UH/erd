 nice :D 




 Pekovic isn't a great defensive player either. 









 U got Kik? 




 At the end of the day Salmons, Stiemsma, heck even Kwame Brown and Smush Parker all of them  Andrea Bargnani. 




 And what if Bennett plays to full potential, you could have Brewer, Martin, Thad-Young, and maybe trade Pekovic and Barea for a good backup Center or PG. 




 Unfortunately, The Knicks and Kings have a much better chance of getting Rondo, if we trade anyone, we're done. Let's see how Hibbert and West lead the team this year. Maybe Stuckey can put up big numbers, his stats when he got starter minutes were just slightly worse than D-Wade this season. Let's hope Solomon Hill is a decent player. Lastly, let's hope Solomon Hill doesn't become the most improved player and Larry Bird does something stupid like trade PG, like they did with Granger, and let's hope they don't trade Hibbert for Monroe, cuz Monroe is only gonna demand a huge contract or leave in free agency. 




 Don't get too fancy, I would recommend at most, a free throw line finger roll, to look like you're gliding. Jump from as far as you can. 




 I love Singleton, but I feel like Dahntay Jones, Jordan Crawford, or Ronnie Brewer would've been better. 









 idk if firstrowsports.eu has fiba, but u can try 




 Another thing i forgot to add, is
If i make another Cavaliers Mix in the future.

What would like to see?
1. LeBron 
2. Love 
3. Irving
4. All 3?
5. Waiters
6. Other (comment suggestion)

 thanks for your sympathy...
...but i thought Joel Embiid was coming back later this season?? 




 :) i made it, glad u enjoyed it, im a pacers fan, but i cant wait to see what he can do.  




 we should waive Rasual Butler or Donald Sloan 

i really want to see some better players :( 




 I'm thinking since we didn't get Shawn Marion (the next juwan howard, riding the bench for rings)

Maybe Dahntay Jones, Ronnie Brewer??

or should we go for more offense? 









 but people could troll youtubers who upload things to their second channels. 




 it looks like this for me http://prntscr.com/4hld2c 









 I'm really late, but I'm really nice:

Enjoy(even tho it's a fake pic):http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9kPCkTpAsOE/UcBS6cwWMBI/AAAAAAAAAKU/lB9OfpMu-C4/s1600/191746700_Selena_Gomez_The_Big_OMG_fini_Swimtrun_123_357lo.jpg 














 Hi, I don't know if people are still looking at this. But....without further ado..

My name is Tim, I posted gaming videos, sometimes Chatroulette trolling, and occasionally a tutorial. 

I do have a capture card for PS3 gaming, but I need to buy HDMI Cables and PS3 HD/AV Component cables

I'm only 15, and I've had a YouTube account since I was 9 lol, but this channel isn't the one from 2007, I made this to start a new chapter in life.

I struggle with depression and anxiety like many teens but I'm also very socially awkward so YouTube is my way to escape from reality, somewhat.

I don't really like posting just gameplay, I like to discuss thing, I'm just not a vLog person so, I commentate over gameplay.

I hope you enjoy my content and subscribe.
Remember it's not an obligation, only subscribe if you like it.

 Lol Nintendo is like Nokia...#unbreakable 




 Have you ever thought of embracing the fact that you made a mistake. For instance, I once did something on instagram that made me look gay in front of most of my friends, but I eventually embraced it, if I accidentally did something "homo" I'd just say "oh well I guess I'm gay" and people would laugh. Soon everyone forgot.  
























 im assuming

 (Disclaimer: I'm black.)

My Alien Pet ::
Name :: Jerome (pronounced Jay-Roh-May)

My pet is the Realest nigga alive, and non-humans ain't even considered niggas, but that's what makes Jerome unique.
You see in 1993, Jerome landed on a planet called Kintekai, it was the land of Fried Chicken! Jerome lived there for 21 years. On November 4th 2014, Jerome appeared in my room, he was tall, muscular, looked like a human, and had real nigga traits, he had a high top fade, 8 pack natural abs, and he would sweat grape drink, not grape juice, grape drink. Anyways, Jerome didn't introduce himself to me like a normal alien (e.g. "I come in peace."), instead he(at least I'm assuming it a he, due to his name and appearance), introduced himself like this: "Yo Dawg, is you Timothy?" To which I responded..."Yes, but my parents are asleep please keep it down", he then proceeded to say: "Nah, nigga, don't worry b, only you can hear me, infact, you can respond to me, using your thots, I mean thoughts, I was sent from the planet Kintekai, to be your pet, but I don't play dat homo sh** mayne, no offensive to gays, but by pet, I don't mean no intimate stuff, iight my nigga?"...I said "lol...alright"(yes I actually said 'LOL') then we played some 2k, and then I checked reddit and saw this...so yeah. 




 In elementary school (kindergarten to grade6)
kids would sing [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoVPzYbGFQw) 














 Oh alright, thanks. 









 Well maybe a SG/SF, that can play SF this year then move to SG when PG13 is back. 














 Lance was amazing, i do miss him, atleast he's the same old Lance we all love :D http://i.imgur.com/rQgd6wg.gif 




 9+10= ~~21~~ 19 




 what is this thing im seeing in some people's posts(on /r/FreeKarma) about reading capchas or however you spell it? 




 trade Scola for a decent SF maybe? 




 I love that we still cover news on Lance, He's a Pacer for Life!! #PacersNation hopefully he comes back after his contract is up. 



















 I remember commented on a Lakers post about Julius Randle.
As a Pacers fan, I understand what it feels to have multiple players injured (george, west, hill, watson). 
But if you saw how Roy Hibbert played (22pts 8reb 7blk), i can guarantee you, someone will step up, whether it be Ibaka, or like you said Perry Jones, someone will. I'm sorry for your lost, and  I don't really understand how bad it might feel, playing in a strong West Conf.
But nevertheless, I wish you guys the best on your season. 




 I'm a Pacers fan, and I understand how you guys feel **completely**
Just like how Paul George has MVP potential.
I believe Julius Randle has the potential to not only be a perennial all star, but the face of the Lakers franchise down the road.
Competitiveness aside, I wish you guys the best on your season. :) 









 isnt Hill, West, George, Mahinmi, Stuckey, and Watson injured
and like Rudez cant shoot, and SoloHill isnt really scoring?

Hibbert's doing well, some games are weak on the boards, but he's looking good. 




 yea, Lance only hates Evan Turner.
 




 George Hill
Knee Contusion 




 I'd be satisfied if Hibbert just completely forgot about offense, and put up Ben Wallace numbers:

2005-06 B.Wallace: 7.3ppg 11.3rpg 2.2bpg
(Roy might average more blocks though.) 









 i still say its worth it, im just pissed off with that fact that i cant use VC on MyCAREER cuz it doesnt connect to 2K Sports server, so idk if i can play crews or myplayer blacktop anymore.

it doesnt say i cant play it, it just says offline MyCAREER means using Skill points instead of VC..

i hope i can still play blacktop online or crews if i ever find people to make one 




 its okay, i mean, its worth it, if the server work for you.  




 update just lost 80-54
KD had 40 pts 18-18fg
 




 (i own a ps3 copy of the game)

only graphic changes are Nick Young's hair, Anthony Davis and Jimmy Butler have mini afros, and Chandler Parsons looks real for once, they still haven't given Steve Nash the hair he's had for so long now, since he joined LA (2k13).

and the 2k sports servers are retarded.
every time it autosaves its supposedly "retrieving your files from the 2k Sports Server" for like 50 seconds

and when i create a MyCAREER, it says im unable to connect to the 2k Sports Server so i either play offline MyCAREER or get sent back to the main screen with KD on it. 

Then when i go to load the MyCAREER, instead of letting me go to edit my player/play game/look at my player, it sends me back to play the **Rookie Showcase**

When looking for a match online the game stays at 
**HEAD-TO-HEAD**
**Searching for matches...**
until you cancel it.

2K Heroes mode also doesnt work because...you cant match up with anyone to play online.

MyTEAM is undergoing maintenance.
Wait...hold on, im trying right now
it'll be a while since its **RETRIEVING DATA OF WHATEVER FOR 3 HOURS**

*takes chill pill*

alright, im making a team, since i cant make a MyCAREER....actually maybe i'll check out MyCAREER and see if it works, now that MyTEAM works.
i named myTEAM the Toronto Lynxes...cuz apparently the "Lynx" is native to toronto, or something like that.

My starting lineup is Canaan, Rivers, Joe Harris, Jeremy Evans, and Sims

OH look i can play someone .__.
so whats wrong wi- **HOLY SILVER PLAYERS**, Kevin Durant. omg, k well, im about to lose cya :D 




 No, by "Final Chapter" i mean, the last few years, his last run at success in the NBA, and stuff like that. 







































 lmao wow. 









 im not from indiana, im from toronto, but im a huge pacers fan.
I wouldnt boo him at all if i was there, i love Lance. 









 And Screw The Wizards Fan talking trash to PG last year. 









 IT JUST CAME OUT LIKE HALF AN HOUR AGO FROM THIS POST. :')

#Based 









 Great, now that new change to rule 1.


Now my dreams are gone.

Shouldve read first.

This is why my life sucks. Welp might as well delete my post. 

I'm just going to have to get fake followers and hope for recognition, my dreams are ruined, and the sad thing is, now i'm coming off as more of a attention seeker, and now people definitely won't care, but then again, I don't know how this subreddit treats people with dreams like me, idk if they're trolls or caring. 









 :'( I wish i was a famous as you :'(
