 I'm pretty new to knitting this scarf and the other Gryffindor one I made are my first creations hah...  I believe I used a 16" round needle for the entire scarf. Used a crochet hook to place the tassels. As for the yarn I just picked two colours I liked of the same thickness. I used different thickness for the Gryffindor one than the slytherin same needles though I prefer my scarves to be knitted in the round that way they are double thick with no ugly side c: I can provide the knitting pattern if anyone is interested.  




 Snake needed an xray c:

 They do it usually to help shed, mine however goes in there to soak and then she poops lol

 We used a bolt cutter to remove it

 I recommend removing all substrate and replacing with paper towel till mites are gone, give all the hides a good wash in scalding water. As for the spray I'd has an ivomec spray and give the snake an ivomec injection if you can it works the best and is easily available at local vet clinics    




 She's a salmon boa and her and her name is Nymeria. This is the first time I've seen her soaking on her own c. 









 I work at a zoo as a veterinary technician and I also do animal husbandry ect. All the animals at my zoo receive a very high level of care. There's very careful guidelines that have to be followed to remain a member of caza! We clean daily, sometimes more then once, feed multiple times and different ways and provide extra enrichment daily as well all the animals I work with daily are very happy and well cared for. Medical issues are dealt with by the veterinarian right away. I can't speak for all zoos but the one I work at is great.  





























 Scared the shit out of me.. Not the bike.  The track, being on one. So nervous i didnt enjoy it. Any advice? 
 









 The 250 i had before was great height. For reference im 5'3.  The 600 is a bit tall for me.  




 Helps when you link me to it ;)  




 I'm the girlfriend and mine is the green one c:

 I didn't enjoy skyward sword at all. In fact I didn't like it so much I never bothered to finish it.  The controls for swimming I thing irritated me the most about it. And all the other bs that came with it. One of my favourites is MM. I can say I've beaten it more then any other one.  But anyway the point is I think I actually hated skyward sword. Wii controls in general I find too flailey and I find myself disliking the entire motion control system. Just my two cents.   




 Horses should be moved down :P
