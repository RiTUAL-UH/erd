 The realisation that I liked not only men but also women and then also non-binary people came very slowly. I had feelings for girls at 16 and came out to myself at 18 (as bi). And when little sheltered me discover that gender is more complicated than than, I realised I could be attracted to non-binary people too. It's totally 'normal' (whatever that means) to always know or for it to come to you slowly. It's okay not to know yourself right away. You have to live to know yourself and at 21, I still don't feel like I know me and I don't feel like I fit the bisexuality label anymore. Hope this helps. 
























 Do tattoos blur or fade or disintegrate with time? Are there any tattooing misconceptions that you would like to clear up?
