 I've been SH free for a little while now, but the urges are getting too strong and too frequent. I don't think I can resist it for much longer.

Edit: I gave in to the urges. Sorry. I appreciate those who replied and tried to help and I'll try harder to resist in the future :(  




 That's awesome! It may not feel like it, but it's the little things that count :)  




 I've always done this, without even really thinking about it or realising.  




 I have a Z2, I'm the exact same! 









 thanks :)  




 Thank you, it's nice to hear that from someone :) 




 Thanks :3  




 Just wanted to say it. I don't have anyone else to really talk to. But yeah, 50 days self harm free. 




 Quackers 




 I've been prescribed them for depression/self harming, and social anxiety. 




 Yeah, I've been feeling that way too but somehow I've always gone back to it. Thanks for the reply too :)  




 Thanks for the reply :) I'll try doing more positive activities when I feel that way :) 




 I do. Practically every night I sleep in this position, I find it strangely comfortable. 
























 Good luck :) x 




 Haha, I do agree ._.  









 I'm in the same position. Perhaps speak to your doctor about changing medication?  




 I see, thank you. I checked online and this is definitely it. Still terrified though, working up some courage to get it outside 




 I'm so glad it could help. 




 I live in Scotland?  









 I think it's something a lot of people need to hear   




 You're welcome. Pm me if you ever need to talk :) 









 I actually saw the doll straight away, definitely creepy. Awesome collection though!  




 Well done on the 6 days :) don't let it get you down too much, just pick up and try again. As for the person you promised, I'm sure they'll understand.  




 The last one with the little girl...  "soon"
