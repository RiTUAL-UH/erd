 You are missing the point. We don't know the full story about why the kid was taken away, but we know the result of it. That's where the hammer should be falling at this point.

---

I was going to post links on CPS-related support groups and survivors of abusive foster care, but all I've found is some facebook group with crucifixes all over, and I can't in good conscience link to that. I don't believe that people who have been abused should be given more false hope in something that's being proven to be just another mechanism of control over the vulnerable by the malevolent.

Sorry, I know this isn't the time or place for that. The combination of these subjects is a little overwhelming, and something should be said about those emotions because these things are so wrongfully and heavily intertwined in our culture.

If something like this has affected your life, you are not alone, and a source of comfort would be to do something towards making sure this kind of thing doesn't happen to someone else. If anyone has better links or real world knowledge about changing this sort of thing please share. 




 Regardless of the reason why she was taken out of custody, those involved in making the decision to hand this child over to a maniac should be held liable, much in the same way the public is held liable in some circumstances if people get killed by cops while chasing them down the road or in a shootout. 




 DUI's are big business, just like locking up potheads is big business. Good luck getting any real support for anything that doesn't put money into political pockets. 




 I was deap sea fishing tied to a rig once during rough seas and went overboard in water full of sharks. I made it back to land - to the boat rather.

Thanks for the memory of that and all the other times I've almost drowned.

Sorry to hear about your experience though. 




 Got lost in the wildnerness of Alaska for about 4 days. Ran across a big bear who I managed to sneak away from and got chased by a big moose through the woods.

Fell on some slippery rock above Sitting Bull Falls when I was a teenager, just a few feet from the cliff. Had to lay flat on my stomach as people linked hands to bring me back.

Got an AK47 pointed in my face in downtown Matamoros by a coked up cop demanding my wallet. He got the wallet, I got to live.

Got chased out of Reynosa by a gang of thugs, came within seconds of getting beaten to death as the cabby demanded my belongings. All I had was a watch and a little cash.

Been attacked by gangs Austin, had my truck torn to pieces by a bunch of fucked up thugs. Managed to drive away from that one but in the back of a cop car. They weren't caught.

Got stabbed in the hip by a thug in New Mexico. Pulled the blade out with a bleeding hand. Choked him out with a dislocated shoulder and rolled him into a cactus.

Had to choke out a big stray dog once. Was getting choked by a big guy in a bar once, almost passed out before I thought to box his ears.

Chased home almost every day from school in El Paso. Beaten half to death several times, on several occasions cars stopping to help me.

Held at knife point for my wallet in El Paso during school lunch by drop outs.

Got chased in a vehicle by some meth heads with guns until I pointed a bigger gun back at them while sitting on the car door. They were talking vulgar shit to some girl in a convenience store and I told them to watch their mouths. When we pulled out of the store they followed us, got beside us flashing the gun, and generally asked for it.

Overdosed on alcolhol several times as a teenager, barely OD'd on hard drugs once but pulled through before having to go to ER.

Got stung over 300 times by hornets at once. Was bitten by a rattlesnake but it luckily did not inject venom. Apparently they don't sometimes.

Got pulled over by an intensely crooked cop in the middle of nowhwere outside of Corpus Christi. Having been in bad situations before I could tell this guy wanted all my shit and just to get rid of me. Wound getting let go because he got a real call.

Had a price on my head by an unmentionable group of people for fucking up their operation many years ago. Came close to someone collecting that price and fucked them up only to find out later that night from a friend of a friend that's what was happening.

Almost knocked off a bridge on I-90 by a semi outside of Del Rio. Was intentionally ran off the road. T-boned by an old tourist who ran a stop sign into a busy, divided street. Wound up with back problems for life but never got money out of it.

Fell from a ladder on the job because of faulty maintenance on the hard line I was hooked to. The eye-hook at one end of the line snapped and I dropped about 23 feet wearing 25 pounds of sharp tools. Broke my elbow and tibia and dislocated my shoulder and jaw. Never got money from any of this, come to think of it. Never wanted to ask though, just glad to be alive.

When my mother was pregnant with me one of her students attacked her and kicked her in the stomach repeatedly, yelling "I'm going to kill your baby!" over and over. Her own immune system tried to kill me and almost succeeded. Doctors told her when she was 3 months pregnant that I'd never live.

Had a gun pointed at me in Houston by a man who thought I was stealing stuff. I was just lost in a bad part of town (I have no reason to steal shit.. I make money and have a sense of dignity, believe it or not).

Not sure how many times I've avoided death by playing it cool in other bad situations. I could list more but they'd have to be too specific. I'm paranoid enough, and rightly so.

Trying to think of more general instances. Doctor doesn't think I have PTSD. Maybe this will help me build my case for him. Reading back over this.. man.. every day I stay in bed is a good day for me.
 




 Not sure what to think of that. When I was a middle school student in El Paso, Texas, we all took exams to place us ahead into algebra in the 8th grade.

I nearly aced the test, but because I was white I was not approved - because they had to allow a certain percentage of "minority" students into the class, even though only 1 in 10 students in that school were "white".

I've never felt the same about public education. That single experience pissed me off so much that I refused anything to do with education in this country in general, despite my own mother being a long time teacher of special needs children.

I'm a high school drop out with no college, and I make six figures today. Even though I live in Austin, my child will never have to know what I went through because I am working my ass off to pay for a real education for him from the start.

Fuck everything about this.
 




 Well how about that? Good ol' Texas Monthly with first hand accounts of how innefective the war on drugs is, from the perspective of an editor and pot-smoker no less. 

Arguably the best magazine you cay buy at HEB.

I would counter one point, if only from a different perspective.

Border patrol and customs agents aren't a humorless bunch when you get to know them. Their job is very serious, and watching them work is, for the most part, a feeling of tax dollars being spent on a professional who is out to do the right thing.

It should be comforting to know that they are not there to plant drugs on you, trump up charges, or otherwise attempt to take you for all you are worth - like the HPD or Travis Country Sherriff's office. The men and women of CBP and ICE have a no-nonsense approach to law enforcement that is something every LEO in the state would do well to admire, and the things they put up with on the job, and I'm not talking about the dangers of protecting the public against the public, are symptoms of a beaurocratic cluster fuck like nothing less than a war on drugs could produce.

I've been through that check point a few times. In fact, I used to work cattle and oil fields not far from there. One thing that I didn't see mentioned in this article was much about that country itself. It grows on you and when it does, especially if you grew up there, you feel a natural urge to defend that pristine, arid expanse. Areas like that are known for the pride the people have. That pride stems from hard ways of life and the existential victories that go with it. You can see this in the eyes of law enforcement in that region, at least those that grew up right.

--

Fixing my typos and grammar since it's in response to such a well written article. 




 That's not very comforting. 




 "Anyone know what's been wrong with Bob lately? He's been acting weird again."

"Ah, probably just another Carrington Event he isn't telling us about."

"Yeah, you are probably right. Good thing it's not because the Cubs lost again, remember that episode?"

"Hah! Yeah, he sent email to the *whole* *department* that time." 




 Thanks, this made me laugh. Have a single upvote. 




 I think you are largely correct, but you hold a common misunderstanding about the availability of jobs requiring Linux experience. There are plenty of them out there, you just have to know more than an OS or two to get them. If you happen to know even more, you are going to get paid accordingly. In metropolitan areas there is no shortage of entry level work at places like hosting outfits. In those environments you are typically encouraged to take flight and learn as much as you want about IT. Linux is just a stepping stone, another term on your resume next to a  whole bunch of other acronyms. 




 This IS a warning. 




 And no documentation. 




 I don't know about that. Nuclear war, even as screwed up as the world is, has far too much money behind preventing it. Greedy assholes know they can't take it with them and are likely content with spending it on this planet as long as possible.

The asteroid is scary enough, but the effects of an impact might not be much different than runaway climate change depending on how big the impactor was, and we are only getting more certain that severe weather is going to be the new norm. 




 Maybe in Psychiatric studies. 




 From the bench to the trench, there is no honor in what these people do. 




 TIL Big Oil's profits are inversely proportional to the strength of the American dollar.

That's fucking scary. If these people need the American dollar to sink in order to raise profit margins, I'm pretty sure they'll do what it takes to keep the dollar fucked. 




 I'm with you on that. "Alarmist" is mischaracterization.

Here we are, faced with a situation that we know could be disastrous within our lifetimes, but since we are't "exactly sure" of the date or the trigger, we'll just marginalize the research, forget about it all, and go back to watching TV.

Great plan, isn't it? We are a doomed species headed for a terrible extinction. It isn't a matter of what or when, it's a matter of how we spend the time we have left with each other.

Consider yourself hugged.

In fact, I think I will go over to r/christianity and pass out a few hugs. Life is too short to fault idiots for being the cause of our extinction any longer. 




 Many people here just feel that making women wear burkas is barbaric, and putting forth a cartoon justifying that in any way is counter productive in terms of basic human rights. I'm sure it will always be an option in the Middle East, but to western cultures the notion is just misogynistic and otherwise baseless.

Take GI Joe for example. However entertaining and inspiring it was for kids, it is still widely held as propaganda used to desensitize human nature and plant that early seed to get kids to enlist in the war machine.

Dunno man. Personally, I hate the idea of burkas or anything else representative of institutionalized control over a populace that is missing out on real progress. It has nothing to do with religion to me, nothing to do with race, but everything to do with exerting control over others. 




 If you're an adult with a respectable income, and no defaults, banks will not deny you a loan.

That's up for debate, and every bit of credit counts. If you are ambitous and attempting to make a million from scratch, you'll need every penny of credit you can get. Playing that game the right way and having a firm grasp of how our financial system works from top to bottom can only help. There is no reason not to go for as much as you can in life. 




 Peekaboo! 




 And make a list to stick to. 




 If anyone is wondering what Blue Rhino makes, you've probably seen the propane tanks in cages in front of Home Depot.

That's what the "thousands" of explosions are. 




 Scary isn't it? People willing to give up that law in order to feel safe - from the police no less.

Can't martial law be declared there in order to get the military deployed? I'm not advocating this, but isn't that possible? 




 I don't want anyone asking *me* for more money, and that's what shopping at places paying a $10 an hour wage for unskilled labor will amount to.

If people are out there making $10 an hour, that's roughly what, $45000 a year for a couple? I find it difficult to imagine that $10 an hour is going to get my already useless neighborhood back to work. If anything, if they do get motivated by it to get a job, they'll stay in that job.

I guess that's better than them stealing my shit though. 




 Have an upvote, pops.

Much can be said about the 90's too. As teenagers we saw the explosive birth of the Internet, the revolutionary grunge/alternative/techno music scene (arguably the last wave of good music ever created), and later we saw the World Trade Center's fall. Between then and there, we had aunts and uncles in the Gulf War, friends fighting in Kosovo, and now many of us are gone, lost to a prison industrial complex or IEDs in the Middle East; violence at the hands of others. We are a generation of slaves to a new era in monetary control over human lives. Our liberating moment was the day YouTube came on line and people, especially kids, from around the world got to share the world as they knew it with each other.

And the only people who will ever understand anything about it are people like you. 




 I paid for mine. 




 If these people could make a fucking pizza worth eating I might cheer for them, but 99% of every piece of fast food that I have ordered has been a sloppy mess, a mockery of what's possible in those state of the art food prep areas.

Fuck that. I did my time in a Chinese restaurant and then a pizza joint. Tired of being treated like shit? GO TO SCHOOL AND MAJOR IN SOMETHING BESIDES MUSIC AND ART.

In six years this country would look completely different if they walked out that door and into a political science or engineering major.

The sad part is that fast food holds up so much of our economy that if that workforce were suddenly unemployed this country would burn up in a fit of riots. An uneducated, unemployed populace is out there with a huge sense of self-entitlement, and now they are growing less content with their lifestyle idolizing wealth and fame because they realize they'll never see it.

Stay in school. Try harder. Keep trying harder. That's all you can do in this life to guarantee yourself any degree of success and financial independence.

Life is not some giant video game where you get paid for being on Twitter and Facebook or World of Warcraft. Life is ultimately about survival and *nobody* owes you a *fucking* *thing*.

I know people who have overcome serious mental, physical, and psychological handicaps because they wanted something better for themselves. They looked inside and saw what so many people in this country fail to see: a living, breathing, feeling being. People are so used to being treated like bags of fat born into a rat race of slavery to a credit system and a stack of rules against them that they forget what it's like to want to be free of it all. 

That's a feeling children have, a naturally occurring instinct that is being burned out of our brains from day one. Don't forget that feeling because as soon as you do you have given up on life and you are no good to anyone but the man taking your money.

---

Look, not trying to piss anyone off. All I'm saying is that if you don't like what you are getting paid then you have to move on. If you can't move on immediately, make plans, read books, go to the MIT website and get a free education in robotics. Something, anything but go home, sit in front of the TV, and chat with people on your cell phone. 




 I don't understand how a culture can emigrate to another country and attempt to push their values on the entirety of that country in modern times.

Presumably the reason for emgiration would be to better one's lifestyle, and presumably that better lifestyle exists within a different country than one's own because the original country is not satisfactory.

This makes me wonder if the original country that brought about that culture has a critical flaw. If so, where is the justification for causing harm like this? If not, where is the justification for causing harm like this?

If I believe in, for example, the slaughtering of sheep and nailing them to my door to rot, but I am not happy with my home town where everyone does it, what gives me the right to go to another town, rot sheep at my doorstep, and then complain when people get upset about the smell? I'd have no choice but to rationalize that the slaughtering of said sheep was a product of a flawed culture, and therefore I'd believe that I probably shouldn't be doing so where it is outlawed for sanitary reasons.

Jesus.. 




 I'd like my children to set foot on another planet.

And the technology for them to stay there... 




 Not to detract from the obvious, but there are a whole lot of people out there who refuse to eat at fast food chains or shop at Walmart and Target because of how incredibly bad those businesses are for the local economies - especially in smaller cities.

The last time I went to Walmart was a very long time ago and was out of pure necessity. I needed a car battery and purchased one at the automotive counter. The woman behind the counter was ragged, balding, and tough looking. I thought about how this woman could probably own a small business herself, and it must have been the look on my face that started the conversation. She wound up telling me she was just grateful that she had that job.

It hurt a to see the lines in her face deepen with each word as she told me that.

But that is the way the world is going, and there is no stopping it. One day there will be only 1 "company", and it will be merged with government. Each citizen will have their productive place in society. Sprawling industrial complexes will line the planet's waterways, and our great-grandchildren will be the architects, engineers, and labor - cogs in an ever-growing machine designed to rid the planet of our presence through scarification of the terrain. 




 And the vast majority of Actually Successful people are taking themselves too seriously to see that the blame does not lie solely on the lazy, unorganized, and apathetic, but with the greedy, powerful, and malevolent. 




 Having spent much of my youth in South Texas I can attest to how crooked the police are.

You are absolutely right. You are just one traffic stop away from having your life ruined when living down there. I've been beaten, molested, falsely accused, and had my otherwise clean name and record ruined by these kinds of assholes.

Now I'm all grown up, making lots of money, have lots of old and new friends who have lots of different types of high paying jobs.

And we all fucking hate cops. Some of them are even cops, game wardens, government officials, border patrol, all of these kinds of authority figures, and the sentiment rings true with all of them.

This isn't some immature emotion without considering their job, blaming a few bad apples, or any bull shit like that. This is real world contempt for a group of people hell bent on obtaining power just so they can abuse it. That's the kind of trash that belongs in prison, and the only way to put them there is to take their jobs away from them by getting people into office that you can trust to do the right thing. 




 They're making it sound like their hands were tied to do anything else.

Accountability is found anywhere but within the public education system. The only people that suffer the consequences of such ineptitude are the students trying to learn from a warped curriculum and the teachers that really care about the fact that their students are having their chance at something better in life ripped away. 




 teach these slimy sob's we don't just hand out blank checks anymore...

This happened in the US. Not somewhere else. 




 I am proud of working 50+ hours a week because its the only way to support all this:

My health insurance used to cost about $300-500 a month for my modest family. Now it costs $1200 a month and every fucking time I go to the doctor and pay my $50 co-pay I get another bill in the mail a month later from that doctor for another $50. And then, when bad shit happens, I have to pay $200 up front to see someone about it, I get the runaround and have to go back ever 2 weeks at $50 a pop, with the $50 bill later, and I'm still miserable with something very easy to treat. I shouldn't be put on experimental drugs that cost a fortune, and I shouldn't have $1500+ a month in expenses to do it.

I wouldn't mind paying that much if doctors didn't treat me like they were selling me a used car. I can't go "out of network" for any more "opinions' because that costs 3x as much if its covered at all or if the damn doctor can even do business with my insurance company to begin with.

Healthcare in this country is a scam. These huge companies have had *decades* to rig this game behind closed doors with more connections and deeper pockets than most voters in my state can comprehend.

To top that off I have to pay out the nose for anything unrelated to the common cold. I could either have good teeth and eye glasses, or I can have non-processed food in my refrigerator and the electricity to run it. If I neglect my diet I will just wind up with more health problems, and if I let the lights go out I'd have no way to function in this society that requires my attention at 8 AM sharp 60 hours a week.

Transportation, gotta have that because public transit in Austin is a joke. There's a car payment and another insurance company screwing me. Gas, maintenance, stickers, comes out to what? $500 a month on a good month of telecommuting?

Electricity, gas, water, and Internet! Gotta have it to live and work. $300. Food $600!!!

Rent! Can't live in the ghetto! Got a family to protect! That's almost a grand with even more insurance and fees up my ass.

Cell phone! Gotta have coverage where I spend my time! Can't use shitty, cheap carriers, gotta use something reliable! $100 a month, just for me!

Pre-k isn't publicly available here? Costs $700 a month not to have your kids beaten and molested in some inner-city juvenile-detention center equivalent moldy basement?

Kids got a cold? Tonsils? Doctor, pharmacy, surgery, doctor, pharmacy, doctor... Ear infection! $150 for 1/2 shot glass full of ear drops! $4/drop?? 4 drops three times a day??? Hurts daddy! Sorry baby, so sorry. Please take your medicine. Make you feel better. Feel better? See! Good! Daddy loves you so. Pick you up from school today!

Lost the job! Oh no! Savings? What savings?? Ah, time to sell all my tools! What? Can't do that because you need them to build stuff you can sell! Build it! Sell it! What? Nobody needs your shit you build? Nobody can afford it? Walmart what?

My living expenses are increasing by 10% a year and have been for many years. I eat shit food, feed my family the best I can, get into arguments with the warden about leaving lights on and the doors open when its 110 degrees outside.

Seriously - let me tell you what a typical dinner for me is like:

1) Thaw some chicken. Find a recipe in r/food. Dig up spices, cook up an amazing dish or four. Not enough for everyone - you guys go ahead. Growing kids! Eat up! Good food! Dad eats the scraps while he does dishes.

2) BBQ ever few weeks - cook phenomenal burgers, maybe some cheap steaks with so much prep in them they taste like 5 star food - dad eats the hot dogs.

No smoking. No drinking. No fishing. Got an old acoustic guitar though - and a little garden full of essentially sterile fruit from Home Depot to keep me from going insane.

Gotta have that A/C cranked up or I can't sleep. Gotta have a fan blowing on me or I can't sleep. Bigtime insomniac. Brain too hot at 1:30 AM. Make ice pack. Fall asleep at 3 AM. Miss alarm again. Piss off the team at work again. Grumpy dad again. Sorry kiddo. Let's make legos. Fall asleep on legos at 7 PM. Wake up at midnight, can't sleep again.

Need to see Grandma. Grandma is sick. Drive drive drive all weekend. Pack sandwiches and fruit. Overdraw bank account on Sunday for gas home. Dead battery and dog puke in truck, middle of nowhere. Call roadside! Worth extra $10 on insurance each month! $125 deductible? Take hot checks?

Locked out house. Cell phone cut off. Where's momma? Daddy! You got tools in the truck! Drill out lock. Home Depot door knobs. Landlord pissed. Quit coming to my home please.

Find a job finally. Great pay! In six months get back on track with bills! Oh wait, hourly pay. Work too slow, waiting on everyone to give me material to consolidate. Project behind. Not enough work. Mug shot on internet. Can't get good job anyway.

Find part time job too! Two jobs dad! Great! Momma sick, can't work, needs disability, doesn't qualify, poor momma. Flowers. Drawings. Make momma feel better, lets all give her hugs. House so dirty. Lets clean house for momma everyone! Fun! Tired. Miss work. Can't find keys. Can't find phone. Left badge at home again. 

Speeding ticket. Bullshit lying lazy tax sponge welfare bully cops too stupid to do real work. Insurance higher up ass again. Ouch. More ramen.

Sell TV. Sorry babies. We have a little one. No, won't sell your Nintendo. No way. Sell guitar. House robbed.

Car wreck! Totaled the immortal Rav 4! 150,000 miles on the Rav 4. Totaled! Get $4000! Give to IRS!

Tired. Bad dream. No, food poisoning from fridge that keeps going out. Landlord won't replace. Fridge worthless, food thrown out. Everyone sick. Sorry. Buy little fridge. Sorry. Love you, here is strawberries little one. Eat salty chips. Thirsty. Taste chemicals in tap water.

Need coffee. Too much coffee. Can't sleep. Coffee after 3 PM, bad idea, doc. Can't fall asleep at work again. Momma take them to the park please. Mania. Hide. Cry. Feel better. Read Reddit. World still fucked. Wind up in weird corner of Youtube with Crank Yaners, Nibiru, and Alex Jones. 2 AM.

One more day. Sleep all weekend. Daddy's so tired. We can go tomorrow. 




 What's worse is how there is no end in sight, regardless of who gets "elected". 




 Who's "Justice" Department would be? This entire country's leadership is and has been engaged in a reckless trampling of civil rights for decades if not centuries. 




 I can't wait for this to arrive in The States so I can die for an hour, get rushed to ER, and get brought back into slavery with a $750,000 medical bill for being hooked up to a water pump and a pneumatic press, and a Linux box.

Sarcasm aside, this is truly astounding. I wish it were around years ago before my loved ones lit off. 




 I never believed that the world was such a horrible and cruel place until I saw it all on YouTube with my own eyes years ago. 




 When I was skipping school in the 90's, I spent time on the Internet witnessing the explosive awareness and realization that our country is and has been all of those things, we just never had a way of telling each other about it.  




 Or just eliminate journalism all together. 




 Let's start with upholding the laws we already have - like that whole constitution thing that should have prevented this in the first place. If we get that far we'll have gone leaps and bounds beyond where we are at now. 




 Personally, I downvote puns because they add no substance to the discussion whatsoever.

But then, usually neither do my rants - but at least my rants serve to show others that if they feel the same way that they are not alone. I'm pretty sure everyone on the planet with a mouth and/or one finger/ear/eyeball can come up with at least one pun. It takes a little research to come up with a well rounded rant that inspires people to talk back or shut up and change something.

And if you are here for instant gratification period, then you really aren't adding a damned thing to anyone's (except for fellow karma whores) outlook on life. That might be something you need because you don't get enough of it in real life, or maybe not. It doesn't matter. What does matter is that there is so much going on in this world, and we have the means to tell *everyone* about it, yet thanks to fools like you (if you truly adhere to what you just said), that whole instant global communications technological milestone for humanity thing just goes down the shitter by becoming yet another tool for people to use to get attention for profit. I think of puns and the like as SPAM, and look at all of that as a symptom of an apathetic and selfish populace ensuring their own demise and/or enslavement.

Sorry. Bad day.

Watch *these* downvotes roll in.. 




 Should probably note that a good 90% of these roads are protected by Smith and Wesson security systems (and barbed wire). 




 Best greasy breakfast tacos I have ever consumed can be found here:

Order the chorizo, bean, and cheese tacos. Your body will get stocked with enough fatty enzymes to clear up a bad hangover in minutes.

Also, we make our own Carne Guisada at home out of Brisket anyway :)

 




 The people of West need to spread fliers around the town and nearby cities that show pictures of the people involved in the WBC.

Businesses can and should reserve the right to refuse service to these people.

For all the times I have been pulled over in Texas and had my vehicle dumped out for no reason, you'd think some good would come from that in the form of it happening to these assholes.

There are a lot of things that can be done. People just need to be creative about it. I don't want to sit here and think about it because I will come up with something so devious that people are not likely to appreciate it.

If I didn't have six months of debt piled up from being an unemployed IT guy, I would go. I have to work Thursday and can't get around it, otherwise I would be right there fighting for the people of West. They have a long battle ahead of them - many don't know that the shockwave from the blast knocked out the water.

It would be a shame if a caravan of truckers blockaded their vehicles from leaving the hotel again. 




 No need for chemicals all over the place. Use these:

 Thanks. At first it looked like the side of that building blew off and hit the guy's car. It was just the camera moving that made the effect.

 What would be the point? He's a politician. Shit he says doesn't matter.

Might as well be a dirty joke.

But, if I could get him to say something and mean it, it would be along these lines:

 I've had lightning strike about 40' from me and don't remember feeling heat but it rattled me hard enough to knock me off balance and made my ears ring for a while. You must have been like 20 feet away! Go buy a lottery ticket! 




 Someone has to pick up the convo and turn it into some kind of pissing match. Might as well be you, eh?

 has anyone else noticed that ____ owners in particular drive like assholes?

I've noticed that people driving expensive vehicles in general act more entitled to the road than the rest of us poor bastards. On the other hand, it's pretty obvious when one of us poor bastards quits giving a fuck and will just slam into your nice ride for the hell of it. It's not like our rust bucket is going to lose any value.

 _____ drivers appear to drive as well as you'd expect from someone who would be proud to overpay for a _____.

Give me a fucking break man. Do people really think like this or are you two fuckwits just bullshitting with each other to pass the time? 




 Edit: After reading some of the comments telling me I shouldn't be concerned, that it's "none of my business", and that this post is "creepy", I have to wonder what the hell has happened to our society. Ever seen a news special on a kid who fell down a well, or who was kidnapped? Were you concerned? How is my daughter's and my concern for this victim any different? I grew up in this town and remember it as a close and caring community, but it was no different than anywhere else in America at that time (the 1970's). We cared about each other and were unafraid to check on our neighbors. I'm addressing the critics here, what the fuck is wrong with you?

This sub is notorious for being snobbish, and represents modern day Austin adequately in that regard - full of it's own first world problems and devoid of empathy for anything but a trendy tragedy.

It *is* sickening. The things that have made Austin unique have been disappearing at the same rate at which overpriced condos downtown are being occupied. This is an eventuality, an inevitable and inescapable result of the overpopulation by the human race which diseases our planet. As downtown grows and the sprawl expands into the countryside, we'll witness the last of traditional values leave this city in search of a return to normalcy.

Personally, I moved back to Austin to re-live some of the times I had with my father as a child, back when Ben White was a four lane road, if that. Now it's 100 feet in the air and 10 lanes wide, and the roar of that traffic can literally be heard for miles. I'm here to build better systems for both the public and private sector, and feel that I contribute to what progress is being made in a big way. One day I will no longer be able to handle the side effects of this progress and I too will pack up and leave in search of a plot of land to call my own, far from the crime and noise and hypocrisy plaguing any city. 




 So where was this picture taken? 




 This has almost nothing to do with your uterus or abortion or religion. To split the issue up by listening to that rhetoric is counter productive, but it does serve to point out their methods, which is a good thing to observe.

Instead, it might benefit you to look at it this way:

Hard line republicans want more babies out there so they can force more religion down more people's throats so they can have more slaves to pay taxes and more overpriced junk from their corporate cronies.

So they can have more money.

It's that easy. The more informed people are of the larger agenda, the less likely these assholes are to succeed. That they have been abusing religion, perpetuating mythology to benefit themselves and only themselves, is painfully obvious these days. Instant global communication for the masses has brought this into the light and then some.

Simply put, these people have nothing to offer the human race in terms of progress which makes them nothing more than parasites. Playing in to their hand by raising hell over individual issues completely distracts from the unity needed to get rid of these people outright by nailing them to their own crosses with the letter of the laws that this country was founded on. 




 vee vee might be an asshole sometimes but those comments are usually articulate and well thought out. yours was basically a vitriolic and ignorant shart of a thought aimed at a political party for nothing but their political affiliation.

you asked. 




 Most parking lot attendants look homeless as it is. 




 They should use that technology to power Austin with all the bullshit pouring out of the capitol building. 




 Gainfully employed is an antiquated term used to describe living above poverty, and you know it - just as the word "theory" is used in such rhetoric to ascribe doubt to an established truth.

The fact that you like my screen name says a lot about you as well. It was coined in response to a shill pretending that our water supply should be privatized by foreign interests.

Religious foreign interests at that. Good ol' capitalism at work for you right there. 




 Keep teaching your kids and grand kids stupid shit. That's what will get you in the end. It will have nothing to do with euthanasia. 




 The only thing we don't know for certain is what drives evolution this far.

That's what the *theory* in your sentence is about.

Aside from the altruism I should display, if I were to meet you I'd probably strangle you. Then, you'd have no kids.

Theorize about that. 




 Take a walk off the beaten path between your XBox and the nearest GameStop, and you'll find that the world is quite different IRL. 




 The article is definitely light on details. It's not like they are going to go around releasing information about the dead guy that might imply innocence.

I'm sure if there is anything that can be dug up on the victim it will surface once the "investigation" is complete. 




 then this story title is only useful for propagating hatred of police.

That depends on your perspective, doesn't it? Some people will read that title and automatically believe the guy got shot for a good reason, while the rest of the waking populace that has ever had an interaction with a fucked up cop is entitled to their opinion as well.

Personally, I don't need a sensationalized title to make me feel any less safe around cops. The experiences I've had with the police have taught me all I need to know about them. 




 First of all, you are Reddit, too.

Second, this is a major source of consternation because cops get special treatment and we probably won't hear much more about it other than the sound of a rubber stamp of approval.

Third, if this were just some guy with a CCW, he'd be dragged through the national media and defunct legal system like Zimmerman. 




 One can always hope. Unfortunately it is never in the interest of the PD to convict one of their own. It's always better for them to cover things up, make the cop look like a hero, and downplay the whole incident.

I will be truly surprised if we hear anything to the contrary. 




 And people are pissed about a donut ad. 




 Definitely relieved. I had a wierd mixture of excitement that I might get to see more Calvin and Hobbes, and then a sinking feeling that Macaulay Culkin was going to have a starring role. 




 Wish I could just blow away anyone who I "felt threatened" by.

Wait, no I don't, because I'm not a psychopath. I tend to work out differences with others through rational discussion and informed debate.

I'm reminded of a story about a fast food place being held up by robbers. The robbers had knives and one of the employees had a pistol and a CCW license.

The employee overheard the robbery from back in the kitchen and debated on pulling out his gun. He sat for a minute and listened, and the robbers were gone with a few bucks and otherwise without incident.

He could have ended those people's lives right there in front of everyone, but he assessed the situation and reacted in a logical manner.

Just because you may have the legal right to shoot someone dead does not constitute a good reason to do so, and just because you "feel threatened" does not mean you are in any danger or automatically grant you that right.

---

The cop says he felt threatened so he shot someone. That's probably all the "facts" we'll ever get. 




 That whole "procedure" where mentally ill people are all thrown by a judge, not a medical doctor, into tiny rooms together to torture each other instead of being treated. 




  I can't say why we interpret more clashy chords as sad or spooky; that may just be society. My theory is that they set you on edge just a little bit more.

I wonder what the evolutionary purpose, if any, would be for this? I wonder if there are any subconcious cues in "clashy" sounds that relate danger to us. Like the sound of a gorge, the doppler effect sound of water rushing down the side of a waterfall. Wouldn't that sound look something like a trainwreck on an oscilloscope compared with one of these pretty sounding major chords?

If there is a lion killing a pig in the jungle half a mile away, it's probably not going to sound like a lion killing a pig if you can hear it. It's probably going to sound distorted. The more distorted and dischordant a sound in the jungle, the more my curiosity would be piqued, if for nothing else to rule out danger. That is to say, if it's far away and bouncing off of trees and rocks for hundreds of yards, I think those waves are going to overlap to create a cacaphony. 

By contrast, closer sounds are easier to make out, and I think the amount of processing necessary to identify the sound as a threat or not is going to be proportional to how recognizeable that sound is.

I think our love for music stems from a survival instinct common to any organism with a nervous system capable of responding to vibration. 




 Just what that part of town needs. Another 2,000+ people on the road. Good luck with that traffic problem and all that. I think these building owners should be paying to alleviate that problem. We all know a 900 sq. ft. flat up there is going to cost $2000 a month. That building will rake in 5 million dollars a month forever, and hardly any of it will go to easing the congestion they cause.

I am all for development, but it just bothers me to see things like this with no real plan for the consequences.

I love living in the sticks and I hate driving to town. I wish my truck had missle launchers on it, or at least a PA system.

Austin is all grown up now, but the kid inside me will never lose his appreciation for quiet, starry nights. This place is going to look like Los Angeles in 15 years and there is no stopping it.

So sad. 




 Boycott petty entertainment. Problem solved. 




 Once you start working on cars you'll also base your buying decisions on how easily acessible engine parts are. For examle, had I known I was going to be replacing an AC in and F150, I wouldn't have bought the #$^@#$% thing. 




 What a deluded mind. I don't doubt that SWAT faces some pretty serious assholes on a fairly frequent basis, but to compare the local meth gang to the Taliban is nothing but a blatant attempt to garner support for creating para-military patrols in our streets.

I'm all for nabbing bad guys and locking them away, but lets be adults about this. No-knock warrants resulting in one death is one death too many. Now this shit happens how often? We hear about the police tazing/beating/neglecting/choking/shooting/running over some innocent person to death on a daily basis in this country. People's gardens being destroyed by what amounts to a gang of gun nuts with a grudge who are no better than the worst of criminals. 




 Police brutality is at an all time high. Or is it?

Wake me up when these sonsabitches are all wearing cameras. 




 Not to mention midnight raids of hospitals and firebombing of schools, and all that acid getting thrown in everyone's faces. 




 Texas Brine really screwed the pooch on this one. I wonder how big this thing will actually get. Wouldn't it be worth it to send dynamite down in there in order to have it collapse all at once instead of sucking up a house at a time or whatever? 




 Yahoo has always struck me as some whiny parasite that feeds off of other websites in some convoluted and misguided way that screams for attention. It's like an overbearing, nerdy cousin constantly injecting their uninformed opinion into the conversation.

Yahoo is largely irrelevant in my life and the only time I use their site is to search for things that Google can't find, and 99.9% of the time they can't find it either.

The only time Yahoo matters in my life is when they excrete 1000's of tech jobs they couldn't support and all the sudden the market is flooded again with everything from java developers and dbas to project managers and help desk techs. 









 *No gators were harmed in the making of this film.

**Unfortunately the nearby towns have been evacuated.

***Because Texas Brine. 




 I generally avoid goading condescending trolls into presenting such specious rhetoric but sometimes find it necessary in order to expose the contempt such utterly worthless narcissism has for humanity.

More and more descriptive labels are being put on our food and there is nothing any PR can do to stop it. Move on to some other critical aspect of survival to exploit before people see you for what you really are and you have to answer for your despicable manipulation of the ignorant and disadvantaged. 




 Why are you trying to bait me into some stupid GMO argument?  All I want is better labeling. Maybe you could take a look at my other comments in this thread before trying to put words in my mouth. 




 The labeling will reveal only what is required by law, obviously. Organic vs GMO, is a false dichotomy, a construct of industry and profit. If this can of tuna came from fish caught off the shore of the Daiichi power plant, or this avocado has been treated with 100% organic cyanide, or this steak was grown in a tube in the labs at Dow Chemical, I am going to want to know at least enough to where I can do an amount of research to adequately determine the probability of safety, or at least err on the side of caution.  Any new law should go that direction rather than make some political point.  

Sadly most people dont give a fuck, and since I do then I have to assume I am being treated like someone who doesnt care and remain cautious. 




 We have the right to know what is in our food and where it came from.

This is one of the most frustrating non-arguments out there. This should be inalienable. My concern is not with some random food producers profits. My concern is for the safety of my family. Any eftort to undermine my decision making abilites with regard to food safety  constitutes a bodily threat and will always be viewed as such. 




 The downvotes are a sad indicator. What you are saying is what I failed to verbalize to begin with. Thank you. 




 What a stupid thing to say. Someone died here. Grow up. 




 Fried cod is what I'm craving. I haven't been in years, but The Fox and the Hound if Ft. Worth and Houston had fried cod fillets the size of your forearm. For $11.99 I was able to get three of those monsters put on my plate because I was such a regular and good tipper at the one in Houston. Love that place. 




 I've never enjoyed the tiny fish they serve there. I'd be surprised if any of them were over a pound live. 




 Assuming you are still in Seattle, and thus homesick, here is why I love Texas:

You can drive for hours out on the back roads of west Texas without passing a soul.

You can drive 80-85 MPH on I-10 from Houston to El Paso and probably not get pulled over.

You can go deap sea fishing in the Gulf or you can catch monster cats in Livingston or Amistad.

You can tube the cool spring fed Comal and Frio rivers when its hot.

You can pack up and head to Lubbock or Amarillo to catch a snowy weekend when its cold.

Beach, beach, beach.. Port Aransas is where I want to retire.

More BBQ joints per capita than anywhere in the world. I just made that up but it's probably almost true.

Live music all over the damned place, all the time. Booming industries, great paying IT jobs.

Enough TexMex joints in a given city for you to eat well, eat different, and eat cheap 7 days a week. 




 I started out laughing at this like an insane child and then just ended up sobbing. I'm going back to sleep. 




 Since radioactive water is leaking into the pacific and groundwater is contaminated in the area, can someone tell me exactly how this could get any worse? 




 1. If knives were more dangerous than guns then law enforcement would carry knives instead of guns.

2. If you are in public you have no expectation of privacy, hence the term, "public". 




 Glad you are presenting arguments.

1. More evidence is good evidence. For example: cops routinely confiscate phones and cameras and delete evidence. I can't imagine that's because the video would portray anything but the truth, or help determine the truth.

2. We already live in an Orwellian surveillance society. The FBI and NSA spy on innocent people and have been for years. There are literally cameras at every street corner. 




 This is a) why people shouldn't feed deer, and b) why people shouldn't feed deer.

I live in Austin and deer are all over the place. They are in people's yards where kids are playing, and parents think it's cute.

Deer are well known to harbor disease and parasites that can infect humans. Many wild animals do. So do house pets, but ringworm and that gondii parasite are treatable to varying degrees. Lyme disease is not well understood, and if you know anyone that thinks they have it or has been diagnosed with it, you'd stay away from the wildlife too. 




 I get it. Take the fucking deer.

Confiscate cell phones and delete shit from them? WRONG. 




 Thank you for the insight. Until today I did not know that the private sector was involved in this. I have to admit that I am a little shocked by that.

I hope that one day our tax dollars go to a functional enough law enforcement agency to allow for responsible and efficient interdiction of unfit parents without private interests even being given the opportunity to place profit ahead the interests of abused children, or innocent parents for that matter.

This type of thing is an isolated incident and is capitalized upon by the anti-CPS crowd to point the finger at a system that I believe largely helps the children in it's care despite the occasional bad press.

I am sure there are some very upset parents out there who are mentally deficient enough to feel that their children were taken from them unjustly despite the rulings of the court. I am also sure that the courts have unjustly ruled against parents, although certainly not nearly as many. Unfortunately there is no simple solution to these problems.

One can only hope that effective oversight will be a priority. 




 Can you ask him how people with no source of income could possibly wind up as even candidates? I might be missing something, I didn't see where these people were well off, but there has to be some checks there. 




 TXDoT says it has no money for this project – and lobbying for funds could take decades.

Settles that. 




 Sorry, but the CPS are backed by "the cops".

CPS needs a wash, that's for sure, but giving control over that organization to an already arguably corrupt and trouble-ridden arm of the law is just asking for more problems than we can predict.
