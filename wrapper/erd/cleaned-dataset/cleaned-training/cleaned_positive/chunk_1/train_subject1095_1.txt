 The last line is pretty much the same as the first so how could I not? Of course it wasnt until after I read the whole thing did I realize I've been duped. 




 On the flipside generic canned ravioli is just as good as the name brand and you can get a bigger can for the same price as a regular one. 




 At least make it illegal to perform on infants who have absolutely no say in the matter. 




 I feel like I am the only who has never seen sushi at a gas station. 




 If anything it was an act of God for his chute not to open. 




 Pls no 




 I recall having some not too long ago. 




 I was gonna say Cocaine energy drink, but it was put back on sale not too long ago apparently. So I am going to say KMX energy drinks.  




 Yall dont happen to have coke with lime do yall? I'll totally trade a case of cherry coke of some. 




 I forgot all about those flatbreads :( 




 If I remember right these came up in an old thread and someone found a way to order them. . . 




 The Talib set-up is rather unique. . .set-ups like that are kinda hard to find...like a remote. 




 Ah Chingo Blingo. Had a chance to see him at a show in south Texas a while back. No one in my family wanted to go :/

"Gimme dat torta" 




 So edgy 




 Ah the Mighty Boosh. 




 I skipped to last line only and still assumed he was just a metal-enthusiast.  




 An excellent profession. Keep up the good work. 




 . . .patients? 




 Note to self: Duck Farts sound delicious. 




 You didnt get the memo? If you're virgin when you turn 30 you become a wizard. 




 I mostly only use .compact

It just sucks when a link to a different subreddit doesnt automatically turn to mobile. 




 I started/finished a multiple page paper over a court case the first few periods before it was due in class. I got a 90 on it. 




 How do rockets hover in place? 




 Sometimes when I just dont want the last bite. 




 That...makes sense 




 Goats are sheep now? 




 Doesnt making it into a puree sorta break the no lube rule? 




 And the fact 'n' and 'r' are pretty fucking far from each other on the keyboard. 




 What is this from? 




 Wat. . .wat is this toastman meme? 




 Poles? 




 I thought mouthbreathers was equivalent to neckbeards. . . 




 The fuck kind of gif is that? 




 Did. . .did you just kill yourself? 




 Perfume: Story of a Murderer did that for me.  




 El Mariachi, while Banderas probably couldn't reprise his role from the sequels it would be nice to see it made with a budget that isnt a couple hundred dollars. Still a great movie. 




 As a Catholic, I concur that most Catholics seemed to liked it. 




 Just remember everyday is another struggle, until you wake up one day realizing you arent struggling anymore. 




 Spice used to be a brand name of synthetics, but now it is just a common term to mean any synthetic weed. 




 Been over a year since I quit. Usually smoked 10g's Over 2-3 days, but had days where I would burn through a whole bag. Got pretty bad with it. I only smoked it out of a pipe so I would collect the ash/partially solid matter  and then shift it just enough to get the white ash off. Would basically smoke and resmoke until it just couldnt be lit anymore, strangely each hit was just as strong as a fresh bowl. Most days I would smoke until I pass out for like 15-30 minutes then toke up again repeating the process until lunch/dinner with the coma-naps getting longer as the day went on. I also woulx wake in the middle of the nightbjust for the sole purpose of getting another round in. Shit took its toll fast, mostly psychologically (sometimes voices but mostly just horrible paranoia/anxiety) but did notice chest pains and was constantly coughing shit up (tooks months of being off it to finally clear it up) I did pawn shit that was and wasn't mine to pawn just to get the next sack. Credit Cards were already pretty much maxed by the time I started using, but coincidentally my minimum payment was about as much as a sack was, so the cards stayed maxed out. 

My advice is to try to come to terms with the debt pile and slowly work it off. If you havent already, destroy the cards. You can always get new ones, but the wait for the replacements should help curb any craving or momentary loss of self-control. If you aren't completely ostrochised from your family, maybe have someone take control of your funds for a bit, the first couple months are always the hardest to resist the urge to re-up.

Invest in an e-cigarette. Doesn't even have to have nicotine in it. The act of blowing out smoke can help alleviate the urge to start smoking it again.

If your drug counselling is a group setting, try to be open to the others' stories and experiences. You might find some inspiration in their life experiences. 

They'll probably suggest this at counseling, but maybe look into a Narcotics Anonymous group. I never did do that, but it can definitly help with the healing process.

As for depression, that is a whole 'nother beast that I've struggled with my whole life. Hopefully yours is just due to temporary chemical imbalances and not hereditary. Either way /r/depression is a wounderful community at your disposal. 

Everything I said/suggested is purely from my own experience. Make sure you communicate with your doctors everything as they will know the best way to help you. 




 ...which is why you can usually be out and about if you are 17 or older. . . 




 I want to believe. 




 Moby. I was the only person I knew that likes him and just couldnt bring myself to go to his concert alone. 




 If anything he'll make a good manager, probably. 




 Yea it was definitly some kind of sketch pricing scheme, but shit a deals a deal when you just wanna get high. 




 Shit or even just a Christmas Special or something. 




   This whole debacle has potentially made that much more difficult here.

I think, if NZ is really going to have a rigorous screening process for the legal highs, then this will help with the education/protection for addicts regarding it all. I mean pretty much anyone can grow weed, but how many times have you heard of someone cooking up their own version of spice in their backyard? So as long as the new screening process isnt just a red herring that they hope people will forget about, then it will be more conducive to a healthier legal high culture.

 




 I don't know about other places, but when he had it in Texas it went for about $30/10g or $20/3g, depending on brand which is way cheaper than $20/g kush or $50/14g korn. Of course the perceived tolerance IME shoots up pretty high pretty fast with the synths so what you're saving just goes towards more of it. 




 I could see that. No accepted pharmaceutical use doesnt mean it cant be straight up recreational. 




 Times like that i smoke a little bowl then go on a long spree shifting through the ground up getting it as clean as possible. 




 I've noticed Indica's do the same thing to me mostly. You ever start noticing all the ambient noises around you and start putting voices to them? 




 Extreme Paranoia? Moldy Weed? Shady deals gone wrong? 

Any and all stories that others could learn from are appreciated.

Particularly looking for stories from users that don't/can't smoke anymore due to bad trips.  




 Easily could have been at Harvard, but smoked weed and played WoW last years of high school. Didn't walk but graduated the summer after one dual credit at a local community college. 




 FTA: "The New Zealand government's **testing regime**, expected to be **as rigorous as** that applied to **pharmaceutical drugs**, means that it could cost manufacturers of legal highs over $1 million NZD (£500,000) to have each product approved.

I'm sorry but I don't see the problem here. Is this not what we wanted? A stable product that isn't going to change its chemical make-up everytime a new law takes place? I don't pretend to know NZ politics, but I know as a former US spice user that I do wish I knew exactly what I was using and wish America did something along these lines instead of wave after wave of bans. 




 It was poorly advertised and was a rather limited release. 




 Mine would be the fan-made trailer about Robin.

For actual trailer it would have to the original spiderman with venom before he was redone in the final cut. 




 Step 1: Buy app store giftcards with all the dirty cash you want.

Step 2: Create $1k app

Step 3: Using bogus accounts spend the giftcards on your $1k app

Step 4: ???

Step 5: Profit 




 The second one wasn't half bad. A bit disappointed there weren't more 




 Grew up eating most fruits, but mango is the one that I just can't get past the texture of. Mango flavoring is pretty good however. 




 Pokemon reference. 




 IDK my BFF Jill? 




 "Urinals are out of order? That's ok the toilet seat will make sure I don't miss." 




 I love it straight up. Sipping licorice it feels like. 




 I remember not actually minding the grass and dirt ones back then. . . 




 One fun fact is that becore Usher was Usher he used to hang around with the Dungeon Family. 




 So you are saying that if the Doctor is to finally become a ginger make sure it is a famous ginger? 




 Imagine if they went back and actually redid El Mariachi. 




 Live-Action. . .Barbie? So are they going to CGI the star to look like barbie or make Barbies more realistic looking? 




 It's just the Housewives, dudette. 




 TiL Captain America is a wizard. 




 2 hours until tickets go up. . .any idea how much it'll cost? 




 I'd like to see the Smiths in Black Nativity 2. 




 So much dust under the screen! 




 I don't mind dark chocolate with some salt in it. 




 Unless it's some jazz. 




 What exactly did you find to be ignorant? 




 Would love to see a word cloud of the comments. 




 Am I the only one who hates OP for not showing #6? 




 Shit I'm on mobile, but looking at wikipedia I believe it is S5 E25. 




 I had friends that had that teacher. Everything he said was spot on about her. 




 This happened last year and teacher has since been reprimanded. 




 So glorious. 




 Not to mention he was featured on Tosh.0. 




 I mean it is Duncanville, Texas after all. . . 




 Currently fasting before my physical in 5 hours. . .I know what my first meal will be! 




 Is that like the Mcdank? A McDouble with a McChicken in the middle of it? 




 . . .And? 














 I've had this app for two months now and it still won't work. Anyone else having issues with it? 









 Man fuck this last year. Fuck it royally. Fuck the fact that I got promoted. Fuck the fact I kicked the several year long spice habit. Fuck the fact I got laid for the first and only time. Fuck it all. I still fucked up at school for the 3 or 4th time and am probably suspended from the system. . . again...I still drove her away with the creepiness and general beta-mindset. . ..still broke all the time cause I have poor money management skills...behind a couple months on my cards and will have student loans starting up again now that I'm out of school..
Fuck the fact old friends are back in town graduated and not responding to texts or calls. ..man fuckall this. At least I have my music.

Only people to remember it's my birthday is my ma, cousin, sister. Oh yea and the student loan company emailing me happy birthday trying to collect. But it's cool I get free movie tickets whenever I want. Oh and I get free stuff today at the smoke shop...
 




 So I've been looking for the lyrics for Big Rube 4:38 (Interlude) On Cool Breeze's Album and have had zero luck. It is even omitted from rapgenius. I was wondering if anyone knows whats up with that and if anyone has said lyrics. 
























 Now this week they added my state to their no ship list. . . Am I just incredibly lucky or did I get them in trouble? LOL 




 Would you play them straight through, or would you start out with some highlights? 




 As seen on Snoop Lion [here](http://i.imgur.com/v2OxaH7.jpg) 

I have always been a fan of that style headwear, but just never could find them.

First, what are they called?

Second, I'm not really looking for that color scheme per se, just one that'll work well on St. Patrick's Day.

Much Obliged.

 




 I personally am ~~5th~~ 6th Gen.
