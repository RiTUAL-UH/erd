 Thank you :-) 




 Hey r/Denver, We have moved from the UK to Aurora and I'm trying to register with a doctor in the 80015 area. The Dr that came with the best recommendation from friends doesn't have an appointment for registering until October, and as I think I may have tendonitis in my shoulder, I don't really want to wait that long to be able to see someone! Does anyone have a good Dr in this area? I need a Dr that accepts GWH-CIGNA and preferably a Family Medicine or General Medicine Dr.

Thanks in advance r/Denver :-) You guys rock! 




 Apparently there was a funnel cloud sighted to the NE but I havent heard from anyone yet who saw it. Most people just went outside on hearing the sirens as it was pretty clear here. Crazy people :-) 




 and they all went off in Aurora a couple of hours ago :-)
 




 Moved here 8 weeks ago, the lips I can cope with, but the boogers, aww man they get me every day :-(  




 MRI? 




 This. But make sure you know your left from your right - nearly got taken out yesterday by someone on a bike yelling 'on your right' and passing on my left! She did appologise though :-)
 




 Wow, 5 heart attacks since he was 37... 









 Just got back from the park with the kids, so warm out :-)
 




 Dam you! I just spat coffee on my screen. 




 Upvote for being awesome 




 I had that LP! 




 ''Also I hear orgasms can make breastmilk shoot out so I have this weird image of it hitting his face like a watergun''
It totally does. 




 Yay 303'ers :) 




 Happy Birthday! 




 Dreyers Girl Scout Cookie Limited Edition Samoas Flavour.

Oh my god.


And yes, I've only been here (in the US) three weeks :) 




 lol 




 no no no no!
 




 Nope, 13 items in unacceptable, it needs to be a nice even number. Or ending in a 5 at a push!
 









 9 month old though :(
 




 We are moving to Denver in 14 days!! 




 Seriously? You only just noticed and didn't see anything of it before?? It's been front page ALL week :S 




 The Sonic was the 1st game I ever completed on my own. Still remember sitting in my living room with my mum and dad and feeling that sense of achievement. They didn't really get it but seemed impressed that I'd kept going at something that long. 




 FFS I actually teared up a little. God damn hormones.
 




 Moving house and have just found my old Game Gear (powering up but screen not working) and also 10 old games. My dad bought these when the Game Gear 1st came out. 

I have - Sonic, Sonic 2, Columns, Echo the Dolphin, Olympic Gold, Pengo, Halley Wars, Mickey Mouse - Castle of Illusion, Super Monaco GP and Jurassic park.

Are these things collected or even wanted anymore?

Does anyone on here want them? (I am in the UK btw)

p.s I actually wanted a Game Boy but my dad was swayed by the salesman talk of the colour screen! 




 I had A Game of Thrones - "Come South with me, and I'll teach you how to laugh again," the King promised. 

Sounds promising. 




 Sadly it makes financial sense to follow my husbands work! I have gotten used to moving around, but this is one of my favorite places :) 




 Should have added that I'm moving from a quiet little village in the UK to mid-west USA. I'm gonna miss my beach! 









 Pretty much what the title says! 









 Thank you! I am swollen up one side of my face but look more like I have eaten too many chocolates! Hope you are feeling better soon :) 




 The previous time I had a tooth out it really didn't hurt at all either! I had to have surgery to get the lower one out hence all the pain (and stitches) my jaw bone hurts more than the gum if you know what I mean. Hope you heal quickly. 









 THIS. 

After losing a baby, a lot of 'well meaning' people would say unhelpful things to me such as 'ah, you'll just have to get trying for the next one' 'it's for the best' ' these things happen for a reason' 'it wasn't a baby yet anyway (seriously WTF!)' I hated these comments as my baby was already a huge part of my life and on my mind every second of every day. If you know people who may say these sorts of things, get between them and your wife and try to fend off these comments. In my very emotional state I nearly punched a friend of a friend in the face for her advice. Losing your child is an awful experience. 

Be there, listen and be open with her too. You may find she is unable to process your grief over hers which can lead to resentment between the two of you. Make sure you both have other people to open up to - yes, you as well. 

Take time to mourn and make a little box of mementos. You may not want to look at it for years, but one day you will want those memories and it would be awful not to have them. We have a small fairy/angel statue in our living room in memory of our baby. It's small and discrete but it's always there with me.

EDIT spelling 




 Me too 




 NOPE 




 TIL you can't access that page from the UK. Wierd. 




 not sure why I got a downvote here - I was being sincere! 




 Thanks for the link 









 I'm hypermobile and it's visible in most of my joints. My fingers, thumbs, knees, ankles and shoulders are the worst. I've had to have three knee ops to sort out the cartilage and if I sleep in the wrong position or overstretch for something I dislocate my shoulder out :) 









 apparently mine means 'from the monastery town'. My old surname is even more dull and means 'a long piece of land'.

 Ah, APC. Had this song playing as part of my wedding service. 




 I have had a few, having to report suspicion of child abuse for work, calling my dad after my Grandma died suddenly, calling my younger sister to tell her that my mum had left my dad. All left me feeling sick and shaky, still feel it when I think of it now. 




 came here to say the same (though agree with the rest that this is really not WTF after some of the things I've seen today) 




 I'm really glad you are doing better :) It is really hard when things are getting too much to get back on top of it all so well done!
I'm good thanks, get some big plans coming up but looking forward to a new challenge and a more positive time in my life!
Take care x 









 APGAR can be done visually, has been with both of mine whilst I gave them their 1st feed.  




 So rape, murder, abuse et al have disappeared? I want to live in your world. 




 and I have every sympathy for the whole family. No one should have to go through losing a loved one be it from any circumstance. But sometimes people can only see one way out regardless of medication, intervention, or even 'manning-up' as was suggested to me (and by the way I am very much a female!) There will always be a situation that pushes someone too far and takes them so far from the factual situation into the realms of the depression that they do not feel they can get out. And that in itself is depressing enough. I live everyday with the memory of coming so close and despite all the counselling, medication and CBT that I have had, there is always that little insecurity in me that says what if I go there again? Am I strong enough now?

A study into the interwoven nature of pain and depression.
I am aware it is more from the pain perspective but still has some very good points. 




 Now I am a pretty nice person IRL , but you sir really piss me off.

Have you ever dealt with severe depression?
 I deal with it every day of my life.

Have you ever been suicidal?
I have, and only now can I look back and thank fuck that I could be helped.

And if you care to actually get your trolling arse off reddit and check out  some facts you will find plenty of creditable information on the physical aspects of severe depression. However, I doubt you will do this as it will take away precious time from writing ridiculously contrived replies to serious conversations.  




 Hi, its been 2 months since your post and I was wondering how you were doing?

Hope life is treating you well. 




 You clearly have no experience of depression. It IS at the worst  times the most unbearable pain and it does have excruciating physical effects. Imagine wanting to rip your own heart out to take away the sadness, anguish and pain. Now live with that every minute of every day. 




 In my experience, depression IS some crazy fucking mental illness. Try living with it for 20 years or so and see how you feel...then judge people however you want. 




 In the depths of despair you can truly believe that by killing yourself you are relieving the surviving family of the 'felt' horror of having to see you down, despondent and hopeless everyday. You truly believe in your heart that they will be better without you and they will be able to do more, and in fact be happier without the pressure of having to 'look after' or care for you. In deep depression you have no self worth, thoughts of suicide come along and all you can see is how much better everyone's life would be without you there.

You cannot judge a man unless you have truly walked in his shoes. 




 It was most certainly not spiderbro! I have a tiny spiderbro in the kitchen and have been using him to get more accustomed to arachnids. This bastard was big, mean and hairy!  




 I have never been brave enough to kill one before...and it was fricking huge! 




 Thank you kindly for that explanation! It seems a little like the job benefit system over here. If you don't have a job (choice/situation or whatever) you receive reasonably large amounts of money from the government to 'provide' a basic living allowance. A lot of people use this system to exploit loopholes to gain free childcare, tax exemption,  medical cost exemptions (dentistry and ophthalmology) and live very comfortably without working at all. My husband and I both work, but have to pay all childcare costs involved as well as medical costs and our taxes, as we do not qualify for any assistance despite the government wanting both parents working and promoting 'benefits' to encourage this.
All I can say about having a second child is that it is actually a lot easier than I expected, and when they are slightly older it is lovely to have them playing together to allow me some time to do housework!

Good luck! 









 That's fair enough, as I said I'd fully understand health implications. Even in the UK it is highly probable that a woman will have an elective c/section after a previous c/s. 
I struggle to understand the US health system and how those less advantaged are able to ensure that they have good medical advice and assistance during the antenatal and birthing period (and at other times). In the UK I have had two children, both times in hospital (inductions due to pregnancy induced medical conditions) and I couldn't imagine how we could have afforded medical care on top of the costs a baby alone brings. I hope all goes well and that your SO has a trouble free birth! 




 totally 









 OP out of interest why do you deem a Cesarian a 'regular' delivery? Obv if there are health implications I'd fully understand, but otherwise surely you'd be saving money by a standard vaginal birth?
(I'm from the UK and always suprised by the tv programs showing US hospital births - there seems to be a LOT more intervention and medical assistance than I have experienced over here. Only going by what I've seen about the US on tv though so feel free to correct me!)

 damn cant make out the text... 









 I always loathed taking medications and am currently debating my current meds as they are making me disconnected rather than enabling me to cope. For myself it was accepting that this will get better but may never go away and recognizing that I have a chemical imbalance that requires medication (I don't make enough serotonin and therefore fall into deep depressive episodes). If I were diabetic and not making enough insulin I'm sure I wouldn't think twice about medicating. Is there really any difference? I struggled for a long time with the concept of anti-depressants and feeling a failure for having the depression. I would go on and off meds believing I was 'better'. Sure I would be for a while, but unless I stayed well away from anything disruptive to life or stressful it all came straight back.

I have just started another round of counseling for CBT to try and help out with the depression and anxiety issues I have. Not sure how it's going to go but willing to do the homework and listen to what they say.

I have often though about ending it all, but thankfully have managed to talk to someone in time. It is hard to stay positive and to deal with the good days and bad days (esp when there are usually more bad than good).

Keep talking, keep social if possible, tell the docs/psychs if the meds aren't working. 




 my baby starts school tomorrow, this post made me cry.
