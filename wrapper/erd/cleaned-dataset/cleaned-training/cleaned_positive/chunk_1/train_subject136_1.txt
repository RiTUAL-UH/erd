 Its a little low on activity though.  :( 




 my credit is shot due to the holidays

Wait... what?!? How does that happen? 




 yes!! 




 It seems like this should exist already but basically what I'm looking for is a place for people who are already employed to discuss their daily work lives.

I guess watercooler talk, if that makes sense. 




 Exactly.  I'd waste even more time if I was trying to socialize.  Plus music helps me stay motivated. 




 These are good points and I'd add that since the OP has been a homeowner he should already have a good grasp on what to look for in a property.

Trust your experience.  Worst case you can leave in a year. 




 Holy crap white people are crazy! 




 Well, I'm trying to revamp my wardrobe piece by piece but my mind goes blank when I get to the store.  I'm thinking I'd rather go into the store with a plan because I mostly buy clothes when I need them or when I see a really good sale.  What happens is I buy something but it doesn't really fit what I already own.  I want to gradually upgrade my wardrobe. 




 Dangit...  Photoshop seems like too much work.  




 My biggest weakness is putting it all together.  I'll buy a fine piece here or there but not know what I need to layer it with.  I'm starting to just look at the models on clothing websites and try to piece together a matching outfit.

I'm wondering if there is something out there that would allow me to place virtual clothing on an avatar or mannequin for every piece of clothing along with a bevy of options.  Something like what you see in the create a player mode in video games but focused on clothing only.


TL;DR:  I want to be able to piece together entire outfits in a virtual setting. 




 I disagree.  It's a major pain to cancel XM radio.  They lure you with that sweet deal hoping you forget.  Then when the deal runs out they try to do it again and again.

There's no way to cancel online and you HAVE to go through their phone system and reps to cancel.  It's like trying to dump someone who hasn't faced reality.

I know XM was more than happy to offer me the discounted rate three times until I finally stood firm.   




 Looks fine to me.  Especially in the setting you described. 




 Sounds like a mob threat. 




 I'm a guy and I have it. It was a nickel sized patch in the back of my head when young.  I tried creams and injections and eventually just settled on a style that kept it low and faded in the back.

Now I'm 29 and it looks like its coming back at my right temple so it looks like I'm balding on one side.  It sucks because the dermatologists are no help.  I think its stress related. I wish there was a cure.  




 On another board I frequent someone asked "what's the point of no fap challenges?"



And someone retorted with this:


an occasional fap session is fine...  but i agree...daily? thats way too much... cats here go from one extreme to the next....  theres no middle ground... either you guys fap 10 times a day or you have to go 90 days fap-free....  moderation is the key to life...learn it.


Thoughts?  I thought he made a good point

 Burp. I literally can't.  :-(  




 Pardon my ignorance, but what's an REO? 




 Yeah after looking at all the math and seeing how I might be staying here awhile I can't justify renting.

Even if it turned out to be $800 a month that's still considerably less than $1050 which I'm sure will go up when its time to renew. 




 Works for me!  this is great 




 Can I just be nice and pay you to do your job?  I'm not into bringing gifts, baked goods, and all that other stuff. 




 Based off of what you wrote, I'd cut him off.  As a man that dated a chick for 7 years and didn't really appreciate her until she left... Believe me when I say you have to move on.  It's tough and initially it will be painful but he seems a lot like I was.  Don't let your fantasy of a "great love story followed by a happy ending" cloud the truth that is right in front of you. 




 Wow.  You've given me much to think about.  I don't think i'll have to deal with that worst case scenario situation but I can't predict the future either.


I still want a townhouse but I will now expand my search to houses as well.  Since buying a snowblower and paying someone to do my lawn will be cheaper in the long run anyway.  Thanks. 




 HOA is $120 a month.  $435 not including taxes. 




 Location: Des Moines, IA.
HOA fees are around $120 a month.
I'm a senior engineer for a Fortune 100 company based in the midwest.  My job is as stable as it gets.

Anything else?  I'm more than willing to answer questions so I can make an informed decision.

Why do you guys hate townhouses?  I used to as well until I saw my coworker's setup and the low costs he was paying.  It makes sense for a young professional. 




 Here's my story.  I bought my first home about 3 years ago in GA with the First Time Homeowner's credit.  I had to move two years later and lost $20k on that home.  (Luckily I didn't have to pay the govt their $8K back)

Fast forward to now.  I've been renting a townhouse in my Iowa for about a year and a half.  My rent is $1050.  I can get similar and newer townhouse for $100K and a mortgage of $435.  The area seems stable and is actually being built up.

My questions... 

1.  Is there anything I'm not considering?  I don't want to get burnt again.
2.  Will the market ever pick up again?  I foolishly bought 3 years ago thinking rates couldnt get any lower.

I want a townhouse because I don't want to deal with the maintenance of a yard in this climate.  My thought process is worst case scenario I could always rent it and my company buys the house for market value if the ask me to move. 




 You need to look at all the other costs as well.  Is there an HOA?  what will your property taxes be?  Maintenance? upkeep?  etc.

The difference is only $75.  That's not that drastic. 




 This is honestly where I'm trying to get.  I want to be able to interchance work and play clothes seamlessly.  Any tips? 









 Doesn't matter.  The internet sleuths will track it down in a matter of minutes and it would be publicized anyway. 




 I felt like I had found the cheat code to life.

To be fair, I tried to break up numerous times but my gf was in denial and wouldn't let me go. 




 If I'm driving and see someone trying to cut over into my lane at the last second to bypass a line of cars I'll purposely box them out.

Wait in line like the rest of us. 




 Woman.  Because they put so much value into their appearance anyway. 




 While true, I have a corporate job now.  That iron from college has to go!

If the guy has a job, he needs an iron. 




 TIL:  A protractor is now a necessity when eating out. 




 Turns out it was this:

The oring was letting air into my power steering pump.  Thanks for answering though. 




 Record collecting.  When starting out, Goodwill and thrift stores are your friend.  Also, old relatives have a wealth of vinyl they don't listen to anymore. 




 My 2006 Honda Accord makes a horrible whiny sound when I turn the steering wheel in cold weather.  After the car gets warm it goes away.

I've checked the power steering fluid and its fine.  What do I need to know before taking it to a mechanic? 




 Grown men crawling around in air ducts. 




 I thought I was the only one. lol 




 Oh I see now, you're mixed.  I didn't see the comments earlier where you mentioned it.  I was trying to visualize a dark skinned woman with fine caucasian hair and couldn't...

Even with the face blurred out you seem pretty attractive. 




 Black with white hair?!?!?  :mindblown:

I'm black btw.  I'm trying to picture a visual here.  A picture (with face blurred out) would do wonders. 




 I have a friend that's in the hospital.  I need an idea of something to bring.  I feel like flowers and balloons aren't manly at all. 




 This may help some of you out there.  I'm a 29 year old bachelor who makes enough money to buy whatever he wants.  But never buys what he needs.  Heres' a list of things I need that are inexpensive and would totally bring a smile to my face if I got them for Christmas.  

**Iron** -  I've been using the same cheap iron I had in college.  An upgrade to a decent one around $50 would be very useful.

**Vacuum** - Same as above.  A man is unlikely to buy himself a new vacuum.

**Nice Kitchenware (pots, knives, blender, etc)** - A nice pot here or there would be great.  When I need something I always go cheap.  Someone else springing $60 for that nice pot or a set of quality knives would be great.  I recently tried to make a cheesecake without a mixer and shredded cabbage without a food processor.  The experience was terrible.  I need new kitchenware bad!

**Logitech Harmony Remote** - I keep losing my remotes.  I need to consolidate.

**AA/AAA Batteries** -  Cheap.  But who's gonna turn down batteries?!?

**Dress Socks** - I can't explain it, but I always need some. 

Just some suggestions. 




 Nice.  I'm stealing this! 




 Hijack away, that would be awesome as well. 




 I'm new and interesting in learning more about Stoicism.  I'm a visual an audatory learner.  I will defintely read the literature at some point but I would like to know if there are other forms of media about Stoicism. 




 An interesting by product of this is your daughter is learning French 




 Even without the electronic communication if it can still focus manually it will be a good lens.  I use a NEX 3 with a prime Canon 50mm lens and its my best lens bar none.  Even with manual focus. 




 Settings?
