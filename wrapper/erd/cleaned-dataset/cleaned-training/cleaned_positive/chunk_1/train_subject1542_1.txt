 your transformation is one of the best i've seen. how long did that take? 




 damn that was dark and smart. i like 




 Love it. Thank you. this is the reason I posted. To see what other people know. For supplementation do you mean the non-natty athletes?  




 whoa this is super interesting. thanks for this 




 yoooo yeah you've told me before and you're absolutely right. i just wanted to add for the macros trend, even if you think you're eating right, remember to watch sugar intake too. no substitute for eating clean though 




 Swimming is great cardio. Something funny and kind of counter intuitive: the worse you are at a movement, the more calories you'll burn while doing it. So in a way, if you're bad at swimming or your technique isn't the best, it's actually better exercise because you'll be expending more energy to do your laps. 

And yeah, if you have the energy/ time, more than 3x a week is even better. Go for it! 




 That's cool. I'm sure you're right. Thai fighters that fight on a more international level aren't going to be able to win by standing right there and trading with someone that actually moves around to avoid the shots. I think Buakaw has pretty good movement too. Don't know if its dutch kickboxing, but yeah 




 Hey, it's great that you're trying to make a change. What "ShitLordStu" says is right. You definitely have to start by monitoring your food intake. If you're willing to track your meals, I'd suggest starting with http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/ 

it definitely helped me a lot. If you don't have access to weights or machines, it's really not a problem. Start with cardio and body weight exercises. Sprints 3 days a week, and depending on your ability, start with pushups, situps, jump squats, pistol squats, pullups (if you have a bar). You can definitely use the heavy bag for cardio if you have gloves. Bike is a great form of cardio too. 30 minute high intensity bike rides would help a lot.  




 As someone who suffers from this, I started to look into the topic a bit more. I know the most truthful and basic answer is calories in vs. calories out, but I've been tracking my food for a while, and still been frustrated by my lack of results. I thought there must have been something I was missing. If you're pretty lean up top but seem to be storing fat down low, it could be a hormonal imbalance. 

Estrogen and testosterone are frequently deemed the "female" and "male" hormones, respectively, but both sexes have the two hormones. Males that tend to store fat on the back of the triceps, the hips, buttocks, and thighs are likely to have higher levels of estrogen. 

One of the biggest causes of estrogen/testosterone imbalances is blood sugar levels. A lot of males vary in their ability to metabolize estrogen, some bodybuilders and athletes can eat up to 6 donuts a day and still look absolutely ripped. But, other males can be very sensitive to sugar, and this can be one of the leading causes of weight gain. 

Hopefully I can post some progress pictures soon, but I'm definitely seeing some good results after regulating my sugar intake. I'm 23, 6'0, 175-180 lbs. I've been eating about 2200 kcal, (165C, 220P, 73F #iifym) and 60g of sugar, and it's definitely helped a lot. It was hard at first, I think there was some level of sugar dependency, but after about 2 weeks, it started to get a lot easier. For some people, every calorie may be the same, but I learned that it definitely isn't the case for me. Getting carbs from an apple vs. from a donut has very different effects on me. 

Obviously I'm no endocrinologist, and I'm still pretty new to this, but I noticed that there wasn't really a thread for this topic. I'd love to hear /r/fitness thoughts and experiences on it. Here are some pretty good links I read.

 correct me if im wrong. seems like there is significantly less use of angles in thailand muay thai. they stand and exchange directly in front of each other. other than stepping out at a 45 to throw the roundhouse 




 watched every game season and post season and have to say i agree. when cp lets blake lead the break, and blake picks it up early and gets to the rim, it's fine, but yeah. when he tries to dribble past the defenders.. no good 




 lol this was a sad fight. looked like a mismatch right away
