 I've been SH free for a little while now, but the urges are getting too strong and too frequent. I don't think I can resist it for much longer.

Edit: I gave in to the urges. Sorry. I appreciate those who replied and tried to help and I'll try harder to resist in the future :(  




 That's awesome! It may not feel like it, but it's the little things that count :)  




 I've always done this, without even really thinking about it or realising.  




 I have a Z2, I'm the exact same! 









 thanks :)  




 Thank you, it's nice to hear that from someone :) 




 Thanks :3  




 Just wanted to say it. I don't have anyone else to really talk to. But yeah, 50 days self harm free. 




 Quackers 




 I've been prescribed them for depression/self harming, and social anxiety. 




 Yeah, I've been feeling that way too but somehow I've always gone back to it. Thanks for the reply too :)  




 Thanks for the reply :) I'll try doing more positive activities when I feel that way :) 




 I do. Practically every night I sleep in this position, I find it strangely comfortable.
