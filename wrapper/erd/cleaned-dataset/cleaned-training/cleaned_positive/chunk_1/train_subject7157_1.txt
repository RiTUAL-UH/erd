 EDIT: to clarify the question, mid-range Top 5 Best Brands... I have seen the sidebar. I'm just curious to find out what you guys like. 




 Okay, thanks for your reply. I couldn't find the tuition on their website (Empire Beauty School) - I may have overlooked. I will keep researching. 




 I'm on Lexapro. I just started taking it on April 23rd.  Wasn't too long ago.

The doctor diagnosed me with chronic depression (I've had depression since I was 11/12 years old... I'm 26 now) and anxiety. He felt Lexapro would be a good start for me to be on it.

With the medication, it does help but lately for some reason, I'm always up this late and I would go to bed at 2am.  Then again, it may not be related to the medication. I feel my body running on fumes. I'm exhausted.  Though I feel the need to be on computer often now because I find myself becoming more entertained on it. I feel the need to research and find new ideas in life.  Am I trying too hard to pursue, trying to get my life back in order? To make up for lost times?? I don't know, I don't get myself.  I still find myself, staying inside at my home and I would be on computer most of the time.

I think it's fear of change.  There are times when I would think that change is good. It's nice doing something different.  But there are times when I would lose interest, no motivation to do something different, to do something productive and I would try, at all cost, to avoid change because I am feeling comfortable with the way I am and how I am.

I am still adjusting to the medication so the question would be when would it start working for me? I know the doctor said it may take 4 to 6 weeks to take in full effect of the medication.

Maybe I'm impatient, I don't know. I just want to live my life. 




 This is my first time, posting this in MakeupAddiction... so bear with me... It's after midnight. I may have not made sense in this entry so feel free to comment with your questions and I will try to clarify as best as I can.

I have done my research and is hoping to pursue in attending to a beauty school soon.

I was wondering if there are others who have already attended or is currently attending to a beauty school... because there is a school in Rochester, NY (I am located there). It's called Empire Beauty School and they have the Make Up program.  I am trying to find out how much it would cost to attend to a beauty school.

But not only am I looking into that, I am hoping to see if I could find a school that does have a major in a program that would allow me to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Make Up (or in Cosmetics). I don't know if there is one but it would be incredible and it would allow me to explore further with the makeup trends.

Do you have any recommendations with beauty schools?? Any ideas or tips? 




 I hope the op don't mind if I add my question in this because we're basically discussing the same thing - ChaosProz and I are from VA so yes, I know the op.  My car's title belongs to my mother but the car was given to me so in order to transfer the title to me, PLUS changing from VA to NY plates... I know the answer now with how much to get NY plates... but how does title work? Does it cost extra money? What do I need to prepare for when I go in DMV to get it all done? 




 I lost my first dog, Harley (she was a miniature schnauzer and she was only nine years old), two years ago (I was also 24 - I'm turning 26 in two days, this Saturday the 21st) and I never realized how much the passing of her really was devastating me.  I was already dealing with depression and this loss was **really** painful.  I knew I needed to talk to someone outside of my husband, my family, and friends so I wanted to try to talk to someone in therapy.  It did help every session I went.  So maybe try therapy in your own time when you're ready.

I'm sorry for your loss, and I truly understand. Sending positive light and love your way with your family. 




 I just don't agree with breaking up over text - that just shows immaturity on her part. I think she could have just talked to you about it in person. I would understand why she want to avoid arguing but that's the whole point of a relationship - to actually communicate with each other.  If not arguing, it could give you guys a chance to agree in mutual terms. 




 I just feel a bit conflicted with this one because the way I was taught by an instructor, she had told me I don't really need music or any kind of distractions to get in the way while I meditate. Otherwise it would have defeat the purpose of silencing your mind, body and soul and listen to your own breathing, to become one with yourself.  I just feel that music helps a bit to relax.  

I have deep anxiety and I try to meditate as much as I can to fit in my busy schedule. I overthink so much, it takes control of me.  And I can't help feeling it all at once when I overthink, even I am more aware that I am overreacting but I just can't seem to take control and recognize I am overthinking.

Any tips or ideas how to quiet my mind down? 




 One step at a time!! :) 




 25/f - wanting kids probably next year or so with the husband (24). We just got married in August. :)
