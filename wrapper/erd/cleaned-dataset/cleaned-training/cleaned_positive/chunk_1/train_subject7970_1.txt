 I would love to see a viewsync or something from Anderz, Keralis and the others that were in that same town, so I can figure out who is shooting when etcetera. 




 Oh was it Keralis? I just watched Anderz' episode from the edge of my chair, I think his video is shorter than other people's episodes. :( 




 The custom death messages are part of Flan's mod, I don't think you can change that. 




 Then you haven't seen Anderz' episode yet. That cliffhanger!! 




 I was told there are 49 people from Amsterdam with a clubcard for PEC Zwolle, while there's only 1 person from Emmeloord and 1 person from Urk (two places near Zwolle), lol! 




 I work at a Dutch football stadium and I can confirm Ultras can be great people. I always work at the unit underneath the Ultras stand. It was a bad day if our unit hadn't been shaking on its base. I just love the ambiance and the way they support the players on the field.

I am glad you are okay after the riot! 




 Welcome back! 




 I literally just tuned in to the stream when he brought his face really close to the camera, oh my xD 




 Me too! I started the map but I got really frustrated because of all the mobs, but I had a lot of fun trying to find more secrets and playing with MineChem. 




 If you don't like it, don't watch it and don't come here tell everyone you don't like it. It's so easy to avoid a video on YouTube. 




 Thanks for fixing that. I'm sure /u/parcel31u would appreciate it. 




 I still think it might be the person who donated the most money to be whitelisted on the server for a day. It might have taken a while before they could verify it was him who donated the money etcetera and the videos from yesterday and today all have probably been recorded around the same time. 




 I think they will get it eventually ;-) 




 No they have to rename the paper in the anvil and then insert the piece of paper in the hopper. 




 They are starting to figure it out at the end of the episode so I guess I can tell. They have to collect the books and have to make a word like they were trying. So 1E means the first letter is an E, etcetera. 




 That's really cool! :D 




 It's too bad I've seen the Yogscast play this map because I know where this is going, but this is hilarious anyway. Too bad they didn't watch the link as well :D 




 Absolutely. His tutorials are very clear, he told the last few bits I was missing until I understood bee breeding completely. 




 Maybe it's a repeatable quest. I'm not sure if they count in the x% completed under the chapter names. 




 Yup, same for me. Had the B-team flair for a while, then Team 77 Chads of Anderz during UHC, followed by Team PWN till the end of UHC. I recently started watching more Mindcrackers than just the B-team like I used to and they are indeed equally awesome. Although /u/TranceRealistic's solution is also a possibility lol! 




 I do not have a "best" mindcracker, I literally can't decide who to choose for. I'm "too new" to Mindcrack to have an awesome vintage flair :( I had B-team for a while but just recently started watching other Mindcrackers again, and damn they are all amazing people! 




 One of my best friends supports Ajax and he said to me last Tuesday, the afternoon for the match: "Gee, they're gonna broadcast another slaughter tonight. It's Barcelona against Ajax." full of sarcasm :P 




 BUDDONS 




 I really like your picture with Aureylian! :D 




 Maybe the person who paid a lot to get on the server for a day? 




 Avidya = Milk bucket! 




 I still can't get over Duncan's and Simon's bits. :') 




 Thanks for the explanation. A sand - dirt converter is really smart! 




 Woah, TIL. 




 BTC should keep the pumpkins until Halloween is over. This is a great prank and it actually looks really cool like that! 




 Another great episode from Bdubs. I am really enjoying his content lately :) Excited to see what the secret project is! 




 Woah 6312 points already, way to go Millbee! 




 I think that's fair. The more points you have, the better you are, therefore you should be able to win so that's when you get some points. 




 That's amazing! 




 I can't see why you should adress Jamiro. If he stops posting all the videos, there will be someone else taking over his 'task' here. It's the downvoters you have to get rid off. I am actually really glad Jamiro and also NotYorkiePudding are keeping this subreddit up to date with the latest videos. I don't think Jamiro has caused any of this, it's the karmaphilic people around here. 




 I've barely ever used the 'Hot' page, only during UHC's so I can easily find the thread because sometimes it's not stickied yet. And I just upvote every video I see from a Mindcracker, it's as easy as it gets. I don't watch every single video (I'd love to but there's only 24hrs in a day and I have more than Mindcrack in my life) but it's still support towards them. 




 I saw this only yesterday, cracked me up. [Melons for Baj!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh-AkzNsjkA) 




 I saw the minion in Genny's "home RV" and I had to laugh so hard. Do you know in which video he placed all the minions? 




 Genny's laugh is best laugh. I've seen a lot of fragments in this thread but I cry tears of laughter whenever it's one where Genny loses it. 




 I like how it says "invalid side" after that lol! 




 Oh my. Tears :') 




 He should do a Zisteau level prank on Bdubs. Also, I just realised how many minions there are actually around the server. [Look at it!](http://i.gyazo.com/ff23809f8bed055e417099779dac50e7.png) 




 You have just totally brightened up my day! This is gold hahahaha!! 




 Maybe Genny's Stuff it? I remember them telling they would do that sometime. Or did I miss that? 




 Yeah I'm somewhere in the names part too :D It's a really nice surprise from /u/Guardax! 




 Minecraft with Generikb for sure :) 




 There were so many names I didn't know, lol 




 It's funny to see how everyone with a rare flair suddenly speaks. :D 




 That episode from Bdubs was hilarious. :D I had to laugh just as much as when he did the redstone on of the towers in the adventure branch from Diversity 2. 




 I believe Sev has pranked Aurey not long ago with the hamburger bun on top of the farm in Farmland. I don't know when that was exactly but it doesn't feel like it was too long ago.

Edit: yup his last Mindcrack video was from the 23rd of September. Prank video was from the 10th of September. 




 I like how you fit in in the chart how everyone's health changed over time. Sev's bar is quite impressive if you see it like this. He got low on health pretty quickly but still laste quite some time. 




 Ah, alright. Maybe you could use these quests and modify them to make them more complicate. Or you could just request end-game items from some mods in your pack. 




 Yes but they're not easy when you are on a skyblock. I think that's the difference between AS and what you're gonna do. 




 Yeah I saw those posts too. The Naga in the Nether was the strangest. 




 You could also maybe make a compilation of just the last year, so you don't have the same clips over and over again. A lot of funny moments have happened this year. 




 Yup. I think that was one of the reasons why they needed like 4 or 5 episodes for the adventure branch, where Guude and Chad will probably need 2, including this one. 




 Oh boy.. 




 Even your dirt house is preeeeettyyyyyy :3 




 The video is not even one minute in and then there's Chad's cat.. Oh my. 




 IIRC from the B-team's playthrough (or Jsano/Baj's perspective) it wasn't really anything special, water bottles or something. 




 I think the major drop after the first episode might be because the server restart was just as hyped about as with UHCs. Everyone was excited for the new season and when it turned out they would be using a world border, there were more people than just those few Mindcrackers who disagreed with it. I guess they stopped watching immediately.

edit: whoops I don't know why I already submitted. Secondly, the server reset was during the holidays. On the one hand, no one is going to college so everyone has time to watch, but on the other hand, people are leaving town for multiple weeks, etcetera. I've been away for only a week, I went to Dublin, but I missed a week's content and I never managed to catch up. I felt like I should because I didn't wanna miss anything in that early stage of the new server, but I never did.. That might be the reason why I stopped watching (I only watch one when I'm really bored, I should definitely watch more often) and maybe this is the same for others..

And now people are back in college, having less time to watch. All I hope is that it's not the end of that server already. There are still people active but they upload a Mindcrack video each two days. I expect videos from at least Bdubs and Doc today, possibly Anderz and Vechs as well :) 




 Yeah, like /u/Flawzorge said, he's not active here anymore. Try to tweet him or something. Besides that, I like your intro though ;-) 









 I could see the chest was a trapped chest but the skeleton that spawned still scared me, lol 




 Is that something unique to sevadus? 




 Why sevadus? 




 I did not know you already watched the episode, your comment didn't tell me. I just wanted to explain :) 




 You have to download the map. It's in the map section of the FTB launcher. 




 [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJJsaAcgKNg), it's about Bdubs' episode from last night 




 I have no idea why this gets downvoted. I know he's in university again, it's just that there might be a vlog coming soon because he's at Firstlook for the weekend. 




 Today he's at Firstlook, the biggest gaming event in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, maybe another vlog soon :) 




 Yeah I moved and I was really late with getting a new internet + television provider.  




 [My stream just buffered, lol!](http://i.gyazo.com/ef326141e77c06742cf201cfcc85bf86.png) 




 I feel you. Had a few weeks without internet, I ended up staying at the university until it was time to get home for dinner. 




 /u/RedstoneSlime I think this is better than /r/computercraft because 480 subscribers vs 20K subscribers. There's far more people over at /r/feedthebeast who all would like to help you out. 




 I think tricking someone with someone else's wool is just smart. It makes people think about whether or not they should trust them, especially when that person just killed someone else. They should realize that they have multiple colors of wool on them, or they should first show a color or something like that. Or there should be some sort of a plugin that removes additional wool from someone's inventory, to prevent this. 




 Yeah, of course a head would be better (as in cheaper) than 2 apples. I also understand it leads to a bit more PVP in order to obtain a head, which I don't think is really necessary, there's already enough PVP. Things don't have to go quicker. I'd rather see a team getting all geared up (iron/diamond armor, diamond sword, bow, maybe potions) than rushing into battle without being fully geared.

Maybe I wasn't clear enough. The heads are a good solution if you get low on health really quickly, like in a fight or just bad luck (like Sevadus this last season, lot of mobs around him), don't get me wrong there, but I don't think you really need it if you're well prepared or at almost full health. Which counts for almost everyone most of the time. Besides this, the golden apple works fine anyway. It's just the kill that adds another way of regenerating health, making it easier to do so. Especially near the end of a season, when there's more PVP and there's a few people left, wandering around with gear from a few other teams, it would only stretch out the last bits. They're all at full health again, very easily, and it's just "a normal PVP battle", nothing exciting to it because someone's not at full health anymore. I think it takes away a little bit of the challenge in UHC to regenerate health and to show the difference in skill. That's how I see it. 




 I actually think that's too much.. That's almost half of your total health, would make it way too easy. I assume players would drop their heads? That means that with one apple, a bit of gold and a kill, you'd be able to get quite a lot of health back. I don't like it. It's also pointless to use one when you're not even four hearts down. That's how I see it. 




 Could you explain a bit more? 




 Generikb has his computer specs and everything in every video description so you don't even have to search for his unboxing video. 




 Sorry bot :) 




 I think the Adventurer's backpack holds nothing by default until you change the forestry config file. ([Source](http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Adventurer's_Backpack)) But it might hold things you'd normally find in the world, like flowers, maybe types of wood/saplings? Don't really remember but I only used the Apiarist's backpack :P 




 Not much besides half of the UHC. 




 It's the top comment and the link was submitted right after this post. (Sorry I'm only 4 hours later lol) 




 Thanks! Voted again :) 









 It's nice to see he's getting better every time :D The average points per episode sure has increased a lot. 




 I did! And I will again in a few hours. School first :) 




 But why so late Baj?! :( 









 I started Material Energy^3 a few days ago and I really like it. However, I have two questions.

1. I updated yesterday from 1.4.1 to 1.4.4. This update contained a lot of new quests, but I can't seem to complete them. For example the clay quest in the first chapter. I scanned the whole pond for clay, even dug under all the sand, dirt and gravel, but I couldn't find any more than 32 clay while I need 100. Also, the next quest says there's some sort of AE room under the clay. This was all dirt and stuff for me. Is there a way to "update" the spatial areas so I can complete the quests instead of /hqm edit them? I just finished the first chapter of the quest book before I updated so I'm not that far ahead in the game. If it's necessary, a restart wouldn't be a big problem, but I'd prefer not to.

2. This question is somewhat stupid maybe, but I feel like I'm missing a lot of loot and Easter Eggs on this map. Am I supposed to literally investigate every single area? Break through walls and floors etcetera? I accidentally broke a few blocks yesterday and there was a chest, so I guess there's a lot more of these chests hidden around each spatial area.. Am I supposed to just tear everything apart? Or is there a logical way to reach these chests? 




 I started a vanilla server a few weeks ago and I'm having a lot of fun with it, even though I've played modded minecraft for most of the time. It's funny how you can fill your whole minecraft day with harvesting all your crops or shear all your sheep. However I am looking for some fun or odd goals to complete. For example, obtain a stack of poisonous potatoes. I have 7 already :D Anyone have more of these fun goals to do besides the things I'm already working on? 









 Me and some friends are starting a new server soon and like previous times, we wanna build a custom modpack. This time we're less focused on tech mods and more focused on magic mods like Thaumcraft, Blood Magic, Ars Magica and Witchery. We're also looking for a bit of a challenge, or rather adventure, so we'll probably add some dungeon mods and a few mods that add more (difficulty to) mobs.

Our question now is if anyone knows of any mods that are more tier-based. Most of the tech mods around these days make Minecraft a lot easier and once you've set up a few machines, you're already good to go. We don't want this anymore.

Also, we're looking for a mod that adds maybe a few food items. Not as much as Pam's Harvestcraft. Does anyone have any suggestions for this?


Edit: I forgot to mention we're trying to build a 1.7.10 modpack

Thanks a bunch. 




 Result: 1-0 by Stefan Nijland 




 Can somebody make a team Hatfilms flair? :) 














 Seed: 2735126617611667291

You spawn on [an island](http://gyazo.com/e96824ac3f3a3576edc18927d2da12dd) with a small patch of grass. In the distance (I have render distance at maximum though) you see [another island](http://gyazo.com/7a036c84ae96b9a6288709bf4d7bebef) with a few oak trees on it. It's just over 200 blocks to the south. Furthermore, there are two ocean temples nearby. One is close to the spawn island at X -300, Z +170. The other is close to the second island at X -470 and Z +615.

I think this can serve as a great survival map. You start with some trees and your island. You can cave down (be careful with the water) and you might spot more bits of land on your way. I have not seen a single bit of continent, only very small islands. There might also be more ocean dungeons, I don't know. 




 Title says it all. Research table is empty but I can't scan items to get my research points back because my Thaumometer says I already scanned it! I had a lot of aspects for all of them. I went crazy scanning everything on my items, even everything in my chests and ME network. I don't have anything to scan for new research points.

I am telling this because I'm curious if I'm the only one, and if someone knows what could have caused this to happen. Thaumcraft is not updated between AS 2.1.9 and AS 3.0.1. For now I gave myself 400 of each primal aspect but if this happens to more people, I think someone should look into it. I have never seen this before. I know I can go and find tons of nodes for a good amount of primal aspects and combine my way back up again, but that's not what I want. 




 I have no idea how I can get myself some sulfur very easily. I know there's a Nether ore but I have no intentions to enter the Nether at all. I don't have the resources and power to set up the laser drill (planning to do so, gonna set up an animal farm with a slaughterhouse anywhere these days) so yeah, no Nether ores for me now. I've been pulverizing a lot of coal which has a 10% chance of sulfur but I'm getting low on coal and I got pulverized coal everywhere.

Is it worth it to set up a blaze farm in the meantime and then pulverize some of the blaze rods every now and then? I really need the sulfur for yellorium dust for my big reactor. I managed to get enough stuff to finish the reactor but I can barely fill it with yellorium... As soon as I can, I'm also one step closer to the laser drill. 




 So I am playing the Ag Skies map like many of us and I set up my MFR soy bean farm yesterday. It's quite big because I can replace a lot of ingredients in the Hell's Kitchen quests with tofu or soy milk etcetera. Just wanna keep this running.

I've run into one minor problem though. Or not even a problem, but it's getting annoying. The farm is 100% soy beans but every now and then there are asparagus seeds lying around on the floor around the farm. It's free asparagus seeds, but where are they coming from? Does it have something to do with the ore dictionary? It's only asparagus seeds, very strange...
