 Here is the back story you need to understand: My grandmother didn't raise any of her kids. The relationship she had with her children is like the relationships royalty had with their offspring. After giving birth, she pretty much only them at meals. My grandpa and great-grandma raised my mom, aunt, and uncle. 

My sister is engaged, and grandma asked, "When are you having kids?"

Sister answered, "Probably never. But if we do, it'll be years from now."

Grandma looks bewildered. "No kids? But why?"

"I don't like them."

"Well, I would raise them for you."

At this point my mom starts laughing so hard she nearly drops some dishes. "Mom, you didn't even raise me, you know nothing about babies."

"That isn't so! I raised you kids."

"No you didn't. Grandma got us ready for school every morning. I remember dad taking care of us during the night. You laid in bed every day until noon and then went shopping."

(Here's the kicker.) "Well, I gave you a bottle once."

I gave you a bottle once. *Really.*

Grandma is still trying to convince my sister she'll raise her baby for her.

I'm still not sure how Tumblr works, so in case what's in that link changes here is another pic:http://i50.tinypic.com/243iwqs.jpg

Okay:

Sleeping Beauty: It's annoying when people act like some random prince just raped Aurora. That might have been what happened in the original tale, but not in the Disney movie. In the movie, Aurora and Philip fell in love on their own. They met out in the woods and sang together. Aurora eventually stuck her finger on the spinning wheel, and went to a magically induced sleep until Philip could kill the villain, and kiss her to wake her up. It wasn't as if Phillip came across a sleeping woman and decided to rape her here. They were already in love and he just had to kiss her to wake her up. In what way is that anything like rape? If you want to bitch about the original tale go ahead, but that's not what the Disney version did.

Snow White: I've always felt that the true heroes were the drawfs, not the prince. The drawfs opened their home to SW and cared about her. They didn't make her cook and clean for them; she chose to. There was a homeless child wandering around the forest, and they adopted her. The prince just kind of happened among them and decided to kiss a corpse. He didn't protect her in any way.

Ariel: Ariel didn't change her body and leave her family for Eric. She did that because she wanted to be human. She wouldn't have met Prince Eric at all if she hadn't been going to the surface to spy on humans. 

Jasmin: Well, this is true for the time Jasmin was written to exist in. But in the end she chose to marry Aladdin, who was worth nothing politically. And her choice was accepted and supported. What's to bitch about here?

Belle: I'm confused here. Is this saying appearances don't matter to the guy as long as the girl is pretty? Belle's appearance isn't what made the Beast fall for her. It was because she was smart (all that reading she did) and wanted to help him. In the deleted scenes it even shows Bell teaching the Beast to read. That's why he liked her. 

Cinderella: Or maybe if you keep your chin up, try your best, and believe in yourself even in bad situations, good things can happen and you'll be rewarded? 




 Men:

Circumcision - Can we please give baby boys the same rights girls have and stop mutilating them?

Child Support - I have no problem with it generally, but it's just wrong that sex can lead to a man being stuck shelling out money for 18 years. If a woman is told from the get-go she'll be a single mother, she accepts full responsibility if she decides to keep the child. She can still abort (which I also think should be legal in all 50 states and cheap as part of healthcare), or put it up for adoption, so it isn't like she has to be a single mother if she doesn't want to. Obviously I don't think a man should be able to leave a heavily pregnant woman after they've decided to have a child, or a child he already has, but it's wrong that a woman can just say, "Yep, I'm one month pregnant, so get a job because you're on the hook for 18 years." *She has choices available to her, so should he.* I know poverty is also an issue, but I would also have a minimum wage you can live on, like Sweden does.

-The draft. Mens' lives aren't worth less than a woman's. I believe the draft should be done away with entirely, but both sexes should have to register as long as it exists.

Women:

Abortion legal - That's it. Her body, her choice. She gets the only say.

Military - Standards should be the same for men and women if they are doing the same work. All roles, even combat, should be open for women if they meet the requirements.
 




 I don't have dental insurance and can't afford it, so I'm looking into getting my teeth looked at by dental schools as I hear it's cheaper. How much cheaper is it? My teeth need so much dental attention but I'd settle for just having cavities taken care of, will they do that?  




 If you've ever had a retail or any sort of sales job, you know the drill. You're expected to smile, be energetic, and make customers feel welcome. Yeah, not very easy for someone whose life involves mostly misery. I can't even count how many times I've been called into the managers' office because someone complained that I didn't smile (yes, people have actually complained because I didn't smile at them), or because I wasn't friendly.

Now, I am never rude. I am polite, always give customers my full attention, and try to help them in whatever way I can. But I simply cannot act enthusiastic enough to satisfy managers. That's why my job interviews often lead nowhere. Smile? You have no idea how much energy it takes not to cry sometimes, smiling is quite out of the question. And I can't act enthusiastic because I can't remember the last time I was excited. I have my good days and bad days, but my two main moods are depressed and neutral. If I'm neutral, it means I'm having a good day.  









 http://mybrownbaby.com/2011/12/taye-diggs-says-fatherhood-is-a-little-scary%E2%80%94but-easy-and-romantic/

I know this article is over a year old, but it made me chuckle. I'm a huge Broadway fan, and a fan of Idina Menzel, Taye's wife, so I watched some interviews with them after the baby was born. They mentioned having a nanny, a cook, and at one point, a driver.

No, I imagine parenting wouldn't be at all difficult with all that. But the scary thing is, when this article first came out, on Broadway forums were saying, "See, parenting isn't that hard, you just have to love each other!" I hope they won't think their baby comes with three people for help too. :X 




 I was put on 10mg of Paxil at age 11, maybe 10 at the youngest. At around 17 I was put on 20mg, and in my 20s (I'm 24 now) I was put on 40mg. I've been feeling like my medicine isn't doing as much as it used to, and have been since I was 17. The doc thought it would help to keep increasing the dose, but finally I said I don't think increasing the dose would help a lot. So she switched me to 20mg (to start) Prozac, and told me to go down to half a dose of Paxil for a week, stop taking it, then switch to Prozac.

Well, Monday (the 4th) was my last Paxil day, and I feel like complete shit now. Headaches, those electrical shocks in my head (I'm sure you know what I'm talking about), the nausea, the back aches, the dizziness...just ugh. It totally feels like the flu. I'm sweating enough to fill a swimming pool. I've always been an easy crier, but now I can cry just on command. I go back to the doc in April, I just hope it's better by then. 

Also, yes, I'm aware a week is a very short time for Paxil to be weaned off of. But it's been 5 days, I may as well ride it out, since it wasn't doing much for me anymore anyway. On the bright side, at least I haven't found a job yet. Working like this? No.

And finally, old suicide wishes are spring back up, but I don't have to worry about that since I would feel really bad for my grandma if I did, so I'm putting it off until she dies, at least. I've been dealing with it for more than a decade, it's just a little stronger now. 




 You have to agree it takes a special someone to make it through something so rigorous as medical school. Not only is the subject of your learning difficult, med schools tend to test your stamina by making you go on little sleep and outrageous hours. For years. 

Now look at me. I failed out of school (not med school, but still) and I don't feel comfortable complaining about my inadequacies  to someone who's basically a god compared to me. I can barely keep it together to hold down a job, let alone do anything that takes skill and intelligence. I just feel like they'd be right to look down upon me, although I know they wouldn't. 




 I know this article is a few years old, but I haven't seen it mentioned here before, so...

http://thestir.cafemom.com/healthy_living/8143/_Baby_Lust_Would_You

There's an alarmingly high statistic floating around CafeMom of late:
Forty-two percent of women claim they would lie about contraception in order to get pregnant, regardless of the wishes of their partners. In other words, women so desperately want a baby that they tell their partners are on birth control when, really, they aren't.

Honestly, this sort of shit should get men off child support responsibilities if it's found out. I already sort of support "financial abortions" for men (of course, some things would need considered, such as cost of abortions for women, access to healthcare, etc), but how can anyone find this shit acceptable?  









 So many people say you can't compare female circ to male circ because of these things:

-Female circumcision removes the clitoris, which would be like removing the entire penis in a male

-Female circ is only performed to diminish sexual stimulation in the female

-Female circ is done in dirty conditions with pieces of class, inviting infection and death

-Female circ ruins lives

I don't deny all this is true in certain parts of the world, like a lot of countries in Africa. But too many people are unaware of other types of female circumcision, which can very easily be compared to male:

-In places like much of Egypt and Indonesia, the clitoris isn't removed. Only the clitoral hood is removed. This is very similar to removing the foreskin in the male. The development of both types of prepuce is the same. Both uncover the glans during sexual stimulation, both are fused to the glans at birth, and both collect smegma. 

-This type isn't done to diminish sexuality. It's done because they believe it to be cleaner, healthier, and more visually appealing. 

-This type is very rarely done in huts with pieces of glass. Doctors in hospitals do it with sterile equipment.

-Women who have had this type done to them seem happy with it. Let me post two links:

http://aandes.blogspot.com/2010/04/circumcision.html

This one is a blog written by an Indonesian woman. In the blog, she talks about taking her daughter to the hospital and having her circumcised. She says her daughter never cried, and she herself had it done as a baby. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcJNAtn-c6Ifeature=youtu.be

This second link is about circumcision in Egypt, mostly of women. The women interviewed said they enjoy their circumcised bodies, will have it done to their daughters, and they go on to describe how safe it is since it's done by a doctor, how much healthier it is, and how much cleaner it is. 

Now, for the record, I believe even this form of female circumcision should be illegal. It's body modification on a child. But what's striking how similar it is to how we view male circumcision in America. 









 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaqFHT8oOBo

Here's part of Nanny 911 - see if you can even get through 10 seconds of it!

This just astounds me. If my sister and I had acted like that I'm sure my dad would have killed one of us. And I always cringe when I see kids hitting their parents. I went through a hitting phase as a child, but I never hit an adult. I knew my dad would have had my hide. 




 They have to put emotion into everything.

For example, the word victim. It means you were the hurt or oppressed subject of a crime or other malicious activity. It's just a term. Recently I was told I'm not allowed to say rape victim anymore. I have to say target. Not sexual assault victim, it has to be sexual assault target. 

But WTF's wrong with victim? It just means you were taken advantage of. And you were. Nothing is shameful about it, it's just a term. Soon they're going to decide target implies the person wasn't human, or something. 

Some others:
Dumb (it used to mean you couldn't talk, so it's offensive to people who can't talk)
Retard (Can't even use it in its correct context now. Retard just means to slow down. You can't say "One pedal makes the car speed up, the other retards it)
Broad (Yep, I had someone tell me it's offensive even if you mean wide or big, since it's also an offensive term for women)

How about we make these people so afraid of every English word they just stop talking?

EDIT: Can't believe I forgot to add my favorite one! Butthurt. A SRSer told me it's offensive to rape victims(targets?) because it implies rape. I said, "I always thought it meant you fall down and hurt your butt like a whiny little kid." They answered, "Well, some people say it means rape so you shouldn't use it." So now you can't say things because other people MIGHT think it means something else. 









 I didn't feel good one day, and decided it must be my empty stomach, so I ate some shredded beef jerky. I guess I was actually sick because I threw it up 15 mins later. It was oddly foamy and tasted so sour. I didn't eat beef jerky again for about a year.

What's your experience? 




 I live next to a family that is fucking huge. Two parents and three kids, all of them really large people. The oldest is probably 19 or 20, the next kid is 17 or so and the youngest is about 12. 

I was about 11 when the youngest kid was born, and I remember her being a normal sized baby. Maybe on the large side, but nothing crazy. As the months passed, I noticed the baby getting way too big to be healthy. My parents said the same thing, but with her family being huge, what else was there to expect? By the time she was 4 years old she was too heavy to lift. This trend continued. 

I remember the youngest (let's call her Sara) was always complaining that her legs hurt. Her mom said, "Everyone's legs hurt, you'll get used to it." This family is very "being-fat-isn't-unhealthy" despite the fact that the father and the oldest daughter are both diabetics because of their weight and the middle girl has breathing problems, also weight related. We live out in the country and there is quite a walk between our houses. I played with them when I was younger and I remember having to stop inbetween houses to they could catch their breath. 

Well, a little bit ago their mother called my mother on the phone, upset, and told her this: Sara had fallen and broken one of her knees a few weeks ago. It was a slight fall, but her weight and the stress on it over the years broke the knee pretty easily. The doctor said she needed to stay off it at all costs. He didn't even want her walking on crutches because the recovery was going to be so slow and fickle. Her mom asked why she couldn't just use crutches, and he said frankly, it was her weight. She was too big to walk around on one leg without risking injury to it, and it was also too risky for her broken knee because of the stress put on it. 

Well, they couldn't accept the news from the doctor that weight was actually having a negative impact on their daughter. When Sara got home they didn't take his warning seriously. They didn't believe weight would hurt her injury further, so they got her crutches and let her walk around.

Guess what's happened now? Sara started complaining of extreme pain in her knee. It was so bad one night they took her to the ER. Diagnosis? Bone death. Probably caused by the break not being allowed to rest and having to continuously bear a lot of weight. They're going to have to replace her entire knee. 

Honestly, I believe child services should be called in these cases. You'll get your kids taken away if they're dangerously skinny, so why is being dangerously overweight okay?  




 SIDS - sudden infant death syndrome - is what they call it when an infant dies and there is no explanation. It's probably caused by babies falling into a deep sleep and not breathing. Despite many ways to lower the risk, thousands of babies still die from it every year in the USA alone. 

What kind of shit is this?! Knowing me, if I had an infant I would be driven literally insane from the worry. At least I don't feel the need to check to see if my cat is breathing every 5 minutes. 




 I really don't mean for this to be a pro-suicide message. I was just wondering if anyone else ever felt this way. Most people see what they think as their eventual suicide in a negative light, but I've seen it positively for years, and want to know your thoughts.

In my view, my life is a trap. Doing a job I hate to support a life I don't want for years and years. I'm only 23, but I think my middle aged years would just be more of the same. The same old depression, sadness, and annoyance continuing for years and years until I finally die of old age. Well, knowing suicide is there helps me, sort of. I know I don't have to live that life if I don't want. I only have to live it as long as I can stand it then finally check out.

Again, I don't mean for this to be pro-suicide or anything of the sort. I've just never met anyone else with these same feelings and wonder if anyone is out there.

I know you can't expect a toddler to behave, really. They can barely understand what you're saying and they tire easily. But this kid sounds miserable to be around, and the mother is at fault, IMO. 

And they go to the zoo once a week? WTF? I rarely got to go to the zoo. 

And she's proudly vaccine free? I wish I could send these idiots to the past so they can see the terrible things the diseases we don't have now because of vaccines did to people. 














 -Clothes. I will never spend more than $8 on a pair of pants or shirt. Goodwill has a lot of nice stuff for very cheap. It boggles my mind why people spend hundreds of dollars on clothes.

-DVDs. I can understand picking up a cheap copy of a movie somewhere, but do people still really buy $20 DVDs? Even with piracy easily achieved?

-Baby stuff. Again, Goodwill is great for this. I've never seen anything that looked dirty or heavily used in the baby section. I also saw a good crib for $20. A stroller that looked like it just came out of the box for $20. Even some clothes with the pricetags still on them originally costing $15 or $20. Goodwill's price? $2.50. If I ever have a baby, the nursery is going to be made up from Goodwill shit for under $100. 

-Most things in a pet store. If you're getting a special item I can understand it, but why would you buy basic supplies at a pet store? You can get the same exact objects at Walmart for a third of the price. I got my rats a water bottle for $1.50 at Walmart. The exact same bottle was $4.50 at Petco.

-Books. Textbooks not included, since there is really no way around that. I can't believe people buy books at Barnes and Nobles at those prices. I buy my books online (in great shape, too, some even brand new) for half those prices, even if you include shipping. 









 http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16xipk/moms_of_reddit_whats_something_about_pregnancy/

I do want to have a baby someday despite this horror, but I swear a gagged a few times reading this.  




 According to SRS's idea of privilege, the only people who can openly speak about anything without being invalidated by their race/sex/sexual orientation/etc are black transsexual gay women who are disabled. So these people are the lucky ones. They can say whatever they want without being told to check their privilege and shut down. 

So whenever they begin talking, tell them to check their privilege privilege. 









 I mention tearing up at the lyric change "a man who only learned to love when you were in his keeping" during the finale, and my cousin scoffed at me. "But you don't like kids."

So that means I wouldn't see the importance of a man who hasn't seen any sort of love in 25 years adopting an abused child and finally finding some purpose in his life. 



















 I'm not bothered by women who nurse in public as long as they don't make a spectacle of it, but I am annoyed at the "Look at my exposed tit while I suckle my child, aren't I a goddess!" women. Breastfeeding isn't that amazing. All mammals do it, and you aren't mother nature. I'm glad you've chose to nurse since it's the best an infant can eat, but someone isn't being unreasonable if they ask you to cover up a little in a restaurant.

I don't mind nursing done discreetly, but you don't need to have your entire boob out while you glare at strangers silently daring them to say something. 




 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2250785/I-locked-toddler-room-night-save-marriage.html

Really, the parenting problem began long before this. Why did the boy think it was okay to get up after his parents put him to bed? Even before I started kindergarten, I knew once I was put to bed, I wasn't allowed up unless I was going to the bathroom or getting a drink of water. And if I was doing that, it'd better be fast. And pounding on the door? I didn't dare pound on the door after being put in my room, I would have had my butt beaten. 









 I've worked three jobs so far. The first two in food service, and the current one in retail. I always hear about how rude and entitled teenagers are, but I've noticed the exact opposite. I'm actually happier to serve teenagers. They're a lot more patient, forgiving of mistakes, and treat me like a human being.

My least favorite customers are the elderly. They get mad at me if computers are slow, roll their eyes if I ask for ID, and I've even had a few flat out walk away while I was talking to them. 














 JROTC is a program the military has in high schools to teach about the military and promote signing up after high school.  4 days of the week is learning about the history and how the military is run, and one day is uniform day. Students are given a military uniform and graded according to how correctly they wear it. 

Well, my cousin in ROTC told me that in October, instead if your uniform shirt you could wear one of those pink breast cancer awareness shirts and it counted as part of your uniform. Nothing wrong with that. But in November, male students wanted to be allowed to grow their beards for a month as part of Movember, the movement to gain awareness for male specific cancers. They were told no, that a beard isn't part of the uniform. Well, neither are pink shirts, but that was allowed. 

But for some fun, let's answer how SRS would when told about this problem: BEARDS! YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT BEARDS WHEN 100% OF WOMEN IN THE MILITARY ARE RAPED EVERY DAY! *insert dildos and poop here* God, when will men learn no one cares about their beards when women are so oppressed that they're considered too weak to be in the military at all! Ever think of that? They probably just want to wear beards to scare the women who were raped by men with beards! 




 For one, I have severe depression and anxiety and it's a chore to talk to people for me. Not good for a retail worker, but who really works retail because they enjoy it? I have a running habit of getting complained on at work. The usual comments are "didn't smile" "didn't look at me" "didn't greet or thank me." I got two in the past two days. Now, I can be a bitch, yes, but not at work. *Hell, I don't speak back or even react to customers who are rude to me.* I just continue doing my thing. Right now I work behind a counter, and my comments are usually, "Hello. It comes to a total of $_______. Swipe your card here. Here's your things. Take care." And the best part is, these past two days I wasn't even in a bad mood. I was just kind of like: Yeah, another day, what's up? Even the bagboy behind me said he didn't notice me being rude. 

One problem I think is that I don't smile very much. It's just never been something I've done. It doesn't feel natural and plus, I have weak teeth and don't like to show them.  




 Just a vent about how pointless my existence is.

I started going to nursing school in 2010. Luckily for me, my parents paid for it. Paid for the classes, my books, the gas to get there, everything. But less than 9 months later I had to drop out. It was because I was beginning to fail some classes (no matter how hard I tried, I could not get my test scores above 76%, and they were always frustratingly close, like 74), and the teacher said if I ever tried to enter any other nursing school with a record of failing out, they'd be less likely to take me, so it's better to have a "chose to drop it" on the record. 

For the past two years I've been feeling pretty guilty about wasting my parents' money. I put my school books under the bed because I can't stand to look at them. What's more, I want to go back to college (not for nursing, don't want to go through that hell again), but knowing I'll probably fail and throw $10K down the tubes again, and this time be weighted down by student debt. And who's to say going to college will even lead to a job? It doesn't for so many people.

My situation is a *little* better than it was when I was last here. Instead of making $7.70 at Wendys I'm making $8 an hour in retail. I don't enjoy it, but it's certainly better than Wendys was. At least I don't spend my off time fantasizing about dying as much as I did there. 

I was diagnosed with depression at age 11 and have been on Paxil since then; I'm 23 now. I feel like one of those people who will never really be an adult, since I haven't been able to move out and still live at home. And I feel like an ungrateful bitch for failing out of college by parents paid for, although it's been 2 years and I feel as bad for it as I did when it happened. 




 I'm 23 years old, and want a baby so bad I could cry. But I know I have no business with one since I have a crappy job and live with my parents. Still, I hope someday in the future that may chance and I will be able to be a mother. 

Despite this, I support childfree people strongly. For one, children deserve a loving family, and they may not get that if they have parents who don't really want them. It's so stupid to pressure people into having children who don't want them. It's 18+ years that will be spent mainly on taking care of another person. Besides being expensive as fuck, we're talking about a child here. They need so much love and attention. 

Another thing is overpopulation. There are 7 billion people on this planet, and growing daily. There is no need for people to breed like bunnies. Not really part of this topic, but I feel it's appropriate here, I think adopting should be easier. No, children shouldn't be given to just anybody, but it shouldn't cost $60K to adopt a kid, and we shouldn't be turning down wonderful potential adoptive parents because they were caught with a joint 10 years ago. 

My last point: As someone who has worked crappy service jobs my whole life so far, I've some terrible kids that have made me almost reconsider wanting a kid someday. I've seen kids spit on, hit, and bite their parents and face no punishment, I've seen kids make hugh messes employees with have to clean up and their parents don't bat an eye. Now I work at an expensive store that sells exotic decorations, and parents even let their kids climb onto the shelves and knock items down that probably cost more than I make in a week. And the managers let them do it because they don't want to make customers feel like they can't come back. If I were in charge, I'd make parents pay for everything their kids ruined, AND ban them from the store. 









 Here are a few pics of my goats:

That's all I have by way of proof. I could send a mod my Facebook profile, which has more pics of goats in our yard, if you want. 














 I'm talking about suicide, of course. My mom says that  phrase all the damn time, and I just want to say, "Or it could be a permanent solution to a problem that never goes away and eats at you until you have to do something to end it." 

They act like suicide is something people decide to do when they're behind on a couple bills, when they have a flat tire, when they're currently working a job they don't like. They don't understand that people choose this because they can't take the never-ending sadness and loneliness anymore. I know people do it for different reasons, but no one has decided, "Well, I loved life before, but I got this F on my report card, so I guess I'm checking out."

I'm just venting. We heard tonight that someone who lives nearby shot himself because his business was going under. It aggravated me that people ignored the other possible issues he may have been having and think he killed himself because he'd had to close his hardware store. 




 I don't see my life going anywhere. I still live at home, and Wendys is the best job I can get. Failing out of nursing school only made me realize how stupid I am and that I'm unlikely to ever progress beyond Wendys. I wasted thousands of dollars on nursing so I'm afraid to try to go back to college and waste even more money. And even if I did manage to get some degree, so what? People with degrees are working fast food jobs too. I'm exactly where they are now, except I'm not in terrible debt. 

I know your 20s are confusing and you often bounce from job to job until you find one you're fit for, but I have co-workers in their 30s, 40s, and even 50s. I refuse to let that happen to me. How is that sort of life worth it? I don't want to leave my loved ones, but I cannot stand the thought of working at a minimum wage job my whole life, more miserable than ever, just to scrape by. 

I'm only 23, so I guess anything could happen, but I doubt it. I just don't see the point of living a life with little happiness on the off chance something might get better. Oddly enough, knowing I won't be doing this into my middle age years is comforting, whether it's because I found something else or because I'm dead. Frankly, I'd rather be dead.

I've been on Paxil since I was 11 (I wanted to kill myself even back then), and it seemed to work in my early teen years, but even the higher dosages my doc put me on only takes the edge off. I guess we could try other medicines or other dosages, but what's the point? I would just be more miserable than I am now between now and the time we found the right medicine and dose, which could take who knows how long. 

I just felt like venting tonight instead of just keeping it to myself. Thanks for reading. 




 Mine was a cystoscopy. I'm female. I have frequent unexplained UTIs that are still a mystery, but last year the doc sent me to a specialist for this. They pretty much stick [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cystoscope-med-20050425.jpg) into your urethra and into your bladder. It's got a camera on it so they can see what's going on.

They did this with some lube, and that's it. No pain medication. The insertion was...something terrible. It hurt less once it was into the bladder, but it still hurt a lot and feeling it move around was just adding to the discomfort. Removal was another horror and peeing afterwards felt like I was pissing lava. 

And yes, it's normal to not receive any anesthetics for this.

What are yours? I'm waiting to read! 














 For some reason, I can't stand to take a bath in narrow or small bathtubs. Something about sitting in one with my knees touching the sides just makes me shudder. I also can't stand the thought of laying in one without water. Even seeing other people do it makes me cringe. 

I also can't take a bath with no bubble bath. Something about seeing the bottom of the tub while I'm in it bothers me. 




 I work at Wendys, and we're not supposed to void anything. That means if someone orders a single, and I enter it into the computer then they decide they don't want it, I have to void it, and this is one count against me. If my void percentage is up to a certain amount, I get written up. WTF? First of all, most voids aren't my fault. "I want a cheeseburger deluxe with extra pickles. Then a water. You know what, scratch the burger. I want a chicken sandwich." Ugh! Then the manager looks at the voids at the end of the day and says, "You lost us $25." How does this lose any money if the line hasn't even begun making the sandwich yet? Why do restaurants do this?  




 I'll start. My cousin told this joke:

Martha asked her mom, "Mommy, can I go outside and play with the boys?"
"No, darling, they're too rough."
Martha thought for a moment, and asked, "If I find a smooth one, can I play with him?"

My mom's friend thought it had something to do with pubic hair and said child abuse jokes weren't funny. 




 I work at Wendys. It was during lunch rush, and I owed someone $0.42 in change. I got out the $0.40, and started to unwrap a roll of pennies when my boss started yelling at me to be faster. She scolded me in front of the customers, and forgetting I still owed the man $0.02 I gave him his change and called the next customer. The next guy ordered for about 10 seconds when the last customer pops back over and puts the receipt in my face. "Young lady, this says my change is $0.42. You gave me $0.40." I had already closed the register, so we waited for the boss to bring the key so I could open the register again and give him his $0.02. 

Honestly, he cut back in front of a very long line and held us up during lunch rush for $0.02. The next guy in line did not look happy.

Edit: Yes, I noticed the typo in the title. 




 Warning, this pic is a little gory. She's recovered and is totally well now, but we have no idea how she ended up like this. Does it look like a bite? An impalement? The vet couldn't tell.

 I work in fast food, and this happened today.

A pair of young parents brought in 7 kids. The oldest might have been 10, the youngest looked to be only a couple months. While they ordered, they let the children run around and do as they please. Darting under the tables, making a bunch of noise, nearly knocking over other patrons, ect. I noticed while they were ordering they left the infant in a carrier way on the other side of the restaurant by himself. 

I thought this was bad enough, but it was worse when they actually sat down to eat. The parents watched as three of the kids actually climbed up on the neighboring tables and jumped off, again and again. The oldest kid pushed out a chair and stood one of the toddlers in the window, which was about a good 4 feet off the ground. The kid pounded on the window and giggled madly. 

When they left, I had chairs to put back, tables to push back together, handprints to clean off the window, footprints to clean off the tables, not to mention bits of food everywhere and drinks spilled all over the carpet. If I was the manager, I would have told them to leave long before they sat down. 




 This was in 2006. I was 17, and my aunt took me to the mall along with her 2-year-old son. She was going to get her eyebrows waxed, and asked me to keep an eye on Jakey (the kid, obviously) for her. We could go wherever we wanted, and she'd call me on my cell when she was finished. 

Let me just say that I wasn't all that keen on watching Jakey. He was a spoiled brat, and since he never listened to his mom, I doubted he'd listen to me. He threw a tantrum like any toddler when he didn't get his way, but unlike most toddlers, his tantrums mostly got him what he wanted. He'd even been known to call his parents "bitch" and "asshole" without any consequences. But I agreed to take him, and we wandered over to the Disney section. 

Another thing about Jakey, he loved escalators. His parents would ride them up and down with him again and again, and the Disney store was right next to the escalator. I was looking at the princess dresses (I've always been a Disney Princess fan) when Jakey started his "I want to ride the escalator!" fit. It started out as just whining, but he got louder and louder and began stamping his feet. People were looking over, but I was determined that unlike Jakey's parents, I would make him mind me. 

I said, "We'll go up and down the escalator in a minute, but if you keep throwing a fit about it, we won't go at all." He threw himself to the floor, immediately screaming and hitting his fists and legs on the ground. I heard people mutter about teen parents, but I ignored them and tried to pull him up. He climbed away from me and dove under the clothing rack. Of course several shirts fell to the floor and I worked to put them back as quick as I could. I didn't realize I would lose track of Jakey so fast. 

By the time I put the last article of clothing back, I had no idea where my cousin had gotten to. I was beginning to panic. What if I couldn't find him? What would my aunt say? My gaze shifted towards the escalators although I hadn't really thought of looking there. Jakey had been wearing a red shirt, I can remember that very clearly. I saw a woman heading up the escalator carrying a curly brown haired child with a red shirt. 

I instantly sprinted out of the Disney store, shouting for her to stop. I knocked several people out of the way running to the escalator, but the woman thankfully didn't try to run or anything. When I reached her, she put Jakey down and said, "I'm sorry, I just saw a little kid alone on the escalator and was worried he'd get hurt on it. I was going to take him to customer service." I didn't say anything, I just grabbed Jakey's hand and dragged him all the way to the elevators once we reached the top floor. I had decided there was no way in hell I'd let him enjoy another escalator ride after what he'd done. Finally my aunt called, and I got to release Jakey back into her supervision. 

I did tell her about the incident, but she just laughed it off. I don't think she realized how scared I'd been. Also, I'm sure the woman was telling the truth, I was just already so nervous kidnapping was the first thing that popped into my head. I know this isn't as scary as some stories, but it was a couple hours before I felt normal again. 

Oh, and at age 8, Jakey is still a big a brat as ever. 




 My dad and I were watching The Shining when I was about 10, and the part where Wendy sees the guy in the dog suit blowing the old man came on. I asked what they were doing, and dad swore he didn't know.

Oh, and "Fluffy went to the farm" stories don't count, since we've all had those. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/x5y4u/on_obama_why_is_he_considered_a_black_guy_when_he/

First, it's true what the OP said. Obama is as much white as he is black. What's wrong with acknowledging this? It's just a fact. I myself have wondered why everyone says he's black when he's exactly the same amount white. I'd vote for him again regardless of his race, it's just something I've always wondered. They're claiming we're saying Obama's biracial because he *must* have some white in him to be successful! Yeah, sure. 0.o

Also, what's this about defining Obama's race for him? No one gets to decide what race they are. It's genetics. That's not something that is up to interpretation. You're whatever your genetics say.  














 And if you've been raped before, what would you do this time?

I probably wouldn't. I'd want to go to the ER to get tested for disease and such, but bothering with the police would be the last thing I would want to do. In fact, I probably wouldn't tell anyone. 




 (This is my sister's AMA on my account, since she isn't on Reddit)

http://i46.tinypic.com/21mhvn4.jpg

Info: Sat on a draft horse with no saddle or bridle, and fell off. Surgery was performed on Thursday, and she wasn't able to come home until Saturday. Pain meds were making her hallucinate and panic. She had a nerve block done before the operation, which she said was the worst pain she's ever felt, but the docs said it would have been worse without the nerve block. It will be about 6 months before she's able to walk without the help of a wheelchair or walker. Ask away. 




 I know it's been done, but I want to have trouble falling asleep tonight! 









 http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/uhfpx/im_still_waiting_for_reporters_to_follow_women/

The feeling I got from the quote was, "When we realize how creepy it is that men are following women into their locker rooms, maybe we'll also realize that it isn't right to allow the women to make the nude men feel uncomfortable, either." Maybe a little vengeful and sarcastic, but true.

But of course, SRS can't have that! You can't even joke about a woman's locker room and a reporter now, although *women actually are allowed into mens locker rooms.* 




 I am a cashier at Wendys. If you go through the drive-thru:

-Have your money ready. If you went through the screen right to the window, I can see not being ready, but if you waited in line, there is no damn excuse for not having your money out.

-Please understand that we're on a timer. If you take a long time to get to the window or take your time digging for change, I have people on my headset yelling at me because they think I'm holding you up or something. Having exact change or giving me change so you can get an even amount back is fine, but if you must dig through your purse or coin pouch to get it and I'm waiting on you, please just forget it and give me the nearest dollar so we can get you through and my boss will stop yelling at me through the headset.

-Please don't put your money in your mouth or lick your fingers before going through the bills. Would you want to handle money with spit on it?

-Please drive to the second window after you get your change as soon as you can. Again, if you sit there putting your money away, checking your make-up, putting everything back in your purse, my boss is on the headset telling me I'm taking too long.

-Please don't get upset if I don't laugh at your lame jokes or really return your small talk. I've been standing there for hours for minimum wage, or running between the window to the sink to do dishes between orders. I'm wet and miserable, especially if it's cold out and I can't close the window because you're talking. I will not be rude or pushy, but please understand I'm doing a job and my job is to get you through ASAP. If you sit there and try to joke with me, you're holding up the line, getting me into trouble. 

If you get your food at the counter...

-Please speak up! People are talking behind me, in front of me, beside me, and there are also the sounds of cooking and pots and pans hitting surfaces. I can't hear your murmuring and whispering. I'm also partly deaf in one ear, so if I tilt my head towards you, speak into that side of my head.

-Go slowly. Fast food computers are shitty, and I often have to hit the buttons a couple times before your order is entered. While you're going on about your Frosty, I'm still on your burger trying to get your preferences entered in.

-Don't come up to the register without me calling you up. In the afternoons there are no runners, so I have to collect the food and put it on the tray myself before I can take another order. This makes me nervous, and the person waiting for their food is now pushed into the wall. Wait until I call for the next person.

-Be nice! Believe me, I want you to get your food quickly as much as you do so I can move on. If you say, "Excuse me, I think I ordered a large and you rang in a small," and you're polite, I'll probably fix it without charging you the difference. But if you push the other patrons aside and act like a smart ass, you can bet I will charge you the difference.

Any other tips, Redditors? 




 -If they start their post with "going to be buried, but..." It's so annoying. Annoying enough that I downvote your ass.

-Horrible spelling and grammar. I also downvote a comment if they're just replying to correct someone's spelling and grammar. 

-Insulting someone. If you can't convey your thoughts without insulting people, DOWNVOTE! 

However, I never downvote someone just because they offend me or I disagree with them. 









 For those who aren't familiar, the idea is that since a woman can 100% control when she's going to have kids by using condoms, the pill, abortion, etc men should have more options than just condoms. They can break, some men have reactions to the latex or the lube, whatever. A financial abortion would allow a man to tell a pregnant woman early on that he won't be around financially for the child, and she won't be able to go after him for child support. Of course, this would have to be done very early on, when she can still have an elective abortion if she decides. He wouldn't be able to tell his 7-month-along girlfriend that he's skipping town. 

This does present some problems, one being that the child might be living in poverty if the mother keeps it and can't afford it (which no child should have to do). We also have to think about how difficult abortions can be for women. They're expensive, painful, and possibly emotionally wrecking. Also, for some women, abortions can be difficult to get, especially in red states.

I support FA in theory, but we have the above kinks to work out. I just think that if a woman has the total power to never have children even if birth control fails, so should a man. A child is a huge responsibility, and "parenthood by choice, not by chance" should apply to everyone, regardless of sex.  




 Any horror stories at all.

Today, I had someone come through the drive-thru with no pants on. She was a very big woman and I'm pretty sure I saw her labia. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/tijog/13_year_old_girl_dies_and_by_donating_her_organs/

Okay, anyone who donates organs should be admired, but there is some crazy shit going on here. I love how they're claiming it's because the girl is female, when the original comment said nothing at all about the donor's sex. Not to mention all the comments about the doctors being men. How do they know some of the docs weren't women?  









 http://ravallirepublic.com/news/state-and-regional/article_244325fd-723e-5739-9cb1-8f9c10f526bf.html

Come on Missoula, that's pathetic. 




 Some TMI details: I woke up at around 4 AM with severe cramping. I figured it was probably a miscarriage, as I had been experience some light bleeding for the past two days. I was almost 9 weeks in. But I had work that day and since I wasn't able to call in 12 hours ahead, I would need a doctor's excuse. I couldn't afford the copay to see a doctor, so I just decided to go in. It was very painful, but I took a Vicodin I had left over for my wisdom teeth and tried using a pad. The pad was full in about an hour, so I just decided to wear one of my grandpa's leftover Depends. (Yeah, weird, but what else was I going to do?) 

I went in about three hours into my miscarriage. The Vicodin was helping, but it was still in pretty terrible pain. I think everyone knew I wasn't feeling good because they were really helpful, and I think even the costumers knew something was up because I was tipped extremely well. 

The next day my mom lent me the money to see the doctor, and she gave me a doctor's excuse for that day. I was bleeding a lot less, but it was still nice to have a day off to rest. She did confirm it was a miscarriage, and it took a few days to completely pass. 

Not sure how I would prove this, I didn't take a picture of my dead embryo or anything. But when I told my boss what happened when I went into work next, she was pretty shocked I came in in that condition, so maybe others would have questions? 




 http://loop21.com/life/marissa-alexander-stand-your-ground-against-black-people

The article is about the stand your ground law and the controversy surrounding it and Trayvon Martin's murder, but I'm posting it here as a gender issue.

What happened to Marissa here is something we usually attribute to men: She was in an abusive relationship, fired a gun into the ceiling to scare off her husband who she said threatened to kill her and began to charge her, and is now in jail because her husband claimed she tried shooting at him and his children(from another marriage). 

I thought I'd post this because it's another case of the wrong person being arrested in a domestic abuse case, even if it's the woman in this case. I can see having her in custody for awhile since she supposedly fired a gun at someone, but why not her husband too? He has a history of domestic violence, and threatened murder.  




 My cat is 13-14 years old, and I've noticed for months she's been peeing on the carpet. I'm at the end of my rope. I've tried new litter, new litter boxes, even taken her to the vet to see if anything is wrong (nothing is). She uses the box sometimes, but I've seen her pee on the floor with my own eyes. I've tried to clean it up as best I can, but I think the carpet is ruined, it always smells again an hour after I've scrubbed it with urine neutralizer. As I've said, I'm about to lose it. I have no idea what else to do. Has anyone else's cat done this? I am going to replace the carpet, but it's sort of pointless if she's just going to keep doing it. 




 All my examples are strangers thinking our family needs assistance.

The first is me. I don't remember this, but I've heard my parents tell it. When I was about 5, I asked my mom for a PBJ sandwich, but she said no because it would fill me up and I wouldn't eat my dinner. So I simply went a few houses over and asked the neighbors working outside if I could have a sandwich. They made me one, but since they didn't know my family well, they followed me home to ask my mom if we had enough money for food.

The second time my sister was in 2nd grade, and told the teacher we didn't have anything to eat in the house. The truth was that my parents were on a health food kick and there wasn't anything she wanted to eat, so to her, we had no food. We got a call from the counselor asking if we needed help applying for food stamps.

The third example is about my cousin. In high school he refused to wear anything but these ratty worn out pair of boots. My aunt got a call from the teacher offering to buy him a new pair of shoes if they were going through a tough time. 














 Also, my account is now 27 hours old. Why is it still not letting me have a shop? 









 The Most Interesting Man in the World. It's never been funny. Ever. 




 http://hamptonroads.com/2009/10/military-men-are-silent-victims-sexual-assault

We were discussing the current controversy about women in the military and having to "expect" to be raped in the equality subreddit, and someone said it's a common hazing technique on both men and women, even though the spotlight has only been on the female victims. The link above claims 22,000 men were sexually assaulted compared to 14,000 women. If this is true, it's another example of only the women getting the attention and help when the men need it just as much. I thought it was interesting. Too bad not many people realize it. 




 A Clockwork Orange has been one of my favorites since I was 15. I love the original Picture of Dorian Gray from the 40s(and have since high school). I recently saw the original Doctor Zhivago, and loved it. 

I hate the stereotype that teenagers and people in their 20s only like the shit rappers put out. A lot of us have better taste than that. 




 I've had this dream several times. I am in my grandparents' old house. It might be important to state that I miss this house very much. I felt more at home here than I did my own house, and I moved away when I was 11. Well, anyway, I am in the bathroom, and I plan to take a bath. But the bath tub is filthy, so I decide not to. I then go to the sink to brush my teeth, but the sink is disgusting too. At this point, my grandpa tries to come into the bathroom. I am naked or in a state of undress, so I try to stop him. The door is suddenly unlocked (it was locked before), so I have to push back against it. My grandma suffered from alzheimers for about 10 years before his death, so several times he'd try to come into the bathroom on you, not understanding why the door wouldn't open and why you wouldn't let him in, but he was never this bad while he lived in the house I was dreaming about. 


I'd normally consider it to be just a weird dream, but I'd have it several times. It might also be worth mentioning that I am fickle about bath tubs. I will only bathe in a clean, familiar one. In places like hotels, I will only take showers. 




 Ever. He's nearly 23.

I thought this was something that happened to every guy. Any other guy ever been this lucky? 









 I just want to share this wonderful thing I saw on court TV(which I usually hate). First off, this man and woman came into court, both saying the other was guilty of domestic violence. Of course, the audience automatically sided with the woman, even though the woman had no proof he ever beat her. Lucky for the man, he had police reports proving the woman was arrested for domestic violence three times. Then the woman claimed he owed her thousands in child support. The man retorted, "No, I don't, and here's the proof." He had brought several receipts proving he didn't owe a dime. He also showed the judge a text the woman sent him, basically saying, "I'm never letting you see your kids, HAHAHAHA!" So the judge awarded him *several thousand dollars* for his mental suffering, since she had kept him from the kids for months. The man got everything he was there for, the woman was proven to be a lying bitch and by the end of the show, the audience was cheering for the judge's decision.

I hope the man realizes how lucky and smart he was to keep all that paperwork. Without it, there is no doubt the woman would have been believed.

It was Judge Joe Brown, or one of those.
 














 I was put on Paxil 10mg at age 11. I felt better until about 19, I guess. I went to the doctor every 6 months for a med check. The doc always asked if it was still working, and I said yes until I was about 21 even though I had been feeling steadily worse for 2 years. I'm not sure why I waited so long to say anything, but I don't really like to talk about wishing I was dead to people, even people who are there to help. I just said it felt like it was slowing down, so I was moved to 30mg, then 40. I was taking that for a year and it really didn't feel any difference, but I didn't say anything and was on 40 for about a year. Then in October I found out I was pregnant, and since Paxil has a bad birth defect risk I was weaned off it and onto Buspar. I ended up miscarrying at about 6 weeks, but I'm still on the Buspar. Now ever since around the new year I've been feeling pretty crappy. I live out in the middle of nowhere (and continuing my lengthy job quest), and it takes a tank of gas to go anywhere, so I've really been unable to leave the house, which I'm sure isn't helping matters any. I'm wondering if the Buspar simply isn't as good as Paxil, or if it wouldn't matter in the first place since Paxil was losing its effectiveness. I know it's pretty stupid to not share much with the doctor besides, "Eh, I need more" but it takes so much energy, mostly emotional, to voice it to anyone. That's probably why I wouldn't get too far with a therapist either. It's not that I'm too private, it just takes so much out of me to discuss it. 

This was mostly a rant, but I'd gladly hear from others who feel the same. 




 My entire childhood I remember my mom yelling at my dad for going right from the shower to the bed without drying off at all, and my boyfriend only dries his face off. Then he pulls on his clothes while still soaking wet. I cannot stand getting dressed if I am the least bit wet from the bath. And isn't getting your clothes on difficult if they keep sticking to you? Someone explain this to me. 




 I especially want to hear from males, since it seems fairly common in females.

Anyone see Monty Python's Life of Brian? For the scene where Graham Chapman opens the window naked, the director Terry Jones said, "We can tell you aren't Jewish mate," and they applied a rubber band to imitate the look. Not a very good job, IMO! Anyway, yep, nice foreskin. 




 As I'm nearly impossible to get to orgasm, I usually just go until I get tired. By then I'm too exhausted to do anything but lay there. 




 Females: Does you labia hang low or are they small?

Males: Does your foreskin hang past the glans? (Circumcised men N/A, obviously)

Females: Can you orgasm with vaginal stimulation only?

Males: How long does it take from the moment of climax for your erection to totally go away?  




 When I was about 10, my parents rented a room with one of those doors that lead into the next room if you unlock both doors. All night someone knocked on the other side. Both my parents were too freaked out to aggressively pound back on the door, and they were too nervous to even walk to the office and complain. I don't remember being that scared, but maybe there was more going on than what I can remember.

Whoever it was, they were dedicated. They knocked softly on that door for hours. 




 Everyone posts the tl;dr version of their story, and the ones with the most upvotes must tell the whole version. 




 I ate some sausage for breakfast, maybe it was undercooked. 




 I'm 22, and have no idea what I want to do in life. I was in nursing school but I realized although the pay would be good, I'd absolutely hate every second of it, and honestly, I'm squeamish. But I have always loved history. I was disappointed in my high school history classes because they were so very basic. My dad has a history degree, but he's never done anything with it, he delivers packages, but I've liked reading through his old school books over the years. If I invested a lot of time and money in this degree, could I do anything with it? I know you can teach, work in a museum, etc, but is it the same as other non-scientific degrees? Tons of people wanting 2 openings and the rest having to move on to something else? I know the classes would be wonderful education wise, but I really can't spend thousands of dollars on something that won't lead to a career. Thanks for your input! 




 Not sure how I would prove this, so I'll just include some curious details. My doctor doesn't know why this is happening. I've tried fiber. I'm anemic so I'm on iron tables. Iron tablets can cause constipation, so this is weird as well. I even had doctors notes for my teachers telling them to let me spend as much time in the bathroom as I might need. The "attacks" come on quite quickly and I can be in the bathroom from 10 minutes to half an hour. I might have a solid bowel movement once out of every 5 times I go to the bathroom. The rest is pure liquid. The doc suspected IBS, but nothing I was given worked to help it. It's made trying to work quite a challenge. 









 As the only loser that still plays Sims 1, sometimes I run into old Sim sites that have turned into a page selling insurance. 




 I never understood how a chemical imbalance in your brain could make you feel worthless or hopeless. I know evolution plays a part as well, what is that about? 




 The true answer is that the economy is crap and no one will hire me. It's difficult enough getting a damn interview. But I can't say that, what do I say instead? 









 I just ordered my Diva cup. I know it takes a bit of learning to properly use it, but do you have any tips? I also know I have to be careful what soap I use and how I should boil it after each period. How long should this cup last? Anything else?

 I've whispered to myself for years. It's usually the last few words of a sentence I've just said. For instance, I might tell my dad about something that happened during the day. Let's say my story ended with,"So then, he finally left!" For about thirty seconds, I'll whisper under my breath, "He finally left, he finally left," until something else catches my attention or someone brings up that I'm whispering to myself again. Sometimes if I think of something in my head, like, "Oh yeah, I have to feed the dog," I'll whisper, "Feed the dog, feed the dog," over and over without even realizing it. But sometimes, I will whisper things that I haven't even thought of. This morning, I was sitting while putting my shoes on and thinking about a movie I wanted to watch. My sister says, "You know, that's creepy." "What's creepy?" "You whispering over and over again that dad told you to let the dog out." The scary thing? Dad had said no such thing to me. He was still in bed. I wasn't even thinking of the dog. What's even more concerning is that it's happening more frequently. I'll whisper things no one said; things I'm not even thinking about.
Maybe soon it'll be on the news that I've killed my family with a steak knife while maniacally repeating the lyrics to a song. 




 This isn't homework or anything, I'm just curious. I love history and all the explanations I can find are too wordy.  




 One of my aunt's friends. She says using a lot of water is wasteful, so she only showers once a week, and even then, she doesn't use any soap. She doesn't brush her teeth and only washes her clothes in water(after several wears). Anyway, she was telling us toilet paper is bad for the environment. She said she didn't use it unless she had diarrhea. She also never flushes the toilet unless there is poop.

Actually, I don't think David was all that attractive, but Graham was. I'd love to see his screwing anyone! 




 I'm only curious, since it's well known they're very bad for the vagina. 




 Remember, I'm 5, and have no idea why I should have an opinion on this, and why politicians do. 

Also, when did the current calender we use come into use, year-wise? I know they didn't say, "Okay, Jesus is here, this is year one." Obviously that came later.  




 I understand you might cry if you need to get something out of your eye, but what purpose does crying when you're hurt or because you're sad serve?

Oh, I don't mean why do people cry, I mean why is that a response that's possible? 









 Just want to state that I'm one of the few women who supports this.
