 I have actually never seen Batman: Year 100 mentioned ever...how is it? 




 When is year 2 due? 




 I didn't know I wanted Zack Morris as Green Lantern until now. I agree with the reasoning. 




 Find a strain that causes weed-induced psychosis for the general populace, much like how any weed can cause psychosis in the few, like me, that are just unlucky. That's a way to get someone to 'cure' their addiction real quick...shit sucks yo. 




 It was crazy hard and you couldnt save between rounds.

I remember just leaving my Playstation running because I had to leave for a Midnight Mass. 




 Because people like. I know I do and everyone I know that watched it did too. 




 That final boss fight tho. Took forever to beat. 




 I had the same problem with reading it. Maybe that is the point? 




 Still waiting for 7 :/ 




 Enjoying the new art more honestly. Not to knock the old style, but this is easier to follow. 




 I did that with issue #3. It really keeps pace. 




 A weird issue. Just a giant flashback.

 Suiciders from Vertigo.

Divinity from Valiant.

Supreme Blue Rose from Image. 




 I read them as they were released. It is a really weird story.

It did introduce me to a favorite artist of mine, Tula Lotay. 




 Locke and Key. I didnt really expect much, but I was wrong. It is great. 




 It was an ok issue. A lot of questions as to what exactly is happening. Art is cool tho.  




 Been needing to get the second volume of Project Superpowers. Good thing this bundle will last a month. 




 I like the feel of it. Can't wait for my issue to come in. 




 Valiant is finally starting to have a following here. A couple weeks back all their issues for the week were on the top 10. 




 **DC Comics**

**Titan Comics**

 No big deal. A Family of 11 was pissed they couldnt sit together when the bought their tickets at 7:33pm for the 7:30pm showing on a Saturday night. 




 Lines around the building of course 




 Only if you film it in Britain 




 So excited 




 Looks decent. The last one had a ton of Locke and Key 




 **BOOM!**

 Basically it is saying that it won't be a typical hero movie.

It is not exactly a big deal, but a huge sigh of relief to get confirmation that the movie is on the right track.

Either way I highly suggest picking up a volume or two of Sandman. Few rarely regret it. 




 The guy next to bizarro's shoulder kinda looks like deadpool o.O 




 According to the article Levitt has been talking to Gaiman. 




 The 30$ Books collection are very much worth it. 




 I'm going to leave [this](http://imgur.com/jQlWPKx) here. **8** comments at 2:5**8**

It is 8s all the way down.... 




 So who was the one cheating in relation to Jupiter's Legacy?

 WE WANT 100 CARD DECKS AND WE WANT THEM NOW!!! 




 Before I updated to 5.0 the lockscreen had a music control bar on it. After the update now the background of the lockscreen is the album cover. I am wondering if there is a way to put back contols on the lock screen. I don't mind the album artwork, but I would really like not having to unlock my phone to skip a song or pause. 




 One of the best current(ish) runs. I want them to bring Constantine into the mix.  




 Didn't the beard come when he was in office? 




 How much all that run you? 




 I do that too for some reason. Alphabetical Left to right by series, but chronological right to left within a series. 




 The conclusion released today was excellent. Can't wait to see me. 




 I like it. Interested on where it is heading. 




 It is getting good. 




 Very well done and amazing art as always. 




 At least it is still their universe. 




 The splash page when the planet gets obliterated was well done. The dirt seemed to be moving. 




 Now back to your regularly scheduled programming! 




 Issue is as funny as always and I can't wait to see how the brothers react when Ivar brings them back together. 




 **Ivar, Timewalker #5** 




 Oh wow. The art gets me everytime, a bit easier to follow the flow than the last issue. Just one more left. . . 




 A decent end to the first volume. Can't wait to read Imperium #7 and then Divinity 2 




 Good to hear! We need more Valiant readers here. 




 All this narrated by Deadpool of course. 




 Let's get us Blade/Deadpool crossover! 




 **Divinity #4** 




 Shadowman and Bloodshot are both part of Valiant. The comics got rebooted from the 90s a couple years ago. Since they are all pretty fresh it is easier to play catch up on. From the looks of it you would probably like The Death-Defying Dr. Mirage and Quantum and Woody, but really most Valiant titles are pretty spot on. Today Valiant actually released the trade for their 4 part series called The Valiant, in which Bloodshot plays a main role.

Now for other classics check out the other comments is this thread, but a personal favorite of mine is Vertigo's Sandman.

Comic can get expensive and a good place to find trades on the cheap is instocktrades.com.

Also check out your local Library! 




 Speaking of Alan Moore, Providence #1 comes out today ^.^ 




 I'm glad Sandman still made the list despite massive delays. 




 If you are not looking to sell them as singles or sets, http://www.mycomicshop.com/ will buy whole collections. 




 I could be wrong, but this is not the right meme for that. 




 And probably less than 1% of Drivers are avid climbers, so it may just scale. . . 




 You see her grinding up the gold for a second during one of the scenes. 




 They have been hinting that it is yea. 




 A Sound of Thunder has a song called Punk Mambo, which is about Punk Mambo from Valiant's Shadowman. The track is pretty solid.

 I wouldn't mind a Sandman movie. An Animated movie would give them way more room to tell the story. 




 My LCS sold out pretty fast and I cant find it online to order :( 




 **White Whale**

**Holy Grail**

**White Whale**

**Holy Grail** 




 Yup typo. And Bible lore 




 SexymadbadDrWho

well....that is pretty much an Endorsement. 




 Should have offered to clean them fo her.

 If anything she will avoid helping the Winchesters at all costs. They made her murder her forgotten love. I'm thinking she is gonna just decide to upset the balance further, I mean if the Book can get rid of a spell by God, what else can it do? Hell on Earth? Sap all magic from everyone else? 




 "Like a good neighbor, ~~State Farm~~ Chuck is there" 




 2nd to last episode of the season. It is mentioned the airfield is closed due to a missing pilot. 




 With that comment the current script for Season 11 has been scrapped... 




 You clearly are high. 




 It was bold and unread right? 




 Learning new spells to become more powerful = powering up. 




 Well the Mark got zapped up into the sky after leaving Dean. When then see the same zaps hitting the earth where the Darkness escapes from.

Not to mention the Mark was said to be both a lock and a key, so I figure it is gone until being recast. 

Rowenna probably just used her time to read other parts of the book to power up. 




 That's exactly how we look and sound like in Texas during tornado season. 




 Well the Host of the Trinity did ascended Gid knows where 2000 years ago  and the Word of the trinity is potentially being held captive by Metatron who has the tablet. Surely the Father will finally make an appearance now that the primordial shit has literally hit the fan and is going everywhere. 




 Didn't realize the decay was partly due to his immense power. 

Season 11: God reveals himself by saving Sam and Dean from getting swallowed by the Darkness wave, since they are the true vessels for Lucifer and Michael (God needs them to defeat the Darkness again of course) who both get let out (Due to the huge potential power of the Book of the Damned) and end up using Sam and Dean as their all too willing hosts. All of them go through the whole season in typical hunter, monster of the week, fashion fighting the Darkness. 




 If anything I figured he got elevated to like Angel status or something, but never thought he was God.  




 I think the Darkness' influence quit being built up after he passed it to Cain, but he was still pretty sour that God cast him away for a long time due to something Luci had no control over. I think the influence is finally gone, but the resentment is still everlasting. 




 Was he never followed up on after the episode *Fan Fiction* ?

I was reading up on him and when did it get revealed he was God? I don't recall that, just him being a Prophet.

Was Calliope in *Fan Fiction* really going to try to devour God? 




 All I know is I can't wait for the inevitable Series follow-up comic by IDW or Dark Horse. Not that I want the series to end any time soon. 




 Thinking on it, doesn't Death know the order of Reapings? If so, he knew that his time had come and knew the Winchesters would never kill each other. 




 Did I see right: In the beginning of the episode we see an unopened email from Crowley(?) With the subject line something like: "S11 See attachment".  ? 




 What else can the Book of the Damned do if it can remove a spell that was cast by God himself? That is going to be a huge plot point next season if anything. 




 If the Darkness being released has retroactive effects on its host I can see that. Lucifer was probably still salty about being locked up for dam near eternity. 




 Well Dean didnt know they finally got the spell ready to remove the mark, he was probably planning to let Sam lock him up again. 




 Well it wasnt the previous Death...so Dean kills God. 




 It was a Magic scapel of course. 




 But was anything ever done when the prophet/supernatural writer showed up at the end of that episode? 




 He can possess people, just not for long right? 




 There is a huge potential for extra lore. If the book can remove a spell/curse done by God himself, what else can it do? 




 Well an article posted elsewhere in the comics is saying that they are offering full returnability for the issues on top of a big discount. Also the following issues are going 1:10 instead of 1:25. I would think selling the Geomancer at a high price (40$ like midtown?) Might help recoop the costs some while waiting to return un bought issues. 




 Well it is $40 on Preorder at Midtown currently if you really want to read it. I know I got mine pre-ordered already. 




 I agree with this. The meta is heavy here. It isn't even on the Book of Death checklist page in the Previews.
