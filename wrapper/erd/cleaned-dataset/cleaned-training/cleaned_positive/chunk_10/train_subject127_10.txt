 Thank you so much for your kindness. But honestly, I don't think he is completely to blame. I just think we were both in the worst state at the worst time to be together, and that is why we clashed. If things can't be sorted out, then I will start thinking about separating, for the sake of both of us. But right now, I want to be able to face him and talk. I just don't have the courage or the confidence to, and it makes me hate myself 




 I have, and ironically, he wants to be left alone and in isolation... and I want to be near someone. What should I do...? 




 Thanks so much for your reply. My boyfriend actually has a mood disorder, and to his defense I think he was in his bad mood swings. However, I also feel that I have explained what I want when I am feeling like this to him before hand. Do you think he is just getting tired and annoyed of me and my depression? The word abuse has cropped up before from my therapist, but they see me as in denial
