 Mine were very useful. I was initially assessed as per their guidelines, after which they had the choice to offer me either self-taught assistance eg CBT courses, counselling, or psychotherapy. I had some serious issues and so was offered 12-16 sessions with a psychotherapist.

My therapist was professional, but friendly and welcoming. Each week I had to complete a questionnaire about my moods and feelings over the last two weeks, this was very quick to do and she would let me complete it before the session so that we had as much time together as possible.

I had one session per week, each one lasting a little over 50 minutes. 




 Completely free on the NHS. I had 12 weekly sessions. 




 I switched to Decaff tea about four months ago and I have really noticed a difference in both my anxiety, and IBS symptoms. I am so glad I switched :) 




 Depression, Generalized anxiety disorder, Panic disorder, medicated and seeing a therapist for the last 14 years on and off. 




 Thank you :) 

Even this morning he is so much better - and no sickness in anyone else yet! 




 Thank you :) 




 Thanks :) 




 Anti-bac spray, hand sanitiser all being used, confined him to his room (with books and 3DS) to try to keep him away from his sister.

The mindfullness I am good at writing down during an attack after a LOT of practice. It is keeping those thoughts going I have trouble with! 




 I am trying very hard to be calm and not 'catastrophise' him being sick.

I know he is sick because of either a tummy bug going through school, or something he ate.

I know that the chances of us all getting it are reasonably low, especially with good hygiene. 

Even if we do all get it, it will be over soon. I will manage.

It is not going to be this way forever. This too shall pass.

It does not mean I am letting people down if I have to cancel things because of this.

I will get through this. 




 Yes - and I am still trying to overcome my need to please everyone ahead of myself to this day :( 




 Have a listen to this before you go to the airport, and see if it might be something you can use :)

 I also am not comfortable with the use of 'spoon theory'.

It bugs me in similar ways as it does yourself OP. It is an oversimplification of issues, with a long and drawn out explanation of what it actually means.

I have depression and anxiety, as well as a chronic joint and muscle condition. I have days where I can do some things, then the following day I can barely walk. My muscles become easily exhausted, and also take longer than 'normal' to recover from exertion. 

I don't really see why it can't be as simple as saying, "you know what, I really overdid it yesterday, and I am paying for it today". 

Sometimes I feel there is the overwhelming need to feel 'recognised' with an invisible illness. Creating the cutesie terminology gives a sense of bonding between people who go through the same issues. But I also feel that it can be seen as belittling a real problem that millions suffer with every day. 




 Low level panic attack, up to 24 hours.Mid-level, anywhere from 2-3 hours. High level, between 20-30 minutes. Cyclic attacks going from high to low level rapidly, anywhere from 2-3 hours to 24 hours. 




 I killed Hitler by throwing a bomb into the closet he was hiding in. He took a school hostage and I went in there and took him out, rescuing everyone else.

 Hi, I have been on Buspar for the last 6 months alongside Citalopram.

I currently take 7.5mg twice a day. It really has helped me with my anxiety and panic attacks. It took a little while to start feeling the full effects, but I guess after two weeks I could really feel a big difference.

As for side effects, I didn't really have any at all. I was pretty lucky. In fact, it has actually helped eased some of the side effects of other medication (non-anxiety related). 

I hope it works for you too :) 




 This owl looks like Radagast the Brown 




 It's a known issue, pretty much all EU servers are down and have been since yesterday. Blizz are updating their twitter feed, but no eta for a fix yet. Which sucks as I DC'd just after killing the Headless Horseman :( 




 Please listen to u/sayleanenlarge. You need to see a Dr if you are having seizures. 




 Hadn't looked to be honest. 




 I have an EU and US account. There was a glitch that meant 6.0 has updated on my account and now I can't play until tomorrow when the patch goes live.

On the plus side, I got to see the awesome new intro early. 




 Wooo I score 9 - do I get a prize?

(actually I do have Hypermobility syndrome and I am waiting on diagnosis for Ehler-Danlos Type 3 (Hypermobility)) 




 The top comment on here (posted 10 hours ago) is a link to the local news piece on him being missing. 




 Glad I can make you feel a bit better :D

It's weird, but because I have lived with it most of my life, I don't really notice it unless it gets really bad. Every now and then I have to suddenly correct my posture or stop myself from locking my knees back, but other than that I don't notice it as often as other people notice me for it - sometimes I stretch my joints the wrong way and freak people out accidentally :)

But yes, the pain sucks! 




 My dad used the quote and credited Homer Simpson during his wedding speech :) 




 Basically, diagnosis comes from assessing how hypermobile (super-bendy) you are, and then running every test known to man to rule out anything else they can come up with ;)

I have to make sure I don't get fatigued, stand or sit the wrong way, dislocate or sub-dislocate my joints (I can do my fingers and toes for fun!) and basically just try to exercise as much as I can to maintain muscle strength without doing anything I have just said!

It is pretty hard to keep going some days, especially when you live almost everyday in pain. 

Right now I am going through a really bad flareup. My hands and fingers are swollen and so is one ankle. Lots of anti-inflammatories and hopefully it will settle soon. 




 I am hoping it was a one time thing. I have IBS and gastro issues from the hypermobility syndrome (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type3 really).

I do love the WoW community :) 




 I feel for you with the stomach issues. I had ulcerative colitis last year and I cannot imagine the pain of having more than one episode of it.

I hope are well at the moment :)

Have you tried Skyrim? ;) 




 :) 









 Mental health issues seem to be a common issue being 'helped' by WoW. Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt eh? :)

I deal with anx and dep frequently because of the side effects of pain meds, and because of being in constant pain at times. 

I hope you are going through a good time right now :) 




 Yeah, you don't realise how much you use your wrists in day to day life until you have pain in them. 




 Maybe with the new expansion and people coming back into the game you will find a raiding team :)

 




 I hope you get to feeling better over time. Have you read about PTSD and Tetris? I saw something recently that was implying a positive effect on PTSD symptoms from playing Tetris. 




 Now I want to play Skyrim again too :)

I am glad that you seem to be in a better place now. It is pretty incredible the number of people that have had WoW have a profound effect on their lives. 




 I will have to have a look at that. 




 I would say it counts. Depression is a big issue with chronic pain conditions.

I was always a bit of a misfit too, WoW vanilla was one of the first places I actually felt I could be me and happy. 




 Very basic at the moment. Comfortable chair, reasonable desk. Wireless mouse and keyboard so I can have the freedom to move it to where I need it. Splints for my wrists to stop me moving them too much. Mouse mat with a gel cushion, looking for one for my keyboard too.

I have to have room in front of my desk so I can put my legs up if needed. 




 Similar playing history to me :) I played vanilla to Cata, then dropped in and out depending on how much I had going on in my life. 




 That is so sad :( But I am glad he had friends online to help him forget for a while. 




 It does seem to let people get away from health issues for a while :) 




 It does help pass the time! :) 




 I have always played a hunter though in different specs. I always prefered the ranged dps over melee.

I think when WoD comes out I will continue leveling my new hunter (just switched between USA and EU servers) and roll a new lvl 90. I need to think on how I want to go with it though.

JRA is a horrible condition, I really feel for you. I have hypermobility syndrome and I am waiting on a diagnosis for Ehlers-Danlos type 3. Basically on a good day I am fine, on a bad day I can't move because the ligaments and tendons all over my body are inflamed.

Do you modify your set up to account for wrist pain? I am looking to try to find a more comfortable way to play. 




 Yeah, I got hooked back in seeing an advert for WoD. Thought about the fun I used to have playing and before I knew it I was logged back on ;) 




 Not really, no. I am genuinely interested.

But some people are asses.... 




 I have played on and off since 2005, but recently I have realised that I play more when my chronic pain condition is bad. 

Immersing in the game actually lets me do things I want to be doing IRL without pain - walking, traveling, socialising. Also, getting wrapped up in quest lines and grinding mats makes the time pass faster between doses of painkillers :)


I was just wondering if any other players do this?



**edit** so lots of us then :)  




 I started it 3 weeks ago and it has been good so far. 

Much less panic and anxiety, not too many side effects (felt nauseated for a few days), but the pros far outweigh the cons.

I am taking 7.5mg twice a day alongside 20mg citalopram.

Hope it helps you too x 




 Thanks :-)

 Thanks :-)

Not doing too badly considering!

I am now on BuSpar for the panic attacks, and I can continue taking this until I am back in the UK and under a Dr there.

The kids are doing ok, they have been free to ask any questions they wanted to. My youngest is having issues with anxiety and worry, but we are working through it. My eldest is angry and upset, but again, we are working on talking through feelings. They both have people outside of the family that they can talk to aswell.

We fly back in two weeks from today. In fact, in exactly two weeks we will be in the air on our way home right now.

Thank you for your thoughts, it means a lot xxx 




 That the Aswan Dam was built in Egypt (?) and named after President Aswan. Due to stopping the natural flooding that occured each year, the soils along the river became nutrient depleted and there was also a correlating rise in the incidents of bilharzia, and disease spread by small aquatic creatures.

Thanks to Geography lessons 20 years ago. 




 Thanks :-) Took my first one last night and certainly noticed the drowsiness. I slept pretty well. Taking one this morning will let me know what I am in for during the day, at least I am not in work today! 




 :-) 




 Weird! I will look out for that :-( 




 About to start on 7.5mg of Buspar twice a day. I already take Citalopram 20mg daily and the new med is to try to relieve the panic and anxiety issues I have been having.
Has anyone else used this combination? How did it work for you? How were the side effects?
TIA x

edit: bit worried about trying it now :( 




 Thank you x 




 I have to tell my two kids (4 and 7) in the next 24 hours that my husband and I are separating and that the kids and I are moving back to the UK without him in about four weeks (his choice pretty much). 

My IBS panic symptoms have set in, I am nauseous and have an upset stomach. I am trying to breathe, but it keeps getting overwhelming.

My husband is not offering much in the way of support towards this, in fact he is at the bar with friends right now.

I am out of lorazepam (got anxious about seeing the Dr and now can't see him until next Weds). 

Please help me through this. 




 Actually 12 weeks ago he told me he didn't love me, and 11 weeks and 6 days ago he said he didn't know. 

If I am responsible from trying to work something out rather than just ending it all when he wasn't sure, then yes. I did that. 




 He is refusing to go to any further counselling.

He has agreed to allow me full residency of the children whilst I am in the UK without him. We are trying to arrange financial agreements right now.

We will be telling the kids at the end of this week. It is going to be hell and heartbreaking to do, but they need time to ask questions. 




 Thank you :-) 




 Thank you :-) 




 Thank you x 




 It was pretty negative and basically blaming me for the breakup. Trying hard to forget what they said and focus on the positives.

Thank you x 




 Thank you. It feels very strange right now. I guess almost a feeling of relief coupled with a great amount of sadness. 




 I guess I can always truthfully say I tried. 




 I had to smile reading this comment, as I have actually just sat down with a cup of tea :-) 




 Because he is refusing to return to the therapist. He does not want to fix the issues. 




 I have given him space for 12 weeks. Would you want to be in the same situation, 4000 miles from family and not knowing what your future holds?
The therapist herself told him that he needed to make a decision and stick to it because of the emotional and physical stress he has out me through. 




 Thank you. It feels absolutely horrible right now, and as if it is my fault the marriage is over. But I really dont know what more I could have done. 




 **TL:DR** I have finally taken the steps to end the marriage and to get me and the kids  back to the UK. I wish I had taken r/relationships advice sooner, but was caught in in what I can see now is an emotionally abusive trap.

So basically (in case you don't want to read the previous posts), 12 weeks ago my husband told me that he no longer loved me. He became unreliable, unhelpful and swung between begging me to stay and telling me he wanted a divorce. 

Up until this last week, he had refused to see a marriage therapist. Saturday last week, he told me again it was over and he wanted a divorce. Sunday he begged me to stay and promised he would come to my therapy session on Thursday.

He did come along. Lots was discussed about my control issues (stemming from panic and anxiety issues along with abandonment issues). I knew I needed to work on this and had been working on strategies with my therapist for the last two months.

He admitted that he didn't want to make any decisions because it was too hard for him. The therapist identified some issues with him that she feels need addressing soon, such as his inability to react positively to responsibility in the family unit. He feels I am trapping him into decisions and becomes beligerent and shuts down when he feels like he doesn't want to do something.

The therapist told us that the issues we are having are very workable, and that if he chose to work though them, she felt he may be able to resolve the reasons why he feels he doesn't love me anymore. 

She said it was important to work though these feelings so that, even if the marriage ended, he would be able to move on in a positive way with his life and not fall into a reccurring pattern of these feelings.

He asked to have until Saturday to decide whether he wanted to go on with trying to work on the marriage and going to further sessions with the therapist, or whether it had gone too far to be saved.

At this point I had been emotionally thrown around for the whole twelve weeks, with him messing with my mind, my feelings and I am physically exhausted and affected by all the stress.

I asked him Saturday evening if he had come to a decision. He sat with me for a long time in silence, occasionally asking to clarfiy certain things I felt, or had said at the therapy session. He then fell asleep on the sofa. I woke him and asked for his decisiin and he started to get angry. Finally he snapped at me that we would separate and 'there, I had my answer now'. 

Sunday he came into my room and sat with me. He started crying about separating and how he was miserable and would miss the kids etc. I told him that if he felt so miserable about his decision, then maybe it was not what he actually wanted. He agreed to think it over and to talk to me again last night.

Well, again he could not make up his mind. He was being really nice to me, telling me he was still physically attracted to me etc. I told him that was innapropriate right now and that for my own sanity he needed to tell me what he wanted. He got up to go and get a soda from downstairs, and when I went to find him, he was asleep on the chair. I gave up and went to bed.

This morning, he was in a bad mood. I sent him an IM as sometimes he responds better to indirect conversation, but he ignored it. I gave him a while and asked if he wanted to talk. He told me that if I had anything to say I would need to go to the basement with him as he was going to work out before going to his friends house.

I went down and asked him if he had made his mind up. He started to get frustrated and I reminded him that I was going throug hell and deserved a decision so that I could be looking to the future one way or another. He told me that he had already told me his decision (despite the tears from yesterday and not knowing what he wanted). I told him that saying that was no good to me and that he needed to give me a straight, honest answer. He looked at me angrily and told me he wanted us to separate.

I went back up to my room and skyped my mum and dad. They have been aware of the situation for a few weeks and have offered a lot of support and a place to live temporarily if I went back to the UK.

I then wrote an email to the guy in charge of my husbands tour in the US and asked him to let me know if they can help me get back to the UK with the kids. They pay for most of our stuff here and are responsible for flying us around. I am hoping they will agree to get me and the kids back to the UK and to help me with any paperwork needed. I have told them the situation and made it clear that I need to get out of here for my emotional and psychological well being. I told them that my husband has tokd me that he wants a divorce and no longer wants me (and through that the kids) living here.

Obviously it is a holiday weekend in the US as well as in the UK right now, so I will have to wait until tomorrow at the earliest to hear from him.

My parents are starting to build supply kits of food etc that I can take to a new home as soon as I can find one in the UK. They are also looking out to get furnishings etc for me and the kids.

Husband has not told his parents any of this so far. They arrive for a holiday here in three weeks. I am not responsible for him anymore so I am leaving it up to him to tell them. In fact, recently he requested that I did not talk to them until he had done so. If they ask why I didnt tell them, I will let them know.

I am emotionally drained, devestated and physically exhausted from everything that is haooening, and from holding everything in for the last 12 weeks. I have been trying to keep my kids from being affected, even though I know they are picking up on the tension in the house. They are great kids and I am going to keep them as safe and happy as I possibly can.

For the record, I offered (to see his reaction TBH) to leave the kids here with him, and he couldn't agree to it, despite his protests about missing them. Apparently the feeling only goes so far.

So, I have done it. I am cutting 15 years of my life away. But it has to be done, or else how can I show my children what love is?

Apologies for spelling etc. I am still pretty shaky and not entirely functioning right now.

 




 Lisa calls him because she is lonely at the camp and asks him to tell his old stories I believe. He gets tired of talking to her for once!

 Bread roll :-) 




 Thanks :)

Yes, lots of unnecessary procedures, blood draws, and antibiotics!

I have been on citalopram for the last 10 years or so, for the depression more than the anxiety. It seems to help me stay balanced enough to just about cope, without loosing all ability to feel.

I hope it does get easier! 




 Looking back with my psych, we have identified GAD symptoms as far back as when I was six. I probably began to be heavily impacted by them from when I was about 14-16. I was misdiagnosed several times as Drs sought to find a 'physical' reason for my symptoms. I was officially diagnosed when I was 19 following a breakdown at university. 

For me the anxiety was definately an escalating issue, but as I do not really remember a time when I was not anxious, it has always been with me.

As for panic attacks, I had mild ones as I was growing up, they usually manifested in throwing up and shaking uncontrollably. As throwing up is common in kids, no one thought it was out of the ordinary.

More recently I have has severe and dehibilitating panic attacks that have left me with agoraphobia and claustrophobia issues, difficulty in socializing, depersonalization and physical health issues. I was medicated for a short while when these started, but have tried to manage them without meds more recently. I do miss the security of popping a tablet and feeling the calm descend

I am however, still holding down a job and managing to look after my kids. It is just about possible to function with high anxiety and panic, but it is extremely exhausting both physically and mentally. 




 Thanks! :-) 




 Will do! 




 Nope, they quoted me the same for both types :-(

I think I also had a grumpy store assistant with no xmas spirit! 




 It is good to see ECE getting some love for once :-) 




 Nor did I until I went to post my stuff! :-) 




 Just a warning, if you are posting overseas, the USPS charge cardboard envelopes and bubble wrap envelopes differently.

I was sending some xmas cards to the UK. In a cardboard envelope, they were going to be $6. In a bubble wrap envelope, they were going to be $36. 

The difference is that they class overseas in bubble wrap as a parcel, not a letter.
