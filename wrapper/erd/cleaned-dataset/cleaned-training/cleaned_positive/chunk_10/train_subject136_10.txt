 They're bout a 34 waist on a whim and the inseam is the same as my other pants (34)
 




 I'm down.  I live in Westwood and shoot with a Sony NEX.  I've been wanting to step my photography game up too. 




 Bah gawd!  




 Is there anyway to read this for free w/o Kindle?  I left mine at home and I'm out of town for the next 3 months.   




 I can imagine.  I do photography as well and you've inspired me.  I typically make people the focus of my pictures but I'm going to try something different for a bit. 




 I honestly wish I hadn't.  My phone has been super slow and the battery drain is ridiculous.  It's also hot all the time too.

A lot of issues are reported here:

A reset doesn't seem to solve them as well. 




 Good premise but I was disappointed that at the end of that article it was just an attempt to sell some books.

The "Keys for Life" are too broad to just follow as a how-to on their own.  This topic could easily be organized into a 5 step tutorial with pics (i.e. sample wardrobe combinations). 




 We must find her with Cerebro 




 Dunbar needs "a southerner with a penis" to win.  Remember?  A two lady ticket is probably too polarizing, even in fiction. 




 I though they made it clear that she was going through menopause at an earlier point in the show.  Correct me if I'm wrong however. 




 I've watched this show since the beginning... This is easily the worst season yet  




 I got a Merry Christmas text out of nowhere.  It was hard but I looked at it, and put my phone down and didn't send anything back.

The hardest part is feeling like I'm a jerk for not responding but I think it was the best thing for ME. 




 Great way to put it.  Sometimes people think the pain gets easier but you're right, you just deal with it better. 




 See this is the tough part...  Normally I'd agree with you but in my experience what happens is that if you respond to a quick "Merry Christmas!" text it will quickly be followed up by a "So how is everything going?" text.  

Then you feel obligated to respond to that too and everything comes spiraling down. 




 Sorry, I meant to say we broke up with each other.  It was mutual initially, because we'd always break up and get back together.  This time was different because I wanted to get back together and she disagreed.  I edited my post. 




 That's tough.  I'm in a similar situation (her family lives 4 miles away from mine, bigger city though).  I actually hope that I don't see her.

Is it possible for you to avoid her at all?  At least bring an accountability buddy with you for support and to prevent doing anything regrettable if you see her.  Best of luck. 




 My ex and I broke up over three years ago and initially the thought of not talking to her for a month was AGONIZING.

Fast forward, I spent numerous times breaking NC and trying to work things out over the years to no avail.

I would have a REALLY hard time staying strong when she initiated contact.  I'd say, "Well, what's the harm in engaging in conversation?"  It ultimately would lead to me being more hurt than before.

I can honestly say that now I'm finally ready to move on.  For so long I kept hoping for closure but **I realized that closure comes from within.**  There's nothing more for us to say to each other.

Previously, I would look at my NC counter nervously as it got above 20 days.  I'd dread the impending contact from her side.  Nowadays, I'm excited as the days pile up.  The momentum is great.  I say to myself, "If I can do a month, imagine how three months would feel?  Imagine how a year would feel??!?"

I'm sure a lot of you still have hope of getting back with your ex or a lot of you don't really want to never speak to them again.  I know everyone's situation is different but from my experience I can say that you're better off just sticking with NC.  I wasted 3 years going back and forth.  If I would have just stuck to my guns in the first year I'd be better off right now.

I'm proud of myself and I look forward to being even stronger and taking back control of my life.

*There is one small caveat in which I think it's okay to break NC.  If and only if the person makes it clear that they want to get back together AND it's what you want.  Any other small talk is pointless and will only set you back.*

MERRY CHRISTMAS! (if you celebrate that kinda thing)  I just wanted to share this with you guys.  Stay strong. 




 Take it from me, don't respond.  

It only alleviates their guilt and makes THEM feel better.  Some people could see it as rude but what's the point in responding?  What will it accomplish?

The only time I think folks should respond to an ex is if they're clearly making an effort to talk about reconciliation.  Anything else is just pointless chatter that will get your hopes up and ultimately set you back.

I to have asked myself what I'd do if I got a Christmas text and I'm preparing to ignore it as well. 




 Cool.  That's how you feel.  They still should've talked about this way in advance.

As a matter of fact it should have naturally came up in conversation due to the similarity of their names. 




 I might be in the minority, but I don't think he's being irrational.  It's not uncommon for men to want their wives to take their last names.

With that being said, you guys obviously have communication issues and should've discussed this way before the engagement.

 




 Yeah man, you hit it on the head with the fact that recovery is not a linear  process.

When I went through my first major breakup, I went through the same emotions as you.  Hang in there.  Even years later I'll see something that creates a flashback to happier times and it makes me momentarily sad.  But the moment always fades.

 




 Thanks.  Your intuition is right, she didn't want that kid.  It came out of a one night stand.  

I appreciate the rest of your advice as well. 




 Thanks.  I'm more than prepared to go No Contact.  I dealt with a serious relationship ending a few years ago.

I've kind of developed a "breakup action plan" now.  I"m more concerned with how to deal with my day to day thoughts 




 I've been trying to practice Stoicism for awhile but this caught me off guard.  Never in my life could I have imagined this negative scenario and prepared myself.

I've decided to come here instead of /r/BreakUps because I find working on how I view and react to the events more useful than talking about why things happened.  Because honestly, I'll never know why.

So far the best way to frame this that I can think of is that it was a blessing in disguise.  That I now no longer have to stress about how to find a job near her or how I don't have to worry about any other pressures with her.  

I'm curious to know you guys' thoughts. 




 Can you share your spreadsheet?  I've been trying to do something similar for awhile.

 




 You're not ugly.  Perhaps your standards are too high maybe?  Perhaps you come off as clingy.  Who knows.
 




 Rapgenius is the best that OP is gonna get.  He could always dispute the lyrics to get corrections. 




 You still have feelings... It's impossible to not give a fuck. Nothing anybody says here is gonna change that. Just don't make an ass out of yourself. Matter of fact, you should seriously reevaluate if you should go. 

If you still have feelings you're likely gonna have a bad night. Sorry. 
 




 Where'd you get that rug and how much did it set you back?  I want a nice rug but they're so expensive
 




 Welp, just entered grad school and this destroyed my hope of taking my time to find the right person.  




 Ah yes, such is the way of life. 




 Exactly.  So many times in my life things started off as "let's just have some fun" and escalated to tears and "why can't we be together?!?!"  

Smart men see the future and wisely leave it alone.  Everyone single mom eventually wants a real relationship and father figure for their kids at some point. 




 Can you explain this further?  I don't quite understand.  Was Seneca against forming relationships but more a proponent of deep friendships?

What does "passionate love" mean to a stoic anyway?
 




 Everyone hates it but "After Earth" is pretty much a movie about stoicism. 




 A tenet of Stoicism is imagining negative future events to prepare yourself mentally for if/when they happen. (i.e. loved ones dying, etc.)

Recently I sought to put this idea into practice before going on a jog... to get my mind clear.  As I started the exercise I started imagining myself breaking my leg or getting severely injured and stopped.

I was horrified at the thought and realized that **negative visualization may not always be a good thing for the psyche.**  I couldn't see how imagining the worst case scenario was going to help me in that instant.

Could some of the more experienced Stoics chime in?  Am I thinking about this in the wrong way?  Please help.  Thanks 




 Or you could just do it now and stop being a punk.  It would save a lot of future headache. 




 I need to determine if this is real or a photoshop first.  




 This is the perfect perspective to have but man is it HARD when you're going thru it.  




 I need this too.

 So beat him up then 




 I have.  I haven't taken Prozac in over 5 years.

 Sounds like /r/gonewild beckons you 




 Yes.  I even went to ER for it.  They hooked me up to an EKG and everything.  

Nothing was wrong and they gave me some Xanax.  My hospital bill was crazy too.  After that I've learned to ignore it when I feel like I'm having a heart attack and chalk it up to just a regular panic attack. 




 Gracias por su ayuda! 




 It's good advice but I've learned as I get older that nobody really follows it.  People get lonely yo. 




 Someone accused me of stalking in another post.

The compulsion comes from human nature.  I don't obsess over my ex or even dwell on it.  I randomly clicked a link and there I was, back in the past.  

I only shared it in case someone else can relate and to show how quickly it happens.  A lot of times people treat NC as a once you do it it's a done deal type of thing when in reality people slip up all the time. 




 Wow. Sorry that you had to go through that.  I hope you're much better now. 




 I joined.  I look forward to this! 




 Yeah thanks. I haven't even bothered to read most of the other comments. I literally relapsed for the first time in over a year and I'm a stalker.  lol

I just wanted to share something with what I thought was an inclusive community... I guess I was wrong. 




 Hmm...  I feel like a Buddhist or Stoic should come in here and talk about the danger of needs and desires.
