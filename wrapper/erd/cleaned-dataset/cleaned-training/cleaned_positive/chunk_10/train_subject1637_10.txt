 Thank you, I also wish you the best too. That sounds like a great idea. I am willing to try anything. From memory my mum has a few oils, will give her a buzz and borrow some. I'm willing to try anything. I do breathing exercises which helps anxiety a bit but my depression isn't so easy today. Thank you again for your response, I really appreciate it. Feel like I'm a record on repeat, seems to happened every 6 months or so that depression gets the best of me. Was close to deleting this as I hadn't had responses. Thank you again. 




 This has helped me a lot today, Thank you. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about 15 years ago. Today isn't a good day for me, one of the many thoughts in my head is that I should "suck it up" and "other people have it worse". I know it won't last and then I'll feel silly/stupid for my mood. Want to give a shout out to my partner and family. They have gone through it all with me. Everyone deserves to be heard. 




 I have a feeling she is going to be getting a lot of attention today. Lots of hugs just to start with. Could watch her sleep all day. Thank you.
