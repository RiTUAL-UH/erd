 Not really dire at all. I'm well nourished and water is free. :p I can chill for as long as it takes. Yes, I've tried fast food, dishwasher, retail and temp. 

I wasn't really looking for sympathy with this. I was hoping to shed some light on the dynamic of mental illness combined with homelessness based on my experience and my observations of other homeless over the past two years. Thanks. 




 Thank you. 




 Urban camp is just outside the city in a park that is pretty wild. Coyotes and owls at night and only an occasional jogger in the early morning.

A local nonprofit gives me a mailing address to use and I can shower there every other day. 

There's a college nearby with public WIFI and LAN access.

I do a job search on all the major job boards, customize my resume or cover letter and sen them off. that takes two or three hours. If there is a job close by that wants applicants to apply in person, I'll go do that. Otherwise I cruise the net, do some reading or socialize at the college. 




 Communication (singular brainiac). 




 I have applied for many of these types of jobs, retail and even dishwasher. I did dishwasher as a temp and didn't mind it at all. Thing is, it is an employer's market and if I am overqualified for this type of job, they seem to want to play it safe by hiring someone who does not have upward ambitions as soon as the economy improves. I am getting help finding a job through a nonprofit agency and in theory, they should be able to help overcome this obstacle. 




 Thanks for the well wishes. I have had the help of family before but there comes a point where it becomes a burden to them and also to me for asking.

I have a fixed mailing address and have a Google Voice number with a microphone headset so I am not really disconnected in that sense. Thanks again. 




 LOL!
