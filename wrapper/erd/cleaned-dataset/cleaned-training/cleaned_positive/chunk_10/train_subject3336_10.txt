 I'm sorry you feel that way. The article was meant to open debate (hence the question of the header) and so far I'd say it's been pretty successful. Doesn't mean we have to agree. But my points are pretty concise and my opinion comes across well enough for many other's to have contacted me and discuss it. There's no need to be disrespectful.  




 Did you even read the article?!? Because there really isn't any point in having a discussion about something that I've already explained... 




 Well this is exactly what I explore in the article. Is society partly to blame, especially among young people and do we need to start taking responsibly for how the media portrays women? Personally I don't think it's a simple yes or no answer as there are many factors, this article focuses on one of those aspects. Thank you for your comment :) 




 Of course if you only read this post I would totally agree with you. Having had depression, and as you noticed my suicide attempt video I also self-harmed as a teen and now have anxiety and generally I did suffer badly from mental illness. What this post questions is could it partly stem from the way society views women. Thank you for reading xx 




 Ah well thanks for the super lovely and positive comment. I am actually trying to help people who maybe felt like I did back then and believe it or not many say I have helped them. Don't like it, don't read it.

Oh and I'm not a teen - I'm 30 years old and no longer suffer from mental illness. But who are you to say teen angst isn't a gateway to more serious problems? It is exactly because of attitudes like this that people are afraid to speak out about how they feel so thank you for proving the point of my 'whiny' blog.
