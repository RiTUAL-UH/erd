 Coming off of them was hell because you quit cold turkey. I did this a few times with SSRIs - I don't know why. My depressed brain convinced myself to quit each time. And each time I felt more depressed. 

Have you discussed these worries with your psychiatrist? They should be able to talk you through the details. Also, I have found that a little bit of medication gave me the motivation to help myself. It gave me a little boost.

Just be smart about your meds. Take it according to the prescription and notify your doctor if you want to adjust dosages or come off of it - and do it, slowly. 

Also, I find it's good to have a buddy to take the role of encouraging you with your meds. I always got to this point where I said the meds aren't working, this is stupid, I'm done taking these. So I enlisted the help of a friend to remind me to take them and to tell me it's good for me. Now I've been on them for about 8 months and my life is so much better. 

Please discuss these concerns you have with the psychiatrist. I do not believe you are in a rut because of the meds you previously took. It is probably due to the stress you have been under, and that's okay. The medication will help you be able to help yourself. 

Good luck! Stick with it.  




 I just started an internship this summer, which has been pretty huge for me. A year and a half ago I was pretty much bedridden. I would panic walking down the street. 

Anyway, I got on an SSRI, got back into school, and somehow found my way into a really great internship program. I get very anxious in new situations around new people, so it's been rough trying to adapt. 

Well, today was a sort of breaking point. I have developed some sort of claustrophobia and of course, I pick a job where I occasionally need to work in the company data center. Unfortunately this is in a highly secured room so I need an escort, and it's in a basement area. For some reason when I can't see windows or the outside, I get very, very nervous. 

So, I really panicked. I felt like I was going to pass out. My face was bright red, I was sweaty, I felt cold and hot all at once, my heart was racing, I felt like I couldn't breathe. This lasted probably 20 minutes, on and off. Sort of like waves of panic and anxiety. At a certain point I think my body was exhausted. I couldn't really panic anymore, I didn't have the energy to do it. I had this moment of clarity...I CAN handle anxiety. I can manage it, even in front of people. I didn't have to leave the space I was in. I just rode it out, and eventually my panic subsided. 

I don't really like the advice to focus on your breathing to calm yourself. This always made me feel worse and feel like I was hyperventilating. I think the best thing for me is to just say, well, this is temporary. It will eventually go away regardless of what you do. 

I'm writing this for anyone who has work anxiety. My anxiety is the worst when I'm in a space I am socially expected to stay in - like meetings, for example. Or even when I'm out with people at a restaurant. I still don't go to movie theaters because I simply can't sit still or focus on the movie. 

I like to think of it as if I'm forcing my body to stay in a certain situation to prove to it that it is NOT life threatening. I get nervous and want to run - like in a meeting - but I force my body to sit still. Yeah, I fidget a lot, move my hands, whatever. But it's a start. 

So I guess what I mean by this is it's good for me to feel the anxiety because I can convince my body to finally relax. I just wanted to share that with you guys!  




 What are you doing currently? 




 Depression is such a mystery to me sometimes. There are days where I feel amazing, and then days where I feel so horrible I don't know what to do with myself. I have to remind myself that I have progressed. 

I wouldn't consider it a battle against yourself. Your depression is certainly a part of your life but it doesn't define you. It's a battle against your depression - which can feel like losing an uphill battle. 

What I think I'm going to start doing is making a jar where each day I write something positive about myself and about my life. Something small, like, I enjoyed the beautiful weather today. Depression makes us pick out the negative in our lives so that we forget the positive things. Then, when I'm feeling depressed, I'll read through these and try to remember how I felt when I wrote them down. I'm hoping that will help me get through bad times.  




 Haha right?! Now when I fuck it up I'm like screw it, it's an egg scramble. 




 Sure! I'm taking 50mg of sertraline which is a fairly low dose. I started out at 25mg, they increased me to 50mg and I started seeing improvements. I started on medication and decided to stick with it because I wanted to pass my semester. I had previously dropped out of school and I really wanted to finish my degree. I experience a lot of classroom anxiety so I would avoid going to class. On the sertraline, boom, anxiety in the classroom gone. It took me about 3 months to get to that point - so give your medication time to work.

I had no weight gain on the medication at all. In fact, it has probably helped my eating habits because I used to binge eat when I was very depressed. I have since stopped doing that. 

The side effects I do experience are issues acheiving orgasm. Possible TMI but last time I attempted an orgasm it took me 45 minutes! I still experience sexual satisfaction with my partner but I have just accepted that it will be more difficult for me now. I also experienced mild nausea when I first started taking the pills but that went away within a week. 

My advice - stick with it. SSRIs need a few months to kick in. But they gave me that little boost. I still struggle with depression - it isn't a magic cure all - but it seriously helped me. Go with what your doctor recommends. Good luck! 




 I used to do this when I lived in Chicago. I was going on the train with my friend one time, and she's like, "What the fuck are you doing? Let people off first." It was a huge realization. I don't know why the fuck I tried to shove my way in before.  




 Yes, it's a way to help depression without medication, or alongside it. You basically retrain your way of thinking by recognizing irrational thoughts. [Here](http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-The-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336) is a link to it! 




 I couldn't make an omelette. It sent me into a horrible depression that lasted nearly the entire day. At the end of the day I was laughing about it! I still can't make a fucking omelette. 




 It's such a great feeling when you start helping yourself! We're all proud of you! 




 I do sigh a little every time I see the advice of "volunteer." It's so common when people are depressed. The idea is that if you have people who rely on you, you will build self-esteem and confidence. What happened to me, is I volunteered to teach English as a second language. I had to go into someone's home and help them with English. It was a really stressful situation. I had a lot of anxiety and I ended up quitting it because it made me feel guilty all the time!

It's not bad advice, but it's not the depression cure all people want it to be.  




 It is a scary road! Take small steps. Hopefully you'll see a lot of these ideas aren't actually scary, and can make you feel better! 




 Why do you think you will ruin someone else's happiness? 

I think that feeling is probably a reflection of what your mom has taught you - that you somehow affect her feelings (i.e. your depression makes her feel unhappy so it must be your fault).

It's not healthy to think that way, and it probably contributing to a lot of your depression. If you haven't looked into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) I would google it. One of the main concepts of CBT is that we process events and our brain decides how to respond to it. Do you notice how certain people respond differently to events? For example, say you did poorly on a test. I might respond by thinking that I'm a failure. This thought leads to feeling very depressed. This leads to me avoiding that class, subsequently doing worse and worse and confirming my belief that I'm a failure.

Now, take someone else who is maybe more positive. They do poorly on the test. They say, well, it was really hard and I didn't study as much as I should have. So they think, it doesn't mean I'm a bad person or a failure. I just need to study more. So they keep going to class, take good notes, and study for the next test, and do well. Do you see where I'm going with this?

In the case of your mom, she reacts to the event of you being depressed or unhappy. She thinks, what happened to my happy boy? She probably thinks, maybe it's my fault he feels this way. I must be a terrible mother. These thoughts make her feel awful and depressed. She thinks, if only he was happy, I would be happy too. He's making me unhappy. 

BUT, if you look at this situation, SHE made herself unhappy by these thoughts. Not you. It's important to remember that. Don't let others make YOU feel like YOU made them feel a certain way. That was a big breaking point in my depression. It made me relax a bit. If someone is upset, that's their problem, not mine. I can't fix it. I didn't make them upset. 

If possible, I would look into therapy. If you can't afford therapy or don't want to, look into books on CBT. I like Feeling Good. I look at it from time to time. You can't change your family and how they react to you, but you can change how YOU react to what they say. You don't need to feel guilty for your depression because you did not choose to have it. 

I am on an SSRI and I have found that incredibly helpful. You can see a primary care physician and they will usually prescribe you an SSRI. If you're open to medication I would look into it! 

Good luck! 




 I'm glad you liked it!  




 Well, do you want to go out and do things? I guess it would be helpful to figure out why you don't want to. My reasons for not doing things is because I assumed something negative would happen or I wouldn't enjoy myself. I really just had to lower my expectations or try to find something positive about the experience. I really don't like going out to restaurants with other people - it makes me feel very anxious and typically I feel like I can't eat anything. But I try to focus on when I *did* enjoy going out. What did I like about it? I liked talking with others and figuring out who they are. I liked talking about movies and books. Sometimes I just have to pretend. 

A lot of the time, even after going out, I have to force myself to think of something positive. I think a lot of my problem is 1, anticipatory anxiety of the event, which leads to 2, experiencing anxiety during the event, which leads to 3, viewing the event as negative and confirming that I just should not go out and I will never enjoy it. 

Accepting you may not like to go outside and it might not be fun, I think, makes it easier. When I was younger I used to have the persona of the negative, angry one of the group. I would be sarcastic and make jokes. I think this was a self-defense mechanism I was using because I was anxious. By joking around and being sarcastic, and being negative about being out, made it much easier to enjoy myself. 

As far as tactics, it really depends on what it is. I find that sitting and meditating for 10-20 minutes has helped my overall anxiety and ability to adapt to certain situations. I have created a sort of imaginary place of relaxation in my head. No one else can get there, and it's very green, sunny, but shaded with trees, and I imagine myself floating down a small river by canoe. I always imagine this scenario in any case where I am stressed out. I think bringing back this image over and over again strengthens it's relaxation response in my head. So, it might be worth a try. 

Another thing would be to forgive yourself if you don't want to go out. You don't HAVE to. I remember I told my therapist I was worried because I didn't have many friends. He said, why do you need friends? Well, I would feel normal if I had a lot of friends. We worked on it and I realized, I don't have a lot of friends because I simply don't want a lot of friends. I'm fine with my family and my SO and my pets. I wasn't trying to get more friends because I wanted it, it was because I felt like maybe I would more mentally normal if I did. 

Another thing would be simply repetition to get your mind used to going out. What kinds of things did you used to enjoy? Shopping? Going to restaurants? Going for a walk? Do those things a few times a week. Don't have any expectations. Allow yourself to hate it if you want. I find that the more I do something, the more and more I am comfortable with it. I might not love it. But I don't experience anxiety after a while. 

I hope that makes sense! 




 Well you have a bunch of options too if you didn't learn much in college. You could learn a trade, apply for a different type of job - a lot of places only require a bachelor's degree and you can pretty easily get into another career, you could go for a totally different degree, get a master's, or join the military! Just know that with the military, you're stuck there for 4 years. I know my ex loved the brotherhood aspect. He really missed it when he got out. He had ADD so it was a good environment for him. 

That's pretty awkward about your mom saying what happened to her "happy boy." She sounds a bit self-centered. Maybe she's trying to guilt you into feeling better by telling you those things. Maybe she blames herself a bit too for how you feel, and is acting out because of that. 

What does your dad say? Do you have another relative you can talk to? I know when I was going through my divorce I could NOT talk to my mom at all about it. She had zero sympathy for me and was really mean, so I started talking to my aunt. She was a lot better to talk to and she let me vent without judging me. My ex cheated on me and my mom would find a way to tell me it was MY fault because I didn't choose the right guy to marry. Wat. 

I would skip trying to get your mom to understand unless you can convince her to stop guilting you because she makes you feel WORSE. I would just tell her you know, you don't HAVE to be social all the time. You don't HAVE to be happy just for her sake. Honestly her behavior kind of sets off a lot of red flags for me! She sounds like a lot to deal with even if she is well-meaning.  




 Dunno why you were downvoted, that's great advice.  




 For breakfast, I eat 2-3 eggs, scrambled, which cooks up in less than 3 minutes. I put this over whole-wheat toast. Lately I've been heating up some canned diced tomatoes - the italian style - and putting that over the eggs. 

If you really don't have time in the morning, hard boil some eggs ahead of time and eat 2-3 in the morning with some salt. 

Sometimes I'll eat some avocado and salsa too.  




 When my stomach acts up I eat a lot of soup. Chicken with veggies in chicken broth does the trick. You could throw some rice in there too, or egg noodles.  




 I can't imagine this not being filling. 




 Yay! I'm glad! 




 You guys are cute. Firstly - stop thinking he saved your life. Give yourself some credit girl. You two have helped each other, but it's what you do in your own brain that helps you feel better. 

I think you just have a lot of issues with self-esteem. That's something that you have to learn - how to learn to be okay on your own. Let's say he did leave you for someone prettier - why would that upset you so much? If he was the kind of person to leave you for a prettier girl, is he the kind of guy you want? 

People can add happiness to your life, but people come and go. You can only truly rely on you. You say he is your number 1 in your life...well, YOU should be your number one. Focusing on yourself, bettering yourself, trying to make yourself happy - that is a very attractive trait to have. And if he does leave you, or your relationship ends for some reason, don't sweat it. You're 18. When I was 18, I thought I had found my soul mate. I married my high school sweetheart. By the time I turned 23 I was divorced. I don't regret it, because it made me learn a few things about life. Just relax, have fun with him, and if you go to college, and things change, don't worry about it. 

If you feel bad for venting, try venting to someone else. I felt a little bit like this with my current partner. It just went away with time really - and the time that I do spend with my partner I want to be a positive experience. I rant a little bit but I don't let it take up our whole time together, you know?

Good luck! You're young. Work on improving your self-esteem and doing YOU for YOU rather than someone else.  




 Oof. I feel you on the "didn't want to be dragged down with me," story. I had an ex-husband who dealt with my depression by cheating on me and telling me he was going to "help" my mental problems by leaving me. Now that I think about it, my first boyfriend broke up with me after I confided in him that I was very depressed - all the way back in middle school. That sucked!

As far as the army goes, obviously your parents care about you and infantry can be dangerous. Having been married to someone in the military, I would definitely suggest looking into a job that will prepare you more when you get out - like intel. Your parents may not like it, but it's your life. Talk to people in the army and figure out if it would be right for you. 

Why are you worried telling your parents about "the truth"? Do you think they won't believe you? I think opening up about how you feel would do you a world of good. Make an appointment with a therapist. You can just go one time if you wanted. Tell your cat, or your dog. I do this sometimes - I probably would seem crazy to someone else, but I will tell my cat my problems if I don't want to tell someone else. 

Out of all of the people I have told about my depression, maybe 5% of them reacted in a way I would deem negative. Most people understand or want to help. Sure, my ex-husband was kind of a bastard, but he doesn't define everyone. My parents took a while to get on board, and I still don't think my dad fully understands, and my mom keeps telling me my anxiety will go away if I do a cleanse because a nurse told her that once, but at least they know. And they care. Maybe they give me misguided advice sometimes, but it's something.  




 I totally feel you. What I started doing was going on Khan Academy and doing the really easy math problems. It keeps my brain going and makes me feel good about myself. Or, I'll go on Code Academy and do some of the easy stuff like HTML/CSS and Javascript. It's nice, easy, and relaxing.

I used to bog myself down with "I should" thoughts, like, "I should have a degree by now," or "I should be more into politics," or "I should watch all of these boring documentaries so I can tell people about them and they will think I'm smart." It sucks because it makes me feel guilty about what I am doing. But I would say, open your eyes a bit more to the people around you. What do they do? When I was in a deep depressive period everyone around me seemed successful. Everyone had PhDs from Harvard and were curing cancer. Once my depression got better I realized that my brain was just foggy - some people are really successful, but the majority are like us - they have no idea what they are doing. A ton of my friends don't have college degrees. Or they have a kid they can't afford. Or they had to declare bankruptcy. Or they got laid off. Or they have an amazing degree and have an amazing job but they hate it. So opening your eyes to the reality of people's lives around you is a good exercise. And stop looking at people's Facebook pictures and getting depressed - people show you what they want you to see and nothing else (I still do this, guilty pleasure). 

What depression is, is an exercise in feeling good about yourself independent of others.

You say society makes you feel like you are being lazy. You say you have potential, which you do. But who do you have this potential for? Is it for society, or for yourself? Depression forced me to learn how to do things that I was good at for me rather than for others. I got into baking recently. I do it because I love kneading bread. I cook bread in a cast iron dutch oven so that when I open the oven and peak in to see the bread it looks magical and crispy and wonderful. I don't even want to eat the bread - once it's out of the oven I'm over it. My freezer is filled with uneaten bread. I don't know what to do with it. My SO tells me I'm nuts. But I don't bake bread for other people. I don't do it to show off my baking skills. No one is really going to see my bread. I don't need to prove to anyone that I'm good at it. For all I know I could be horrible at it. I don't care. If I started baking bread for family members or to prove I can make wonderful tasting bread, I would start to despise it almost immediately. I would get extremely anxious about it. If I baked a loaf that didn't turn out right, I would probably have a mental breakdown and cry for a few hours. But when I bake bread for me...if I open up the oven and it looks wonky, I'll say to myself, "Hm. Well that's interesting." And move on with my life. 

Tell your depression to fuck off. It's okay if you don't leave the house all day. It's okay if you sleep a lot. Forgive yourself. Once you lose some of that guilt I think your true potential will shine through. Good luck! 




 Oooh I love Adriene! 




 How much is the basmati rice you buy? I love basmati rice but at my grocery store it's really expensive.  




 Wow that sounds excellent! I'm gonna try this.  




 How do you get them for free? 




 I think there will probably be times when I don't want to shave my legs, so I think I'll invest in some decent pantyhose for that occasion. Thanks! 




 Wow thanks for all the great info. I'll look into Silkies and Shapings. Thanks! 




 LOL omg. Okay...so I'm not gonna wear them. My mom was the one who told me to wear them in the first place! She's crazy. 




 These are such beautiful pieces of clothing, but why are they so expensive :( I need to dress business professional for work and I'm super broke from buying clothes. Ugh. 




 I was also equally clueless but my parents were very helpful. What you can do is, there should be a number on your insurance card, or a website you can visit. From there, you can tell them you need to find a general practitioner in your area, tell them you want a female, and they should be able to provide you with a list of doctors within a certain area that are in your network. 

I did this when looking for a psychologist - the guy on the phone actually emailed me a list of people I could see which was incredibly helpful. However, it depends on your insurance. 

Alternatively, you could just call up a doctor, or a hospital, tell them you want to find a female doctor/make an appointment, and the receptionist should be able to help you find someone. However, then you need to make sure they accept your insurance. 

Check your insurance card! Let us know how it goes :) This is such a common question. I was just telling my parents the other day they should teach us this crap in school!!!

EDIT: Once you've been given a list of people in your network, just call them and tell them you are a new patient. They should tell you if they are or aren't accepting new patients - some doctors aren't. Sometimes they will list that information online too...it's a long process but hopefully when you find a good doctor you can stick with them for a while! 




 I love how much Beyonce is on this list haha! 




 So I start a new job where I need to dress business professional. I've never really dressed for a business environment so this is my first foray into heels and pantyhose. 

Problem: so I wore pantyhose to my interview and thank god I waited to go to the bathroom until after the interview because after I tried to pull them up I ripped them. I thought, well, I was just too rough, next pair I get I'll be gentle and it will be fine. NOPE. I wore these pantyhose for like maybe three hours, and they have holes already by my knees and heels. What the fuck? These things are the most fragile things and it looks SO horrible to have a hole in your pantyhose. 

So what am I supposed to do? Am I just buying shit pantyhose? How much are they supposed to cost? I spent 7 dollars on each pair. It's so fucking aggravating. The holes I got in my pantyhose today weren't even from anything...I was sitting for like 90% of that time. I just can't afford to go through all these fucking pantyhose! 

My mom tells me I should wear tights, but that just reminds me of being a little kid, you know? I want nice, sheer pantyhose - can I get that in tights? 

Anyway, thanks for the help ladies!

EDIT: Do I even need to wear pantyhose? My mom was convinced I need to wear them, but now she says her friends who work in an office don't wear them - she said, and I quote, "They're old school." Thanks mom. So can I get away with wearing a business skirt and jacket combo without the pantyhose? Thanks!! 




 That's great! I wouldn't be able to sit through my classes without it. I'm a returning adult student and I have done better this semester than ever before. I'm also starting a new job and I'm so glad I have the Zoloft to help me. It's really made me realize that the only thing holding me back was my anxiety. It's a great feeling. 




 I'm on 50mg of Zoloft, and its great. I had no side effects except for nausea, which has since gone away. I also take it at night which helped the nausea in the beginning. I had no sexual side effects, which I had with Paxil. I find that the Zoloft really helps quiet my mind. I had bad anxiety in public and it helped quiet the anxious thoughts so I can just focus. 

Think positively and give it a chance. It's not going to work immediately, it took me about a month to see a significant change.

Good luck! And if it doesn't work out, once you hit 18 you can try something else.

 




 No, it happens at home as well, but its worse when I'm out with others. 




 As long as I can remember I have had issues with eating and anxiety. When I was a kid I would hate going to restaurants because I would feel sick, not eat very much, and would go to the restroom multiple times to try to calm down. I also remember my first bad panic attack was right after I had eaten dinner.

I have been to a few doctors and a gastroenterologist. I was put on an acid reducer and they told me I just had acid reflux. I started on an SSRI and thought it would help my stomach problems, but it hasn't. I get really nervous going out to dinner because I know I'm going to either experience a panic attack or severe anxiety. I feel extremely hot and sometimes feel like I have to go the bathroom. 

I started thinking maybe I had some food allergy or intolerance, and so my doctor put me on a liquid diet for 3 days. I felt better and then started an elimination diet, but as soon as I started eating food again my symptoms came back. They say when you do the elimination diet you're supposed to feel better and better, but I never felt better. I tested different foods and nothing seemed to cause problems specifically - just eating alone made me feel bad. 

So what's the deal? I haven't been able to figure this out and it sucks. I hate feeling so anxious from food. I don't know if it's a physical reaction like a food intolerance or just a mental response. I've also been tested for celiac and the test was negative - I cut out gluten for 2 weeks on my elimination diet. So I'm at a loss. I've had this problem as long as I can remember.  




 Haha thanks! I love burritos. 

I was considering seeing a derm - not sure about finances but I think my insurance should cover most of it. Are there any side effects to the Clindamycin? 




 I have heard of this study before. What's weird is that I was on a ketogenic diet (20g of carbs or less a day) for three months to lose weight. I didn't notice any change in my acne. I wonder if I would need to continue the low-carb diet for long? Or maybe some other food is at play here... 




 Hm...well I did include them one by one, and they do help - for a while. But like I said, every few weeks I'll have bad skin. Is it possible the products could cause this? I assumed products that clog my skin would consistently clog my skin.

What products would you recommend I cut? I didn't have my AHA toner for a few days and my skin was just awful, so I don't want to cut that. But I could experiment going with the snail bee essence, because I'm not sure it really does much. 




 Hi everyone! Here is my routine:

**AM:**

* Rinse face with water
* Silk Naturals Super Defense Serum
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion
* Cerave PM
* Biore Watery Essence Sunscreen

**PM:**

* Double cleanse with sunflower oil and Cerave Foaming Cleanser
* Sometimes cleanse again with Neem Oil
* Silk Naturals AHA (wait 20 minutes)
* Stridex in the red box (wait 20 minutes)
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion
* Cerave PM

I occasionally use sheet masks and do a mint julep mask once or twice a week. If I have acne flare ups I will use a benzoyl peroxide cream (5% or 10%). 

So my skin seems to be affected by some factors I haven't figured out yet. I have followed this routine for over six months. It has really helped my skin texture. However, I will have great skin for a while, and then I will have 5-6 active pimples or closed comedones will randomly appear. These will last a week or two, and then my face will recover. 

So, what am I missing? My diet is fairly consistent (I don't eat great, but I'm on a college budget), and I drink water. Nothing seems to change from one week to the next. My flareups don't coincide with my periods either, and I'm on birth control (which hasn't really helped my acne in any way, but hasn't made it worse). So what factors am I not considering? What else can I add to my routine? Should I look into possible food triggers? 

My mother was telling me that she thinks it's because I drink a lot (I drink probably 3-4 nights out of the week, but never to excess), and I also eat a lot of carbs. Could this be a factor? I am a healthy weight despite my crap diet haha. 

Anyone have any advice? I would greatly appreciate it!!! 




 If you don't want to spend money on a test, you can do an elimination diet at home. [This](https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/sites/default/files//webfm-uploads/documents/outreach/im/handout_elimination_diet_patient.pdf) is the document my doctor gave me.

As you can see, you essentially eliminate all possible allergens or intolerances from your diet. No alcohol, no caffeine, no corn, no wheat, no dairy, etc etc. You are extremely limited in what you can eat. After you practice this diet for 2 weeks, your symptoms should disappear. Then, you can add in certain foods that are common triggers. I.e. dairy.

It's very comprehensive. And, except for buying food, it's free! You just get to experiment with your body. And, hopefully you can pinpoint what foods trigger skin problems.

Good luck! You can PM me for more information, especially on what foods you should eat. 




 Oh okay, I'll try the oil - I don't ever spray with oil. And I'll try doing the bulk ferment in the fridge. How long is too long in the fridge? If I go longer than 48 hours is that bad? 




 Okay cool. Next time I bake I will try this! 




 How do you cover the dough to prevent it from drying out? Or should I just not leave it out overnight to prevent that? Thanks! 




 Wow okay, weird. I know some recipes say to bulk ferment in the fridge, but I figured this recipe would be easier. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks! 




 I made this basic sourdough loaf with this recipe that I got [here](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/basic-sourdough-bread-recipe). I mixed it up at night (around 9PM), kneaded it until window pane, and then set it up in a proofing basket above my fridge which is a good 70-75 degrees. I covered it in plastic wrap and went to bed.

When I woke up this morning, the dough had expanded over the proofing basket. It had this weird crust on it even though the plastic wrap was on it. Inside the crust the dough look strange - like my sourdough starter does. It looked like the gluten development had broken down overnight. 

Did I use too much sourdough starter? My starter has been particularly active lately. I ended up punching down the dough and reshaping the loaves. The bread was alright, but the crumb was very dense - probably from the second reshaping I assume.

So where did I go wrong? I was really confused that my dough had the hard crust on it - I assumed the plastic wrap was very air tight. 

Thanks for the help!

 I've dealt with depression for about 8 years now. I have been on and off different SSRIs. Currently I take 50mg of Sertraline, and have been on it for about 6 months. I have improved, and for some reason because I have improved my psychiatrist has stopped increasing my dosage. Is this normal? 

I don't see a therapist currently. I saw many therapists in the past but I really don't enjoy it, don't like spending the money, and never found it to be very helpful. 

I have made a few life changes within the past year - I got out of a bad relationship, changed career paths, have become very successful in school, and have made a few friends and become more social. 

But I do all of these things and still feel very, very depressed. I'm getting scared that I will be like this forever. I have developed a lot of fears over the years - planes, illness, death, driving with other people, restaurants, large crowds, needles. The list of the things I'm afraid of keeps getting bigger. I don't know what to do. I'm stressed all the time and I don't know how to relax - typically I only really relax if I'm drinking a lot. 

What other things can I do to get better? Will I always be depressed?  




 Wow, you look great. How did you get past your depression without medication? I have been on an anti-depressant for about half a year now and have noticed some improvements, but I still struggle with a lot of the physical symptoms of depression and anxiety. I have really bad days still. How did you motivate yourself to go to the gym?  




 Awesome! My family owns a business that employs a lot of mechanical engineering interns. I'm taking a mechanical engineering course as a gen ed req and it's pretty interesting. I actually really like 3D modeling too! 




 What kind of engineering? 




 I switched out of English to Comp Sci. Everyone is like, oh, you must have needed more of a challenge. No. English was so terrifying for me. I did well, but it was stressful, and my god the papers. Comp Sci is hard but at least I enjoy doing it.  




 Depression is serious, please get help. Your school probably has great resources for mental health. At my school I got into counseling and got prescribed an SSRI. I'm doing so much better and I have my school to thank!

A part of working through depression is being okay with failure or admitting you need help. Is there a classmate you could ask to help you? 

Let me know if you need help with anything! I don't know much about electronics but I'm pretty well versed in what depression can do to someone. PM me if you want!! 




 What subject? I'm studying computer science so I feel the same way sometimes. 




 I totally know how she feels, I always think mechanics will think I'm stupid or take advantage of me. I don't know anything about cars! 




 Awesome!! Thanks for the info. 




 Wow, they're beautiful!  




 I use about 10oz starter to 4oz water and 4oz flour. So I need to reduce the amount of starter or increase flour and water to hit your percentages? 




 Hmm I don't really know what that gak feels like, but I may need my starter to be thicker. Thanks for the info! 




 Thanks, I'll try that. I wonder why it would be affecting it now, when before the starter was doing well. 




 I measure by weight, 4oz water to 4oz flour. What should the consistency of the starter be? 




 I've had a starter for about a month now. About two weeks ago I put it in the fridge and only fed it about four times, so twice a week.

Before I had it on the counter and it was doubling between feeds and was nice and bubbly.

So I want to do some baking so I put it out on the counter, and now I'm feeding it twice a day with AP flour and water from the tap. Its bubbling and has a great smell, but its not rising. The temperature in my kitchen varies, but for the last two days its been generally 75 degrees because I was cooking a lot.

What other things could I be doing wrong? Should I keep feeding it twice a day or once a day? I started giving it some rye flour because I heard that helps.

Thank you!!! 




 Flair. 




 I don't know why people are even trying to argue this. It is weird as shit to eat the skin of an onion, literally no one does that. 




 Because they don't give a shit and short hair is less maintenance. 




 Tetris is always fun! 




 I like this idea! I'm going to try it next time I'm anxious! 




 You have a few options. Are you doing anything currently to help reduce it? 

I like Amlactin lotion or the new Gold Bonds Rough and Bumpy Lotion. You need to keep up a constant routine to keep it at bay. I use exfoliating gloves on my KP and then use a moisturizer like Amlactin. Keeping the area shaved, exfoliated, and moisturized will help reduce its appearance. 

You can also do a sub search for more information. 




 I've been hearing about how different products treat acne at different levels of the skin. How accurate is this? So I'm using an AHA now and I'm getting a few whiteheads popping up, and I read that those are pimples that were just below the surface, but if I want to treat all of the underlying acne I need to add a retinoid. So...will I still get acne even using an AHA and BHA? It grosses me out thinking about acne lying underneath the surface of my skin.  




 I really think it depends on your skin. I think a lot of the time when people argue against lots of products, it's because if they did use a bunch of products one of them was probably causing breakouts/irritation. More products = more chances of your skin responding poorly, especially if you have sensitive skin.

My routine is pretty long because I have lots of things I want to fix. Layering products has helped not only with my acne and skin texture, but my skin is so hydrated and I never have issues with dryness or oilyness like I did before when I did nothing for my skin. 

Skin is very personal. I use lots of different products and it works good for me because I have slowly added them in - it's taken maybe half a year to get to this point? Some people want a short, quick routine, and that's fine!  




 I would try switching toothpastes, the SLS in regular toothpaste can cause some people to breakout.  




 I don't really feel like it's excessive. If you love makeup and you've been collecting makeup for a while, it makes sense to have that much. I like these kinds of videos.  




 That's so great. I'm glad you're mentioning therapy. I gained about 40lbs post divorce and I was eating and drinking to cope. I went to therapy, started on medication, changed some things about my life, and I am in such a better place and I lost the weight! 

Even mild depression benefits from therapy and medication.  




 That's scary!! Good job on being such an inspiration! 




 It sounds good, if a bit pricy. You can look products up on cosDNA for potential irritants or acne issues.

I've heard Nivea creme is great, not sure about availability though. If you are purchasing online you could get Cerave as well, I find it very affordable. 




 To repair your barrier, check out [this](http://blog.skincare-addiction.com/barrier/) link on the subreddit blog. 

I would caution against using an AHA if you want to repair your barrier. As the article I linked suggests, use a gentle cleanser, moisturize, and wear sunscreen everyday. 

For product recommendations, I use Cerave PM which is excellent. It has niacinamide in it which will help with PIH. I have also used the Cerave moisturizer that comes in the tub and I quite like that as well. I have started using the Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion (you can find it at Walgreens in the US) in addition to the Cerave PM and it's quite moisturizing. 

You can find more product recs for moisturizer in the sidebar, I personally love Cerave but people sensitive to fatty alcohols should avoid it. I also used to put a thin layer of Vaseline over my moisturizer at night - this seals in moisture and helped keep me hydrated during the harsh winter months.  




 It is hilarious to me that the classification of ponchos causes offense. Controversy on /r/knitting lol! 




 What is it then? Looks like a poncho to me. 




 How did you get into lifting weights? I'm a woman who wants to start but I'm very intimidated by the gym for anything other than an elliptical. 




 Okay, I'll work up slowly instead of switching to everyday right away. I'm thinking every other day should be OK. 




 Thank you!!! I only ask because I was using Alpha Hydrox as my AHA and it broke me out. I initially thought I was just purging but it was causing acne in weird places :( 




 Here's my routine:

**AM**

* Rinse Face
* Silk Naturals Super Serum 
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion
* Mizon All-In-One Snail Repair Lotion
* Cerave PM OR Cerave in the tub (I have both)
* Neutrogena Dry Touch SPF 30

**PM**

* OCM with mineral oil 
* Cleanse with Cerave Foaming
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel 
* Stridex pads in the red box - wait 20 minutes
* Silk Naturals 8% AHA - wait 20 minutes
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion
* Mizon All-In-One Snail Repair Lotion
* Cerave PM
* If skin needs it, light layer of vaseline

I introduced everything one product at a time and patch tested everything. I'm going to be replacing my sunscreen once it's out with something that has a higher SPF and that isn't so greasy.


Questions:

1.) How often should I be using the 8% AHA? I have a small sample bottle that I have been using sparingly about 3 times a week. I've ordered the full bottle and once I get it, should I use it every day? I currently use the Stridex everyday with no issues and no dryness. 

2.) How is my order? Do I need to wait at all after applying the Super Serum? My motivation for this product is to reduce the appearance of acne scarring and improve my skin's appearance - has anyone had any success with this serum?

3.) Whenever I apply literally anything on my neck I get acne. It's really annoying. Is it okay to just leave this area alone and only apply sunscreen? Products that are fine on my face do not work well on my neck - so I assume it's too sensitive. 

4.) I got this patch of acne on my butt region. I applied Stridex immediately after I noticed it, and the acne went away pretty much overnight. Now I am left with red bumpiness that isn't going away. What's the deal? I apply Alpha Hydrox lotion to my body, so if I put it on my butt will it help at all? I shower everyday and exfoliate the area. 

5.) I woke up today with a pimple by my eyebrow, and I was really excited because it's been a small bump forever and I believe the AHA caused the pimple to surface. So my question is, how long do people normally purge with an AHA? 

I know that's a ton of questions, but I'd really appreciate some insight! I think I'm really close to having a perfect routine for my skin.  




 I have one of these masks on right now haha! My skin doesn't mind it. And I like the smell! 




 So I started using the silk naturals AHA toner every other day, in addition to my Stridex pads every day. I've been breaking out, which I assume is purging. How long should this go on before I stop breaking out? I'm wondering how long I should continue to use the product. I am not breaking out horribly, maybe 3-4 small whiteheads you can barely see. 

I'm using up the sample bottle of it and I'm wondering if I should invest in the large bottle. My skin texture has definitely improved but like I said I have a few whiteheads in areas where I normally get acne. Thanks! 




 I'm not sure about the zinc oxide and the propylene glycol. Or sulfur actually! They have mostly similar ingredients - like the bentonite. I would just experiment. You can look up ingredients on cosDNA to see about any irritants.  




 Do you have any info on ingredients in the Walgreens brand masque? I looked it up and could not find anything. There is probably a difference - check ingredient lists.  




 That is...disgusting.
