 Really love her stomach piercings, they flow so naturally :D Wonder how badly those dermals hurt though.... 




 Nick Tahous baby, that's where it's at.  




 In-ground pool.


I don't wanna clean that shit just so I can float in it for two hours every summer, then have to hire someone to fill it in when I eventually, most likely attempt to move and sell the house. 




 Holy shit man. There are some things that people shouldn't ever have to see, sorry you ever had to see that. 


Not gonna lie, thought you bailed on us (not that I blamed you, there was some serious reddit-mobage going on). All I gotta say is thanks, for both the perseverance and the foresight to preview the tapes instead of showing live like most wanted, and for coming back to explain as much as you could anyway, even though i'm sure it's probably something you'd rather hand off to the cops and bleach from your brain. 


Take care of yourself. This is the sort of shit that makes people crazy. And as far as all the downvoting goes, don't let it get to you. People sometimes tend to mix up "Imaginary sorting system" with "Cocaine laced with gold". 


Thanks again OP, you did good :) 




 I'm so sorry to hear about your situation, hopefully it's gotten better since. You should try drawing again though,  even unfinished ones have a kind of charm to them :)  I haven't heard of deltoras quest though, is that a tv show?
 




 Guitar is definitely...interesting.  But it's one of those things where everyone starts on equal terms, talent doesn't have nearly as much importance as practice and perseverance. It makes it much more satisfying :)  




 Haha the irony being I'm actually dyslexic xp thanks for taking the time to check them out, I'm glad you enjoyed them!
