 Thank you for sharing. I know from experience that making that step to seek help is REALLY hard but it's amazing that you managed to help so many others too.

You are a great positive force to have on r/depression. :) thanks again 




 I'm here if you need a friendly ear :) 




 Naww thanks that's really sweet! I am also a bit of a nut and love random love from the internet :P 




 Thanks! That's not really my opinion though :P

The stories are coming well - finished the first draft of my first book and I'm editing it atm. It's going well! :) Thanks for taking an interest! 




 I think we've all had moments where we get to our darkest place and sometimes it's hard to get to a less dark place. I'm doing this because I think that it's important to gain techniques that can calm you down or help IN THE MOMENT.

Whether it's relaxation techniques or physical things, I think it would be a good idea to list some things that help you IN THE MOMENT to get over a bad bout of depression or anxiety. This does  NOT include self-harm, lashing out, violence or mean actions. I'm talking about positive things to feel better and sharing them with others to encourage them to get similar things and bonding over de-stressing techniques. :D

Mine are:
Phoning my SO,
Watching Star Wars,
Cuddling a teddy,
Having a cathartic cry.

What are your things? 




 The thing I'm probably the best at (cringe at the implied arrogance) is that I'm kind. Or that's what my girlfriend say. She says I'm always kind and very thoughtful.
People also say that I'm articulate - which makes me glow inside because I want more than anything to be a novelist.

p.s. this is a great idea! Getting us to try to feel positive!
