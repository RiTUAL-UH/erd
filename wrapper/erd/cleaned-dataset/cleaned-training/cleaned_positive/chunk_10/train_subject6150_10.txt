 My meta is a little goofy we have like 3 swarm players, no fat hans, 1 super dash, 1 decimator + soontir, 1 panic attack list and a guy who could bring anything. 
I have 4 lists I am thinking about bringing.

Brobots with HLC, VI, AvS and Inertial Dampeners

Bug Zapper 7x Z-95 with Feedback Arrays

BBBB with Accuracy Correctors

or Thug Lyfe 4x Y with Unhinged Astro, Ion Cannon Turret, and the title; 2 with Seismic charges
  
I am equally comfortable flying all of them. Thoughts?  




 Too lazy to link them all.
* Death for my Birthday - Say Anything
* Hurt - as sung by Johnny Cash
* Mad World - Gary Jules
* Adam's Song - Blink 182 




 This seems like a great question to pose to a medical professional. The Internet isn't always a reliable source of medical advice. 




 I am currently prescribed cymbalta and Wellbutrin. I have been taking them for 4 years now. It is very important not to miss doses of cymbalta. The withdrawl symptoms hit like a truck, for me its feel like I am drunk minus the euphoria with occasional brain zaps. I set my pill keeper on top of my cell phone every night to remind me to take them. I think the benefits outweigh the added responsibility of remembering my medication. I hope this was helpful. Good luck! 




 I have been on that specific combination, cymbalta/Wellbutrin for going on 4 years. I have been doing fairly well on it. Other than crushing my libido, It hasn't had any negative side effects. 




 If you live in the US, look into getting healthcare through the government. I was freaking out about not being able to afford my prescriptions after turning 26, the age you can no longer be on your families plan, only to find I qualified for free healthcare. talk to the therapist you choose about medication options. They can point you in the right direction. There are really no "best" medications you will probably have to try a few different combinations until you figure out what works for you. Make sure and be patient with your medications they won't fix anything instantly but, can certainly help over time! Good luck!
