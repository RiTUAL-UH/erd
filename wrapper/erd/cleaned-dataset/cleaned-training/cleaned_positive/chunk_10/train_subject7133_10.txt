 We can agree to disagree.  




 10/10  




 A little about me: 

• I'm Maddison 

• 19, Scottish

• Pansexual 

• Post rock music, reading and games are my true loves 😍 

Pm me a little bit about yourself and leave your kik :) Also, please be able to keep a conversation, I'm tired of having one sided conversations that last like 5 minutes ._. 




 That makes sense. I've felt like that sometimes too actually, especially the bit about constantly adjusting the hood! but for the most part it does help keep my anxiety rather low. 




 I'm sure I'm not the only one... hopefully anyway. 




 I'm prone to headaches, so I'll keep that in mind; thanks!  




 I do think we should just try and get hooper back, we know how he plays and we know he's got chemistry with quite a few of the other bhoys. For some reason though; Ronny is set on getting this guy :/ 




 Wurly. Definitely wurly. 




 Everything about this is adorable :3 




 Awesome! 




 I do love all their albums. But if I had to choose a favourite; it would be either be.. Severed ties or Let the ocean take me :)  




 It is indeed :) They're one of my favourite bands.  




 Block, and be more careful of who you talk to.  




 I'm 19/F (obvious, perhaps) 😅 live in the UK. I'm interested in talking to some girls who are like myself, so I figured this sub reddit would be kinda perfect for that! :) 

If anyone is, feel free to pm me/ask for my kik, whatever 😊 




 It's the longest in quite a while and I feel proud of myself, for once. 

To anyone else in recovery/trying to recover. You *can* do it

 First time in a while I've felt bad for laughing at anything on this sub - congrats OP
