 Same here. I can relate to that. I used to listen to music and would just be able to escape for a while.  I tried the other day and I really struggled with listening to music. I would turn off the music a few minutes after. Pm me if you feel like you ever want to talk to someone. 




 Am experiencing the same with ear ringing. It's irritating. :( 




 I won't do it. I've been wondering about it but now I feel a bit better with others saying no and there are options.  Thank you guys. 




 I forgot to take my anti depressant medicine and I'm already in bed. I usually take it every evening.  Should I take it now anyway?? (2am EST here) 




 I've been thinking about shaving my eyebrows off so I can grow them back and shape my eyebrows better... Has anyone have done this before? Does it help? Should I leave my eyebrows alone? 




 I'm his wife, hi :) Message me as well.

UPDATE: Tickets are sold. Apologies. 




 Thanks for sharing. Needed to read this. 




 Thanks, I'll check it out! 




 Thanks! 




 Do you melt the coconut oil first before putting it on your face to be able to wipe the makeup off? 




 I might have missed it when I was searching on reddit's search bar but because I ran out of makeup remover wipes, I was wondering what would be the best way to remove makeup? Olive oil, coconut oil, something that may be safe for me to remove makeup at home?? I have no means of transportation to buy more makeup remover wipes. (I got in a car accident, long story but I'm okay.) 




 THEY HAVE IT IN MACY'S? WHERE HAVE I BEEN? O_O

 I did it really, really light.... I was a little bit scared.  I didn't want to look really heavy with the contour.  Thank you for the feedback!! 




 Thank you!! I'll keep in mind on blending the forehead better. I'm very picky with the foundation...  I hope it's the lighting lol. Again, thank you for your wonderful comment! 




 Yes CCW :) 




 Will add products list when I can when I'm not on my phone! :)
