My boyfriend has got borderline personality disorder. He does manage relatively well on the outside. But inside of the relationship... it is hard to describe the wicked tangles of guilt and sometimes abuse that such a relationship *can* mean. I've been with him for 5 years.

**Anything I ever tried is to make him happy**. This was my goal and the intention behind everything I did and said in this relationship.  

He says that I destroyed everything he liked by not "liking it enough myself". And lying about it. Well yes I tried to like his hobby and the disgusting sexual things because I was scared that he would kill himself if I don't. But doing anything with him is difficult. He gets angry at the smallest things...   
His hobby is something creative and when I don't have an idea how to make it look better he would get angry at me for not trying hard enough and not liking it enough. Because if it would really be my hobby I would have an idea. And always want to do it even if I had a long day or should do other work. 

He can not differentiate. That you can like something at a certain time and under certain circumstances and not under different ones. That it is possible that he is important to me and at the same time I choose to study or work over doing something with him sometimes because I have to.

I am in medschool. On track to be able to choose any speciality I want. Yes I study a lot and I know this takes a toll on a relationship. He makes me feel guilty whenever I study. Or when I go home. 

The other thing is sex. I am asexual. I had no idea when the relationship started, other wise I would have *never* started it. I tried hard to like sexual things. Then I tried just to endure it. Not all asexuals are this way but for me it is like I imagine having sex with the wrong gender is for hetero or homosexual people (I don't really know how to describe it for bisexuals...).   
This is a situation that would put ever relationship on the line. Even if both parties are mentally healthy. I understand and I allowed my boyfriend to have sex outside of the relationship and he can find a new girlfriend and end things at any time. I hope he does.   

Anyway this is getting way to long. Last evening he was depressed again. I tried to be emotionally detached so that I could present a loving girlfriend and let all the insults and very hurtful things he said go over my head. We talked for about two hours... about all the things that do not work. I always tried to propose ideas on how to ensure that he would not feel like I just "played with him" anymore and how he would never feel that I am "ignoring him if he needs me". I kept that constructive sweet girlfriend persona. Screaming inside at some things he said. But I kept it together.   
And it almost worked... I proposed to try one week where I'd spent all the time possible at his place (his claim of me not having enough time for him), in which we would do a new project with his hobby (knowing that I'd have to *enjoy* it in any second he wants) and generally where I'd try to keep this persona up (of course I did not say that).   
And he agreed. With one extra demand: He wanted to do what he sexually wants. (Which is some dominant humiliating play). 

And I just lost it. All the calm, collected... I just cried at the though of having to do this again and again. And yes I blew it with this. He did not want the sex anymore seeing me crying. And went back to being totally depressed and telling me how sadistic it is of me to not allow him to kill himself.   
Fuck this shit. 

____________________________________________________________

Now I am trying to see this in perspective. My goal in life is to help people. **I will be a doctor no matter what he does and says**.   
We work together which creates some difficulties because he randomly allows me to work or not (saying that he has no obligation to allow his coworker to be at his place and block his computer, it was a lot different when we started the job) and I need his PC and software. I will only work with him until fall 2016 though. 
**Of course I tried and am still trying to get him into therapy again. He has been in and outpatient on and off for years.**

Anytime I ask for advice people tell me that I should kill him. 

Meaning to just leave him in his mess... and I honestly thought about that. But I think killing someone just to have it easier myself is wrong. Especially when my purpose is to help others (and I love medicine by the way). And just because it would be socially acceptable to end a relationship knowing that the other person would see this as a permission to kill himself.... I think it is the same as stopping CPR on a patient who still has a chance. Yes it is exhausting but my well-being can't be more important than another persons life. 

___________________________________________________

Now I am trying to decide what to do next. I basically have two **options**:  
**1. I do the sexual stuff**, don't start to cry and start a new cycle of semi-happy bf until it will be at this point again because I slipped and missed a clue on what he actually wants or do something he sees as lying or anything really.. I once brought out a mosquito in a glass and put the glass to close to the door... He scolded me for it and then got angry because I looked sad while he was saying that I am stupid... And everything was back to the beginning....  
**2. I don't do what he wants**. He would see this as me not loving him anymore... and maybe as permission to suicide. Whenever I say that I am scared that he would kill himself if I left he says that this is a challenge to him to kill himself asap while we are still together.

The **3. option** would be call the police and try to get him into a closed psych ward. No use of that. He would play sane and be out in a few weeks, definitely not trusting me anymore and ready to kill himself because he just had weeks to plan it.
_____________________________________________

**Tl;dr: Oh jeez summarizing that. Boyfriend suicidal and has borderline, wants stuff I can't give him.**  

**Do I have other options?**   
**Do you have any advice?**  ^(maybe ^other ^than ^kill ^him...)  
**Can you help me put this into perspective?**

I am trying to somehow keep a positive outlook of my life. I mean this will be over at one point. I may have killed a person with my lack of sexuality but I will be a doctor. And at one point I will live again and maybe be ok.  

I don't know if I'll be able to reply to answers...  
Thanks to everyone having read all of this.
