 Who made those shoes? If you were born into an impoverished family in a war torn nation being exploited for cheap labor and resources, you probably would know them. 




 I can't believe some of the pig faced comments posted here so far. This is as much of a tragedy as is the behavior this man was protesting. I would like to see some of the more hateful commenters perform a fraction of good this man accomplished in his life. No matter how you spin it, the fact that people are setting themselves on fire to protest injustice should tell us that we need to wake up and start living together before we all die alone. 




 May be, but his legend lives on. My neighbor is one of dozens of his grandchildren, and she has three kids of her own and even a brand new grandchild of her own. This man will truly never be forgotten in more ways than just his phenomenal blues. 




 This sounds like depression and a some kind of detachment disorder.

They will put you on Prozac. That didn't work for me. If you can afford to I would highly advise seeing a psychologist.

I might suggest some thrill seeking. I am an adrenaline junkie and get kicks from doing potentially dangerous things in a big way, and its caused me a lot of grief. Instead I had at one point immersed myself in playing enemy territory and got my fix from long killing sprees. Maybe you can find something similar that makes you feel alive.

Deep sea fishing
Snow skiing
Building stuff with power tools
Auto mechanics
Bicycling across town
Road trips to nowhere
Make bullets and shoot at a gun range

This list can go on. These are guy things I do to keep myself sane. Well, I used to but can't anymore for a couple of reasons, so what I am saying is that if I were you I'd get out there and live a little while you can, learn to love life, or one day you might be left with nothing but a bible to read. 




 My buddy's recliner needs to be replaced badly and I don't have a penny to my name or I would buy one for him off Craigslist. He is a parapalegic ball of laughs and strength in my life and I want to help him so I thought I would ask here about resources for getting him set up. He lives in a tiny apartment with an 80 year old man who we both love like a grandfather. They have a very limited and fixed income, and my buddy doesn't even have a bed to lay in. He lives in his recliner and needs a replacement that he can get some rest in so he don't have to sleep on the floor with bugs.

Any suggestions are really appreciated. This guy has shown me more hospitality than I can repay today and I just want to help him in what way I can by getting him a new chair.

I have a beat up convertible to carry the chair in, but suggestions on how to move it in a safe/legal manner are also appreciated.

Thank you Corpus Christi 




 With the US taxpayer getting frequently scammed by crooked contractors, often to the tune of billions at a time, seeing this makes me wonder at what point China will really be spending more in terms of actual productivity. 




 Ah, CCPD at its best.

I grew up there and have been arrested for no fucking reason so many times that I got so sick of being treated like I criminal that I didnt care when I actually became one.

 




 It seems logical that runaway melting of the polar ice caps at the end ot the last ice age could explain this. The timing coincides with the latest pre-history of civilization as we know it, and we do know the coastlines looked very different wih all that water being stored in collossal ice massifs. Whats more is that it follows to understand how populatiin centers are mainly located on coastlines.

Ive always considered a foregone conclusion that many ancient cities around the world have been submerged under a hundred fert of water only to be discovered long after our climate has its way with this planet.


In locating these sites one ciuld take a look at the pattrrn of building our cities near the mouhs of rivers bordering thr ocean. It would make sense to look at  such areas that at one time were promontory, scenic, or oherwise provided some level of ptacticality to build out a city.

I recently learned the Aborigines have a vey dependable method by which informatikn is passed from one generatikn to the next, and thier stories are very speciific about sea levels rising dramaticalky enough to submerge two riverc basins under several feet of water. 




 The fact that we deal in probablities goes against the notion of an infinity. Its hard for me to imagine somewhere out there all things are happening at all points in time, yet I am stuck at home with a headache trying to figure out how that's even possible. 

Another possibility is that proof is all around us that the universe is infinite, but we are simply unable to grapple with the enormity of the observation because we are monkeys.

Whats another way to substantiate an infinite universe constrained by probability? Sounds impossible (haha). 




 What happens at the center of this torus? Is it possible to make gravity work in reverse this way? Could that happen at the barycenter/horizon of merging black holes? 




 Help me understand something: how can we exist in an infinite universe when some unimaginable organization of energy, matter, and space time has not, for example, made contact with us? In such an infinitesimal universe, by its very nature there would have to be an instantiation somewhere out there that would obviate the nature of an infinite universe to us - and any other entity capable of observing anything at all.

That is to say, the universe *must* be finite because our *observations* are finite. Nothing from some otherwise theoretical part of the universe has wandered towards me, or you, or the moon, to tell us any different. Just as our existence in some hypothetically infinite universe may include our sunsets and emotions, there *must* be something out there observable by us to reinforce any theory of an infinite universe, but there is not - as evidenced by the simple fact that I am here asking you this question.

Does this make sense? I am saying there isn't another you out there *anywhere* because if there were one more, there's infinite more, and with this infinitesmal organizations thing at least one of them should be knocking at your door *right now*.

If infinite combinations of matter and energy are out there then why hasnt one of them ended the universe as we know it? The answer is because the universe must be finite - or - there are a finite number of way matter, energy, and spacetime can interact.

Either way the implication here is that one day we will truly be able to understand all this crap well enough to fly through space and time like intergalactic tourists without a care. The concept of infinity doesn't sir well with me. 




 You've hit the nail on the head. As someone coming from an IT background, the ways businesses systems work, and computers in general for that matter, are exactly as described. Defects are reported, studied, and fixed until that tendril of protocol or code is so highly tuned that they solidify into dependable construct.

In the industry we call this "Best Practice", and I can tell you from 20 years of experience developing such things that what I see in law enforcement is the exact opposite of a functional system. IT people are paid to literally solve hellaciously complex problems, and it pains me to see such an obvious need for an overhaul, especially when so much unnecessary suffering is taking place.

The situation being discussed here is what we call a "Mode of Failure", identifiable by a distinct set of circumstances with a highly predictable outcome. Unless something fundamental is changed, this is bound to repeat until the system crashes. Its that simple and this rule applies to every practical application of scientific theory out there. 




 You're looking at it. 




 So is everything else tied to transport. 




 Dear North Korea,

In response to your most recent threat of imminent war with my country, the United States of America:

We would like to see you try. Everyone here owns guns, local law enforcement wants to kick your ass so bad they are picking fights with everyone, our state police hunt down fugitives and corrupt politicians, our federal agencies know everything about you, and it would only take a single digit percentage of our military to turn your country into the world's biggest parking lot.

Your country has roughly the same population as the State of Texas, and I bet 10 of the toughest people in Texas could take out every single member of your most elite combatants. 5 of our brightest IT guys could turn your lights off forever, and just 1 of our teachers could turn your entire population against you.

Be afraid, and stay that way. You have a good reason: your biggest and best are inferior scum in the eyes of the rest of the world.

Sincerely,

A tenth generation US citizen who's ancestors have fought and won every major war his country had endured.
 




 haha.. this makes me feel good. i sense these guys arent out there filling ticket quotas. we'll see. 




 Then a patent troll ruins everything. 




 Anyone else laughing thier ass off at this? 




 All the fish are gonna die. What a bummer. At least I got pictures.
 




 Border Security is just like any other "bi-partisan" issue out there. Agencies request "ass" amount of dollars to follow through with thier proposals. The govt grants them only half of that.

Do the math and you get our current situation. 




 TIL these two fields are mutually exclusive. 




 Polar bears! I knew it.

Now that obligatory, dim-witted sarcasmism is out of the way, what more will it take for people to realize what is happening? I hate to admit that I hope the weather gets a lot worse a lot sooner so the last straw gives us a head start in fighting it all. This research obviously has financial support. Why not just divert that funding into directly combatting the scandalous bribery enabling oil cartels to do business? Instead of drilling more uselesd core samples why not line the pockets of congressmen? 




 Cognitive dissonance must be one hell of a drug. This is a very interesting discovery. 




 For the record, it has occurred to this insignificant commenter that oil spilling into aquifers is a good way to make money by selling bottled water. My uneducated ass wouldn't be surprised to see Koch Bros. brand of bottled water being sold over the Olgallalla in the accident prone future of this pipeline. 




 I wonder how many "intoxicated" first offenders he put in Williamson county jail for three years. 




 You were just given waterfront property. For free. By your father.


You want to sell it?!

Unless you have a backup plan for life in general I would suggest you keep that property and give it to your children some day. There will be water in that ground for a long time after the rest of Texas dries up.

 




 To all of you joking about this: It could happen to you or someone you love before you even wake up in the morning. You are more likely to get killed by a cop than you are to win a good chunk of any lottery.


Now let me ask you a question: How many lottery tickets did you buy last year? 




 Most people in this country live paycheck to paycheck, and the majority of those who do not are on public assistance. Requisite expenditure of limited or non-existent income on privately cntrolled interests is in no way a solution. Only a single payer system will work. Unfortunately the current healthcare regime is built upon such a deeply entrenched economic construct that upending it too quickly would be on par with taking down big banks. Too big to fail, so now we have this bastardized middle ground tilled by the right and effectively shat upon by the left.

And we here hold a proverbial, flaming bag with still no wsy, for many of us, to treat the burns. 




 He probably hasn't taken that middle school history class yet. 




 I looked up redneck on the Internet and couldn't find anything about their collective stance on police brutality. 

Can you provide us with their contact info so we can call the redneck HQ and gather a consensus? I demand accountability from this group of which you speak for their obviously biased stereotyping. The belief of infallibility in an otherwise notoriously corruptible profession is reprehensible, and we *must*, as *true Americans*, confront said ethnic group to set the record straight!

Gosh. You really have worried now. If it weren't for these *rednecks* everywhere we might have, as a country, taken a much different turn long ago. Maybe we should make them wear a red bandanna around their necks so we know who the *real* enemy is.. 




 I see a waste of good dungeon space. Why not just squish all of them into the same iron maiden at the same time? It will save on dungeon maintenance fees, and we can write it off like we bought 16 iron maidens and paid as many torturers to agitate them. The bonus is they'll die much faster so we can also save on the sewage we would otherwise feed them for however long they might survive in the individual masks.

If you want to beat these people all you have to do is think like them. The rest will come naturally. 




 People who work high up at Comcast must have the same mentality of North Korean politicians. They have to know Satan reserves a spot for them to bend over and take it for eternity if there is a hell at all, yet they continue to meet and exceed our expectations of evil incarnate. Even then, everyone literally just sits and watches it happen, mouths agape, bugged eyeballs drying, as this company redefines what it means to abuse people.

Make them pay for ads, I say. Charge people to get kicked in the groin. They'll love it, guaranteed to beg for more. 




 If I were Comcast I would personally stick my arm into the first TWC ex-customer's butt hole and squeeze their wallet, just because it isn't illegal.

It would be in the contract, okay? 

You know, the whole corporate personhood thing. Just once. Just because. Hey, if people didn't like my service they could always go somewhere else, right? 




 Your bills don't add up to anywhere near six figures.

You are paying entirely too much for your car. Buy used, pay in full, purchase liability, problem solved. With what you make you could spend ONE pay check on a nice ride. I bought a Mustang Cobra on Craigslist that's in amazing, rebuilt condition, for $5k. I have a terrible driving record and my liability insurance is only $65 a month.

You are probably paying too much for rent. Move into affordable housing, another problem solved. I found a 2br/2bath apartment within walking distance of work, had 2 roomies, and my share of the bills was $350. We spent a hell of a lot more on food. Nevertheless....

With what you make you could fix your credit outright in three years. Pay off your debts, and be honest about your spending. You don't need cable TV, an XBox or PSN subscription, or other expensive habits if you are going to act like you're hurting.

If you have such amazing experience with software architecture at the age of 23 (lol...)... write yourself a fucking app for your brand new iPhone that tracks your spending for you. I've done my share of software architecture, and believe me, if you can't track $100k of *your own money* then you probably shouldn't be designing things that crunch numbers.

That said, congrats on ditching the church. You'll only grow more wise. Being trapped by zealots is definitely going to take a while to recover from.

Welcome..to the *real*. 




 its more like a sign of an auto maker who doesn't make complete junk that is designed to break so they can sell more junk parts. 




 You bet your ass coyotes will kill cattle, especially calves. Source: I grew up on a ranch in west Texas.

The worst parr is that coyotes just eat the soft parts and leave the rest of the carcass to rot. I cant believe youd require a 'citation' for this. Go watch Animal Planet, maybe search the web for 'food chain' or even 'scavenger'. 'Troll' might help you as well. 




 Someone please fucking tell me why this is not the scariest shit imaginable. 




 I think this person is trying to portray a very warped perspective on voting vs. not voting. 




 It has to be PR. Nobody with access to that kind of wealth can be stupid enough to believe that the SA is worth donating that kind of money to. 




 Psst, you.. you *are* **Reddit**. 




 Fucked? Really? Can you elaborate?

I was planning a trip to the valley. I don't want to be so fucked for not knowing Spanish. I was under the impression that I could go the rest of my life speaking English in the US and not have to worry about getting fucked.

Do tell. 




 I bet you think DiGiorno is delivery, too.

The Salvation Army is a **for profit** company.

Why anyone would give these assholes an ounce of gold is beyond me. The poor will never see it. The SA just sells overpriced junk, which they get **for free**, to poor people.

Their clothes might be the only good thing going for them. 




 No, what this should put an end to is people who think they know everything, but as you've demonstrated, it has not.

Linux is just a tool. A great tool at that. It's stable, secure, and runs on billions of CPUs.

Proprietary operating systems suck because this caliber of hole goes unpatchable for a long time after being reported to the vendor.

The open source community is hammering out a fix right now. You can thank them for it. They are doing it for free, for you, since you don't know how.

Nothing personal. If you don't like it then call up your OEM and demand something more costly that may or may not work either, but probably has a piss poor track record by contrast.

Have a good one. 




 Texas is not the only place where corruption exists.

Look at the front page of this website. People everywhere are protesting against police brutality across the country.

If you hate Texas so much, then just leave. Your attitude sucks, and you are a coward for it. 




 Because it's Friday night, evidently. 




 Are you kidding? Have you ever sat in a Walmart parking lot with a 12 pack and a portable grill on Black Friday? In *Houston*? 

It's almost as good as watching UFC. The police scanner is just noise that adds to the frenzy. 




 not what retailers expected. 

I think you mean:

not what stockholders were told.

Overall I think people are buying more useless junk than ever - they just don't have to spend all their money on it one day anymore. 




 The best deal I ever got on Black Friday was at Home Depot. I bought some 5 cu. ft. storage containers to put all my other junk in. I think I paid about $2 each for like 10 of them.

That's 50 cubic feet of shit.

I even labeled what kind of junk it was before I stacked it on the curb, ie "Random Junk", "Miscellaneous Junk", "Broken Junk", "Her Junk", "Cheap Junk", "Incomplete Junk", "Useless Junk", etc.

Now I spend Black Friday in the parking lot at Walmart with a 12 pack and a portable grill, listening to a police scanner and wearing obnoxious jerseys, so I can watch everyone spend their hard earned money on the exact same junk I threw away years ago. 




 Put your mother-in-law through an orthodontic college. It might be more than a year, but you'll have free dental care for life for the whole family, which will save tens of thousands of dollars because we all know you need more dental work than you let on.

Bonus for getting her to pay for it.

Might as well. She's not doing anything else anyway.

*I don't recommend this if you have an uneasy relationship with your mother-in-law. 




 You won't have a lick of sense until you are 40.

-Landlord 




 Ill say its a reach, but you can bet your ass NK has some gear and the experts to run it. One does not need big iron or even to start young to pull off something like this. One needs only determination and patience.

Of course, being a genius would probably help some, and I dont doubt that there are more than a few highly capable within the ranks of that goverment. 




 Why bother asking Shell for money they wont pay? If I were Nigeria I would sell my oil on my own. What a concept. 




 Usually the glaciers from the mountains in west Texas dont reach Corpus until around mid-January, but this year an ice flow is expected down the Guadalupe river that might bring colder air temps into the area.

I dont know what to tell you. If you ever get Internet access where you are at you might check the forecast. Its snowing here right now with 45 mph winds and temperatures are expected to dip into the single digits this week. Id go ahead and reserve a condo in Port A just in case the Gulf of Mexico ice sheet doesnt advance until the glaciers get here. 




 As a proud citizen of a free country, I think I speak for many when I say:

**THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT CAN WALK BACKWARDS INTO A BAG OF DICKS** 




 Blame the victim, why don't you?



 




 I was just trying to help.

Much wasn't offered about the situation other than the fact that someone wanted a handout, so I had to work with what I was given.

Speaking of which, this time of year there is a lot of dead brush piling up. Does it hurt to ask people if they need something done with their yard or around the house? 




 Someone should introduce a bill to require actual competence to hold public office. 




 When I was your age I was making piles of brush 10 feet tall in my neighborhood for money. If you have access to a lawn mower I'm sure people will be glad to pay you to mow their yards.

Good luck!
