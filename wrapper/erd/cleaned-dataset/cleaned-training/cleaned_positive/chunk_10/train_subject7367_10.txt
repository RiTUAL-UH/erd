This sounds like a dangerous position. I think I know where you're coming from, if you want someone to talk to feel free to PM me. Just know you're never alone :) 
Edit: I've had problems with medication, but I think you should talk to a doctor or therapist. I have no place to judge, but the sleeping pills sound harmful to you. Speaking from experience, you should try developing more healthy habits and getting in touch with people you have a more solid relationship with.  




 The thing about being diagnosed is that it solidified my problem and made it into something that needed to be TREATED, rather than just feeling sad and thinking that doing something fun or taking some time for myself could help. In a way, (at least for me) it was easier to deal with when there was no concrete solution, somehow. I don't know if anyone else experienced this 




 Thanks for the reading material :) I'm glad I started treatment relatively early. I guess for a while I've thought of it as 'crazy' because of the stereotype the media puts on people with depression. Besides, at 16 it's hard not to feel crazy. Especially since being 'crazy' and having all sorts of issues somehow makes you cool and sexy... That annoys me to no end
