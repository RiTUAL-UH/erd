 Una foden?  




 it is for 10 minutes. but the feeling of thighs rubbing, completely losing what used to be a good waistline, and horrifically fat arms is not worth it, yet i still do it. i used to be 140lbs (am 5ft 7 ) and thought i was fat.  




 feels like no one / the world can't get you there.
