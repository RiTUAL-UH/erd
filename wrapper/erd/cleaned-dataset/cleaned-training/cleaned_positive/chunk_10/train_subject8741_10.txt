 I don't understand why they would say that must be a lot of self righteous ass holes where you are .......I'm white and Christian  And the way I see it. It's comforting to talk with that even has a faith these days lol.  I had a good friend that was Muslim but he unfortunately passed away suddenly a few years ago.....I miss him a lot. I cried so hard.  I've actually had a pretty good day. I went to the laundry mat and did.chores today and completed them lol. It was very hot today I live in north Carolina and it was over 100 today.
