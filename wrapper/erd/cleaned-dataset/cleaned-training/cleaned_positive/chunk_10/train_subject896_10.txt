 A 4 month manic? Wow. Mine hardly last three weeks let alone four months. I understand with the whole fatigue thing. Lately I either dont sleep at all or I sleep 17 hours (done that twice now since this episode started). 




 May I ask how I've helped? 




 Hello friends, gamers, fellow Spartans! A few summers ago I had just gotten my Roxio game cap and decided to play my favorite game(s) and use it to stream. Well. Its now a few summers later and I have a new computer that will support my streaming in a better quality and wont crash every 15 seconds. With that being said, I am planning on marathoning ALL the Halo games thus far (Xbox 360 versions no MCC, sorry) in marathon on Heroic next week. If you want to join me on this adventure, message me on here with what game you want to help on, or message me on XBL @ Troop4921 with what game you wish to help on. Obviously, each game (only exception Halo 2) will have 4 slots including myself, so space is limited. I will leave a roster below including the names of who will be joining me during the games, and a general idea of when they are. I will play them in chronological order of storyline, so that way those who don't know the lore will get an okay idea. The stream will be shown on my channel, [here](twitch.tv/train_subject896) and anyone else who plays is more than welcome to host it on their channel as well.

 Im not at all disappointed. Im not much of a screenwriter but Bethesda definitely hit the ball into the right park with this one. I still think my idea is better though ;D 




 I buy LE's of games like nobodies business. Even for games I don't particularly like. Black Ops 2 Care package being my biggest mistake. However, I dont buy them for the game, I buy it for all the cool content that I can mess with and physically see. So that being said, some of my ideas for a LE Fallout 4 would be similar to [this](https://m.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/306chv/fallout_anthology_mininukedropping_in_september/) with the game in a steelbook case that looks war torn and has a BoS/Protagonist symbol on one side and an Enclave/Antagonist on the other. Comes with DLC obviously, but maybe only things that will barely affect the gameplay. Also, maybe could include a little bobble head holding a bottle cap for all the "caps" you spent to get a hold on him.


Any thoughts??? 




 I'd be more than happy to play with you! Are you going to host the world? And if so, are you going to start a new world from scratch (I presume so because you said you lost the game files)?  




 Here is what I did:
Find your bulb and clear out a space about 20 long to each side and maybe 6 tall. At the end of each side, close off a small enough room to house a teleporter and campfire. On the wall that faces inwards towards the bulb, leave a space for you to shoot through with megashark. Pop the bulb and immediately run to one of the teleporters and shoot at her until she gets close. Then, with your preferred means of triggering, use the teleporter and shoot at her from the other side. 




 Hell yeah man I'd always be up for a collab! Couple quick questions for my sake though: What software do you use to record your gameplay? Could I post my own recordings on my channel as well as cycling the episodes? How would my audio get to your videos?

My youtube channel should be accessible through youtube.com/channel/troop4921
Go check me out man! 




 So after seeing all the images from the puzzle and it being completed, I got really excited seeing Locke with three other Spartans. Now, its never set in stone whether these are SII's or SIV's, cause lets be real here, they sure arent SIII's. So my thoughts on if they are the second gen, is that it may be Grey team. Looking at [this](http://i.imgur.com/3zmdc9q.jpg) image from left to right we get an unnamed male, unnamed female, Locke, and another unnamed male. So in my little headcanon, ONI redirected Grey Team, merciless hidden assassins they are, to the mission to kill a long time friend cause if anyone can kill a Spartan, its another spartan. It very well could be them to going left to right it could be Mike/Jai, Adrianna, Locke, and Mike/Jai. Any thougths? 




 The only reason Grey Team is really listed MIA is cause their under ONI's wing doing missions out in the BFE of space. So it's not that their necessarily MIA but rather lowkey away from the rest of the world.
 




 So from left to right is it Linda, John, Kelly, and Fred? I really doubt Fred honestly after reading Glasslands and (sadly only part of) Thursday War with the way he acts towards Mendez. But alas, I would love to see the full blue team in person especially with someone (Kelly presumably) wearing the Spartan III armor. 









 Hello my fellow Spartans! So I will be the first to admit that my new years resolution of losing weight definitely didn't last. However, I finally decided to change this when I realized that my cosplay wont look good if I'm as big as I am right now. So for anybody else out there who is still trying to get down on their weight or needs a nerdy motivator for it all, this is the post!

So far, I have found one solid workout [here](http://darebee.com/workouts/master-chief-workout.html) and I tried it. It killed my legs. BUT it felt good. So I'm asking all of you now, if you know of any or have created any workouts centered around Halo, post them here.

Also for extra credit points; if you know the exact workout the Spartan-II's went through when they were younger and could post that would be the coolest. I faintly remember reading about it somewhere. Fall of Reach or one of the books I know for sure. 









 So put yourself in my place, I just scored a 30 on my ACT and feel 2 kewl 4 scewl. So I've been slacking off. A lot. Especially in the class I'm currently in. Personal Finance. The only class I have felt like I need to learn. Yet, everyday I come in and the teacher isn't here so I log in to my computer, open up Chrome, and without thinking twice, open up this subreddit. Oops. I now have a 48% in this class with a standard 3.0 GPA. This may be bad.

tldr; I slack off in class by coming on here. 




 Deposited a level 38, female, Petilil, no IGN message, is La!:) 




 Calm down there Miley Cyrus. 




 Just like the title asks; is it possible to max a skill with just quests and natural progression as opposed to grinding and farming? Im sure its possible, though much slower, but are there any guides to do it? Furthermore, on a skill that is already 60, is it possible to max it in 12 hours or less? 




 Sadly, still only combat 68 lol. Man, Ive got some levels to catch up on. 




 Everyone is recommending World Wakes but... uh.. I cant. lol. Too low of a level. Most my attack skills are mid 50's and World Wakes needs like 70+ doesnt it? Even if it doesnt, theres a lot for me to do before anyways.
 




 I jumped on once in between and got a run down of that thing. After adding a few more hours onto my gameplay, I'm honestly kinda liking the abilities thing. However, I do miss my blood splatter to show damage lol.
 




 No joke. I joined Runescape back in early 2008 and was a dedicated player and member. And then they came out with the graphic overhaul and the village tasks and all this crap in 2010 and I lost interest and didnt touch my account until about three weeks ago. I started playing around and fell back in love but so much has changed and I dont like it. So can someone give me a quick summary (if at all possible) what's been added and taken out since 2010? Im a member again so P2P is also a deal for me. 




 May I x-post onto /r/ODST? 














 aw:L So we can't nominate things from other halo subreddits? 




 I think there should be a category for game nights or people that helped start those! 




 TIL that a 9 year old knows more about minecraft than I do. 




 Hey guys, whats up it is train_subject896(mod of /r/ODST) here and I am hoping to help anyone and everyone that needs an achievement, get it. I am 10 achievements away from 100%ing ODST and I would like to extend the welcome to anyone that wants to join! My gamertag is Troop4921 and I am only missing Vidmaster's Deja Vu and Classic, along with Firefight's Last Exit, Chasm Ten, Windward, Rally Point, Lost Platoon, and Crater. I am also missing Audiophile and Naughty, Naugthy. If you are also missing any of these, comment down below or shoot me a message on XBL!!! I will be on almost all weekend long trying to get some achievements of my own! Hope you all can join me on the battlefield.

 I won't be able to sadly!:( I have a tournament for school to attend:(( Really sorry mate. 




 Oh yeah. Hopefully they release a Halo themed XBOne in time for holidays. 




 Okay, looks like yours won. I will be doing a teaser for it soon! Keep out an open eye! 




 I feel like the Doctor is a bit overdone honestly. But if I did this, I would totally be 6!:) 




 uhh. can I put a not on [this](https://s-media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/ae/07/a3/ae07a3ddcdc253fabd57a100ba1a3ad7.jpg)
 




 Hey guys! I just recently rebranded my channel and have been really thinking about what I want to do next with it. So, since I decided on FONV, I came here to ask;

What should be the theme of my Let's Play?

Right now, a big inspiration for me is Many A True Nerd who is doing a You Only Live Once Let's Play which I would like to adapt off of. Please let me know what you think I should do!

If you want to see what I've done before, my youtube is now under the same name as my reddit username. 














 I can help tomorrow from about 3-5!:) GT:Troop4921 









 Hey guys! I know I have been **SUPER** inactive as of late but all will be made up with over time. However, I am proposing a few gameplay timings within the next couple of days so bear with me.
On Friday(10/17), from 2:30 CST to 4, I will be able to play online with anyone.
On Saturday(10/18), I can play most all day until around 4 PM.
On Sunday (10/19), I propose an all day entire community play together and achievement hunt!
So, list what times you can play and your gamertag and we can all play together! Sorry it took so long to get one going again but hey, I'm trying! 




 I was 7 when the first Xbox game I owned was that beautiful game of Halo 2.

I'm 17 now and don't have and Xbox One for the game otherwise I would camp out for this fucker. 




 Hi! I've been having this error pop up for a week straight now. I am trying to get 7 Days to Die, my card is still active and has enough money on it, and I have perfect connection, I've tried on both the desktop app and website and both return me this error. HELP!:( 




 [Speech 25/50 50%] Do you have a snapchat?;) 




 I totally meant 60s. My bad. I'm thinking like, Buddy Holly, Big Bopper, Ritchie Valens, people like that. Sorry.  




 Imagine it though. There you are, in your chair, watching the newest Fallout gamer video when you get the advertisement. All it is in the first five seconds is the Bethesda intro. Immediately piques your interest so you watch on. Next thing you see is out a windshield, not of a car but a plane, and your camera pans back behind the pilot who is frantically yelling "Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!" as you hear a 40's rock song slowly fade in. The camera fades to dark and shows one person, a ghoul now, walking away from the wreckage with a few small mushroom clouds in the background. It fades again and a black screen comes on with the Vault Boy and "Reserve your spot today!" with the release date under it.

**PLEASE BETHESDA PLEASE** 




 1: You can kill Yes Man (does he just find a new body or stay dead? Didn't play much longer after I killed him)
2:Having Cannibal as a perk is very entertaining in the Ultra Luxe
3: Recruiting the First Recon against Driver Nephi is useless if you're a sniper yourself. 




 Challenge accepted. 




 Yeah, I have GRA and Courier's Stash though so I start with stuff more powerful than all that. So I fixed it then sold it. 









 It just slowed me down a TON last time I got it and just ew. I wish I could do it without rainmeter but nah
 




 I WANT BUT I HATE HATE **HATE** RAINMETER 




 Yeah! So you know how there is the pond with the little cave next to it? There is one on the opposite side (I want to say North side?) of it. Or for better reference its [the top pool of water](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Quarry_Junction?file=QuarryJunctionlocalreal.jpg) 




 If you look really close, he looks like the silence from Doctor Who. 




 I may have set the bar fairly high for you /u/ManyATrueNerd 




 God, I could never do FO1/2. You'd see me get a five minute playthrough. I want to record my playthrough of this but I've got a few too many over powered mods on my side. Namely, the DMR I can steal at the beginning and [Perk At Every Level](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34707/?). I saw the thing that was front page last week about his FO3 Kill Everything playthrough so I started following and watched all of that and his Kill Everything FONV and gosh I love his channel. Hope mine gets as famous. 




 No lie, MATN is exactly where I got the inspiration for this playthrough. I actually changed a bit on mine though and allowed healing but the conditions are **1)** I can't heal in battle **2)**Has to be food/drink I have made myself **3)** Headcanon that my character has a fear of needles which prevents use of Med-X, Psycho, and Stims. Even with these, still difficult as all get out. I think I'm around lvl 8 now and coming up on Novac so it's going to be fun. 




 I actually came around to the Quarry from Yangtze Memorial to get the Fat man and mini-nuke. THEN went to the front and got one of the normal deathclaws out of the way and used Ratslayer to snipe off as many as I could until it was just the mother and Alpha and the rest is present. It was definitely a challenge. 









 Get a Cowboy Rifle before level 10 if at all possible. Don't worry about looking for unique things until postgame. Good Natured is always a good perk to choose cause you will only specialize in one or maybe two attack stats as opposed to the universal Medicine, Repair, Speech, and Barter. 




 I suggest following [this](http://youtu.be/N8XLN1N0vtM) playthrough and trying to match it 




 It looks like the guy in front has a pistol not from in game. 




 I recently started replaying FO3 and came up to Oasis. Just before this, however, I had been reading up on lore and came across the actual story of Harold *hint hint link [link](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Harold)* and it was heartwrenching for me listening to him talk and explain his story. He had been living like this for some time and before this he never once did anything about it. So when I went under, having both ointments and a chance to help Harold live on, and I shot him, I sat and roleplay(and really) cried in a corner for 10 minutes.
