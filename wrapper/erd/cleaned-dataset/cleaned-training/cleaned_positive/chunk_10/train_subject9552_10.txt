 SpaceX's announcement of their plan for Mars. 




 I have had experience with this for the past couple of years. I've gained a few thoughts from it. They usually might actually have something scheduled at the times you propose to hang out, but they are unwilling or too lazy to make time for you. They will probably not care enough unless several people are involved that they know and enjoy spending time with. You might want to start with that fact - plan a fun group hangout for something kind of big, like a beach trip or a movie premiere (some event or activity everyone would like to really do). Invite several people in the friend circle, and let them know that others will be coming along with you. In the hangout, though others will most likely be chatting with their own close pals, you will still have the opportunity to interact with them and strengthen some of their memories with and of you. Please let me know how this works. I truly empathize with you. 

Edit: In addition, if they say no to events and activities that take more time than a walk (as you mentioned in a comment earlier), they're probably worried that it might cut into their downtime that they feel they need. In this case, you should plan an event a week or a couple into the future so that they will be able to expect it and arrange their schedule physically or even subconsciously around it. And, it's pretty bullshit of them to say they'll be busy at the exact time you propose half a month into the future. Best of luck to you. 
 




 Thanks for such a detailed response. My own definition of success is not really becoming wealthy, but rather making significant contributions to future technology (designing or inventing apparatus that impact the world positively in some small way). I was wondering, do many engineers have the opportunity to invent or create something new when working for a company? Do these opportunities commonly blossom into full-fledged, successful products?  




 Today I was discussing what I was planning to major in with my mom (mechanical engineering), and when my dad walked in, he became incredibly upset.  As an electrical engineer in the Silicon Valley, he's worked for company after company that shut down. He sat me down and told me several things about why becoming an engineer is not a good idea whatsoever. All of it was very disheartening, and I was hoping that you, engineers, could either confirm, clarify, or offer significant examples disproving what he has told me. :


* The salary you receive as an engineer does not allow you to have a significant amount of savings. (He explained this through an example of a $90,000 starting salary and a $70,000 overall living expense - I was kind of skeptical about this one, as I'm just a high school student).

* Anyone can code or learn engineering. (He gave me examples of successful engineers that majored in something unrelated to engineering that did well in their companies; he also taught himself a majority of what he knows now).

* Working on a project in a company or creating new technology is difficult because people are not going to want to take on extra work and risk their job if it fails. 

* You will not go much farther above what you started as an entry level applicant unless you work towards management, which is difficult considering you are competing with over 50 qualified coworkers or candidates.

* You will not be recognized for your work or the extra hours you put in very easily. 

* Most people you will work with will be apathetic. 

* When you get a job at a company, you never know if that company is truly going to succeed or run out of business. It's simply luck if you are accepted  or pick a company to work for that actually succeeds.

* Technology moves so quickly that by the time you are 30 - 40 years old, your knowledge will be outdated and the risk of losing your job will be dangerously high. 

* In the end, there is no meaning to your job because you won't have the opportunity to truly be involved in decisions or significant, successful development.

* (To me:) "The very successful engineers are those who already accomplished a great deal by 15 years of age and went on to found successful companies. You have intelligence, but it's very unlikely you have anything profound. You've not done anything, otherwise I would have suggested engineering as your career." (That's funny, because he always discouraged me from learning to code or even joining my robotics team. He never gave me the chance. But it's a fair point - how do I even know I'd be good at engineering?)


I understand that some of the stuff I'm sharing with you might be offending to some engineers that take pride in their work. I was very upset to have heard all of this. I'm sorry. I just want to know whether what he has said is the hard truth or partly exaggerated or independent to his experience and his companies' environments. I want to become an aerospace engineer, a part of furthering technology to feasible space travel and colonization. I'm okay with never becoming wealthy. I'm okay with never being able to set foot on another planet or geophysical body other than Earth. I just want to help humanity get off this planet, even if I won't see it in my lifetime. I realize that this endeavor might be naive, but its the only thing that kept me alive during a rough, dark year, and what I work incredibly hard for now. I appreciate all of your responses. Thank you.   
 




 If you take two digits from 0 - 9 and add them, and then add it to the number 9, and then add the digits of the resulting number, you will get the sum of the original two digits. 
It's pretty fun to do it with a digital clock. 




 *Laugh track plays loudly* 




 Witnessing, and possibly being a part of, future technological advancements. 




 That's the one! I didn't think it was that amazing, but I enjoyed reading some of it. It had a bit of humor and the characters were very likable.  




 I've been meaning to read that! I've read The Fault In Our Stars, but it didn't particularly stand out to me - I think I really enjoyed Paper Towns more.
