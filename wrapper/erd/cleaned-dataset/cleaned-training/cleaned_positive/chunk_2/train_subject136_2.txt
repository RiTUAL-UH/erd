 How can you eat so much steak in an affordable manner? 




 Conan O'Brien spoiled The Sixth Sense for me.  I haven't been able to watch it since.   




 Can I access them in America?

EDIT:  I see I can.  Gracias por su ayuda!
EDIT 2:  The text is still different.  For example they'll say "perdon" but the text will say "disculpe".  But something is better than nothing I guess. 




 I wish I had the answer.  It's sad.  The ironic thing is that there are more blacks in college than any other period in history yet there's probably more teenage pregnancies as well.  So we're doing better, but worse at the same time.

I don't have the percentage breakdown tho.  Forgive me. 




 "Stop actin' like a lil bitch.  You'll be alright."   Strangely this worked better than the cookie cutter stuff. 




 It started with the government pushing drugs into the black communities.  It's documented and everything.

People like to blame black people like we don't come from a history of hard workers.  Insert drugs, destroy black male leadership by having J. Edgar Hoover  take down the Black Panther Party and here we are today. 




 Not sure I understand this.  For example in boxing a right handed person leads with his left foot forward and his left hand closer to his opponent.  Are you suggesting they box southpaw? 




 I used to work for Papa Johns.  Do the drivers still dilly dally and avoid hard work while waiting for orders to come out?  

In the two stores I worked at the drivers would play hooky while I stood up all day making pizzas, answering calls, and folding boxes.

Also, do you know how to toss dough? 




 Someone needs to make a "negged" version of that gif. 




 Yeah it's the latter.  I already know about VLC sync.  I love it.

Like someone said earlier, close captioning is probably what I'm lookin for 




 Vivo en Iowa.  Hay un poco de nieve en las calles.  La temperatura es de cinco grados.  Soy originalmente de Georgia.  Por eso, no me gusta la temperatura y soy muy frio. 




 True.  Is there a high availability of Spanish shows/movies with closed captioning?  I know on Telemundo they have closed captions but I can't find any dvds with it.  I also can't access the captions on through my HD tv and cable box.  (but I know they work because I've seen them on other tvs) 




 Last time I watched a Spanish movie on Netflix it only had English and France as subtitle options.  I'll check again. 




 I've gotten some from there but they don't match up.  I don't know if its because I'm watching the Latin American version and the subs are from Spain or what, but its frustrating. 




 Puedo buscar peliculas en ingles con subtitulos en espanol pero no puedo encontrar peliculas en espanol con subtitulos en espanol.  Sin embargo hay muchas peliculas en espanol con subtitulos en otras lenguas.

Can anybody help?  I'm willing to pay.  This goes for official dvd releases as well.

Oh yeah I used both *buscar* and *encontrar* in the passage above because I'm not sure which one I should've used.  

I also have a hard time finding subtitles for English movies dubbed in Spanish.  The ones I find are slightly off.  The actors are using a script so I'm sure the proper version exists somewhere. 




 did you give her a real chance? - no rebound, pity acceptance of relationship, sex only relationship, other. crap reasons to be with someone

It was a semi-rebound I guess. but I gave her a chance

were you attracted to her? physically, intelectually, emotionally

Of course.  

what are the best things about her?

She's independent, smart, attractive, genuinely fun to be with at times.

what are the worst things about her?

She is the total opposite of me and is HIGHLY emotional.  She can be rude and cut people off when talking.  Also in most cases she lacks the ability to look at herself from other's perspective.  and she can be a tad bit materialistic.

what's her favourite thing? something that always makes her smile

Makeup accessories, Hello Kitty, coffee, tea... I could go on and on.

what was the greatest thing you've ever done for her happyness alone?

I cant single out one thing by itself.  I spoiled her at Christmas though.

have you thought about her while out with friends/work wtv?

Sure.

have you always been there for her when she was sad? have you done stuff to make her happy after?

Usually.  The only problem is since she's so emotional, she gets sad and mad a lot.  This is admittedly my weak spot because I never know what to do in these situations so I just listen and try to be empathetic.  Best thing I can do is take her mind off of it.

ever thought about marrying her? giving her babies?

Not until right before the end.  I would have kids with her.  She only wants one but I think that she was open to changing that. 




 Yeah she knows.  I told her when I was breaking up that I didn't think it was fair for her to be with someone who didn't care as much as she did.  




 Actually I was in a relationship from ages 20-27 and was really in love with that girl.  So I know what it feels like.  But sometimes I feel like I'm unfairly comparing my new girl to my old one.

But I also got my heart broken in that relationship so I'm apprehensive to let my guard down and love again. 




 He's not saying it because he doesn't love you.  He might care about you A LOT, but saying it is a probably a pretty big deal to him.  He would probably feel all sorts of anxiety and pressure once he says it.

I put my last girlfriend through something similar before I cut it off since I wasn't in love as much as she was.  No one should ever have to be in a lopsided relationship.

Keep in mind my actions all pointed to me loving her.  I did everything you could ask a bf to do, but my heart wasn't all the way in it.  

If it's an issue to you it's probably worth bringing it up with him. 




 She was in love and I wasn't ready for all that.  We were together 7 months.  I feel like I did her a favor by not wasting her time any more.  But now I feel lonely and sad.  

I'd reach out to her but I feel it's a selfish move if I'm not ready to give it my all.  I really wish we could be friends and I hope she's around when I get it all together but she has a strict "no contact" policy with exes.

Any advice?  



**TL;DR.**  Dumped gf, right decision, help me feel better about it. 

**EDIT:  I think I may actually love her.  But I'm not sure.  How can you be sure?  I feel like the fact that I'm not sure means I should leave it alone.** 




 Your husband is a fucking scumbag.

 Its not everywhere though.  Wal-Mart has it but Target doesn't.

It's just a start.  I got bored one day at work and ran with it.  I'm sure someone else could do a MUCH better job.

My logic was to create a basic avatar comprised of cells that I could fill in with the colors of clothes I actually own.  This allows me to get an idea how colors work together when layering.

The downside is that its very hard to get patterns (plaid, etc.) in Excel.  Also, I had to make my best guess as to find the closest color to khaki and the jeans I own. 




 I took pictures of my closet then tried my best to match the colors in Excel at work. 




 I feel your pain.  I'm in a relatively small city and I feel like I have very few occassions to show off my nice clothes.
 




 This is funny.  I've been doing all my layering and outfitting in excel.  I created a person that looks like an 8-bit video game character and match up my outfits by filling the cells. 




 What are your politcal view?  just curious 




 Judging people solely off of their appearance.  I'm guilty of this but I don't like when others do it. 




 So what's the plan when you get married?  Are you expecting the problem to magically go away?  You might as well deal with it now and make the tough suggestion. 




 You should be.  I do the same thing, but she's only my girlfriend.  I would expect myself to be completely open with my spouse.  Some people are very private, but you're his wife and you guys should have an open-access policy. 




 Dude this sounds like me to a tee!  *mind blown* 




 I think you're overexaggerating a bit.  People don't usually get excited when a 6'10" center does a simple two hand dunk under the basket.

But when you see Gerald Green come through the paint and windmill dunk on somebody of equal or taller height then its a big deal.  Because that's pretty rare and hard to do. 




 I went to the store today and didn't see any.  Maybe others will have better luck. 




 Holy crap how did I miss this.  Thanks.  I've also started looking at albums for inspiration. 




 Thanks.  I will keep this in mind. 




 I'm confused.  Are you telling me to splash the alcohol on my face or rub it?  Or both?  Also, won't alcohol dry my skin out? 




 Thanks.  I read thru it and it seems like a very arduous process that he still has trouble with.

The thing about hair like ours is if you make ONE mistake its a wrap and your neck looks like a Nestle Crunch bar.

I've bookmarked that thread while I continue to do research.

 The Spirit.  worst movie ever.   




 Nice try Geico exec 




 What does your app provide that google maps can't?  I think either way it should be free.  I rarely pay for apps unless they're EXTREMELY useful with a slick UI. 




 No offense to the non-black guys.  It's just that ***I've heard it all before.***

I currently use a pair of Andis T-Outliners to cut my facial hair.  I still get razor bumps but its kept to a minimum.

Every now and then I get the urge to shave with a razor and it **always ends up badly**.  I even splurged on an Art of Shaving kit one time using the brush with the lather and oil before shaving, etc.  I followed the instructions on the dvd and  STILL got crazy razor bumps.

My facial hair is very coarse, thick, and curly.  Even more so than the typical African American's.  To put it in perspective **I can use a depilatory like extra strength Magic Shave, leave it on my face for 30 minutes (double the time listed on the container), and it will still leave a good 30% of my hairs on my face.**  My facial hairs are some tough sons of bitches.

So any input is welcome.  I'd grow out my beard if it didn't look so sparse and patchy.  Also, my beard grain goes in all types of directions so shaving with cream and not being able to see the hair is a risk I'm concerned about.

A search brought me here and I'm really hoping this can solve one of my major dilemmas in life. 




 There's no way to learn a language "fast."  The fastest method would be to move to Japan and put yourself in a "learn or die" situation. 




 SHIA THE BUFF! 




 I agree.  A lot of this stuff is just positive quotes and lip service.  That doesn't move me. 




 Just drop him off somewhere in the deep south.  Preferably Mississippi or Alabama. He'd never know the difference. 




 This is awesome.  I liked this part the best

But Robbins is self-taught, and his devotion to his studies borders on the monastic. **Every moment not spent refining his technique or in some way expanding his knowledge of human nature and how to exploit it is, to his mind, time wasted.** 
 




 You're in Atlanta?  I'd go to GT or Emory if I were you.  Full time to get the complete experience as well. 




 Tell me how I can work from home.  How much do you make?
