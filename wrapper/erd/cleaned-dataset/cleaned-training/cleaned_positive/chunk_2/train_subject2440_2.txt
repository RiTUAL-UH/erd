 Thanks. Attorney took 25% of the amount accumulated since you first filed and were denied or that *and* 25% of SSDI into the future, too? I ask because, is there a minimum money involved for them to be interested?

Edit: also was the SSI appointed lawyer the one who won your grant, or some other? 




 Also, watch /r/IAmA. I am about to post (in 8 minutes) an IAmA request for anyone who has tips on getting approved for Social Security Disability Insurance due to depression (request for recipients, social workers and attorneys).
