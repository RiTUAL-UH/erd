 Scared the shit out of me.. Not the bike.  The track, being on one. So nervous i didnt enjoy it. Any advice? 
 









 The 250 i had before was great height. For reference im 5'3.  The 600 is a bit tall for me.  




 Helps when you link me to it ;)  




 I'm the girlfriend and mine is the green one c: 




 We're sexy  




 I didn't enjoy skyward sword at all. In fact I didn't like it so much I never bothered to finish it.  The controls for swimming I thing irritated me the most about it. And all the other bs that came with it. One of my favourites is MM. I can say I've beaten it more then any other one.  But anyway the point is I think I actually hated skyward sword. Wii controls in general I find too flailey and I find myself disliking the entire motion control system. Just my two cents.   




 Horses should be moved down :P 




 woo this is going to be me once i finally get my zx-6r certified c: can't wait for spring. Just upgraded this year from the 250r
