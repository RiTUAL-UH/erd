 Great little post and yes, we are not our anxiety! :)

I suffer with anxiety...and have suffered with depression, bulimia, self-harm. My greatest achievement to date is setting up my new blog called [The Unmarked Road](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com) which aims to support people currently struggling with similar issues and helping people see that there is hope and a chance to live a normal life.

 Hi Jkwazz. I'm sorry to hear you are struggling. When I came off anti-depressants, I had the worst withdrawal, even though the doctors said you can't get withdrawal from these particular drugs. I am not from the US so I can't help in that respect, but I thought I would message you anyway incase you needed someone to talk to. I have a blog called The Unmarked Road in which I talk about y experiences with depression, anxiety and a whole heap of other stuff. You can contact me privately through it at www.theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com if you need some support.
