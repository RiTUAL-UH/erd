 Im just saying its not okay for guys to force themselves onto girls and if thats what happened it should be reported and he should be punished for doing it not oh she was drunk so it was okay.. its not okay ever.. And if thats what happened it would put the OPs mind to rest about his trust for her knowing what happened. OP I hope you can sort it out but its a horrible position to be in :(  




 So its okay for her to be pressured into sleeping with the guy? I'm not saying that's what happened, I'm just trying to work out if she was taken advantage of, or if she cheated at her own will.. He doesn't have to beat the guy he can just threaten to report it to the cops and see what the girls thinks about that maybe she was forced and was too scared to say anything the whole thing seems odd to me. 




 Good I hope it all works out for you which ever way the story unfolds its just for the time being and things will get better in the future. Good luck!  




 I would beat the shit out of the girls brother then tell her your gonna take him to the cops for sexual assault and see if she sticks to her side of the story? Otherwise if she backs out she made the decision to cheat on you and this will never leave your mind..
