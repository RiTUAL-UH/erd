 I might get in a lot of trouble for saying this but the Lord of the Rings trilogy. 

I loved the films and the whole new generation of Tolkien fans it inspired, and I love the books for sure, but for me the films are just much more enjoyable.
The Hobbit, however, is a whole other barrel of dwarves; the films are watchable enough but I don't see them surpassing my affections for the book anytime soon :3

EDIT: Misspelled 'Tolkien'...awkward... 




 Seconded with Fight club, in fact I just said that somewhere else on this board.

EDIT: Just realised it's you again, mega awks :p 




 As a psychology person, it'd be remiss of me not to say anything by Oliver Sacks.

Even for those going in to psychology without plans for going into clinical or abnormal psychology, or I guess for anyone really, his books and his writings are just brimming with humanity and such respect for people and how we all variously experience the world. Definitely a strong role model for me throughout my time at university, and definitely influential on how I view a number of different aspects of the human experience.

Just such a lovely, intelligent, and witty man, everything he writes, and every documentary he features in, is a pleasure to read/watch :3

EDIT: a word
EXTRA EDIT: Hey I just realised you mentioned Oliver Sacks in your post anyway, OP. Rock on. 




 Yeah, and after loving the film for so long, dare I say I was actually a bit disappointed when I got around to the book :-\ 




 Seconded. I made it through, I appreciated bits of it. What more does the universe want from me 




 Me too, I wish I reread more books, and there are a couple that I do go back to over the years (The Hobbit, Jane Eyre, a book I read as a teen that meant a lot to me) but for the most part I just see that as time I could be spending on new titles. 

As with everything, I feel guilty about it :p 




 Threw up in my mouth a bit and wished I hadn't clicked, 10/10 




 That's adorable. I chuckled heartily 




 I've always felt pretty guilty about the amount that I not only sleep talk but sleep shout, actually, I pretty much only sleep shout... If I'm shouting angrily at someone in my dream then chances are I will shout it out loud too, waking us both up. It's become so routine (happens at least once or twice a month, usually more often during periods of stress or whatever) that we just accept it by now. I'll mumble a quick "sorry" and we'll both be back asleep again in seconds.


I've also hit him in my sleep a few times, usually pretty hard, I always feel really bad about it, especially seeing as I'm normally half awake as I do it, and realise just as I thump him that whatever I was fighting in my dream is actually just my sleeping SO. The first time I did it was only a week or so into our relationship, felt so so guilty about. I'd done the shouting thing before with a previous partner, but the hitting is a recent thing (I must sound like such a terrible person now, omg, he's pretty chill about it thankfully and teases me about it).


I'm honestly not an angry person or anything, IRL I'm really normally passive and quiet and would never hit anybody and rarely shout, nor do I tend to have particularly violent dreams. But if I do have them, chances are my boyfriend is gonna get hit or sworn at.

(Damn, he's tolerant, I'm going to go hug him right now...)

EDIT: Mostly it's just me yelling at dream antagonists to "F*CK OFF!" or some variation on that. Such rage, where does it all come from? Oh parasomnias, amirite?... 




 Ok, from what I can glean from Googling "Dune graphic novel" there was apparently a graphic novel made following the Lynch film...so, not so much of the book itself I'm afraid. But I must admit I'm curious to see it. io9 has a post from 2010 that's supposed to link to where it's hosted online but it doesn't seem to be there any longer... :(

Anyone here know anything about this? I'm so curious... 




 Guys...there should totally be a Dune graphic novel...

EDIT: Wait, there apparently already is one?! In which direction should I throw my money so I can own a copy? 




 This struck a chord with me... 




 "He IS the Kwisatz Haderach!" 




 Hey, I like the sound of that, maybe it's just because I'm so attractive I'm intimidating? Yeah, that'll be why ... *sobs heavily* 




 *something something* "just like your Mum" *something something* 




 I audibly "awwwww"-d :3 Are the two of them now friends? :p

This is precisely how my terrier would react; one time she picked up a mouse in a field that jumped out in front of her, froze in shock, and dropped it immediately. She used to be terrified of my gerbils :p 









 Are you a wizard? 




 She's basically a female Eric Cartman 




 I was expecting her to make him carry her perishable goods. This...this was much worse... 




 These are so gorgeous, thanks for sharing 




 It has some pretty blue eyes so there's that I guess...? 




 I will! :D I'm just finishing up another project this weekend but I feel that it's definitely time I turned my attentions to something inspirational and Dune related. Maybe I'll start a thread asking for quote suggestions? : 




 I know right? Who thought a colouring book for kids was a good idea?! http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2012/02/post_2.php 




 Don't worry it's completely SFW 




 Dude, harsh 




 Subs like /r/BeautyDiagrams and /r/Makeup are great but they seem often assume a level of pre-existing knowledge and familiarity with makeup, fashion, and beauty that not everyone (certainly not me at any rate) has.

Does anyone know of anywhere a totally clueless individual could find tutorials and advice, pitched at a sort of Explain Like I'm Five level? Basically for those of us who grew up without feminine mothers or sisters to explain all this stuff to us, and have since been muddling a long like idiots :p

 




 They don't like women, they don't like people in other subreddits, or anyone who isn't into Red Pill ideology. A lot of the time they talk like they hate other men...I don't think those guys like anybody... :-\ 




 You are not alone 




 I have sex dreams from time to time, like a regular person I guess, and they don't particularly bother me, unless they're particularly hilariously awkward like with someone I know. I always just think, "yeah whatever, it happens".


But then I have these dreams which aren't exactly sexual so much as...**completely adorable**, like I'm snuggling or just kissing with someone I know, and it's so tender and loving and PC and sweet, regardless of how I actually feel about that person IRL. And those are the ones I wake up from feeling a little bit guilty and awkward about, not the scary crazy sex-having dreams... :X 




 Hahaha...aw man... I wasted my one turn on a goddamn Hello Kitty bag... :( 




 Oh oh! And while we're on the subject, spot popping or squeezing videos, am I right? /r/popping Hell yeah. 




 I moved into a new flat in August last year and oh GOD the lighting in our bathroom is so bright and the wall space is basically three quarters mirror  at face height and I will spend minutes upon minutes.

Basically I'll tell my boyfriend I'm off to brush my teeth for bed but I get distracted and then half an hour later he'll have to come get me from there, my face all beat up and swollen and he'll be all "not this again god damn" and I'll have made tiny invisible or imagined imperfections into ugly marks that are gross but every time it is WORTH IT.

Edit: a word 




 Aw man, the compliments! The compliments make me feel like a princess :3

"Time for your facial spa treatment, my your skin is so radiant!"
 




 Yes yes yes, I got into it because I have a friend who's really into it and she suggested I watch a couple, so we talk about it sometimes, though I watch only occasionally myself these days. But yeah, it's the sort of thing that'd be really awkward to explain if someone walked in on you watching it... 




 Good choice. Also Heather Feather, if you find that you like the RP type videos, she's such a sweetie :3 they pretty much all are, actually 




 Yes, thank you, I love this site, such a good read 




 Oh man, this is just making me really sad, if anything :( especially when she mentions that she lives with her parents, they must be really worried for her.

Also, ew, my vagina just about clamped shut reading this. 




 Please deliver! Like, maybe this isn't the most popular comment ever but each one of us is a person who really frigging wants to see this picture! 




 This happened once to me! I was such a superstitious kid, unlike now, being a super suck-the-fun-out-of-everything-mega-skeptic, and I had lost a bag of mine, a Hello Kitty bag, for those who care. It was gone for days and it was bugging me so so much and I had turned the house top to bottom looking for it. I must have been about 10 or 11 and I thought "meh, maybe if I just focus on it really hard I'll be able to do some kind of remote viewing psychic voodoo or whatever".

Sat down and thought about the bag as vividly as I could and then the cupboard in our hall came to mind, equally vividly, the very first location that did come mind, too. Sure enough it was there, someone else must have tidied it away as I certainly hadn't put it there and it was completely an unlikely place for it, this was where we'd normally put things like phone books and stolen IKEA pencils, you know, hallway junk, but not bags.

Needless to say it never happened again or anything similar, as cool as I thought it was at the time and as hard as I tried to repeat it. The brain's a big place that remembers stuff you may have explicitly forgotten and we have plenty of unremarkable experiences in our lives, so...yeah, probs just a neat fluke/coincidence. But it totally rocked my 10/11 y/o mind. 




 This is a lovely idea, maybe I'll try live my life more like that's actually the case, thank you :)

(Side note, I think I've heard a similar thing before, like, what if everyone else is just you, but living out a different incarnation, I don't know if that makes me feel comforted or lonely) 




 Aw man, sorry to take things off topic but one time in high school we marathoned the extended edition LOTRs. Started about 10pm and finished the next morning. No one was allowed to sleep, one of the nicest memories I have from that time :3 Such a great time...

But yeah, enjoy the mini series. I keep meaning to check it out myself when I find the time, report back with findings! 




 Adorable :D great job 




 So tempted to make an inspirational cross stitch sampler of this... 




 Thanks everyone for your comments, it definitely seems possible to convert someone :p might just show him this thread and see what he thinks :3 




 Yay, that's reassuring. I wouldn't see why they'd be any more bitey than any other type of rodent. My aunt, who is a vet has always said it's hamsters she dreads dealing with the most in that regard :p  




 British person here, I don't think anyone referred to Queen Elizabeth's Mum as "the Queen's Mum". But her 'title' was "Queen Mother", so maybe that's what threw you off...?

 




 Hang tight and I'll try find some Youtube or other sorts of tutorials for you to try! (scurries off to have a look)

Edit:

Ok so here's a few things I've found...

**Bracelets**
Friendship bracelets are very inexpensive (for materials you just need the string/floss) and quite sweet, plus there's a lot of scope to make a custom, personal pattern or two, plus there's instructions for making them everywhere online:

Hope those are a helpful place to start, OP, sorry I didn't find loads of stuff, but I hope you find something to suit your crafting skill level and the sorts of things your girlfriend likes.
(Also, don't forget to let us know what you end up making!) 




 Also 800g?! I was aware males could get big but, wow! :O 




 Sweet, that's a whole bunch of cool information, I hope I can one day be in a situation to use all those rat care tips :3 




 Aww, yeah my Mum has said that if I get rats I can't take them home to visit her :p But then she always said we'd never get dogs...and now we have three, so... 




 Hi there :)


I would love to keep rats; goodness knows I've spent hours pouring over pictures and videos of them online, or researching the cages, food, supplies etc. I would buy for them. They seem like such smart, funny, lovable pets and I want so badly to adopt a whole bunch of them. I love keeping various animals and have had a variety of healthy happy pets over the years but have yet to have a go at keeping rats.


My only real problem, however, is that I live with a boyfriend (for now and the foreseeable future) who is very much staunchly against the idea of keeping rats. Together we currently have just the one pet, a Syrian hamster, and we both love her to bits. We're always talking about all the animals we'll own one day, he's just as pro-let's-get-a-whole-bunch-of-animals-to-live-with, as I am, but whenever the subject of rats comes up, he adamantly refuses to entertain the idea of getting any.

Hamsters/Mice/Gerbils/Degus/Chinchillas/Guinea pigs/Rabbits etc. are all fine: rats seem to be the only rodent he has a problem with. Reasons he's given so far include: "I don't like their tails" (yet mice tails, which are pretty much the same are fine?), "They're vicious and more 'bitey' than other rodents", and "They're too big" (yep, way bigger than a degu or a rabbit, sure...).


Obviously I'm not going to force the issue, and if he truly doesn't want rats in his home then I won't force them upon him, but his reasons against seem so trivial and I would so love to keep rats...


**TL-DR**
Does anyone here have any experiences of convincing the reluctant ones in their lives that rats are adorable? Were you yourself once anti-rat and if so what made you change your mind? Any input welcome, really, he seems currently immune to all the cute rat pictures I can throw at him. Appalling. :p 




 Out of interest who is the narrator for the audiobooks? 




 Yeah using lip balm makes you need lip balm (I'm definitely reliant on it)...but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a huge sinister money-spinning conspiracy, it's just a pretty much accepted annoyance
 




 I'm entirely new to this but so far as I can tell I think it's mostly done free hand, though molds and stencils can help you get certain shapes. I can see why a beginners' kit would come with a mold to make things a bit easier getting the general shape (I still found I had to 'sculpt' in quite a bit of definition freehand). 




 Aw shucks, thanks :) 




 How did you know?! :p Jabbed one of my fingers quite hard early on, after that I was a bit more careful, and 'only' had a few more lighter accidental hand stabbings... 




 Thanks, I mean, with a kit I couldn't go far wrong, to be honest :p

Although the instructions could have been a bit more helpful; I had no idea what sort of density I was meant to be aiming for, I stabbed away for hours and hoped for the best, really :) 




 Thank you, and yes I am feeling better :) I have a whole lot of work to do at the moment but you better believe I'm instead choosing to spend my time searching for needle felting supplies instead! 




 Thank you :3 I'm quite pleased with how he's turned out, too.
Totally going to try make needle felted versions of my pets now...

Edit: missing word 




 So very very many :p I'll must admit it did feel a bit wrong stabbing a tiny fluffy bunny... 




 Thank you :D 




 I wasn't feeling too well yesterday so I decided to treat myself to some craft supplies including a little needle felting kit by Dimensions. It was pretty fun considering I'd never even considered trying needle felting before :3

I totally want to do more!

(Also here's a few more pictures if you're interested http://imgur.com/a/u8Osj#0 )
