 I have great friends, an amazing boyfriend, all that jazz. It doesn't matter, I still feel lonely. They all care about me and love me, yet, I still feel so isolated from everyone. I hate this. I absolutely hate it. I'm a teenager, I'm supposed to be having the time of my life, not trapped inside my room wondering if they mean it when they say "I love you." 




 I cut. Today in PE a very bad cut started bleeding again. I got it to stop bleeding, but not without a few girls seeing. Someone went to the office and told them about my situation. When I was called into the counselor's office, I wasn't scared. I'm there quite often because I happen t hang out with all the self harming and suicidal kids at my school, along with my boyfriend. Until they told me what someone had said. I denied it all, but it didn't stop them from calling my mom... And CPS. When I got in the car, she wasn't mad, but she said I need to "work on myself" so now I am only allowed to have my phone one hour a night on weekdays,  four hours on weekends for a month. Usually, this wouldn't be big deal, but lately I have been going through a whole ton of shit that I don't want to talk about with anyone but two certain people, and now I really cant.

How do I deal with this? 




 I know, I know. It just was a spur of the moment.  




 I'm a freshman 









 I have done that so many times. Eventually, I stopped being cautious. When out with friends, I'm known as the "dare devil" because if I see a car coming, I don't move. If there is a bridge, I walk on the railing, hoping I fall off.
