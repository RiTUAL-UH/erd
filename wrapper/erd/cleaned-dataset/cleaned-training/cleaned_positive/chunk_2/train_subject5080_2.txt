 I search "appetite" in /r/keto and all I get is everyone barely able to meet their calorie goals because their appetite is gone.

I have PCOS, which my doctor tells me really sucks for appetite as it's usually more active in ladies with PCOS than those without.  My doctor also fully supports my journey with keto.

Mine's as ravenous as ever.  And keto foods are so calorie dense.  I've tried all the tricks: green tea, water, loads of greens, coconut oil, etc...  I don't have cravings, though, I just am always hungry. I'm also tired all the time.  

Right now I'm trying eat around 1400 calories/day, but frequently go up to 1800 or 2000.  Maybe 2 hours of working out every week, a mix of strength and walking on an incline. My usual day of meals is as follows:

*Breakfast*: almonds and string cheese (about 400 calories worth)

*Lunch*: Greek salad with EVOO and red wine vinegar + gyro meat or chicken

*Dinner*: 80/20 beef with vegetables (either as a taco salad or with cauliflower).

*Snacks*: Handful of almonds, spoonful of almond butter,  pan fried queso blanco, a few strawberries


I usually hit my macros pretty close (even accounting for the increased calories).  I'm not losing weight.  Lost the initial water weight, but nothing else, which I am attributing to my going above the calories I should have. 

Note: PCOS is linked to lowered BMR.  My doctor told me BMR calculators probably won't be accurate for me and that I should have an RMR test done.  This will happen as soon as I save up the money for one. 




 Introduction: Been on keto this time around for about 3 weeks.  Lost 7 pounds in the first week, stalled between 221.8 and 220 for the last 2 weeks.  Minimal exercise (maybe 1-2 hours/week), trying to stay under 1600 calories/day but usually going up to 1900-2000. Do IF 4 days/week, with 16 off/8 on. Measurements have been a consistent 38-35-46 since week 2.  Have PCOS with IR and am on 1000mg Metformin/day (recently reduced from 2000mg by Doctor's suggestion).  Doctor suggested keto for weight loss, plus I find it easy not to eat carbs. Tracking food religiously on MFP.  

**Keto foods are so fucking calorie dense** and I hate 85% of vegetables!  I will eat cauliflower and cabbage until I'm stuffed, but that's honestly up until the carb counts of the vegetables start to get high (2.5 cups of cauliflower is about 7g net carbs according to MFP).

I'm not going to give up, because I want to be healthy (not just skinny) and get pregnant.  But I just wanted to rant about how I never feel full unless I go over my calories!  

Currently cutting back on diet soda, hoping that will help. 









 Found Jamie Eason's 12 week program.  I'm obese, been going to the gym and trying to count calories for 3 weeks with very little results.  I think I need more structure, as in a defined meal plan rather than being left to my own devices.

I'm pretty good with strength training.  Do you think an obese person can do this program with only 3 weeks of strength training experience?  I need something to kick my ass and tell me exactly what to eat. 




 Doing layman research of my own, I can't find anything online that explains **why** it's so difficult.  I just find articles about BMR in women suffering from PCOS, weight loss studies, etc... affirming that it *is* more difficult for PCOS women to lose weight. 




 Stats: 25/f/223lbs.  Exercise: 25 minutes cardio (interval running) + machine weights MWF.  Goal: get fitter and slowly (but eventually) get to 160lbs.

My diet isn't 100% clean, but it's definitely mostly clean.  I'm also the pickiest eater imaginable, and I don't think a diet has to be full of foods I detest.  I hate eggs, but I eat them in the morning with salsa because it masks the taste.  I hate beans, and I hate most nuts (but not nut butters).  I'm having a hard time topping 100g of protein per day.  I know I should eventually have around 120g, but I'm just working on 100g right now.  

I love fruit.  If I have 2 pieces of whole wheat bread/day and a few pieces of fruit I don't have cravings for anything worse.  I measure everything religiously.  I just refuse to go over 1600 calories/day.  I'm not lifting heavy since I'm just starting out.  I'm getting the "going to the gym" routine set first because if I shove myself in the deep end I'll get discouraged and give up (as I have so many times before).

**Am I going to just need to eat less fruit and more meat?**

Typical day of eating:

Breakfast:
 
* 2 eggs with a little cheese, 2 slices of bacon, salsa, and lots of vegetables (2 egg muffin cups), 2 clementine oranges

Lunch:

* turkey sandwich (whole wheat bread) with homemade oven roasted turkey (4 oz), kale chips, 8 medium strawberries

Dinner:

* Either burger patty from 1/2lb raw 80/20 beef, 1.5 salmon burger patty (from seafood counter), 4 oz chicken, with some non-starchy vegetable

Snacks:

* 2-3 of the following per day: apple with (pure) almond butter, grapes, a little turkey, 2 clementines, kale chips


TL;DR: Not eating enough protein.  Without nuts and beans, how can I get more clean protein in?  Just eat less fruit and more meat?

 




 I've tried C25K in the past, I've tried every recommended method of trying to run.  I've run really slow, moderate pace, outside, inside, treadmill, track you name it.  My heart rate always got up to 187bpm within a minute of running.

I haven't run in probably 18 months.  In those 18 months I have started and quelled a battle with anxiety.  I've been on Celexa for 8 months now, and have not tried to run in those 8 months... until yesterday.

A little background: husband and I started eating healthy, tracking food, and working out one week ago today.  We both have confidence we are going to make it this time, and are taking it slowly, one day at a time.

Yesterday was my leg day.  I did my regular leg routine and just planned on walking with my husband on the treadmills for 30 minutes.  I got bored after about 2 minutes of walking and decided to try a light jog, hesitant that my HR would shoot up and I wouldn't be able to breathe very well.

Quite the contrary! My HR was at a max of 167, and I did intervals of running (90 seconds on, 2 minutes off).

I wanted to cry.  I'm now convinced I am able to run and will eventually be able to run a mile for the first time in my life.   When that day comes I will be bawling in the middle of my gym.

I feel like we're really going to make it this time. 




 This is for my husband. He's a pretty big guy, and we have been eating healthy, tracking cops, and going to the gym every day this week. Since starting, he has put on 10 lbs. I wouldn't believe it myself if I didn't see it.

The second day we worked out he hurt his elbow (tennis elbow) and I know muscle healing can cause water retention. But really? Ten pounds worth? 

I'm taking him to a doctor asap to get bloodwork done and make sure this regimen is ok for him, but due to work schedules this could take up to 6 weeks. 

Any advice? He's just a little discouraged. 

Typical workout week:
Monday: walking 30 mins + arms
Tuesday: walking + legs
Wednesday: walking
Thursday: walking + legs
Friday: walking + arms

Abs are done every day except Wednesday. 









 I started Starting Strength today.  I tried out some squats before attempting to use the bar just to check my form and I realized I can't squat to parallel.  I will either come up on my toes or fall backwards.  

I don't want to nix squats completely until my strength improves for me to be able to get to parallel.  I've read some places that doing kettlebell squats can help.  I just did no-weight squats facing the wall to make sure my form is correct.

Has anyone else been in this situation before?  Any suggestions on how to proceed from here?  I plan on continuing the SS workout, just supplementing barbell squats with kettlebell or something similar until the form is right. 




 I'm a dieting guru.  I've tried it all, failed at it all, and now I'm extremely discouraged. 

I just finished day 5 of whole30, where basically for 30 days you don't put anything artificial in your body.  It's paleo, but doesn't allow for paleo hacks either (like paleo desserts), and no artificial sweeteners, limited fruit intake, no dairy or legumes, etc....  I'm so pissed off today.  I hate greens, I hate vegetables, I don't think this is ever going to work for me.

I've had food issues since I was young.  When I was 3 my parents found me eating Oreos in the pantry after they were fighting.  I have half a thyroid, PCOS, and had my gallbladder out in January.  Since the surgery I have gained 30 lbs.  Those of you who know anything about hypothyroidism and PCOS, losing weight is extremely difficult.  

I have tried every diet you can think of that doesn't involve food delivery.  Weight watchers, keto, Atkins, low fat high carb, and now paleo.  I'm sick of being disgusted with my body, but I'm also sick of the dieting mentality I'm stuck with.  I even tried giving up the diet mentality in April but ended up gaining 10 lbs because I didn't deny myself anything.

I'm at my wits end.  The only time I have ever had success in weight loss was when I wasn't even trying.  I would eat a #1 from McDonald's every morning, walk a mile on campus to get to my classes, then eat a McDonald's cheeseburger (the tiny ones) for dinner.  I never denied myself anything, but I was on Zoloft, which killed my appetite.  I would go out to eat and have two bites and be "full" (nauseated).  I dropped 50 lbs in 8 months doing this.  Only downside is that while the Zoloft killed my appetite, it killed my personality and sex drive, too.

I'm currently in counseling and have discussed my issues with food, but simply depriving myself of things leads to me bingeing later, even if I try to acknowledge and think through the feelings I'm having.  I've tried CBT, I'm on anti-depressants still (Celexa), along with medicine for PCOS and hypothyroidism.

I don't know why I'm putting this here. I don't know what I need from you, /r/loseit.  I just know that I had to tell someone my feelings. Maybe I've convinced myself I'm never going to lose the weight, never going to get pregnant, and live a miserable life because of it.  When I was at 170lbs in 2010, I was the most content I've ever been in my life despite having zero personality.  I loved my body and had confidence.  

TL;DR: I've tried everything and am close to giving up.  I don't know what to do.


Edit: Thanks for all the encouragement and advice.  If you want to add me on MFP my username is lefoll.  I have taken what everyone has said to heart and am not going to give up.  I may not stay on the whole30 wagon for much longer, but I'll be making wiser choices and I'm going for a walk (at least) tonight. 




 I've read /r/fitness 's FAQ, I've read multiple articles on strength training, from both bodybuildling.com and other sites.  I get the basic breakdown:

Powerlifting: low reps/high weight
Bodybuilding: mid reps/mid-high weight
stabilizing: high reps/low-mid weight

I'm obese (5'5", 25yo, 225lbs) and cardio has never been good for me.  I'm an absolute beginner.  I've read things on 5x5, I've read starting strength, etc... but I'm still clueless.  I had a trainer last year who worked me out on the cable machines, but in all honesty I'd rather work with dumbbells/barbells. 

I plan on watching lots of videos before I join the Y on Friday (payday).  Any other suggestions?  I'm currently eating 90% paleo (2 meals/week where I don't eat paleo, and even then I don't eat rice/pasta/bread).   




 Back in January, [the Houston Chronicle announced](http://www.chron.com/business/article/7-Eleven-fans-might-thank-heaven-for-Houston-4168335.php) that 7eleven was looking to come back to Houston.  One of the stores is off 249   Grant, which showed up on 7-eleven.com.  Now the store no longer shows up and it seems to be staying a Chevron.

Anyone aware of the goings on in regard to this? 




 I worked for a company for 10 months and had a company-matched 401k  they set up for me.  Now that I am no longer with the company, can I do anything with this money?  How do I go about transferring money to an IRA from this 401k if it's associated with the company I used to work for? 




 I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2006 at the age of 18.  Since then I've been off and on Metformin 4 different times.  As soon as I get up to 1500mg/day, my stomach just rebels.  It's horrible. I get pale, cold sweats, and have to be near a bathroom at all times.

In 2011 I lost 50 pounds but have gained all of it back.  My doctor suggested trying Metformin ER again, since I'm eating healthy and working out to no avail. For the last 12 months I have been attempting to eat very low carb but fail at every turn. Now I'm just eating lots of  vegetables and meats with fruit for dessert.    

My husband and I have been (casually) TTC for the last 12 months with nothing.  I have a period every month, but my insurance doesn't cover any fertility specialists so I can't get additional testing done at this time.

I'm currently on 1000mg/day but the dosage may go up in the future.  If I do go up, should I fight through the symptoms? Do they get any better over time? 

I'm not on anything else, no Spiro or BC.  

Any opinions on this? Any successful weight loss stories with Metformin?  




 I got a new job that I start on Wednesday.  I'm leaving my current job with a wells fargo 401k, but I'm not sure which 401k my new company will pay into.  Will they pay into my existing 401k set up by my current company? Or will I have to transfer the funds into a new 401k? 














 Any suggestions on keto popsicles? I've seen suggestions online for coconut milk, which I plan on trying tomorrow afternoon with some strawberries.  Anyone else have any keto (and lower calorie) popsicle recipes or suggestions?  Seeing as how popsicles are mostly fruit-based I'm at a loss. 




 My husband and I have been discussing this as we've been watching through all the seasons lately.

The set and character's outfits make it seem like the show takes place earlier, but there are pop culture references and modern tech.  

Some more things that lead us to believe it takes place earlier is that all the veterans have fought in WWI, not WWII, and the KGB still exists.  The KGB was dissolved in 1991.

Archer's Dodge Challenger looks like the old Challengers, regardless of new tech.

Guns are also very accurately portrayed, there doesn't seem to have been a modern gun.  There was one Barrett M82 and a TEC-9, both of which were produced in the 1980's.

We always look really deep into these things.  I mean, it's a fictional universe, yes, so this is pretty much ridiculous. 









 I'm talking the kind you can cook at your table.  I know the Gessner part of Spring Branch has a lot from yelp, but the reviews are all over the place.  I also am the whitest of white and know absolutely no Korean which I've heard can be a hindrance at some particular establishments.  As long as the staff and I can communicate to get food on my table, I'm good.

I also have never had Korean food before, but I like trying new things even if I don't like the taste. The experience is good enough :) 




 So I recently discovered my love for making crochet accessories.  Scarves, necklaces, bracelets, etc... but I don't have much of the softer yarn that many people prefer for scarves and the like.  Are there any crochet projects that yarn like the Red Heart Super Saver skeins are good for? My husband calls it squeaky yarn because if you knit too tightly with it, it squeaks. It's rougher and itchier.

Patterns or just ideas are welcome :)  I haven't jumped into amigurumi yet, but plan on doing so soon.   









 I was prescribed Lortab for painkiller after my gallbladder removal surgery.  For the past couple days since the surgery I've been staggering my meds (taking 0.5 mg Klonopin and 20mg Celexa at 5am and Lortab at 8am) but today I took them all together.  Then stupid me looked up the drug interactions between my meds and Lortab and now I'm freaking out.

I keep trying to tell myself if there were any danger my surgeon wouldn't have prescribed Lortab or told me to keep taking my meds but of course my inner voice is not helping.  And today's the first day since my surgery day that I'll be alone at home since my husband goes back to work today.

Anyone had any experience with hydrocodone and anxiety meds? Or just some reassuring words? 




 Backstory: currently being treated for anxiety and depression with medication and CBT.  Has been working wonders.  Before starting treatment in October I had missed work because I couldn't get myself out of bed, usually a day a week.  My boss has been great up until now about it, not requiring any "excuses" and letting me work from home.

Now I have gallbladder disease which has led me to multiple ER visits and a surgery that's coming up soon.  I'm just afraid that this will be the last straw and I'll end up jobless.  I really love this job and am working my butt off from home when I do stay home.

Any advice? Maybe it's my anxiety getting to me, or maybe my fears are legitimate.  I guess fear of the unknown is a big thing for me. 




 I nominate Brown Betty. 




 Where the fuck did Jennie, Strax, and Madam Vasatra come from?  They were there for A Good Man Goes to War but they never got an introduction other than "a debt is to be repaid."  

Was this covered somewhere and I missed it or is it one of Moffat's "clever" attempts at foreshadowing timey wimeyness? 




 My newly prescribed Klonopin to help my anxiety until my Celexa saturates in my system has been working pretty well, until this morning.

Never in my life have I had to leave work because of anxiety.  My main trigger is my heart rate and the thought of dying alone.  

So last night I ate way too much, which happens about once a month.  I was up with stomach pain, puking, and general discomfort for 3 hours.  So I called into work saying I'd be late, no big deal.  I take my medicine before I leave for work (2 hours late) but I can already tell it's going to be a bad day.

On my way to work I can't stop checking my pulse.  It's fast.  I get to work, sit down, drink water, and it's still fast.  I do my breathing exercises, I try to distract myself with work and it's still at least 120bpm.  This just keeps the negative feedback loop going on in my brain.  So I call my husband, because he can help calm me down sometimes.  I do everything I've been taught to do and nothing is helping. I decide Klonopin hasn't started working yet so I try to wait it out for 2 hours while having a panic attack.

No dice.

My boss is out of the office basically 10 minutes after I get there so I jot him an email saying for personal reasons I have to leave for the day.  I tell my coworker I can work from home if anything needs to be done and I pack up my shit and head out the door.  

My heart is still up to around 105bpm, which is better, but still not ideal.  My brain has stopped working that stupid loop it does so well.  I think my Klonopin is working now.  I've just resigned myself to the fact that all that discomfort from last night has my HR up.  No chest pains, no shortness of breath, and my doctor says to just wait a couple days and if it's not back down to come in.


I FUCKING HATE THIS.  I shouldn't be in danger of losing my job but the doubt in my mind is always going.  Yesterday was perfect.  So perfect.  No anxiety, lots of fun, no worries.  Then fucking bam... today. 




 I've searched rigzone but can't find anything that fits his lack of qualifications.  I've sent him tons of job listings that he doesn't particularly qualify for but they may overlook as he has some experience with unrelated electronics and structural design (1 year).  We live in one of the perfect cities for this but have no idea where to start.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 









 This includes withdrawals from pills.

I took 200mg of Zoloft for depression 2 years ago and it eliminated my personality and my appetite.  I lost 50lbs on it (which was good, I was at 220) but I was a shell of my former self.  The withdrawal was nothing like what others have experienced. No brain zaps, no shakes or sweats, no vomiting, nothing.  It was just normal for me.  

I tried Zoloft again recently for my general anxiety at a lower dosage (started at 25mg and upped to 50mg) but it actually made my anxiety worse this time around so I just stopped taking it.  I'm going back for a reevaluation tomorrow. 




 Background info: We are newlyweds (8 months) and bring home about $52k after taxes, insurance, 401k, etc... We have $30k in debt.  We have only my 401k which just kicked in last month. We rent an apartment and are moving to a less-expensive one in March when our current lease is up.  We own our cars outright, and as of right now my student loans qualify for income based repayment.  The minimum payment required per month is $0, since we file taxes separately. 

We have no savings. We spend frivolously, convincing ourselves we'll be fine and we have the money to buy ____. Truth be told, if we have any sort of financial crisis my in-laws would probably help us out, but I don't want to get to that point. 

I'm considering attending Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University in January because I'm so desperate to have an emergency fund and save up for a down payment and other things.  

Our biggest struggle is that our rent eats up the first paycheck of the month and then some. We live in a city where the cost of living is pretty low for the US, so finding that cheaper apartment isn't difficult.  

I'm curious if any resources really worked for you, or any advice you have for us.  Did anyone try FPU? I'm aware that FPU is biblical, but I'm more concerned with the results than anything else.  Not to mention my husband and I are (somewhat lapsed) Christians

Thanks for any help. 




 For me, it's either when they pace someone in the other person's blind spot or riding their ass.  I don't have that much trust in other drivers. 




 No sex-ed is the best sex-ed! 









 I've been attempting keto for the last 6 months but can't really get the hang of it.  I have metabolic syndrome and a voracious appetite, so eating what I want on keto hasn't been beneficial with the calorie-dense foods.  

Today I started eating every 2.5-3 hours, having no more than 200 calories.  This has satisfied my desire to eat all the time, as well as helped me stay under my 1300 calorie limit.

Anyone else have to do this or something similar in order to keep on track?  

I've heard for the last 6 months that my appetite will go away, just wait it out.  Never happened.  I'm not willing to wait anymore, because I've gone 6 months without losing a single pound.  Granted, I haven't gained any weight, but going to the gym 3x a week and working out with a personal trainer once a week... I'm not happy at all. 









 Let's share our shame. 









 So I have borderline polycystic ovaries, but none of my blood tests reflect PCOS symptoms.  I have hirsutism, though, so my RE put me on spironolactone.  I'm also on synthroid, but that's unrelated.

I'M SO FUCKING EXHAUSTED. I'm on 100mg spiro.  Does anyone else have this problem?  I saw one of the side effects listed online is fatigue, but this is ridiculous. 




 Okay, so basically since I went to college in 2006 I haven't been extremely involved in churches.  I would go about once a month.  Since I got married 7 months ago my husband and I have been once.  I want to be involved in a church but both my husband and I have a hard time being involved in a church whose services we really don't enjoy whatsoever or a church we disagree with on our big points.

We talked about this last night and my husband describes himself as a lapsed Christian.  He believes what Christianity teaches overall, but he can't find a church that meets his needs.  

First of all, we're in Texas.  Lots of churches I've been to here are preaching that homosexuality is horrific and anyone not heterosexual is essentially going to hell.  We don't share that belief at all.  

Second, the whole evolution thing.  We are *not* YEC's, and we'd like to find a church that embraces science and evolution instead of being apathetic or strongly YEC. 

Third, the layout.  We're so over singing 3 songs and hearing a preacher tell us stories from his personal life that somehow connect to the message of "Jesus saves" that he's preaching. My husband really enjoys the liturgical side of worship even more than the message itself.

Basically my husband and I want a place where we can get into the Greek and Hebrew of the message, getting more into the context of the passages and knowing what was really going on at the time and what it really means.

We believe the Bible in its original languages is infallible. We are neither Calvinist nor Arminian, we are Lutheran in that sense, but we don't need a Lutheran church.  We just don't want someone that will shove either Cism or Aism down our throats because we don't find that important whatsoever.

I've looked into home churches in my area and I found one and have messaged the pastor about these issues, but I'm willing to bet that his answer will not be what I'm looking for.

Any suggestions?   




 I got a tooth extracted today.  That would be it for me. 









 OK so I use MFP to track my calories.  It essentially "nets" my calories so that my net consumption is 1350 calories.  That is, if I burn 219 calories, my food calories will jump up to 1569 calories.  Should I still just stick to 1350 and have those other 219 be deficit?  I want to lose weight healthily and I'm not sure if not eating those 219 will hinder anything.  




 In late march I had a debilitating panic attack.  I was dizzy, heart rate was up, I was pacing for 3 hours straight.  I went to the ER and got diagnosed with an inner ear infection.  Vertigo along with anxiety are very common symptoms of this infection, so I kept having mini panic attacks due to my loss of equilibrium.  

I went back on 12.5 mg of Zoloft, as I had been off it for 3 months when the attack hit.  Ever since then I've had GAD, being on the brink of an attack all day, every day.

Recently I started working out and went off the Zoloft and lo and behold, no more anxiety at all.  It cooled down to about 85 the other day (for Houston that's a nice day) and I closed my eyes walking outside and felt genuinely happy for the first time in over 2 years.  

Pretty sure the Zoloft and sedentary lifestyle was causing my constant anxiety.

I just wanted to celebrate this on this subreddit, which has been helpful in these past 6 months dealing with this shit. 




 I got one on Sunday for my birthday and I'm desperate to make something.  I've made mousse, but I'm pretty burnt out on that dessert.  I don't need dessert recipes. I've been looking online but found one or two threads on low carb friends, but I knew all those recipes. 

Thanks! 




 I've had an iPhone since the release of the iPhone 3.  My iPhone 4 hardware has started crapping out, with the home and lock buttons being unresponsive half of the time, and the camera being faulty. I was looking forward to the iPhone 5 but now that most of its features are standard on other phones, I'm not as excited.  

Anyways, I can hold out for another month or so with my crappy iPhone, assuming the Note II comes out in mid-October.

I'm just very new to looking at phones for hardware and new with the Android OS.  I like the larger display the Note offers as well as the pen.      But I'm not sure I'd be utilizing it fully as it was intended.  

I appreciate any help. 




 Back story:  I was on 200mg of Zoloft (for depression mostly) for 18 months and weaned myself off under a doctor's supervision, as I was a zombie and it was driving my then-fiance away. I had some major panic attacks for the  first time in my life starting in March of this year.  For about 2 months I was having them 3 times a week.  Then they waned down some to only once or twice a month, after going back on ~12.5mg of Zoloft again.  I think this was a mistake, as I wasn't under a doctor's supervision because I didn't have insurance at all. 

Today was one of those times where I had a panic attack for a good 3 hours. Even the calming manatee didn't help. I think I may have unevenly broke my pill last night and took too much, but I just felt extremely lightheaded, my vision was all fucked up, and I felt especially disconnected from reality.  My brain was not working right and it freaked me out.  I couldn't think of the words I was trying to say, I wasn't making the connection with words I read in emails and on paper.  It's like, I knew the words but the information wasn't making it to my brain. The disconnect is what gets me the most.  I don't feel like myself anymore.  I feel disconnected for the majority of my day and I feel on edge all the fucking time. After today, I've now got an enormous headache, probably because my brain was working overtime today.

So today I made an appointment with a psychiatrist for the first time.  My old GP originally prescribed me Zoloft but now I've had enough.  I need an adjustment.  I need to feel normal again.  I just don't want to keep feeling like I'm going down the rabbit hole into insanity anymore. 




 F, 25 yo, 5'5", 193lbs.  

I just started CrossFit yesterday.  I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it, even though I felt like I was going to die towards the end.  The workout was scaled down.  I was reminded, however, why I've not stuck with working out before.

About 5 minutes into any vigorous workout, my chest starts burning.  My heart rate is pretty elevated but my doctor says it's nothing to be worried about (175 max).  I've breathed through my nose, through my mouth, breathed deeper, but nothing seems to alleviate this.  

This is ultimately what stopped my previous work out attempts.  About 2 years ago I got to week 3 of C25K but couldn't progress farther, despite doing week 3 for 2 months straight.  The chest burning was too much. I noticed last night a bit of wheezing for about 30 minutes after the workout was completed.

Could this be athletic asthma?  Or am I just a wuss and need to push through it? I plan on visiting a GP in the next couple weeks, but I wanted to hear some opinions. 




 I just got a full face wax for the first time and the poor woman had to tweeze for 10 minutes after the waxing itself was done.  I usually pluck my chin and any other hairs I feel but it's been getting out of control lately and my self esteem is suffering.  I still have to sit here and pluck the ones that were recently plucked.

Anyways, how do you deal? 









 I am a workout beginner.  I've tried to go do cardio at the gym before but I get bored.  I feel this sort of program will be more beneficial to me as it requires actively tracking progress.  

The thing is, I've never lifted weights before.  Ever.  I feel CF would help me learn how to lift properly and be a good program to get involved with, but is CF for beginners as inexperienced as myself? 

Stats: 25f, 5'5, 194lbs. 









 All we know, as confirmed by some [obscure article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19258348) on BBC's news site, is that it's airing in September.

The only source I've seen saying it's 1 September is some blogspot post and other articles that say BFI attendees say 1 September was confirmed.  If you're going to claim it's a specific date, please include some legitimate source, preferably a BBC or Steven Moffat confirmation. I'm just very skeptical of this date that's being thrown around. 




 Title says it all.  I had a GP since birth who I recently left because he started charging a monthly fee.  Long story, but when I was with him I expressed an interest in seeing a psychiatrist.  He told me not to, because of certain tactics psychiatrists use vs. counselors.  He didn't want someone trying to get me on a cocktail of medications when I really only needed one and some good CBT.

So now I'm running out of Zoloft and I need to get my dose readjusted.  Do I go see another GP and tell him/her my situation and ask for a reassessment of my medications?  I'm on 25mg of Zoloft.  Without my meds I'm irritable, on edge, and anxious.  If I break my 50mg pill unevenly and take more than half I'm anxious, lightheaded, and can't stop zoning out.

I know y'all aren't doctors and I need to see one, but I just need some form of feedback so I'll know what to expect. 




 Do they offer sugar free flavorings? I'm currently sipping a peach sprite zero and am thinking its full of sugar.  














 Do you put heavy cream in your tea instead of milk or just drink it plain?  I'm an American and I used to drink coffee but the caffeine has started making me jittery and exacerbating my anxiety.  I know cream + coffee = greatness but not sure about tea + cream. Specifically Earl Grey. 




 Never fails. Just need to vent. I have to get up at 5:45am so I can get ready for my first day at a new job. Been tossing and turning since 1am, managed to get 30 min of sleep but otherwise laying here doing nothing. I'm not even very nervous, compared to other fits of anxiety. Just can't sleep. This always happens, and my first day goes by in a fatigue haze.  I can't take energy supplements bc they exacerbate my anxiety. Blah. 

Thanks for listening. 

UPDATE: THIS JOB ROCKS! The orientation this morning was extremely boring, but I love my boss and the few coworkers I've met so far.   




 I guess amenorrhea is a very common symptom of PCOS, but it's never been that prominent in me.  Mine comes **on average** once every 30 days.  Sometimes it's a little later. Sometimes a little earlier. But it seems most on here talk about how they go over 3 months without having one if they're not on BC. 

On that same topic, I know I should ask a doctor the following question, but I'm working on getting short term health insurance at the moment.  Because my periods aren't irregular, does that mean I'm fertile? I figure me getting a period every 30 days or so means I'm ovulating once in that time period.  

Feel free to discuss you periods in this thread, and thanks in advance for any answer to my question!   




 I'm tutoring a student in calculus III, offering a refresher course for him to re-take it in the fall.  He's an engineering and physics double major, and he loves applications of math vs. pure theory.  He's only taken mechanics, no pure engineering courses yet.

Obviously basic mechanics can be used with the basics of vectors, but when it comes to directional derivatives, gradients, and curl I'm having difficulty thinking of applications that he could realistically do.  I have a BS in math, so the theory part really interested me more.

 




 Usually I tutor people who are struggling with coursework. The guy in tutoring today is definitely a high achieving student, he just had a bad teacher and lost his zeal for the subject. To make things worse, in trying to secure a job with his father's company. I've been commissioned to reignite a passion for math, something that I don't know if I can do. I always second guess myself. Right now I'm worried that I'm not prepared enough, that I won't be able to meet the expectations, that I ultimately won't get the position I want. 

Thanks for listening.  




 Okay, I started keto April 15.  I've had PCOS for about 6-7 years but haven't taken my medication.  Recently I fell off the wagon after having absolutely no success on keto and actually having it exacerbate my anxiety.  I've been eating still lower carb than before keto, but only because carbs have started to frighten me.  I had one bout of a high-carb meal and felt extremely hyperglycemic. 

Anyways, basically what happened through my 75 days of keto was I lost the initial water weight the first 2 weeks.  After that I had nothing.  I was fluctuating around the same weight (193 lbs) the entire time, no matter what I did.  I went to /r/keto for help multiple times, resulting in me trying IF, fat fasting, water increase, weight training, everything.  Nothing was working.

So when I fell off the wagon I decided to start taking my Metformin again.  It hasn't caused the digestive issues it had before, thankfully, but I need some motivation.  I need some inspiration.  

TL;DR: Keto didn't work for me the first time for 75 days when I was unmedicated.  Now I'm back on medicine but I need to hear some stories from ladies with PCOS who have had success using keto and Metformin to lose weight. 









 Anyone else have any type of anxious feelings upon waking?  Mine is only after waking from a nap, and it's gotten to the point where I"m afraid to take a nap because I don't want to feel like this.  It just happened again and it sucks. 




 I already feel better.  It's so wonderful to be able to air what makes me anxious to a compassionate professional! I've already got some things to help me out if and when the anxiety creeps up on me.  So ready for these weekly sessions! 




 I either put it on too thin, where I need 2-4 coats, or too thick, where it looks awesome but isn't dry after 20 minutes (still a little goopy).  What am I doing wrong? 

Also, can clear polish substitute a top coat? I can't afford to buy a good one right now, so should I use the clear or just forego top coat until I can get a legit top coat? 




 One would think I'm wired perfectly for keto.  I have PCOS, I'm insulin resistant, and I'm chubby.  Nothing else has ever worked before.

So here's my story.

As per my stats in my flair, I started 4/15.  First week, lost 12 pounds of what I'm assuming was mostly water weight.  After the first week, nothing. I tried IF, fat fasting, cutting artificial sweeteners, upping protein, upping fat, weight training, light cardio... you name it, I tried it.  I was drowning myself in water every day.  

Then, about 10 days in my brain became foggy.  Researched it on here, upped my potassium via V8 low sodium, lite salt, swiss chard, cream of tartar, and avocados.  Met all my electrolyte goals on MFP but my perception was still off.  

Then it happened.

This change in perception, along with the dizziness and light-headedness, caused my anxiety to skyrocket.  I've never had full-blown panic attacks until the beginning of May, when I started having them almost every other day.  I went to urgent care walk-in clinics twice, got put on beta blockers, but I still *felt* wrong.  I saw the world differently than I had before.  Even my regular GP couldn't give me an answer as to why I was feeling like I was, so I made an appointment with a therapist.  

Friday, June 1, after feeling utterly miserable anxiety-wise for the last 40 days or so (the requisite amount of time it takes the brain to adjust to ketones), my husband took me on a date. Long story short, I cheated and had about 40g net carbs.  Figured I'd wake up the next day out of ketosis and feeling miserable.

I woke up the next morning, sure enough, out of ketosis.  But there was something different.  **I felt normal** and I was perceiving the world like I used to, no more dizziness or lightheadedness, no more postural hypotension.  So I went on the internet and realized that in some people with serotonin deficiencies, keto can exacerbate anxiety like nobody's business.  This increase in anxiety was causing me to stress out, which is why (I assume) I wasn't losing any weight at all.

So I'm sorry keto.  For my own mental health I can't continue this.  Don't worry, I'm not going low-fat diet or anything, I think I'll just try paleo for a while.  You know, adding in vegetables with a higher net carb count, maybe increasing my carb macro to 15% while increasing my cardio a little.  I'll still hang around here for food inspiration.

*I'm just not willing to sacrifice my sanity for 20g carbs per day. I'm now just sticking with under 50g.  Some might still consider this keto, some may not.*


**TL;DR: After 7 weeks of keto, my anxiety had skyrocketed, I was foggy, and I wasn't losing weight, despite my efforts to change all of these through advice sought on /r/keto.  Had a minor cheat Friday and felt normal for the first time in 6 weeks, researched, and realized those with serotonin deficiency can have anxiety exacerbated through extremely low-carb diets.  Upping my carb count to 50g and wanted to post this in case someone in the future has a similar problem.**



Edit: **I just wanted to share this in case anyone ever goes through it as well, they can see what happened to another person.** I'm not saying keto is unhealthy (quite the contrary), I'm just saying it doesn't *always* make anxiety and depression better, and it *can* have some adverse side effects depending on your body chemistry and the medications you're taking.  


Thank you so much for the kind words and encouragement.  I love /r/keto 




 I mean, being suicidal isn't a qualifier for every depression case.  I've actually got a little hypochondria and have a fear of death, but every time I come across something about depression on reddit, someone mentions how they want to kill themselves or how many times they've tried.  I never have and I never will, I just have a serotonin deficiency that causes depression.

It's kinda weird that I feel alone even on the /r/depression subreddit. 




 I'm sick of spending $11 on a pound of Bob's almond meal at H-E-B.  I make holy grail pizza at least twice a week.  I'm a newlywed and can't afford to spend that much on almond meal.  We have a crappy food processor and  are really busy so I'd rather just buy some and not make my own.

Free/cheap shipping would be awesome, too.  Should probably mention I'm in the states, if you didn't catch that by the H-E-B 




 Hey all, long time no talk.  Sorry I haven't been as active here as I used to be, but life caught up with me.  

Anyways, I have a question and am not good at brainstorming these things on my own.

My husband has felt the calling to work in a ministry of some form since shortly after he became a Christian.  Recently, however, he's become very disillusioned to working in an actual church due to the politics that go on.  He doesn't want to deal with the bigotry of individual people, the limitations of what he can speak about so that he doesn't upset some people, the emails after a sermon from some upset congregation member, the list goes on.  This can extend to foreign missions, too, but he's been pretty clear that with the gifts God gave him, he's pretty sure the call isn't for foreign missions anyways.

What are some other roles that don't require specific denominational affiliation, don't require answering to hundreds of people, yet still allow him to get his M.Div and spread the love of Christ through his actions and responsibilities?

The only thing I could come up with is a chaplain for a hospital, which he expressed some interest in.  I just thought I'd get some feedback from you guys and gals since our brainstorming sessions have ended up empty.

Note: while we're trying to volunteer our time through our church and other things, this needs to be a paid position, one that pays enough to contribute enough to raise a family on (along with mine).  We don't expect it to pay a lot, but we're hoping more than the $23k/year youth ministry positions we're finding in the ELCA and LCMS. 









 I've been on keto for 5 weeks now and, following the initial water weight, have not lost another pound. I'm consistently under 20g carbs, am drinking enough water, am meeting my macros and calorie goals, have tried IF, fat fasting, and cutting out artificial sweeteners. 

I've measured myself and haven't lost any inches. I'm literally the same place I was after losing the water weight. If I had lost the 10 pounds spread out over 5 weeks this post wouldn't be here. 

The only way I'm not perfectly meeting my macros is on the net carbs. I'm usually under 20g, around 10 or 15.  I eat spinach salads every day and broccoli at night, so I'm getting enough veggies. I'm on a probiotic and multivitamin. 

What gives? I have insulin resistance and PCOS, so this lifestyle should be perfect for me. My sugar addiction is gone but the weight won't come off at all. 

The only thing I can think of is that I should try the last resort: working out. My nemesis. I've never had good endurance or diligence when it came to working out and I was put on beta blockers this last week so it worries me a bit. 

I just need advice. I've posted my food logs before and adjusted my macros as advised. They're never perfect by someone's standards but they're pretty damn close. 

Help me, /r/keto. You're my only hope  




 I've been on the /r/keto diet for a month now and have realized how expensive it can be, with all the meat and produce purchases.  I plan on going to [Canino](http://www.caninoproduce.com/) on Saturday to pick up some veggies, but I've also heard just hispanic markets in general are good for meat and veggies.  Which ones are the best and can cater to someone with extremely limited Spanish skills?  I went into a carniceria once looking for slab bacon and got looks of confusion from the butchers there, and I'd like to avoid that in the future. 




 My husband has a psychological addiction to a pot-like substance.  We got married in March.  I have been asking him to cut back for a long time, for probably 18 months now but my prodding became serious in the past 2 months.  Every time we get into a discussion about it, the topic always turns to why I don't like it, and how my reasons aren't enough to warrant him quitting.  He can see himself doing this for the rest of his life.  He claims if pot were ever legalized, he'd use the real stuff.  He claims to use this fake shit because of work and other legal issues.

He doesn't smoke around me, he's granted me that and I'm grateful for the compromise.  He smokes before work, on his lunch break, and he smokes after I go to bed while he plays video games.  Now, this isn't to say I don't understand, I was the exact same.  I smoked this shit for 2 years before a new blend gave me the worst anxiety attack of my life and I gave it up.  He made a deal with me to only buy a certain amount every week and he's broken that in the past 2 weeks.  He always has excuses ready, like he was sick and it makes him feel better so he smoked a lot one day, a fight we got in stressed him out so he smoked a lot that day too, etc…

I don't like it because I don't want his life to revolve around this substance.  I also don't want to deal with the financial repercussions if, God forbid, one of us loses our job or something happens.  It's getting to the point where I'm paranoid about him going behind my back and breaking the compromise by getting cash back on debit transactions in order to go buy this stuff without my knowledge, despite his promise to include me on all substance purchases.  The ideal situation would be that a) I just lose all concern about this and b) he stay within the boundaries of our compromise for financial reasons.

He was raised by an unbearably nagging mother, so any time I seriously get in his face about this he just shuts down in order to shut me up.  That's what worked with his mother and it infuriates me.  I don't want to annoy him and be on his case constantly; I don't want to be his mother.

TL;DR: Husband is addicted to pot-like substance, denies its control over his life. I'm getting paranoid and would love any advice to break me out of this paranoia.  To be completely honest I just don't want to care anymore, but I have a history of anxiety and I have a hard time controlling my thoughts.  

Thanks for the advice, everyone.  This post may have come off as a "help me convince my husband to stop or tell me what to do to make it go away." I meant it to be "I know my thoughts are irrational so can someone please give me some advice to deal with this better?" 4nonymo was the most helpful in this.  Many of your points have been brought up in our 5 fights about it and they've all been successfully resolved, but my anxious and nagging feelings remained.  The only course of action left is for me to go get some form of therapy to help deal with my mental health.   














 25/f, in case it matters

My anxiety used to be just very occasional, seemingly mild panic attacks. 

Then one day in late March, I took a nap after dinner and woke up to the most horrific panic attack of my life.  It lasted 3 hours, then I finally went to the ER.  They said I might be dehydrated, and then eventually discovered an ear infection.

Apparently the nerve that goes from the inner ear to the brain, the one that causes dizziness with this, also goes to the part that triggers anxiety.  So I had to deal with anxiety and dizziness for the next 10 days or so.

I also started /r/keto around the time my dizziness subsided.

Ever since mid-April I've had this constant mild anxiety, where my resting heart rate is 85-105 bpm.  I have random dizzy spells.  I've been off Zoloft for 7 months and ran out of lorazepam during my ear infection, and I can't get another script for a while due to a medical insurance snafu.  

My anxiety is in the form of hypochondria and doomsday thoughts.  I can't drive on the freeway after work because I'm terrified of an accident.  I'm constantly checking my pulse.  I have anxiety when I wake up from naps, so I don't nap anymore.  It seems that my depression is no longer wreaking havoc over my life, just the anxiety.

It's driving me crazy.  I've tried l-theanine, but I'm afraid to take it too much because of the hypochondria.  I'm picking up magnesium on the way home from work for both anxiety and digestive issues.  

**Could this still be due to the inner ear problem? What should I do? Any luck with OTC supplements??** 




 I've posted a couple links in the past few days that have my daily recordings of food, and a few people said my macros are off and I'm not getting enough protein.

So I went out and bought Jay Robb's chocolate whey protein powder, 1g net carbs per scoop.

Fucking shit kicked me out of ketosis.  

***FOR THE KETO ANALYSTS/EXPERTS:***Does it **really** matter that my macros aren't up to par all the time? I'm getting more fat than anything and staying below my carb ratio.  My protein is about 75% of what it should be, but I'm not getting all the way up there because I get really full really quickly.

[First tracking day](http://i.imgur.com/QLqmB.jpg)

[Second tracking day](http://i.imgur.com/eSIBq.jpg)

I'm just extremely frustrated, because I've been doing everything right and I've been stuck around 193 for the past 2 weeks now.  I'm a woman, my body shouldn't be comfortable at this weight.  Maybe I should take a walk tonight or something. 




 [I posted yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/to4ch/first_day_of_tracking_all_of_my_food_would_like/), asking for feedback of my first fully-tracked food day.

I tracked again, and I can't seem to get enough protein.  I ate a mass amount of shrimp for dinner and even then, not enough.  I want to stay away from protein powder, as I have a difficult time drinking disgusting things and I've yet to find one that is tasty.  

If I have to, I'll buy protein powder.  What are some other ways of getting in some more protein?

[Here's my food log from yesterday](http://i.imgur.com/eSIBq.jpg)

**I really appreciate you, /r/keto, for being here for me when I need your help.  Which is most of the time.** 




 I've had mild depression and anxiety for the past 10 years or so (since my teens).  About 7 months ago I weaned myself off of Zoloft, because I wanted to feel emotions again.  I wasn't very anxious until I had an ear infection recently, which somehow triggered my anxiety.  Now I have a constant mild anxiety regarding my health and safety. 

Anyways, I've read that 5-HTP is a good natural supplement that helps with mild anxiety and depression and was wondering if anyone uses it while doing keto and if there are any adverse side effects?

I have a theory as to why my anxiety has creeped back up and the weight hasn't been coming off easily: serotonin.  I think I'm serotonin deficient and there are studies that show that serotonin deficiency has an adverse effect on weight loss and weight control, and 5-HTP has shown to increase serotonin levels.  I used to get the serotonin from eating carby foods, because I was a sugar addict. I would feel awesome as I was eating sugary, carb-laden foods, but about 10 minutes afterwards would feel physically miserable from hyperglycemia (I've got PCOS and am insulin resistant).  

EDIT:  Thanks to everyone for the advice! I decided to give L-Theanine a go and got a bottle.  I took one about 30 minutes ago (6:25pm CST) and am already feeling **MUCH** more stable, especially given that my hypochondriac anxiety was very mild to begin with 









 It's really encouraging to see people losing 20 pounds in the first month.  But it's also frustrating to get through my own first month and only have lost 10 pounds.  I've basically plateaued since after the first week.  I've had a couple of cheat meals (one being yesterday), and it seems like it takes my weight forever to get back on track even though I'm pissing dark pink on the sticks and have smelly breath.

I posted a comment not too long ago about waiting to exercise until I'm down some more weight, but I decided with my current frustration to change my mind.  I'm starting some light weight training tonight with my husband.  I'm giving up most of the artificially sweetened things that were staples of my beginning keto diet.  

I have to remind myself that my progress will probably be slower than others', since in the past 18 months I've lost 50 pounds and gained 30 back.  I know yo-yo dieting has an effect on speed of weight loss, as well as my PCOS (and, therefore, insulin resistance), hypothyroidism, and IBS.  

One thing I will say for certain that I'm very pleased with: my sugar addiction is gone.  It was so bad before I got married and started keto that about twice a month I would have this enormous craving for cookies or cake and go to Wal-Mart to fulfill my desires.  For those of you with insulin resistance and former sugar addiction, you know this craving was basically insatiable.  You'd go, eat half the carton of oreos (or even the whole carton if it was a particularly bad one) and then feel like death was coming afterwards.  Now, I have that deathy feeling even after a small cheat.  I get tired, my eyes go cross, my anxiety creeps back up on me.  It's horrendous.  This morning, for example, I feel like death and an overly inflated balloon.  I had one of my sister's famous brownies yesterday and I felt like hell the rest of the day.  

So even though I'm frustrated at my lack of success, thank you, /r/keto, for curing my addiction. 




 I want to pre make bacon for breakfasts every week, but the bacon from my work cafeteria is so much more superior than my bacon. Theirs is thinner, crispy but not too crispy. No fatty ends. I've tried a bacon press, I've tried the oven. Nothing I do works as well. 

HELP!

Edit;  I think I discovered the problem. Even though I'm not buying "thick-cut bacon", it's too thick.  I think I need some specialty thinly sliced bacon. 









 I’ve had chronic constipation for as long as I can remember.  It’s been the black spot on my life that I can’t seem to get rid of, and now that I’m doing keto religiously, it’s gotten worse.  “Rabbit poops” are an apt term to describe my predicament up until a few days ago.  I’ve barely defecated since Sunday, so today after work I’m going to pick up a glycerin enema.  I eat a carbmaster yogurt every day, so I thought I would be getting all the probiotics I need.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

DISCLAIMER: **Don’t recommend fiber.**  It just exacerbates the problem by increasing the volume of my fecal matter.  That is, it clogs me even more.  My doctor has said to stay away from psyllium husks, benefiber, and even flaxseed meal because of this in the past.    

**EDIT** Thanks for all the advice!  I"m going to try the coconut oil in coffee in the mornings, but tonight I think I'll use more... uncomfortable and temporary solutions.  I need this out of me because I've gained 3 pounds and am bloated as fuck (*not* from water retention, I can tell)
 




 Background: I live in Houston, big metropolitan area, low cost of living (especially in the ‘burbs).  “Poor” credit score due to stupidity by my husband and myself with college credit cards, getting it sorted out, though it will take a while.

We currently rent an apartment here, spending about $1300/month on rent + utilities.  Two questions:

1. If we can’t get approved for credit cards, will we get approved for a mortgage

2. If we could get approved for a mortgage, would we be better off buying a house (probably $125k or less) or should we just stick with an apartment?

Which would be better for us financially (in a broad sense since I’m not sharing any more financial information), renting or “owning”?
 




 I bought a pack of these at HEB because they were cheap and beef, but I realized I have no idea how to cook them without many carbs.  My grandmother made these for me growing up occasionally, but she made them fried with gravy like [the pioneer woman](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2010/08/fried-round-steak/) and I'd rather not bust out the almond meal or any other keto carb alternative.  Any suggestions? 



















 I woke up this morning (10am) with a slightly elevated temp (98.9 for someone with unmedicated hypothyroidism due to marginal blood work and maxed out insurance).

30 minutes ago it had skyrocketed to 101.4.  I thought it was just a hangover from the double jack and diet I had last night (first drink since starting keto), but when the fever hit I was convinced it's something else.  I can't keep anything but smart water, vitamins, and aspirin down and I'm having the runs (TMI, sorry).  It's currently a birth-control induced shark week, as that may be important.

I've been in ketosis since 4/17 and have lost 10 pounds.  My husband is out getting me sugar free jello to try to keep down.

My question is this: **What should I do?** Since I'm in ketosis, I'm not retaining water so I'm afraid I'll get dehydrated.  Should I just sacrifice for the sickness and eat some carbs? I'm feeling absolutely miserable and honestly can't afford to visit a doctor other than a free clinic, so I'm coming to the keto experts first.

Again, I apologize for hounding r/keto with questions today (all 2 of them).

EDIT: Thanks for the responses.  I ate some tyson chicken nuggets (5 of them at 15g total) and am waiting for sugar free jell-o to set.  This was a couple hours ago so I feel better now and the sticks are saying I'm still in ketosis.  I'll be drinking the broth. 




 He's 6'2 and around 360, but he's seen the scale go up 5 pounds in our first week of weighing (3rd week of keto).  He says he's always hungry and is in ketosis all the time (I've seen the stix).  I figured since he's a big guy he doesn't have to watch his calories *that* much, based on what I've read in this subreddit for the past 3 months or so.  He also claims to be tired and hungry all the time.

He drinks about a gallon of water every day, salad for lunch, meats and cheeses and veggies for dinner. Usually skips breakfast bc he doesn't have time as he likes to sleep as late as possible. He has a couple sprite zeroes a night.  Meanwhile I've been losing on the diet faster than I've lost before.

Any advice? 




 This is for the husband, not me.  

He's a pretty big guy, 6'2 325lbs +.  We started keto last week and he started drinking more water specifically today.  Before today he would mainly stick to diet sodas or flavored sparkling waters ([these](http://www.amazon.com/Sparkling-ICE-Variety-Flavors-17-Ounce/dp/B003OZYVE4)). He said he feels fine otherwise and is in hardcore ketosis but his pee isn't diluting.  It's still dark, as if he's dehydrated.  Will it take a while for his body to properly hydrate itself? There are no other signs of renal failure, but I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem. 









 I'm bored at work and have been looking up different low carb bread options and need some opinions.

I loathe oopsie rolls.  I'm not a big egg fan and these taste too eggy for me.  I'm planning on trying [almond buns](http://cavemanketo.com/2012/02/15/faux-bread-quest-holy-grail-almond-buns/) tonight, and am excited because everyone has said in the comments that they taste very buttery.

Minute muffins are okay but I have IBS and they... slow things down even more.  Too much fiber can have adverse affects, even with extreme hydration.

 




 Back on the wagon, bought some more ketostix to keep myself motivated.  However, I realize the importance of being well hydrated on keto and so every time I try to use the ketostix, it registers a color between Neutral and Trace.  What should I do? Decrease water intake? Increase fats (even though I'm pretty much hitting my macros every day)?  I'm just frustrated from not knowing if I'm in ketosis.  

Disclaimer: I don't notice the acetone breath and dinosaur sweat pee, even when I did keto before and my ketostix registered a dark purple just after waking up.  I don't know why I can't recognize the other signs of ketosis, so honestly those physical signs don't really work for me. 




 Back story: I smoked Spice (fake weed) for about a year, every day.  I quit thankfully, and don't even smoke trees as I'm afraid of its effects on me. I recently had an inner ear infection that left me perpetually dizzy and anxious for a week.  I got over it and have recently weaned myself completely off Zoloft and Ativan.

I finally feel like I'm getting back to normal, but I'll have spells where my perception feels off.  Like I feel a little lightheaded, I feel like the world around me is wrong.  I see everything normally, it's just a feeling in my head.  It's *almost* enough to trigger mild anxiety, but not quite enough.  

Has anyone else experienced this? I figure if it's an effect from coming off Zoloft and Ativan then it might get a response on here.

Even if it doesn't apply to you, hey, you're awesome. 









 I obviously have a food addiction, most of which is associated with carbs.

I tried to start keto back in November, did it for a week, lost 10 pounds then gave up for some unknown reason.

Did the exact same thing in December.

I'm now realizing if I would have just sucked it up and suffered through the first couple weeks, I'd probably be down 30 pounds (or more) by now, but because I lacked the willpower necessary (and was a lazy fuck who made excuses), I'm still where I was in November.  Thankfully I haven't gained any since then.

Take this lesson, newbie ketoers, that if you stick with it you'll have progress pics to show off in just a few months.  

As for me, I've set goals for myself (a generous 8 months to lose 40 pounds).  I've discovered that I can like eggs if they're topped with salsa from my work's cafeteria. I've asked my new husband to encourage me to eat keto-friendly desserts (chocolate mousse... YUM) and have started parking in the garage across campus from my office so that I can get off my butt and work more.


Sorry, just needed to get that out there.  I'm starting fresh. Not putting a lot of pressure on myself.  Working through this carb addiction. Gonna be hotter stuff by my birthday in September. 




 If this doesn't belong here, please direct me to where I should post this.  There are just so many ent subreddits that I'm just clueless.

First, my back story:

I have anxiety and depression.  The anxiety isn't constant but was recently exacerbated by an inner ear infection.  For a span of about 18 months between 2008 and 2010 I smoked "legal" substitues.  Yes, I know about how unhealthy it is and I quit after the newer blends were giving me panic attacks.  I recently convinced my new husband to switch to real trees, but I'm afraid about partaking myself with what happened before with the legal stuff.  I know they're completely different, but I'm still concerned.

That being said, is medical marijuana prescribed for anxiety and depressive disorders?  I've read about long-term smokers developing anxiety, supposedly because of the long-term use.

I don't live in a medical state, but I figured the best way to get a somewhat scientific/medical answer is to ask:

Is medical marijuana prescribed for the relief of anxiety disorders?  I know it's used for depression.  

I appreciate you, Ents. 




 I've got anxiety, but thankfully my Zoloft keeps it pretty much under control.  

Friday night was hell for me, though.  I took a nap after dinner and woke up to what I thought was an immediate panic attack.  Rapid heart rate, the urge to get up and move, and a feeling of uneasiness lasted for **3 hours.**  I was in hell, so i had my husband take me to a non-hospital ER.  I was diagnosed as severely dehydrated, hooked up to an IV, and began to feel a little better.  Then the doctor finds what he thinks is a bacterial middle ear infection.

So I've been dizzy and my slight fever hasn't gone away even with antibiotics.  I went back to a regular doctor today.  She says I have a viral inner ear infection, explaining my dizziness and my fever being unresponsive to antibiotics. She gave me an EKG to see how my heart's doing, and just noticed a slight raise in HR (108 bpm), which usually happens to me when I'm sick or in pain.  

I've still been having very mild anxiety spells, though, followed by 30 minutes of me obsessively checking my pulse every 4 minutes or so.  Probably doesn't help the situation.  Does anyone know if this can be caused by the dizziness I'm experiencing?  Also, I've been having panic spells lasting about 3 minutes after I wake up, and I can't stay asleep for more than 90 minutes at a time.  My doctor couldn't explain this but I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this.

TL;DR - Inner ear infection causing dizziness, had mild panic spells (lasting max 30 seconds) since ER visit on Friday.  Mild panic spells for 3-5 minutes after waking.  Anyone else experienced this before? 




 I'll start this out by saying I'm not suicidal, nor have I ever been truly suicidal.  To be honest, I have a pretty good life.  I have a job with a major energy corporation, albeit a contract position.  I got married a week and a half ago to a wonderful supportive man who adores me. We adopted a kitten a few weeks ago.  

But my fucking job.  I loathe it.  I'm basically a data entry drone.  They're gradually giving me more responsibilities, but they haven't given any hints that I'll be offered a full time (salaried) position.  I'm an incredibly efficient worker and I finish my work pretty quickly (unintentionally).  When I finish my work, I'm sent home.  I fucking hate it, because as a newlywed and someone with student loans, I CANT AFFORD TO BE SENT HOME.  But I also can't slow down my work speed, I already have tried and realized I just can't.  

I don't want to go to a job where I have to interact with people.  I want to work from home.  I have incredible potential and know that I should be doing more with my life but by not getting an internship in college I royally screwed myself and am stuck at a soul-sucking job day in and day out, where my contract could end any day.

Not to mention I have had migraines the past couple months, and have missed more work than I should.  I got a talking to by my boss last week about it.  But yesterday she decided to come in hacking up a lung and now I'm feeling feverish.  It's just a shit ball rolling down shit hill and I just want to be out.

I'm sure most of us know what the job market is like right now; it's nearly impossible to find a job with limited experience.  This is my first professional job and I've only been there 3 1/2 months but I want something new.  

I don't know where I'm going with this... I just want a new job.  I want to work from home.

TL;DR: I'm too efficient at my job. I've been sick quite a bit recently and my boss just got me sick again, but I can't afford to miss work.  I want a more rewarding job, or to work from home, but the job market sucks.  My life is going well but I just feel like this job is sucking the life out of me. 




 I have generalized anxiety disorder and when I'm particularly nervous I seem to have trichotillomanic tendencies and pick at the tails of my eyebrows.  I'm getting married on Saturday so currently my eyebrows are sparse and my makeup artist will have to do some miracle eyebrow work.

We all know about the biting nails, chewing lips/cheeks, playing with hair... what about the weird things? 









 I've been working with data entry for the past 3 months.  I liked it, then I started getting more responsibilities, involving dealing with billing depts of other companies.  I am a nervous wreck when I'm on the phone with someone I don't know and it takes me about 10 minutes to write an email that should have taken 30 seconds to compose.  

I need tips on dealing with this business anxiety.  I can't be successful in the business sector if I'm like this forever. 









 Did you go out to eat? What did you eat? Was Valentine's a cheat day for you?

I started my festivities the night before, where my grandmother gave me a bag of mini-Snickers(curse you, grams!).  I had 4 over the course of a day, enough to kick me out of ketosis.  But I powered through after that without another cheat.

I fasted all day because of that then for dinner my fiance and I made [green chili and jack chicken](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/green_chile_jack_chicken.html), [fried "rice,"](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/fried_rice.html) and [low carb brownies](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/brownies.html).  

If you miss fried rice, you need to try that recipe for low carb fried rice.  It's amazingly delicious and so easy.

 









 I was prescribed metformin a couple years ago. The first time I tried taking it I had unpleasant digestive issues. My doctor promised me that I would lose weight, but I couldn't bear those side effects. I restarted keto on Tuesday and started Metformin again simultaneously. Not only do I not have keto flu or the digestive issues, I don't crave carbs. Last time I tried keto the cravings were way too strong and it was taking a toll on my stress levels. 

I last weighed myself on Sunday and I was 200.4. I weighed this morning and I'm already down to 196.8! I have never lost weight that fast before, even when I tried keto in November. 

I implore you to take your Metformin. I know the pills are big, chalky, and disgusting if you don't swallow them fast enough. But those side effects I can handle and are worth the increased rate of weight loss.  














 I hope I'm using those terms correctly...

Salaam!  Let me just start by saying I think Islam is a beautiful religion and I consider Muslims to be my religious cousins ( [borrowing from the familial relationship spoken of Christians in Scripture](http://www.openbible.info/topics/brothers_and_sisters_in_christ) ).  

Could someone explain why veils are worn? Would it be comparable to a Christian wearing a cross necklace, as an outward sign of devotion to God? 

There isn't much about this topic in the Bible except in the Pentateuch (Genesis-Deuteronomy) and an exerpt in [1 Corinthians 11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2011:2-16 version=ESV).  The verses in the Pentateuch are dismissed as ancient Israelite traditions that were done away with after the resurrection of Christ.  The 1 Corinthians excerpt is usually boiled down to 1st century Roman society, where a married woman always had her hair covered as a symbol of devotion to her husband.  A married woman who had her hair uncovered (or down) in public was seen as dishonoring her husband by acting like an unmarried woman.

I'm assuming the reasoning for wearing veils has nothing to do with honoring one's husband, as there were a few girls in hijabs at my middle school.  This leads me to believe it's an outward sign of devotion and honor to God (Allah).

Thank you for your help!  




 We've all seen the threads asking about good Christian music.  Something my friend and I love to do is recall really bad Christian music from our childhood and laugh about how cheesy it is.

Some examples:

[Mary, Did You Know? by Mark Lowry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0WIJw8JVeU)

[Screen Door by Rich Mullins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcvBsNcIzu4)

[Creed by Petra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bofa9mQa0)

We also laugh about Butterfly Kisses.   




 **And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.**

I guess it never struck me before, but this verse is saying love trumps even faith itself.  Faith is on what so many Christians nowadays rely.  I can't tell you how many times I've read 1 Cor 13 and for some reason, today, this jumped out at me.
