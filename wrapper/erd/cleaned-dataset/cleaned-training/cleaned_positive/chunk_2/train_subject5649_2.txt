 My name is Inigo Montoya.


You Killed my father.


Prepare to die. 




 Hell no it's not. Things eventually get better at some point, so knowing that helps. Thanks though 




 Back a while ago my catch phrase was always "See you on the flip-side" or "Maybe in another life." What people didn't realize was i was borderline suicidal, so those phrases had a whole deeper meaning to me. 


But things are kinda ok now. So i guess this is the flip-side.  




 Look. Buddy. I get it. Some monks up on a mountain top yelled out some crazy chants and now you're supposed to save us from the dragons. It's your destiny. But let me tell you a little secret; i've always known I would be a shop keeper. It was decided when I was very young I would run the village shop. You could say that's *my* destiny. 


Now, just because I knew my destiny, does that mean I was given all I needed scotch-free? Hell no. I had to work for it. No one taught me how to manage books, or keep inventory. I had to learn, work hard, and it's the time I spent working that made me into a great shop keeper; not the so-called "destiny" I was given. 


So listen here, buddy. I don't doubt you could be the hero. But me giving you these weapons for free? That's only gonna hurt you in the long run. The monks ain't gonna make you a hero; only you can do that through building yourself into the best possible warrior you can be. By working hard, and training. I get it, I get it. I may seem like a jerk, after all what kind of impact will having to work for four gold coins make? Well, not having to work will make you lazy. Let me tell you friend, it's a slippery slope. Soon it's four coins, then it's walking around enemies and cheating your way through dungeons, and suddenly you find yourself in front of a dragon trying to *cheat* your way out. 

So trust me, when you take the time to earn the money for this here broadsword, you aren't just buying a broadsword. You're buying character.
