 My sister believes that at some point Canada had a climate similar to one at the equator, before the Ice Age. I know that Canada has sub-tropical and arctic climates but I can't find any information to refute her. 

Is it possible that at some point in history northern part of North America had a desert or rainforest climate? 




 Ay Ah ah ah Ay! 




 The earth is 3 million miles (5 million km) closer to the sun in January than in July.
