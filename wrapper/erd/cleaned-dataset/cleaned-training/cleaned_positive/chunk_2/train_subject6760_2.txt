 I did not mean to make you feel worse and I'm sorry that I did. Because I suffer from depression (low self-esteem/lack of self worth/self-flagellation), I try to help anyone that I come across who is more vulnerable than I'm at that point in time. This is such an effort. I wish I could be there to hug you,  honestly do. 

I have been through similar painful situations and there has been someone or the other who has helped me. Talk to someone who is close (physically, emotionally, or both) to you. Sometimes you don't even need reciprocation - you just need to be listened to. 

Finally, I know this wouldn't make sense to you, as it wouldn't to me if someone else where saying this when I'm feeling like this - this one too shall pass.  









 A roller-coaster in which I always seem to be lost in the past or in the future, never living the moment. 




 Tigers. They are the most beautiful animal/thing on our planet. 




 I just shared my experience. I think that you should not expect people to change just because you want them to. 




 The ratings are really good. And the guys behind the fantastic podcast "The Skeptics Guide to the Universe" also think so. 




 Does anybody think that there is a movie deal behind this? 









 I don't quite understand. I have seen the USA flag used in costumes, hats, sporting apparel, etc. There must be more serious rules. On the other hand, in India, if you are using the flag for anything other than what it is, it is dangerous. 




 I don't see the codependence part in your post. I am in a codependent relationship for the last two years and at many times I have felt that I should really get out of it. I guess it is my fear that I won't find anyone else that keeps me going back. 




 When I try and imagine what it would be like to be my parents or my friends, I flinch at the thought of how disappointed they must be with me. :/ 




 This approach is what I'm gravitating toward, I think.
