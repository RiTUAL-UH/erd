 Thank you so much!!  




 It does help, thank you very much! 




 I have never thought of that - I'm already on reading books on makeup and color theory and following real working professionals online but never thought of practicing on friends/family.

When you said get a job at a store/counter - let's just say Macy's... I can get a job there without a certificate or license? 




 I was also looking at that too - I wanted to be sure that it is the real deal as well. 




 I'm looking for an online school that I can afford to enroll in and receive a certificate/license.  I was wondering if there is one... if so, what would you recommend?? 




 Amazing colors!!  




 Gorgeous! Love the color! 









 Correct me if I'm wrong...

Please tell me if I'm being vague. I will try my best to clarify. I saw the sidebar and NYX was fallen under drugstore HG Master List.  I know they sell it in CVS, Walgreens, Ulta Beauty, etc. but I feel most of their products are excellent in quality and it is affordable. Do you think it could count as mid-range? Why or why not? 




 I would just keep checking back. I usually order at NYX online and believe me, I know the feeling when there's a specific item out of stock and the frustration kicks in.  I also follow them on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It just is easier for me to keep track with them. Hope this helps.
