 Hey folks,
my LoL username is Deathpact Angel, and I am a Gold V midlane main on EUW severs. my favorite champs are Katarina, Zyra, Syndra, Diana and Ahri. I also can play decently with any other role, but each only with a few champions. I play a lot with my bf (a jungle main). If you wanna play with me, just send me a message or add me ingame.  




 Joined in, not too much life there currently on EUW, but I guess that'll change when we get bigger here :)

 Is it even a yordle? He seems pretty big for one, doesn't he...

Also, the monster-thingy that's attacking the village, is it just me or does he look a lot like Vel'Koz? 




 on the left there is the summoner that you get earlier. since you get flash last, flash goes on f.  




 Am I the only one who just gets an "no access" message when opening that link? (and yes, I'm logged in at the site...)
