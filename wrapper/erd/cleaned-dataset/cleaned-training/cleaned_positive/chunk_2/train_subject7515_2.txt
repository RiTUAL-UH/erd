 He's Gregory House. He lied about the not being a mD thing. Everybody lies. 




 Actually kinda helps  




 Maybe once I'm not using all my will trying not to put a fucking knife in my chest, I'll worry about finishing my PhD or working on that six-pack. Thanks, I hadn't considered the fact that not being my normal awful fucking self might require effort. 




 Not in the same way, but yes. Hundreds of medium sized cuts on a small area over months left me with the same feeling. Oddly enough, nerve damage makes tattoos in the area hurt more, for whatever reason

A lot of us have been there I wager. While I can't say going to a hospital or clinic is a bad idea, if you won't, an EMT I spoke with about a similar incident told me to at least use butterfly tape to seal it closed. It will heal without it, but may stay open for a few weeks while it does so, and the scar will be wider if not taped.

Take care Knyburg, and hang in there 




 For doing awfully in school, for not making the most of my opportunities, for being awful and unattractive (and for thinking that while lying in bed instead of working out), for being so angry at myself and so depressing, the list just goes on

I don't know, I've never had anger problems with anyone else. I can be patient for ever with them but me... There's just too much hatred there not to get angry.
