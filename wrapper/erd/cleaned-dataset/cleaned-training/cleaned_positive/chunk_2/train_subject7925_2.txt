 You sound a lot like my brother. He's 20 and he recently asked out a girl for the first time. He got rejected. He's very insecure and the rejection left him saying things like "I'm not meant to be in a relationship" and crap like that. Unless you think getting rejected won't take a shot at your self-esteem, I would "work" on yourself more.
