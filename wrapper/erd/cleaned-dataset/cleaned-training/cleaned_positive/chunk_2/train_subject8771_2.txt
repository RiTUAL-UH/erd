 Reddit, I have noticed more and more that old people just CAN'T DRIVE!! Even my dad is becoming a horrible driver. He drives through stop signs and is generally reckless and my grandma doesn't know how to maintain a steady speed, braking constantly for no reason. What are your stories about old people driving? Do you think they should retake a drivers test?  




 I imagine cat people are a little more introverted and therefore, go on the internet (and post about their cats), whereas dog people are more socially active and go out instead of go on the internet.  




 I don't think her experience would make it less special for you. I had a similar experience with my current boyfriend who had never kissed anyone, but i had. When you're in the moment, those things don't matter that much.  




 A first kiss is very special, especially with someone you care about, but it could turn out awkward if you don't quite know what you're doing. Practice makes perfect.  




 I grew up with a single mom. She was an alcoholic and I am an only child. By the time I was 12, I had learned how to forge her signature, pay bills, do groceries, clean the house, do laundry, wash dishes, make dinner, and be a nurse. Who needs parents anyway...?  




 Society has a serious problem. 




 THIS! On to the Legend of Korra?? 




 I am happy to report that I am still with the person I first had sex with. No regrets

 Wow dude. Sorry, but I cannot muster up any sympathy for you.  




 I think the heart makes it obvious enough 




 She might have been testing you. It was manipulative, but I think she may have wanted to see if she could trust you.  




 Do you know what the music is from? I recognize it, but the name escapes me.  




 I don't get. 




 My mom died when I was 14 years old. She was an alcoholic and prescription drug addict. And I'm sure everyone has heard "Your Mama" jokes. I realized early on that my tragedy was not going to change what people say and that they won't understand what it's like to have a dead mother. All the time people say "Your Mama" jokes and even my friends sometimes forget that my mom died and they will say them to my face. What helps me is to realize that people are stupid and they won't change. When they do say the joke to my face, I wait until they are done and then, with a smile on my face, I remind them that I don't have a mother. Almost every time the person will feel guilty and say sorry and the jokes are over for the day. I don't have a problem with the jokes, I just feel like the honesty will remind them in the future to be more aware of their audience and I think it works. It's worth a try in your case. It's kind of like seeing the funny side and saying something at the same time.

 Well, I can say from experience that the mother probably has had a huge influence in how your daughter feels. I lived with my mom for most of my life. My mom hated my dad too and I grew up thinking I should hate him. I learned later that a lot of things my mom said to me were only half-truths. I don't know the whole story with you, but the mom could have something to do with it and your daughter is a teenager now. You rarely see her, so she can easily use you as a target for her anger. Teens are nasty sometimes.
Is there anyway you could collaborate with your daughter's mother to work something out? It seems like you aren't on good terms with her, but in the interest of your daughter, maybe something can be worked out.  




 This has a resemblance to the island depicted in Harry Potter. 




 ostentatious  




 It does seem rather silly.
