 I havent read the packet yet. I did download it. I was just very cautious and ran like 5 virus checks 




 I actually do think your right. I dont know. /u/afterbang , whats the official play on the field? 




 hmmmm. Yeah, I dont know about Halsey. I love her as a character and of course theres the war crime arguement of "Is she truely guilty or does the ends justify the means?". I personally believe, with you and many others, that its ONI (or more specifically Paragnosky) that has it out for her. The UNSC sanctioned the S2 project to fight the war on Insurrection. It just happened that they were able to also fight the oncoming Covenant war that Halsey knew a little bit about. I dont think she should be treated the way she is during SpOps but now that she's all sorts of pissed at what the UNSC has made her 'babies' into, I can see her working with sects of the Covenant willingly.

As for John, I can see him pulling a "Look at my Service Record and then get back to me if you want to stop me" move and going AWOL to 'revive' Cortana. I mean really, he's had her from the beginning of his MJOLNIR suit days. They have done so much in they're days and she has been the only one who has truly seen how bad some of the shit he gets in is. She has been his only TRUE companion so it's no wonder he will do anything to revive her.

Sorry if this was long but I am just in a typey mood 




 I honestly think AWOL is a legitimate option at this point. I mean really, Master Chief is one of the highest ranking people in the UNSC. Who's gonna stop him? 




 What my Uncle came up with was that its possible he could meet up with Grey Team (Cole Protocol) and they could help him considering they are long distance long term recon 




 One of those questions that will never be answered. I've often wondered myself too. Also, with eating ,and hygiene. Hmmm. 




 Alright. I will give the Win on this one to you and accept I'm wrong. Stupid misinformation in my head 




 Hm. I know before Naomi is given her set of MJOLNIR in Glasslands, she is in an ONI Uniform but shes a S2. I dont know. Maybe its all in my head but I swear that S2's never get rid of their armor. EVER. 




 No, I meant S2. The S4's, when out of armor, can wear normal clothes. 




 Okay not the fact that its a reminder but. I dont know. I figure he'd be so driven and fueled he wouldn't need a constant reminder. 




 I like your idea very much sir. I didn't really bat an eye until
This would explain why he is carrying her chip, as a reminder of what he is fighting for.
And then i just went: "Wooooooooooooah there." 




 Im saying that H5 will be released ~Nov-Dec 2014. We'll get leaks all throughout April-June of next year and maybe a few minor this year. 




 At the end of H4, he does take off his armor and most of the S2's without their armor, keep on their undersuit at the least. 




 My speculation on that:
What MC is holding in his hands is Cortanas AI matrix chip, the thing he constantly pulls out of his helmet back. Deep inside the roots of that chip are the core functions and properties of Cortana. Using this and the possible abilities of the Librarian and other live forerunner species, its very possible he is going to get her restored.

My theory for the librarian: If MC so chooses to go the Librarian route, she will fix Cortana but she will have the same AI life expectancy. She will still have all the memories from before her corruption on the FwUD(So she forgets all that happened during H4). She becomes full again and he starts to turn back to UNSC. **Further offshoot** He comes in contact with Kilo-Five, Grey Team, or Linda and Kelly and works with them to get himself back into the UNSC without high charges.

With a Forerunner: He gets her restored but she's unstable, but permanent. She has the occasional splurge to have John help the Forerunners return to glory but past that she can keep a steady head and maintain her ideas. 









 I have to ask, how is gmod? What does it take to run? I thought about buying after watching a few Pewdiepie videos. Now that I'm hearing about ODST's in it I'm excited. 




 The middle of the Sahara? But if, as everyone assumes, he has gone AWOL or on his own, he would go to Earth. He'd stay away from most of the UNSC superbases. 




 The Librarians hideout was Earth I thought? or was it that she banished the Didact to Earth?
 




 From what I understand its a darker color. Its possible considering the Kilo-Five series. 




 You just went full retard. 




 I would like to apologize for being a no show. My mom (Im only 16) dragged me to this party so I could babysit. So I am very sorry for probably ruining the plans. 




 Sure. Send me a request GT Troop4921 please.I ll be on later on tonight 




 My theory is the following:
1. The robe is to hide his identity from the community just for the ad.
2. He's obviously gone slightly AWOL so also to hide from the UNSC.
3. If he's gone AWOL and since Cortana is dead, his suit cant be readily fixed and repaired. 




 Thank you! Makes me smile everytime.

 Ill be more than happy to do it today
GT:Troop4921 




 If I get a virus from this I swear to god...
 




 Im not the best either but ill 1v1 you a bit
 









 Yeah,its called a phone
 




 Thank you. I will now scour these for a good story i can send her
 




 Yeahhh, her and I both have sex drives that are just out of wack. Hers is ALWAYS through the roof and mine is just high. Again why I said I may catch some flack is cause of my age. And I understand what your saying in the first paragraph. 




 So I am just going to hope this belongs here and alot of you might raise hell against me but here goes. I (m16) have had this girl(also 16) thats been my FWB for at least a year and a half now. We always make deals to where we even out who owes who what blah blah blah. Well recently it came to me oweing her a story of her liking. Well, she isn't dominant but she likes bondage-ish stuff. I'm not into that but I am keeping my promise. She likes rough, throwing around, tied up, and her not recieving much pleasure but being teased with what she does get.
Again, not my style. So if any of you guys know some good stories I could send her in place of my (very poorly written) story please link it to me and I would be more than grateful. Also, ideas for when we do mess around in the future.

EDIT: We're not physical FWB. If you saw me, youd understand why. We skype and phonesext alot. 




 Hey Ill be on here in a minute Troop4921 is my GT and im working on Dominion master commendation 




 thanks. would also help if my game didnt crash every 5 seconds lol. really cant wait till my birthday so i can offload alot of this crap on my laptop (i.e. games and photos). I will talk to all three of you the moment I get membership and ill be ready to kick ass and take names in game 




 Hey guys, I'm considering getting a RS membership again. If I did decide to become member again, would anyone want to quest and such with me so I could get back into the swing of it all?

 I could help possibly
 




 You still on?
 




 I kinda want to start playing again(On the 2007 servers though) but idk about membership. While I love the game, on my laptop its just hard to run. When my birthday rolls around here in a month im getting an External Hard Drive that I can offload all my games(Skyrim, FNV, Fallout 1,2,BoS, Amnesia, MariO, and Surgeon Simulator) onto so that I have more open memory and my RAM increases to run RS faster. 




 So I've been playing RS since ~2006 and I kinda cut off two years ago. I got rid of membership and still have ALOT of membership items and idk if theres a specific place I'm supposed to put this but I'm willing to sell almost all of it. Pretty well over its just a bunch of gear, some farming stuff and other misc. items I haven't and probably never will use. Get ahold of me on here and Ill trade with you in game:)
 




 I dont know if its good for scrip but Rampage: Minigun Mayhem, if you get gold or past, its pretty good loot/xp/scrip 




 Okay so I would love new races (ie. Castithian, Endogene, the race that Torc is) and an extension of what happened to the Stratocarrier. Like better explanation. I understand just even more story to it would be nice. Agreed with top comment of multiple breakdown/buy. New-ish vehicles or more customizable vehicles. More variety in enemies. DEFINITELY A GRAND EXCHANGE/MARKET. Anyone else have some variation on my ideas?
Oh, and one of the things a couple of friends of mine came up with; like an addon pack of nerdy armors such as ones that look like Samus' armor from Metroid, Isaac Clarke's armor from Dead Space, Master Chief's armor from Halo, Storm Trooper from Star Wars, and other generally nerdy gaming armors. 




 I don't use medic primarily but I do have my "Plague-healer" class which I have a BMG primary and Infector secondary with an infector grenade. It comes in handy, really, only on co-op maps and minor arkfalls. The group I play with often has at least one of us on the healer role and I'm normally stuck in that role. My standard though is an assault class however. It just depends on the person I guess. 




 lol i get it now
