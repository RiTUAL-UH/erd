 I'm pretty sure they'd take you anyways, you'd just be in debt afterwards :P 




 My kitten does that too! I haven't got a clue why, though. 




 Something like this triggered my fear of deep/dark water. I was 11 on a vacation with family in Florida, we rented a boat to go snorkeling. I swam maybe 50 feet from the boat, when I felt something stinging. I looked down and there was jellyfish all around me. I completely freaked out, and almost drowned. Still have nightmares about it. 




 I do the exact same things! But I eat my boogers because I enjoy it. It's nice too, because I rarely get sick.  




 No white after Labor Day. 




 Thanks for the reply! This was very useful, I looked it up and she does seem to have many of the symptoms associated with this.  




 Thanks for the advice! I'll definitely try cleaning out her nasal passages, just to see if it makes things a little easier for her. I don't think the kibble was too large, as she has no trouble eating pieces of meat bigger than the dry food. As soon as I have extra money I am planning to take her to the Vet, but until then I'm trying to take care of her as good as I can :)
