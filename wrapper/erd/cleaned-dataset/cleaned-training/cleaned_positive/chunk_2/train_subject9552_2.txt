 The best thing to do is foster in them some love for a subject. If they love it, they'll pursue it. You can help by making that love stronger as they grow up. I would suggest introducing them to science and technology, by introducing them to fun science videos on Youtube (ASAPscience, It's Okay To Be Smart, VSauce, etc.) - my 9 year old nephew is hooked on them. Send them lego model sets of spacecrafts, tell their parents to take them to science museums, tell them on the phone about cool things that are happening in science in layman's terms... they really get a kid interested. 




 I wouldn't. I'd kill myself. A world war with the technology we have will most likely annihilate the human race - international biological warfare and nuclear warfare is enough to quickly weaken and destroy entire nations. During the war, all the knowledge we've come to know will be lost, and all scientific discovery will be geared towards the war effort. I don't see the point in living through it. Then again, some people might just survive in the aftermath - but it will take centuries to recover to present day conditions once more.
