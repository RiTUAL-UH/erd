 considering that I've been called a satanist many times before because of these particular things, I would have to say hair/makeup/clothing and many of my drawings.  




 I have had a Galaxy S3 for a while now and I really love it. It has a great battery life, its pretty durable even with a cheap case, its a little more complex than Apple, and it has a lot of customizable features. Meanwhile, all of my friends have iPhones and all of them are the same. Battery doesnt last any longer than about noon, expensive case yet still manage to shatter the screen, constantly complaining about their phones, but still every day I hear "why dont you just get and iPhone? they are way better than Android". I am not saying that all iPhone users are like this (my friends are just stereotypical teenage white girls) and I am not saying that iPhones are horrible. I'm just saying that I prefer Android.  




 oh, okay. and yeah its really interesting to see other people's thoughts on stuff like this because when I've asked people about this, I have gotten responses anywhere from "ghosts are 100% real and you cant tell me otherwise" to "you need to get mental help"  




 I personally believe in ghosts but thats because i have been around spirits my entire life and have done a little bit of paranormal investigation in my free time. I will admit though that there really is no scientific evidence to prove that they exist even with all the EVPs and unexplained photos and videos. So you can take it either way. There may be a logical explanation to this but whether or not you find one is up to you. I hope this makes sense even though it probably doesnt help your situation much.
