 Thanks, that's what I think would be best. As much as I eventually want to get back to working full time and feeling like I'm a proper member of society again, I think wading into it is my best bet. The last thing I want is to overwhelm myself and break down again. I guess part of my anxiety is based on the pressure I've felt from everyone to "just get a job already" and the guilt I feel for being so dependent at my age, but I really do need to ee acclimate myself and do what's best for me. Thanks so much for the advice. It's nice to hear from other people who have managed to get back up on their feet. 




 Thanks I was planning on asking in jobs and getemployed but I figured I'd reach out here first since I kind of just needed to get all this off my chest and knew that I'd need to extremely abbreviate this there. Thanks for the advice though, that's going to be my next step :)
