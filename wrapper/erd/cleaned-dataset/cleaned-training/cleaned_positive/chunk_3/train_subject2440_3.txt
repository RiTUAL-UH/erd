 There was a specific judge who envisioned the power of electronic communication in the future (today) and ruled to break up ma bell (AT T). Also huge was the TeleCommunication Act of 1996 (where Bill Clinton and Congress gave media corporations the digital spectrum free of charge).

You should look for docs on Comm history or Comm law. I remember seeing one or two of them in college. They were PBS or 60 minutes or something maybe.

Edit: email any media professor and you'll get a list. 




 Most unfortunate on so many levels.
