 I'm pretty sure that can make you really sick. 




 “Three of the four elements are shared by all creatures, but fire was a gift to humans alone. Smoking cigarettes is as intimate as we can become with fire without immediate excruciation. Every smoker is an embodiment of Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and bringing it on back home. We smoke to capture the power of the sun, to pacify Hell, to identify with the primordial spark, to feed on them arrow of the volcano. It's not the tobacco we're after but the fire. When we smoke, we are performing a version of the fire dance, a ritual as ancient as lightning.”

-Tom Robbins, *Still Life with Woodpecker* 




 Ooh thanks for the explanation. English is my only language and I still didn't get it. Maybe I'm just being slow today. 




 I was a 17 year old girl at one point in my life. What the top commenters are saying about trying to talk to her about it without being too harsh or threatening to punish sounds like it would be the most effective. I'm sure most of us can remember a time when we were in our late teens and our parents trying to punish us was more of a joke than anything else. At 17, she's nearly an adult, and while she will obviously still be under your rules at home, she will see herself as and want to be treated as an adult. You also sound like you understand that concept of letting her form into her own person as well and I commend you for that. Remind her that she could end up in serious trouble if she's doing illegal things. It sounds like she's a smart kid with good schooling and possibly college aspirations so a firm reminder about not messing that up could potentially go a long way. 




 I'm here after reading this on the front page, and I have to completely agree with you. I am a hardcore grilled cheese lover, and can't stand it when people put other things on the sandwich. 




 Sean Connery vs The Cock? I'd watch that.

Greatest thing I've read all day.

 I decided to take Java in high school to satisfy the my fourth math class needed for my advanced diploma. Figured it would just be a BS class I'd get through and never think about again. Ended up going to college for computer science and now I'm a web developer. 









 Wait what happens if you plant a perfect apple? Do you get a perfect apple tree? 




 Don't eat it. It's poisonous. 




 Best comparison ever. 




 I like your idea here. Even if it looked like a continuity error, or simply was an error, I think the possible subtle meaning here is really cool. 




 Trying not to cry at my desk right now. Failing. 




 Can we please talk about why there are children in a fire pit? 




 After being taken care of by humans, are they more friendly toward people as a result? Does anyone have any in a personal bat house or anything, like pets? 




 Bats fixed for frying... Pretty messed up children's book... I like it. 




 I want a pet bat so bad. Seeing this makes me want one even more. They are so adorable! 




 She types like she's so super excited about everything!!! (With all those exclamation marks... !!!) 









 Sexual desire is a weird thing for most of us it seems. And while it's true I probably don't find humor in the same things that you do, I still have a good sense of it. 




 clan #29V98CRV

Brand new clan, trying to get it up and running so we can war.

War frequency 2x /week once we have enough members.

Earn elder and co by donating.

Don't rush your town hall.

Let us know you're from reddit if you join. 




 I started like three weeks ago and have gotten pretty far. They do a good job of making sure the new players don't get drowned out by the people who have been playing for a while. 




 I did it too. My clanmates were all "what's that red thing on your th?" Support (Product)^RED ! 




 It was one of those "since you're here..." and admittedly I didn't feel like going all the way home, and extra hours and shit. 




 "Hey do you want to grab a drink sometime?" I don't understand the whole dropping hints and waiting for him to figure it out mindset. Men are mostly stupid on the subject of woman hints. If you're interested in a guy, go get him. 




 I once walked into work, clocked in, sat down at my desk, and my manager came up and said "why are you here? You're off today." Long story short, I ended up working a full shift. 




 Very upset that there are so many Imperials. Praise Talos! 




 Um... Portal Long Fall Boots anyone? 




 The length of this is almost perfect for my lung capacity. Just starts to feel too full right at the end. 




 I'm a smoker. I can do it. Walking up steep hills, on the other hand... 




 Principal was probably in on it.

Also, your code is spilling into your English... 




 Kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species. For some reason I will never ever forget that. 




 You mean to tell me that I'm not looking at a picture of a panda? I don't believe you OP. 




 This. This is fucking great. 




 You're not the only one. My mom didn't talk about it at all, so when certain puberty things happened that I should have made her aware of, I hid it because I thought it was weird and reason for judgement. 




 I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but what is bv? ^I ^feel ^like ^I ^should ^know ^this... 




 I'm still blown away by the fact that people gave her money after she left her kids in the car. Seriously, what the fuck? 




 How are you people seeing these things?? Legit staring at the thumbnail now trying to figure this out. 




 I'm not sure how I feel about this. 




 Well, time to go order a few things from Amazon. 




 Happened to me. Am woman. Can confirm.

Dated a guy once for about two months who told me he had a propensity for sticking his dick in crazy, and I was thinking, "ok, well I'm relatively normal, so it should be good." Nope. He turned out to be the most arrogant, self-centered person I'd ever met and it was simply impossible to please him. Any opinion or idea that differed from his was considered "crazy". Dropped that like a hot potato. Ended with me telling him "maybe you're the problem." 




 Guys! We've come so far for equality! Why you gotta start fighting about it now? 




 Can you please elaborate on this so I can decide if it's worth it to put you back in your place? 




 Hold on. 3 sexual partners? I know this has been beaten into the ground ITT already, but damn. Seeing this must have transformed me into a basic bitch because I can no longer even. 




  he isn't adopted

That you know of... Unless you're the mother, and then there's a higher probability of you being sure it's yours. 




 How does that have any relevance? 




 My first question for you, after looking at your website, is: how are you different than sites like Trello or Basecamp? There are tons of collaboration tools out there. I would highlight what makes yours different/better than the rest, or what makes it better for your target audience. I think the customer inclusion is probably a big thing. Also, the x leads to y, y leads to z thing you have going on in the pitch lost me a little. 




 What was your previous programming experience like, before developing this (languages, etc)? You say you are a software dev, but had you worked with mobile dev before this? 




 I'm a tummy sleeper too. My chiropractor tells me it's bad for your spine and neck. I can't fall asleep any other way though. 




 I don't think that's a note. That looks like a message for the bathtub. One of those info plaques that hotels like to put everywhere because normal people don't know how water works. 




 They... threw them away? That hurts. 




 It's a bell curve, and the peak is at that mohawk. 




 I was taught to let hydrogen peroxide sit in your ears until the fizzing stops and then let it drain out. Not sure if it does anything, but my parents used to make me do it when I was a kid. 




 I once lost points on a writing assignment because I wrote "per cent" instead of "percent". Questioned teacher, because family is British, teacher says "because America (paraphrased)." 




 I sometimes press the button as I'm walking past it, and then continue down the street without crossing. And the ones here are the ones that talk, so it yells "WAIT" every time you press the button. 




 Netflix will always be there for me. 




 Next time I flirt I'm just going to lead with this. It may have worked... 




 I can't decide if this is referring to his appearance or his communication skills... 




 /r/punchablefaces  




 Definitely right there with you. Does that make us old? 




 Know where we can buy prints from? I want some of these. 




 Just got the email about it. Can't wait to get mine! Says 14 days after it goes to print on the 15th though :( 




 Until the 15th I believe. 




 Must be a pretty shitty patent. 




 Ooh that sounds like fun! Also, cold.

 My roommate was in charge of the internet last year. We got a letter from (I think) Comcast that listed a few titles of movies we'd torrented and told us they'd kill our internet service if we didn't stop. 




 I'm not an organ donor. Honestly, I find it very weird to think that I even have organs, and I definitely don't want them removed from my body and given to someone else. 




 Sounds like I'm moving to England. The US continually makes me angry and it's only getting worse. 




 As a climber, this picture is terrifying. 




 Will we still get the gear if they don't make the goal? I really want that hoodie!! 




 Hello and welcome to reddit. 




 Be careful. If you punch her, you might get some feminism on your hand and that shit sticks worse than glue.
