 I didn't until I got pregnant. But it was so minor I didn't notice it. Just went into the ER for heart rate not going down and they found it.  




 Going the other way as someone currently pregnant: stillbirth.  




 Same here. I'm on modified bed rest for hypertension and I'm supposed to take it easy. Doctor said no sex would be best route, and my husband misses the sex and intimacy so much. I got him a flesh light as sort of an "I'm sorry" and improvise using that.  




 I'm 3/4 of the way done with a crochet baby blanket :) just took time off from it this weekend which was a mistake. I'll crochet for 6 hours one day then won't crochet again for 3 days due to being burned out on it. 




 Bed rest is exhausting. I think I'm getting depressed. Going to make a quick trip to Michael's today to get crafty stuff to distract me (thank god for modified bed rest).  

Sleep has gotten worse. Waking up every 90 minutes except from 4-8 where I actually get sleep.  




 Ugh yesss. A friend of mine from high school has gone super granola with her baby, talking about essential oils and posting articles shaming those who don't breastfeed, including one similar to the one you talk about.  I wanted to point out that her 17 month old has missed almost every developmental milestone to date. But I keep my mouth shut. I wasn't breastfed either.  




 A few years ago my 30 year old sister asked me what a dildo is after we went to go see a performance of Rent.  




 Yeah there's no solid proof that nipple confusion even exists.  




 No, it's a completely separate load since they have feces and urine on them. Some people wash them in hot water which you can't do for normal laundry.   




 As does the laundering of cloth diapers. Carbon dioxide output is roughly the same.  




 While I agree with you on every other point, the environmental impact has been widely debated.  So from a frugality point, yes cloth are more cost effective.  But environmentally the jury is still out when you take into account the laundering of the diapers.  Most say they have the same effect on the environment:

Keeping a child clad in home-laundered cloth diapers for 2.5 years emitted 1,232 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent, vs. 1,380 pounds for disposable diapers.

 That's borderline. Since your BP went down I would just take it easy. I had a positive dipstick pee test and BP of 140/90. Sent to hospital and all the labs (blood and urine) came back normal. Doctor out me on bedrest for pregnancy hypertension. 

Just take it easy. Elevate your feet. Be off your feet as much as possible. And good luck from a fellow Houstonian :) 




 Same with my husband. Getting him out of bed is pretty frustrating.  




 Bought my baby shower dress today.  I also, at 35 weeks, bought my first pairs of maternity yoga pants.  Why did I not buy these sooner!? 




 Congrats! I also have PCOS and was on a LOT of progesterone my first trimester. Here I am at 34 weeks. Just keep trucking, this community is awesome :) 




 34 weeks here too. Pissing makes me mad because it feels like I have to go so bad but only a trickle comes out.  




 Normal unless accompanied by bleeding! Your uterus is growing, no need to worry :) 




 You're in the best place you can be! Medical professionals can help with whatever is going on, they are highly educated and are prepared for whatever happens. Just breathe deep, and try to reassure yourself they are going to do everything they can to help you and little one. Worrying will not change the outcome and the stress of worrying isn't good for you or baby.  




 At the interview for my current position I was asked this in a two part question: "How much do you currently make and what are you looking to make here?"  My answer:  "I will not answer the first part of that question, but my salary requirement is $X"

Got the job. 




 Aww my cat has been doing this to me lately too. 




 Where are you from and what are you expecting? Good food? Drunken night of debauchery? Line dancing? Houston has tons of things to give for any kind of good time wanted but we need a few more details.  




 I'll keep you in my prayers. I have medical related anxiety too, getting my gallbladder out was hell. But you have to remember that your panic is doing nothing to change the future situation. Just breathe deep and if you find yourself panicking, just think "I'm fine, I will be fine".  Try distracting yourself with a smartphone game or something while you're waiting.  




 There's a guy who has been filming his "prank" of putting his hands on random girls' asses in public. Sexual harassment disguised as an asshole pulling a prank. Disgusting.  




 Underoath 




 Negotiating my current salary when I was in the interview process.  I don't have a prestigious job or anything, but probably make more than 90% of others in my field. 




 No more pregnancy brain.  Not much to really think about on bed rest.

Great news, this week my BP has been right around 115/83 every day! Looks like bed rest is working for the hypertension :) 




 That's my snack too! Had one at 3:30 this morning.  




 Similarly, anxiety. I was always a worry wart but never classified myself as having anxiety until I started having chronic panic attacks out of nowhere where I was convinced I was dying 3-7 times a week or more.  




 This describes on of my friends to a T.  She has 90k in student loans, is constantly getting collection calls and ignores them.  She makes a decent wage, but had to live in the trendy part of town instead of living with her parents rent free.  She goes out 3-5 nights a week ("happy hour, it's cheaper!") and is a brand whore.  Always has her YSL bracelet on, tags her instagram pictures with #armani or whatever brand she is wearing.  

Poor girl tries to talk about eventually buying a house in the next few years, but I'd be willing to bet everything I own that her credit is in the shitter. 




 I have suffered from anxiety and depression for the last 4 year or so.  I tried to get off my antidepressants, but I was so stressed that it was having a negative effect on my health.  

One thing my psychiatrist says can really help avoid PPD is getting 6 hours of sleep a night after baby arrives.  Obviously this may not be possible for everyone, but if you can, have your SO or someone be on baby duty for as long as possible per day.  

Also, anti-depressants are not the end of the world.  I'm on Prozac now at 34 weeks and will be on it after I give birth, too.  If I can't BF on it, my mental well being is much more important for baby than breast milk.   




 One newborn outfit with a onesie, hoodie, and pants (because Oct/Nov in Houston the weather can be anything), a couple of 0-3 onesies in case he's a biggun, and a couple of extra NB onesies and a blanket. 




 Only on a once-in-a-while basis according to my doctor.  She says it does the same as a benzo if you use it sparingly.   




 Every damn time.  "I really hope this isn't the baby I'm pushing out" even though I know it's mostly an irrational thought. 




 Yup.  Engineering major? Apply to jobs in Houston, you'll get a job.  I don't know one person with an Engineering degree who didn't have a job 2 months out of college (at the very latest)

 




 No swelling.  But by the feel of the pain I was surprised to look down and see no swelling at all.  It feels like pressure.  But I've noticed throughout today while crocheting and sitting around that I get it in both feet, and my hands occasionally.  I think it's just poor circulation probably due to the positions I sit in. 




 Yup.  My smell changed with the onslaught of increased discharge.  I lovingly call it "swamp crotch" 




 Relaxing... Yeah I figure if it gets to the point where I can't stop thinking about it I'll call my insurance's nurse's line.  Thank you so much :) 




 You're right.  It's mostly gone and when it's here it's only noticeable for a few minutes, not even enough though to be a hindrance to my walking or anything.   




 Recently I was diagnosed with pregnancy hypertension.  My BP is fine now that I'm on modified bed rest, but ever since that happened I'm hyper aware of every ache and pain.  I'm sitting more than I'm up but I still might be up for a while each day to make sure I'm moving.

Yesterday for about 5 minutes I had a weird, not-severe pain in my left foot.  No swelling, but it felt like it was a swelling pain.  Pressure pain, tight, squeezing.  I've heard about DVT and one foot swelling.  I was told that because I'm on modified bed rest I shouldn't experience any swelling.  

The pain has only happened again once since yesterday, for less time and less severe.  I'm just concerned I'm asking my OB too many questions about stuff, like every minor ache and pain.

Should I call a nurse's line instead?  Should I just wait and see if the pain gets to be more severe?  My OB practice is one doctor and one nurse, very small, and pretty busy.   They're actually not even open today due to a birth.   




 May your pregnancy be completely boring and easy!  




 Yup, my brain is basically Gir.  I miss that show.  Maybe I should do another watch through since I have 6 more weeks of this. Â 

 




 Not to mention if you have them at an earlier (yet responsible) time, they're out sooner.  My first (and only) will be here in a month or so and he'll be in college (hopefully) by the time I'm 45.  Sounds pretty good to me. 




 Mine was taken away at 3 weeks due to mom's milk being dried up.  Our cat is... special.  Nothing too bad, but constantly kneading a blanket we have, occasional yowling in the middle of the night. 




 We are entirely split because we disagree about rules interpretations.

Sounds like Christianity.  Denominations of mods. 




 Congrats and welcome!   I also have GAD, though haven't had the NICU experience.   




 34 weeks pregnant, on bed rest for hypertension, and our bank account is frozen due to fraud warning.  A new delicious taco place opened a mile from us and I'm stuck in here watching Netflix forever. 




 I wish foil worked for ours. They just lay down on top of it. But we got a bassinet that vibrates, and that freaks them out. So any time they jump in I just hit the button.  




 A baby.  Currently 34 weeks pregnant. 




 Currently pregnant (34 weeks) and on low dose Prozac.  I had been weaned off Celexa by the 3rd month of my pregnancy, but my panic attacks came back very strongly so I was put on low dose Prozac to help.  I'm not concerned, though.  Stress on my body with constant panic isn't good for baby, and my doctors ultimately decided that the slight risk was ok.  Plus this study doesn't seem to be very reliable anyways. 




 It's spinal fluid equalizing. Perfectly normal. 




 It's spinal fluid equalizing.  Perfectly normal. 




 Laganja was the one person I was thinking when she was explaining Poor Me. Poor Laganja.  




 They will either bring in lunch or release you to get your own lunch.  




 July 17th. She came back into town for the Lady Gaga concert. She will be back October 4th. I don't have many friends and the only one I consider a close friend moved away in March. 




 Thank you. So many people in this thread saying how dangerous a loaded gun is and how it's a deal breaker simply bc it's loaded. A home intruder isn't going to wait for you to load your gun. If the weapon is for home defense it should be loaded. 




 A home intruder won't wait for you to load your gun. If the firearm is for home protection, it should be loaded with the safety on.  




 He's so cute! And you are super mama for that graduation story! Way to go! 




 Chips   queso

Apple pie

I just want to live off these things  




 I've never had a clot or period blood come out in the shower. I guess I'm weird.  




 It was ok!  135/85.  Not great, but I was nervous walking into Kroger to get it checked and power-walked in there :) 




 Since it's a seminar, there are usually breaks.  You won't be the only one who is there alone, people may try to talk to you.  Just make small talk, maybe you'll find someone who shares an interest in things you like.  There will be a break for lunch.

I **highly** doubt they will call each of you by name.  You may need to wear a name tag.  They just need your information to confirm attendance.  

They will probably have different speakers to speak about different sub-topics of the seminar.  There may be 90 minute sessions with small breaks in between.  Usually questions should be saved for the end of each session if the floor is opened for questions.

Your anxiety will do nothing to make the experience better.  It'll do the opposite.  If you find yourself getting anxious, just take deep breaths through it for as long as it takes for you to settle down. 




 Thanks!  I'll be going in about 15 minutes to check.  I'm feeling a lot better after a good night's sleep though.  I'll edit to update :) 




 How exciting! Good luck, mama! Take it easy until then :) 




 33+6 today. Still on modified bed rest for blood pressure. Broke my bed rest yesterday due to restlessness and I definitely shouldn't have. Doctor's appointment Monday and I have a feeling I'll be sent back to the hospital for another NST if not more. May drop by CVS at 8am to test blood pressure due to headaches.  If it's too bad I'll have to go to L D :(

EDIT: BP was 135/85 and that was with me being nervous as shit!  Gonna continue bed rest. 




 Awful.  




 They recently opened a DD about a mile from me. To me their donuts taste like satan's anus compared to Shipley's.  




 It's a shame Shipley's isn't a nationwide chain.  Krispy Kreme is okay, but any other donut has been tainted because a Shipley's donut is so delicious. 




 As a fellow nervous nellie who is far along in pregnancy:

STOP.  Stop taking your temperature.  Don't google every little symptom you have.  If you feel like something really isn't right, call your OB.  Otherwise you're most likely fine.  Worrying about it won't do anything to make it better, and your body needs to be as stress free as possible.  Just relax, it's going to be one hell of a ride from here on out :)

If you are getting nervous and ever need someone to talk to, PM me. 




 The only reason I can see these rules being there is to protect the technician.  I'm sure the technician can recognize things, but they can't officially give you any information that might lead you to a diagnosis since they are not a nurse or a doctor.  They are simply there to take pictures.  

I've honestly only had one ultrasound done by an actual technician with no doctor in the room, and that was before I was even pregnant, to diagnose gallstones.   




 Pappsitos fajitas are like crack. 




 Sons of Anarchy. Just finished House last week.  




 Similarly, PCOS. Women with PCOS usually have very irregular periods, sometimes going months without them.  




 Not cooking much due to bed rest. New taco place opened up nearby that I am so excited about. Will probably have husband go pick some up for me with chips and queso for lunch.  




 I'm on bed rest for pregnancy. I've crocheted for 2 hours today and binge watched Sons of Anarchy. All I want is wine and sushi.  I ordered delivery sushi (cooked) but for some reason the credit card didn't go through despite it working everywhere else. All I wanted was a shaggy dog roll. So I made a pb j and am now just counting down the time until I can go to sleep.  




 Today's my birthday. I had an appointment with my OB where my urine showed +1 for protein and BP was 140/75. Went to L D triage to be monitored. Everything showed perfect, lab results were perfect. 

Doctor decided to put me on modified bed rest anyways. So now I'm off work until I recover from delivery.  No exercising, no working, no heavy cleaning at home.  I can stand up, walk around and do stuff. 

This sucks. I'm such an antsy person. I can't stand being home for very long. I have stuff I can learn and work on while I'm at home, it just sucks. Thankfully there isn't a financial burden. And my husband works from home so I have company and help nesting. 

Guess I'll learn some VBA, crochet, work on the baby book, plan meals for my husband to cook, and feel my baby move a lot. 

Anyone else on bedrest? How do you stay sane??? 









 For the last 3 weeks or so my outer ladybits have felt really sore. I'm currently 32 weeks, and it seems to happen mostly when I'm getting up or walking around.  It's like they've been bruised or something. Ultrasound confirmed last week that baby is now head down (was breech before), so I figure that may be a part of it. But my cervix and inner lady parts don't hurt. 

Anyone else feeling this? 




 The gist of it is this: husband notices I am snoring a lot in first trimester. Noticed one bout of apnea. Snoring continued into second trimester. I went to sleep doctor, did a home sleep test, results inconclusive and they didn't push my insurance to do a lab sleep test. Then the sleep tech at that sleep lab got really creepy, started sending me my results, pics of his son, and other creepy stuff. I reported him and made an appointment with a new doctor. 

I'm not gonna dance around it. I'm obese. But for the last month or so my snoring has completely gone away. No bouts of apnea that my husband has noticed. I have so much more energy lately, and all my leg movements during sleep are virtually gone. 

The new doctor got authorization for an in-lab sleep test, and the lab is super nice. But my anxiety has been up lately and I'm a little terrified to be away from my husband, hooked up to a ton of machines. 

What would you do if you were in my position? Go through with it? Or just cancel it since a majority of the symptoms are now gone? 




 So I went to the ER earlier this week for dehydration.  I have been drinking at least 3.5L of water per day, monitoring my urine to make sure it's light yellow.  But therein lies the problem.

My pee is either dark yellow or almost crystal clear.  My nurse yesterday at my OB even kept remarking about how my pee was almost clear.  I can't seem to get to that proper light yellow color that I keep hearing about.  I've been drinking one Powerade Zero daily (or using a nuun tablet) to get my electrolytes.  No swelling.

Is urine that's almost clear ok? 




 I was having such great success on Celexa, but due to baby being dependent and it messing up my chances of breastfeeding, I weaned off of it.  Everything was going really well for 2 months, but this last week has been hell.

I'm terrified of dying during childbirth.  I've looked up statistics and am just convinced I'm going to draw the short straw.  I'm already 28 weeks along, so I'm going to have to birth this baby no matter what.  It really doesn't help that my husband has the same fear, it just affects his life less than mine does.  He knows someone who almost died during childbirth so that is what drives his fear.

I'm giving birth at a branch of one of the top hospitals in the country.  The city I live in has the best medical center in the world.   Yet here I am, still panicking.

Any moms out there?  Can you help me out?  I'm going back to my therapist in a couple of weeks, but I need temporary sanity. 




 I had been suffering for months, basically since I got pregnant.  I tried everything but nothing really helped me get back to normal until I gave in to my very granola friend:

If you're consistently constipated, try **kefir**, seriously.  It tastes like ass but I swear I was backed up 2 days ago and now my body is like "oh yeah, let's do this!"

I got the kid's kind because I'm not a fan of fermented things.  One tiny bottle of it 2 days ago and my body is happy again.  It's like birds are singing.  I can get it at most grocery stores in my area.  Whole Foods has the most variety. 

What other remedies do you ladies have? 




 21 weeks today and I can honestly say I've never been this exhausted in my life.  I work a desk job and have a hard time keeping my eyes open.  I slept 15 hours yesterday and 12 the day before.  

Could this be a sign of GD?  I get exceptionally tired after I have any carbs, which I'm very aware of from doing keto before getting pregnant.  I have had insulin resistance for the last 8 years.

I drink diet cokes for the caffeine, but they don't do much.  Coffee makes me jittery and anxious so I tend to stay away from it.  I did just finish weaning off my Celexa, maybe that has a hand in all of this.

On top of everything I ruined 90% of my maternity wardrobe from leaving a tube of lipstick in my jeans and then drying them with my maternity tops.  I just want to run home screaming and crawl into bed for the next 19 weeks.

HELP.

Edit: OK I'm so thankful to see it's not just me.  For those future mamas who work on your feet, you deserve a parade. I can barely make it through the day just sitting at my desk. 









 I'm 18 weeks pregnant and because of my growing uterus underneath, my stomach is being pushed out.  I was about 213 before getting pregnant, and I've never had a belly, it's usually flatter (my weight carried in my butt, legs, and thighs).  Now that my baby bump is being pushed out, it just looks like I have a beer belly and it jiggles when I walk :(  

Does this ever firm up or will my belly jiggle all throughout pregnancy? 




 Anyone else experience very light sleeping?  My baby isn't waking me up, nor is my bladder. I just can't sleep more than 45 minutes at a time. 

I thought it was my husband's snoring that was waking me up but it happens no matter where I sleep. 

I get some relief with Benadryl but I would rather not take it every night. Any suggestions? 




 BOY!!! All the old wives tales pointed to boy. Husband is so happy, he's a little afraid of girls. 

Baby boy was NOT cooperating at the ultrasound. Took orange juice and rolling around and poking him with the wand to get him to move the umbilical cord to give us a peek. 

So happy!!!

 Dreamt about donuts last night.  Went to Shipley's as soon as I was awake and they were open (at 6:45) and got a huge cinnamon twist, 12 donut holes, and a sausage   cheese kolache.  Was it worth it? I'll say yes now before the sugar crash happens and I'm back asleep at 8:30. 

 




 So I was seeing a reproductive endocrinologist until 11 weeks who did ultrasounds every week.  I was then transferred to the OB of my choice, and I admit I didn't do a lot of research.  My current OB is well-established, has a lot of experience, but no ultrasounds in-office and doesn't send me off for another ultrasound until I'm 20 weeks.

I want to find out more information about my fetus before then.  Should I change to another OB?  The only issue I've had so far with my pregnancy is low progesterone which was monitored and treated until 11 weeks. 




 I'm 13+3 today. Woke up this morning with a little bump and some pain underneath the bump. I've been sleeping on my back. Is it time to start sleeping on my side, or is this pain unavoidable?

Also, when did you buy your pregnancy pillows?  




 Most people here in the first trimester say they're not "out of the water just yet" in regards to their pregnancy. 

Is there a time where you go "whew... This is really happening?" I figure mine will be 24 weeks, viability day. Is there a time before then that you feel the enormous worry weight lifted off your shoulders?

I'm 13 weeks today. I feel the worry lessening as time goes by but I don't think it will completely disappear until I hear that baby cry for the first time  




 Back story:  Husband and I make decent money, enough to handle a car note.  So I decided last July to trade in my 2003 Corolla and buy a brand new 2013 Prius C for $25k when I still have $30k in student loans to pay off.  

Come February and... surprise! I'm pregnant.  My husband and I want to pay off our debt and buy a house.  I figure one of the quicker ways to do this is to trade in my car and get something older.  

Still owe $21k on the car, trade in value research shows anywhere from 14k - 19k.  I financed through the dealer who then sold my loan to Fifth Third Bank, which doesn't operate in Texas (where I am).

I have no idea what I'm doing.  I don't even know if it's worth it to trade in for an $8-10k car just to still have to pay on my original car loan.   


Edit: thanks for your input! I will be keeping the car, especially since the fuel savings partly make up for the car note. The payment isn't destroying us at all, we still make enough to build up an emergency fund and pay off our debt faster than paying the minimum.  




 HELP!!!

I have PCOS with insulin resistance.  Before getting pregnant I was doing the keto diet, but now I can't keep anything down but carbs.  I'm bloating like crazy, already gained 12-15 pounds (depending on the day).  My GP and OB are both telling me to take it easy with the carbs, but I can't keep anything else down.  Eating mainly protein and fats make me really queasy and I eventually throw up everything.  I've been surviving on cereal, sandwiches, fruit, and crackers but I can't stop gaining weight.  

I'm well aware I'm probably eating too many calories, but with the IR carbs make me hungry....

Anyone have any suggestions?  I've tried nuts, eggs, salads, etc...  I just can't seem to stop eating, and it's all carbs. 




 I've been seeing an RE since I found out I was pregnant.  At around 6 weeks my progesterone levels were 10-13 so I was put on supplementation just to make sure.  Since then, everything has looked great.  Ultrasounds look textbook, HCG rising perfectly, Estradiol in the right levels.

I was taken off my progesterone supplements last week at 10 weeks (when my levels were 26).  I was told the placenta should start taking over the production.

Went back in yesterday (at 11+3) and my levels were at a 10.1.  I'm terrified.  What if my placenta doesn't take over production enough?

And what's worse is I'm now in a phase where I'm not being overseen by any doctor.  Yesterday was my last day with the RE and I don't see my OB until Tuesday.  So I guess I'll be freaking out until Tuesday.

Any words of advice/encouragement?  I know that 10.1 is technically in the OK range for first trimester, but with the second trimester so close I'm worried I won't be up to 20 by then.  




 I just need to get this off my chest because I can't stop crying.

I almost hit a family today with my car, pregnant mother included.  I was waiting to back out, letting cars pass me in my tiny Prius C, struggling to look around the big truck parked next to me.  Finally a break in the cars passing, so I start to back out slowly.  Then I see a woman to my right looking terrified, so I stop and look around me and I see a man yelling at me.  I shrug, say "I'm so sorry!", look around me once more and keep backing up.  More yelling as I see a 30 week pregnant woman rushing to walk out of the way as I start to back out again.  Turns out she was in my huuuge blind spot (the corner of my car).  I start crying, yell "I'm so sorry" and finally back out and drive away.

Now I can't stop crying.  I can't be for sure I didn't tap someone with my car because I didn't get out and ask like I should have.  I'm trying to reassure myself that there wasn't frantic screaming as I was trying to pull away, just me getting the finger from the man and yelled at.  I also didn't feel anything as I was backing out.

Now I'm going to live in constant fear for the upcoming weeks that the police are going to show up at my door and haul me away.

Fuck my car's blind spot, fuck my apparently not thorough checking all my mirrors and windows.  At least for once I'm not trying to blame the family, though it did cross my mind for a second.

**EDIT** Thank you all SO MUCH.  I feel so much better.  Went and got my hair cut and have completely calmed down.  DH is even taking me out to dinner to help me feel better too.  Thanks for your kind words and support :) 




 I'm almost 11 weeks and even though I've seen the ultrasounds and my baby is healthy and growing, I don't feel any emotions. 

Husband is freaking out. Asks me "how does it not freak you out that you're growing a human in there??" It just doesn't. I've been hormonal and nauseated, but I don't feel like I've had that "aha" happy moment. 

Maybe when I find out the sex I will feel something? Anyone else have this? 




 So today I had an ultrasound at 6 weeks 1 day.  I've been getting them every week since I'm currently seeing a reproductive endocrinologist.  I went in today and saw the heartbeat!  I also got some blood taken and this is where my question comes from:

Two weeks ago I started Endometrin 100mg once daily.  My levels were at a 13.5 at last week's test.  Then I was upped to 100mg three times daily and I got my blood test back today and my levels went DOWN to 11.5!  I'm freaking out! My doctor hasn't called me yet but I'm so worried.

Anyone been in a similar situation? 




 I'm 6 weeks 1 day today and we saw the heartbeat!  Nurse said it just started in the last couple of days and it's a little overachiever. 

Excited!  Now hoping my bloodwork comes back showing the hormonal supplements are working. I feel like an emotional teenager. Like the world is out to get me or something! 




 I just need a place to vent:

I'm 5+4 today. My Endometrin dose got bumped to 3x daily.  Today was the first day I took 3 doses and I am so hormonal. I got chewed out for making a mistake on one of my 1000 tasks at work because my boss doesn't know how to listen despite my telling him I can't handle the workload. I broke down in front of him, and he's the kind of boss that sees it as weakness and doesn't care about the reasoning behind mistakes. He just wants a "I made a mistake and it won't happen again", and will flat out say he doesn't care about why it happened. 

Then I come home and I'm enjoying a nice evening with my tree-smoking husband. We eat dinner, watch tv, talk a little. About 90 minutes ago he left momentarily. I found out it was to eat an edible and 45 min later he is a different person. I don't mind the occasional bowl, but I hate when he eats them. He won't accept my thoughts that it makes him even more forgetful and ridiculous. He says he's the same as when he smokes, which he isn't. 


So now I'm laying in bed crying while he cooks and stinks up the house to satiate his stupid munchies. I'm pretty sure I've cried for a total of 4 hours today. 

So that's it. Fuck hormones. I'm popping a Benadryl and going to sleep. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading.  




 Hi /r/babybumps!  I got the confirmation yesterday that I am pregnant for the first time ever at 4 weeks exactly!  I was due to start Femera and trigger shot at the start of my next cycle but it never came :D

I have PCOS so I'm cautiously optimistic, though my hormone levels are very well managed with diet and Metformin.  I've been put on Endometrin (progesterone suppository) and Estradiol (estrogen supplement) to make sure everything progresses well in the first trimester.

I just can't let myself be fully happy about this, though.  No matter if it's a pregnancy or something else, I can never let myself get my hopes up.  I'm afraid if I do, they will be dashed and everything will go wrong.

But for now I'm cautiously optimistic and happy.  Due around November 2!  Only told immediate family, best friends, work HR, and YOU.  

More bloodwork tomorrow to see if the supplements are doing what they need to be doing, then an ultrasound next week!!! 




 I've been getting suuuper faint positives for the last few days. Got blood test done yesterday and my levels are:

Hcg: 9.11
Prog: 8.23
Estradiol: 90.5


Comparing these to the levels in September (1.5 years off bc)

Hcg: 1.00
Prog: 0.516
Estradiol: 20

Going in for a retest on Monday! I'm nervous about CP or MC since I have PCOS, but my doc said my hormone levels are good and stable, nothing is way off thanks to keto and metformin. 


MAYBE BABY. SO EXCITED.  




 DH and I are 26.

We have been off birth control since May 2012.  We've had all the tests done.  I have PCOS and hypothyroidism but have regular cycles. Doctor says I'm probably just not ovulating.

After getting all the necessary tests done, I met with my reproductive endocrinologist and he suggested Femera with an injection to force ovulation since my numbers look good. He doesn't want to risk Clomid giving me a Kate Gosselin-like situation.

A little disappointed with the price for ultrasounds/labs for my Femera + injection cycle.  We have the money, but we are saving for a house and the payment would set us back almost a month in savings.

I took OPKs this month and they were positive. Hopefully I'm pregnant now, I'm 10DPO and took a test this afternoon.  Faintest line, can't tell if it's an evap line or not.  I drink a shit ton of water so I figure unless it's the first pee of the day, I won't be getting an accurate result.  Bought a FRER for the day AF is due and ClearBlue Digital for a day or two after that.  Dollar store tests until then, because I'm an obsessive tester.

Thanks for reading! 




 I left the precise numbers at work since I talked to a broker at lunch, but I remember the general gist.  Also, I've read PF's opinion on FHA loans, but bear with me here.

Husband and I are currently spending $1125/month on rent.  We know how much expense goes into buying a house after talking to multiple homeowner family members, but we just have dreams of owning a house and being able to save a little bit more money.  We were originally thinking of a single family home, but after finding out the information below, have been considering a townhome.

We were told that for a $120,000 house in our area, our entire monthly payment will be $1114 at 4.75% interest (a slightly high estimate). 

$600+ for principal and interest

$250+ for taxes (not sure what taxes these are)

$120+ for PMI

$100+ for HOI.

I just wanted to know if this VERY ROUGH estimate is accurate for a FHA loan at 3.5% down payment.  Granted we will most likely be going for a 7.5% down payment in a conventional loan, but my husband's frustrated because he seems to have been wrongly estimating for the last year or so of dreaming of home-owning. 




 Not gonna lie, I've been on and off the keto train since New Years.  I've only gained 3 lbs back, since I'm in the gym and lifting 3x/week and walking a lot more since the New Year

I'm just finding it hard to get back into the groove of things.  I lost my original motivation and I don't know why.  I'm prepping for a meal plan tomorrow for this next week so I don't go off at all.  

I just need some help and I figured this thread might help others who are finding it difficult to stay motivated. 




 Hello everyone!

Not sure what to say on here.  Been lurking for a month or so.  Have been getting more serious about makeup, but still keep my routine to about 10 minutes maximum.  Working on techniques, especially for eyebrows.  

I'm 26 years old, married with 2 cats, working in oil and gas IT departments.  Other than makeup I like to doodle (zentangles), occasionally crochet, read, and spend time in the city since I'm currently stuck in the suburbs.  

That's about it!   














 I see pictures online and tutorials of ladies who do this, but I feel like my lips are so defined (even towards the corners) that if it goes outside my natural lip line, it looks unnatural and messy

Is it just one of those things that's not for everyone? 









 If this belongs in another subreddit please let me know.  I don't think I'm breaking any rules by asking this here.

I've been using some of the online "try on a hairstyle" things.  I can't decide if I like how they look or not.  I'm chubby and I have a round face, though it has slimmed down significantly since the start of my weight loss.  

My husband says I need a pointier face to pull off short haircuts. Can any of you with more experience and less personal bias help me? 

Current hair (no styling, just washed and air dried): http://imgur.com/WAZNn48

Album of "try ons" (hair would still be brown): http://imgur.com/a/dbQYm

Any feedback would be appreciated.  

I know these aren't the best representations, but it's honestly the best I could do with these types of programs.   




 I hope it's ok to x-post!

I got really discouraged last night because the scale has only moved 13 lbs in the last 2.5 months, so I took another progress picture and compared from my first week. I chalked my lack of scale progress to my PCOS and hypothyroidism (both medicated), but seeing the small changes I've made makes me want to keep going!
Down 1.5 sizes in the pants, shirts are getting a little looser.  Lifting progress is slow, but what I see is a pretty big difference!

Don't be discouraged!

Lifting schedule is:

Monday/Thursday: Upper Body

Tuesday/Friday: Lower Body

Upper Body: Bench, tricep pushdown with rope attachment, face pulls with rope (not sure of technical name for this), bicep curls, shoulder press, lat pulldown

Lower body: Leg press, squats, deadlifts, calf raises, lunges, adduction machine, abduction machine

Wednesday and the weekends are rest or cardio days depending on how I feel.  Eating around 1800 calories/day, never going over 24 g carbs.

 I'm currently on W6D2 of a modified C25K called Run 5K (iPhone app).

I usually run around my apartment complex, that way if I start to have a panic attack I can just go back upstairs and relax.  But I've got a race coming up on Thanksgiving.  

I'm well aware that exercise releases endorphins and can make it better, which it seems to about half the time.  I've gotten through all my runs except one without an incident.  

I'd just like to hear experiences  of others with anxiety on this program and with their 5k.  I'm running with a friend and her mom, but they're both faster than I am.  I'm slow as molasses so I'll most likely be alone for the race. 




 Even if you're not done yet, it'd be nice to hear others' experiences.  I've been on keto for about a month now and no matter what I do, I cannot get below 220lbs. Right now I'd just like to hear others' experiences. 




 My husband came up with this to satisfy a craving earlier this week.  I was planning on making keto pumpkin pie, so we had a can of pureed pumpkin. This is what he did:

**Ingredients**

1/2 cup pureed pumpkin

.5 tbsp pumpkin pie spice

1-2 packets splenda

Whipped Cream

**Instructions**

Mix the first 3 ingredients. Taste to see if it's sweet/spiced enough.  Nuke in the microwave for 30 seconds - 1 minute (optional).  Top with some whipped cream.  EAT.

It's super low calorie, *maybe* clocking in at 100 calories if you use canned whipped cream. You'll get a bit of the raw pumpkin twang that you lose when baking a pumpkin pie, but i find it's easy to ignore.  




 I have been missing margaritas something fierce.  I live in Texas and always got a big frozen one when I would go out to get Mexican food.  My mother-in-law found [these](http://www.zilchmixers.com/) at the liquor store and they are pretty good!  Nothing like a true margarita with sugary sweet sour mix, but they do nicely.  Just FYI for anyone else out there missing their margaritas.

 




 I need to fill my instagram with fit women.  I currently follow mankofit and yoga_girl, but I need more. Unfortunately google doesn't have many good results for this question
