 /r/HighHeels  




 No bother at all :) 




 Found out on another sub, it's Cora Skinner :) 




 Dammit, I was trying to find some links to go with the names, but my internet is being shit, so I'll just give you the names.

Charlotte Poole

Nicola McLean

Gemma Hiles

Cara Brett

Chanelle Hayes

Sophie Reade


 




 To each his own I suppose, but as far as bimbos go I certainly don't rate her the hottest in the UK, and not even on the radar when it comes to the whole world! 




 Ah yeah, that was it, cheers :) I'll keep it here then, I'll let the mods decide whether or not to remove it :) 









 Ah, thank you so much. Was the picture in this sub do you know? Or is it ok to leave it here? 














 This picture is sure to get some love in /r/tightdresses :) 




 This picture was posted either on this sub or on /r/legs, I'm not sure which. The reason I'm posting it here (and there) is because someone ID'ed her last time, and I've forgotten her name and really want to get more pics of her! If anyone can link me to the re-post (I couldn't find it), then I'll take this down. If it's not a re-post, I'll keep it here.

 So would I! I'm afraid I don't know who she is, it was a random gif I found :( 




 I'm afraid I don't, it was a random gif I found :(

 Stunning figure and gorgeous as well! 







































 Thank you :) 




 I'm about to play The Witcher 2 for the first time, and have the enhanced edition. I was under the impression that the Full Combat Rebalance mod was created by one of the developers, is that right?. Does that mean it was included in the enhanced edition, or do I still need to download and install it if I want to use it?

Thanks!

 Ah right, it makes more sense now. I wonder why they're less common in certain places. 
























 How can you tell? I'm rubbish at spotting photoshopped stuff :( 




 I absolutely love me a bit of Jordan Carver, but if this isn't a sweater, then I don't see how it's appropriate here. I'm not trying to be a dick, I know this sub doesn't get a lot of posts, but I do think we should stick to what the sub is about, otherwise what's the point of it? 



















 From my experiences of cycling, there does seem to be a nice camaraderie between those of us who travel that way, particularly in cities. Often, when I stop at the lights and another cyclist pulls up, I'll start chatting to them, making the whole journey that bit more pleasant. That doesn't seem to exist with those who drive, but I realise that's because you're both in a box on wheels, and winding down the window to shout across to the other driver does seem a bit crazy. They'd probably be terrified more than anything!

But anyway, yes, this guy was being an arsehole.

ETA: I know these guys aren't on bicycles, but I would imagine there's a similar unspoken bond. 




 I've never been one to comment on what I think is a poor post, I just downvote and move on, but I have to break my silence for this. The joke here appears to be that OP has found something shaped like a Capri Sun carton, but it actually contains soup, is that right? The only way I can see how that would be even remotely funny, nevermind get almost 2000 upvotes, is if these cartons were a novelty or a new item where the OP was from, is that the case? I've seen a few comments here which make me think it could be.

In the UK, at least, these pouches have been on the shelves for years for all sorts of things. [Dolmio](http://uk-pic2.ciao.com/uk/140079923.jpg), [Uncle Ben's](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTdQVkmw3Z3gtnGB_G45TRFKvUeu6zh-aKu80CraxZdRZzWjFsivg), [Maltesers](http://www.americansweets.co.uk/ekmps/shops/statesidecandy/images/british-maltesers-chocolates-case-of-11x-135g-bags-6135-p.jpg), [Soup that isn't Campbell's](http://www.britishsupermarketworldwide.com/acatalog/loyd_grossman_tomato_basil_pouch_soup_420g.jpg). They're so commonplace that it wouldn't even enter my mind that it's like a Capri Sun bag. 

Ah well, to each his own I suppose! I'm off to buy aforementioned products and reap sweet karma!
 




 I'd love it if someone recognised him and he was prosecuted. There's precedent for it apparently, according to one of the links in the comments.

 It reminds me of the picture that was on here recently of the guy planking a tiger in one of those sanctuaries. Harassing an animal for no other reason than an attempt to get a few laughs is pretty pathetic. 




 I'd say rock more than metal, but either way it's brilliant :D

It's not the full thing, but has the titfucking part in it. It's from a clip called Patients Without Borders on the Brazzers website. 




 To be fair to him, when an interviewer once asked him 'What would you be if you weren't a footballer?", he said "Probably a virgin" :D 




 Thanks mate :) 




 I have no idea! I just post things individually in different subs! 




 She's like Miranda Kerr with massive tits. Awesome gif. 


































 We're always looking for fresh posts on /r/bimboxxx, this would be perfect.

:) 



















 Definitely blue for me. 














 Ah! My apologies, I misunderstood. 




 Christ, how long are her legs?? And that mane of red hair is awesome :) 




 I'm genuinely curious as to what it is you find so bad about this picture. I realise you said the majority of the pics, which doesn't necessarily include this one, but that's the implication, seeing as you posted here.

She's wearing a tight dress, what else are you looking for? 




 How do you guys do this? I keep posting smaller pictures because I don't know how to make them high res like that. 




 Thank you :) 




 Ah thanks mate :-) I think I've always just called light blue turquoise so I'll be more careful in the future.  




 I think I need to get my eyes checked. I can see a light turquoise tinge in that dress but it appears I'm the only one! 




 I added a couple already :-) I've subbed to it, I love bandage dresses I'll post more pics when I see them :-) 

















































 Thanks mate :-) 




 I'll dig around for it when I get back from work.  
























 Can't believe I didn't recgonise her, she's one of my favourite bimbos! 




 Ah, sorry, didn't know the name so went by the heading on the picture which said Nichole Roedder for some reason.

Thanks for the correction.

 Wow! The girl on the left is incredible. Looks nice and tall, just how I like them :D

 Ok will do :-)

Edit: never mind its there already. 














 These comics are great. How long does it take you to do one? 




 Incredible cheekbones. 














 This is the incredible Aneta Buena. 









 This is Maggie Green. She is awesome. 





































































 I don't know and it's bugging the hell out of me!! I recognise the face but can't for the life of me remember her name :( :( 




 Love that figure. 




 I love these pictures of women who have really slim waists but still have a nice big ass! 





























 Is this Angie Varona? 









 In case anyone is wondering, her full name is [Leigh Darby](http://www.boobpedia.com/boobs/Leigh_Darby) and she's a British porn star.

 Why do models do this sometimes? i.e. have a bout a million different names they go by. 
































































 I don't mean speculation at the time when Ferguson was leaving and there was still a vacancy to be filled. I mean this utterly pointless speculation about what might be if Mourinho had become Man United manager. Like I said, there are a ton of 'what if's' you could come up with that would affect the league. It's absolute drivel, and it's made worse so when you consider his position on the site. Is this really the best that the BBC's top sports writer can come up with? 




 I don't, sorry :( 




 Yeah it's the speculative nature of the post I'm alluding to. This guy is the chief sports writer for the BBC and he just comes out with the most inane stuff. 

Speculation is for the tabloids as far as I'm concerned. You could literally speculate all day on football matters! What if Rooney had gone to Chelsea? What if Wenger had spent more money? etc. etc. It's such poor quality. 




 As far as I'm aware they went straight for Moyes on Ferguson's advice. But even if they had, the headline would have to read 'What if Mourinho had chosen Man United?'.

It's just so shoddy! 




 I would love nothing more than to say I took this picture myself, but sadly this is not the case.

I'm afraid I don't have a source, sorry :( 




 Yeah, it was the calves that got me!

No name I'm afraid, sorry :( 




 This guy has to be one of the biggest hacks around. When it comes to the Premier League I'm entirely neutral, but even I can see that he writes an inordinate amount of articles related to Man United, and this is his latest cutting-edge offering:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25758108

The chief sports writer, penning an article based on a 'what if?'. It's ludicrous. And to name the article 'What if Man Utd had chosen Mourinho?' is idiotic in itself - Mourinho was never offered the United job!

I wish they'd sack him and use the money they save to bring back 606!!
