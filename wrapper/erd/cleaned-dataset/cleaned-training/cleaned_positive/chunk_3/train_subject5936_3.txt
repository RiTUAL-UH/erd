 First of all, Sir Ian, thank you for being a great British actor and LGBTQ activist - you make me proud to be British.
Is there anything about your career that you want to change/a new direction you want to go in? Have you regretted roles you've done? And what's your favourite wizard joke?
Thank you very much for taking the time in indulge our curiosities. :D
