 My LGS is having sealed commander tournement.  Which deck do you think has the best shot at winning? Which deck seems like the worst? 




 I noticed you are making a casual deck and didn't include balance, tinker, channel or fastbond. This should probably be fixed... 




 Thank you for your input! I included a couple more duals as well as nixing the storm cards, I tried forcing it a couple times and it was far too weak. I was kinda aiming for a more multicolor oriented cube. Should I add more multicolor to emphasize this? Or will this just weaken my cube overall?
