 Mostly just unsettling... 




 Yeah, that's awesome. Much appreciated! 




 Laughed far too much at this!  




 I thought I was the only one!  




 I also hate Christmas and birthdays. Just don't see what the fuss is all about. 




 It drives me insane. A friend of mine finds the sound of a clock ticking calming, meanwhile I'm over here going out of my mind  




 It makes a lot more sense now, and I think the situation right now might be the cause of it. 
Thank you for the replies, it's greatly appreciated :)  




 Yeah I do fear that. I don't think he would do that again though, but it's always a thought in the back of my mind. 




 I only met my dad 2 years ago. He was never there as I was growing up, but over the 2 years we've been close, although recently it hasn't been the same because he lives 25ish miles away.  




 The title is pretty self explanatory. I (18/F) keep dreaming that my dad dies, it has happened every night this week and it's starting to really get to me. 




 Awesome tattoos dude :) 




 Ah, this is amazing! 




 Yes! All the time. Loved that episode
