 You're a great person for wanting to help her,I admire you for it ! x

I'd just say,do things with her that you both like often,it will be great time for you guys as well as keeping her mind off of shit. Be there for her if she needs to talk,especially if you suspect she's been feeling particularly low since she might not be upfront about it. 
Love in itself helps at lot !
 




 I "lost" the love of my life few months ago,unable to let go too and shit,the situation is nowhere near as bad as your friends' tho but i want to try my best to help. 
He might not be able to cut all contact with her for now ( i know i can't ) but it would be good if he tried to slowly let go of her,if she sends him a text maybe he could try to let time pass before answering. Then try to take more and more time to answer every..time. Yeah.
Does he still have the hope he can "get" her back ?

 




 Yeah.. I hope it happens before I go completely nuts because that shit ain't going anywhere good smh. Thank you for the support through it's very nice of you ! :) 




 If you want to talk about it I'm here,I know how scary it can get man I see my sanity going down the drain and it's fucking terrifying :/ 
What made things go this way ? ( if you don't mind the question,through)
