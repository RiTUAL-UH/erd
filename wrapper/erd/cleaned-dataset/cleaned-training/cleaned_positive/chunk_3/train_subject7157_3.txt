 I created my own make up channel recently and I feel that it'd be a great journey for me; to help me learn new things at the same time while making videos and grow.  I also believe this will hone my skills over time.  Are there any tips you can give while creating videos? What should I do and shouldn't do?

Your comments would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks! 




 Thank you so much for the CC, I'll keep that in mind with the mascara, eyeliner, and the lipstick shade :) 




 I just noticed the lower left picture that has a black line on my face - my fault. I cleaned that up already and it looks better without it. So sorry in advanced if anyone sees it lol.

 I am struggling with getting my eyebrows right. This is my first picture posting of me (I used my iPhone)... I hope the lighting isn't too dark.  If it is, please tell me and I may take another clear picture with the DSLR. Many thanks!
