 I think you completely misinterpreted my intent.

1. I'm **probably** a much awesomer guy than I give myself credit. I'm extremely intelligent, but have no desire to **put that intelligence to use.**

2. I'm **capable of so much and I believe** I could do so much, it's just that nothing motivates me.

Meaning, I am a waste of the mind and body I'm in. I have self-efficacy and a high locus of control, but I have little motivation to pursue the ends. 

I don't think I have the motivation for that anymore.

 I am absolutely socially retarded

I'm probably not going to be capable of ever being in a relationship

Due to my complete lack of motivation.

I don't know what it is that **I do wrong** socially really

I'm so disconnected from

I never wanted to talk about my thoughts because I've always known **I was so different** than everyone else.

**I don't really care what happens to me** as long as I'm at peace and don't have to continue fighting or talking to people

 Why am I forced to live and forced to carry a burden of guilt and selfishness if I truly don't want to be here anymore

I don't really think that's talking myself up, but to one their own. 

Try going out to a social place (bar, club, etc.)

I don't drink or like being around alcohol at all. Any place loud = hard on my sensory processing disorder : ( . Loud places are hell for me. I just want to leave instantly.
