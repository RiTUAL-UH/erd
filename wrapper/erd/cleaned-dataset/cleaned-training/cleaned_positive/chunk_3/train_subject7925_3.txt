 I forgot what it's called and a google search failed but I've had those bumps all over my body since I was a kid. Recently they made their way to my face as well, so I started using CeraVe (moisurizer) on them... and they vanished in a matter of a couple weeks. I imagine they'd work on the bumps on my body as well but it's too much of a hassle rn lol
