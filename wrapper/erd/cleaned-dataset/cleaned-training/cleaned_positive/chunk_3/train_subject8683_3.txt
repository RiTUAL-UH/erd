 This is easier. Besides, I have a 65" rear projection television that isn't going anywhere any time soon.

Go ahead, make fun of me for not having a flatscreen. 




 Wouldn't the Dayman be better? He's a master of karate and friendship. 




 Tried it. 




 .... dude. Give me some useful advice or GTFO.

Everyone knows you can't trust a pilgrim. He'll just steal all my land. 




 He's somewhere in the far corner of the basement, near the back of the house. The only way I could get anything into the area between the   basement ceiling and the floor is a vent on the first floor, which isn't near where he is, or a small opening on the opposite side of the basement.

There aren't any openings or vents or anything in or near where this little bastard is camping out. I don't wanna just spray that area and he responds like "Bitch, please." 




 It's the only room that doesn't let in sunlight during the day. I hate light. 




 I don't own any :-( 




 I live alone in a two story house. My bedroom is in the basement, and Jiminy Cricket appears to be between the basement ceiling and the first-story floor.

There's no way I can get up there to track him down, and if he chirps one more time, I'm gonna burn this goddamn house to the ground.

Any tips?

Thanks. 




 I *still* don't know what the actual Morpheus quote is that his meme is based on. 




 I have a shit-load of video files in my Vuze's Xbox 360 library, and I want to be able to separate them within Vuze. Maybe create folders to put them in. Is that possible? 




 What was the actual quote from the movie that was misconstrued in the making of this meme? 




  -Cliche question, but is your dad confidence/brave enough to pull up to a street ball game in the hood and wager to win?

I assume you mean during his time as a pro athlete? 




 Very good question. I'm eager to hear his answer to this one.

Keep em coming, guys. These questions are really intriguing. 




 Amongst players, or people in general? 




 Just NBA, or NBA, NCAA, on the streets, etc.? 




 In the next couple of days at the very least. I hope that's not too late. If so, I guess I can re-post this. 




 That's gonna be a fun one. Can't wait to ask him that the next time I see him. 




 Could you elaborate more? Do you mean as in when he started playing seriously and developing his skills, or just when he started shooting around on milk crates as a pre-teen? 




 _____________

Maybe I should have titled this "AMAA." 




 Backstory if you want:

From Philadelphia, played for the Boston Celtics for only one year before a knee injury. Wasn't as good after his knee was repaired, so he played overseas (mostly in Argentina) for roughly 10 years.

Went to Rutgers Camden in New Jersey, shattered pretty much every basketball record that ever existed there, and is the only player alumus to be drafted by the NBA.

He's about 6'5, I (24M) go about 6'4, and he's about to turn 60. Why this seemingly random information? To let you know that despite being damn near three times my age... I can't beat him one-on-one. He plays every day at the crack of dawn and has the best jump shot I've ever seen in person. If you've never seen an NBA player just shoot around casually (even way past his prime), it's absolutely amazing. They're pretty much superhumans compared to us, even guys like my dad who weren't superstars.

So go ahead. AMA!

**EDIT:** A minor caveat. I did say "AMA," but there are some questions that he might not be willing to answer, so if that's the case, I'll just tell the person who asked.

Basically, I'm saying all questions are fair game, but I can't guarantee he'll answer them all. 




 Ah, okay.

Thanks again. 




 What do you mean? 




 Thanks for the hasty response.

If I take in the actual cooler, do you think they'd be able to match up an adapter for it? 




 I am broke as all hell and can't shell out the money for a can of compressed air. I've even asked people I know if they have one I can borrow, and no dice.

Is this safe or no?

Thanks, guys. 




 I don't know if you even remember this message, but I was looking into 12vdc cables to replace the one on my [laptop cooler](http://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Laptop-Cooling-Turbine-SGA-4000-KKNF1/dp/B004G603E2) that shorted out, like you had recommended.

Did a quick [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=12vdc ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8 aq=t rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official client=firefox-a channel=fflb) and a whole bunch of stuff came up. Will any cord work? If not, how do I make sure I get the right one?

Thanks. 




  Are all the files contained within a single folder or are you trying to identify duplicates across multiple folders?

Many, many folders (hundreds), across two internal hard drives.

 Are you considering all traits of a file when identifying duplicates? Ie. if you have two documents which are identacle in every way except the filename of one is Document.docx and the other is Document (1).docx, are they still considered duplicates?

The program I use, Digital Volcano's Duplicate Cleaner, can search for:

* Same file name
* Same content
* Same artist/title/album (audio)
* Same size
* Same created date
* Same modified date

 What duplicate-finder programs have you already tried which seem to be so slow?

See above.

**EDIT:** For what it's worth, I wouldn't mind doing this in segments as opposed to all at once. I know I can break it down and tell the program to only check for duplicates in such-and-such a folder, or time period, or file size, etc., but that might exclude files that aren't in the search parameters that actually are duplicates. 




 Most duplicate-finder programs take an extremely long time to scan all of my files (which is understandable, since I have so many). Is there any way or any program that's made to find duplicate files on large hard drives in an efficient manner?

Thanks. 




 Sorry if this seems like a silly question to people with more knowledge than I have, but I just don't get it. 




 Yeah, that's fine. No rush.

Thanks. 




 Will you be on in a few hours? I might not be able to test this right now. 




 Ah, I gotcha. [Here's what I got under "Show Statistics."](http://4.imgland.net/IKGUct.png) 




  I would try OpenDNS' IPs just to check (208.67.222.222; 208.67.220.220), and maybe remove the IPv6 DNS settings.

So I should set those IP addresses under my IPv4? And how exactly do I remove the IPv6 DNS? Just choose "Obtain DNS server address automatically"?

 Also, are those settings in your router what Comcast told you to use? I would use (Get dynamically from ISP) unless told otherwise.

I changed it to static in an attempt to [fix a problem I had connecting to online games over Xbox Live.](http://www.pcworld.com/article/242961/how_to_open_up_nat_settings_on_your_xbox_360.html) But I still had the problem in the OP before changing it.

 EDIT: Also, just a minor niggle, probably nothing: Set DNS through EITHER the computer's or the router's settings (preferably the latter).

If I do it through the router, should I just leave everything under "Network and Sharing" (on my laptop) at default or "Obtain automatically from ISP" or whatever? 




 You mean as in, if I had my laptop connected directly to the modem? I haven't tried that, but will do if nothing else works. 




 * [LAN](http://4.imgland.net/E5ddl5.png)
* [WAN](http://4.imgland.net/JTRijW.png)
* [Router status](http://4.imgland.net/mF6jax.png)

I wasn't sure exactly where to go, so I figured I'd just give these a shot. Hopefully one of them is right. If not, would you mind telling me exactly where to find the connection info you referred to? 




 Should I post a cap of my proxy settings? 




 First, initial basics-- Comcast provides my internet, and I use the internet on my laptop with a wireless connection via router.

The router and modem are no more than ten feet away from my laptop at all times, which (I believe) eliminates the possibility of a weak signal (plus the fact that whenever I check the properties of my connection, the signal strength is maxed out).

This also allows me to constantly monitor the status of my connection by looking at the router/modem-- whenever my internet stops working, everything is the same as when it is working. Connection lights are lit, all status lights are green and not blinking, etc. The "wireless connection" logo in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen also stays the same (no yellow triangle with the ! inside).

To specify what I mean when I say my internet "goes out": At random times during the day (I have yet to figure out any type of pattern), web pages won't load, and internet-based programs/devices (instant messenger, torrents, Xbox Live, etc.) will not connect to the internet. However, if any of those programs are *already* running when the internet goes out, they'll continue working; but if I close the program and tried to start it back up during the down time, it won't work. Hope I explained that well. Pretty much, anything that runs perpetually and doesn't have to be reloaded (unlike websites) will continue to work even during this down time.

I attempted to change my IP addresses with [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#setup). Here are some screencaps of my settings:

* [IPv4 settings](http://2.imgland.net/a97T--.png)
* [IPv6 settings](http://2.imgland.net/sje9LH.png)
* [Connection details](http://2.imgland.net/0p-n45.png)
* [Connection status](http://2.imgland.net/I5Dvl0.png)
* [Basic settings (via router interface page)](http://3.imgland.net/f3F5a0.png)

Any help would be appreciated. If you need any more info, feel free to let me know if I left something out. 




 I think Insanity Wolf saw this and pissed himself. 




 Okay. 'Murica?

I thought that maybe there's some kind of official process that the majority of the world uses. 









 I have videos (MKV and M2TS, mostly) that are anywhere from 1-3 gigs in size, and I need to convert them to MP4 (or AVI, I think) format so I can stream them to my Xbox 360. I used this program at the behest of a user on this subreddit, and it worked much better than software I had used in the past. It generally takes no longer than 10 minutes to convert (since it doesn't reconvert or transcode if it's in H264 already) despite the fact that most of my files are at least an hour long.

MkvtoMp4 converts M2TS files fine-- no issues with the sync of the audio and video. Converting MKV files, however, is a different story entirely. Every time, the audio is always about two seconds ahead of the video. I've tried changing certain settings, but nothing has worked so far. I've used search engines to troubleshoot, but haven't had any success.

Does anyone know a possible solution, or perhaps an alternative piece of software?

Thanks. 




 All while pretending that if you don't do everything in time, the refrigerator door will slice your arm off, right? 




 If you open it less than halfway, my refrigerator door closes slowly, like gravity is pulling it.

But now that you mention it, I do not how it does that o_o 




 If not, I'm a weirdo, and I can live with that. 




 This thread didn't go as well as I'd hoped... 




 Store owner: Go away! Stop holding door! You let flies in! 




 How are there over 1,000 people who felt such disapproval with this thread that they couldn't even ignore it and go on with their day, and instead took time out of their browsing to actually downvote the submission? 




  You can't do it externally; you can't set some kind of option to control the pace of the game, but the pace can change over time.

Yeah, I didn't mean like that. I just meant, for example, if someone's rushing you constantly, you can use counters and/or powerful attacks to keep distance between yourself and your opponent and make them play at your pace. 




 "Damn, bitch. That's a shitty tattoo."

"It's a picture of Jesus."

"... fuck." 




 Yeah, but most fighting games generally have a constant pace that it's "supposed" to be played at, right? Like, you can't turn a match into a slow, methodical, systematic fight, or a fast-paced, offense-oriented, depending on what you're good at/what you prefer.

Can you? 




 Now, is he saying he'd encase the immortal in an ocean of concrete, or that he'd give him/her/it the cliche "cement shoes in the ocean" treatment?

And what would stop the immortal from dragging you down with it? You'll drown eventually. The immortal won't. 




 Maybe I'm kind of weird, too picky, or whatever, but I've always loved this in any type of competitive game, but mostly fighters.

Games with matches against one-on-one opponents, where you can take your time, play defense when you need/want to (by using an opponent's moves against them if you're good at countering/blocking, for example), and at times you try to out-think your opponent instead of doing everything physically and/or frantically. That's normally what a real fight between two professional fighters is like. 

Am I mistaken here and most fighting games actually are like that? Are there certain fighting-game franchises (or iterations of franchises) that have this feel more than others? How do they achieve that type of gameplay successfully while still retaining the fun factor? And lastly, does anyone disagree with my opinion on this? 









 I'd tell him that I'm going to end his undefeated streak and I'd make a big deal about it every week and try to convince everyone that it will happen. Then I'd give it my all on the day of the battle and probably end up losing when I make a critical mistake or when I get too tired/beaten-up to continue.

... oh wait, that's Undertaker at WrestleMania. Nevermind. 




 Find something you're good at that others around you aren't, and offer to do it for people, for a small fee. For example: fixing computers, home improvement, car repair (or even washing/waxing cars), lawn care, etc.

The only thing is you wouldn't be licensed at any of these positions, thus you'd likely have no insurance. You need to let potential customers know this fact immediately and make sure they understand. Also, charge them less than an insured company would, obviously, to make up for the fact that you have none. 




 Sorry if this is really obvious to a lot of people. I don't own a smartphone, and whenever I borrow someone else's, I'm amazed at how the phone knows how I'm holding it. 




 You might have jumped the gun with this response just a tiny bit... 




 How the fuck are you not fired yet? 









 Would you accept it? Would you try to prove yourself wrong? How would you do it? 




 All while someone tries to take the hook out and probably makes the wound worse at least half the time?

Does it not hurt them? 









 Close enough. 




 Did that first bee take a bath in a tub of Cheetohs? 




 http://i.lvme.me/6boekf5.jpg 




 Well-played. Not even gonna lie, this made me laugh. 




 Admittedly, I only got it because my friend has worked there for five years, and he vouched for me before I even did all of this 














 It is, if you can afford it. 




 Then give me Option B. I don't see how watching a gruesome death once every seven days would be as much of a detriment than having no arms or hands.

I bet some people watch slasher/horror movies more often than once a week. 




 A blowjob.

I'm very lonely. 




 Can I get prosthetics? 




 Another user proves my point. There's a difference between being chronically depressed and "not being in the mood to do it." That's an excuse a girlfriend uses when she doesn't feel like fucking.

What if I'm so miserable and pissed while I'm there that I try to just keep to myself and pretend I'm not there, but people keep trying to talk to me, and then I have a massive panic attack?

Different story, right? Thought so. 




 I hope this doesn't turn into one of those "On the Hunt for Bigfoot" shows. Nobody ever finds any hard evidence. We'd have *heard about it already.*

Granted, I didn't read the article because I"m tired. 




  Do you really want to know how it is to have special needs? I bet not.

I **DO** have special needs. You're proving my point. Special needs are the same, psychologically or physically. My ailments might not keep me from being able to walk, but physical illness doesn't turn your world into a nightmarish abyss where no one understands you and anything bad or uncomfortable that happens to you can trigger a massive panic attack. 




  People are shit to people in wheelchairs, **the absolute majority only helps if it's their job to help.**

Or if they're family.

Unless you think every parent in the world would ignore their child's needs if the child was temporarily confined to a wheelchair and unable to walk. 




 But I want someone I'm comfortable talking to. Hell, I'm not even comfortable talking to my father about this, and I'm as close to him as anyone. That's probably at least partially due to the fact that he just doesn't get it (plus he grew up teaching me the whole cliche "Men are supposed to man up and bitch-slap their emotions whenever they feel sad" thing).

He and I just think way too differently for him to relate, and it's incredibly frustrating. 




  For video editing etc yes I would look for professional series cards like the nVidia Quadro series

The laptop I'm using now has an NVIDIA Quadro FX 2700M, and it gets about as hot as the surface of the sun.

 If either are located on the bottom of the laptop your cooling is going to suffer severely whenever the laptop is sitting flat on a table etc.

Would that apply if it was on a laptop cooler? 




 Tried therapy. Wasn't surprised it didn't work. I hate talking to people about my problems, especially people I don't know. 




 I hate light. I actually used to be terrified of the dark, but now it comforts me.

I live, alone, in the basement of this two-story house because it's the only room that doesn't let in sunlight. 




  People aren't going to cater to you just because your depressed

"People aren't going to cater to you just because you're in a wheelchair." 




  And the drowning man will sink should he not use his arms to swim.

And I am swimming. I'm taking psychiatric medicines and talking to my physician weekly about my mental health.

But going to this wedding would make the metaphorical "current" stronger and harder to swim against, if not just temporarily. 




   if you don't go you'll feel shitty in your comfort zone and wallow in it for who knows how long

I wallow in depression already.

"A drowning man cares not about the rain." 




 You guys are here, and that's great. I appreciate it. But support from strangers on the internet can only go so far.

As far as meeting people, I don't want to meet people. I hate people. People are the reason I spend 18 hours a day locked in a room with no light and ignoring almost any call I receive on my cell phone.

I can almost guarantee that forcing myself to go would do more harm than good for me. The only reason I'm even considering it is because I owe my dad big time. He is truly the *only* reason I have a roof over my head and food on my plate. He refused to abandon me when I was in desperate straits, and he goes beyond that very often (for example, allowing me to live in the house he owns, rent-free).

So basically, I'll feel like shit if I don't go because he's done so much for me and I'd feel like an asshole for disappointing him.

Or, I can feel like shit if I do go, because it'll be boring, because I hate crowds, I hate people, and I hate being out of my comfort zone. 




  is true strength really a single beam bearing an unbearable load until it can bear no longer, or is true strength having the faith in your fellow man to be able to show your weakness, and be helped by them.

Who's gonna help? Nobody. The best my father does (and I appreciate it) is help me out when I need money for my meds. Other than that, he thinks this whole issue of psychological imbalance isn't even real.

Us 20-somethings (or at least myself and most people I've seen) have parents who come from a generation where a lot of people thought depression/anxiety/mental disorders were all either fake excuses for laziness, a product of literal insanity, or simply hypochondria. I really wish people would read up on things or ask around. My dad's not an idiot, he's just used to old-fashioned values and beliefs. But he's not much of a reader or one to watch educational/documentary programs.

I just want someone, ONE PERSON IN MY LIFE, to understand that having severe depression/anxiety/both is just as bad as being terribly ill physically.

Instead, they think it's not, because there are very few palpable physical symptoms, many of the habits that occur because of depression can be easily confused with laziness, and if you're extremely unhealthy psychologically, you don't need to go to a hospital to stay alive (with obvious exceptions). 




  So, apart from the whole smoke and mirrors raging at life thing, why do you actually not want to go?

I don't understand what you mean by "smoke and mirrors," but it's simple.

This (my home) is my comfort zone. My mind doesn't like it very much when I leave my comfort zone. I need to stay in it as often as possible to avoid spending the rest of my life in a straitjacket.

The only time I'm willing to drag my broken, psychologically crippled ass out of bed is to go buy something I want/need, or to go to work. I don't think it's asking too much that I wish to remain in solitude otherwise. 




 That might have been your brain just thinking crazy (no offense) thoughts because it knew you wouldn't act on it, since you couldn't, what with the building being only two stories.

If you lived on the 28th floor of an apartment building and looked out the window, I'd be willing to bet that you wouldn't have that sudden, out-of-nowhere urge to jump.

But as others have said, there's no reason to take the chance and end up discovering that this isn't the case, before it's too late. Professional help is always good, and it's much less taboo/stigmatized than some people realize. 




 I have traits of a selfish, arrogant, condescending asshole, and I pretty much hate the entire world, but I would take a bullet for one person and one person only-- my father.

If it wasn't for him, I'd be penniless and homeless right now, having lost my job two years ago. He lets me live in the two-story house that he owns, while he and my stepmother live together a few minutes away. He's always willing to help me with anything even somewhat important, and he constantly refers to the home I live in as (and treats it as if it's) "My house," despite the fact that I haven't given him a dime in rent money.

Funny thing is, I've never been close to a situation like that where I'd have to potentially die to keep someone else from doing so. I don't know how I know I would do so for my father... I just know that I would. Without a doubt. 




 If it makes you feel better, your brain compounding negative occurrences with negative thoughts is actually your brain trying to help you.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/12yk37/how_i_feel_right_now/c6za4xk

I'm not 100% sure he's correct, but it seems plausible and makes sense to me.

My advice would be to see a doctor or a psychologist. The latter if you think talking to someone about your problems would help (a lot of people in your situation are the complete opposite, and it's understandable), or the former if you think psychiatric medication would be better (it's worked for me... kinda).

Hope you feel better. 




 A few months ago, I told my dad I'd go to my stepsister's wedding (Sunday, August 11th-- tomorrow as of this writing). I'm not close to her at all, or my stepmother, but my dad just married my stepmother and he really wants me to go.

One problem-- I feel like utter and complete shit right now because of recent events, and I know I'm gonna feel like shit tomorrow. I guarantee he's not gonna want to hear any of that, though. But if I was in the house coughing up blood, vomiting and having a fever of 102 degrees, I bet you he wouldn't give me shit about not going. Those physical ailments I just described are pretty much analogous to how I feel psychologically right now.

* "Man up and go."

* "Stop making excuses."

* "You're being ridiculous."

Would you say that to someone who was extremely sick physically? Of course not. But if you feel like shit psychologically, for some reason, it doesn't count.

Also note that I'm 24 years old and I live alone, so he made it clear that since I'm an independent adult, the choice is up to me. It's not a "If you don't go, I'm gonna beat your ass" or "I'll kick you out of the house if you don't go."

My dad is a really tough guy, and he doesn't show great sadness and such very often. But if I don't go, I get the feeling he'd be as close to heartbroken as he's been recently, because he (like many people) doesn't understand what depression and anxiety are like separately, much less combined. 

**EDIT:** Another reason he'd be really upset is that he'd think I was doing it out of selfishness, disrespect, or both, not because I feel terrible. Do you guys think there's any way to convince him otherwise? 




 So, in the future, should I look for a similar make and model of graphics card, just one that doesn't suck ass? What's the best way to tell before purchasing a laptop if the GPU will be able to handle the load that I'd put on it? 




 There is absolutely no hard evidence or physical proof at all. None. There's just speculation, assumptions, blatant untruths, misconceptions, etc.

Meanwhile, despite the onus being on the theists, there is MUCH better evidence for the lack of the Christian god's existence.

Put it like this-- I've said this before and I still think I'm right:

**There's more evidence to support the existence of Bigfoot than there is to support the existence of God.** 




 Save. Your. Fucking. Money. You. Retard.

-slap- 




  the only laptops in my experience that achieve mediocre success when it comes to idle temps are gaming laptops that have been designed to tolerate and perform under heavy system loads for extended periods of time.

It's funny, because I remember asking a few people if I should just get a gaming laptop so that I'll know the GPU and everything will be on point and able to handle a heavy load. They all said no, since gaming laptops are designed explicitly for gaming, and won't do as well with video editing as I thought.

Is that correct? 




 Very good explanation. Another thing to consider is that the free safety, being quicker and faster, is usually the last line of defense in a defense with only one player back.

He's also usually the better safety, between the two, at guarding receivers, so they may assign him to a WR if need be, where a strong safety is more likely to blitz or maybe pick up the running back. 




 The best explanations I've seen (which isn't saying much) are "Such-and-such happened, we don't know how, so it must have been God."

Things like evolution, or the fact that the Earth is almost perfectly positioned to support life, or the fact that atheist claim that the universe was created from nothing, etc. 




 What type of specs should I look for in a new laptop? GPU, CPU, RAM, etc. I need to be able to use high-end video editing programs (Sony Vegas, Adobe After Effects, etc.) without the computer feeling like it's about to burst into flames.

I assume the best GPUs are going to be in the most expensive laptops. 




 Remove dust how? Simply by hand?

I don't trust myself to do that. I'm not very... handy. I'm afraid I'll screw something up. 




 [This is what my GPU usually looks like after I've been browsing the web (no videos, no games, nothing that should stress the graphics card).](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png) Not good. So I decided to do the following:

Shut my computer off for the night (not sleep, not hibernate, completely shut down), and thus, it cooled down for a good 7-8 hours. Then, I turned it on, cut off my wireless internet connection so no programs that use the internet would activate automatically, and didn't run any programs save for three: Task Manager, Speccy (to monitor GPU), and Core Temp (to monitor processor cores).

After 58 minutes of idling (most of which was spent with the display turned off, since it automatically does so after two minutes-- just the display, not the computer itself. Like a screensaver), my GPU was at 65C, and my processor cores were at 59 and 60C respectively. I had absolutely no applications running (if you had looked in my Task Manager "Applications" tab, it would have been empty).

The computer was also hot to the touch, despite the fact that, just to make it clear, I didn't touch the computer once after starting it up and running the Task Manager, Speccy, and Core Temp.

Now, I know there a few possible solutions, and I have some questions about those.

* Compressed air to clean out potentially clogged fans/heat sinks. I'm REALLY broke right now, but I'm trying to scrounge the money to grab one or two. Let's say I do, and I use it, and it still overheats? Then what?

* I also have a laptop cooler that I used to use that actually helped keep the computer a little bit cooler, which is better than nothing. But there's a short in the power cord now, and I don't have any soldering tools or expertise to fix it myself. I tried to search the internet for somewhere I can buy just the power cord, since buying a new cooler would be pretty pointless. Nothing wrong with mine except the power cord. Does anyone know where I might be able to find a power cord for [this cooling pad?](http://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Laptop-Cooling-Turbine-SGA-4000-KKNF1/dp/B004G603E2) Also, is there maybe a common household item(s) that I can use until I get a new cord/cooler?

Thanks, and if I left anything out or wasn't clear, please let me know. 




 Would the lack of sunlight cause health issues? If not, gimme that. I love gray, cloudy days. The sun can eat a dick, making everything all bright and shit. 




 Thanks for the quick response. I'll probably have a little more to add to help you guys help me.

For shits and giggles, [here's my motherboard](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/Motherboard.png). I assume this is almost a direct result of the piece of trash NVIDIA calls a GPU.

No bueno. 




 A person's name affects their entire life?

Oh, boy... 




 I've never in my life seen so much embarrassing nonacceptance in one place. 




 Don't act like Hunter isn't a badass first name.

Triple H agrees. 




 Hey, guys. I don't accept other people's viewpoints on things! That makes me cool, right???? 




 None, because parents can name their kids whatever the fuck they want. 




 [Here's the specs on my GPU.](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png) I wasn't doing anything except browsing the web (no videos, no games, not even an animated smiley in an IM program). As such, you can see that it kinda sucks.

If I have the CPU idle, my GPU temp shouldn't ever go over like 40 or 50C, right?

Also, what's defined as idling? Would that be when the load is under a certain number (and, presumably, "System Idle Process" is in the 90s)? Can you leave a computer on as long as you want and still have it be considered idle? I was going restart the computer for the night so it cools all the way down, and then leave it on for 30 minutes with no programs running, except Speccy to monitor the GPU.

Good idea, bad idea? Did I have any misinformation above?

Thanks. 




 This only counts if you got her phone number. Unless you knew her already. But have an upvote anyway for the clever line. 




 Is there a way to check if background processes/bloatware are even the problem? I don't wanna go through all the processes and then find out it was never an issue.

My CPU generally stays at a load of 5 or below when I'm just browsing the internet or something. It's just that I think the video card overheats for no good reason, which overheats the motherboard, which makes my laptop feel like the surface of the sun to the touch.

**EDIT:** For example, right now, like I said, I'm doing nothing but browsing the web. I've got 12 tabs open, but nothing at all that should cause a heavy load. I'm running no other programs except Core Temp, Speccy, Yahoo IM, AIM, and Task Manager.

Despite this, my GPU is at 69C (very high, according to [this](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png)), and doesn't appear to have any plans to drop below that at all any time soon.

I'm not watching any videos, I'm not using anything like Sony Vegas or Adobe After Effects, and I'm not streaming anything anywhere. I'm convinced my GPU just sucks balls. 




  I think it's unfair to call someone's marriage that ends in divorce a result of solely bad decisions. People do change. 

I can understand that. I just have an aversion to the logic in the OP since it implies that the nature of marriage causes divorce, not the people who get married.

Kinda like the whole "Guns don't kill people, people kill people" thing. 




 I really don't like it when people say someone has such-and-such a chance of doing something because that's the average. If a person is careful who he/she marries, when he/she marries him/her, and makes sure that everything is as stable as it can be, I'd say they have a much better than 50/50 chance.

The fact that half of American marriages end in divorce, or whatever the hell the number is, has no bearing on a specific marriage. It's not the idea of marriage that causes it-- it's people's bad decisions. 




 Hehe, #3 looks like the Monopoly guy 




 I'm not an expert by any means, but I own several external HDDs, and all I do is plug em in, select the files I want, select "Copy," choose the (C:) or (E:) drive, and let the computer do the rest.

I don't know how many files you want to copy or how large in file size they are, so there may be a more efficient way. 




 Gotcha, I understand.

Thanks for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. 




 There's really no way to do it without taking the laptop apart in some manner? 




 I'd probably end up killing myself, my computer, or both.

Let's say I do get my hands on some compressed air. What exactly should I do to ensure I clean the interior of my laptop as thoroughly as possible? 




  The fact is, you have a Dell, they've probably disabled whatever features, if any, might be used to safely downclock in software.

I thought underclocking would affect hardware, not software? 




 I know this will sound like I'm being stubborn, but I honestly do not have enough faith in myself to take apart and reassemble a laptop. I practically live on my computer, so if anything happened to it, I'd be pretty screwed. 




  What? Could you open up task manager and tell me which program or process is causing this?

It's always something that could not possibly be the cause, like Task Manager or Windows Explorer. The computer just overheats so much it can't even handle simple tasks for the time being.

**EDIT:** And what's the best way to disable background processes, and knowing which ones I should and shouldn't disable? And what's "bloatware"? 




 I'm telling you, I can't get ahold of a can of compressed air. Unless there's a common household item I can use as a substitute, this isn't happening unfortunately.  




 You mean like an external hard drive plugged into the USB?

All taken within the last 2 minutes.

Now, I've heard (and not necessarily saying I don't believe) that most high-end laptops can handle 100C without potential system damage. But the issue here is that the computer reaches temps as high as 80 or above (shown in screenshots), despite the fact that I only have the following programs open:

* AIM
* Yahoo IM
* Firefox (admittedly, 9 tabs, but just Google, a message board, Reddit, Wiki, and TV Tropes)
* uTorrent
* Task Manager

Now, I believe my graphics card (NVIDIA Quadro FX 2700M) is known for being a piece of shit, mostly in terms of playing video... but I haven't watched any videos since I turned the computer on an hour ago (confirmed in Task Manager). I haven't run any other programs other than Speccy, which I closed after taking the above screenshots.

Like I said, I haven't done anything but browse a message board or two, as well as Reddit.

It seems like underclocking/undervolting are my only options. There's no way I can take my laptop apart to clean the fans (I have no experience whatsoever in doing so), and I can't get my hands on a cooling pad or a can of compressed air (long story).

How much can I underclock/undervolt? Is there a limit? I'd really like my laptop to stay below 60C at almost all times. If this means a sacrifice of performance, I can live with that. I just hate the feel of a scalding hot laptop (I can feel it even as I type), and it causes the computer's CPU Usage to jump to 100% at random times when I'm not doing anything that would consume enough power to take the laptop to full load.

Any comments, questions (if I left out important information or anything), suggestions, all are welcome.

Thanks, guys. 




 They may have been a friend at one point, but eventually, they became an enemy without your knowledge. 




 It does come from your enemies. You just don't know they're your enemies yet. 




 I have some pills I have to take three capsules of, three times a day. So what I do is I take 9 out of the big container, and put them into a smaller, empty container. That way, I have what I know is a day's worth in one container, so I know it should be empty before I go to sleep.

Not trying to steal OP's thunder, just something I thought I'd share. 




 Would you give him the money if he didn't graduate, or is it sort of a reward for finishing school? 




 Now we need touch screen spring-action phones

 Firefox 22.0 




 Ah, sorry. Firefox 




 When I want to Google something, all I do is type a word or phrase in the address bar and press Enter, and it searches for it on Google.

Somehow, and I honestly can't remember how, it got changed from going to Google to AOL. Can I change it back? 




 I wanted one of those so bad. And tbqh, I still do. 




 Touche. But it wasn't in the form of a question I WIN!

 So, who's gonna make the lewd comment about the boy's mother saying his jacket smelled like "bush"? Any takers? Going once... 




 What if I told you it's supposed to be? 









 Isn't it illegal, via the terms of service of most sites like this, that you don't share your account with anyone? 














 My internet goes out randomly for 2-3 minutes at a time, and I've determined that it's not some kind of electronic interference from other appliances, it's not the internet connection itself, and it's not the signal strength.

As such, I was suggested to change what's apparently called my "DNS switchboard" from my ISP to Google Public DNS.

On [this page](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#setup), step four of the process reads:

*Select the Networking tab. Under This connection uses the following items, select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and then click Properties.*

I have both IPv4 and IPv6. How do I know which one to choose? 




 So that if you drop of a glass or a plate, it doesn't break into a million pieces. 














 I've always loved the *Saw* series, and I find myself enamored with John Kramer's machinations. I've often thought of what kind of "game" he'd force someone I know to play, or even myself. So hit me, Reddit. 

Oddly enough, this is one of the few times when I hope this WON'T reach the front page. That'd be a lot of work.

**EDIT:** Also, depending on how many I have to do, I might not be able to get to these tonight. I'll try my best, though.

**EDIT 2:** If you don't mind, let me know if you're male or female and your age. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, it's okay. Just don't even mention it in your comment. 









 Russian Roulette, "Chicken" on railroad tracks, you name it. Anything where a life could potentially be lost.

And whatever you can potentially win, you have to provide 1/5 of that total. So if your number is $10,000, you've got to be able to throw $2,000 in, and four other people will do the same. This info is just there so you can think about if paying 1/5 of [x amount of] dollars is worth doing something that could kill you, or make you five times richer.

If you wouldn't do it for 1/5, would you for 1/10? 1/20? 







































 Once I start taking them, you're really gonna make me call my doctor every time I get a refill, even though I brought in the confirmation note for the prescription the first time?

I'm over here losing my goddamn mind because of Xanax withdrawal, and I have to wait til tomorrow to get a refill (haven't had any since Friday) because I have no minutes on my cell phone and I was forced to make an appointment with my physician.

Ugh. Just venting. Sorry if this sounds bad or weird.

As you can see, the graphics card overheats (which I think is a consistent problem with this specific video card), which causes the motherboard and processors to over heat, and that causes my laptop to stall and struggle to run the simplest of tasks because of the excess heat. Plus I don't think that a constant temperature of ~75C is healthy for a laptop.

I'm looking for anything, *anything* at all that even has a chance of maybe helping with this problem. Software, BIOS updates, changes to any settings on the computer (such as under Control Panel, etc.). Anything. Anything at all.

Thanks in advance. If you need any more info, it shouldn't be a problem at all for me to provide it. Feel free to tell me if I've omitted anything important. 









 [Computer specifications](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png)

I can't watch a high-quality video (even on YouTube) without the graphics card overheating, which then overheats my processors and motherboard. At that point, the CPU Usage skyrockets to 100%, and stays there while I can't do much of anything. I can move the mouse and click things and everything still technically functions normally, just *extremely* slowly. As if the computer is struggling to carry out the simplest tasks because the video card is so weak but is also trying its hardest to maintain quality video feedback (which it doesn't more often than not).

What are my options other than "Buy a new laptop"? 




 We know one wild bull will gore everything with a heartbeat, but what if *another* bull was introduced? How would they act towards each other and towards the matador? 




 I mean, how badass would it be to see your supervisor, maybe some older fat dude who doesn't look like he's ever been in a fight in his life, pull a gun during an attempting robbery at your workplace?

And when I say it "goes out," I don't mean that my modem/router doesn't pick up a connection. It still does, and I'll stay connected to my wireless network on my laptop, but web sites won't load. However, if I have something running that runs perpetually and doesn't have to be reloaded (like Xbox Live, instant messenger programs, torrents, etc.), they will stay connected to the internet (i.e., torrents will still download, I can still send/receive IMs, can still play games online, etc.), even while I can't access web pages.

When this happens, nothing on my router/modem changes. All the lights are lit, and it shows that I'm connected to the internet.

I made this thread before but forgot about it, so I wasn't able to confer with other users. I was given the following advice:

***You could try adding Google's DNS to your settings, it's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Or some other DNS service.***

***Try this. It sounds like a service on your router is crashing (probably DNS) and the 2 or 3 minutes if how long it takes your router to notice and restart the service. Using an external DNS will solve this by removing your dependency on the crashy DNS server.***

So, three questions:

1. Is this the best way to remedy this? If not, what is?
2. How do I go about doing this?

Thanks 




 And what, if anything, did the FCC have to do with this decision?

**EDIT:** Just in case some people don't watch the show, I'm referring to the TV series *South Park.* 




 I made this thread a few days ago, starting off with "Zoologists/animal experts of Reddit," but now I realize that pretty much anyone could have a good answer for this thread. 









 Other than "Holy shit I can't believe the religious conservatives haven't gotten this cancelled yet." 














 I've attempted to convert four MKV files to MP4 format. The first three had the audio out of sync with the video, but one of them had no sync issues whatsoever.

Any ideas as to what the problem could be? Should I post the codec info for the videos that didn't work and the one that did? 














 **NOTE:** This is a re-post from last night. No one responded (I assume they wouldn't, since it was late), so I hope doing this isn't against the rules/rediquette. I did read through them both to make sure it isn't, but if I missed something and it actually is against the rules, I apologize.

[Here are my system specs](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png), courtesy of Speccy. As you can see, my graphics card kinda blows (I wasn't doing anything that should strain the video card-- not watching videos or playing games. Just surfing the web), even though I believe it was touted as one of the most powerful when it was released.

My laptop is a Dell Precision M6400 workstation (released in 2008). I will admit that at times, I do use strenuous programs-- mostly Sony Vegas for video editing. I have a CM Storm laptop cooler, but there's a short in the power cord and it won't work unless I hold it a certain way, and I can't do that and use the computer at the same time.

Unfortunately, I can't afford a new laptop cooler, much less a new computer. Are there any ways to keep my laptop cool consistently, or to cool it down when it gets past my preferred temps (without shutting it down or putting it in Sleep/Hibernate mode)?

I've actually heard of using ice to keep one's laptop cool-- does this really work? I can't remember the specifics, but I definitely remember reading that at least twice on this subreddit.

**Also, a disclaimer-- I'm 99% sure that I won't be willing to take the laptop apart at all. The warranty expired a long time ago, and I know jack shit about advanced computer hardware.**

If you need any other information, don't hesitate to let me know.
