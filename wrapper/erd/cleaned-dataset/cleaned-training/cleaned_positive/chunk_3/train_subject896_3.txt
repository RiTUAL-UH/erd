 I just read that whole article. Some ... things... need to be wiped off the planet. THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IS WHY WE DONT INBREED
 




 Got it! Thanks dude!:) 




 Everyone is welcome to join me  GT Troop4921 




 Hey guys; Im going to give you a few of the shortcuts I have found that still keep it legit. [Spoiler](#s "THERE ARE NO SHORTCUTS") 




 SQUAT JUMPS WORK WONDERS
 




 Well, I dont need the points so here you guys go!
W0WTH-ISN07E-V3N7H-47HARD-H4H41 




 Guys I just beat it:D #GetOnMyLevel 









 Okay I guess your right about first posting this in /r/Morrowind. Its not that he traveled back in time, it starts in Morrowind and with him being a vampire, he lives through the time into Oblivion, then into Skyrim. I planned on it being a series through all three games. I will x-post this over onto /r/Morrowind and see the results there first. Thanks! 




 I agree. I dont know, cause not all the races only have babies with their race. 




 Hey guys ac here! So, if any of you saw my last post on [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/1gy6l5/troopor_train_subject896_plays_skyrim/) I do youtube videos of Skyrim. Now the ones that were linked were before I got my Roxio Game Cap so they were all recorded on a little flip camera.
Well, a few months ago I got Morrowind GOTY and had started playing. I stopped and thought about it for a second, and I said to myself "Why not make a series?!"(BTW This was before my Skyrim videos flop)
So heres the pitch on the series:
Its a semi RP. My character is a Dark Elf assassin, sent back to Morrowind from Tamriel because of a slight crime commited(petty theft or assault). He is in his mid to late 20's and is very agile and quick moving. He quickly decides to become a member of the Dark Brotherhood to progress his abilities further. Along the way, he decides to become a vampire. After advancing all the ranks of the Brotherhood,  he realizes his true calling(main story) and does that. Knowing he now has the ability of immortality, he sets out to conquer all things, Morag Tong, Thieves Guild, all sides quests. After doing so and amassing a horde of weapons, armors, and ancient relics, he creates a tomb for himself where he rests for ages. Until he is awoken upon a ship bound for Tamriel. He asks a shipsmen what day it is and he responds : "I believe it to be Morndas, on the 3E 433. Why do you ask?".

What do you guys think? Please be open and responsive!:) 




 I say roughly 200+ years AFTER Skyrim. I wish your character could be like the descendant of like any famous character from previous games. 




 I try for the DLC cause I need achievements 




 Okay Idea for a tag since RDDT is out of the question. R37? R for reddit, the 3 to somewhat represent the D, and 7 for Bungie and T 




 Hell, you can get a good 1Tb for $100 and thats what im doing in a month. Id suggest the 32 




 Idk if theyre down but there is so few players it's almost impossible to play. I just hopped off and there were only 205 players on 




 After a long night of ODST and eventually a bit of 3, we decided to flip the Elephants in Sandtrap. /u/The_Amazing_KyleClam, VPR Viper, Sinisterspade7, and myself succesfully flipped it. I know its not the first time this has been done but we were so proud when we got it flipped!

 alright turning on my xbox now lol had to wrap up some things 




 Alright, I'm getting on now so if you want to work on some, message me! 




 This is genius but not my favorite. I love Dominion and the DLC playlists to much to have to deal with a bunch of people who arent there for it. The DLC list is very worth it cause I remember in Reach, you could hardly get a DLC match cause of the people that didn't have it. 




 Woo! Halfway in and I've already beat Halo 2! Now on to ODST! 




 Yeah, im using a crappy free live streamer so this is the best quality and fps i can get. As for the audio, I don't know whats going on
 









 Yess sir! Im going to play all the games on 7/7 for the pure enjoyment
 




 Why not July 7th?(; 




 Alright, im working on them now since I have a bit before I start my livestream again
 














 Hey hey, /u/IKissMyCousin, I didn't recognize the name but recognize the GT! and /u/Mercutio77, I might get on XBL later tonight. Keep watch! 




 Hey guys! I'm back after a 9 day hiatus (went out of town), and ready to play it up! So, as a few of you might know, about 2 weeks ago I posted that I was working on 100% of the Halo series. Well, I still am and I want to work on the Vidmaster challenges of Halo 3 and ODST(preffered). So if you would like to help me get any of these please message me on XBL @ Troop4921. If you want to see what achievements I am currently still working for, you can go [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1fztc6/working_on_100/) 




 GT: Troop4921 hmu if you still need help 




 Got a solid 3/15 now. Pretty proud. 




 Any size idea? like are we talking 4 GB or like 14 GB 




 I use the Triton Halo 4 series and they work wonders for me.
 




 x-post this on /r/ODST and hope. There are some people who view it regularly. 




 Yes there is and I just so happen to be a moderator for it!:) 




 Would you please put this on /r/ODST for me:) Trying to get some people on there:) 




 Um yes Ill order ten please 




 I loved 3's
 




 I would go to Trevalyn
 




 Very dissappointed with myself. Only got 1/5 and that was #5 cause Cole Protocol was my favorite book that I read three times. Jeez. I need to fill up on my knowledge again. 




 Alright thanks:) 




 Thank you! It was such a time consumer but it ranks up there with my favorite Halo achievements. We've decided soon were going to LASO H4 and see how well that works. Any advice? 









 Hey guys! Itsa me! AC! /u/IKissMyCousin , /u/Yummy_Tiger, and I [plus a friend whose not on Reddit :(] all tackled the Ach. Vidmaster Endure in Halo 3: ODST which is to ENDURE 4 whole sets of fire fight. If you never played ODST firefight, heres a break down. There's sets which are composed of 3 rounds which are composed of 5 waves. If you did the math, we did roughly 64 waves (including bonus). It took us our estimated 2 hours but was very satisfactory in the end. If you wana look at a bit of our results, check it out [here](http://train_subject896.imgur.com/all/).
Past that, contact us and we'll be more than willing to help again I'm sure! 




 Yes, Yes I would! I haven't very many and I'm working on 100%ing all the series so YES! Gt; Troop4921 




 I should also add my GT is troop4921
 




 Id be up for it! 









 Can't say as I blame you but I think if I do get the Exxone it will be JUST for Halo 5 




 TWAT?! WHY NOT?!
 




 okay then. I aso had a few friends clarify for me
 




 Consider me in. Problem is, im pretty sure you get the Mark VI from solo legendary. GT Troop4921
