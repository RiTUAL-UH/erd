 Bad Diary Days by Pedro the Lion. Originally heard it as a cover, fell in love with it, and then looked up the original and fell in love with it even more.  




 I was introduced to this magical delicacy over thanksgiving. I ate the entire tray of them.  




 My favorite shirt in sixth grade was a bright orange tight fitting shirt with white stitching that I colored green. It was slightly see through too, so I thought it was cool to wear different patterned tank tops under it. How I 
thought this was a cute look, I will never know... 




 Oh my god, I'm not alone! I usually notice it and just squeeze it out. 




 This is so true! I grew up on military bases, and some military wives have to be the most horrible people I've ever met. My mom has had "friends" go to the Sergeant Major of my father's unit saying that she burned us with cigarettes, locked their children in closets (she baby-sat these women's kids a lot), and some other made up shit. Why? Because one of these women was cheating on her husband and my mom told her that she didn't think that what she was doing was right, and said she did not want to associate with her anymore. Luckily the Sergeant Major realized they were full of shit and just wrote it off. Military wives can be vicious. 




 For humorous purposes. 




 Wow, I am too jealous of your hair! It looks amazing :) I have the same type of hair you do, so I'll definitely have to check this out if it makes your curls look this great!  




 Maybe he means pedestrian as in somebody who doesn't stand out?
