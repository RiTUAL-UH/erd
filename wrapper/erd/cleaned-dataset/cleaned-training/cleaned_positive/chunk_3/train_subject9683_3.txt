Now my dreams are gone.

Shouldve read first.

This is why my life sucks. Welp might as well delete my post. 

I'm just going to have to get fake followers and hope for recognition, my dreams are ruined, and the sad thing is, now i'm coming off as more of a attention seeker, and now people definitely won't care, but then again, I don't know how this subreddit treats people with dreams like me, idk if they're trolls or caring.

I guess /r/NBA or /r/basketball are similar.

You should promote me because, I think shot blocking is becoming a lost art in the NBA, and defense should be appreciated more, plus i have no subscribers :'(.

 Post things that are just downright sad, that make you "cri evrytiem".  
Examples of "cri evrytiem" moments are:  

* Studying all night for a test, only to fail
* Dying on your last life in a video game

You get the point.  
The Term "cri evrytiem" is commonly used in YouTube video when  
someone dies or fails. YouTubers usually will add a caption stating  
"Liek dis if u cri evrytiem".  
Rules are as follows:  
* Any off topic posts will be deleted
Yea....that's pretty much it.
