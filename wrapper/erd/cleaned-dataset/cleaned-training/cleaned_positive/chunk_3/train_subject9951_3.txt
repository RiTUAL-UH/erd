 Thank you! I think I was relying too much on the packaging I am familiar with.  




 Thank you! I didn't know that. Though the shape and length look different, I think it's the perfect thickness!  




 Thank you very much! I have yet to spot a Müller so I'll look for one.  




 Stereotypically, people always say that Germany is full of introverts, people don't talk to each other .... maybe that's the truth in big cities like Berlin, but definitely not where I am (which is still pretty big in European standards, half a million people). People here are so friendly, some will talk to you for no particular reason. I used to live in Montreal (more than 3 million people), and unless you know someone, you don't look at them, you don't acknowledge them, you stay in your lane. Germany so far has been different.  

And the only odd or outcasts I have met in my life were all in primary school. Primary school was good for me because I was just "shy", and not anxious or asocial. In High School, they were no outcasts. It was an all-girl school so I guess we just got each other's back (doesn't mean we all loved each other, but everyone had at least a group of friends). In College, I don't see how it's possible to spot those people when you barely see the same people twice in the semester, unless they're in your class. And in class, it's hard to tell who's odd or boring or whatever. 

I personally don't really find people boring. I mean, their personality cannot be. I could think that something they're interested in is boring for me, but the fact that they're into it is not. For instance one of the person I'm living with is into Stark Trek. He bought this Stark Trek board game, and I enjoyed watching him play. Would I play myself? Never. Too boring (plus if you need to talk in a game, I'm not into it). But watching people into it playing was really fascinating and cool.  




 Thank you! Yes, they are the very thick ones, and very long. They are almost like a diaper, sometimes too big to even fit your underwear. I have seen the ultra ones and they seem so thin!  




 Thanks for the links and the info! However, I do not like thin pads, and I do not like short pads. I really don't care about looking like wearing a diaper, for some reason, I am extremely prone to accidents and those "diaper-like" sizes have been the most helpful. 

And yeah, Always sure is expensive, but it works well! : )

Edit: Okay, you said expensive. I was thinking like 5-6 euros for a pack of 20 (since it was 7-8 dollars in Canada), but I went on Amazon, and the cheapest I found was 75 euros. What?!?! 




 Hello. I am a girl, dealing with girl stuff once a month. 

I just moved to Germany two months ago, and, well, that time of the month is about to come by for the third time. I planned ahead before leaving, and I bought enough pads for the first two times. However, my supply is already running low. So my question is, [where can I find this specifically](http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/492963/220.jpg)? I have been to Rossman, Lidl, DW, and all I can find are thin pads or tampons. I do not like tampons. Please help?

I am in Hannover, if that changes anything, but honestly, I am willing to travel far and wide for those pads. 

Thank you : )
 




 I have social anxiety too, actually. And I had therapy for that. My therapist had a hard time understanding why I wasn't trying hard enough, even though I really was. She would force me to do those things I don't naturally do, like looking up when I walk or look people in the eyes during a conversation. I wouldn't start conversation with strangers (or anyone) unless I had to. I think the anxiety is milder now, which I am thankful for. 

I have had some pleasurable social interactions, but they were usually because I was doing something I loved first, and people just happen to be there with me. Back in my home city, there was this hipster café I absolutely loved. I would go out with a couple of high school classmates there only because I knew that, one, I loved the atmosphere, it helped my anxiety calm down. Two, there is wifi, and being young adults, we love our internet (so quiet time for me). Three, the food was amazing and I am a food lover (more quiet time for me). Them being here was no problem, and being in a place that promoted non-awkward silences helped a lot. But that doesn't really make me happy. I want it to make me happy. 

Now I have been in Germany for two months. I have no friends or acquaintances at all, and I seldom talk to people back home. It doesn't bother me, I don't feel the need to go and be sociable. But the people I live with, a lovely couple and their baby, are so happy that sometimes, I can't help but wish I had their life. However I know being in a relationship will not happen, and having a social life is unimaginable. I think I could be a mother, but how good of a mother can I be? Another topic, still figuring myself out in that department. 

Anyway. Sorry this came out long and uninteresting. But having depression, anxiety, and SPD at the same time? It's like someone wanted me to have a shit life. And they've been successful so far.  




 Thank you! I have been trying meditation for a while but I'm having trouble "quieting my mind". Any advices?  




 Ah thank you. When I will be able to get help, I will ask if I can try it maybe. I'll read about it first though.  




 I understand, that I am not SPD, but I still have it. It was not a choice, and I am finding it hard to accept (at least right now). My brain is in constant contradiction mode. The things I want to enjoy are things I cannot enjoy. I can get out of my shell, fake the best social skills in the world, go out with a a few high school classmates with whom I felt comfortable to talk with, and .... I don't enjoy it. I can't enjoy it. I want to go home and be alone. Then I go home, see them interacting with other people, then I get envious and sad. 

It's just a very annoying thing to go through, and I don't see how to fix it.

I just moved to another country and I still don't have insurance, plus because of what I am doing, I don't think therapy is a wise thing to go through. For the next year at least, I can't get help.

I'll probably feel better soon, get over it, go back to my old hermit self. But next month, I'll reach another low, then another high (it's really 'median'), then an another low.  




 From depression comes envy, from envy comes depression ... how do you deal with it all? 

Uninteresting life story/rant below. 

Lately, I have been quite envious of seemingly happy people I see. What they have that seem to make them happy are things I will most probably never have: a relationship and friendships.

I don't care for those things actually, but to see so many people seemingly happy from those, kind of make me envious. On top of that, nothing really makes me happy, and the only emotions I get are from looking at these people's lives. And from that envy comes my depression. 

It's currently 1:50 AM, I have to wake up at 6 AM, and I am sitting on my bed, listening to a recording of rain on repeat, and wondering why I was doomed with this shitty personality disorder. Why I was doomed to be boring, asexual, unattractive, you know. All the traits that should keep me away from a relationship. What made me boring, odd, a bit of an outcast. All the traits that should keep me away from friendships. 

Not the greatest night, to be honest. But thank you for reading.  




 There was a similar case of a woman letting her boyfriend use her credit card. They broke up, she wanted her money back. Judge Judy simply said: Too bad, not his problem. (and added, if he were a decent human being he would reimburse her, but legally, the judge doesn't have to force him to do it). However, he seems to acknowledge the need to pay her back, so that would ruin his case. If he acted like it was a gift or the mother allowed him to use the card without reimbursement (which is believable, happens all the time between parents and their children), he would have won. 

Time for me to watch another show.  




 I've been watching Judge Judy on repeat for the past week or so.

He can legally bring his mother to justice if this actually belongs to him. And he most probably will win, since legally, it's his. 




 No it's fine. : )

And I wondering that, too. I read a book a while back about the man who was born in a work camp (Camp 14), and who escaped. Even he went to school, and school was highly enforced in his camp. Of course, it was mostly half day since he had to work in the fields most of his time.

What's odd is that in those camp, or at least in camp 14, they do not talk about Korea 'the country' or the peninsula. They don't teach history, geography ... they don't even mention Kim Jong-Il, his son or his father. I thought maybe they wanted the country to be literate just so they can have everyone read and write about their great leaders, but then I don't see the purpose of schools in camps, especially when most people are there forever.  




 It reminds me of when my dog was a puppy (about 2 pounds) and he fell on his leg, which hurt so much, he cried for a while. While trying to check on him, he bit me and I didn't even move my arm or said anything because I felt like he was terrified enough and there was no way for him to comprehend that I was trying to help him. Fast forward to the present day, I am taking care of a child who tends to bite when he's unhappy (he's learning how to walk and falling on his butt is something he hates, even though his diaper is enough cushion to make it all painless). I respond with a 'no biting' and I move away. I don't feel bad about it, simply because he can understand that I'm not trying to be mean, while I feel like my dog would have thought that I was trying to hurt him. 

I know this is a mild example compared to suffering and death, but still. I think animals are just too innocent, as you said, to know what's happening. 




 Ok, and how often do you actually play the game? 




 You're right. I'm sorry.

Here's the link I fell upon though. At the bottom they quoted the CIA's informations. I didn't notice that the data was 5-6 years old!

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_North_Korea 




 But these types of maps at not just for the pretty colours. It can open up discussions, for instance you can lesrnwquote a lot of history (North Korea) or demography (Portugal) from those maps, especially when each time there is one, a different group of people get to discuss what the map shows, so different type of knowledge is exchanged. 




 It's actually 99%, according to a world fact sheet I believe published by the US government, and when Wikipedia has them as a source, it says 99%.

I wish I could find the page I'm talking about but I'm on mobile 




 I don't know how the 70s were since I'm a 90s kid (⌐■_■)
But maybe it's culture? In South Korea, grown men (and women) kiss kids, boys and girls, and they're not labeled as perverts. I guess the difference is that in Korea, the children I've seen being kissed were 6 and under, and their gender did not matter (and the kiss didn't come with those unnecessary compliments).  




 Why are you acting like someone somewhere knows where they came from? We just know Judaism started somewhere around that area, and nothing is proving the opposite. Unless this was taken from what the traditions say (and it was not), you can pretty much rely on that because trust me, Historians don't just guess out of the blue. If the first synagogue of those Chinese Jews was similar to those of people of that region, or if the traditions (actions or prayers, clothes, whatever) are similar, it's okay to assume they were contacted by them at some point.

We literally cannot know if anything we haven't personally seen is 100% correct, but educated guesses are as good as it gets. Please. 




 It started somewhere un the Middle East, like all three monotheistic religions. I said Israel because that's what tradition says.  




 Usually so called smart people never say they need less work. They actually enjoy doing more in order to fine-tune and master whatever they're learning.  




 One billion dollars. 

I would buy my citizenship (if possible) in France, which would then allow me to live anywhere in the EU. Then of course, if I were to live in France, it would be in Paris. If not, then Hamburg, Germany it is. I would not need a big house. I enjoy small spaces and simple furnishing. IKEA would still be my #1. Then, I'd adopt children. I would pay extra just to make the process quicker (I don't mind the numerous home studies and such, but if there was a way to have my files studied faster, I'd pay for it), and I would adopt at least four children. No nannies or anything, I would do this on my own. Then the rest of my money would be for my children. Obviously, I won't be like "Here. Have 100 dollars and be happy for the day." However I would pay for 'field trips' to the museum or whatever they're into. I would pay for whatever activity they want to do. I would pay for that trip to that place they want to go. I would not let them know that we're extremely fortunate until they're much older, so they wouldn't grow up to be entitled. I would encourage them to make their own money for the frivolous things they want, but still help out if I think they're working hard enough. Then once my children would have graduated school or found a long-term job, I would give them my fortune (split equally between them). I would keep maybe half a million, or whatever I would need to live in a city I love, in a small studio apartment. 

Oh, and I'd buy a Tesla.  




 Honest answer here. 

I would not say I am ugly (not a lost cause), but I am definitely not attractive. I don't really care about it. The few times I got hit on (literally 3 times), I hated it. I flt gross and objectified, I wanted to disappear and forgotten. I have social anxiety so that could be it. I'm glad I am not attractive enough to have it happen often. I would hate life.  




 Haiti whenever it pops up on the news. Lived there most of my childhood. When the earthquake happened, I remembered seeing all those places I used to see on my way to and from school. The worst was the presidential palace, which is still destroyed. I used to love this place because every morning at 7, they play the national anthem, and if you happen to be near it, the men (or the driver? My mother never got out, but she never drove the car herself) of the car had to go out and put his right hand on his heart. This, to me, meant I would be a couple of minutes late to school, and it also usually was when I would practice my acting skills (faking a stomach ache or something to miss a day).  




 Well yeah, of course. Like I said, Judaism either has groups of converted people of the same small region, or people you can historically trace back to Western Asia/The Middle East.  




 Again, not saying all Jewish people came from one couple from 4000+ years ago. I am saying that they did not mix much, meaning the religion stayed within the same race(s). At first, it started with Middle Easterners, then you have converted (a few mixed) Africans, the diaspora that spread throughout Europe, and converted (a few mixed) Asians. And even among those mixed communities, they do not mix very much either. All of this of course is compared to Christians.  




  It is surmised that a small community of Jews, most likely from Persia or India, arrived either overland or by a sea route, and settled in the city, building a synagogue in 1163.

So, some were converted by those Western Asians, or born of one Jewish parent from Western Asia.  




 Wikipedia has a date, but it is based on what their sacred texts say.

It's not hard to believe that Ethiopians were converted. Say Judaism started in modern-day Israel. It is known that the Jewish community then went to Northern Africa (Mediterranean sea), and from Northern Africa (from Egypt), the went a little South. Judaism started roughly 4000 years ago, and apparently, Ethiopian Judaism became a thing some time during the 4th century.  




 But aren't they of the same 'race' as well? I mean, of course it is a diverse race with different communities, kind of like the word 'White' means both Spanish and Lithuanian, despite the differences. 

In Africa, you have the Northern African Jews, who are part of the 'Mediterranean Jewish' community. Then, you have the 'Beta' Jews of Ethiopia and surrounding regions (about 150 000 individuals), then descendants of European Jews who went to South Africa after the war. They don't mix very much, so they still remain the three communities of Jews in Africa. 

As for Eastern Asia, from the little I know, most were converted, or born from one Jewish parent either from Western Asia or Europe.  




 I am American, though I never lived in the US ... but I spent 10 years of my life in Canada before moving to Europe, so I guess that's close enough.

Anyway. I have been in Germany for two months, and I DESPISE how inconvenient it is to live in such a country when you're used to being a lazy bum. For instance, people seldom wear sweatpants here, because it's seen as lazy and you're labeled 'on social services'. Meaning, I have to wear pants. No "messy hairstyles", meaning, it's better to lose your train/bus or wake up earlier than it is to just make a messy bun. Very few pre-prepared food in supermarkets, meaning either cooking or walking to a food place. And inconvenient business times (many places close at 5 pm during the week, and everything is closed on Sundays). Of course, it doesn't bother Germans since most do their shopping before, but my lazy ass would sleep-in on a Saturdays. What do I do now? I actually leave my house on Saturdays. What is this blasphemy?! 

I know most other countries are like Germany. Only Canada and rich parts of Mexico seem to be as lazy-inducing as the US.  




 The thing is African and Asian Jews were relatively recently converted, when European or Middle Eastern Jews have been into that religion form many generations, making it kind of exclusive to those few races.  




 No. Pretty sure they meant just going back into the family tree of jews who were born into that religion, and see that they are all descendants of the same people.  




 Same here. I'm actually terrified of the colour of deep water itself.

One day, [I was looking at a false colour image of the Sun](http://copypast.ru/engine/modules/imagepreview.php?image=http://copypast.ru/uploads/posts/1265760739_sun_stereo_4dec2006_lrg.jpg), and the blue of the background reminded me of deep sea. I still get anxiety from looking at it.  




 I would keep my period tracker just so I can celebrate every time my period would have been due. I would buy red velvet cake, drink strawberry daiquiri and sleep in the nude on my freshly bleached white covers.  




 We're going on a trip **in** our favourite rocket ship, **zooming** through the sky, Little Einsteins.

Please. Respect the artists!  




 One day I farted under my covers.

Never again. That shit gross.  




 Sorry, I was thinking of the wrong thing. My mistake. I meant to say that since they're so low, they're still within the Earth's magnetic field, but that protects them from solar flairs, not radiation.  




 But I don't understand how being in the ISS is comparable to being in actual outer-space. Isn't the ISS located in a relatively secure place? Protected from radiation or anything potentially lethal? And don't we know already know what happens after a prolonged time in 'space'? Why not send people further away? I understand the ISS is the safest place we've got out there, since it's so close, but wouldn't it be more effective to work towards having a mini training and studying (as in, scientific studies) village on the Moon? We have the technology to send people there, that's for sure.  




 Why does whenever a question like this pops up, people act like Reddit is the only good thing about their life? It's really, really sad.  




 Totally agree with you. Period blood is two things: blood + bodily function. Every hates to see at least one of those, so imagine a combination of the two. I think the only bodily fluid I have seen on Instagram was snot from a baby's nose. 

Now, if that was on another website (like Tumblr or Reddit), I would understand the reason why people were getting upset. Those two websites are okay with pretty much anything, so it would seem misogynous to censure such an image. But from Instagram? It's 100% normal.  




 As much as this is dumb, dumber adults will see this and think "Well, they are too young to have fully mastered the art of multitasking behind the wheel! I can do it because I've been driving for 10+ years!"

Adults do this too, unfortunately. But for some reason, it's more okay than if it's a kid.  




 How so? I think it makes the Earth looks like a sphere we're inside of, especially since you can see light from the horizon.  




 Since there is about one total solar eclipse a year, just find a plane and follow the path of the moon's shadow. Sometimes, the path is in the middle of the ocean, down in the South Pole, etc. Other times it's at convenient locations (eve more convenient than this year's). Next year, it will be right on some Malaysian/Indonesian islands, and I believe in 2017, there will be one in mainland USA, so this will be quite possible to see again : ) 




 I think it was done on purpose though.  




 It's very hard to capture stars with (what seems to be) a very basic camera phone.  




 Well, you know the human body unconsciously reacts to things that could be harmful to it by giving you chills or making you feel creeped out or uncomfortable around it. It is why some people get the chills when looking at certain mushrooms, or holes (trypophobia). Your body is telling you "Don't you dare try eating/approaching this." Because that thing is potentially lethal and some of our ancestors learned it the hard way.  




 Or funniest, most interesting, etc. 




 I missed one English class once because I was feeling depressed as fuck. I went to a place that could help me calm down  (and not deal with social interactions, as I have social anxiety as well). The next class, the teacher was kind of harsh to me for missing that day. Guess who never stepped foot in that class ever again. 

Thankfully, my therapist helped me get my failing grade cancelled. To this day I am still extremely thankful. 




 Too many would be to have slept with every humans on Earth. Actually, no. It would be very impressive.  




 My mother is a master at getting compensations, but I think the biggest has to be virtually getting a free smartphone. We were asked to pay it monthly, but due to a mistake (that we could have avoided actually), the company decided to cancel our bill for it.  




 People usually don't know, simply because you look normal. Obviously bad depression makes you look sad and grumpy and tired all the time, but who isn't in High School/College? 

However if your thoughts always involve death, if whenever you go outside you count the many ways you could die "accidentally", or if you start giving up on your responsibilities because you're not afraid of future consequences (meaning, you believe you won't be there to have to fix them), then yes. Those are very obvious signs of wanting to attempt suicide.  




 I don't think it would change much, since most Christians only care about the "Son of God" part. I think Jesus definitely believed to have been important enough to have "God talk to him" and maybe "called him his son". People would just have to accept that he might not have been born from a virgin, executed on the cross, yadiyada (which some Christians see as symbols anyway, and not facts). 

I think the biggest issue would be his race.  




 Growing up in a third world country, I never had tap water. Maybe twice after moving to Canada, and it legitimately gave me stomach aches (despite being healthy). I only drink bottled water or filtered water.  




 Who has been making your smoothies? Either make it home or go to those hipster places where you see them make their food. It's only frozen fruits (and vegetables, sometimes) and water.  




 This reminds me of an episode of American Dad, when Stan gets super excited for his wife's high school reunion because his wife used to be homecoming queen, and he wanted people to know that. The runner-up got fat and stopped caring for her appearance (from depression), and she became Stan's laughingstock. But then a time capsule from prom revealed that the runner-up was actually the winner, and so Stan momentarily leaves his wife and goes on a date with runner-up. Stan was a shitty person for thinking the 'prettiest girl shall be his', even though all this happened 20 years prior.

This post makes you sound like a shitty person for the same reason.  




 Also, they're not "trying too hard", and will not insult you just for the sake of insulting you (despite putting on a show, they don't go overboard with the insults). Ramsay/Cowell will insult your entire family line, then tell you what you did wrong to deserve such insults. While that girl, whatever her name, I don't know what she was trying to do, actually.  




 I'm a fat black girl and I have social anxiety (no sass from me). 

MY GENES FAILED ME!  




 I live in Hannover. Yes, dogs are extremely well-behaved but not the owners. They seldom pick-up after their dog. There's dog poop everywhere. I was walking down my street one day and I saw dog poop on someone's windshield. Not even surprised anymore as I've seen some on walls, windows, in the metro ...  




 Random but my linguistics teacher says it's starting tone universal. I honestly don't understand how she can say such a thing when a country like Canada has two different sign languages, and the BSL and the ASL, which are both English, have different alphabets and signs.  




 Well, you know, around the world, the sounds used by ambulances, fire trucks, etc. change. Maybe they live some place else where it resembles the busy signal.  




 Thank you for this. I'm struggling to be fun, to be honest. I have such a mellow attitude, only very young children can be tricked into believing that I am a fun person. Thank goodness the child I am looking after is one year old. However even with him, I feel like I'm not doing enough. Oh well :/ 




 Eh. This comment makes me feel uncomfortable. My country is an ex slave colony of France, and that was kind of one of the "arguments" from France to remain one of theirs. "Without France, you'd be nothing, ungrateful bastards!" 




 Let's put it this way. It's your first pregnancy, you're carrying twins. Say you live in a country where the time of birth is not noted, so you only know they both came out the same day. Then three years later, you give birth to another child. Is this child your second or your third?  




 I don't think it's a good reason. Japan will not lose their culture if they allow other cultures to immigrate massively into their country. Look at Germany. Their immigration bureaus are booming with new immigrants and refugees every day, yet the stereotypical image of Germany is still present. Still lots of beer and pretzels, still the amazing Christmas markets, still the traditional clothing (for special events), and still the same holidays.  




 Same with the Caribbean. I would like to know what's the average age of my home country, please.   




 The standard Apple alarm tone has given me so much anxiety (chest pain, hyperventilating ... yes, my body is quite dramatic) from hearing it so often in ads that I now use another one. I can't stand this sound.  




 Something I've noticed with myself, I pick up other people's mannerism quite rapidly. I am now living with someone with facial and vocal tics, and apparently, I now have facial tics too that I do control, yes, but I unawarely do them. 

Does it happen to you?  




 Right! And what bothers me the most is when I hear other Black people (I'm black, from the West Indies) who talk down on LGBT people. Not too long ago, we were literally going through the same. I don't understand why the majority of us isn't supportive of them, especially since we can relate on a personal level?? 




 I am living with a wonderful Host Family in Germany. They are a married couple with one young child. From their behaviour, you would guess they're newly weds (sorry for the stereotype), but their relationship is 10+ years old. They're so in love, and loving to their child. 

If it's not for the spontaneous embraces, it's the silly kisses while preparing the baby's milk. If it's not for family time spent trying to get baby to walk from Mom to Dad and back and the congratulatory family hugs, it's the comforting cuddles after a long and exhausting day once baby is asleep. 

We were at the zoo once, and they randomly started hugging and kissing each other (all three). I don't know what triggered it, we were just in front of the hippos with a dozen other people, but it just happened. 

And I thought Germans were reserved (sorry, again, for the stereotype). 

Last night, a depression I have been fighting away creeped back in. Being around so much love feels like a slap in the face. It is as if life is telling me: "Look! Look at what you never got! And look at what you'll probably never have in your life!" 

Here we go again.  




 ALTER FALTER? I'VE BEEN SAYING ALTER VATER FOR THE LONGEST TIME (I'm obviously not a native speaker). 

Thanks!  




 Definitely self-confidence, plus other people (especially mothers!) can feel it, so they worry for the child in question. Especially if you are a man or a young person. They'll think you don't know what you're doing. 




 No, it's not that it is unfair to use *her* as an example. It's dumb to make an example out of the situation. She' was a prime minister who just happens to be a woman. It's the wording. You said it like the UK elected her "to see what could happen" like having a female PM was a test. Then, in the same sentence, you made it sound like said "test" was inconclusive because there were ups and downs, as if that was not a thing with other world leaders, who are mostly men. Basically you made it sound like she was incompetent only because she's a woman. 




 A pillow that was handmade and given to me at birth. I am only 19, but I still have it, and I literally carry it everywhere with me (if I am going to sleep wherever I am heading). It automatically makes any sleeping circumstances comfortable, somehow, despite being pretty small. And it smells comforting.  




 Have you ever tried cracking your knees? Just stand up one day and move your legs inwards without moving your feet, and crack. Best feeling.  




 Mine personally are bad because I produce giant blood cloths on the last two days, and my uterus goes into "baby delivery" mode. It used to be way worse though (fainting, all orifices expelling anything they can find, etc.) so I consider myself lucky for now. I started having my period at the age of 9 and since then, yearly, I talk about it with a doctor, but nothing happened. They all blamed it on my anemia ...  




 Thanks. I very recently learned 'payed' was actually paid (english not my first language). For some reason I'm still adjusting to the news.  




 No really it is a boy. It's [Mason Moon](https://www.google.de/search?q=Mason+Moon client=safari rls=en source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=wxHhVMXEF8OzUcuJhNAG ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ biw=1440 bih=838). A boy. Mason. 

He is now 7 though.  




 It's really weird thinking of children like this. It is as if we were talking about puppies ...  




 But that's a boy.  




 I would recommend going to /r/AskHistorians because not only will you get informative answers, you will get sources backing them up as well!  




 Same. I guess the only change to my life would be calling sleep a "hobby" instead of a "necessity".  




 There is this movie from Quebec, quite a classic, that is titled "Aurore". It is based on the true story of a little girl named Aurore who lived in the early 20th century, I believe. She was recklessly abused by her father and step-mom, who eventually killed her (indirectly, she died as a result of her injuries). No one in the village believed her, despite her obvious injuries. After her death though, everyone felt terrible. The priest felt so guilty for not helping sooner, he ended up committing suicide. It is truly a sad film. The original version is apparently worst, but in the newer version, the abuse and her death are still enough to make you sick. I have never cried so much for a movie.  




 [the xx - Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gxNW2Ulpwk). This version is not the best. Seamless edits are better because the song's tempo doesn't suddenly drop. There was a 10 hour version on YouTube but I think it got deleted. It's a simple enough tune that you can put it in the 'background' of your brain. 

Edit: Found a [better version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4UtBYUMVJk). 2 hours and 45 minutes!  




 Of course, no one is denying the fact that poverty, whatever the race, makes it hard. But there are so many other factors, one being historical oppression which leads to most minorities thinking they are better off getting those easy jobs so they can get money right away, since they are usually poor. As for middle class people becoming poor, I think culture has a lot to do with it but that's a personal opinion. 

Also, if no one in your family went to college, chances are you are not going to go to college either. It was harder for minorities to go to school in past centuries, therefore the number of ancestors who have had a higher education is fewer, so descendants are more likely to follow that path. 

Lastly there is still racism when it comes to employers. I used to live in North America, and it's crazy how people employ others mostly because of their name. In Canada, where I lived, a vietnamese last name guaranteed you a job in the medical industry and plenty of patients, while in America I believe it's an Indian last name. My sister's husband is a doctor in the USA, and during his residency, future residences were chosen based on their name and their picture. The school he went to was mostly full of Indians and Asians, and most chosen residents ended up being Asians and Indians because they chose each other. The same would happen in majorly white university.  




 I think it all started with historical oppression, then culture. Minorities have been set back for so long that it is harder for them to reach the top, which could then lead to an overall feeling of helplessness, which then leads to some minorities feeling like effort is not even worth it anymore.  




 I am assuming you are a man or a woman who never looked into it, but a hysterectomy is not an easy procedure to get done. At least not in North America. Usually doctors refuse to give it to young women (so, under the age of 35), especially if they are childless. "You might change your mind!" is their excuse. As for birth control, they do not always stop or lessen your blood flow. They do not always get rid of the pain. They do not always control your mood. And for some women, it's just not something they're willing to pay for. 




 I read somewhere that in four countries including South Korea, women get a day or two off per month because of their menstrual cycle. Payed or not, I would totally be okay with that. I rather die every month comfortably in my house than in some dirty public restroom.  




 I agree! But I read somewhere that you cannot (legally) start the process before the age of 16.  




 I agree. Some people have good hearts *only* because religion says so. So we better let them believe in whatever they believe in. 




 She is other people's best friend. Why can't I be special?! 




 Everything but food. If I were to housesit for the Royal Family, I would leave everything intact, even if there was an open chamber with cash in it, but I would take the food.  




 Same here. When I was in High School, I even noticed they would treat you differently depending on the High School you went to (based on your uniform, or lack thereof). My friends and I were never really followed or asked to leave our bags at the front because our school was known for having "good catholic and studious girls", but kids from nearby schools that were labeled as ghetto were often followed or even asked to leave.  




 By being an au-pair, I not only wanted to take care of a child as a live-in caregiver and live overseas, I also wanted to use it as an excuse to force myself to develop my social skills. See, I have a personality disorder that interferes and therefore completely messes up my social behaviour. I look like a 'loner', a 'no life', and these are actual comments coming from psychologists who have spoken to me about it! Said personality disorder is obviously not treatable, but people with it can have pretty good lives. However they are all hermits, and thrive more when alone. 

I boarded the plane to Germany, saying to myself that if I must fake those social skills and it makes me physically ill, I will (and it has been making me sick). But despite what I think were great efforts, no conclusive results. I am still the same as I was before this journey. 

I personally don't care about how good or bad my social skills are, but I do owe it to this family to be the best person I can be. They are so nice to me. So caring and they trust me a lot. I just want to be a pleasant person to be around, for them. I want them to be happy with the decision they took. Really, they deserve so much and being pleasant is the least I can give them. 

But I am scared of them giving up on me. They have not shown any signs of disdain or anything, but I know I am not the best person to be around. If they don't like me, they totally should look for someone who is more compatible, I think. On the other hand, I enjoy their company! But it's not about me only. I don't want to disappoint them and I just don't know what to do to be the kind of the person they would appreciate. I am so disappointed in myself. Please help. 




 Or, are you incapable of missing people? In French, we sometimes say "Loin des yeux, loin du coeur", meaning (literally) far from the eyes, far from the heart. Pretty accurate way of describing the situation. 

I have been living away from my family for three days and I have to remind myself that they even exist. The moment they were out of my sight, I forgot about them. Prior to moving, I spent a month away from my mother and dog, and I thought I would at least miss my dog but ... nothing. Forgot I had one, and it was strange to come back and have him around. 

Anyone like that?  




 Pizza can fill you up with just once slice, depending on the crust and what's on it. So maybe they wanted to make it last. 




 I think people like this are bragging about the fact that they managed to graduate high school without reading books, and not so much bragging about not reading books at all.  




 She would be really popular in /r/cringepics . Just a bunch of people bullying others for their social faux pas, when very often, it's people who very obviously don't know how to approach others (not their fault).  




 Yeah I'm sorry I did. Obviously not all. But unfortunately again, we can only hear the loudest.  




 With the Black History Month in full swing, I think I need to address this.

There is a difference between being African and being African descendants. 

"Duh!" you might think. Well, no. 

See, I am Haitian (ethnicity, and I lived there for the first few years of my life). I am not nationalist at all, but I do appreciate it when they show a picture of a Haitian person and they say "Hey, here is a Haitian guy/gal who did good."

I go on Facebook, this "Black pride" page posts a picture of Toussaint Louverture, a Haitian man who started the revolution that led to Haiti's independence. Great! Thanks for mentioning the guy, but why is he called "African leader"? This man was born and raised in the territory we call Haiti today, and he personally considered himself French. Haiti has been its own thing as a territory since late 17th century ... why are we still called Africans? 

Our roots are Africans, and to be honest I get all happy thinking my ancestors may have been from Ghana (I love this country). But from the 17th, 18th century, my ancestors have been born and raise in a new location, with a totally different culture and name. We were influenced by the Europeans and the Natives as well. We were on our own, with no real ties left between Africa and said new location. We were French from Saint-Domingue, then just a few years later, Haitians. First independent Black nation in the world, and the second oldest nation in America! 

Why now, should Haitians hide under the "African" pride, when really it's Black pride first, and Haitian pride second? We are not Africans. From very early on, we had this established. Haiti's first "head of state" considered himself French, and so did many other people of Saint-Domingue. Because Saint-Domingue was a colony then, a colony of the French. And later, thanks to Napoleon really (though that's not what he wanted), a sense of nationalism was revived and we became Haiti. Can't we, at least, be called Haitians? For once? Pretty please? 

Now I'm saying this on the page, and people are saying I must not be Black to say something like that. Because I know my history? Others are saying I'm brainwashed. Because I know my history? Lastly, icing on the cake, I was called stupid. BECAUSE I KNOW MY HISTORY? 

Very few of those people were Haitians, and all were living in the United States. Nothing against the States but lately, it's like Black Americans like discrediting everything that is not directly African. I think, honestly, it's because Black-Americans were not "allowed" to have a proper identity, so they go back seeking comfort and an identity from the Motherland. Which is understandable, but not all Black persons feel this need. 
 




 Literally anything in relation to health or appearance. You can google "beauty mark" and you'll find atrocious growth the size of footballs on the back of small children. It's always the same thing, whatever you're looking for.  




 Thank you! I will start doing this now.  




 Thank you for the comment! Actually, I was told not to ask too many question. I don't do it well. I sound like an interviewer, so I try not to ask too much. 




 In some countries, homosexuality is so out of the question, friends can look more affectionate than most couples from Westernized countries do. South Korea has this thing called skinship (I think Japan too), and it's basically all about being very touchy, usually amongst friends. Taking the metro in Seoul was quite the adventure for my very closed-minded father.
