 You're not weak.  You're just human.

Give it time.  But seriously, control what you can in order to heal faster.  i.e. don't go browsing his social media.  You'll only delay your progress. 




 When are you applying?  This fall or Fall 2014? 




 Depends on your profile (current job, undergraduate major, etc)honestly.  Your GMAT score is awesome, your GPA is actually higher than mine by a little so to hear you say its low is hilarious.

But a 3.2 in Engineering looks much better than one in Theater. 




 He's still in the "honeymoon phase."  He's probably not in love for real.  Pretty soon the allure will wear off.

More importantly, you have to be strong and not worry about what he is doing.  It sucks but all you can do is try to remove all memories, fill your time with things you enjoy, and move on. 




 I'm in the same situation.  Long arms are great for basketball for terrible for suit buying. 




 No prob.  I'm glad other people benefited from it.   




 I agree.  Every situation is different.  But I guess my post is assuming that you've done all you could to make it work but they still don't want to be with you.

I see that situation all the time on here and people are lost and don't know  what to do.  So they come on here and wonder how they can get their ex back because they've become so dependent on them and the thought of being without them is too much.

I'm just offering another way to look at the situation. 




 I wrote this in my journal as a reminder to myself.  Maybe it helps you guys:


**So you want to get her back huh?  (A conversation with myself)**


So you want her back huh?  You guys have spent 7 years together and she is the love of your life.  She is highly compatible with you and it feels like life situations are the only reasons you’re not together…



Hold your horses.  **You want to know how to get your ex back?  It’s simple.  MOVE ON.**  Assume you’re not going to get her back and live your life.  Be happy.  I know at first you thought that if she saw how miserable you were then she’d want you back.  *This is a horrible strategy.  All that does is create pity and guilt.*  It doesn't make someone want to BE with you however.  The same things that made you attractive in the first place are going to be the same things that would win an ex back.  If you’re happy and living your life you will be attractive.  

It’s basic laws of attraction here.  Think about it, if the roles were reversed.  Has seeing someone sad and upset made you like them more?  No.  Actually, hell no.  Even if you feel bad you still don’t want anything serious with that person.  People like other people who enhance their life, not bring them down.  But if the situation were the opposite and you saw an ex happy and having the time of their life without you, you instantly want them back in some way shape or form.

  
The irony of all this is that when you’re on that journey you completely forget about trying to win the other person back.  You’re genuinely experiencing happiness.  Things get to the point where you don’t even know if you’d want to go back down that path with your ex. 




 Story of my life brah.  I'm a successful engineer who has went way farther than he ever imagined.  Now I sit at my desk and ponder what's next.  That's the problem with goal chasing... You're never satisfied.  I tried to impart this wisdom on my ex girlfriend who is grinding for her PhD at the moment.  I told her that once its all over and she has a job, she'll understand what I'm going through.

What sucks even more is that you can't complain about it because people won't understand and will say you need to be grateful for what you have. 




 What subreddit are you referring to?  I'd like to see the before and after shots as well. 




 I'm stealing this tactic.  It may prove useful in the future. 




 sauce?!?!? 




 As someone who has been there before and held on way too long, I implore you to find SOMETHING... ANYTHING... to put your mind and energy to.  

Whatever it is you've always wanted to do, put your time into that.  Ever wanted to learn the guitar?  Go for it.  Ever wanted to learn how to code?  Well now all you have it time.

Trust me, it's the only way.  Because the only thing that's going to help is time and you might as well use the remaining time you have as efficiently as possible.  You MUST do this because the alternative is you could look up and still be miserable 2 years from now.

It's going to be tough but stay strong.  Eventually she'll be just a memory and it will be hard to feel any emotions about the situation. 




 I sat here for awhile looking for words of encouragement to tell you but honestly I know how that feels and nothing anyone told me would erase the pain.

So, I hope you get better.  Just know that you'll always have this community to vent to when you need it.  It does help to know that others have went through similar situations. 




 I remember doing this and getting yelled out.  "Why would you want to remind me of that?"  was her response.  LOL.

I'd say don't do it but you're probably going to do it anyway. 




 I had a 7 year relationship go awry when I was 27.  Have been spending the past two years trying to move on.  So yeah it sucks, at age 29 having to pick up the pieces again.  It's not the end of the world though.

Although I wish I could have seen it coming earlier and been settled in a new relationship by now heading towards marriage (maybe) 




 Sounds like an excuse to leave in my opinion.   




 I've been thinking about this alot.  Sometimes I can listen to a song about a breakup and smile knowing that others have went through the same thing.  Other times it just makes me sadder.

What do you guys think?

I kind of want to watch *Swingers* and *500 Days of Summer* again for some perspective but I'm scared it will make me really sad.  when I first saw them I hadn't experienced heartbreak so I could relate. 




 The first cut is the deepest... 




 I wish I could have read this two years ago.  (Ah, who am I kidding?  I still would have ignored the advice)

Good stuff tho! 




 Whoa, just let me say that I completely feel for you.  Me and my ex of seven years broke up when I was 28.  After all the ups and downs it was just over.

Like you she was my first 'serious' relationship and the first female I truly loved.  I wouldn't wish that kind of heartbreak on ANYBODY.  It's been almost two years and we're still cool but it still hurts.  I've had a girlfriend since then but I wasn't ready so I ended it.

All I can say is that you gotta try to do what you can to stay focused and give yourself time to heal.  The late breakups suck because by this point in your life you're thinking marriage and a family.  To have the person that you had in mind for that end it with you is a huge shock to your life.  Honestly, when I read posts from 18-22 year olds on here I can't help but chuckle.  They have so much life ahead of them and are way too young to be worried about it.  But I've also learned that getting your heart broken is HARD no matter how old you are.  Like they say, the first cut is the deepest.

I feel like I'm rambling but even though i'm only a couple years younger than you, understand that time heals everything and you STILL have time.  If you have a good circle of friends you can count on that will speed up the process.  I didn't have that.  Most of my friends went through this years ago and are married or heading towards it.  Reading articles and reddit posts with other people's experience helped me a lot.  PM me if you want to talk more.  




 This is good basic advice. That's what makes me so sad about my ex, she went from always being available to being consumed with her phd then breaking up with me. We're cool and tried to be friends since we were together for 7 years but I keep getting my feelings hurt because she's terrible at making the time to be a good friend. I told myself I'd wait until she graduates this year but I'm already pulling away.  




 I disagree with this. He has plenty to lose. Take it from me, I'm 29 and I can relate from having a 7 year relationship ended. Every time I break NC and reach out, I feel worse than before. Like he said it's selfish for him to contact her because he feels bad. She probably felt worse. Contacting her will probably only anger her and have him feeling worse. Best thing to do is move on and get over your oneitis. It's tough, especially at this age since it's the time when you feel like settling down.  




 Wow this is all too real.  Especially reason #1.  People will say you're jaded though.  I appreciate this discourse.  Thanks! 




 Understood.  But be honest, does part of you feel like your ex is preventing you from giving someone new a chance?  I feel like I'm doing this sometimes.  Whether consciously or subconsciously. 




 *bro hugs* 




 I tried therapy during the time I was on medication.  I went to a few sessions.  The jury is still out on whether it helped or not.  She gave me some good books and dvds though.  I'd continue to do therapy if it wasn't so expensive.  I get just as much from having a deep conversation with a good friend.  I miss my friends.  :( 




 Wow.  This is exactly what happened with me.  But trust me, you will have a day when you get angry and resent her for it.  You will have a day where you say, *"Why couldn't you stay together and accomplish your dream?  Why wouldn't you let me be your rock as you go through this process?"*  Truthfully, everybody needs support when they embark on a tough journey. 




 Holy shit!  Four years?!?!  People tell me I'm crazy for not moving on after TWO.  Stay strong my friend! 




 How do you get started with Cognitive Therapy?  Do you need to see a professional? 




 What you're saying makes a lot of sense.  I think I don't need medication because I'm not severely depressed or suicidal.  I still have my bouts but I was fine for the most part after withdrawing.  It's only an issue now because I've went through a major heartbreak and its sending me into episodes more than normal.  I don't want to do meds but if things get worse I may have to.  Being dependent on meds is my biggest fear though.  :( 




 I'm only speaking from my experience.  My doctor wasn't open to me trying alternative methods.  I tried Prozac for awhile (combined with Klonopin to help me sleep) and the results weren't good.  His solution was to keep taking it.  That's when I stopped trusting him. 




 That's awesome.  What does it look like during regular use? 




 Thanks.  I've taken GABA and 5-HTP as well for a boost.  I have a bottle of St. Johns Wort taht I never opened.

How is light therapy working for you?  I think I have SAD 




 Even if he doesn't want to talk you should say something to at least get it off your chest.

Oh and plan an exit strategy 




 I think it going away depends on a variety of factors.  My relationship with my ex-gf lasted 7 years so it's tougher for me to move on.

Sure we can talk more if you want.  Its therapeutic.  Maybe we can help each other. 




 I'll give it a try. 




 The past keeps haunting me.  Every little thing is a reminder of the *good* times.  But surely it wasn't always good?  

Why does our brain do that to us?  :(

It's been almost two years and I can't even remember why we ever argued. 




 My tips...

1. Work on getting yourself together before you even entertain her.
1. Occupy your time and mind with other things.
1. Go out and meet new people.  Make new friends.
1. Ask yourself, if she really wanted to be with you would she be doing this?
1. Give it time.

You may want to not talk to her either.  I suggest NC because keeping in touch with her is only going to prolong your suffering.  Based off what you typed, she doesn't seem real considerate.  It's natural for you to think about her.  You're going to have your down moments.  You guys were a major part of each other's past, but that doesn't mean you have to be a part of each other's future. 




 Where's the 5th starter? 




 Usually I do good.  I'd say at least 70% of the time.  The other 30% of the time my scumbag brain plays games with me.

It doesn't take much to remind me of my ex.  It could be as simple as driving by a Target and thinking, "She loved to shop there."

I wish I had that device from Men In Black that erased that part of my memory so I could live life fully without constantly being reminded of my failure. 




 Oh I totally agree.  I'm just speaking on what usually happens.  




 It's the right choice but it will eat at you for AWHILE.  Trust me, I'm going through it now.  But in the long run you'll be glad you walked away and spared them future pain. 




 Ah... good ol' NC.  I'm torn on if it works or not.  It's definitely for you and not the other person.



I've been NC by someone before for years and didn't even notice it.  This person still contacts me from time to time and still can't let go.  So in this case I'd say it's not working.

Another ex went to the extreme and blocked me from everything and pretended like I never existed.  She seems happy but when someone brings me up or she gets a reminder I think she comes crashing down.  Maybe it will work for her.

Lastly, I've tried it with the love of my life and I just couldn't do it.  Most I ever lasted was 10 days.  But every time we talked and I got some stuff off my chest I felt better.  What I wound up doing was a progressional NC that went from us talking daily to weekly and me blocking her on twitter and gchat.  Not having everyday reminders of her definitely helped in my ability to move on in life but I still haven't 100% let go.  I'm working on it tho.

**TL;DR:  NC may not work and won't make sense in every situation.  Use your best judgment.**  




 Completely agree.  I ask people what they're thinking about and they respond, "Nothing."


I'm like how can you possibly not think about anything?!?!  The concept blows my mind.  Ignorance is bliss. 




 Your relationship wasn't perfect.  Your perception of the relationship was perfect.  These new found developments have shaken your perception of the relationship and you don't want to come to terms with reality.

"When people show you who they really are you should believe them"


I apologize if any of that was harsh.  But to be honest, as a man, I've been on the other side of this.  If you're really a good gf he'll regret it and come crawling right back. 




 Story of my life breh.  Sadly it's a blessing AND a curse.  My over analyzing makes me a great engineer but its terrible in other aspects of life. 




 Calms me down and relaxes me honestly.  Luckily I don't have addictive tendencies. 




 I thought this dude was saying "You're going to die alone." and thought to myself, wow what a depressing track to study to.

But he says "Before I die alone" 




 I haven't seen any online either.  I checked all types of blazers and they were all regular.
