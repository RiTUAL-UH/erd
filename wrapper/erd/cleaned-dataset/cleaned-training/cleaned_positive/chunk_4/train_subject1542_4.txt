 this is awesome 




 thank you so much for this... hopefully they dont catch on 




 genius 




 mood, self esteem, appearance. i have a naturally pretty large frame. 6'0. even when im not working out and eating pretty little, i drop down to 170 pounds which i think is pretty heavy for someone without much fat or muscle. i feel pretty ashamed if im out playing sports and im not strong or athletic. 

also in the working world. when guys wear their dress shirts and tuck. if you got belly or muffin top, or your ass is sticking out of your slacks or your legs arent firm, even the nicest people cant help but treat you a TINY bit different. if you look good, you perform good, you feel good 




 math 




 these videos used to piss me off, but now i find it satisfying to see him get beat 




 popcorn...

ice cream...

chips... 




 all my major muscle groups have gotten bigger. deltoids and back saw the most growth though. also my abs push out now, not as defined as i want yet, but the abdominal muscles have definitely gotten bigger. been 2 months of lifting for me too. "newbie gains" 




 ex machina 




 LOL 




 oh definitely. im sure in the heat of the game, once they lose their cool, they arent thinking straight and arent considering slowmo replays/ refs watching. 

also none of these plays are actually my favorite, if anything im poking fun at how stupid some of this is. i think any play that isn't a "basketball play" and can cause injury is really really stupid and could damage or even end another players career 




 oh was that last year? hahaha 




 darn missed that one
 




 everything works out in the end 




 burritos 




 hahaha i do that when im checking for acne or food stuck in my teeth. looks like im trying to get a good angle for a selfie...
