 I found out that he was just using me to make my best friend jealous. she had rejected him just before he asked me out but didnt tell me about it until I had been with him for almost 6 months. when I asked him about it he just started going into an all caps rage and brought up a lot of painful memories from my past, calling me a worthless whore and telling me that I deserved everything that happened to me as a kid.  




 My best friend finally got to visit for the first time since she moved out of state. she is spending the week with me before heading off to see her family. she is practically my sister and its been hard since she moved away, so im really thankful for the time we have together.  




 my cat seems to have a taste in music. she purrs and acts all sweet when I play foo fighters, soundgarden, and nirvana, but she becomes all aggressive when my sister starts playing taylor swift or katy perry. does this happen to anyone else?  




 I have a lot of people I need to prove wrong.
