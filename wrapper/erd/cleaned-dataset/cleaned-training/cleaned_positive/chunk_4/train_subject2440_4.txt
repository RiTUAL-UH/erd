 Much of what you expressed here is explained very well by the Jungian concept of [Shadow Self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_%28psychology%29). It's very normal and understanding it can put you in control of it.

If the Wikipedia article makes any sense don't stop there. There is a wealth of information on the web about Jungian psychology and the Shadow Self. 




 Great advise. I'm 57, wasn't diagnosed until my mid-30s and am highly allergic to SSRIs, the go-to family of meds that are known to work for most depressions. We still haven't found a med that can help me but SSRIs will help 90+% of the people who need them. 

Depression worsened for me with age. So if I must suffer so greatly what is the point of living? Only to advise and encourage others through my knowledge and experience.

As you so wisely put it,

Don't leave it until it's too late. Nothing is going to change unless you make it. 

People at risk need to be continually encouraged to endure until an effective treatment is found. On one hand we want and are taught to be strong and "pull ourselves up" but on the other hand, if anybody had ever looked me in the eyes and told me, "This is a life-long, life-threatening problem for you that you cannot ignore," I might have listened. No one told me.

Like you, I was permitted to abandon my treatment time and time again. The mental health bureaucrats can only do so much. Their job is to help in a clinical setting. But outside of that setting it is up to people like you and I to try to make a difference for people at risk through our encouragement.

The only thing left for me is to try to encourage others to avoid the mistakes that I have made and I've succeeded in a few cases I think and there is satisfaction and gratification that.
