 That's why I said maybe 




 I was just wondering what would happen if an angel and a demon had a child never said that's what was happening in the show that's why I used the words "what if" and "maybe"just some outside the box thinking that's all. 





























 Why do I feel alone even when surrounded by family and friends? I have been diagnosed with sever depression and anxiety but honestly who hasn't these days.i feel like I have no one I feel like my friends just talk to me to be nice but honestly they could care less and I know I love my family and they love me but damn, I just feel emotionless and alone. 



















 Somedays are good some are not...I feel like a complete failure to my family I can't even do school right I can't even start my day right I feel like anything I do is wrong and I feel alone sure I have people I talk to at school that call me their friend but I still feel alone I have no one close no one to share this with and it eats me up inside, I'm 16 and my life feels like a huge mistake like it was never meant to be I'm only 16 why me why ?
I just want to feel happy I just want this to stop I just want to feel normal again I want to have a day where I don't feel like a total screwup, at my school i put on the mask of a kid who cares for others but on the inside I don't care for myself sure I might have a smile all day but it's not real and frankly I'm to good at it.
