 Thank you for the lovely comment! It is daunting at first, but the blogging community really is a wonderful friendly and supportive environment. Just take it one day at a time and you'll learn along the way :) - if you want any help let me know xx 




 Hey all :) I have suffered with some serious mental health issues including self harm, bulimia, [suicide attempts](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/i-survived/) and general depression and anxiety.

A few years ago I decided I no longer wanted to be a victim of my mind - of my experiences - and so I started using [various tools and techniques](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com/category/intrusiveobsessive-thoughts-and-rumination/how-to-get-rid-of-intrusive-or-obsessive-thoughts) to start [taking back control](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com/category/quietening-the-mind) of my life. 

I also started telling people my story. It was amazing to me how many people would open up about their experiences once they saw how open I was about mine. I learned very quickly that nearly everyone has a connection with mental health, be it personally, with a friend or with a family member

3 months ago I launched my blog [The Unmarked Road](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com), in an attempt to continue to speak openly about my experiences, and to give hope and strength to those struggling in the way that I did.

I want people to stop feeling ashamed over their difficult emotions and to realise the inner power that they have within them to change what can sometimes feel like an inevitable future; a future dominated by mental illness and a lack of control over their destiny.

I would love for people to visit my site (of course :) ) but more than that I would love you to have a look and see how [my blog](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com) could be improved. How together we can take on the stigma that still surrounds mental illness.

Thank you for taking the time to have a look.

Dani xx
