 Hi there, the last drug I was doing was heroin. I was sick of being miserable and not having money and constantly having to steal and live a life in fear of being arrested. I went to alot of detoxes and rehabs and eventually I gave up trying to run I went through the steps had a year and a half sobriety than I relapsed. I realized the drug wouldn't change anything in my life. I still struggle here and there I have weeks where I feel like shit. But having a crappy day sober is way better than having any day high or drunk for me. I'm 23 and only have my family by my side and a job. I realize I have a problem and its two choices live clean and sober and try to enjoy life. Or use or drink and watch me destroy myself and take my family down while I do it. Oh and I did blow too. Honestly man it isn't easy. Read some books on addiction or living a life finding meaning it will help.  




 Your mind is still running on the fact you can use drugs and alcohol. Yes you have relapsed my friend. Go to a meeting or find a sponsor.  




 I started using drugs early when I was around 14. I am 23 years old today. I've used all sorts of drugs. I am a addict in nature. If you need to help a loved one or anything at all ask away. 




 Thank you.
