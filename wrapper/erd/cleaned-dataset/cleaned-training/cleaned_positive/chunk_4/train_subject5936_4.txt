 A woman is someone who tells me that they are a woman. You don't 'need' a qualification to be a woman e.g. genitalia, clothes, make-up, long hair. It doesn't matter if your trans, genderfliud, cis or what. You don't need a certain trait to 'qualify' you as a woman.
Gender is just an easy way for cis-people to show their sex and hence their secondary characteristics. Presenting as one sex or another, I think, is supposed to indicate what genitalia you have but it's a flawed system. Because now we know, the traits one associates with gender don't necessarily equate to sex.

In summary: it doesn't matter what society thinks because society is a mish-mash of the thoughts and ideas of people that lived a long time ago, who don't know the things we do now and have the same experiences.
If you want to be called a woman, I will call you 'she' and treat you like anyone else. You are the only person who will live with you for your entire life and you know yourself best. Frankly, I think transpeople are some of the most amazing individuals around. GET 'EM GIRL!!!
