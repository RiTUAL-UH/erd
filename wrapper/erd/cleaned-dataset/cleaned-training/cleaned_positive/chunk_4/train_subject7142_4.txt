 I smoke both and it seems to help me. Not in a life-changing way but it gets things going and somehow relieves anxiety ! 




 Yeah I'm doing the same thing,I want to end it everyday but then I think of my family and it's not fair to me to make them suffer just to be relieved.

I keep myself busy and alone, I try to avoid others not to see what my life is missing through them. It's not the healthiest but it's better than nothing,I guess. 




 Somehow the fact that he doesn't have hope for this specifically is good,because there's barely anything worst in that kinda situation than hoping for the loved one to come back through some kind of miracle or something.
If you know about some dream or goal in life he used to have before this happened,maybe it would help him to bring it up. He won't want to do it now and will probs think it's full of shit,but one of my online friends did that a couple of times and after the whole " you gotta be shitting me I can't do that there's no way I could and I don't want to anyways" thing it did spark the thought that there might be something left in this world.

Thank you for the internet hugs,I appreciate it ! 




 This so much. I used to have lies-free friends but how can I feel fucking close to someone who's gonna come up to me and tell me how wonderful their life/weekend/holiday was in details then ask me 'bout mine knowing it will be jokes on my tired ass self if I come up with the truth or if they suspect it. That or they get angry in a " shut the fuck up about being lonely you don't even want to go to clubs or hang out you're just asking for it" way. As if it was this fucking easy,smh.

I don't get it either man,I'm done with this bullshit.
