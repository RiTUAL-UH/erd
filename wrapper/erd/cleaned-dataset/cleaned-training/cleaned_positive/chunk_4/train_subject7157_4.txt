 I agree with ckb2. Please get help. 




 Oooh... I think there's money burning a hole in my wallet... because now I want to buy more lol -stalks at Ulta to find the HD blush- 




 Wow, love the look!! 




 What is the best, safe way to remove nails at home?  I just would like to see my natural nails again.  I haven't seen them for a couple of months and they're really growing long so, I just would like to admire them and finally is able to paint nail polish on my nails rather than using fake nails... 




 But I am willing to travel. I like traveling as well. 




 Yes, thank you 




 Yes, I'm in Rochester, NY. 




 I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask.  I was wondering if there are beauty/makeup conventions I can go to?? 




 I really wish I did a better research before starting my own channel but then a come a few videos later, I realized I needed to do better.  So here I am, trying to fix and improve my channel.

Great advices, I will keep this in mind.  I'm also brand new to YouTube as well so whoohoo, good luck to us!!
