 Thank you for your answer.

I don't think he'd ramp up threats if I leave. From all I know I'd expect him to thank me for letting him finally die. It is what he desired for years... I don't know how long planning and getting the "courage" (I feel it is the right and wrong word for this) to do it would take him. Maybe a week, maybe even a few months. 

I thought about getting a therapist for some twisted sort of "supervision"... Who I could ask what to do about certain things... though I don't think I could still influence him if we separated. And everything I said would only be from my subjective view... not easy for a therapist to help someone by proxy I guess...

But if I understood you right you meant to totally cut ties with him?

I feel like this goes against my nature (eventhough I thought of it and wanted to do it quite a few times). It would be the equivalent of stopping CPR on a patient who still has a chance of survival.... Of course CPR is exhausting over time, but  

 who am I to prioritize my own wellbeing over the life of someone?

Most people in this thread are suggesting that I should just walk away and let him die... I don't know if I can do that... I am only 20 and about to kill someone by denial of assistance. While spending all my time on learning how to save people... 

I just want to do the right thing. What is right for him, his friends and his family. I, myself am not the patient, I won't kill myself no matter what he does or if he dies, I'll spend my life helping people no matter if I am happy or sad... Because "I" doesn't exist, it does not matter.
