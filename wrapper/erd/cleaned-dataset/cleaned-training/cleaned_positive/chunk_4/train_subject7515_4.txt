 I'm not reddit but I like the way this one thinks ^ 




 I was expecting Papal lasers and I was sorely disappointed  




 So if my well runs dry and water is a human right, how would that be provided to me? Would the local government have to pay to relocate me to a site with a viable ground water source, or supply me somehow? 




 Wait... The antichrist? Like, offspring of a human and a cabrion demon, revelations style antichrist?

Is this like a common belief among baptists or just a select fringe group? 




 At least Catholics standardize what you eat. My church just used bread (no crust because Jesus doesn't do crust). The one week they ran out of wheat halfway through and switched to rye. Result: you had your choice between white meat Jesus and darkness Jesus.
