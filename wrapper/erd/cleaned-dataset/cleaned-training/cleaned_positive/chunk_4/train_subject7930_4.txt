 This one time, I was finishing my Coke at a restaurant. I pulled out the straw when I was done and saw this giant dead hairy yellow spider somehow clinging onto the tip of the other end in a way that could only mean that it had been stuck there the whole time. I had been drinking all that Coke that was washing over its dead spider carcass.
I will never drink out of a straw ever again without checking both ends. 




 I went to a French immersion middle school and we had this one particular teacher that stuck out. We called him Monsieur Sohier and he had this reputation with students for resembling something like an angry leprechaun (pointed ears, grizzled facial hair, balding). Whenever it seemed like we weren't paying enough attention, he'd actually scream at us for being horrible students until he got red in the face. And then he'd straight up throw things like chalkboard erasers or textbooks across the room, aimed at specific students whenever they talked in class. This one time, he walked up to a particularly talkative classmate and calmly pointed out this dictionary sitting on the shelf. He then stated in French something along the lines of, "If I were to hit you full-force with this dictionary, you'd probably drop dead before even knowing it."

To be honest, I'm surprised he never had an aneurysm in all his years of teaching. 




 I know some people who are very averse to sad music. I know for me, listening to extremely depressing music is a peculiar kind of catharsis. I hope you feel better soon. (: 




 Depends if you really like extremely depressing songs. I compiled the ultimate playlist of the most depressing breakup music I could find when I was going through a particularly rough one.

 I lost as soon as pelvic thrust guy started squeaking his way into frame.

 I'm 5'3" (actually more like 5' 2.75"). I think that's considered a pretty decent height for an Asian girl. I still wish I was taller though. It's kind of sad when I need to ask for help because I can't reach the shelves at work. 




 I spent a good portion of my high school years trying to dress like a [gothic lolita](http://lolitachan.org/scbt/src/130109239385.jpg). Nnnergh, whyyyy?

also, [slap bracelets](http://slapbraceletsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/slap_bracelets_pile.jpg). 




 Agnes. I'm not quite sure if I like it or not. It makes me feel like a crotchety old lady. I've also had people mistake it for "Haggis". 




 Getting distracted by your own cleavage all the time. :D
