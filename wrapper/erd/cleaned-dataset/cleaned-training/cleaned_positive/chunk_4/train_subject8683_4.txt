 And when did I ever say that Russell is the undisputed GOAT? 




 You're basically saying that since everyone, ostensibly, doesn't totally agree on subjective measurements, you can't argue one player as the GOAT.

That's the POINT OF A DEBATE. One person has his subjective argument, and another has his subjective argument, and you TRY TO PROVE THAT YOURS MAKES MORE SENSE.

It's what the concept of debating is BASED ON. 




  You can argue Russell is the most dominate player over his peers if you want, but **no one can look at a game from the 60s and one from the 90s and say they are the same.**

And no one has said they are. The point is that Bill Russell did things no one else has done. Yes, his competition was weaker, but he accomplished a whole lot more than anyone else ever has.

That's like if I play NBA 2K14 on Rookie and score 1,000 points in one game with one player. You can use the "It's Rookie mode, too easy, only reason you did that" argument if you want, but 1,000 points with one player is amazing, period. 




 Why does a player have to be overwhelmingly better than the next-best player to be the GOAT?

Once again, you believe in that logic, and that's fine, but that doesn't make it 100% fact. 




 Kinda like it's important to recognize how you think you know everything when you don't, much less something personal about a person you don't know at all? 




 http://sidoxia.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/pot-kettle-black.jpg?w=455 




 The fact that you believe in this logic doesn't make it infallible. 




 Wonderful.

Should I just give up on trying to have a reasonable discussion? 




 Not sure what the hostility is for. Chill out.

Anyway...

 There is no objective determination of how to value these things.

Then how do we know who's better than who in any era? Also, at least half those statistics suck and are unreliable/fallacious. 




  it's impossible to compare him to the modern era to the variety of rule changes and fundamental play style differences.

It really isn't, though. Not if you know enough about basketball.

You can look at stats, video, his performances against the best players/teams (single-handedly kept Wilt below his average in 100+ career matchups), etc.

For God's sake, the man was VOTED BY THE NBA as the greatest player of all time in the 80s. 




  Video and stats of the games don't exist or aren't recoverable

They do. There's plenty of video, and professional historians have researched and recorded advanced statistics for Russell's era. That's how we know how great his defensive impact was-- the Celtics' team Defensive Rating skyrocketed as soon as he came to the team, and fell off a cliff the minute he retired.

 there's no objective means of weighing statistics.

Why not? All you have to do is look at what the rest of the league was doing, and how that player performed relative to the average. As long as you have enough knowledge to properly account for any extenuating circumstances, it shouldn't be a problem. 




 Wow, the downvotes.

Note to self: Unpopular opinions are against the rules, no matter how logical. 




  You have to take into account positional differences, the players they played against, and even things like referee playcalling differences. It really isn't possible.

What exactly makes this impossible...? 




  I think it's hard to judge Russell because of his era, and the fact that his team was loaded with HOFers during an time with few NBA teams.

Those players were Hall-of-Famers due to Russell. Look at their statistics, research them, watch them play, and tell me with a straight face that Russell had an All-Star team around him.

 Jordan is just easier to compare, because the number of teams is the same and the talent level hasn't changed dramatically from then to now.

But they have. The rules are different (to Jordan's benefit), players are much better defensively, players are more athletic, and defensive schemes are more advanced. 




 My bad. I'm new here.

And I think Bill Russell being Top 5 should be a given. Top 3 should probably also be without question. 




 That's not necessarily true. We have all the advanced statistics and video to properly judge players relative to their era. It's very practical to rank one player as being greater than anyone else who has played in the NBA. 




 This isn't true at all. You really should research Bill Russell (not even trying to patronize).

His defensive ability was absolutely ridiculous. 




 11 championships, five League MVP awards, All-Defense 1st Team in its first year of existence (his final season), only player to win a championship in his first and last year, and not to mention his galactic impact defensively that literally affected the entire league (and will never come close to being replicated).

In my opinion, he clearly has a case as the greatest player of all time over Jordan or whoever you have up there. 




 He who asks shall receive! Even jokingly.

 Any video from any site.

Why? Because I just don't give a fuck.

Seriously though, I love Big Show's finisher. It's simple yet devastating, and depending on the sell, it can look extremely convincing.

So go ahead and post a video of your favorite Big Show KO Punch (and timestamp or tell me what time in the video if necessary). Then sit back and wait for the GIF. :D 




 Dolphins1925 screwed Dolphins1925 




 That single event in 2002 pretty much fucked up my entire life, to this day. I became cold toward others, I became so depressed that I lost the will to do much of anything. My grades slipped (I was always a very good student and very intelligent), I never finished high school, I couldn't even make it through community college, and I've never gotten a job by legitimate means (my dad got me one, and a friend got me another one).

I've also accrued significant debt, have very little money to my name, no job, and take five different psychiatric medications on a daily basis. 




 I was 13 years old, raised Christian, with no one in my family (including myself at that point) even considering the fact that the Christian God might not exist.

Christmas was always one of my favorite holidays, and it was my mother's, too. She and I were very close to one another, and we had a lot of fun every year setting up decorations and receiving/giving presents.

Then, in the Christmas season of 2002, I noticed that she was less jovial than usual and was spending a lot more time in bed than usual. Me and my dad decorated the house, which I usually did with my mom. I was told she was just a little under the weather and would be fine soon.

On December 22, she passed away from cancer. Three days before Christmas. Three days before our favorite holiday. I was 13 years old.

I was broken emotionally and probably still haven't recovered. It wasn't long after that when I decided that I refuse to worship a god who would take something like that away from me at the worst possible time.

Then, my big cousin, who I was closest to after my mother passed, was killed in a car accident last year. He was 26 years old. I am, and have been for a long time, perpetually depressed, feeling like I want to cry pretty much 24/7. But not when I was around my cousin. He was such a happy, funny, effervescent, and most importantly, nice guy that it was impossible for me to be depressed around him. Every time he came over and we played video games together, I never ever felt depressed. He and I would crack jokes and have as good a time as you'd ever see me have. And now I'm never going to see him again.

At that point, I firmly decided that if God exists, he can send me to Hell, because I will absolutely not bow before a deity whose existence hasn't even been close to being proven, and who (if he DOES exist) is taking away the few people in my life that I have a strong relationship with.

If he wants to condemn me to the underworld because I don't believe he exists, due to a significant lack of hard evidence, then so be it. 




 Back when my house had a serious mouse problem, I once saw two mice chasing each other. One would chase the other, then they'd turn around and the other one would chase, and so on.

I swear to God they were playing tag.

* Reddit

And I want to add a label that reads "[A]" at the beginning of each one, which would give me:

* [A] Google
* [A] Yahoo
* [A] Reddit

Can I do that with a single command/function, or would I have to go through each file and add the label myself?

Thanks.

 Maybe he comes from a country where it's perfectly normal. 




 I've always loved the *Saw* series, and I find myself enamored with John Kramer's machinations. I've often thought of what kind of "game" he'd force someone I know to play, or even myself.

In short, I love Saw, and I love creative writing. So hit me, Reddit.

Oddly enough, this is one of the few times when I hope this WON'T reach the front page. That'd be a lot of work.

Also, if you don't mind, let me know if you're male or female and your age. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, it's okay. Just don't even mention it in your comment.

**NOTE:** I made this thread before, but I never got around to actually typing up the narratives of the tests I'd thought of. I promise to do so this time, though! 




 Every time I look at the "Pedigree" entry, and I see the "(x3)" next to Undertaker at WrestleMania 27, I have to remind myself that it actually happened.

That is unreal on a galactic level, especially when you consider that he also took a goddamned TOMBSTONE PILEDRIVER.

And WON THE MATCH.

Good Lord. 




 But the thing is that Cena didn't gradually build up to the FU/AA (in kayfabe), and while you make a good point about Shawn Michaels, his superkick has put down some of the most credible wrestlers in recent history. The Twist of Fate doesn't have that to say for itself. 




 Shawn Michaels is amazing at telling a story during a match (his "Concussion" match vs Orton was barely even a wrestling match, yet it was still extremely entertaining, at least IMO), and it's really this simple-- he knows what he's doing in the ring more than anyone in WWE history (arguably). I've never seen him botch noticeably, and he knows his opponent's tendencies, as well as just how to work a match or even one spot, that it's almost impossible for him to put on a bad match.

He's one of those guys who either never makes mistakes, or when he does, you can't even tell, because he covers it up.

Remember when DX vs Rated RKO (I think) broke down because of Triple H's torn quad? Orton was running around like a lunatic, confused as hell (not a slight-- he was very young), but Shawn handled the situation as perfectly as he could have. On top of all that, he's also arguably the best face character of all time.

**tl;dr** Shawn Michaels is the Michael Jordan of pro wrestling. 




  I defy anyone to tell me that Angle pulling the straps back up, just so he can pull them down again isn't one of the greatest spots ever.

It was an amazing portmanteau of goofy Angle and wrestling-machine Angle. It seems kind of goofy to do, but he was so determined to win and prove he's a superior wrestler that he needed to get into the zone while already being in the zone. 




 Goddamnit, I came in here to read stories of failure. Fuck all you people with your "I never thought this amazing thing would happen and it did! :D" posts.

I hate my life. 




 I think it's a bit early for that. He's won, what, four matches with it? 




 I'd be hesitant to use moves that started off as just signature moves that didn't end a match, and then eventually became finishers.

But if you can convince me otherwise, I'm definitely listening. 




 That was in 1996, though.

Eventually, I might extend this into the 1990s. Could be fun.

 Best-looking stolen finisher I've ever seen. 




 When, exactly? The problem with Sweet Chin Music is that Michaels almost never hits it after tuning up the band, and when he hits the "out of nowhere" version, he usually collapses from fatigue, which keeps him from getting an immediate pin. 




 [Did I miss something?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=Btn1RwdSsAU#t=917) 




 [This looks like the sequence you're talking about.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZJBmM-jFKA feature=player_detailpage#t=1386) It was a roundhouse kick, not a GTS. 




 I don't think it's spelled that way... 




 I only watched that match once, and wasn't really paying attention since I figured it'd be underwhelming compared to the last four WrestleMania matches Undertaker has. I wouldn't be surprised if Punk did, though. 




 I love when Punk does that. Just like he did at Night of Champions against Cena. His own finishers weren't working, so he was like "Fuck it" and pulled out the most random Rock Bottom ever. 




 That's actually a very good point. I definitely think that could qualify as a "no-sell." 




 By the way, I think we can all agree (as if it had to be confirmed) that this cements the fact that Undertaker at WrestleMania is the most credible wrestler of the modern era (in major United States wrestling, at least)?

I can only imagine Hogan and Goldberg as possibly being his equal. 




 I also wanna say maybe the World's Strongest Slam? But Henry's been around for so long that I'd assume someone has kicked out of it cleanly at some point. 




 I guess you don't go 434 consecutive days as a world champion with a finisher that doesn't put people down on the first try.

Also, I'm probably missing many instances of numerous finisher kick-outs, so bear that in mind. I listed all that I could think of after research and going off of my own memory. 




 The Jackhammer should fit that description, but Hogan was forced to kick out during a match in which Kevin Nash was supposed to break up the pin, but was too slow to get into the ring.

If I recall, that is the only time anyone has ever kicked out of the Jackhammer.

Honorable mention to Beth Phoenix's Glam Slam. Only Natalya has kicked out of that move. 




 This has always been one of my favorite parts of wrestling. Seeing wrestlers kick out of credible finishers, with no/minimal delay between the finish of the move and the pin (due to an incapacitated referee or a wrestler "crashing" due to fatigue after using his finisher).

To be honest, this isn't what it might look like-- a list of the best matches in which one can find at least a single false finish. I intend this to be more about discovering/discussing which finishers are most credible, and/or which wrestlers have the (kayfabe) durability to survive the most effective finishers of the last decade-plus.

This list is going mostly off of memory, with me going back to find video to confirm and make sure I'm right. Others are free to contribute by correcting mistakes on my part, listing occurrences I missed, telling me any finishers you think should be added, or anything else that you feel might add to the thread.

I also included some instances of "No-selling," where a wrestler takes a finisher, and immediately recovers, usually to apply a ground-based submission (Undertaker's Hell's Gate, Lesnar's Kimura Lock, etc). I understand that this is very much a judgment call, so I'll listen to any and all opinions regarding this aspect of this list.

I'll post links to as many videos of each occurrence as I can, but for now, I'll leave it as is until I see how well-received this thread is. I apologize to anyone who might want video of the below instances.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the positive feedback everyone, and the suggestions for entries/moves to be added. I'll definitely try to add everything that was pointed out some time today.

Keep em comin!

**EDIT 2:** Just a request to make things a little easier on my part-- not trying to be too demanding, but it'd help me out a lot if when you guys let me know "[X wrestler] kicked out of [Y finisher] at [Z event]," to provide video if possible. That'll make it easier for me to add it to the listing, and it will confirm it more quickly than me having to look everything up myself.

Suggestions are, of course, still welcomed. In fact, they're allowed.

**EDIT 3:** Undertaker's no-sell of the GTS and Punk kicking out of the Tombstone at WrestleMania have been added, as well as a few others, and some links added.

 Little known fact: You get better acoustic quality with dixie cups. They were actually ergonomically designed for this purpose-- then people just started drinking stuff out of them for whatever reason.

Weirdos.

Or two dixie cups tied together by a string. 




 I really don't wanna be that guy, but seriously? This is basic high-school stuff. 




 Kid used to bully me in like 3rd grade for no reason. Never forgot his name or what he looks like.

15 years later, I go to get lunch and find out he's a minimum wage slave at McDonald's.

I'm not saying I Success Kid'd in my head, but... 




 What about the option of using the "Master password" option some browsers have? I've never tried it, but I've seen it while going through my settings. 




 Exactly. Joyner hosted both shows from 1985 to 1993. Almost 30 years ago. 




 I'd assume that if it was possible to host both shows from the same place, he'd have done it. 









 Believe it or not, I couldn't find a clip of that Spear that I felt comfortable using. I don't like using the regular, standard, zoomed-out camera angle. It's a shame that I wasn't able to include it, too-- it's one of his best Spears in WWE.

I tried to make up for it by showing him flattening Christian three times _

 Black vest screamin "Ryback, I don't fit you!" 




  "Hey I noticed you sat next to me while being cute."

That right there is an A+ pick-up line. 




 I don't think anyone's beaten Undertaker three times in a row at all (one-on-one), much less on three consecutive pay-per-view events.

Good insight. 









 Is there a designated "GIF-making" user on here? If it doesn't get made tonight, I can do it early tomorrow morning most likely. 




 Because people think they're smart/hilarious when they chant the name of someone's previous gimmick or a wrestler they resemble. It's like a lot of people paid for their tickets to just act like a jackass on TV and maybe watch some wrestling, too. Which is fine; it's their right. But that doesn't mean I have to like it. 




 But that doesn't mean that other people won't feel like the show is a little tainted. They're not wrong for cheering and booing whoever they want, but it does sort of degrade the show to some people when the wrestlers are trying to stay in kayfabe and the crowd is breaking it all night long. 




 The fact that he's heel makes him a lot less "Goldbergy" than before. Throughout his entire US wrestling career, Goldberg was a heel for about 4 minutes. 




 Six years and 364 days later, he lost a one-on-one match to CM Punk on SmackDown (06/22/10).

After the seven-year anniversary of Kane's unmasking passed the next day, he went three months without being defeated, with most of that time coinciding with his reign as World Heavyweight Champion.

Kane broke a mirror, unmasked against his will, and had a horrible streak of losses and bad breaks for the next *seven years*...

Then, as SOON as seven years passed, he went on a very solid winning streak (11 straight wins from the end of June to the beginning of October), and during that winning streak won his first world championship in over a decade.

Coincidence, or an amazingly thorough angle that was never even brought up?

**EDIT:** For those wondering when Kane broke the mirror-- it was a backstage segment right before the match that probably isn't well-known at this point (I probably wouldn't have known, either, if I hadn't found this video on my hard drive one day when I was bored).

[Here's a GIF for those who don't remember](http://3.imgland.net/620vRz.gif) 




 All I remember is that Ranjin Singh had a jacket that read "THE GREAT KHALI SAYS..." on the back.

I wanted one of those. 




 "I saw you on the other side of the room, and I'm gonna be honest with you... I said to myself 'This girl is so fine... she is SO out of my league, that I have to say something.' So I'll just ask... could I take you out some time? Maybe for coffee? Nothing too serious. I'd just love to get to know you."

They laugh at the "SO out of my league" part every time. 




 Gotcha.

Also, to summarize what you said about 3-4 vs 4-3, it seems like 3-4 is better against outside runs (since you get the extra speed with the additional linebacker), whereas 4-3 is good against inside runs, with the two tackles attempting to clog the middle. Is that right?

And for what it's worth, I just noticed that the Patriots' 4-3 pretty much looks like a 3-4. Instead of four linemen in three-point stance and three linebackers behind them, they have three linemen in the 3PS, with Ninkovich and Mayo at the line of scrimmage, flanking the linemen on either side. How should I treat this formation? Could this work similarly to a 3-4? 




 Also, maybe you could help me tackle this dilemma?

http://www.reddit.com/r/footballstrategy/comments/1nessp/i_want_to_learn_advanced_football_strategy_to/cciemug

**EDIT:** Heh. "Tackle." Football humor.

/Squidward 




 Haha, fair enough. That sounds pretty good for me, since I'm an offense-first guy (might have been obvious, given the team I use).

One more quick Q-- let's say I see a one-deep safety look, but the defense is actually running two deep safeties. One of the safeties might come down into the box (even though he's still going to play deep), but I should be able to exploit the fact that he's too close to the LoS with deep routes to his side, right? 




 I always try to apply this mindset: "Don't assume that, since you can't smell you, other people can't smell you." 




 Quick question regarding position play-- Jerod Mayo is listed as a ROLB in Madden, and Spikes as the MLB. Generally, if I'm gonna run a defense with only one linebacker (like Dime), I'd want my best linebacker on the field, right?

On Pro Football-Reference, both Mayo and Spikes are listed as simply "LB." Would switching their positions and having Mayo at MLB potentially hurt my defense more than it helps? 




 Is there any way the defense could disguise that type of look to make it appear as if the safety is compromising the weak side of the field, but they actually have the entire field covered (as best as a defense can)?

I guess technically there definitely is a way to disguise it, but how easy is it? Should I expect to see people do this, or are most not knowledgeable enough to do so? 




  Basically, if the defense is showing one high safety against a pass-heavy formation like trips right, the hole in their defense is likely to be on the left. 

But, just to be sure, one high safety could also mean that they have three deep defenders, right? I suppose that's something I have to identify at the snap-- look to see if the other safety and a corner drop back into deep zones as soon as the play starts. 




 Wouldn't a play with two or three deep zones be better for defending deep throws than just one safety playing deep? 




 I've actually always thought about that. Generally, a guy can see a cute girl that he doesn't know and try to charm her with small talk, and then ask for the digits. For the most part, worst-case scenario is that she'll respectfully decline, as long as the guy doesn't come off as an ass or doesn't take no for an answer. Most of the time, at the very least, the girl is flattered.

Gay guys don't have that luxury. Straight men aren't flattered by having gay guys make a move on them. Plus, there's no way to tell for sure if another guy is gay, and if you hit on the wrong straight guy (read: probably around 90% of straight guys, because people are stupid and judgmental), you could definitely get into a fight.

That must suck. 




 I would do this, but I'm trying to stream music to use in NBA 2K13 as Custom Arena Sounds, and it has to either be burned to a CD or streaming from a PC. 




 This is where my motto of "Fuck you and your happiness" regarding anyone in a happy, healthy relationship comes in handy. 




 I would use Windows Media Player normally, but it seems to use a lot of CPU power, even when idling (I have an Intel Mobile Core 2 Duo). Can I use a program like Vuze to do this? I only ask because I'm already somewhat familiar with the program.

If there are any other programs that you guys feel might work well, I'm all ears.

Thanks. 




   I like to use my backs out of the backfield if I see **a single high safety towards trips**

Could you elaborate on this a little? What exactly does that mean (mostly wondering about the "towards trips" part-- I know trips refers to 3 WRs on the same side, and single high safety means one safety deep pre-snap)?

Thanks. 




 I think I'll just cut out the middle man and use the camera to see at all times 









 I really hope you don't start talking to mannequins in abandoned video stores. 




 Will definitely check that out, thanks. 




 I watch a lot of football, and sometimes it's hard to tell why players make certain decisions. I also watch NFL Playbook on the NFL Network sometimes, even though it can be a little confusing every now and then.

I'll definitely take a look at that link too. Thanks. 




 First off, thanks a lot for the speedy reply. I'm pleasantly surprised at this. Anyway:

 As for alignment, the numbers just refer to linemen then linebackers. A 4-3 is 4 linemen and 3 linebackers.

Yeah, I know that much (I think). Nickel would be essentially 4-3, except the third linebacker is replaced by a cornerback, and Dime replaces the second AND third linebacker with cornerbacks, leaving one linebacker on the field.

That's why I figured counting linebackers could help (IIRC, linebackers always have jersey numbers in the 50s). Two guys wearing 50-something? Nickel. One guy? Dime.

What you said about the nose tackle and identifying 4-3 vs 3-4 is exactly what I was talking about when I said I used to be able to do that. Relaying that information to me is a great place to start, and I appreciate it.

Also, since we're talking about it, when I'm on defense, how do I decide between 4-3 or 3-4, or even Nickel? They're all somewhat versatile formations, aren't they?

I use New England by the way, if that helps. Their linebackers have pretty good size, Jerod Mayo is an absolute beast, and I think Hightower and Spikes have good speed and tackling ability. Plus I have Wilfork on the nose, and Rob Ninkovich is a pretty fundamentally sound LB/DE (if I'm wrong about any of this, feel free to correct me).

So, given my personnel, how should I decide between 4-3, 3-4, Nickel, etc.? Dime is mainly for defending the pass-- I know that much. But between the other three formations I mentioned, which is good for runs, or short passes, or maybe situations where the defense has a ton of options (like 2nd and 5 or 6 maybe)?

If I have any other questions, I'll let you know... if I haven't burnt you out by now. Thanks again. 




 Beth Phoenix main-evented one Raw towards the end of January in 2011, I think. Can't remember exactly when. It wasn't announced throughout the show as the main event, but it was the last match. Close enough. 




 The first thing I guess I should do is let you know how much I know about the sport. I'm no newb to advanced football strategy, but I'm definitely not an expert either. 

I know things like how to read the safeties pre-snap (one deep means Cover 1 man/zone or Cover 3 zone, two deep means Cover 2 man/zone or Cover 4-- not always, obviously, just mostly). However, **I can't look at a defense and tell you for sure if it's a 4-3, 3-4, Nickel, Dime, etc.** This is especially difficult in Madden, since you can't see the players' numbers pre-snap, so it's impossible to simply count the linebackers and go from there. I'd have to be able to look at the alignment of all the defenders and memorize what each formation looks like in this regard (which I used to be good at, but not anymore).

I'm also okay at identifying zone/man right after the ball is snapped. If the defenders turn their hips to chase the receivers, man. If they stay squared to the line of scrimmage even as receivers run past them, zone. Easy. But at the same time, **I find it difficult to identify (or even make an educated guess of) zone vs man before the snap.** I'm not even sure if this is possible for someone who doesn't play the quarterback position at an organized level, but if it is, I'd love to learn how.

I'd also like to learn things like reading blitzes pre-snap, knowing when to adjust your blocking schemes (i.e., block left/right/pinch/aggressive) before the snap depending on what the defense does, how to adjust to certain strategies during the course of a game, etc.

Would you guys be willing to help me with this? I know a lot of people would probably recommend some of the websites that specialize in teaching this knowledge, but I learn better by actually talking to people and absorbing information through conversation, as opposed to simply reading a generic write-up (not saying they can't be helpful, but I learn better this way).

Thanks, guys. 




 6-7 minutes with accelerated clock won't get you realistic stats in my opinion. 10-12 should work.

I wish I could play on 15. I like my games to be as realistic as possible, and I hate playing less than the real-life amount of time per quarter. But still, I'm gonna try to manage playing on 10-12.

If I can suck it up and do it, anyone can. 




 I know this is something that can't be completely identified via statistics, but which stats exist, if any, that come closest to doing so?

Is there a site that shows quarterbacks' completion percentages by distance that the ball travels? I know they have a stat called "Air Yards," which is a measure of how far a QB throws the ball when completing a pass (basically passing yards minus yards after catch), but I don't know if that would work very well.

Any suggestions? 




 Misread the last word on the bottom caption. Got confused and wondered how having a tiger as a best friend would help me get a job. 




 I have an Intel Mobile Core 2 Duo processor, and the reason I ask this is because I use WMP to stream music to my Xbox 360. So, ostensibly, the program has to be running the entire time I stream. But the problem is that, even when I'm not actively doing anything in the program, it seems to take up a great deal of my CPU usage.

Is this normal? Is there a way I can mitigate this? Is there another program I can use to stream music and playlists to my 360?

Thanks.

 Using Windows 7 Ultimate, 64-bit with Comcast internet connected via wireless router.

Every time I run the program, my internet randomly drops for a few minutes at a time, although there are no actual indications. Nothing on the modem changes, my connection status stays the same, and the torrents even keep going. But anything that has to be reloaded (web pages, etc.) will not work (I'll get the same error message I'd get if I turned my internet off).

I couldn't figure out why until someone on this subreddit suggested it might be my torrent program, so I did some testing, and discovered that when the program isn't running, my internet has no problems at all. And when the program *is* running, I get the issues that I described earlier.

Is there anything you guys would recommend here so that I can run my torrent program without compromising my internet connection?

Thanks.

  My soul (waste of 21 grams if you ask me)

They'd have a heck of a time procuring it, I think. 




 This question came to me earlier today, when I realized that I could probably make at least a few bucks if I sold a miniature collection of rare currencies from around the world.

The reason I would never sell it is because my late mother (whom I was EXTREMELY close to) gave them to me on a business trip when I was 12 (she passed when I was 13). Her job required that she travel globally, and she spent nearly all my life collecting coins and what have you from different countries, because she knew I loved rare currencies.

Every time she left for a business trip, I would cry myself to sleep almost every night because I missed her so much, so she made sure that at least once a week, I got a letter from her telling her how much she misses and loves me. One day, a small zipper pouch came with one of the letters, and it had [this picture](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UcAUEMTbGcw/UZ0bChxy_xI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/D1YH81lzbN8/s1600/Guess+How+Much+I+Love+You.jpg) on it. It was the last gift I ever got from her, and I cried when I saw it in the envelope with the letter.

I keep it right next to my bed on my table, I never move it, and I never put anything on top of it. Every time I pass the end table, I look at it and smile while holding back tears.

I would never even think about selling it. For any price. Ever.

 The idea is that if you go back in time and change things from the way they were normally, things in the future could be drastically different in a seemingly unrelated way. For example, in Ray Bradbury's "The Sound of Thunder" (I think), one of the characters steps on a butterfly's wing while in the past, and finds that in the "new" present, words are spelled differently, and things like that (presumably because of an incomprehensibly long chain of events).

Wouldn't that apply to going to the past, on its own? Just your presence in the past can alter things. You could leave footprints where there weren't any before, or cover up the tracks of something that *was* there. You could startle a person or catch their attention as you walk by, which keeps them from focusing on what they were doing, which could change their day, which could change the area, which could change the world. Etc.

But characters always seem to say "Don't touch anything, don't move anything, and be as discreet as possible." Not "Man, even just being in the past is probably gonna make the present noticeably different." If I'm wrong about this, feel free to correct me. It's been a while since I've seen/read a work of fiction involving time travel and the butterfly effect.

 User /u/cobalthawk gave me a link to [this website](http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/content/walladapter.html) (and I appreciate it!), but I figure I might screw up and get the wrong one.

As such, I thought maybe the best way to go about this would be to look at the little information sticker on the adapter with letters that are barely big enough to read, and use that information to find an adapter online that I know for sure will work.

Is that possible/plausible? If so, would you guys mind helping me with it?

Thanks. 




 Nah, no way. Guys don't think about stuff like that generally. You could be shy, you could be sheltered, you could just have had more important things in your life than intimate relationships, etc.

I doubt many people would assume something's wrong with you.

 [Being immortal would suck balls.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/WhoWantsToLiveForever) I hate kids, but I'll take that choice in a second.

 Why do next week what you can say you'll do next week and then never do it? 




 I run into this problem a lot on my TV Tropes watchlist. 




 Well, we don't really have to worry about that. I've given up on women for good. I can live with being literally forever alone. 




 Nope. Never even got close to getting in trouble. tbqh, I suspect some women really like it. It's like, they're so attractive, that even when they're asleep, I can't resist my urge to have them.

It's actually a lot easier than you might think to ask a woman "Can I do stuff to you while you sleep?" At least once you get to know her and you're comfortable around each other. Usually, once we at least sleep together, she's sorta used to my nighttime tendencies, since I absolutely love to spoon, so of course I cop a feel every now and then during. 




 I used to. Two, actually (not at the same time). One can't hold her liquor at all (she was my first, regarding this fetish-- it was actually her idea o_O), and another is borderline narcoleptic. She falls asleep in an instant and is an extremely heavy sleeper.

I feel like the universe did me a solid by giving me two women who are so conducive to my fetish. I believe in highly unlikely coincidences, but damn that's lucky. 




 Really? Did this post really offend someone?

Come on, talk to me. My curiosity has been piqued. 




 Therapy? For what reason? It hasn't gotten me in any trouble. There are ways to act on this attraction in a legal manner. It's not intrinsically a situation that will always be considered rape (something the first commenter clearly does not realize). 




 I am black, and I was just kidding. I thought shifty-eyes was the universal Internet emoticon to indicate facetiousness. 




 Most likely shyness. I've always been worried that the things I like (sexually) would turn a woman off out of weirdness or simply because it's mostly for my satisfaction and not hers.

For example, I love to simply touch up and down a woman's body with my hands, and do nothing more. I could do this all night, without any intercourse or anything else, and be completely satisfied. Of course, if a woman was awake and you literally did that for 5 straight hours, she'd get bored or annoyed. 




 Whether it's touching them, simply looking, kissing, spooning, undressing, etc.

To be clear, this has nothing to do with rape. Lack of consent is not where the attraction comes from. The attraction, at least for me, mostly comes from being in control without really having to assert oneself (I've always been shy sexually).

AMA. And I meant absolutely anything.

**NOTE:** I did post this a few days ago, but didn't get many responses. Hope a re-post so soon is okay.

**EDIT:** Forgot to add, I'm a 24-year-old male. 




 Not a loaded question at all, I'm just trying to figure out why we even bother resorting to war at all. I would assume fewer people dying in cold blood over political issues would be better. 




 I understand the basic concept of diplomacy, but I'm not an expert. Why hasn't it decreased the need for violent wars? Or has it? 




 Damn, guys. It was a joke. 




 But Steve Nash was born there, that's the difference. If you don't know who he is, he's [clearly not a black man.](https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1191506948/steve-nash.jpg) 









 So what would the inverse of this be?

"Yes, I realize that I am a dude"? 




 Because the OP clearly had to go after 15 minutes and run errands, such as snitching to the police, and reading books. smh. 




 Sellout. _ 




  I see it as a colloquial term of endearment between friends

That's exactly what it is. But for some reason, black culture condemns the use of the word by white people, even if it's clear as goddamn day that it's just a synonym for "friend" or "homie." 




 This is true (well, kinda-- hispanics are allowed, too).

It's stupid for black people to do it, but it is indeed true. And this is coming from a black man. 




 Does he have South African citizenship? I assume he'd be considered Canadian.

 Just replace "Santa" with "God" (or the deity/ies of any religion), and "getting presents" with "going to Heaven/not going to Hell" (or the equivalent for another religion).

I'm not even sure if this word exists, but I swear I've heard a word or phrase for it before. 









 Wouldn't the digestion process, especially the stomach acid, kill the prey as well? 




 I think he's saying the fact that people on the Internet aren't typing at random makes this quote fallacious, since (it seems) that the "monkeys" are being replaced metaphorically by people who use the Internet.

Of course a bunch of people typing coherent thoughts on a keyboard won't produce the complete works of Shakespeare, unless they choose to. This is totally different from the Infinite Monkey Theorem.

I think that's what rasmustrew is saying. 




 This is actually a really good question. There are two ways around this:

* I can ask for her consent when she's awake, and if she trusts me enough, I usually get the green light. If she says she'd be uncomfortable with it, I accept it and let her know I won't do anything (I tend to stay awake later than my partner at night, and I love to spoon).

* Or, she can fake it. Sometimes they'll wake up, and if I know it's a regular thing between us and she's fine with the fact that I'm doing it, I'll say something coy like "Just go back to slip." You know, half-joking. At that point, she just sighs or rolls her eyes facetiously, and does so. I've been told that when this happens, she actually didn't go back to sleep, and just faked it.

* I've also been told that they've woken up, but without me realizing it, and they continue to pretend they're asleep.

It is, as you inferred, a very tricky paraphilia to manage, but I haven't had any complaints yet. 




 Anything at all.

Also note: This is NOT a rape fetish. It's not based on a lack of consent. It's based mostly on being in charge without having to assert yourself, and having the freedom to do what you want without your partner finding it weird or dissatisfying (at least for me). 




 What your brain will tell you: Wallow in it and do nothing.

What you should do: Something you enjoy that can significantly distract you from anything other than the fact that you like doing it. 




 He said there wasn't a huge problem with PEDs, but guys who played in South America like he did would try to buy cocaine from there since it's cheaper, and then smuggle it into America during the off-season when they came back to the States.

Most got caught.

 I've been taking anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medications, and they're actually helping. Good news, obviously.

But it turns out to be somewhat of a lose-lose scenario. When I'm miserable and depressed, obviously that's not a good thing.

When I'm actually somewhat happy (and don't feel like breaking down into a heap and sobbing because I feel like complete shit for damn near no reason), it doesn't last.

Because almost as soon as I start to feel "happy" (I use that word tentatively-- "not cripplingly depressed" would probably be more accurate), I start thinking about my life. I start thinking about how my life isn't really that bad. I start thinking about how I'm having a good day and everything isn't darkness and misery.

Then I start thinking about how all that is going to go away, because eventually, I will die. I'm sure this won't surprise anyone, but I don't want to die. I don't want to not exist. I can barely fathom the concept.

I try to think of life like a plate of your favorite food. You eat it, you enjoy it, and you eventually finish it. But are you sad when it's all gone? No, because you're full. You've had as much as you want. Hopefully, life is like a plate of food, and by the time we finish it, it won't be an emotional burden, because we've done nearly everything we wanted to and won't necessarily find it to be heart-wrenchingly tragic that we will die.

But I'm starting to think this line of reasoning is less and less plausible everyday.

Writing this actually made me feel a little better. But not by much. I'm still in a psychological malaise over the fact that all this is going to be taken away from me eventually. 




 Sorry for being so late with the answer, but if you still care, he said that the craziest thing he'd ever seen as a pro basketball player happened during a tournament in South America. The winner of the game would advance to the Finals of the tourney, and my dad was on the away team.

My dad was "kicking ass" as he claimed (and trust me-- believe him), and when there was like 2 minutes or so left and his team was up 18, the entire crowd started throwing C and D batteries at the players and officials. And they actually let them finish barraging the players with Alkalines and finished the game.

If you meant the craziest non-basketball thing he's seen, I can ask him that.
