 Put me down, human! 




 Did anyone think of Katara when she said, "If you're man enough"?! 




 It seems like Lightening bending is a lot more common. In episode 3, wasn't that what Mako was doing in the powerplant? What do you guys think? 









 Secret Tunnellllll! Secret Tunnellllll!....fuck 




 What about Suki?? 




 Anyone know how he could possibly be alive? He'd be well into his 2nd century if he was friends with Monk Gyatso... 




 While she does "lack of restraint", I think her airbending training with Tenzin will help her flesh out her moral values. Airbending is more spiritual in nature, so maybe her core values will be shown as she advances with Tenzin.  




 Um, lets not forget Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). He voiced Fire Lord Ozai. Mind fuck? 




 You know, that would freakin' awesome! I want that to happen now!  




 It is on a lot of things, but it was clearly brought to attention when the car was shown. For that reason, I think it may have more significance than just being tradition.  




 This may have been mentioned, but I think we're gonna be seeing Aang again in the Spirit World. This makes me super happy and if we don't see him, I will not be having a good time.  




 The image is from season two. I was just wondering if Mako, a firebender, is somehow related to Zuko and by extension, Iroh's son.

 Hmmm..this reminds me of someone... 




 For mac. Shift+volume keys gets rid of the obnoxious bleep 




 Anyone notice the person in the background? 




 Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.
Fuzzy wuzzy ...had cancer?    




 Put on Spike: Star Wars marathon. 




 If you knew you were going to die from a terminal illness, who would you want to meet knowing it would be your last chance?
