 http://youtu.be/YfczJAB-lKk here's the video, [SPOILER ALERT] 




 I kind of remember this happening in the first movie in the after credits, I would go more in dept but I don't want to spoil the movie 




 Its after the credits i think, can't remember though 




 I did not scare her, I did not

Oh hi Mark! 




 Nope, first [REC] and an enjoyable movie actually, quarantine was awful 




 "Oh shitfuck i shouldn't have listened to my dad" 




 So, RoS fixes the flaws of Diablo 3? I got D3 a while ago and played it for a bit BUT deleted it in a rage because of all the flaws it had (been a HUGE Diablo fan from the first game)

Does RoS let you play offline? 

(oh sweet baby Jesus let the answer be yes) 




 Lol, are you mental? 




 I can hear the angels singing

[heavy breathing intensifies] 




 I would try this if I weren't a dumbass who would surely die electrocuted 




 Somebody should add the deal with it glasses to this
