 I will definitely get a hold of you by the end of the month! This kinda makes me laugh cause we are close to all the exact same achievements. 




 Well this was a flop, being the same night as Battlefront night lol 




 After /r/halo game night sure:)
 




 On H3, I just did a party of 6 for 7onthe7th
 




 So I had been grinding away in Reach trying to get ANY of the achievements I'm missing and decided to take a break from slayer and went to Grifball to calm down. Well, very first match I get in is against a party of four. All of them high ranked, all of them above a 3 year tenure, all of them resorting to poor sportsmanship. Honestly, Reach used to be one of my favorite games but this just absolutely killed it for me. 









 I just got out of a game of Grifball for some relaxation and all I got was the opposite. I'll post a video so you can see what I mean. But yeah, theres not to many ways you can boost anymore for alot of achievements
 




 I did for 3 Halo 3 achievements but past that, nobody has helped me with anything DLC. 




 I guess I should clarify achievemental 100%! I could easily get the Halo 4 max but Inheritor and Halo 3 max would take a bit. 




 CURSE YOU! The first one I think I know in a while, I get wrong. I'm rereading Cole Protocol again lol 




 Hey all!!! AC here! So since it's Friday and I am entirely free, I will be hosting an ODST Firefight game night! I will open up my party at 7:30-8:00 PM (CST)! Message Troop4921 if you want to join or start a second party if we need to! Send me your videos and pictures if you capture any!:D 




 VERY excited about the Champions Bundle! 




 Yeah I kinda figured solo would be 1000x of times easier and no matter how much my friend and I joke, neither of us are true Spartans lol. I think the most badass Spartan-esque thing I have ever done was I beat Pillar of Autumn on Halo Reach Legendary and died twice which was awesome. 




 lol I think I was trying on legendary with a friend and we figured out, when you die, you respawn with forerunner weapons so its definitely a no-no on legendary 




 Hey guys! AC here! So, about a month ago, I posted on /r/halo about my summer goal which is to earn 100% in ALL the Halo games(excluding Halo 2 Vista).

 The Flood gives a bit of a more in depth look at it. More emotion is kinda the only plus. 




 Theres plenty of smaller subreddits that I think don't get enough attention. /r/ODST and /r/UNSC included. 




 What was THC itself may I ask? Was it like a forum, a blog, or what?
 




 Would someone please fill in a n00b on what THC was and the rivalry between them and Beyond? 




 Possibly, or nonexistent. I don't know. The code breakers are pretty good about cracking them really quick and finding the codes withing 2-3 weeks of release. 




 It could but it has its own subreddit for the same reason that /r/UNSC is its own subreddit. Some people have a deeper "passion" for certain aspects of Halo. 




 Mk. VI I believe? Also, if it was solo, there is a code for even more goodies on Halo Waypoint. 




 I looked at my Sect. 3 files and I do not think that there is a code for Crimson DLC. I found one on Majestic, Castle, and several other things. I would suggest watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjb_6PppG8s) video to see if there are any codes you have missed. 









 I am x-posting to /r/ODST if you don't mind. 




 *loudly applaudes* Congratulations! 




 Depends. If you are going for the information and understanding then go:
*Reach
*Anniversary
*Halo 2
*ODST
*Halo 3
*Halo 4
 All of which I would do on Normal or Heroic just so you still have fun with it and can focus on the story. If your just playing to see the progression the games have made, play in your order on Heroic with at least one skull on to add a small challenge. 




 Can we get an update on his status? 




 I saw "agensed" and noped the fuck off that picture. 




 Oh he'll be *pushing* Daisies alright. 




 The shoulder look a bit tight but past that, I have been needing to trim weight anyways. Thankfully, I am getting a job soon so the money won't be *too* much of a problem. Thanks for the answers! 




 What did you use to make it? Pepakura, fiberglass, foam? How much did all materials cost? How much time? General size requirements. 




 How much did it cost to make it and would you be willing to sell for ~$50 more than you made it for? 




 I had bought the limited edition so I got all the map packs for free(ish). I would agree to make the DLC free or reduced and bring back a playlists for DLC only. 




 Ill help
 




 From what I have heard that is true, that Chief did have a didact's geas(Not sure which one though). Also though, since the librarian looked over human kind in the earliest years, It is highly possible she was able to telepathically communicate. 




 Are you still working on it? I did it with a friend a while back and I'd be willing to help someone else 




 How did you steam it?
 




 Gimme gimme gimme 




 lol I am from Missouri and when I was old enough to understand all that stuff, parent explained it to me. I think its an okay idea. lol jk

 GT; Troop4921
 




 I know but still, I wish things like this could be worked out to being lowered just the smallest bit. 




 Lol, And there are segments that are in person so I understand the 18+ but drinking age in most if not all of America is 21 so that wouldnt be a reason for us. 




 Agreed. Sorry all! 




 There was a post a bit back that had their site up on it. I can try and find it again.
 




 I even said, 
"Imagining if I was my character,"
By that I meant, if it was in real life and I was my character, then blah blah blah. 




 They converted a video of mine like two weeks ago. They should still be up 




 What would be in the way of rewards? Im hoping nothing cause then people become competitive and will do anything to win. and if there are rewards, make it like a reddit title or just something non-tangible.
 




 Alcohol. At an online tournament? 




 Okay, I can understand not letting squeakers on but at least let it be 16+! The one thing that agitates me is the fact that I cant participate in these tournaments that I would love to do and not being old enough. 




 Fallout 3. Imagining if I was my character, dodging bullets incoming from super mutants a block up the road as I scoot behind a Jersey Barrier. Slowly lifting my assault rifle over and blind firing, hearing one yell out in pain as I vault  over and fire into his chest. I dead sprint straight forward, jumping in the air, screaming out a battle yell, stabbing a combat knife into its head. Yeah, Fallout 3. 




 Sweeney Todd;D Immediately go to New Vegas, get Figaro from the barber for the King, sneak kill Benny. Live the rest of your life Brahmin farming and making pies. 




 Number one thing that aggravates me about tournaments is that you have to be 18+. GAH. 




 Thats exactly what it was!
 




 Im assuming an ingame logo. i will tell you soon
 




 If you get fifty points will you please do it. Set the eggs on fire. Like, make it the worst thing possible.
