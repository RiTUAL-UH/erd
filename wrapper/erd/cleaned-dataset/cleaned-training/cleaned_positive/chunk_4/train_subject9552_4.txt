 To elaborate, the younger generations of this world will have their entire online histories, and therefore, practically the history of their lives, owned by corporations. For example, all their Facebook posts about life events, all their comments and opinions on websites, all their communications with others, will be stored to some degree. When they grow up and some of them run for presidency, or apply for a top position at a multi-billion dollar company, or become famous for activism and such, this history will be documented forever, and can be brought up, and can be used to condemn them. 
What can this suggest for the future? Will people become more honest and open with their history? Will people try to cover up their histories by paying corporations not to release it? Will society just accept that people are not in their best minds on the internet, and ignore it? Or is online history not all that important in the end? Or, will people demand that the history of important candidates and people be public so that society can gauge what kind of person he/she really is?
In addition, where can this go from here? Will medical records, marriage papers, police records, etc. be available online as the world becomes more digitized, and be used for the same purpose?  




 Well, since you live in California, if you could make the trip to SF, you could visit the California Academy of Sciences (amazing place for kids and adults alike), or the Tech Museum in San Jose, NASA Ames in in Bay Area, the Natural History Museum of LA, the Gateway Science Museum in CSU. I would suggest Googling centers nearby.
