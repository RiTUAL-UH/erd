 i like chilling on pokemon showdown, and they have other smaller servers and i can get a custom avatar on those, so i'm wondering if anyone could make a White Walker 80x80 trainer sprite png?

Also i tend to mess up on subreddits a lot, so i apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to ask. 









 well hot damn...

**kthnxbye.** 
























 Note: I'm only 17, my parents probably won't purchase things like After Effects, and I got Sony Vegas from this thing on YouTube that shows you how to get it free. I've also tried to get After Effects and Photoshop free but it doesnt work ;~; 




 alright, well I'm complete noob to all this stuff, I'm only good for making little sports mixes and all that easy stuff, what I would like to know is.

* Can Sony Vegas (Pro 13 if it matters) do this cool VFX stuff I'm seeing you guys post?
* Is there a program that's free that allows me to do all that cool VFX stuff? (If Sony Vegas can't)
* Are there any tutorials you would recommend me watch?

Hopefully, this kind of post is allowed here, if not please direct me to the right subreddit to ask.

EDIT: the word "stuff" counter: 4 times :P
 




 The Trade:

* Cavs get Iman Shumpert(NYK) and JR Smith(NYK)
* Thunder get Dion Waiters(CLE)
* Knicks get Lance Thomas(OKC), Louis Amundson(CLE), and Alex Kirk(CLE)

Knicks also waived Samuel Dalembert.

Thoughts on this, will we have to make change to compete with them next season? 




 well alrighty then.... ._. 



















 wow, I've always loved watching video edits and things like that, and I got into making little sports mixes on youtube, but I've always been interested in VFX and how it works, im only 17 so idk if my parents would pay for software to edit like that, I was able to get Sony Vegas Pro 13 for free online, but anyways, I just want to say what you posted has definitely inspired me to really give vfx a chance, is there any free software that allows me to do this, and also any recommendations on books or youtube videos on how to learn vfx? 




 Sony Vegas Pro 13 




 didnt watch the game today :\


how did the fans welcome granger? any videos of it? 




 Jennifer Lopez who?
Halle Berry who?
You look amazing for your age! 
I rate 11/10 




 Dat ass 




 lol 




 I'll be so pissed off if this show ends, I love Bella Thorne(plus shes hot), because of this show I like Astro after I thought his X Factor performance was cheesy. I was really liking how Leo and Kara were turning out after their relationships ended or whatever you want to considered it, and I really want to know what happened to Emma. 




(P.S. Dr.Naday's accent is cool as hell.) 




 Stuck, Scola, Mahinmi(or Sloan), 2 draft picks for Lance
i'd take it, but it looks like he gonna go to Brooklyn ;~; i miss you Lance. 



















 preferably one track, but if you need to put a Top 3, Top 5, that's fine too.





My Favourite is [February Confessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m7gMKLMkqE)...The Instrumental is soooo good, and his flow is nice.
