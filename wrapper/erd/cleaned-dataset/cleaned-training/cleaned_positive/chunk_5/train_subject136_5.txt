 Hey... whatever works to keep you in shape.  You'll need to let go of the unhealthy obsession with your ex however.  What if she sees you and doesn't care?  Will it send your whole world crashing down? 




 Give it time...  Or you could forgive her.  Those are pretty much your options. 




 It's not like it was bringing down the quality of this subreddit.  Hell, I don't like Success Kid but I don't complain.

"Asked a girl out.  Found out she likes video games."

It's annoying to me but I believe in free speech. 




 I'm confused.   




 I've done this before. 




 Typo in comic.  Will not fap to this image. 




 And all I see is insecurity 




 Hate to break it to you, but that aint your kid bro. 




 Are there no free public wifi areas around?  That's why my brother does to get his hw done.  Plenty of book stores, coffee shops, etc.  Not to mention the computer lab at the school. 




 Wait, not only are you a grad student in HISTORY but you missed your thesis deadline as well?!?!?

 I like the idea,  but this is dangerous because it could also lead to complacency.  I mean why go for that promotion when the job you have now is enough right? 




 Hey... I know it seems bad but keep pressing on. We've all been there.  Especially with the suicidal thoughts.  But why should you stop living just because of someone else?

Like I said, I KNOW it's hard. I still struggle from time to time. Allow yourself to grieve and don't feel bad about it.  Eventually you'll come out of your slump.  Also, leverage your friends and social network.  Now is the time when they're supposed to be there for you. 




 Well it’s officially been 39 days since we last had correspondence, but who’s counting right?



**HOW IT STARTED:**  After a 7 year relationship we broke up.  I tried to get back with her but she didn’t want to.  I went through emotional hell for a six months with contact between us every few days.  Then I got a girlfriend.  After that we still kept talking.  She expressed being upset that I had a girl.  I dumped my girl hoping to get back with my ex.

Bad move.  After that the NC period increased to weekly then eventually to every two weeks.  After having enough, I told her to stop texting me in July because she didn’t really care about me.  

The NC period has been increasing since then hitting a previous high of 17 days.


**HOW I FEEL NOW:**  I don’t really know how to describe how I feel.  I guess ambivalent is a good word.  I have been fortunate enough to be busy recently so I didn’t notice.  After awhile after the days start piling up it becomes easier.

I wish I could say I had closure and everything was well.  But I don’t.  I have no idea what she’s doing, who’s she’s with, or even if she’s alive for that matter.  As for my own love life, I have the benefit of having numerous attractive women who want to be in my company.  I date one in particular at the moment.  But to be honest I’m scared of getting too attached because of being burned from my last relationship.  

**THOUGHTS ABOUT NC:**  I’m conflicted.  On one hand I do believe that it is in the grieving party’s best interest to cut contact ASAP but on the other hand it’s all situational.  I was with someone for 7 years, it would be impossible for me to just stop talking to her unless what she did was very foul.  But I’m also a results kinda guy, and since none of the talking resulted in us getting back togeter I’d just have rather never talked to her again.  What was the point?

Also, I will say that after 30 days nothing magical happens.  Just an FYI

**ADVICE GOING FORWARD:**  If you’re suffering, I would advise making yourself busy and moving on from you ex.  If you talk, don’t listen to what they say, watch what they do.  I made that mistake and never will again.

I asked a good friend how he moved on from his similar situation and these were his wise words:

 “How did I get over the relationship... I didn't. You're not supposed to - not if it has real history and depth and if you both had long stretches during which you truly felt an unselfish love for each other. I carry that loss with me, and I'm lucky if I make it a full day without thinking about her at least once. We dated for 7 years - that's longer than plenty of marriages. It ended for a lot of reasons, but the primary one is that there came a time when we valued the relationship more than we valued each other - what I mean is that we didn't want to lose the relationship, so we started to hide shit from each other, be dishonest about what we wanted and needed at different times... Also, life is just a bitch sometimes. Timing is a bitch. Circumstance is a bitch.”

Ironically that made me feel better.  He's living his life of course, but he kept it real.

Best of luck to others on this journey of recovery.


**tl;dr**: Was together 7 years, broken up for 2, FINALLY hit the 30 day NC period. 




 I honestly wish more women were like this.

As a man I can tell you that most jobs suck.  You're not missing out on anything. 




 Last time I wore a suit in Vegas I felt overdressed.  But that's just me. 




 I'm a black guy and I hate the term African-American for that very reason. 




 Just being blatantly honest... You did this to yourself by continuing to be her friend and internalizing your feelings. You were better off just being honest  




 Me too. Sometimes I'm having a down moment and this subreddit puts things in perspective  




 Eh, this happens more often than people think. Just don't bring him back an std or get pregnant and pawn the baby off on your husband and I won't judge you.  




 thanks for the suggestion tho! 




 I was hoping for something with a more narrow focus. 




 Eh, that's too rant-like.  I'd like to coalesce with other males who share my issues... not gripe at the world in general. 




 sort of like /r/bigdickproblems  but different. 




 Oh ok. Thanks for the bg info! 




 Being drunk with firearms sounds like a bad combination anyway. 




 I'm sorry but what's the big deal about this? 




 While noble, people have been shot for doing this.  Tread lightly. 




 He clearly says TWO LANE highway though. 




 No!  Don't do it!  What would be the point?  What would you gain?

You're going to completely ruin anything you've gained from going NC if you do it.  From what you've said, it sounds like she gave you a BS reason for breaking up in the first place.

I'm telling you, if you do it you're only going to prolong your torture.  I could see if you guys were still friends but you're not even talking.  I've seen this go bad too many times.  The guys gives his ex a gift while secretly hoping it makes her happy and in the end she feels that the gift is pressure to get back with him and subsequently does something to hurt his feelings.  (whether on purpose or inadvertently)   




 What you're experiencing is normal.  But I have some bad news, it may not change.  The best thing you can do right now is focus on things you can control versus focusing on something you can't (your ex).

It's going to be tough, but hang in there.  You're very young.  I suggest you keep working on yourself and live your life. 




 As a black guy I could do everyone of these tips and it wouldn't matter.  My facial hair grows out like individual curly fries.   




 I agree.  I bought my first house at age 26 and lost $20k when I sold it three years later because I moved to take a promotion.  Luckily my company took half of my loss so it was manageable but I won't buy another house again until I feel I'm completely settled and married.

It makes no sense to own if you're not going to stay in the same spot for at least 5 years.  And I need to be flexible right now. 




 He was walking back to his father's house in that neighborhood.  But your use of the word "wandering" tells us where you stand on this issue.  Regardless, he didn't deserve to die. 




 Your post said nothing about intention.  You mentioned the result of being late as a consequence of traffic.  My point is that if your grandma was in the car and you were in traffic due to a regular accident you're still fucked. 




 A few things sir...

1.  Hispanic is not a race.  There are plenty of white Hispanics.
2.  Hundreds of trials may end the same way but this was the one that THE MEDIA blew up. Nobody has time to keep up with every trial.  Why are you surprised that this one got more outrage than a local case?
3.  There are plenty of protests for black on black crimes.  But once again the media doesn't cover it and posters like yourself aren't going to go look for them.  
4.  I don't know their rhyme or reason.  Honestly, these people stuck in traffic did nothing to Trayvon Martin so I agree with that. 




 What stereotypes would that be?  Oh you mean the one about protesting and blocking highways?  Not sure I've ever heard that one. 




 Wouldn't this still be applicable if traffic was held up for a regular car accident?

I'm not sure I see your point. 




 Walk by the people standing/sitting around watching the game, project your voice and say "Who's got next?"

If no one has it say, "Okay, I got next then."  Then you can also start asking people if they wanna play with you.

If someone has next then ask them if they have 5 people.  If they have a team ask who has next after them.  Wash. Rinse. Repeat 




 I'm in the wrong line of business... 




 I'm at the point now that I can only play simple games that don't require a high learning curve.

I also can't play RPGs because I'll get them started, play for a couple of months, not play them for a year, and try to pick them back up again only to spend an hour going "Where the hell am I supposed to go next?" and get discouraged and turn it off just to play a simple game. 




 Since she has her new boyfriend she already made her choice.

Respectfully tell her not to contact you any more.  It sucks but I know the feeling.

I just recently did this with my ex of 7 years.  It hurts like hell but you gotta have some self-respect at the end of the day and an ex contacting you with no intentions of reconciliation is just being selfish. 




 I know them feels.  *bro hug* 




 There's no right or wrong way to handle this.  You've expressed how you felt and now you can go forward knowing that you tried.

I just wanted to share my story with you.  What happens next and how you handle it will be the key part.  It can be the difference between suffering for the next few months or suffering for the next few years.

The reason that I said I wish I had never broken NC is because although it would have hurt, I would have eventually gotten over it and began the healing process much earlier.  Like I said, I'm better now but it's been two years since the breakup.  I should have moved on by now.

I wish the very best for you in the future.  




 I'm no expert but I've went through exactly what you did and while it feels good in the short term, that pain is waiting right around the corner.

Ultimately, contacting your ex doesn't lead to any answers.  Over time this will frustrate you even more.  Even if she did respond, unless it is to get back together you're still back where you started.

Breakups are probably one of the most complicated things a person will ever have to go through in life.  Things that make sense in normal situations make zero sense in a breakup.  I broke NC several times after being with someone for 7 years.  I eventually told myself that we could just be friends, but here I am 2 years later wishing that I NEVER broke NC.  Why?  Because nothing has changed.  I'm much better than I was before but I didn't get that closure I was seeking.  She never came back, even when I had that "Eureka!" moment similar to yourself. 




 Yeah, this looks safe. 




 Lies. 




 I don't agree with this tone.  The person comes off bitter and hateful.

How does this person know they will be around for the downfall?  What if it never happens?  Will they be miserable forever?

A better mentality is wishing the best for yourself instead of wishing the worst for someone else.  It is necessary to move on. 




 What's so awesome about this outfit? 




 Why don't they ever list the inseams as part of the sizes? 




 Really?  It's kind of late to be applying to the top schools when classes start in a few months.  I would think you would have applied by now and known your fate.
