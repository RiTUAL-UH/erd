 have full blown conversations with my cat. 




 the drama. with my guy friends we can just forget about life and do something fun. but with my girl friends its always "remember that bitch that did that thing 3 months ago? guess what happened this time".  




 I met her in 4th grade and she attacked me the first time she saw me. I was the first person who actually put up a fight and lasted a little while before we both fell on the floor and laughed. we soon found out that we are equally crazy and random and have almost identical interests. we are practically sisters now and we still have a strong relationship despite the fact that she moved out of state last summer.  




 my worst nightmare happened 3 years ago and I will never forget it. in my nightmare I had committed suicide. my body was dead but my spirit still lingered in the house. I remember watching as my body was taken from the bedroom and brought down to the morgue. I watched my funeral and I stayed as they buried me. But things started to change at home. I was no longer there for my mom to beat on so she turned toward my 7 year old sister. every day became endless torture watching her get hit and slapped and yelled at, knowing that I was powerless to save her. all i could do was hold her close and tell her that everything was going to be okay, even though I knew she couldnt hear or see me. I woke up crying and went over to hug my sister. I promised her that I would always be there for her no matter what.
