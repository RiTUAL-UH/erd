 Yeah I gave a vague medical reason why I had to take a leave of absence from my last job before I got laid off but my weight was so extremely low that I'm sure everyone knew why I was leaving. Now that I'm back to a healthy weight I'm really hoping I can pull through with a medical problem/caring for a family member excuse without raising too many eyebrows. I hate calling it an excuse since it really WAS necessary that I got help but you know what I mean. 




 It really does, thanks. It's just nice to know that I'm not alone and that other people understand what I'm going through.

I've been trying to start up my creative side again and do some writing and drawing projects, but I am terrible with self-motivation and I tend to get incredibly frustrated when I'm trying to wake my brain back up and get back to caring about things for their own sake. I'm trying really hard and I'm just at the point where I need to have just a little bit of expectation from someone other than my therapist to get me motivated. I'm going to keep at it though :)
