 You lucky bastard. 




 Just let her do it. It'll be worth it. For me.  




 The relief!!! 




 I can't stop laughing at this 




 Two....only two big ones? 




 ....I still think blankets are the safest bet against monsters and ghosts. 




 Of course not. On this subreddit? 




 Don't resist! Give in! 




 Show AND tell. Sweet. My health teacher made our class say 'penis' and 'vagina' over and over again until we didn't laugh. It didn't work. 




 Loved that game. 




 I think I appreciate videos like these more than other because it's an actual popping video, and not one of someone constantly wiping a cyst. 




 ....ingrown wig. 




 Those are the bestttttt 




 *cries impatiently* 




 ....which one? 




 You have to forgive yourself. Let go of the past and be there for Seth now. Don't be so hard on yourself, life is too short.
I know it's easier said than done, I understand your guilt, but being in the background is worse than being completely absent, because the only thing that's holding you back is fear. 




 You did more than you know by being there for her! I mean it. Divorce is so hard to go through, no matter what age, and you were a safe, positive, and happy environment for her. It is so important for young minds to recognize a place where they feel safe, and you gave that to her. Keep your head up!
