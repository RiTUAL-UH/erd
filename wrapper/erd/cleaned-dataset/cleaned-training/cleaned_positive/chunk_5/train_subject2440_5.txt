 Because it is a competition. Competition is a law of nature; it is an archetype. Also, in this monolithic capitalist monstrosity we call America, we are taught that success in economic competition equates to a higher social stature. If you are American, what you feel is completely normal.

It is difficult to maintain one's beliefs if they are in direct contradiction to everything that we know and are taught but to do so is the sole indicator of true individuality and that is something we are also taught to aspire to. 

Plus, it helps to align one's self with like-minded people; there is greater strength in numbers. 




 One on one went well, group didn't go well.

Gave up after trying just one group? Group helped me more than anything but it wasn't until the 3rd group that I found one that helped and it helped greatly.

I have huge problems with AA/12 step-type programs but among the few things they got right is this: you cannot help a substance abuser until the abuser hits bottom and wants to help himself. So go ahead and drive yourself down further if that's what it takes. But to some extent, we each get to choose our bottom; it is a choice.

I self-medicated for 40 years; just understand that you are self medicating (all substance abusers are).

What I would like to do, is go back in time ...

Alcohol will take you there and keep you there. You think you wasted time? Again, I wasted 40 years with self-medication. The only healthy choice is to move forward and alcohol will prevent you from ever moving forward.

But you already know all this.
