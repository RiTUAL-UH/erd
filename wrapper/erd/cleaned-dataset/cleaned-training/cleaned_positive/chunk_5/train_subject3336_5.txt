 Thank you so much for your comment :) It's so hard to suffer in silence, feeling like a freak and not normal. I never want anyone to feel the way that I did. You're right it is hard, that's why I want to help others not feel ashamed anymore. Hope you are having a good day xx 




 Wow thank you so much for such high praise!
