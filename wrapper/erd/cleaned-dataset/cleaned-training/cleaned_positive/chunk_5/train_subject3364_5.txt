 A beauty guru on youtube. She used to known as KaiKhaod/ForeverKailyn. People typically watch her to make fun of her.  




 She says it's normal but I would probably assume it's because she's obese. 
 




 Nope, still ever so present. She is now known as "MsKailynMarie" on Youtube and Instagram.  




 Here's the video the screenshot is from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYTYHeeLCl8

She talks about how she wants to wear thongs but the string just disappears under her stomach.  









 I have this too!! I thought I was the only one!  



















 Have you tried thrifting? You can definitely find a lot of cheap  fashionable clothing there! :)  




 I think you have a lot of potential if you lose weight, dress better  get new glasses (possibly contacts?). Also, I don't think the mohawk helps..  




 Is this your cat? This looks more than it was done with an app.
