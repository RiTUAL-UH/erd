 Whether you do or not that isn't the question. I used cocaine and was addicted for six months than I was on oxycodone and went to heroin. This stuff is no joke. If your willing to put your brother or yourselves futures at risk go ahead and keep doing it. Substances are all a lie. It took me years to finally realize that myself. Nothing wrong with having a addiction. As long as you keep it in the past and do good today. That is what matters. Try something new. I would suggest going to a meeting or getting a sponsor. I was about a year sober and I felt like I was still running I was angry at myself, selfish, and tons of self pity. Not worth the struggle. 




 15ish years Adderall, Lorazepam, Anti Deprassants

16 Drinking alcohol, with a little bit of adderall and lorazepam still in the picture.

17 Addicted to cocaine for about six months than became addicted to oxycodone

18 oxycodone harder to find, I try heroin don't like it the first two three times but with withdrawing and it cost less I kept using it

19 to 21 Heroin went up to a $200 dollar habit and one point

21 to 22 and a half I was sober

22ish I relapse and use two times

Been sober since 7/25/14

These are good estimates I made. 




 I moved to Boston from California in middle school. (Total difference culture in each city it was very hard for me to adjust at a young age) I saw my grandma in the hospital in a coma. I started getting panic attacks throughout the month and went to the doctor and I was diagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety. I was given adderall and anti depressants. I started abusing the adderall because the more I took the happier I felt it gave me a sense of purpose and made me feel normal. 




 Live your life being kind to others and love your family your whole world can change in a matter of minutes.
