 I tried pretty much every SSRI and tricyclical antidepressant in existence over the last years. Its hard to give you a full list because I know only the local names and frankly a lot I have already forgotten again. Unfortunately for me I never really had any major success with it. I am not knocking meds I know a lot of people where they really helped. Its hard to say how it would have been without the meds at the time of course, maybe it would have gotten even worse.

I never had any major side effects, I was on Venlafaxine a long time which killed my ability to get it up, which was annoying but not a big deal because I was never in a relationship anyways :) Other than that I never had any side effecets on any of the meds I tried.
