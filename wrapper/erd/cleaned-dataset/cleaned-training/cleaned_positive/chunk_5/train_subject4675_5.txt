 It's not like that, trust me.

 Alright, so I'm in highschool. I've been with this guy for a really long time, and even before that, he was my best friend since middle school. We have a pretty solid relationship for the most part- no trust issues, no fighting, etc. However, I have depression and anxiety, he has depression, and we both aren't in the best situations involving family. He has gotten really depressed, and because of the parent he's living with, he can't talk a lot outside of school, so we have gotten a bit distant. 

I am that type of person who has relationship anxiety and needs constant reassurance, which is not healthy whatsoever, and I am receiving help with that, however it is still hard to believe that he loves me, blah blah blah. So, him getting distant has been very difficult, especially since we have two friends (both girls) who's lives are just as wrecked as our's. He feels the need to take care of everyone, so he's trying to keep them, me, and himself up all at once. However that usually ends with me being ignored.. He says he doesn't want to ignore me, or make me feel like he doesn't care, he's just "stressed" and "doesn't want to have to choose" between who to help. He does this every time things get bad, and always bounces back (aka recognizes that I need him too). How do I stay okay with everything while he is having these issues? How can I help him? How can I stop needing reassurance in times like these?
 




 I'm 13. and I don't advertise my phone number anywhere, but it's not hard to get it. A man (who gave me his name but stupid me didn't remember it) called me from an unknown number stating he was from my local police deparrment (yes, he gave me my specific city) and that he needed to speak to my mother. I told him "If you are from the police department why don't you call my mom?" he said "I don't have her number, ma'am." I said "If you are from the police department, then there is no reason for you to have my number, however you should have her's. Please don't contact me again" and they hung up on me. Should I tell my mom? I'm really scared. This unknown caller called me earlier in the day as well, but I missed the call. What should I do? 




 My mom knows. None of what I write describes personal situations, just vague and metaphoric insights.  




 I'm a pretty young writer, but I still consider myself to be good. However, very little of what I write are stories. I mostly write about the world, and what's happening around me. Almost like a journal, yet not personal enough to be seen as one. I like to write about what it's like to have depression, anxiety, anorexia, etc. I like to try and give people an inside look of what it's like to suffer from these things, and I do it pretty well. I've won awards at school and such. Is this a good subreddit for me to share and get criticism?
