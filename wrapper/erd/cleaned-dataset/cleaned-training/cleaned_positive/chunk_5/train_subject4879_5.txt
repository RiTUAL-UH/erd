 "FOR GONDOR!!" 




 i am pretty out of shape. i was just hired for may 1st. what exercises should i do to get in shape for planting? i have assess to a gym, pool ect. 

thanks 









 could you expand a bit on the negative attitude towards rookies? how were rookies treated differently than veterans? 




 is there anything you still feel like you need to accomplish comedically, or have you reached your artistic goals?  




 is this a legitimate company? how do they treat rookie planters? anyone planted with them before? thanks 




 asteroids like this one are the reason the government always keeps a rag tag group of oil drillers on hand. All would be lost without the wisdom of Bruce Willis and co.  




 pretty sure thats what it means, either that or 6-8
