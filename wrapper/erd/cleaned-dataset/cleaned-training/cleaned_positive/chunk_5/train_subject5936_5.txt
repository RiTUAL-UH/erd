 I've struggled labelling my sexuality for a while now but I still feel very attached to the LGBT+ identifier. I know that some people choose not to have a label (and that's awesome) but I love words and I love having a feeling of identity- and LGBT+ subreddits have really helped. 
I just wanted to say that while I'm fairly new to reddit, I love all sexualities and genders and I think that the community here on reddit is amazing.

Much love to everyone and support in their struggles (as sometimes there are mean people). I love all you guys so much for inspiring to feel better about my "no-label" situation.

SUMMARY: I really appreciate having a community to make me feel less anyone and I just think that whatever you are (straight, gay, lesbian, pan, bi, trans, agender, bigender - and all the other ones that I can't remember or don't know about yet) you are awesome. 3
