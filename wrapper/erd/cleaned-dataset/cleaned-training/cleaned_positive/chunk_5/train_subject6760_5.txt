 This is the most profound movie question I have ever been posed with. I think all villains are color blind. 




 Good luck with that. As I mentioned, it's hard for me to do these "imaginary" things. But my therapist gave me a hint. She wants me to be aware of the "should," "have," "must," "always," "never," etc. That's easier. 




 Yes, keeping at it. Thanks for the support. :) Apart from antidepressants/antianxiety meds, I'm on mood stabilizers and low doses of antipsychotics. Just reading what I wrote seems a little too much. 




 I think this is where CBT kicks in. 




 Yes, it does make sense. I have had feedback, especially from my boyfriend about the same. But to get one level up above the subconscious and to have a voice tell "You are wrong, I'm not a bad person. Stop criticizing me so much!" is a little too much for me at the moment. 




 All the best, then. :) 




 It's sometimes hard for me to do imaginary tasks - e.g., the containment task in mindfulness is not easy for me. :) 




 I got a hard on just from feeling his passion about movie reviewing. 




 My therapist asked me to try and be an imaginary observer about how critical I'm about myself. She thinks that even if you can't stop being hyper-self-critical, being aware of it helps.

(PS: Is your name a Mick Foley reference?)
 




 Thanks. But does it help? 




 Not feeling negative could be considered as better. 




 I think I honestly enjoy my hobbies, but, like you, they may just be escapes. Who knows?
