 Seems legit.  









 Same here, picking/biting though.  




 I'm hungover and unable to detect sarcasm through reddit. Eh, I've found myself in solid rock a few times and like I said, I've been in firewater. My music taste is everything from heavy metal to 80s pop. So that's not exactly an issue.. ha..  




 I don't tend to venture into Sauchiehall street too much, been to firewater a few times but other than that I haven't been to the other clubs; I just know of them. The only thing that seems to be appealing to most people about campus is the prices. 

Might check out Victorias and the other you mentioned. Thanks!  




 The first and most appropriate use for that emoji 




 Haha I can safely say I, nor my friend have ever stolen a traffic cone.  




 Friend and I are contemplating campus tomorrow but I've heard mixed stuff about it. Any insight into it would be awesome/other recommendations. 




 Equally as awesome. Appreciate the effort too :) 




 That's awesome! Much appreciated :) 














 My therapist is aware, she's asked to see my arms (obviously, that was optional) if you do decide to tell them, he/she will probably ask you why you do or other questions. 

The only way they would ever have to take action was if it was endangering your life/you were threatening that. 




 I still cut, just not anywhere they would see. But I'm curious if anyone else is the same. I don't mind in public, but if I were to see anyone I know; I'd pull down my sleeves.
