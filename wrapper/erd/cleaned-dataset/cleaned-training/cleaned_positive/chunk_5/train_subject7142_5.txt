 Maybe you could start talking to some people online,being on social networks,video games stuff if you're into that,blogging,anything really. It's way easier than "getting yourself out there" in real life and it could lead you to make friends you have similar interests with. :)

 




 I'm fooling people into thinking I'm leading an happy and fulfilling life everyday,so yeah..you're not alone.

As for advice : did you talk to a professional about your migraines ? Finding a way to get rid of them could be a great relief for you already.
 




 Happy birthday    internet hugs OP ! 




 I understand what you're going through,I've been there. Right now the pain is very strong so the best you can do is anything that would keep your mind off of it. Something that helped me was time going by,I'm not gonna lie and say you won't feel bad anymore,but it will become less frequent,less intense... yeah. 

Do you remember some things that helped you go through life before you met her,if any ? Even the smallest thing. :)
