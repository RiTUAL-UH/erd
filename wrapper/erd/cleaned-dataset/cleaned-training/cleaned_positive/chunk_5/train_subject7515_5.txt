 Ours tossed a blade while crushing ice, shattering the glass container. Also it stained my pants poop 




 And these things are different how? 




 I never understood that. Wtf are they made out of? 




 I am. Tacos are like open ended burritos made out of razor blades. Burritos are so much easier to hold on to. Except if they aren't wrapped well they get soggy by the end 




 Last time I saw them it was:

Rodeo Ruby Love

Streetlight Manifesto

Reel Big Fish

Lost my coat and shoes in the circle pit, found them in the sound booth, made friends with some of the techs and got pulled over at 3am in Camden because my car matched the description of a stolen vehicle. Epic concert and fun times
