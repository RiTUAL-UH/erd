 You're so unhappy with yourself and your life that you've created delusions of grandeur to cope

Nah, I fell asleep at the wheel and I came to going 85MPH. I don't remember about half of a 20 mile drive. I didn't get any sleep that night because I had to bring my mom to the ER and tried to pull an all-nighter. Basically, shift started at 8AM, worked until 4:30PM. Got home, Mom called up at 11:30PM that her chest hurt, went to ER until 4:00AM. Got home and had to work at 8AM again. At the hospital, I had drank 6 cups of coffee with 42 packs of sugar and 30 creamers figuring I'd be up all night. Drove home, didn't sleep or eat. Was feeling a bit woozy, but had to go in to work or I'd get fired. Drove to work when it was light out. Next thing I remember I'm going 85MPH and it's dark out. Doesn't make sense as I wasn't scheduled before 8AM ever. 

That day at work everything was really fucked up. The entire part of the store I was responsible for was completely changed and kept changing after that. I had all the aisles memorized and pretty much knew where everything was - it was all moved around. Other people at work noticed it too, so I wasn't the only one. 

That night I came home and shit wasn't the way it was when I left. People were different. Items were out of place.  After that, items in the house began "moving." For a month after that everything was extremely strange and different.
