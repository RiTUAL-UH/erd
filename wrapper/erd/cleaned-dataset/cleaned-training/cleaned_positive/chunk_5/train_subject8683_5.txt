 That's it. Thanks. And again, thanks to ASCIIBear. Honestly, that was a hell of a moment too. 




 No, that's not the one. It was a different time, shortly after that, I think. But thanks though. 




 I think they were both WWE Champion (Punk leaving with the "real" title, and Cena holding the "fake" title he won against Rey Mysterio), and they were on adjacent turnbuckles.

CM Punk raised his title, and his music played.

Cena did the same, and his music immediately interrupted Punk's.

They did this back and forth at least three times each, I think. It was a cool moment, but I can't find video of it.

 I don't know if any of you guys get as immersed in kayfabe as I do, but I sometimes see things during a given show that make me ask "Why would this person do this, if we think in terms of kayfabe?"

For example, the fact that Triple H always covered the head of the sledgehammer with his hand when he used it as a weapon. Outside of kayfabe, it's obviously because (from what I hear) he uses a real sledgehammer 99% of the time, and he uses his hand to cushion the blow.

But it's still obvious that he does so to the viewer, so it might take away from the realism... unless you can think of a reason he would do it IN kayfabe. Like, maybe he covers the hammer itself so he can control it better, since a sledgehammer is actually pretty heavy.

Something like that. Using kayfabe to explain things that make sense in real life (where wrestling is choreographed), but don't appear to make sense in kayfabe (where wrestling is a legitimate sport).

The wiki could be set up as a Q A, where Wredditors can edit the wiki itself to either ask or answer a question like the above.

 I just used brackets to show which phrase I was inquiring about-- ah, excuse me. About which phrase I was inquiring. ... damnit, that was a dependent clause. Am I even allowed to start a sentence with "..."? SO MANY QUESTIONS.

:P

Anyways, which of the two bracketed phrases is correct? I'm leaning towards the first, since I think "second most" would be using "second" as an adverb to describe the adjective "most," whereas "second-most" is an adjectival phrase that would describe the noun "subscribers."

Or, on that note, I'm thinking maybe both could be considered correct? 




 Not an entire promo dedicated to it, but if he's cutting a promo, and the crowd starts chanting Goldberg's name, he could quip something along the lines of "[sarcastic laugh] Goldberg *wishes* he was as talented as I am." And then continue the promo.

Would there be controversy, even a little? 




 I always get caught off-guard when a woman gives me an extremely firm handshake. I never know whether or not to do so before the fact, since I'm worried about hurting her hand.

Although, to be fair, I've never heard anyone say "Ow" in response to a handshake, man or woman. 




 You made Mike Tyson retreat with just a handshake. You might be Jesus. 




 I'm so stealing this.

Now I need to find people willing to shake my hand. 




 Why not?

 Here is the exact version of the cooler that I own:

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834992522

It was working fine until recently, when it suddenly starting rumbling noticeably (I have it, and my laptop, on my bed, and was sitting next to it) and making a lot of noise. I opened it up to fix any problems that a tech dummy like me could find (dust, loose parts, etc.), and didn't find much of anything wrong.

The problem is persisting, however, and I can't figure out how to solve it. Any suggestions? 




 Agreed. It's very long, but it's not a run-on, and I don't see any grammatical errors or any incorrect syntax of any kind. 









 I don't know dick about the law, but I assume there'd be something to protect the employee in a situation like this:

* Employee: "Sorry I had to leave before my shift was over. I was severely sleep deprived and had to be hospitalized."

* Employer: "I don't want to have to do this, but we can't do anything for you at this point. You can pick up your final check on Friday."

* Employee: "You... you're firing me?"

* Employer: "I'm sorry, but I have no choice. I need someone who won't miss shifts or leave before completing a shift."

* Employee: "I ALMOST DIED, YOU SON OF A BITCH!"

* Employer: http://fuuu.us/18.png

There HAS to be a law against that. 




 Jesus Christ, dude. That is some grade-A work ethic. 




 Like others, I take a nap during the day after 4-6 hours of sleep at night. The only reason I really do this is because I like to stay up late AND wake up early. This is really the only way I could think to pull it off. I typically get to sleep around 1-3 AM and wake up at 6-8, then nap at around 12-1.

It doesn't feel any different than your typical 8-hour sleep cycle. I feel well rested each time I wake up, and I get to sleep pretty easily in both instances.

I've considered polyphasic sleep (because tbh, I really don't like sleeping), but I have insomnia from anxiety/depression, so I'd have to dope myself up on sleep aids multiple times a day. No, thanks. 




 Was it definitive that the reason he died was because of his consistent lack of sleep?

 I understand the concept of Buddhist principles, Nirvana all that good stuff, but I still definitely wouldn't say it's something to live by. 




 I'm sorry... but BULL. SHIT. Suffering is not a conscious decision that we can choose not to go through. Suffering is an emotional response to pain, and if it was simple enough as "I don't want to suffer-- therefore I will not," nobody would smoke pot or take anti-depressants.

Emotional pain is almost exactly the same as physical pain. When it hits you, you hurt. When you hurt, you react. That reaction is what suffering is.

  I went to therapy once they told me that this could be my baseline. That I will always be this way.

I say that therapist is a quack. There is no such thing as an untreatable level of depression. We can treat CANCER, for God's sake. I refuse to believe that anyone with depression, no matter how severe, cannot be helped significantly. 




 Apparently, CBT is supposed to help one cope with anxiety/depression/mood disorders/etc., and learn how to live a relatively normal life despite the condition(s).

From what I've read and/or heard, its general purpose is to teach one how to live WITH the condition(s) instead of eliminating it/them.

Right now, I'm losing a battle (and losing badly) between numerous anti-depressants and my anxiety/depression. Nothing's working. The only times I don't want to sob uncontrollably and crawl into a hole and never come out are when I'm sleeping. I rarely enjoy doing anything I normally like to do, so it's all but an impossibility for me to actually motivate myself to do something I *don't* want to do.

Point is, I can't possibly fathom living with this and not feeling psychologically crippled. Living a normal life where I don't neglect my own personal hygiene, sleep 16 hours a day, and spend all my free time alone in a two-story house, brooding in the basement with all the lights off since it's the only room that doesn't have windows.

Living with something that turned me into a prisoner of my own psyche is not something I can understand. It doesn't make sense and it doesn't seem possible-- as such, I feel like trying it would be a waste of time and money.

Could someone try to convince me otherwise? 









  Seeing D-Bry still lose his temper and attack Big Show, even though Big Show didn't want to fight, and watching him not understanding or accepting HBK's apology is still in line with this theory.

This is actually a really good point. I did find it odd that Bryan was acting like such a dick towards Big Show, backstage and in the ring, after it was announced that they had a match against one another.

But even if Bryan should actually be viewed as a heel, what does that make The Authority? Mega heel? 




  My question to you is this: why is it okay for Shawn to let his emotions get the better of him, but not Bryan?

It's not okay in the context of superkicking Bryan, but it's understandable in my opinion.

Bryan losing his cool and putting Michaels in the Yes Lock is less understandable because not only was he lashing out at the wrong person (Shawn isn't the one who's making Bryan's life a living Hell), but he essentially started the chain reaction during that moment.

1. Michaels politely and humbly asks Bryan to accept his apology, face-to-face, man-to-man

2. Bryan refuses without saying anything. We don't know if he's being a smart ass, or if he's just upset overall and not at Michaels. His lack of communication is key. Instead of just shaking his head, saying something probably would have helped. This is where the chain reaction of emotional turmoil begins.

3. Shawn Michaels lashes out verbally because he feels like Bryan is making a fool of him. No one else who cost Bryan the WWE Championship has done anything even close to apologizing, but Shawn felt like he was doing the right thing, and Bryan STILL acts rebellious when it probably wasn't called for.

4. Daniel Bryan lashes out physically, as I said (and I don't mean that sardonically), at the wrong person. Sure, Shawn said some things that maybe he didn't mean or at the very least shouldn't have said. But it appears that Michaels and Bryan are friends, or at the very least, have a close teacher/student relationship. It's not like Shawn is some random guy-- you'd think Bryan would have it in him to forgive him for everything from the superkick to the verbal tongue-lashing (which, again, was a result of Bryan's stubbornness). 




  to say that he humbled himself before Bryan, is, simply put, inaccurate.

The reason I agreed with HBK saying that he was humbling himself is because he was apologizing in front of millions of fans. Apologizing basically means "I was wrong. Please forgive me." Shawn Michaels is the legend of all legends. He could have attempted to save face, and not publicly admit that he significantly screwed up, by apologizing to Bryan in private, but he chose not to.

 He basically told Bryan that he was not an "A+ player" and that he was not good enough to be in the ring with Shawn. That is not humble.

He only said that to Bryan after he had become frustrated with his attitude. You can't blame him. Sure, maybe Triple H and Stephanie have it out for him. Maybe Randy Orton isn't the rightful WWE Champion. Maybe all of those people hate Daniel Bryan and want to make his life miserable. Sure. But Shawn Michaels is not one of those people. As I said, his actions weren't out of spite or hatred. It wasn't Michaels lashing out at Bryan with the superkick as much as it was defending Triple H. Shawn would have kicked the hell out of damn near ANYONE had they done that to Triple H in front of him.

He was torn between his student and (metaphorically) his brother. That's an easy choice to make if you ask me. 




 I feel like this woman was probably a fan of the saying "Do as I say, not as I do." 




 As I said in the title, everything below is in kayfabe, even some stuff that is part of kayfabe and real life (like Shawn Michaels' rocky relationship with the WWF in the late 90s). I'd really like it to stay that way, if you guys don't mind. Please, no responses along the lines of "Because that's what the writers came up with," etc.

Now, in my opinion, it's obvious here that amongst the four people in the title, Daniel Bryan is the face, while Triple H and Orton are clear heels, and Shawn Michaels appears to be on his way or has already turned heel.

Michaels' pseudo-heel turn is what interests me the most. Shawn Michaels and Triple H are best friends in kayfabe. They're as close as the closest of brothers. So when Shawn Michaels saw Daniel Bryan assault Triple H (perhaps having NOT seen Hunter shove Bryan halfway across the ring), he reacted on emotion and retaliated with some Sweet Chin Music.

At that point, he probably realized that the decision was not the best one he could have made, but he also realized something else that was very important-- **the match was still going on, and he promised the fans that there would be a WWE Champion by the time the match was over.**

Orton took advantage of Bryan being laid out from the superkick and pinned him immediately. Michaels knew he had to count Bryan down or else he would have had to live with himself as having lied to the fans (or being mistaken, but he probably would consider that as bad as a lie).

The next night on Raw, Michaels explained to Bryan that he superkicked him because he felt the need to defend his best friend. HBK even explained why he reacted the way he did-- during Shawn's "darkest days" (when nearly the entire locker room hated him, he had severe drug issues, and he was just, simply put, an asshole), Triple H was the only person by his side. That is **extremely significant.** That type of loyalty (that Triple H showed) is the type you repay til death. Michaels probably feels like he owes Hunter his life, so the least he could do is come to his defense when he gets the sucker-punch equivalent of a hard knee to the face.

This, in my opinion, doesn't *justify* Michaels' actions towards Bryan at the end of the match, but it makes them understandable. Shawn Michaels brought up an aspect of his past that he probably doesn't like to talk about, just so Bryan could understand why he did what he did. He apologized, and offered Bryan a handshake. He refused.

At that point, Michaels got frustrated, understandably (in my opinion). He was correct in saying that he, Daniel Bryan's trainer, a Hall-of-Famer, and possibly the greatest wrestler of all time, humbled himself on international television and asked for only a handshake in return.

Shawn even did this, which may be me looking too much into this, but I can't help it-- **he took the Lord's name in vain** when he used the phrase "For the love of God!" after his emotions had overflowed.

I've followed Shawn Michaels' career extremely closely since his return in 2002, and I don't think I've EVER heard him do that during a promo, interview, etc (on WWE television). Shawn Michaels is very religious and very *serious* about his religion-- I doubt that he would do something like that unless he was extremely passionate about what he said, and more importantly, unless he meant it to the fullest possible extent.

Bryan's response? A feigned handshake whose only purpose was to set Michaels up to be locked in an extremely painful submission hold. Again, seemed (to me) to be the equivalent of a "sucker punch." Michaels could not have seen it coming and had almost zero chance of defending himself before the hold was applied.

In my opinion, Michaels was right that Bryan was being self-righteous and not showing Michaels the respect he deserved. Shawn Michaels did NOT do what he did at Hell in a Cell out of animosity or hatred-- he had neither towards Bryan (if anything, the complete opposite). He did it because in defense of someone for whom he'd probably take a bullet without hesitation.

Daniel Bryan apparently can't/didn't understand that, or has more anger issues than we realized (which is saying a lot).

Thoughts? 









 I'm looking at you, "Snickers wrapper for a condom" people. 




 I assume the male lion watches over the other cubs who aren't being moved?

I don't know anything about lion culture :-( 




 That is the most adorable goddamned thing I've ever seen in my entire life. 




 Maybe I shouldn't have used that exact phrasing. But, when observing and honoring the dead, they have parties and parades and whatnot. A lot of people in other cultures probably couldn't even imagine that on a day dedicated to those who have passed away. 




 Right, I wasn't saying that you should be offended by El Dia De Los Muertos, but just look at how their viewpoint is so much different from the typical American viewpoint. Some people would be extremely freaked out that people would actually have a party (in stark contrast to somber funerals which are the norm here) on behalf of the deceased.

Maybe this is his first time dealing with the death of someone close to him, and he never thought about the things you're saying.

And honestly, I'm not trying to condemn you or anything. I'm actually extremely intrigued by the dichotomy of the two contrasting mindsets here. 




  He should really put his hands on it like a grown up.

If by "it," you mean "his mother's body," you should reconsider. That would be EXTREMELY difficult for a lot of people. Two of the three people I was ever closest to (my mother and my cousin) both passed away in the last ten years. Each funeral was open-casket, but I never went in for the viewing. I couldn't bear it. I'm not even squeamish-- it just would have devastated me emotionally.

Now, that's just from a visual perspective. Imagine having to actually make physical contact with the body of a person you once loved, knowing that now it's nothing but a lifeless cadaver. Its nature and its lifelessness represents the fact that you will never, ever speak to this person or have them speak to you again. It represents their suffering, your suffering, and the suffering of anyone who will miss her.

The human body also loses body heat during death, which I'm sure you know. Touching the body of a deceased person, and feeling cold instead of warmth, would probably feel extremely eerie, since when you make physical contact with a living person, you can feel the warmth of their body. It would be spooky.

Like I said in another comment, I agree with what you're saying, but I don't think it's necessarily as black-and-white as you're implying. 




 I understand that what he said may have offended you (hell, it offended me a little bit, and I'm generally not like that-- maybe it's because I lost my mother at 13), but it might not just be that he's a disrespectful dick by nature. Maybe that's how they feel in the culture he's from.

A good example is the culture of some Spanish-speaking countries. They celebrate a day called Dia De Los Muertos (The Day of the Dead). They *celebrate* death. They don't look at it with the stigma and negativity that we do in America.

I'm not saying the OP is in that boat exactly, but maybe he just grew up learning that a person and the body that holds them are two completely separate entities and should be treated as such.

I guess maybe it's kind of like when someone passes away, and you don't know what to do with their belongings. You probably have to give them away or throw them out eventually, and that's not really viewed as being as bad as what OP said. But he (or she, I'm honestly not sure) might look at it the same way-- that his mother's body is merely her own property, and once she's done using it, it no longer represents her.

Know what I mean? I hope I explained that well. I just feel like, while I agree with what you say, it would help to try to think of what his thought process might be and maybe it might be a little more logical than you first thought. 




 I also love how Cole, earlier in the match, filled us in that Big E can't win the title if he loses by countout.

Thank you, Cole. 




 I think you did. But I don't know if I did.

Did I?

 I like his character, but I just think he goes too far with it a lot of times. You can tell that JBL and Cole get into serious arguments about JBL not making sense or being biased, because Cole is annoyed.

Also, Cole sometimes has to talk over JBL to call the match. Color commentators don't call the match, but they're supposed to know when to shut up so the play-by-play commentator *can* call the match. 




 I agree that they can do whatever they like with their own life, but I wish suicidal people would have more faith in the fact that killing oneself is not the only way to end the pain.

 CBT = Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for those who don't know. I didn't know what it was until a week ago.

Anyway, I know that health care providers have a hotline, but I don't talk to anyone, so I generally don't even bother to buy minutes on my (pre-paid) phone. I'm not made of money as it is, so I try to save whenever I can.

Is there a website I can visit to find a CBT provider in my area that would be covered by my health insurance? I tried a Google search and couldn't find anything.

Thanks. 




 I think Account_Eliminator changed my original title (which was kinda long). I was gonna ask him about the name of the wiki being counterintuitive, but... I'm lazy.

 When you use the left click, Windows will decide for you whether it moves or copies, and sometimes, it doesn't choose the one you want, and you might not feel like going to the toolbar, selecting "Copy/Move to Folder," and then finding the destination you want.

Instead, just drag the file to another window exactly was you would with the left click, but use the right click this time. When you drag it and release the click, it will give you an option of "Copy Here," "Move Here," or "Create Shortcut Here."

Very handy, at least for me. I got sick of screaming "I DON'T WANT TO COPY IT, I WANT TO MOVE IT!" at my computer screen. 




 Isn't attempted suicide still technically considered a crime? I swear I heard that somewhere. 









 That's fair. I did want to make it clear that I don't know for sure, so I used the word "assume." People correcting me (no hard feelings to anyone) should realize that I'm not blind nor do I know anyone who is. So it was more or less an educated guess.

I can live with being wrong. 




 But those movies are actually professionally produced, aren't made up of 99% unrealistic dialogue, and are largely considered entertaining.

 I get the feeling the OP watched the first 30 minutes or so of the Daredevil movie from 2003. 




  Not everyone who loses their sight has always been blind.

But the customer in the comic says that he's been blind since birth. "Seeing" should be completely foreign to him, and I assume he wouldn't use the word often, if ever.

 Phew. I thought you guys were gonna come after me and break my kneecaps.

Seriously though, thanks for the heads-up. 




 I hope this type of post isn't against the rules. If it is, I apologize.

As for the Wiki, feel free to add to the list as you see fit-- adding/correcting listings, linking to videos of certain instances, etc. 









 It's definitely a thing. It's all a matter of where you live.

I hate when people say something "isn't a thing" just because it doesn't exist where they live. Your neighborhood isn't the entire planet. 




 I don't think he failed. Not being as popular in WWE as he was in WCW isn't a "failure."

He got more and more popular as time went on in WWE. The crowd was at least 50/50 against him at Backlash against The Rock, but then eventually he was very over. 




 An old wives' tale about how one could write something, print out a physical copy, and mail it to him/herself. This would allegedly be as good as an official copyright, and keep others from plagiarizing your work without ramifications.

 The "poor man's copyright" myth. 




 _ Since when does anything in wrestling work the way it would in real life?

If you even look at a referee wrong in the NBA, you're gonna get thrown out of a game. Meanwhile, in kayfabe, WWE officials fear for their lives every time a heel gets a near fall. 




 That's another really good one. Honestly, a lot of Last Man Standing matches have had brilliant strategical finishes. 




 For those who don't remember/don't feel like watching, Vince McMahon put a clause in a PPV-match contract which stated that Triple H and Austin could not have any physical contact with one another until they met at No Way Out, or the instigator would be suspended for six months.

After both men went over the contract and signed it, Triple H beat the piss out of Austin, and everybody (including JR and King) was confused as hell as Triple H eventually laid out Austin with a Pedigree.

When Vince told him that he had just gotten himself suspended, Triple H revealed that he had never signed the contract (but Austin *had* signed), and thus Triple H was not legally bound by the "No contact" clause. On top of THAT, the fact that Austin had already signed meant that he could not retaliate against Triple H for the assault without being suspended.

Even Vince McMahon, the consummate evil genius himself, couldn't help but smile when he realized what Triple H had pulled off. "Cerebral Assassin" indeed.

This all led to Stephanie getting a Stunner the next week, but still. _ 









 I think assaulting AJ would get him more pop than heat. 




  the fans on your laptop.

How do I do that?

 Also, bring up device manager, and see if there are any yellow triangles beside anything

Only something called "Broadcom USH." Says drivers aren't installed for it. 




 My laptop fans or the fans on my cooler?

* [Processor specs](http://2.imgland.net/VE9cpo.png)
* [Graphics card specs](http://2.imgland.net/9qTfmE.png)

As you can see, the graphics card (which, having researched, I believe is notorious for overheating) all but flame broils my motherboard. Sometimes I want to watch movies or sports games on my laptop, but I can't, because it'll overheat to the point that the CPU Usage skyrockets to 100, and the processor struggles to perform simple tasks (much less play a video) until it cools down.

It doesn't just happen with 720p HD or higher. It'll struggle with 540p, or even 360p sometimes.

I clean the vents regularly, I have a laptop cooler that definitely aids in lowering the temperature (having noted the differences between using it and not using it, each for weeks at a time), and I still have this problem.

Is there anything I can do to make it so that I at least have a chance of getting through the first half of a basketball game without my laptop exploding? 




 What medication was it, if you know, that caused the cancer? I'm taking Pentasa and Omeprazole right now, and I just recently stopped taking Prednisone (it's a steroid, so they don't want people taking it long-term). 




 As someone who has Crohn's Disease, you have now officially scared the shit out of me.

Pun intended. 




 You sure the nostalgia of a Heyman/Van Dam alliance wouldn't garner some cheers? 




 Ah, that's the incident when he arrived at the PPV high as all hell, I assume. 




 Elaborate for those of us who don't watch TNA? 




 There are places you can download it after it airs (and you can even download SmackDown before it airs). 




 Just for clarification, everything here is occurring in the present. Current Rob Van Dam in current WWE.

Give it your best shot, r/SquaredCircle. 




 Will this stop random question marks showing up whenever I c/p YouTube comments into an AIM IM box? 




 Ah, okay. I understand. 




 I just purchased an Xbox Live Gold 48-hour code on eBay, and (in case you aren't aware) not leaving positive feedback for excellent service is strongly discouraged.

I didn't leave feedback despite getting the code within minutes of buying it, because I hadn't used it, since I was waiting for a friend to get his own Gold subscription. I explained this to the seller, promised to leave positive feedback as soon as I used the code, and he gave me a free one to use while I wait for my friend.

People are awesome sometimes. 









  Nowadays, I don't know how much unhealthy foods prevent people from having kids

No, not necessarily that, but cases where an unhealthy diet causes a person to die before they're able to reproduce. 




 I tried searching, and couldn't find anything on this sub.

Couldn't our taste buds have "evolved" to prefer foods that are good for us (vegetables as opposed to chocolate, for example)? The laws of nature state that a species which chooses to damage itself consistently (or cannot avoid doing so) isn't fit to survive, right? Wouldn't enjoying the taste of healthy food help ensure our survival?

It seems similar to a situation where a zebra wandered regularly into an area where a bunch of lions roam, for no reason other than that it enjoys being in that area. Eventually, after a whole bunch of zebras get mauled, the other zebras would get the idea, wouldn't they? They'd stop going there, they'd keep their offspring from going there so the species can continue on, etc.

I'm no biology expert, so if I have anything wrong, please feel free to tell me exactly what. Just be nice. Please? 




 That's goddamn amazing. At that point, I might consider those people more family than friends. 




 :-( Nope. The relationship (we were never official) lasted about 4 minutes. _

Obviously exaggerating :P, but yeah. She didn't feel like I was worth committing to, partly I guess because she didn't think we were compatible, and also because she was an extremely studious pharmacology major.

I don't resent her for it at all. I'm just a little upset I lost her. She was my dream girl, and I got her number accidentally.

That's like a downer ending to a bad romance movie. 




 I posted this a while back, but I love telling the story:

I worked at an "information desk" in a big building (basically a study/eating area for students, and a meeting place for the top university employees-- managers, execs, etc.) on a college campus about three years ago.

One day, an attractive young lady around my age asked me where the cookie shop in the building is. I directed her to it, and she thanked me.

After she left, I realized I should have made a move, and I hated myself for not doing so.

Then, I saw her later that day. I waved to her. She waved back and smiled. I motioned for her to come to the desk.

I asked her, plain and simple, "Could I call you some time?" She said sure and gave me her phone number.

One day while we were chatting about a week later, I asked her what kind of cookie she went to get the first time I saw her. She had no idea what I was talking about.

**Because she wasn't the same girl I had seen initially.** 









 My fave, that I heard recently:

"I'll be damned if I repent." 









 "I'll lay you out over some beef like sesame seeds."- Chamillionaire 




 I love you for getting the reference. 




 That must get boring. 




 How do we know that's not some sort of super mutated giant pencil? HUH?! 




 Jake?! JAKE?! JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!

[Game Over] 




 Stop posting GIFs! You expect me to click on it?! That's tougher than looking before you sit! 




 _ At least if you don't look when you cross the street, a vehicle will usually stop before it hits you.

The toilet, however, gives approximately zero fucks. 




 And then even if I don't look, I check the seat with my hands (I know, gross-- I use soap when I'm done), and if I don't feel the seat, I don't sit.

There are lots of ways around this. You'd think women would be *better* at it since they always sit when they use the bathroom. 









 He was a face (I think-- I'm pretty sure he was still "The Viper"), and he was feuding with CM Punk. He came to the ring and the lights dimmed like they do for certain wrestlers' promos (The Rock, Kane, Undertaker, etc.). At that point, he cut a psychotic promo about, amongst other things, how CM Punk will sip his meals through a straw after Orton's done with him.

That's the only part I can distinctly remember. I'm also 99% sure it was on Raw. Does anyone have a link to the video of this promo?

Thanks. 




 The Celtics were terrible offensively and were almost just as bad defensively without Russell. I don't see how they could have possibly won without Russell unless there was a megastar in his place (and even then, they wouldn't win 11). 




 I assume that if people agree that Russell is GOAT-tier and Top 5/Top 3/whatever, they already know everything I'm going to post. 




 I wanted to know if people agree or not, and if they don't, I'd try to convince them.

Why the fuck would I waste 20 minutes composing a long post that (in the event that most people agreed with me) would essentially be saying "In my opinion, the sky is blue"? 




 The only reason I didn't write an entire CMV-like post is because I wasn't sure if it would be necessary, if people already agreed with me. 




 So if the rules change, you can't compare? That's just silly. Like I've said already, if you know enough about basketball, you'll know how to properly weigh the extenuating circumstances and judge a player properly relative to his era.

Russell played against worse teams/players, but accomplished things no one else ever will. Jordan's 6 Finals MVPs or five league MVPs or 10 straight scoring titles can or have been equaled/surpassed. I seriously doubt anyone is going to win 11 championship as the best player on his team, or have the type of defensive impact on the entire league that Russell did. 




 Enough what?

"Enough OP being open-minded and welcoming arguments and accepting that others feel differently"?

"Enough OP using facts to support his opinions"?

"Enough OP getting downvoted for no reason"? 




 Who the hell said you can't compare the games? I said I agree that they're NOT THE SAME.

Holy Jesus. 




 Have you seen the statistical defensive impact he had on the league, and more importantly, for his team?

Not only should the "In my opinion" fragment negate any thoughts of me thinking my argument is fact and indisputable, but if you look at the numbers, I'd say they favor "clearly has a case" more than not. 




 Make it clear for me? I just said that when you compare the 90s and the 60s, they're clearly not the same. When you COMPARE. I've also said, in many other comments, that it's very possible to compare across eras.

And I never said Russell was playing against "chumps." Again, I have said that he made Wilt Chamberlain look like a scrub compared to what the man was truly capable of.

Finally, Wilt Chamberlain was nowhere near Russell's level as a player. Only people who use stats and nothing else think that.
