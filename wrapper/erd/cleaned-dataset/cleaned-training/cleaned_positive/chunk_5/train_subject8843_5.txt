 Don't blame yourself for only being able to afford to rent one bed in a shared flat. A lot of this problem is due to the society around us and is not of your doing. In the UK in the 1960-1970's a single labourer could afford a house for their family. They may also have scrapped by but they had more than many do now. That is not your fault. Now it takes two good salaries to have the same as my parents generation did. Again, this is not your fault and being angry about it is only a natural and rational reaction. I and many others are also angry about this situation. So much so in fact, that in Scotland where I live we just had a referendum to leave the United Kingdom. 45% of people hate the situation so much that they no longer want the political union. To me it sounds a little like you are in that group but don't realise how many other people feel like you do. 

I had the same idea that women want that self-assured man with a good job. Many do but that is often because they can't see past the glossy images that the media sells them. Again this is not your fault. That however doesn't solve the issue of loneliness that maybe you have but it may help rationalise it. 

Meeting a good partner is hard and you may need to turn over many rocks to find the diamond. Your lack of experience could actually be a selling point. My partner is impossibly jealous at even the slightest hint that I had a past relentionship - regular arguments for 4 years. I actually think this is inbuilt into many people. That makes you a catch as any partner would not have anyone to be jealous of! I like Star Trek and in one episode the chief engineer says "Their is no roller-coaster as bad as marriage". I know it is impossible without the experience for you to make a good comparison but many people feel trapped in their relentionship. They would often like to be in the position you are - single; however that is only possible to really understand with the benefit of having been in a relentionship. 

When I was in your position I met a woman. After I got to know her she said I was literally shaking when I first met her and she thought it was cute. The relentionship didn't work out but it shows hows odd things can sometimes work in your favour.

"barely able to function in a world full of people doing adult things" - I think that adults only look like adults because they are taller than children. I think that people look different than how they feel. That means that other people see you as an adult even though you don't feel like one. In return you see them as adults even if they don't feel like one! The saying is "The only difference between men and boys is the size of their toys".

Many people don't know what they want and all you can do is try something and see if it fits you. 

 




 Nope, your not retarded. Your story shows that you can communicate well and as Followingtom says you are a hard worker and generous to your family. That is a quality to be proud of and a good woman will realise that.

It seems that you stayed so that you could talk to this girl. I am 44 but at your age I often tried to get to know girls in a similar, subtle way to you. In my experience it doesn't work. You need to ask them out. Maybe you can think of it as going out with a friend rather than a date. After all most good relationships between couples are actually just good friendships that eventually go a stage further. 

Once you know if she likes you then you are more in control of your life. If she doesn't then you wouldn't need to do the overtime any more. If she does then you can skip the overtime and spend time with her instead. 

I liked a girl and I was down the pub with her and a few friends when I was about your age. I loved her eyes and and while keeping my eyes firmly fixed on the TV due to embarrassment I said 'Wow - nice eyes!'. She thought I was talking about the TV and not her and I didn't have the courage to tell her - even more silly was that I knew she liked me! That was an opportunity missed and I never spoke to her again. I wonder what my life would have been life? My point here is make a decision to either ask her out or not. That way you won't have the regret of not trying.

Some people have rules that they won't ask a work colleague out as it could cause difficulties. That is fine as well. It will take guts to ask this girl out if that is what you want to do. You just need to decide how you want to play it. 

Maybe you could find some other activities as well. Do any of the sports centres have activities you could engage in? Maybe a local cycling group, board game group, martial arts, guitar lessons or even night classes. You may meet people there that you would make friends with and through them you could meet more people.  




 Having a pact with your friend sounds like a good idea. I like walking and often go on my own. I use the time to rant about all my problems and how much I hate other people. Can you still go on the walk and talk to yourself? I do it all the time. I imagine that I am talking to the people I know while I walk. I use their voice in my mind to keep the conversation going. If you do that then maybe you can tell your friend about it. You could tell your friend that you enjoyed the walk with them even though they weren't there. Maybe it will cheer them up and make them laugh - they can comment that it should be you in the psych ward and not them! It you make them laugh then you will have done something good. 

Regarding the problems interacting at the party, don't be to hard on yourself. I spent years with people who didn't like me. I wasn't very good at talking in groups bigger than 1 other person. I was good at the skill set that brought us all together though and I don't think they liked me for that while at the same time being socially unskilled. The point is that there will always be people who you don't get along with - that is their problem and not yours. It could also be that they are also struggling with something. 

My best advice regarding conversations is to speak your mind. I don't mean to say 'I want to kill myself' to a stranger. I find that in a conversation it goes like:

Person1: hey how are you?
You: Good you?
person1: I'm good

at this point your mind is either blank or you can only think of silly things to say. If your mind is blank then try to grab something, anything at all!

You: You look happy
Person1: Er ... lol, yea sure
You: How come?
Person1: It's a party and I get to drink!
You: Yea, drink helps me forget about work.
Person1: What do you do?

and there's your entry into a conversation. From nothing to something silly/embarrassing ('You look happy') to a personal conversation about what you do.

For me this was a difficult thing to learn. Conversing is a skill like any other. The person you spoke to ended up walking away anyway so what have you got to lose by saying something stupid? 

I hope that your friend gets better soon, and just because they aren't here doesn't mean you can't imagine talking to them while you walk. I also hope that I wasn't teaching you to 'suck eggs' with the conversation pointer. Apologies if so but then I figure that any conversation is better than none! 




 Try to remember that this is the hardest time of year for many of us. The expectations of being happy and enjoying the festivities can be over whelming. I don't know if it is true but someone told me recently that Christmas was the time of year with the highest suicide rates. If you can hang on a little longer then the festive 'fun' will be over and forgotten. I think there are more people feeling the way you do that you realise, they just don't say it. I hate this time of year myself and also struggle with it.

So many people say New Year is time for a new start. It isn't. It is just another day in a continuum but with added pressure forcing us to show pretend happiness. I expect that most of the people filled with joy are actually pretending. They will get back to their reality shortly and the forced pressure to enjoy this time of year will be gone. Maybe that will ease your burden a little if you can hang on for just a while longer. 

I don't know what country you are in but organisations in the UK like the Samaritans are trained to listen. Even if you just phone such a group and hang up without speaking you can look at that as a first step and congratulate yourself that you have done something very difficult. If you can say hello to them, even better! They will probably start the conversation with you. Don't worry about making a mess of such a call, they are not there to judge you and they exist only to listen to people who are desperate. The Samaritans are volunteers and are there because they want to help. You won't be putting them out or wasting their time. 




 I used to when I was younger but it has changed now. For me the problem with living at night was that it was impossible to hold down a job in my area of expertise. This is the reason that I am always trying to sleep only at night.

I also found it also makes having friends difficult as they are on a different schedule. I found that it also gets very lonely (and sometimes cold if you can't afford heating) at night when there is no-one else about.

I haven't managed to succeed yet but I try to stay in a 'normal' routine now. Sometimes I get lucky and can hold it for a month or so before it it gets difficult. I then have to 'reset' things to a 'normal' pattern which is very annoying and sometimes difficult.  




 I was 27 when I first went to the doctor and I also agree with the others. 

You need to tell the doctor the truth about what you are going through or it will reduce the changes of getting good help. It is difficult and embarrassing to talk to a complete stranger but remember that they are trained to give support to people in your position or refer you to someone that can. You are not the first to go to the doctors and discuss such issues and hopefully the doctor will understand that you are struggling. I would expect that doctors have learned to be non-judgemental of their patients so try not to worry about what they think of you. I have been in tears in the doctors office before now when I was finding things difficult but that doesn't matter to me now. If they don't try to help you then it doesn't matter what they think as they are a bad doctor, if they do help you then it won't matter that you were embarrassed. Maybe you would find taking a friend with you who understands a little about what you are going through useful. 

If you have the energy then I would also advise reading up on how others have tried to help themselves. The doctor will do their best but in the end you are the one who is most interested in getting better. Personally I find that high dosages of magnesium are often helpful in elevating my mood. I have a theory as to why here http://goo.gl/C0nbY3 (increases neurons and the binding strength between those neurons and serotonin). It isn't 100% effective but it seems to help significantly.

I am also using L-Tryptophan (serotonin facilitator) and I am experimenting with CBD (Cannabidiol). They are all available from health food stores and Amazon.

Regarding meeting new friends then maybe there is a local activity group that you could join? meetup.com is the website that I use and it allows me to physically meet people who have similar interests. In fact without that site I would have no friends. 
 




 I agree with mylittletarget. 

Don't beat yourself up to much about what you can't do. Give yourself permission to take time out for yourself. Give yourself the time to begin to get better even if progress is very slow. I just took two months off and am just today starting to think about getting back into my usual routine - you aren't alone in feeling the way you do even though it sucks to be there right now. Sometimes life will throw you a curve-ball and all you can do is go with the flow. Don't compare yourself to others because they probably don't have your problems. 

If this is a recurring issue then think back to the times this happened before. Realise that eventually things did get better last time and maybe they will this time as well. 

Maybe try to give yourself only one task a day or even every other day. Maybe it is going to the shops, doing the laundry or even just having a shave/wash. These things can seem like mountains at times. When going up a mountain it is best to go slow in order to conserve the energy you have. Give yourself permission to treat yourself if you can, a double treat if you accomplish your task for the day - maybe an extra chocolate bar without feeling guilty.

I am being presumptuous but it sounds like maybe your were raised by foster carers. Could you find a forum and read about how others have coped with the issues you are having? Knowing that you are not the only person who has faced this problem can be a useful perspective to have. Maybe finding people who discuss similar issues to yours can be one of your tasks for the day.

Good luck. 




 Thanks for all of the great replies. There is a lot more to mining that I had initially anticipated and your answers have helped clear my head. It is much appreciated. 




 Thanks for the reply Scrapper89.

When I first started looking into this the DRK calculator was giving returns of about 300 coins annually. The last few days it has been suggesting returns of about 190.

As I could pick up 150DRK for about £1,000 and that is the same as the cost of the rig then the trouble to set it up should be for fun and learning rather than profit.

Increasing the block reward from 5 to 12 increases the annual return from 190DRK to 458DRK. That return would certainly make it worth the effort. However:

http://drk.poolhash.org/graph.html

Suggests that the average reward to date looks like 8-ish. With a 7% block reward reduction occurring in 9 months (?) time I assume I could expect the reward to be down to about 4. If so then that gives a reward average over the next 9 months of about 6. For the rig I am thinking about then that would return about 175DRK over the next 9 months - and then a serious decline. Have I got that right?
