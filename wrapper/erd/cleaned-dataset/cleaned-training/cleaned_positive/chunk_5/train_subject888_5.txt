My father is a retired physician (cardiologist) and I must say that having some of the "most accurate" knowledge of Western medicine at one's fingertips is not always such a blessing.

If anything, the few psychotropic drugs I have tried—zoloft (sertraline), celexa (citalopram), and effexor (venlafaxine)—have done nothing but worsen my apathy and general desire to stop living.
