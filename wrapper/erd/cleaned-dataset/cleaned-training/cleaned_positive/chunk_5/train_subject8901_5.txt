 The scissor scene at the end is what got me 




 Das the stuff maine, das de stuff 




 I think its totally legit dood 




 I might sound stupid, but Le Interieur (probable typo there) really got me, I wasn't scared but I had this gut wrenching feeling after I watched it.

Also A Serbian film, sweet baby Jesus was that creepy 




 Oh yes, that scene haunted me for quite a time, after watching it I had the most unsettling drive back to my apartment. 




 Nailed it, Dany is quite unlikable because she gets what she wants because of Dragons and hot male fighters who are willing to do anything for her.

 




 lol, sorry im not a movie critic 




 I didn't like it at all! It wasnt a good remake IMHO and it was dumb, quarantin 2 was even worse.

Then again everyone is entitled to like different things  




 Ahhh, I was confused then since the two movies happen in the same exact building 




 Arent you supposed to be studying Sam?  




 Wat
