 Honestly I'm not even sure why companies would want to do this.  People aren't stupid, and if customers feel like they're being ripped off or cheated then they're less likely to want to support a company in the future.  And if they aren't doing something shady, there are ways to correct misinformation that *don't* feel like a coverup.  The "coincidental price increase because leaving early access" games have handled this pretty well.  The ones that haven't, though - illegal or not, it just seems dumb, from a customer respect/trust standpoint.
