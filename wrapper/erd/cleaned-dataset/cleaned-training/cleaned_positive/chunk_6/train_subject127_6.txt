 I usually never cry in front of other people, but these past few weeks I've had random crying phases that pop up several times a day, and they have been really confusing and frustrating. However, recently (and I think it's due to the meds I'm on) I had a really bad breakdown right in front of my boyfriend. I know I didn't make sense but I couldn't stop crying. At that moment in time I really wanted the whole world to just end. But what hurt me the most is that he started yelling at me too, and kept on saying "I don't understand you" and "What do you want from me" and "I give up". I was on the floor and he was all the way across the room. At that moment I wanted him to just be close to me and maybe let me know I wasn't completely alone. I realize now that this is just me wanting something and not considering what the other person is feeling, but now I don't know how to face him. One, because I am completely mortified by how much I cried and babbled. Two, because I can't help but feel hurt by how he got angry at me, even though on multiple occasions I have tried to tell him what is wrong with me, and what happens to me recently. He always avoids conversation about my depression, saying "don't think about it, if you think about it, it won't go away". I know it's probably annoying to hear someone talk about being depressed, but I thought he would at least try for me (we have been going out for some time). I don't know what to do, please help me out.
