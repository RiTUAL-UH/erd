  we tell the race baiters and the white guilt crowd to sit down. Segregating people and creating different rules by the color of their skin has never in the history of mankind produced a favorable result.

It's the best explanation I've read on it.  I'm sorry you don't agree and want to ignore history but the fact remains that it isn't so simple. 




 After seeing the picture, I personally don't think it's a big deal, but I won't speak for the rest of my race (i'm black).  I think a large part of the issue is that it is a slippery slope and the last thing black people want is for someone to keep pushing the envelope until you wind up with full-on black face. 




 Just because you don't agree with it and it isn't relevant to you doesn't mean that it is not extremely offensive to a group of people.  We're not as far removed from our racist past as you think.  The Civil Rights movement was only 50 years ago. 




 Look up the history of "black face" and minstrel shows and you'll understand why.  There isn't any history for dressing up in "white face" that is associated bigotry and racial intolerance. 




 Does this actually work?  I used to do it when I was bored in class but it seemed like you needed a good 20,000 hours to build permanence. 




 Never been.  My gf thinks we should order these trolley tours ahead of time to save money.

Weekend trip.  My goal is to see all the landmarks I can and get a feel for the city nightlife. 









 Wow that sucks... but hey, that's the risk you take being a bartender right? 




 Proof? 




 I was in the same boat and went to a top engineering school. Make sure your degree has value. Now I'm living a great life and inspiring others in my family to do the same. I'm never going back to the hood!  




 Reason #1 I got off anti-depressants.   




 Can link us to the exact model?  I'm thinking about getting something similar but there are a lot of options. 




 I don't get his answer.

¯\_(⊙︿⊙)_/¯ 




 Oops.  Good point! 




 So blunt yet so true.   I do kind of chuckle when I see all these posts from people under 25 lamenting about losing the love of their lives.  But then I realize they have limited perspective and it's all they know.   




 Fool me once.... well you know the rest.  Sorry to hear that.  At least she told you before you moved down there. 




 Why'd you guys break up?  Who dumped who?

On the surface it seems like she's trying to have her cake and eat it too.  She enjoys the comfort and familiarity you bring but doesn't want to commit.  Tread carefully because she could keep you around until she finds someone else and then kick you to the curb for good. 




 First major breakup?  Sorry to hear that.  Here's a bro hug.

It's tough, I know how you feel.  I've been there.

Use this time for self-reflection and ask yourself why this girl has defined your life.  

I'll share this quote from /u/Granite-M

 Nothing you say can touch the other person, because she has already taken herself out of the relationship and will not allow herself to be moved or empathetically affected by what you say. Her need to maintain a sense of goodness and righteousness, and her intolerance for feeling guilty and vulnerable, makes such a person unavailable for a genuine and authentic exchange. **Nothing you can do or say will ever really reach her.**
 




 This. 




 The trouble with "love" as portrayed in Western society is that it is not this 24/7 feeling of bliss most people think it is.  Most of the time you really like that person.  Other times the feeling isn't as strong.

The problem with chasing that feeling, especially for a girl your age, is that you could end up worse off than you are now.  I've known girls who have perpetually chased this feeling and are now in their mid-30s and full of regret.  They wished that they'd stayed with their "boring" ex.

But don't get me wrong, if the feeling isn't there don't force it and settle.  Just understand the risk.

EDIT:  Replace girl with guy.  Advice still applies.  




 Normal feelings... No matter which way you go you ARE going to wonder what would have happened if you did the alternative.  I was in a similar situation, here's my advice.

1.  If you leave, then you will be very sad and miss her.  Even if things weren't perfect, as human beings we get accustomed to companionship.  Unless you've completely checked out mentally it will be very hard to walk away and not feel absolutely miserable.

2.  If you stay, then you will continue to feel like you do now.  Every now and then it will go away but there will be times where you continue to question if she's "the one."  The pressure will continue to mount until you get married.

PRO TIP:  There's no such thing as the one.  So let go of that concept.

Ultimately, the decision is up to you.  I wound up leaving my girl.  I regret it but I also know we would have eventually broken up anyway.    Good luck with whatever you decide to do.  8 years is a long time to throw away.  But if you can't see it working out then you know what you have to do. 




 I'm afraid this is going to happen to my ex gf.  She's doing a science based pHd and was supposed to be done by now.  Her graduation date keeps getting pushed back. It ultimately led to the termination of our relationship. 




 As a part-time sociopath I want to say that I respect your husband's diligence and you should definitely be worried.  He's probably not dangerous but definitely hiding something.  




 I'm sure winning the Slam Dunk contest has made his life somewhat different.  No? 




 My name is unique but I've always wondered how life would be I were a "John Smith" or "Michael Johnson" 




 LOL.  What the hell?  Should I feel proud or scared? 




 How automatic transmissions work.  No matter how much I read about it, it still seems like magic. 




 Wow, I've never seen the full version of this gif until now. 




 So you boycotted an entire organization because you don't like a player who coincidentally paid his debt to society AND who ironically does more for animal rights now than most people.

Gotcha.   




 Unfortunately the only answer is time.  To make the process go easier you should definitely keep your mind occupied.  The only thing to speed up the process is if you meet another girl who is better than your ex in every way (makes it easier to get over her).

No Contact is up to you.  I personally think it's good to get your mind straight but I disagree with it as a "one size fits all" solution to breakups.  Just know that it doesn't answer anything and you will still think about her from time to time. 




 I dumped her and felt like shit for 6 months.  I was juggling the guilt of her feelings combined with my issues of co-dependency.  It was a very tough winter.

But it was the most mature decision I've ever made and we're both better off for it.  I felt relieved because I no longer had to live a lie and I was being honest with myself for once.  But let me be clear, it was NOT easy.  




 Am I the only one who sees the [TROLL](http://whitsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Troll_Face.png) face in this pic?   




 I'm lost.  how did nobody find out you let him go? 




 Let's be honest, you don't want to dump her because YOU don't want to feel bad.  The rest is BS.  And this is coming from someone who has been in your exact position before. 




 This x1000.  This meme reads like the OP is not in touch with the reality of his own marriage.

What she did was wrong but the wording in the meme lends me to believe OP missed some signs.  I could be wrong however. 




 I really doubt she was happily married if she had an affair.  I'm just saying. 




 Wow.  Powerful posting.  I may steal this and put it on my Facebook wall.  




 Thanks for sharing this.  I liked it so much I didn't mind taking the survey afterwards. 




 some of us don't want sound.  the last thing I need at work is for these gifs to have sound. 




 No one here will be able to tell you. There are a lot of factors that go into getting accepted. The fact that you're a female and have a high GMAT score bodes well for you though  




 Makes sense. It blows my mind that some of these MBA programs accept folks right out of college anyway. Having work experience will make you a better manager as well 




 I keep telling myself that if I had a greater purpose or something to really worry about (like a kid) then I wouldn't get so caught up in my depressed feelings.  I feel like I'd be more focused as well.

But then I feel like it might actually get worse because I know depressed people with kids. Any thoughts? 




 They'll still lose.  The country's demographics are changing and the last two elections prove it.  People like the ones in your family will either continue to vote for the losing candidate, not vote at all, or get angry enough to elicit change on their preferred side. 




 This.  That's the only problem I have with this mantra.  You need to have some level of concern for your future.  Obviously you don't need to obsess over it, but you can't live life not thinking about your future at all.
 




 I guffawed. 




 Thanks.  The omission of this little detail is what had me confused. 




 All you CAN do is give it time.  Everything else is out of your control. I truly started feeling better when I let go of the need to control everything.  But keep in mind that it took two years.  So I know it's not easy.  I'm still worried about having a breakdown any day but so far so good! 




 It has been on my spirit recently to share some words with you all.

As some of you know, I have been on a journey of heartbreak and recovery for two years now.  I have tried just about every method out there and even purchased some e-books from so-called relationship gurus about *“How to win your ex back”*.  (I admit, I am ashamed of this)

I have done it all.  I’ve tried NC.  I’ve broken NC.  Being friends, not being friends.  You name it.

Here’s the conclusion I’ve come to:


**THERE’S NO FORMULA FOR HANDLING A BREAKUP!**



Wait let me repeat that with slightly better diction….

**THERE IS NO FORMULA FOR HANDLING A BREAKUP!**


Case in point.  Last night, my ex of 7 years texted me wanting to catch up.  We were at a period of about 50 days no contact.  I asked all my close friends what I should do an ultimately settled on talking to her under one condition:  I would express how I felt.

You see, I haven’t been honest with myself.  I’ve been very passive aggressive.  I’ve sat and let all the hurt and pain stew in my heart.  I did this because I believed that I was hurting her as well (this is true).  I did it hoping deep down that maybe she’d realize the error of her ways, call me up, and want to get back together.

In reality this doesn’t work.  The main reason being that nobody has ever wanted to be with another person due to guilt.

But onto the phone call… It started pretty innocently.  We chatted about TV shows before she asked me how my anxiety was going.  I took this opportunity to express how I felt.  I told her that she hurt me and had been continuing to hurt me with her actions.  I gave concrete examples.  She started crying, offered no explanation, and merely said she was sorry.

This launched us into a debate about the past that I did not want to get into.  I merely wanted to talk about actions that happened post breakup, not shit that happened 5 years ago.  Nonetheless, it happened.  And as usual, no consensus was formed.

At the end of it all, tears were shed on both sides.  I did not get the answers I was seeking, and I will admit that it hurt.  BUT I was able to get my emotions off my chest and I was able to realize that the person I had been holding these conflicting feelings against was human.

Most importantly I realized that I needed to let it go.  I needed to forgive her.  I needed to forgive myself… and I needed to move on.  No more games, no more tactics from relationship gurus.  Just an honest conversation between two people who shared some great times and some bad times for 7 years.  

In summary,  I know I broke a lot of rules… But I don’t care.  This was something I had to do for ME.  A lot of times people do things hoping to make the other person mad or jealous.  That’s not the way to go.  There’s no formula to this thing.  Be honest with yourself and who you are and start from there.  Come to terms with the fact that you may not get the desired outcome.  Come to terms with the fact that the other person may not be thinking of you.  Let go of that need inside you to control your outcome.  And if all else fails, chalk it up as a learning experience and live life.  You owe it to yourself.

Even with everything I said above, depending on your situation, it may not apply.  That’s the point of this post.  No one can tell you how to handle your situation.  Everybody is different.  Personally, me and my ex ended due to factors outside our control.  The fact that there was no “major incident” is what kept me holding on.

***
TLDR:  Each situation is different and there is no “one size fits all” solution to a break up.  If you need guidance, start by respecting and loving yourself. 




 sauce? 




 Be happy.  She taught you the necessity of pretending to do work.  It pays off later in life.
