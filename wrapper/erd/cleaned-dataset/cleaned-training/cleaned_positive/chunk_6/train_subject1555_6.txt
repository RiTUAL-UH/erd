 the fact that I come up with things in my head that seem amazing but I can never put those thoughts into words. or when i try and put them into words it makes me sound like I need to be commited to a mental institute.  




 I took full contact martial arts for a few years in junior high, so of course there were the tournaments that I had. but aside from that, I have only gotten into one fight and it was during my freshman year of high school. Well, I became friends with the guy who sat next to me in science class (lets call him J) and his girlfriend (lets call her biotch) wasnt too pleased with that. Now, I usually don't tell people about my birthday, but J somehow found out about it and decided to get me a little gift. I really appreciated just the fact that he cared enough to even wish me a happy birthday and gave him a hug. that was i guess the last straw for biotch because the very next day I was greeted with an uppercut to the jaw. after a few more punches and the realization that she wasnt going to just give up soon, I ended it. I left that fight with a busted lip and a huge bruise on my side. she left that fight with a dislocated shoulder and a bloody nose. we both ended up having a detention and sessions with the school counselor. gotta love teenagers, right? 

TL;DR: typical teenage "stay away from my man" cat fight only I had taken full contact martial arts for three years prior to this and she was just blindly throwing punches.  




 no one because I probably would have been burned at the stake a long time ago
