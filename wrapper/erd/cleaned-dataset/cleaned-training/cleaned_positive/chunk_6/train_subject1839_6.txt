 Thanks! This is my first time having to ever re-enter the workforce. I'd always had a job since I was 16 and not knowing what is acceptable plus being ashamed of my depression had been hard to manage but this makes me feel much less anxious about explaining away my little sabbatical. Next step is feeling confident enough in myself to feel like I can actually perform a job- I'm hoping this comes with some more time and work in therapy. 




 Also, if I'm not too intrusive, do you have any insight into your process of getting back into the workplace? Job applications are my first hurdle but I'm worried about how I'm going to manage easing myself back into the workplace without giving myself too much culture shock.
