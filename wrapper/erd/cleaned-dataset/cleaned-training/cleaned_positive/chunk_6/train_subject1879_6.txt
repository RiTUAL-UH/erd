 As I was getting over a heart break, a song appeared in my head and I can't for the life of me remember what it is or where it came from. I'm imagining a male's voice, like a singer/songwriter maybe, singing "you don't ever want to see me again, so you won't." Theres a chance it could be "I don't ever want to see you again, so I won't" My google searches came up empty. Anything? At some point I found a John Mayer song with similar lyrics but that wasn't it.  




 Lol I told her my cousin was pregnant and was moving in with our family and I had to be around to help. None of that was real life.  




 Mmmm no haha. Screenshot before the swiping!  




 The best way I can describe it is it feels like you are drowning underwater and you look around and everyone is breathing fine.  




 That sounds awesome  




 I'm 21f from nj, also diagnosed with depression. Hearing a males point of view on it would be pretty neat I think.  




 Oh my god. That didn't even cross my mind
