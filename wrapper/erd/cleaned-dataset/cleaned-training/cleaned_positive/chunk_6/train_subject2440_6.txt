 Yea, slip back but not all the way. enough for much discomfort without a fear of a complete crash (so far). 

But many other things this doc has said (and not said, as in shoulders shrugged when a response was clearly mandatory) make me want to drop this doc. I really hate changing doctors but this is just kind of the limit.

Doc just prescribes meds (no counseling) but sees fit to make discouraging comments about my present state and future prospects when that is the last thing a depressed person needs to hear. 

Time to move on to a different doc.

Thanks. 




 Mostly seems to stem from the fact that antidepressants lose much -- but not all of their effectiveness on me within a few months. I've never had anything that could remotely be considered a manic episode in my life -- not even close.

Edit: okay just looked at symptoms of "hypomania", too. Extreme stretch only in that I can be competitive but not even overtly. As for the rest ...

decreased need for sleep, are extremely outgoing and competitive, and have a great deal of energy. 

..not even close.
