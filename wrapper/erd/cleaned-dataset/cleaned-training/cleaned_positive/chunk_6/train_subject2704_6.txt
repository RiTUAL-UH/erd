 I posted earlier, but i finally figured out how to actually post a picture in the comments hah. so here it is. [TATTOO](http://i.imgur.com/ru8HngC.jpg) 




 I have one that says "the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" surrounded with a golden snitch. Not sure it's unusual but it's certainly not common. My quote anyway.. Edit i plan on adding to it as well c: 




 Caron simply soft.  6oz, medium (4) on a 16 round needle 




 For reference i knitted this scarf in the round and added the tasles at the end to close up the giant tube.  Double thick and looks nicer imo.   




 My sister loves pink so thus the hurt your eyes neon.  Hah. I have made lots of scarves with this small yarn in the past. Harry Potter house themed.  Currently working on a ravenclaw one actually. It is rather tedious though.  But the result is amazing c: 









 This happened to me at work. A coworker (that i dont like really) has asked me numerous times to knit her mittens.  I just stand there and dont say anything.  I would never knit anyone anythjng unless I'm at least their friend.  It takes so much time to do anything. Especially for me since I've only knit 2 scarves, and working on a 3rd for my sisters xmas gift..   




 Amazing! Thay would be awesome!  




 I was hoping they would release a 3ds xl special for mm.  Even tho i have a xl 3ds already cause that would be epic 









 That's really beautiful  




 I'm in Ontario haha,  scraped the frost off my seat and went hah  




 Yeah i work night shift.  It wasnt that bad going to work, but home the weather said it would be plus 2. They lied lol i froze yeppp 









 I am the same height.  I moved from a ninja 250 to a ninja ZX6R 2008 this year. I didn't lower it and i can manage just fine.  Again im 5ft 2' and a small lady.  Don't let size limit yourself!  




 Cool c: maybe I'll see you around sometime
