 I understand, I am the most awkward person sociable I hate talking to people I don't know and my heart was thumping out my chest last week when I was getting ready to speak. No one judged me no one gave me dirty looks, the room was silent and understood what I was going through that day. Last week I was full of rage and now I've never been at such peace with myself. Fear is what we need to overcome I wish you luck brother. No rush take it one step at a time. You definitely took the right step speaking about it on here it takes courage. Your on the right path. 




 Alanon is very helpful. I know alot of people who go. I suggest going and talking and figuring out what is next for her path to recovery. Goodluck! 




 Hi there,

I think you should go to some meetings and speak. I did that last week and it totally changed my mind on everything I was going through. Listen to what others are saying and going through it will shed light on your situation. Whether its a newly sober person struggling. It will remind you how good you are doing and that you do not want to go to that dark place ever again. 




 Find sober friends. Read books on recovery. Stay humble. Help others. Go out of your way to do that it will really help.
