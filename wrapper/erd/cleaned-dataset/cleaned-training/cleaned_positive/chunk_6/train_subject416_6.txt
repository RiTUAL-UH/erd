 I honestly don't really know ... I tried so many times, telling myself "starting tomrrow you will get up in the morning, shower every day, whatever", it never worked for longer than a couple days. This time it was just much easier, I put a lot of effort into cleaning myself up, my rooms, and so on. I tried to obsess less about what I am supposed to do with my life and how I have messed everything up and focus more on the little things that I managed to improve and how I really wanted my life to be ...

I think for a long time I already knew what I had to do, what really held me back and what my issues where, I was just somehow to scared and aprehensive to really make significant changes.
