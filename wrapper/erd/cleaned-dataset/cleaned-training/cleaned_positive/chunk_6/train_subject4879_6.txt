 does showing up and participating get you 100 percent?  




 they have yet to train me. i was hired sunday, and am supposed to be emailed about my training date, however they havent contacted me. i was hired as a cashier, so i definitely wouldnt be screwing them over by quittng. i just cant decide if i should tell the second store about the other job via email, or during the interview. thoughts?  




 so i should respond to the email inquiring about an interview with the second branch as if i hadn't already been hired by the first one? and ill bring up that i had already been hired during the actual interview?

by the way, thanks for your input, i really appreciate it! 




 the second branch emailed me asking about a phone interview. should i say in the email that i have already been hired by another branch but am interested in working at this one, or should i save that for the phone interview? 




 I applied to a supermarket chain, and on the website i was able to apply to multiple branches at a time. I was contacted last week for an interview for one branch, about about 25 minutes from my house by transit, and immediately after accepting that job, i was contacted by another branch, a 2 minute walk from my house, for a phone interview. what do i do in this situation? what do i say to the second branch?

thanks

any response is appreciated
