 Socialism  




 I can do my best to give you someone to lean on for a while, I can totally understand the desire to just be supported :]

Damn. Here's a happy one for ya. I work in an animal shelter, this morning I saw an older lady be reunited with her lost dog. The dog practically flew to the lady in our waiting area, even though the dog herself was like a hundred years old. Many slobbery dog kisses were given. It was pretty awesome, the lady started sobbing. She didn't think she would see her dog again (which is why microchips are always a good thing!) 




 Hi. I don't think your son would want you to feel this way, nor feel so terrible as to lead you to end your life early. 


Fight for him. Live your life with passion, and twice as much brilliance for him. Do everything you think he would have liked to do as an adult. Lead a life so incredible so that, when it is your natural time, and you are reunited, you have a thousand stories to tell him. None of which will be new to him, because no doubt he'll be beside you the whole time.


I'm sure he would still love to hear them though.


So build that life. Start traveling. Find a passion. Experiment. Live loudly, even if it feels wrong and alien. You'll find your rhythm eventually. Before you know it, you'll be making your son proud.  




 Hi. Want to talk? We don't have to talk about this, maybe stories or small talk. Something to distract you from the anxiety a bit?
