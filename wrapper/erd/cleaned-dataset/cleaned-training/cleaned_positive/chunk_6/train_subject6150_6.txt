 Your mana base is a little on the wobbly side. The panoramas are pretty shoddy, unless you have dual lands or shocks then they are still pretty meh. I would look into getting some guild gates they are dirt cheap. Glimmerpost is a really weak land. The artifact lands are weaker than basics IMO too many wipe effects hit artifacts, Darksteel Citadel is probably fine. Your counterspell package could use some work as well, counters that either do more than one thing like Cryptic Command and Dismiss are stronger, it is also nice for counterspells to deal with threats more permanently, like tucking generals with Hinder or Spellcrumple, or exiling with Dissipate, counters that steal the spell are great as well, like Desertion, Spelljack and Commandeer.  Just somethings for you to look into. May your kills be swift and many!
