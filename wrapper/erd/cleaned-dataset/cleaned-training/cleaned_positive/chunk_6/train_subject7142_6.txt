 I think you should have a discussion with her about what's going on,tell her you're scared she's talking about suicide,be there for her as much as you can and make sure she knows she can talk to you no matter what. Let her know that there's ways out : there's professionals out there who can help. Don't forget to take care of yourself in the process,by the way ! :)

If things still look bad I'd recommand you to tell her sister if she's close to her. I'd say the parents are the last resort,except if she has a very good relationship with them and you know they are supportive, of course. 




 I feel you,I'm pretty sure I would be less depressed and wouldn't have dug myself into a hole of lies if the people around me stopped shoving their nice problems-free lives down my throat.

Anyways,maybe it could help if you told your husband about what's going on ? Without being too hard on his family of course so he doesn't get angry or anything but just to let him know what's up. He might give them a reality check ! 




 That's a cool article ! I only play GTA and Battlefield so I don't have much knowledge about other games tho haha. Glad my advice was useful ! :) 




 It can be pretty much anything,you can start a blog on like,blogger or wordpress if you feel like writing articles about stuff,there's also tumblr ( which is what I use ) that allows you to reblog pics of whatever things you like or that inspire you and to create your own content. On both you can follow other blogs,interact with other users. It's nice really.
