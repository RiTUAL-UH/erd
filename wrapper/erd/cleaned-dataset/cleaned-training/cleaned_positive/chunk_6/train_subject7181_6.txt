 1. I am sorry... Is there a fitting place? I can delete the question if you think it is annoying but I feel that would be unfair for everyone that commented...
2. I agree on the emotional and mental abuse... luckily he never did physically abuse me (he even asks for permission multiple times every time he wants to do something rough sexually). Why danger?
3. That is what he is saying too... and everyone else here... yes I have no legal responsibility yet. I don't know if that will change once I get my MD...
