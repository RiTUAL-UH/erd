 Good call. I caught this after the edit and might have suggested the same with the last word. 




 Ah, the essence of the appreciation for life: that which has yet to come. Bravo! 




 **How do you know if you are in love?**

I asked her how love,  
Appeared to her heart.  
Said she unto me,  
Most cheerfully,  
"One hates yet cannot part!" 




 This I can relate to. Well stated. 




 **True Cowardice**

How dare you scold! How dare you scoff!  
Now dare you take these shackles off. 




 **The Quiet One**

Corrosive memories and toxic relations,  
Plague one heart and mind.  
Fear of rejection and dark recollection,  
With an axe to grind.   




 **A Steel Wheel's Brakes Makes Sparks**

Lies haggardly wander,  
Tracks of tragedy.  
Drenched in regret,  
Soaked in agony,  
Let us not forget,  
What became of thee.
 




 **Never a Chance**

A mistaken cradle sways,  
In the summer breeze.  
An infant lies awake,  
Suffering wants and needs,  
Of mother's abandoned dreams.   




 Cake. What year and engine? Couple hours tops for oil and brakes. $90 all parts included. 




 Yeah, it's not what we need right now that's for sure. That's what makes it even worse for them. They are going to get the shit end of the frustration stick. 




 there is literally a ton of this sort of stuff on ebay that nobody is even bidding on. 




 Good. Then you know where I am coming from when I say that this is our country and the last people to intimidate us will be those who think *that* kind of wind is at their back. Let's face it.. Americans and especially Texans are literally armed to the teeth for a reason.This is the only country in the world where any all out ground assault is guaranteed to fail.

 




 It wasn't. That's why it's not around anymore.

Duh. 




 these families have all these kids they can not take care off, so they do not get the attention at home, so they go and join gangs

Then you probably understand perfectly well how legalizing abortion reduces crime. What do you care if those children had been born or not? Would you be willing to house troubled teenagers from broken families? One is probably passing by someone you know right now thinking about how to get money out of them.

Just curious. 




 [Sadly, your point is valid enough.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect#Donohue_and_Levitt_study) 




 Fuck that. Get up and go buy a gun. Doesn't have to be nice. Go to a pawn show and get a 12 gauge or an old .270. Hell, you can get a Mosin-Nagant for less than $100 these days, and the ammo for it is super cheap.

Take it apart and polish each piece on your kitchen table. Put it back together. Take it to the range.

Learn how to defend yourself, and *voila*, panic and fear are replaced with practicality and resolve. 




 theyre across town. i'll get some pics to you this week. thanks! 




 I will condition a couple of thick strips for you and put simple buckles in them for $17.50 each unless you need really long belts. That's as low as I can go.

What colors would you be interested in? I have most basic colors and a few browns. When we talk about color, please note that leather is a natural product with consistency and porosity variations between hides that will tend to send a dye's color in one direction or another.

I'm thinking one Mahogany and one tan? 




 Depends on what you want done on it. I can do a full basket weave, scrolling, and name stamp for $75. Takes all day to do something like that and the work is spread out over a few days for the finishing process.

Name stamp, scrolling, and dye for $45.

Just a name stamp and some dye will go for about $25.

If you can give me an idea of what you are looking for I can give you a better quote. Thanks! 




 Whoever designed that website needs to be given a citation. 




 Did you get my PM? 




 Used to and made enough to float me between jobs. Once I get some new gear made I'll bring the store back. 




 I sent a PM. Totally willing to make a collar. I'd make 7,0000 collars if I could sell them. 




 These are some of the belts: http://imgur.com/ywXXFTo

This is the kind of belt you want to wear when you go to court for beating up a bully: http://imgur.com/KKf1CDG

First thing I tooled in almost 20 years. Came out pretty good I think. Fits a small Beretta or PPK like a glove: http://imgur.com/05ziZnC

The one and only "Hellboy". First big hit: http://imgur.com/cnqrDgl

What work in progress looked like. I was pretty drunk when I made this one but in the end it came out beautiful and I wound up selling it for $100: http://imgur.com/qS4cD6z. Here is the finished product: http://imgur.com/53bB5BN.

Buddy had a 9.5" barrel on his 44 so I made this for him. He just wanted something slick and no frills. He gave me $200 for it and a few custom bullets for his Ruger: http://imgur.com/0TENoFb

Hunter's orange on the bullet rings for Simon's 7mm mag sleeve: https://m.imgur.com/CIKjnIS

My grandfather's pre-64 model 70 257 got a butt sleeve too: http://imgur.com/gDkN0Yb. Love that gun. You can build loads for varmints or for game as big as elk. I'm wrapping it in leather to preserve it. No oils from the leather touch the stock.

I wear this when I go hog hunting. It fits over my belt and perfectly on the opposite sides of my belt loops so it doesn't slip. Note the different loads for different purposes: http://imgur.com/2374vd7

I made this belt when I was 14. Real silver conchos. This was before I learned how to preserve leather. If you have buckles or conchos or things that you'd like embedded into the belt, let me know: http://imgur.com/baEHKO4

I'm not selling ammo here. I am selling the leather. The reason I'm exhibiting ammo is to imbue the artistry I put into my work. Buy a belt or a holster from me so I can eat. I'm 35 and unemployable. This is all I have and I'll put my heart into your leather. I get so many compliments on the finish and you can just tell by the feel that these things will last a lifetime. These pictures are a few years old and are only a fraction of what I managed to salvage. I inherited the tools from my grandfather and want to do right by him by making things that people will wear forever and never need to buy again.

Thank you for reading. If you got this far, you deserve a pumpkin next halloween: http://imgur.com/9VqfDF6. This pumpkin made my kid so happy he wanted to take it to school.
 




 Haha you are going to get slapped to death by a limp wristed and perturbed mob in here for saying stuff like that.

So am I for that matter. Screw it. If you can't say what you mean you can't mean what you say, right?

Austin is not fun any more and a lot of people feel that way. 




 They have a cousin that looks similar and spreads Chagas. Theres a map I can dig up for you.

I kill them with fire.. harmless or not.  




 Del Rio and south of Hebbronville.

It was a shivering, clear December night, the stars visible through tendrils of smoke wafting out of an old, elevated deer blind at the intersection of two rutted roads. Old rifle brass lined the two by fours that framed the inside of our lookout, and we traded those stories into the wee hours of the morning, sipping from our flasks and enjoying the breezless night. The land owner sat next to me, obviously shaken as he recounted the time when the big pigs ravaged his campsite a few years ago. As I gaze down the moonlit path, a clean 800 yards to the top of the hill, the air is thick, freezing, and silent.

Then the path goes dark near the top of the hill. Not much of a silhouette to make out, just a dark area blotting out the entire width of the road way out there, too far to see with the naked eye at night. My 9x scope on my 22-250 was built to pick off javelina the next day, as were the Barnes TSX Varmint Grenades built into the tips, but my buddy had a 14x on his 30-06. 

All this passed through my head as I said, "Give me the gun", interrupting his story. 

I painted the road with the cross hairs at the top of the hill, and I what I saw blew my mind. It gives me chills just writing this. This pig's nose was on one side of the road and it's tail was on the other, but it was at least a 650 yard shot. A factory load at this distance would have to hit a pig that size clean through the eyes to knock him down. No wind, but I'd never shot this gun before and wasn't sure how it was sighted. I ran a few clicks on the elevation and took a deep breath, letting it half way out as my finger grew tighter on what was undoubtedly a hair trigger, adjusting the height of the cross hairs ever-so-slightly with what I knew about how to distance a shot.

Then it was gone. Poof into the 10' high dry, thorny scrub that only South Texas can produce, scrub only a hog of massive proportions could create a game trail in.

"It's gone!", I had missed my opportunity. But then, just as I said that and handed back the gun, another blob popped up a little further down the road.

This one was even bigger. I stared down my 9x and my buddy drew a mark with the 14x, but before he could muster the breath to steady his aim, this giant animal too was gone like a ghost. Then another one darted across the road, followed by a few smaller ones that looked pretty damned big themselves.

I might never know how much those hogs weighed that could block an entire lane of traffic, but I'll tell you one thing. The sound that guy made when he was describing them made me shit my pants a little, and by the time the sun came up that morning I was a believer.

Now I don't mind people getting on me about smoking in a deer blind. We were up high, the smoke was going straight up, and we weren't there to knock out big bucks. We were there to have an excuse to get drunk and bullshit with each other for hours on end without our wives telling us to come inside. All things considered, if smoking in a deer blind keeps hogs that big at 650 yards, I'm keeping a carton in the next one.

Laugh now, but if I could show you the 4x4 at the campsite gate that got chomped nearly clean in half, you'd be smoking too. It might actually increase the life expectancy of a big game hog hunter.

Also helped justify the cost of buying a 44 magnum and working up Ruger-only loads for it. I've owned that magnum since about a week after this hunting trip. If you want a 44 magnum show your wife some pictures of a giant hog and tell her they live where you hunt. She might even buy you one for your birthday. If she buys you a 380 after showing her the big hogs, well, you might want to revisit your marriage vows.

 That guy was probably from California. Don't feel bad about taking it easy on him.

hah!

FFS... You know what I really don't like about this town?

NOBODY CAN TAKE A FUCKING JOKE!

Get outta town.. haha... 




 This is gonna get buried but it also feels good to get it off my chest.

A few years ago a friend of a friend was in dire straights and needed a place to stay for a few nights. He was a computer guy like me so we had some things to talk about. He seemed like an OK guy, well ok not really but I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

Long story short the guy tries to get money out of me at midnight to go score crack so I have to eventually throw him out of my house at gunpoint and six months later I find out I got a warrant for my arrest because he told the cops he was me when he got arrested for a PI. They bought it even though his physical description is similar to mine in only that we are both considered caucasian.

Meanwhile during that six months I had been turned down for job after job, only to find out that I had this friggin warrant out for my arrest without any of these people bothering to tell me.

Never pressed charges on the poor bastard, and I probably could have SUED TRAVIS COUNTY AGAIN, but I did have to spend a lot of time and money getting the record expunged. Idiot cops didn't care about shit except getting another warm ass behind cold bars. That's all that matters.

Look out for number one, I say. 




 Austin... Austin... Austin.

Where does one begin?

I saw you when I was little, from the campus down Guadalupe,  
While my dad mastered computers, I learned to play pool at the union.  
Ben White was four lanes wide, you could skate across without a care,  
And there were cotton fields on I-35, between downtown and Pflugerville.  

Movies 12 was the place to go, to sit in their big, fancy seats.  
The Magic Time Machine's food was as good as The Broken Spoke's eats.  
It was fun to shoot my BB gun at cans under the Onion Creek Bridge.  
It was fun to do a lot of things in Austin when I was a kid...

Times they are a'changing, at least that's what my dad tells everyone,  
And anyone who will listen about the way things used to go about being done.  
There's even less good taste than there is common decency, he'd go on to tell you about,  
I guess I feel in today's day and age, there's no telling how things will turn out.  

Now the drag is dangerous, no matter who you are, or what time of day you go,  
And the school I used to dream of attending, flew out of reach years ago.  
The blistering interstate and buzzing city streets are packed 24 hours a day,  
With patrons of the overpriced sprawl running the entire length of the 35 Highway.  

The movies just suck now, ok that's not really Austin's fault..  
But the food here is hit or miss no matter where you dine a lot.   
My neighbors shot my kids' dog with their CO2 powered gun,  
And I am the bad guy for kicking these assholes out of town?  

This place is turning out like Los Angeles right in front of our eyes,  
And the lakes and rivers of the Central Texas region are all gonna run dry.  
Plastic bags are banned and recycling is in, everything is awesome and fantastic,  
Like the American dream that used to be part of this scene... it's all just made of plastic.

This place's culture, it's character, it's value, become more apparent as we grow older.  
It's definitely unique, but it's still part one thing, and it's beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  
When a town like this can lose it's appeal to the very people born and bred to revere it,  
It's a sign of the times that the rest of the country has long gone to hell in a handbasket.  

Austin, Texas is the home of a *very* prominent state government body that will continue to push the line between human rights and corporate interests to the limits, but if any single city in the entire country has the power to change all of that, it's Austin. For every jackass that arrives from another state who does not have a clue what Texas hospitality is really about.. FROM TEXAS OR NOT.. it's like having two good people leave. Just look at the fucking roads, people.. if people don't start understanding that IT'S OKAY TO BITCH about all these things, for the sheer fact that it makes other people feel OKAY about not being perfectly fucking happy in the great city of Austin Texas Music Capital of the World or whatever... people seem so reserved in their true opinions of this place and I like this thread.

TLDR: The problem is ______ people. 




 Now we know where all the interesting people live :D 









 Then the western end of the Davis Mountains is what you are looking for, maybe around Valentine. The further you get towards the mountains the more likely you are to see some gigantic elk. Mule deer out there are enormous too, pronghorn, pigs but not like south Texas, but you won't find anything without water. Land with water near it or near the surface still costs quite a bit out there, but if you look long enough I'm sure you'll find something.

I feel like I am talking to myself here. This is the kind of thing I'd like to do eventually. I grew up in Culberson county and for some crazy reason all I want is to go back out there to.. nothing...

Good luck. Would be cool if you came back and showed us some pictures. I'd strongly suggest looking up hydrology reports for the region. There are huge fault lines out there that make for deep water wells one one side of them and very shallow wells on the other.

I understand that Kent, Texas has about the cleanest well water you can find. An old timer they took samples for 11 PPM foreign particle out of one of the wells there long ago. 




 I only got an update to 8.0, but PTWC has it at 8.2 here:

 SEA LEVEL READINGS INDICATE A TSUNAMI WAS GENERATED. IT MAY HAVE
 BEEN DESTRUCTIVE ALONG COASTS NEAR THE EARTHQUAKE EPICENTER AND
 COULD ALSO BE A THREAT TO MORE DISTANT COASTS. AUTHORITIES SHOULD
 TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS POSSIBILITY. THIS
 CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR SEA LEVEL DATA TO DETERMINE THE
 EXTENT AND SEVERITY OF THE THREAT.

 FOR ALL AREAS - WHEN NO MAJOR WAVES ARE OBSERVED FOR TWO HOURS
 AFTER THE ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL OR DAMAGING WAVES HAVE NOT
 OCCURRED FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS THEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES CAN ASSUME
 THE THREAT IS PASSED. DANGER TO BOATS AND COASTAL STRUCTURES CAN
 CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL HOURS DUE TO RAPID CURRENTS. AS LOCAL
 CONDITIONS CAN CAUSE A WIDE VARIATION IN TSUNAMI WAVE ACTION THE
 ALL CLEAR DETERMINATION MUST BE MADE BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

ESTIMATED INITIAL TSUNAMI WAVE ARRIVAL TIMES AT FORECAST POINTS
WITHIN THE WARNING AND WATCH AREAS ARE GIVEN BELOW. ACTUAL
ARRIVAL TIMES MAY DIFFER AND THE INITIAL WAVE MAY NOT BE THE
LARGEST. A TSUNAMI IS A SERIES OF WAVES AND THE TIME BETWEEN
SUCCESSIVE WAVES CAN BE FIVE MINUTES TO ONE HOUR.

 Texas Dept. of Emergency Management was at the north Packery jetty Friday looking for it about 9 AM. I kept my eye out for oil or tar all weekend but didn't find any as of Sunday night near Packery. This moved in very quickly. 




 For the impatient:

http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/search/index?utf8=%E2%9C%93keywords=texas 




 West Texas has some of the cheapest land in the country. There's no water anywhere, no utilities for miles and miles, forget shade, and probably no mineral rights. I've heard of land near Van Horn still going for a few bucks an acre in big chunks. 

Curious as to why someone would post this question here. Can I be nosy and ask what you are doing? 




 If I had it to do all over again I would look past my initial interest in computers, where I work now, and I would have gone for the gusto by majoring in marine biology and geology, and only minoring in computer science. My passions are for fishing and rock hunting. I would be much happier if I were getting paid to be stationed on a research vessel in the Gulf or some remote research base rather than sit behind a computer all day only to design more of them.

But I am lucky in that I hate my job only because it is unfulfilling. I think most people who read your question would like to talk about their manager more than the fact that they want to change the world for the better, which I believe most people do.

I could switch jobs, but I'd still be working on computers if I expected to make great money. I could go back to swinging a wrench or a hammer, but then I'd be working my fingers to the bone trying to make ends meet.

What took me a while to figure out was the fact that computers are just a tool, like wrenches are tools. I liked computers a lot, and I like wrenches too, but I like camping and fishing a whole lot more.

Develop your passions and honor the experiences that sparked them because those desires only strengthen with time. Get out there and get paid to use your heart instead of your hands. Just remember that for the next 10 or 20 years that you are not just developing valuable skills, but that you are also cultivating happiness, something that money can't buy. 

 




 Most people in AA meetings, at least in Austin, are there because they have a DWI and it's part of their sentence.

In other news, you can get *sentenced* to AA, not only by a bottle, but by a judge.

This makes it punitive. If you've ever forced to sit through AA meetings with a bible-thumping, crack-smoking sponsor, you'll know how much of a joke it is for some people. While there are benefits to be derived from such a thing for others, the same could be said about driving out into the middle of nowhere and stranding yourself just so you can take two weeks to walk back. 

At least by the time you got back you'd have had a lot of time truly to yourself to think about the rest of your life. 




 I don't know how something from the 3-D plane could even be observed in 2-D. To say that a 2-D would see layers of the human body implies *some* thickness (that is, a value only measurable using a 3-D spatial vector) to be maintained in order for light to pass through it to make it visible.

In order to observe a 4-D entity in 3-D, I think space and time would have to cease to exist as we know it first since in the 4th time might be considered a spatial vector to be moved about upon rather than in one direction. To this end, a "being", if you will, capable of existing in the 4th dimension, would be able to go back and forth in time at will in order to find something. In order for that to happen, the medium in which this being exists must be ever-present, much as the ground we walk on is.

To observe a 4th dimension entity from within the 3rd would require applying 4th dimension physics to the 3rd, thus the possibility of leaving everything in the universe in all possible states in a single existence.

What I guess I'm thinking is that you'd at some point have to break the laws of physics for a given dimension in order to observe an entity from a higher dimension, and without any education whatsoever to back this up, it doesn't seem like you can break just one law of physics, if any can be broken at all. It seems like it's an all-or-nothing deal. You either get one D or another D, but never two of them at the same time.

But then, the 3rd dimension is simply a set of instructions for creating the 4th, which leads me to another question.. how can the 4th dimension exist at all (in the sense that it includes all of time as well) if time has not yet ended?

This sounds like the 4th dimension is *being* built, our perception of that process is our existence in the 3rd, and the 4th cannot ever be observed until *all* of time has past in the universe. It would then stand to reason that no 3-D could be observed from the 2nd without the entirety of the 2nd (space) being present at that instance.

This is all, of course, if you are subscribing to the notion that the 4th dimension utilizes what we percieve as time as a spatial vector, in which case it's a little easier to picture the 4th dimension as any one of infinite alternative universes that exist in parallel to our own. Multidimensional arrays in a given programing language seem to reflect/relate this concept rather well. The 4th dimension is just like the 3rd, except to find something you also have know *which* instance of the univese to look in, not just the place and time. As with the 2nd, in order to find something on must know the X, the Y, and the time to look at X and Y for it. 

Now it just sounds like the 4th dimension is just a collection of 3-D universes and all of the time measurable within them... except in the 4th, one can travel back in time, playing the interaction of mass and energy in reverse, thus eventually creating a huge ball of mass/energy that would eventually implode under it's own weight, perhaps similar in appearance to the way a star does, into whatever instance of existence the big bang itself emerged from. If one were so inclined.

"Hey dad can me and Jimmy go play in the Big Bang?"

"No, son. Remember what happened last time. You went too far back in time and created that universe with humans in it. They almost escaped."

"Aww! But dad! We sent them back!"

"Yes, and I know what else you did to them while you were handling them. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Now go play in the future, and be sure to bring me back a newspaper. I need to know exactly how much it's going to rain next month."

Ugh. I am *not* normal :( 




 A sustainable but humble place in the foothills of the Rockies so my son doesn't have to grow up in town. Would be nice to have a nice creek to fish, some mountainsides to explore, lots of trees. I'd use what's left over to build a big garage used to develop cost efficient methods of replacing combustion engines in vehicles with electric motors and batteries. Enough solar panels to keep a few charged. I'd customize the interior of large luxury vehicles with touchscreen displays, satellite and cell-based Internet access, vehicle system diagnostic displays, maybe even a doppler unit.

Then I'd be in business, armed with a ton of patents, and headed to town to open up shop. 




 I don't see why people stop at these places. The place is everything one could ever hate about consumerism. It's like going on a road trip to Walmart on Black Friday.They are overcrowded, and the prices are through the roof. Gas is at least $0.25 higher than the last town you left, the food they sell tastes like it has enough sodium in it to catch a swimming pool on fire, and most of the help are seasonal, back-woods Texas education system casualties that wouldn't know what to do without the calculator on the cash register.

When I think of this place, I hear the radio as I am driving down I-10 from Houston to San Antonio, and my peaceful thoughts are interrupted by a speeding vehicle past, and I can almost make out the incessant repetition of the word "Buccees! :D" from the cacophony as I swerve out of their way.

I picture an obnoxious family precariously tumbling out of an older gas guzzler with Alabama plates and Sarah Palin's election stickers on the back glass. As dad waits in line to fill up for 20 minutes, the collective stupidity of the troop can be felt from inside the store by innocent people just needing to replace a fuse, patch a tire, or take a shit in peace. Patrons flee the path of the stampede as it migrates towards the double doors, eyes bulging in different directions, with sparsely toothed mouths agape in awe of that stupid sign. Extremities flailing towards a door that should be pulled open, they are perhaps by now drooling enough to be spitting as they communicate with each other in a language only that family knows. They make more than a bee-line to the kiosks and occupy those available for a full 10 minutes, trying desperately to order extra chili and cheese on their hot dogs in salacious and monosyllabic debate.

The ordering kiosks are in ruins, and the smartest employee in the store is frantically trying to reset them so the 30 other people now waiting in line can get their nitrate fix on. The troop has dispersed throughout the store, barreling to and from the salt-and-sugar aisles, bumping into people and displays and knocking items off the end caps, forcing their way through the narrow aisles. It is more than one hapless employee's job to follow this escaped side show around the store with a mop.

Their order numbers are called one by one, and one by one they rush back across the store, arms loaded with absolutely nothing of true value or nutrition, hemorrhaging saran-wrapped fudge brownies and heavy metal bearing key chains from China that read "Welcome to Texas" for them to take turns chewing on. The pick up line is total chaos. As they argue with each other and complain to the help about who ordered what and the lack or excess of various condiments and toppings, somewhere down that highway a steer drops dead from dehydration, his emaciated carcass already being consumed by vermin before it even hits the ground.

The End. 




 There is no biological basis for race.

Then why arent caucasian children spontaneously born to mongoloid families?

I think you need to quit drinking your own bath water. 




 It's just an example. Chill out. He could have just as easily used any of the other millions of things police use to profile people that someone else would have taken issue with. Why not use race? It's a prime example of what cops use to fuck with people. 




 They are better off finding work elsewhere anyway. With their hours being slashed to deprive people of what is commonly being referred to as a human right, it's only a matter of time before they resort to worse tactics to pad their bottom line.. like colluding to further derail a minimum wage hike. 




 I think it's pretty well established that people don't give a shit enough about the planet to take their reusable bags to HEB on their own. If that were the case we would have figured out how to avoid this pile of garbage back in the beginning of the industrial revolution. Logic dictates that laws must be made to - wait for it - protect the planet from people!

What a concept. When I read about people like this I have to wonder what else they do for kickbacks. 




 Here we are trying to clean up the place while some politician responsible for less voters than the mayor of Waco needs to make noise in order to get re-elected, so he picks some progressive statue like the low hanging fruit that it is. 




 I am all for testing chemicals on the animals in Congress. 




 They could also build a solar panel farm [instead of Spain](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2424/3879608564_0eb3189ef3.jpg) to solve this little crisis.

How much would it cost to cover Culberson county in Texas with solar panels? Probably a lot less than drilling or chopping down the Siberian forests ever will.

 




 *This*, my friends, is why we can't have nice things:

The stuff you make plastic from is not the same stuff your car drives on

People wonder why I drink.
