 Thank you, my mother is an extremely negative person and although she doesn't mean to, she makes me feel very hopeless. I was nervous to post about this because I didn't know if anyone would care but the response (and the responses I see here every day) give me so much hope. 




 I cried when reading this but I think it was happy tears. Thank you, this was an immense help
