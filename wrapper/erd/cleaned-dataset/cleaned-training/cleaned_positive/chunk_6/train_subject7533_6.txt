 I don't see a therapist. I haven't ever felt a need to really talk about anything and finally did so at my families request. They're the ones treating me like a patient, so it's like the only people I have ever considered friends are now dehumanizing me. 

Also: I refuse to take medicine. Last time I was involved with the system I was placed on Remeron and later Wellbutrin due to a 90-day requirement by the courts. I follow the rules.

It made me apathetic, but made me function. I'd much rather be trapped in my racing mind with emotions than be trapped in a vegetative state. 

Edit: Also, I'd love to teach children English overseas. No one has given me a chance though. I don't want to work for corporate America as I am a tin-foil hat wearing cynic. :)
