 I feel exactly the same - I think it's important just to remind yourself that feeling ok or happy is a good thing. Also feeling a lot of guilt is also a side-effect of depression 




 Thanks, this has helped me feel less guilty for getting help - I guess i'm just getting to grips with and understanding what depression is 




 When I was younger I felt like I knew what it was like to be stabbed or disembowelled almost like that had happened in a past life. weird.
