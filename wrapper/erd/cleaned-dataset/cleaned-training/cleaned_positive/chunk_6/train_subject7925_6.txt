 When I'm truly happy, I feel like I can accomplish anything, and I feel like a totally different person from the depressed self-loathing human being that I usually am. When I'm depressed, I can't even IMAGINE being happy. I literally cannot remember what it feels like, and I am unable to bring myself out of it. 

I get into a 'happy' mood at least every other day, for around a couple hours, and sometimes it'll come on every day. All the other hours of the day are usually miserable. At some point during the happy episode, I remember that I don't deserve to be happy. I tell myself so much crap just so I can go back to being a miserable shit. Things like, "You're ugly. You're useless, you've accomplished nothing. You have no friends, you're a loser. Why on earth would you be happy right now?" It's so frustrating bc OF COURSE I won't accomplish anything or make any friends when I'm depressed. The only way to stop being a "loser" is to keep being happy. But I'm not allowed to be happy because I'm a loser. And the cycle goes on.

Does anyone else experience this sort of inner self-talk/vicious cycle? I desperately want to get out of it.
