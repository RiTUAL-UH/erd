Is there maybe a plug-in I can buy that has a pre-set effect like either of these? If not, does anyone have any suggestions of how I can use some of the default effects to get this look?

Thanks. 




 I'm trying to decide whether to get a PS4 or to just buy Madden 15 on 360.

If online head-to-head ends up being a ghost town on 360, I'd much rather have PS4 so I can have more users to play against, but if 360 has its share of online players, I'd rather save the money. 




 I'm not saying it should only be *legal* in certain instances, just that the writers would only implement it in special cases, such as this one.

Wrestlers wouldn't be trading titles and Royal Rumble/Money in the Bank contracts all the time-- only when they're extremely desperate (like Michaels was) to have a certain match. 




 It's not about the title, it's about the fact that Michaels wants to face Taker.

Did you even watch that angle? Michaels would have done anything to face Undertaker. 




  you can't have one person doing it and the other not doing it you know..

What do you mean? 




 He'd still have to defend it. Plenty of guys have been gifted a world championship in kayfabe.

Also, it wouldn't happen that often. Only in situations like this-- that's why I picked this scenario, since it was one where Shawn Michaels wanted to face Undertaker so badly that he'd relinquish the most prestigious title in WWE just to do so. 




 For example, in 2010, Shawn Michaels was desperate to face Undertaker at WrestleMania, and knew that he had to win the Royal Rumble to do so, since Undertaker simply refused to grant him a rematch.

Edge, not Michaels, won the 2010 Royal Rumble, and HBK's hopes pretty much completely went up in smoke.

But what if Shawn Michaels had entered and won the Raw Elimination Chamber match for the WWE Championship, and then offered a trade with Edge-- your Royal Rumble number-one contendership for my WWE Championship.

Who wouldn't take that deal if you're either side? Edge gets to be champion without having to fight for it, and Michaels gets the Royal Rumble contract (I guess it's a contract?), which he uses to grant himself a match against The Undertaker (who was the World Heavyweight Champion) at WrestleMania.

Crazy enough to work? 




  When you train, you can improve muscles for aesthetics (having a larger physique with good definition) or performance (actual muscle strength). Obviously the two aren't mutually exclusive, but most exercise programs tend to emphasize one over the other. 

This is what I'm trying to tell people. Most wrestlers do the former, and Cesaro obviously does the latter. I don't think scoop-slamming Big Show was as awesome a feat for someone like Cesaro as people made it out to be. 




 Is there a reliable site that actually lists his legitimate height/weight? 6'5, 232 is just what he's billed at by WWE. He's so muscular that I wouldn't be surprised if he's 250+. 




 You can increase the efficiency of your muscles with certain training.

And I never said pro wrestlers aren't strong. 




 Right, I understand that. I've heard from people who know weight-lifting and bodybuilding, though, that, for example, scoop slamming Big Show while being Cesaro's size is not the galactic accomplishment it was made out to be. It's simply because wrestlers train for looks, not strength, so guys end up huge but not able to lift what they could if they were possibly less massive, but did strength training. 




 I'm no expert on translating someone's physical stature to their approximate level of strength, and I always hear that Cesaro is absurdly strong to not be a 300-pound hoss. Is this true, or are the 300-pound hosses just not the powerhouses they should be (with exceptions, like Kane)?

 [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/serotonin) states that:

*Some cases of depression are apparently caused by reduced amounts or activity of serotonin in the brain; many antidepressants counteract that condition.*

So that means that serotonin, to put it like a five-year-old, is a "happy" neurotransmitter. Then, the definition goes on to state:

*Excessive brain serotonin activity may cause migraine headaches and nausea.*

Why is this? If serotonin is a neurotransmitter that counteracts negative conditions such as depression, why can it also cause nausea and migraines?

Also, how do medical professionals determine if depression is caused by lack of serotonin or another cause? 




 How does half-life affect dependency/addiction, etc.? 




 Might sound like a stupid question, but I assume all of this means that biological half-life (key word being "biological," I suppose) isn't artificially adjustable?

Certain drugs have a certain half-life and we just have to live with it, I assume?

Also, when it comes to pharmaceutical drugs, are there any advantages/disadvantages to longer/shorter half-lives (other than the obvious)? 




 Why do they measure it by half-life and not the "full life"?

Also, what factors of a given drug affect its half-life? 




 It has to do with how long its effects last, right? 




 Asked this of another user in this thread, but just wanna be sure-- I *do* have a case about the texting, right? 




 Just to be sure, I do have a case about the texting, right? She acts like not definitively finishing a text conversation is the eighth deadly sin. 




 For example, if we exchange text messages for a while and I suddenly stop texting for whatever reason, she gets an attitude, presumably under the impression that I'm obligated to text until the conversation "officially" ends... despite the fact that we're not in a committed relationship (which was her choice).

Or she'll get mad because she thinks I'm talking to other women on OkCupid (where we met) if she sees me online and I'm not talking to her... again, despite the fact that we're not in a committed relationship.

On a more specific note, neither of us has a car, but she doesn't live too far away, so she catches the bus to come see me. She complains about the heat for the entire walk back to my house from the bus station, and asks me to do something about it. Being mostly short of ideas other than blocking out the sun, I suggest that she catch a second bus right at the bus station where she normally gets off now. That would drop her off literally right in front of my house. She starts bitching because she doesn't want to pay an extra dollar (even though I pay her bus fare most of the time).

She's always right, I'm always wrong, and if I:

* Go to the kitchen to get her a drink (which she doesn't drink because she thought she wanted it but really didn't)
* Go across the street to buy her something to eat (which she doesn't eat because she fell asleep)
* Go to the bathroom to get her an Aspirin because she has a headache
* Go get her another drink because the first one I got for her is warm since she didn't drink it,

I'm a terrible person if I tell her I don't feel like getting up for the fifth time in an hour, and going back to the kitchen to heat up her food.

Her home life also sucks, and I sympathize with her on that. Problem is that she, of her own self-admission, takes it out on me by talking to me with an attitude because "there's no one else to take it out on."

---   

**tl;dr**: [22 F] FWB acts more like she's [16 F], constantly complaining and whining about damn near everything and refusing to talk things out. I'm [25 M] trying to learn to deal with it/convince her to talk things out by saying something other than "Whatever" when I try to have a mature discussion about our issues. 




 He did put Doomsday over, even if it was technically a draw. 




 I think in non-kayfabe, Shawn Michaels has him beaten easily. Although when I think of best wrestlers ever in this context, I tend to lean towards in-ring ability, charisma, and mic skills more than ability to draw (not to say Shawn Michaels was a slouch in that area, either).

It's why Hogan is somewhat low on my non-kayfabe list despite being a global phenomenon for damn near the last 35 years. 




 His accolades:

* **15-time WWE/World Heavyweight Champion** (second to Ric Flair's 16)
* **WWE/World Heavyweight Champion for a combined 1,192 days and counting** (fourth to Hulk Hogan, Bruno Sammartino, and Bob Backlund)

* **3-time United States Champion**

* **2-time WWE Tag Team Champion   2-time World Tag Team Champion**

* Officially recognized as being **1-0 in Money in the Bank ladder matches**, but is **2-0 in ladder matches at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view**

* **3-time Slammy Award winner for Superstar of the Year** (only multiple-time winner in the award's history)

* **2-time Royal Rumble winner** (tied for second w/Batista, Shawn Michaels, and Hulk Hogan to Steve Austin's 3)

* **68.19% win percentage in 654 WWF/E matches** (highest win percentage of any wrestler with 360+ matches wrestled-- Bret Hart won 72.14% of 359 matches in WWF/E)

Who can match that résumé? And when I ask that, I'm not implying that no one can-- I guess I'm just asking you guys to share your opinions on why someone else has a case over him.

I'm sure Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, Steve Austin, The Undertaker, Bruno Sammartino, Hulk Hogan, and Ric Flair all have convincing arguments as well.

**Remember, though: Kayfabe only.** 




 I remember someone saying exactly this like a year ago. It'd be funny if it was you (no disrespect). :-P

They just do it to add to the visual impact of the move. Every sport does it for the most part. 




 I think they meant actual Money in the Bank ladder matches, not just matches of any kind that occurred at the "Money in the Bank" PPV. 




 It's like the Patterson-Gimlin Bigfoot footage. Bah gawd. 




 Not to take the focus off of the topic, because I love that counter, but my favorite has to be Kane sitting up to avoid an RVD frog-splash... with the bonus being that RVD had placed a chair underneath Kane.

I wish I could find it. 




  notice HHH is outside the ring

As is Randy Orton 




 http://youtu.be/UsZUA2232fE?t=1m39s

Each wrestler gets a monologue sound byte on why they'll win the Money in the Bank ladder match. Then, after each one, the wrestler who just spoke is shown being taken out by the next speaker.

* Cena finishes monologue, then gets a step-up corner enzuguiri from Del Rio
* Del Rio finishes, gets a Brogue Kick from Sheamus
* Sheamus finishes, gets a cross body block from Bray Wyatt

Then it goes back to the chorus of the song. After that:

* Orton finishes monologue, gets an uppercut from Cesaro
* ~~Cesaro~~ Paul Heyman (whose client Brock Lesnar conquered the Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania) finishes monologue on Cesaro's behalf, Cesaro gets a flying clothesline from Kane
* Kane finishes monologue, gets a Spear from Reigns

It's like each wrestler is "taking over" the video by attacking the previously-speaking superstar so that they can say what's on their mind, and the cycle goes on and on.

Well done, WWE production crew.

 Here's an interesting analogy I thought of while making this thread. Batman fans will get it immediately, and even if you're not a fan of the Caped Crusader, it's very simple:

Bane. The mask that he wears essentially keeps him alive, although that's slight hyperbole. If he takes it off, he won't die-- he'll just be in incredible, excruciating pain until he puts it back on.

"Tough love"-ers will accuse those who suffer from crippling depression of being weak, good-for-nothing losers who sit around being unproductive everyday-- playing video games, watching TV, surfing the web, eating unhealthy foods, and neglecting their own hygiene and responsibilities.

They do this because they might understand the concept of a "comfort zone," but they don't understand the extent to which a comfort zone is important to someone who's being psychologically mauled by depression for every second of his/her life.

That's where the analogy becomes relevant. Many people with severe anxiety/depression can tell you that their comfort zone is like Bane's mask-- technically, we don't need it to live, but being without it causes us unimaginable pain, and when we ask for help to get through the pain when we don't have the mask to put on, all some of us get in return is "Do it yourself. You're an adult." (I'm 25)

For example, my "mask" is basically my room, which I assume is somewhat normal for a person who's depressed. If it wasn't for video games, television, and the internet to distract me from the fact that I want to break down into tears for no reason during every single waking moment of my life, I'd probably go insane.

Certain people in my life expect me to take the mask off, leave my comfort zone, and do things like look for work or apply for school (my grades sucked in high school, and I had to withdraw from junior college because the work plus my depression simply overwhelmed me).

I try to tell them it's not that easy, and that while it's technically possible and I won't die if I take three hours out of my day to go out and look for jobs, I'd be so miserable the entire time that I'll have to spend the rest of the day recovering from the pain once I put the mask back on.

Now, if Bane had someone to help him endure the pain by being there with him, encouraging him, etc., as he fought through it, I bet it'd be a lot easier. When I ask for help, though, I get the same thing-- "You're an adult."

Sure, I'm an adult. But I consider myself, and many other people I see in many places, to be psychologically crippled by depression.

Imagine that someone you care about, adult or not, has two broken legs and can't walk. Suddenly, they fall out of their wheelchair and ask you to help them up. Would you tell them to stop bitching and get back up themselves (which they technically could do-- it'd just be very difficult), or would you offer a hand?

Yeah, I'm done venting. I just wish I had someone in my life who could be my emotional crutch (which, for some reason, I think has a negative connotation-- someone who's impaired needs a crutch. It makes sense to me).

I've been depressed for at least 15 years and I've never had one. Why am I a bad person for being afraid of things that are scary (essentially, life outside of my comfort zone)? Don't I deserve someone (in a personal, not professional, capacity-- a friend, family member, etc., as opposed to a psychologist) to help me get over my fears and overcome my depression?

**NOTE:** I used the term "we" many times throughout this post-- if I'm the exception rather than the rule, and I'm really just horrendously lazy and basically a waste of life because that's who I am and not because of psychological issues, I apologize for grouping myself with others who suffer from depression. 




  Basically, you sound like a pot head I know.

I don't smoke at all and never have. I take Xanax. 




 I'm not an expert, but it seems like Xanax and marijuana both have the same effect for the user-- to slow down depression/anxiety and make a person feel better, to put it simply.

However, most, if not all physicians won't allow a patient to take Xanax indefinitely, because of inevitable dependency issues. Does marijuana have that same potential of dependency? If it doesn't, why isn't it legal everywhere for medical purposes? Or why doesn't the field of pharmacology look into what the difference is between the two and figure out if (what would essentially be) non-addictive Xanax is possible?

Note: I'm assuming marijuana actually has legitimate anti-depressive qualities. If not, then could someone explain how it works? 




 Usually, I drink my beverages right out of the container (my roommates don't drink the same things I do, so I'll chug it out of a can or a gallon jug. I gives no fucks). This is for a couple of reasons:

* It keeps me from using dishes or having to buy disposable cups
* I don't have to go up and down the stairs to the refrigerator to get a drink (my room, and "entertainment headquarters" as I call it, is the basement [by choice])

Usually, during non-summer seasons, and even during summer sometimes, the insulation in my basement is so bad that it's always significantly colder than it is outside. So during the winter, leaving a drink in the basement is almost as good as putting it in the fridge.

But now that the weather is warmer, and it's no longer close to freezing temperatures down here, my drinks are going bad quickly if I leave them down here for more than a day or so! What am I supposed to do now?! Use a glass?! And then have to WASH IT?!

WHAT THE HELL, WORLD?! 




 Also, the pitcher/catcher analogy seems like a really good one, and I feel like I'm this close to getting it, but I'm still not quite there.

 Sometimes, Pitcher throws a ball and it lands in the middle of the room. But sometimes, Pitcher grabs the ball before Catcher can get to it, and then he throws the ball out the window   it never makes it into Catcher's bucket.

If the pitcher throws a ball that isn't catchable, and the catcher has to get up and go get it, why would the pitcher go and pick it up himself and throw it out the window (basically discarding it)? Why are they basically in a race to get any of the baseballs that aren't caught by the catcher (if I have that right)? 




  When the part of your brain that makes serotonin uses that method to give serotonin to the part of your brain that needs it

Why does the brain do this in the first place? It seems terribly counterproductive and counterintuitive all at the same time.

"Here's some serotonin to make you feel better. Psyche, just kidding [takes it back before it even has a chance to take effect]."

That's not nice, brain. 




 So if a person's body doesn't produce enough serotonin (water in this analogy), that's like a hole being in the flowerpot? And inhibiting reuptake is like plugging up the holes so that the plant can get enough of the little bit of water it has access to? 




 I searched and found [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/jtr4n/eli5_reuptake_inhibitorsantidepressants_and_how/), but I still don't get it.

If, for example, a person's body has a natural lack of serotonin, why does its reuptake (absorption to the brain) need to be inhibited? Wouldn't the reuptake need to be increased, since there's so little, and the brain needs as much as possible?

I feel like there's probably a simple analogy that could be used to explain this. It seems like the brain absorbing a deficient neurotransmitter is bad... but I don't understand why. 




 I honestly feel kinda like a freeloader since I've made like five or six requests here, but every time I think I have some extra spending money, I have to get refills on my prescriptions for depression, anxiety, and Crohn's disease (having all three is exactly as exciting as it sounds). But I just absolutely loooooove me some pizza. It's probably my favorite food in the world, no exaggeration.

As a result, I figured I'd at least try to do something to earn me some 'za. So here's some random GIFs that I hope can make someone laugh enough to find me deserving:

 Advanced Photoshop editing, non-linear video editing with programs like Sony Vegas/Adobe After Effects, etc.

Is there such a subreddit?

Thanks. 




 The first time I actually acted on it was with the chick who likes to drink that I mentioned in another reply. She was pretty much in a fighting battle against passing out, but she wanted to have sex anyway. I kept telling her no, because she was too drunk, but she wouldn't listen and actually grabbed my head and forced it into her vagina (she knew I was good at eating out).

I sighed, rolled my eyes, and went with it. It was pretty cool, but I had no idea it was because of this or any particular fetish.

The second time was with the same chick, and she wanted to pretty much the same thing-- she drinks too much, I go down, we (or pretty much I) take it from there. So it happened, and then I started realize that the more obvious it became that she was completely out (not responding no matter where I touched or what I did, her limbs flopping lifelessly as I moved her around, etc.), the hornier I got. I thought about it for about a half-second, then kept going, but made a mental note.

The next day, I looked it up, and discovered that there's an entire world based on this fetish. I was awestruck. Ever since then (this had to be four years ago), I've been scouring the internet for forums, videos, pics, communities, and pretty much anything that had to do with this. I've found a lot, and I'm still looking and still finding. 




 It's a lot easier than you might think. No one I've told it to (I think... four women?) has found it weird or creepy or anything. In fact, like I said in another response, at least three women have volunteered and/or given me permission to act on it whenever I want.

I'm no sexologist, but it might make them feel more attractive, since the message I'm sending is pretty much "I want you so bad that I can't even wait until you wake up/recover from alcohol poisoning."

Note: Just kidding about the last part. I never encourage women to use liquor to induce a state conducive to my fetish, even if they say they wouldn't mind. 




 The sense of control, without having to actually take control-- I'm about as assertive in the bedroom as SpongeBob would probably be. That may have been a *slight* exaggeration, but you get the point. I can do what I want. I think it's honestly that simple.

I also have other weird sexual tendencies, I guess. I like to grope, massage, and kiss a woman way more than I actually like intercourse. Key phrase being "**I** like." Women don't enjoy just laying there while I rub them all night (which I can and have done). So if they're asleep, problem solved. They don't have to be bored or annoyed with my stupid preferences in bed. 




 Two women, both with prior consent. One a heavy drinker who couldn't hold her liquor, and the other a narcoleptic. A woman I'm talking to now said she'd be willing to do it for me too, but hasn't yet.

TMI alert: Just thinking about it is making me horny. 




 I've actually dated a narcoleptic. I probably would have married her if she wasn't completely insane.

I had the best sexual experiences I've ever had (by far) while dating her. It was heaven. 




 Not without sleep fetish porn (yes, it exists-- Rule 34 never lies). 




 I fell asleep after I made this thread. I might make a new one so I can reply more quickly, and hopefully get more responses. I love answering questions about this. 




 For the record, this is not to be confused with either necrophilia or any kind of rape fetish. It's not based on the potential lack of consent (in fact, prior consent makes it better), and the woman *does* have to be breathing.

So go ahead and ask me anything. Anything at all. Nothing's off limits. 




 I had a feeling someone was going to do this, which is why I specifically didn't state that he also grew up in West Philadelphia (no joke).

I feel kinda goofy, so I'll answer the question somewhat seriously. He actually never got into fights over basketball, because he knew he was so good that people would get mad if he bet money on one-on-one games in the street or something and he kicked their ass. He mostly kept to himself, shooting around on the court alone.

His brothers, though, would constantly bet money on my dad in a game against, in his words, "anybody on the court." His brothers made hundreds of dollars on certain days because no one realized how good my dad was. 




 The Boston Celtics. He hurt his knee during the pre-season, so he never played in a regular-season game, and he was never NBA-caliber again after the injury. That's why he went to the foreign leagues. 




  Do you also play basketball professionally?

Not even close.

 Also, what's your perfect Sunday?

Video games, internet, pizza, television, basketball. 




 Um... yes? Not quite sure what that has to do with the topic at hand, though. 




 His years outside of the NBA were played mostly in Argentina, and he grew up playing basketball on street courts in the inner city before he blew up (both in height and talent) as a college freshman.

He's 61 years old and neither me nor any of my friends (all in my age range-- I'm 25) can beat him one-on-one (and it's not like we all suck that bad). His jumper is absolutely unreal, and he's an extremely intelligent player, which I suppose helps when it comes to beating players more than twice your age.

So go ahead, AMA, and I'll relay the questions to him if I can't answer them myself. 




 Prescription medication for depression, anxiety, and Crohn's disease has emptied my pockets and, ironically, made my depression worse. I feel trapped. But if one has to be trapped, being trapped with pizza by his side would certainly help. 




 o_o I'm also a 25-year-old with Crohn's. What was it like the first time you started to realize that something was seriously wrong with your gastrointestinal system?

I remember my first time, when I was throwing up like crazy and had so much stomach pain that I had to call an ambulance to pick me up for the first time in my life.

Then they gave me a Foley catheter (look it up if you're not OP). Not exactly a day at the beach.

But the morphine... morphine is good... :-)

Also, did they think it could have been anything else? Doctors told me at first that I was just constipated, then they theorized that I had appendicitis. It took like a month for them to realize I had Crohn's. 




 If anything, it would be more arousing, since it would relieve me of any tension regarding moral right/wrong.

Consent makes this fetish more arousing. That's why I can so confidently say that it has nothing to do with being aroused by rape. 




 Well, I don't plan to play any humans. I can probably live with just having fun playing the AI-- I don't see myself becoming a hardcore fighting gamer.

Also, with the combo memorization, I'm afraid that if I go through the entire process with one combo, and master it, I'll lose that mastery once I move on to the next combo (especially since a lot of recent games are so open-ended and have many unique combo possibilities). 




 It's not a rape fetish because it's not the lack of consent that causes the arousal. However, acting out on this fetish, as far as the law is concerned, is rape.

Which, to say the least, kinda sucks. 




  Once you're comfortable with that, look up character guides and find a combo labeled 'bread and butter' - these are your general purpose combos that can be tossed out in many situations. If several are labeled with that, just pick one to start. Grind it out in Training Mode, breaking it up into 2 move chunks so you can see how each one chains/cancels/links. Do it until it's fully ingrained in muscle memory, then play some matches to work it into your game.

Should I do that with one combo at a time? i.e., try to memorize one "bread and butter" combo until I can do it without thinking, and then try to utilize it against the AI in an actual match? 




 First off, fighters that I own:

* Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3
* Injustice: Gods Among Us
* Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe

To put it simply, my main problem comes from the concept of combos. It's not that I have trouble understanding how combos work or anything, but I'm just not used to game genres where memorizing combos is necessary (if I'm wrong about this, please let me know, and I apologize).

I guess the issue with me is that I'm not really good at watching what my opponent is doing, reacting to it, remembering my character's strengths/weaknesses, and those of my opponent, all while knowing how to react offensively with combos. I hope I explained that well.

Thinking about it, it really is kind of hard to explain. I don't have any trouble actually executing combos (at least in practice), but I just can't commit the combos to muscle memory so I don't have to actually think about it during a match.

Did I articulate that clearly? I feel like I didn't. :-/

Please don't be mean, i is a n00b :-( 




 Thanks! :-D 




 As bad as this is going to sound, having a sexual experience with a woman who's in a coma *would* be an ideal experience. I simply would never do it on moral grounds. 




  Would general anasthesia (as in, actual complete lack of consciousness, not just sleep) also work?

It would. As long as I know there's even the smallest chance that they might wake up (since they're actually alive, and sedatives can wear off unexpectedly), it works.

Also, that's not the entire basis behind the fetish. I'm still learning more about it myself. I like to be able to move a woman around in bed (as in physically pick her up, sit her up, maybe even so much as drag her to another room), and that's obviously not possible unless I know she won't wake up.

It could be also an issue of control. I'm not an assertive person overall, so if a woman isn't responsive, I can have control without being forced to *take* control. It also lets me do whatever I want without being worried that the woman is annoyed or bored. I love sensual touching, massaging, kissing, etc., and could do that all night without actually having intercourse... and I've done it before.

I still have a lot of thinking to do about this as a whole.

Would it work if someone pretended to sleep?

Absolutely. The ends justify the means with this fetish. It's all about the woman being unresponsive, whether genuine or not. As long as she's convincing and I can't tell she's faking it, I'm fine. 




 Oh, if only I'd seen this message earlier.

I'm not sure, but I assume there's a chance you might go to sleep again within the next day or so. If so, let me know. :-P 




 Not sure how I feel about canoes, but if there's a hot chick sleeping in it, I'll try it! 




 I actually know a little bit more about alcohol consumption than I should, for someone who doesn't drink at all. I know that a BAC of 0.4 or higher is usually fatal (and 0.08 is the legal limit for driving in most states), and I sorta know how to estimate how much a person has drank based on what they're drinking and their body weight/previous experiences with alcohol.

With the one woman, I tried to make sure she didn't drink enough that would take her anywhere close to 0.2. 




 Hmm.

Necrophilia is the first one that comes to mind. 




 I guess because it gives me more control. It's like a game-- I see how far I can go with touching, kissing, undressing, etc., until she wakes up. The further I can go, the more turned on I get. 




 Only one woman has actually done it for me. I do worry about potential health ramifications, but I guess maybe it's more of a risk than I thought.

However, I never, ever ask a woman to do this by using alcohol, or any sedative/depressant. 




 Hmmm... are you a drinker? That definitely helps (I always feel bad when I recommend alcohol for anything, though... _).

Or maybe over-the-counter sleep-aids. Just don't overdo it, obviously. No more than the recommended dosage, especially at first. 




 Better than you might imagine. I've told, I think, four or five women about it, and not one of them found it weird or creepy or anything. They were mostly willing to participate.

I think it might make them feel more attractive, since I'm basically saying "I want you so badly, I can't even wait until you wake up." 




 Yeah. Actually, that's even better. Obviously, I wouldn't take advantage of someone in a coma or who had suffered some sort of major injury, but I've had women willing to drink until they pass out so I can act on this fetish.

All in all, the more unresponsive, the better. But this isn't necrophilia-- they at least have to be breathing and not in any danger of dying. That's part of the fetish, actually... the challenge, I suppose, of touching a woman sensually without waking her up.

If I can undress a girl while she sleeps without her waking up, that's a major turn-on. 




 I like to watch women while they sleep, touch them, hold them, etc. It's by far the easiest way to turn me on.

Note: This is NOT a rape fetish. It's not based on the lack of consent. I'll gladly elaborate further if asked.

So go ahead. AMA! 




 No sob story. I'm just broke as hell and really want some pizza.

Will definitely pay it forward as soon as possible.

Thanks, guys. 




 I would treat myself, but I don't get paid for a while (but it's before the date).

Also, pizza would help calm my nerves if it turns out she's a tranny or a serial killer.

Will reimburse as soon as I can. 




 I happen to find breathing to be extremely fun. 




 You clearly missed the part where I said I enjoy water AND air. I've got hobbies just like anyone else. 




 [I also just realized that both options I put in the thread title are basically the same thing.](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/78/781071bbd5d2abb8b0666cc0afd048c83a3b24e647888cec5a1c8617bfd4320d.jpg) 









 For what it's worth, I (the author of the linked thread) am not the OP of this thread. But... thanks for the publicity...? 




 I'm good with words (like, really good), I can make GIFs of pretty much anything you want so long as the video exists somewhere on the interwebz, I can make funny videos with the audio taken out and replaced with something humorous... I can even make highlight videos for your favorite team/player if you're a sports (mostly NBA/NFL/pro wrestling) fan. [Here's my YouTube page.](https://www.youtube.com/user/RayAP17/videos?view=0 flow=grid)

I dunno. I figured it was worth a shot. Do your worst. I CAN TAKE IT.

Oh yeah, and I live in Philadelphia, and the only chain that delivers to me is Domino's. 




 Threads like these make me weep for humanity.

They make me weep tears of joy, that is. You guys are awesome. 




 And if anyone is kind enough to offer, I promise I won't make love to it.

EDIT: I'm located in Philadelphia, PA (actually right outside of it in a small town you've probably never heard of), if having that information matters. 




 I think I do (not being sarcastic).

One. Hulk Hogan, but only because Kevin Nash was supposed to break up the pin, but he took too long to get in the ring. 




 Background for those who may be curious but unfamiliar with either of the combatants:

The Undertaker, when competing at WrestleMania, is, as far as we've seen, unbeatable. He can take far more damage in a match than any wrestler in the history of WWE (and its previous incarnations) without being pinned or made to submit. At one point, in a match against Triple H two years ago, Undertaker's nervous system was (in-universe) on the verge of irreparable destruction due to the ass-kicking Triple H handed him. And Undertaker won that match. In short, **The Undertaker has kicked out of moves and situations that would have ended other wrestlers' careers.**

Mike Tyson, on the other hand, is a somewhat well-known former professional boxer whose most dangerous weapon is his punching power. He's knocked out opposing fighters (for a ten-count) seconds after the bell, and he's obviously a far better boxer than Undertaker.

Undertaker, in this scenario, is exactly what he's portrayed as being at WrestleMania-- a superhuman giant who can't be pinned even if he should, by all rights, be dead.

Mike Tyson, meanwhile, is an absurdly powerful pro boxer, in a boxing match (giving him a massive advantage to counteract Undertaker's durability), who can probably knock out any man on the face of the planet with one clean punch.

In a somewhat ironic occurrence, Jim Ross (a commentator for WWE) once compared being hit with a sledgehammer to being hit by a Tyson right hand. Undertaker has taken multiple sledgehammer attacks to the face in at least one match at WrestleMania, and he still did not lose.

Now, the rules. This is a standard boxing match, other than the following stipulations:

* No separate rounds. The fight goes until it's over. No breaks at all.
* Victory can be attained by knockout and only by knockout. Someone has to knock his opponent out for a count of ten to win the fight.
* Both fighters are required to wear official boxing gloves.
* No pins, no submissions, no grappling.
* No time limit, and no points system.
* If either fighter hits below the belt or in the back of the opponent's head, the fight is thrown out as a no-contest.

Undertaker is obviously not a boxer, but he has three things that work in his favor:

* He has some amateur boxing experience, so he wouldn't be completely lost despite still being galactically mismatched
* He's far more durable than anyone Mike Tyson has ever fought. Undertaker's ability to absorb damage and continue fighting, compared to standard professional fighters, is superhuman at the very least.
* No round intervals. Mike Tyson, as a boxer, would be used to getting a break every few minutes to rest and ponder strategy (on the off chance his opponent isn't on a stretcher in the first 30 seconds). Undertaker might have better stamina than Tyson, and can use this to his advantage by gambling that Tyson will get tired before Undertaker stays down, if Undertaker basically allows Tyson to punch him and tire himself out (it worked for Muhammad Ali against a similarly powerful George Foreman in his prime).

Tyson's advantages:

* It's a boxing match. 'Nuff said.

Basically, the question is this-- which would happen first? Mike Tyson does the improbable and pummels Undertaker to the point where he can't get up in less than ten seconds (remember, in pro wrestling, he had to get a shoulder up in less than **three** seconds, so keeping him down for ten would be difficult to say the least), or Undertaker survives the inevitable onslaught from Tyson (also highly improbable) until Tyson tires out/makes a mistake/both? 




 Strictly speaking of the respective movies mentioned in the thread title. Also, feel free to define "intelligence" however you'd like.

Note: I asked this on /r/comicbookmovies, and I was advised to post it here. If this is considered off-topic, I apologize. 









 ... would he give him a push? 




 Either that, or simply a subreddit where people can discuss video effects and such, that may not be specifically for requests.

Thanks in advance, guys. 




 I noticed the 400 some-odd dislikes on that video and couldn't help but LOL hard, because we all know where the majority of those probably came from. 









 Of course it isn't! :D 




 To be fair, I'm not starving, or really anything close. I'm just eating crappy foods. I do appreciate the sentiments, though. 




 I live in Philadelphia, PA, and the only major pizza chain near my house is Domino's. It's been colder than I can ever remember, and I had to shell out close to $400 to fill half of my oil tank so the house could stay warm.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to help.

**EDIT:** Made a typo in the thread title. Should say "Had to choose between being broke and being cold." 




 Any suggestions? If you need any more info, please feel free to ask. I also apologize if I forgot to mention anything that's standard for this subreddit. 




 Two friends of mine just moved into my (two-story) house. They (a couple) share a bedroom, and my bedroom is in the basement. Since it's been so cold, we both use 1500W space heaters to keep our respective rooms warm.

As a result, the electric bill has jumped to an insane $262 in the last month. Do you guys have any suggestions for cutting down on the electric bill (at least ones that aren't obvious-- I realize that a given appliance shouldn't be on unless someone is actively using it)? 














 You might have offended OP by saying "That was dumb." 




 I manage to make ends meet, for the most part, by doing odd jobs (shoveling snow, babysitting, etc.), but I recently had to spend literally all the money I have on medication for my major depressive disorder and Crohn's disease. I've been living on mostly cereal, bread, and water, but I've had no food in the house since this morning (about 9 AM EST) and no idea when I'll have any money.

Anyone willing to help me get by today? Thanks in advance.

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the upvotes, but I still haven't come into any money. If it makes a difference, I'll definitely reimburse as soon as I'm able to do so. 




 Ah, that's understandable.

I wish I could do that, but I've only ever followed WWE, and that's only been since roughly 2000/2001. 




 What I meant was that Tamina and AJ may have been aligned with one another before we actually knew about it. If they were, and they were allies in that Battle Royal, Tamina and AJ could have cooked up the whole scheme so AJ would win the match. 




 Why is that, exactly? 




 I don't see how any of this implies that I'm not doing most of the work myself, or that I'm "really not even into" this. I just have other things that I'm into more. I'm not a hardcore comic-book movie type of person, and I'm sure there are quite a few people here who are.

If you don't want to help, just don't. 




 On a serious note, I really hate when people do this. It's obvious that I was speaking strictly in terms of kayfabe, so why even say something like this? 




 The reason I included mostly his WWE career is that I'm much more familiar with it than his WCW career.

I do know certain things that I think I left out, like how he would lash out at referees for trying to raise his arm after a win (despite being a babyface-- that's typically a heel move), or the fact that after his first match (I think), Gene Okerlund attempted to interview him, and Goldberg just walked away without saying anything.

Plus the fact that he quite literally won 173 straight matches, including a World Championship victory over one of the most accomplished wrestlers of all time, and I don't recall hearing him brag about it ever (in kayfabe-- though, to be fair, he was never much of a talker). 




 It's hilarious to imagine AJ being willing to take a kick to the face from the strongest Diva on the roster, just to be number-one contender for the Diva's Championship. 




 Huh? A script? That's dumb-- wrestling is a legit sport. It's not like they call it "Sports **entertainment**" or something. 









 [Original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookmovies/comments/1sds3h/can_anyone_whos_seen_a_lot_of_the_modern/)

I hope it's not in bad taste for me to re-post this so soon (or even at all), but the thread I linked to above faded into obscurity and I still need a bit of assistance.

Thanks to a lot of very helpful people in the original thread, I was actually able to tackle a lot of the requests I had, but I'm still stumped on a few of them.

If anyone wouldn't mind, I just need to know where I can find clips of the following (not expecting precise times-- asking for something like "1:05:33 in *The Dark Knight* would be too much. I just need rough estimates, like "In the first 1/3 of *The Avengers*," or "Just before the final battle in *The Incredible Hulk*," etc.):

* **(1)** A character defeating another, despite the fact that he's completely outmatched in size, strength, power, and durability. Perhaps maybe even one instance of a single blow from a smaller character, sending a much larger opponent hurtling across the room/city/planet.

* **(2)** Super speed

* **(3)** Danger intuition (the ability to see or sense imminent danger to oneself without having to literally see it with one's own eyes; Spider-Man's Spider-Sense, for example)

* **(4)** A character whose main power is superhuman accuracy with projectiles, archery weapons, or whatever they can get their hands on. Guys like Green Arrow, Hawkeye, Bullseye, etc. Basically anyone who specializes in marksmanship.

* **(5)** Superhuman reflexes

* **(6)** Superhuman durability. This can apply to almost any character, I believe-- what I need is footage of characters who are clearly worn down after sustaining long-term injury during a fight (struggling to stand/breathe, but still attempting to fight), with visible damage (tattered costumes, cuts, blood, etc.), but not necessarily both, and not necessarily only one of those two

* **(7)** A change of allegiance. Any scene or group of scenes that make it at least somewhat evident, just from the visual, that a character has switched sides (either good to evil or evil to good).

* **(8)** A group shot of multiple heroes teaming together, whether they normally do (X-Men, Avengers, etc.) or don't. Something like [the revolving shot of The Avengers after Hulk's "I'm always angry" moment.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PvEP3BqzSxU#t=79)

* **(9)** Character A is helping Character B walk, because B is too injured to walk on his/her own, but is still conscious and thus doesn't have to be literally carried. B is basically using A as a crutch. [Something like this.](http://troop50.org/first_aid/images/walk_assist.gif)

* **(10)** A character, either using his hands or a blunt object/weapon, knocking a projectile out of the air.

* **(11)** A character simply using his body as a battering ram and throwing a hard shoulder into his opponent, knocking the opponent off of his feet.

I really hope this doesn't break any rules, as well as that I don't seem like I'm being greedy and asking too much. I apologize if so.

Thanks in advance to any and everyone who offers their knowledge. 




 Here's one for Goldberg that I wrote a while back. One of my favorite wrestlers of all time.

[Bill Goldberg character analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vhtcu1596REvzG48L8JYwht6fey0y3XDawJPPEv1UMc/edit?usp=sharing) 




 _ If it's so awesome, then why does that comment have negative karma? 




 Oil for furnace heating is pretty expensive, and the electric heater does next to nothing since the room is much longer than a typical bedroom.

Can r/frugal give me some tips to stay warm? I already wear lots of layers and stay wrapped up in a blanket as much as possible. 




  I think you're reading to much into this.

[I tend to do that sometimes](http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1nhqjv/on_062303_kane_broke_a_mirror_backstage_before/) 




  My name, my name is Alberto Del Rio

But you... you already know that. 




 Hmmm. So you basically think that instead of toeing the line between kayfabe and reality, they just decided to destroy it in this particular context? 




 If Helmsley is his real name in kayfabe, then who the heck is this "Paul Levesque" that CM Punk brought up? 




 I don't see why that would be too bad, as long as the face they pair the announcer with doesn't just disappear after getting somewhat of a push. 




 When he's on SmackDown, he demands that Lilian Garcia introduce him in Spanish. All good, since she's apparently fluent. But when Del Rio is on Raw, Justin Roberts introduces him in English.

So in kayfabe, Del Rio should be none too happy about that, and maybe he gives Justin Roberts a beatdown simply for not being fluent in Spanish.

It would also be somewhat ironic, since some Americans (like Zeb Colter, which makes this all the more relevant) tend to complain that citizens from Spain/South America/etc. don't speak fluent English.

What think, r/sq? 




 The question is "Why does she use both?" Does CM Punk's "Phil Brooks/Paul Levesque" comment mean that Hunter Hearst Helmsley isn't his real name in kayfabe?

If it *is* his real name in kayfabe, why would she also call him "Paul"?

If it *isn't* his real name in kayfabe (which I suspect), why would his own wife also be calling him by his ring name?

I guess a comparison I could make is if either Rowan or Harper called Bray Wyatt "Bray" and "Windham" throughout the same storyline, switching between the two for seemingly no reason. 




 Right, but you'd think she would pick one or the other to refer to him. Maybe that's just me, though. Like, you never hear Triple H refer to HBK as "Michael." 




 Is this weird to anyone else? I feel like I might be acting picky, but I was just wondering, though. 




 Just letting you guys know that I added one more request if anyone feels like having a go at it. If not, I understand-- you guys have done plenty as it is and I can't tell you how grateful I am. 




 You shouldn't. I've never heard of any man ever sitting on the toilet to take a dump and not realizing the seat is up. We look before we sit.

Why women have such trouble with that, I'll never know. You would think that since they sit ALL the time, they'd be MORE likely to look before they sit. That it would become reflex. 




  --EDIT-- For new additions
 
 
 
 13) Pyro at the end of x2 when he stands watching magneto about to take off in a helicopter before mystique points him out to magneto. Also when you see him later on the chopper flying away. Alternatively hawkeye getting mind controlled by loki's sceptre.
 
 
 
 14) Only examples are from Avengers or X-Men. Obvious one is the avengers one you mentioned, or the scene in x2 when they are all in the president's oval office when Prof X freezes everyone, or in X3 when they make a line to fight back magneto's men.

You're awesome. You know that, right? 




 Cool. I was afraid you would think I was being a douche _ 




  Oh look, all the numbers have transformed into '1'.

You could put each number in parentheses, if you feel like it. Either way, very much appreciated.

**EDIT:** Also, you made me realize something as well-- don't be afraid to branch out, guys. I really liked the Kickass, Hancock, and Ghost Rider suggestions. I'm not saying don't include the more prominent films (Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Avengers, etc.), but ANY comic-book movie would be a worthy suggestion. 




 I honestly wish I could. I had initially decided that I wasn't going to tell anyone the exact nature of the project, but I've actually been asked more than once. I'm contemplating spilling the beans.

Can I think about it? 




  that's only if OP doesn't want to spoil the climax of Avengers in whatever this project is

Nah, spoilers aren't an issue in any way.

Also, if you (or anyone) has thought of any alternatives that haven't been mentioned, feel free to speak up. The more ideas the better. 




 That *definitely* helps. I really appreciate the quick response.

You also made me realize that I should probably number each of the bulletpoints in the OP to make it easier for you guys. 




 I'm doing a project (like, an independent project, not a school project) where I need to use footage from pretty much any superhero film.

And actually, for the record, I said "movies" in the topic title, but any footage I could find that's live action, as opposed to animated, would work-- for example, footage of Clark Kent from the TV series *Smallville*.

Anyway, I need certain clips from the movies/live-action television shows, but with there being so many, I don't have nearly enough time to watch them all.

**I was hoping any of you guys could point me to which movies and at which points I can find instances of a character displaying the abilities that I'll describe below. By no means does it have to be an exact time (like, 43:05 in *The Wolverine*)-- just something like "Near the very beginning," or "Just after ______ scene in the middle," etc.**

Thanks in advance to anyone and everyone kind enough to lend a hand.

Anyway, here goes nothing:

**Clips I need (heroes, villains, anti-heroes, anti-villains-- everything is fair game):**

* **(1)** Characters using some type of eye-beam/heat vision power (preferably Cyclops, Superman)

* **(2)** Large characters leaping great distances (only person I can think of right now is The Hulk, but any character will do-- and tbqh, it doesn't even have to be one who would be considered "large," but that's just my preference. The key here, though, is that the character is leaping, not flying) 

* **(3)** Powers involving electricity/fire (Pyro, Human Torch, Thor, etc.)

* **(4)** Super speed

* **(5)** Danger intuition (the ability to see or sense imminent danger to oneself without having to literally see it with one's own eyes; Spider-Man's Spider-Sense, for example)

* **(6)** A character whose main power is superhuman accuracy with projectiles, archery weapons, or whatever they can get their hands on. Guys like Green Arrow, Hawkeye, Bullseye, etc. Basically anyone who specializes in marksmanship.

* **(7)** A character defeating another, despite the fact that he's completely outmatched in size, strength, power, and durability. Perhaps maybe even one instance of a single blow from a smaller character, sending a much larger opponent hurtling across the room/city/planet.

* **(8)** Mobile invulnerability (strong, massive characters who are impossible to immobilize as long as they're moving; Juggernaut is the best known example, I believe)

* **(9)** Super strength (The Hulk, The Thing, Bane, etc.)

* **(10)** Superhuman reflexes

* **(11)** Superhuman durability. This can apply to almost any character, I believe-- what I need is footage of characters who are clearly worn down after sustaining long-term injury during a fight (struggling to stand/breathe, but still attempting to fight), with visible damage (tattered costumes, cuts, blood, etc.), but not necessarily both, and not necessarily only one of those two

* **(12)** Weather manipulation (of any kind-- Storm is probably the most likely candidate for this)

I think that's about it. I'm not asking anyone to tackle of all these at once, or even more than one. That'd be asking way too much. If I could get a helping hand for even half of these, I'd be appreciative.

Thanks again in advance, guys.

**EDIT:** I don't mean to be greedy, but two more I could use are the following (both of which I know are really ambiguous and therefore might be hard to tackle):

* **(13)** A change of allegiance. Any scene or group of scenes that make it at least somewhat evident, just from the visual, that a character has switched sides (either good to evil or evil to good).

* **(14)** A group shot of multiple heroes teaming together, whether they normally do (X-Men, Avengers, etc.) or don't. Something like [the revolving shot of The Avengers after Hulk's "I'm always angry" moment.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PvEP3BqzSxU#t=79)

**EDIT 2:** All of you guys are awesome. I can't put into words how much easier this project will be because of the help you all provided. That said, anyone at all who has any suggestions that haven't been mentioned, please don't hesitate to speak up.

Also, I've got one more (I know, I know... sorry, guys. You're just getting me more and more into the project. Darn you whippersnappers :P):

* **(15)** Pretty simple. Character A is helping Character B walk, because B is too injured to walk on his/her own, but is still conscious and thus doesn't have to be literally carried. B is basically using A as a crutch. [Something like this.](http://troop50.org/first_aid/images/walk_assist.gif) 




 I'm doing a project (like, an independent project, not a school project) where I need to use footage from pretty much any superhero film. I said "2000" in the topic title because I think that's around the time when superhero movies really started to get good, especially with the advanced visual effects, but if I'm wrong, let me know.

This can apply to almost any character, I believe-- what I need is footage of characters who are clearly worn down after sustaining long-term injury during a fight (struggling to stand/breathe, but still attempting to fight), with visible damage (tattered costumes, cuts, blood, etc.), but not necessarily both, and not necessarily only those two

* Weather manipulation (of any kind-- Storm is probably the most likely candidate for this)

I think that's about it. I'm not asking anyone to tackle of all these at once, or even more than one. That'd be asking way too much. If I could get a helping hand for even half of these, I'd be appreciative.

Thanks in advance, guys. 




 This would be for a basketball project, so preferably someone with a non-regional, American accent, but I'll consider alternatives as well.

The voice-over itself should convey drama and a sort of quiet intensity. Something like a movie trailer (especially relevant since it's a basketball/film crossover project). If this sounds too specific, don't worry-- I'm definitely not picky.

Here's a sample line from the (349-word) script:

*While their fiery glares are incapable of slaying the enemy, these nearly omnipotent men show extraordinary abilities which eerily resemble another well-known faction of superhuman allies.*

*Whether seeing the unseen with extra-sensory perception, or fighting injuries that would disable mortal men, true warriors of the hardwood know not the difference between fantasy and reality.*

Hopefully that sample elaborates well on the tone I'm looking for-- if not, I'd be glad to explain further, and also to answer any questions anyone has.

Note: I'm not sure if this would be considered long, but the entire script itself takes up just over half a page in Microsoft Word (Verdana, 9-point font).

**EDIT:** Wow, thanks for all the submissions, guys! I'm pleasantly surprised that I was able to get so many on the same day. I'll go over all of them by tomorrow morning (probably around 9-10 AM EST), but that doesn't mean that more entries aren't welcomed. Please, by all means, if you see this thread and want to submit something, feel free.

**EDIT 2:** As I said before, I very much appreciate all the entries. You guys are amazing. I'll try to make my decision by tonight, and most likely tomorrow afternoon at the latest.

Thanks again, everybody!

**EDIT 3:** I made my decision and added the appropriate flair to the thread. I can't thank everyone enough for their contributions, and I look forward to working with members of this subreddit in the future. 









 On a boxer's defensive style against a slower opponent:

*Ken’s were strides so elegant that he seemed to glide across the ring as he evaded the deadly right hook. Chasing his opponent across the squared circle, Cross was forced into a deadly defensive dance to which only [Ken] Cassidy knew the steps.* 




 Either blank can be as many words as you want, by the way. 




 But what about red? Most people naturally associate the color red (at least a darker red) with fear and dread, don't they? 




 Actually, this isn't a project that uses footage I'll be shooting. I make sports highlight videos. I probably should have specified that. My bad.

As for my skill level, I can tell you how good I am with Vegas (since I think you were asking about my talent as more of a traditional producer/director)-- I've been using it for at least 5 or 6 years now, so I know a lot beyond the basics. I know how to adjust and combine effects, transitions, etc., and even if there's something I don't know that would help me with this, I'm willing to learn.

Thanks. 




 It's not a full-on horror movie type of project, but I just want a sort of chilling, creepy, unnerving undertone to the video. Make it seem sort of like the trailer to a horror movie.

Any suggestions, guys?

Thanks.

**EDIT:** I apologize for not specifying. It's a sports video, just like all the projects I make. I should have definitely said so in the body of this post.

Here's a link to my channel if you're curious as to what exactly I make:

 Assume they won't tell you anything. All you can do is something that you think would make most people happy. 




 Next you'll tell me that the internet thinks cats like cheeseburgers or something. 




 Psh, right. Like there are random pictures of cats on the internet. 









 I downloaded the videos in FLV format, and I just used a simple non-re-encoding converter to convert them.

I honestly have no idea why they're coming out at 120 fps. The FLV files are without a doubt 30 fps. 




 I know it might seem strange to have a problem with 120 fps, but the thing is that I'm manually reducing the frame rate of each clip to about 18 fps. To do this with a 29.970 video, I simply change the event's "Undersample rate" to roughly 0.6. But for me to do this with a 120 fps, I'd have to set it much, much lower (0.150 to be exact). That's an extreme reduction, and I'm hesitant to use it, for fear of potential complications.

Is this something I should be concerned about, or can I go with the 0.150 undersample without worry? 




 OP and his boss know each other, so they can joke about things like this. He might not know his boss' mother, or she may be deceased. Even if neither of those are true, that comment would still upset a lot of people unless you're damn near best friends.

Now, if it was a female coworker, and he said something like "I know! We're not gonna get sex and you're gonna be broke!", that seems like it'd be fine, since, as you said, she made him the butt of a joke, so he in turn does the same to her. But not somebody in her family. 









 In my experience, managers will also suspect that the employee asked the customer to do this. 




 I really hope that you can't simply change containers by renaming the file, because if you can, I've been doing way too much work for years. 




 In all fairness, despite my comment, I think he meant work as in "labor," not work as in "your job."

I don't think he'd call it "work" if all someone does is sit in the tiny bookstore at the mall that nobody goes to and twiddle their thumbs all day. 




 Sounds like a guy who never stuffed and sealed hundreds of envelopes a day.

Boooooooooooooooooooooooooring! 




 You might get a guard dog that can catch a home invader in the act and maul the hell out of him, but I think you'd rather have a guard dog who scares would-be thieves from even attempting to break in. 




 MKVtoMP4, the program whose download page I linked to in the OP, converts files from (obviously) MKV to MP4 without re-encoding.

I don't know anything about anything, so I couldn't tell you how. I just know that it takes about 45 seconds to convert a one-and-a-half hour 720p video, whereas most standard converters take as long to convert the video as the length of the video itself (sometimes longer). 




 Damn, you are cold.

Pun not intended. 




 Yeah, I'd appreciate that. 




 I feel kinda stupid, but I honestly can't figure this program out. Is there a "Skip re-encode" option anywhere? It doesn't appear to be on by default. 




 Normally, to convert large and/or numerous files to MP4 or such, I use any of available programs that convert files without re-encoding-- this makes the process exponentially quicker.

I tried using [MKVtoMP4](http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MkvToMp4), but for some reason, when it converts FLV files, as opposed to MKV files, they come out at 120 frames per second (I need my footage at 60 FPS at the very most-- prefer 30). If anyone knows how to fix *that* specific problem, it would solve this issue as well.

I know that "a couple hundred" is a lot of files-- don't ask. If there was a way I could have procured all of these files in any other non-FLV format, or use the FLV files as-are, I promise I'd have done it or would do it. 




 I'll tell you know since I know how ruthless Reddit can be in the event of a noticeable meme mistake-- you didn't use this meme properly. There are only a few memes where one line of text is allowed, and this meme in particular is supposed to follow the "X... X everywhere" format. 




 I always sag my pants, even with a belt. I hate it when the bottom of my pants legs don't hang over my boots.

Hit me.  




 NO SNITCHIN, GRANDDAD
