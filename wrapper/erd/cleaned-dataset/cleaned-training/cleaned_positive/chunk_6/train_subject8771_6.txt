 And suddenly I really want mac and cheese... 




 Oh my god....i don't have words...what just happened? 




 Team avatar is back! Water, Earth, Fire and Glove!! 




 I want!! 




 That is so cool! I wish my cat had eyes like those beauties.  




 I like his...blow torch. 




 D'awwww! It's so cute, I'm gonna die! 




 "Fan" club..haha i see what you did there... 




 Look to your right under "spoilers" 




 Seriously? the shipping is getting out of hand... 




 abc family? 









 I feel like the most likely outcome in this season is that Korra loses her bending. i know nobody wants that to happen, but I think if this happens she will be able to get more in touch with her spiritual side. I think it was mentioned in a post somewhere that [Amon closes a chakra in order to prevent a person from bending](/spoiler). If Korra is able to get in touch with her spiritual side, she could unlock it and then kick his butt.  




 "you gotta get him for me..."  




 It's the game on nick.com that gives an interactive tour of Republic City 




 I think having to wait two weeks for the new episode is unnecessarily depressing... 




 [Tell me it's not true!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdk262sZ4oc)  




 Agreed. I mean how can you say no to that face? 




 Cept it's at the bottom of Lake Laogai... 




 OHHHH SHIT LIN! YOU BEND THAT METAL!  




 This totally happened to me cept I was about to take a Latin final and I mentioned briefly that I spend a lot of time on the avatar sub-reddit...A girl in my class got real excited then. Her eyes got wide and her gasp could have been heard a mile away. It was hilarious and we then proceeded to geek away about Avatar. Good times.
