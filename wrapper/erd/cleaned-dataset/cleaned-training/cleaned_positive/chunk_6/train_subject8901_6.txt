 I wasn't planning on sleeping anyways 




 Wat 




 Haven't watched this, is it any good? Part 2 any good? 




 Companies make shitty tools so you'll end up buying replacements sooner than later to spend more money  
  
I'm looking at you truper, you piece of crap 




 Elephant trunk I think, could be wrong 




 It spoiled a remake that could've been good 




 Yeah, like I said, I got mixed up because the two movies happen in the same building  




 Ah yes, frontiers  




 There's this other French movie (not martyrs) about a group of people that get kidnapped by psychos, or is it martyrs? Can't remember but those movies are also gut wrenching.

I spit on your grave remake also gives me an uneasy feeling. 




 Awww 




 I'll never let go Jack "omnomnomnomnom"

You gotta let go Rose "omnomnonomnomnom"
