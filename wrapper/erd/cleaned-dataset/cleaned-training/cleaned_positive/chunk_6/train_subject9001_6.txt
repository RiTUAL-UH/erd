 Thank you :-) It really does feel like you're "floating" through the lows, just letting the days pass by. It seems like you're more in need of support than I am right now, so please stay strong, remember that this will pass. Sending good vibes your way 3 




 What I garnered from this video was how society reacts to confidence in someone out of the ordinary. They first try to figure her out, questioning her gender, asking if she is being payed for this. When she doesn't respond, they resort to taunting her, throwing things, splashing her with water, and one person actually shoves her to the ground; all in an attempt to provoke a reaction.  




 It's troubling how far they went in an attempt to provoke her. 









 Thank you!
