 That's exactly how I feel. I mean my boyfriend has shown me things he used to doodle in class as kid and there amazing, they're so detailed and so complicated for his age. Other kids used to think I was great at drawing when I was the same age but I never progressed from that level even after doing art in school for 4 years (had to swap classes because the teachers said it wasn't my "thing" and I'd be better off doing something else and that really stuck with me)
