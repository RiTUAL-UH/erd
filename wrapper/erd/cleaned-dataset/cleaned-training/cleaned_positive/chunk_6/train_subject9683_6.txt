 Who's Hotter? Lyla Michaels or Amanda Waller? 




 Fuck Thea, Marry Laurel, Kill Nyssa, Divorce Laurel, Kill Felicity, Revive Nyssa, Fuck Nyssa, Marry Thea, Fuck Cupid, Divorce Thea, Fuck Sara, Fuck Sara again, Kill Lyla, Marry Diggle. The End. 




 Make John Diggle buff as fk. 




 I didn't like the special effects until the ending fight scene with the heat vision... that was nice. 




  Hal Jordan will appear. Maybe not as Green Lantern, but just as Hal.

But they mentioned a pilot going missing on The Flash? Maybe he appears as a normal human in the flashbacks? or an alternate universe where ever Barry went.

andnbsp;

Also what about Slade Wilson, Walter Steele, Joe Wilson, or expanding on the story of Oliver's child.  




 Ted Grant is still alive.  




 Who is the mayor now anyways? Is it like Ray Palmer or something, cuz didn't the mayor get shot by Sarab?

andnbsp;

Also Oliver as Mayor would be awesome, it would be a good time to introduce new characters, maybe a new member to Team Arrow? or bring back the salmon ladder, and by salmon I mean Colin Salmon, Walter Steele. 




 He did it in Season 1 Episode 4 with Peter Declan, he's already fought against Mirakuru on the island, and God knows what in the 2 last years of his time away from Starling City, could he, prove Harrison Wells as the killer? Or even find out Harrison Wells' true identity? 




 DIGGLE!!!! 




 The nerdgasm I will have, if he meets Hal in the flashbacks as a regular guy, then meets him as Green Lantern in the present.

* His Baby Mama

 I know, but ya never know what's going on in the heads of Berlanti, Guggenheim and Andrew "you know" Kriesberg. 




 I posted earlier that I was rewatching some of Season 2, and in Ep2x16 "Suicide Squad", when they're all talking to eachother and getting in position, they called John Diggle "Freelancer" and on the DC wikia (i know that's not anything official but) when you go to [John Diggle] (http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/John_Diggle_%28Arrow%29) and look under aliases, you see Freelancer, and it links to [this villain](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Freelance), it also says he's an enemy of this superhero named Triumph, so maybe Triumph will be introduced? Also off-topic, but Lyla Michaels in the comics is Harbinger who has some connection to Supergirl, so just a heads up on  possible future crossovers. 




 They hinted at H.I.V.E. trying to purchase the earthquake generator when talking about Gholem Qadir. Just shows how ahead of the game the writers are, I hope to be that some day. 

andnbsp;

Also: http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Gholem_Qadir 









 actually looking back at my post, i don't think Deathstroke could be a main villain, cuz what would he do different than in Season 2? Oliver has nobody anymore, and by Season 6, Speedy will be able to protect herself. 




 I'm hoping that maybe Roy Harper is pulling a Malcolm Merlyn. Maybe sometime in Season 5, the police agree with The Green Arrow and they get the news that Roy Harper faked his death and he's welcomed back to the probably renamed 'Star City' by Ray Palmer. 

Also, my thoughts for main villains to prolong the series.

Season 4 - Damien Darhk

Season 5 - More H.I.V.E. stuff/Return of Deadshot

Season 6 - Deathstroke back(will appear in both previous seasons in smaller roles)

Season 7 - Merlyn

Season 8 - Chien Na Wei

idk just a dream :3 




 I think we've gotta give a hand to Manu Bennett, he portrayed Slade so well. 




 What's AO3? 




 You know what, I might be wrong, I found a discussion on Wattpad from a few years ago, where this dude had a problem finding a target audience, and wanted alternatives, and this comment helped me realize my problem http://www.wattpad.com/forums/discussion/comment/5738047/#Comment_5738047 




 nah, I wasn't mocking, it's just that I don't think Wattpad has much variety in readers, most of them are teenage girls looking for something about One Direction or some cheesy romance story. I guess it's just not the right site for me :( 




 I have an account on Wattpad (and fanfiction.net, but anyways.) I'm writing a story about the shows 'The Flash' and 'Arrow', basically my version of how they will go on after Arrow Season 3 and Flash Season 1. Is it considered a fan-fiction? Because every time I look at a list of fan-fictions, it's always about some teenage girl meeting Harry Styles or about Harry Potter and Hermione's love life, and I never see regular adventure or horror or crime or science fiction stories, it's always romance. 




 If you look at the list of Green Arrow villains http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Green_Arrow_enemies

All of the main ones have appeared, except Onomatopoeia.

The rest are dead, arrested, in an A.R.G.U.S. max prison, or leading the League of Assassins. 




 Oh please keep this up, we want more.

I want to start making a fan-fiction on Arrow and The Flash, but I suck at planning out things, I usually just go with whatever comes to mind, then see where it takes me -_- 




 Eddie dying doesn't destroy anything either, they couldve stopped the blackhole... but The CW lied with the episode title...

They weren't "Fast Enough". 




 HOLY CRAP YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT! 




 Not sure how they will get out, now that's i've heard all of your different perspectives, but I think with Barry coming next episode, Starling City will be saved with another S.T.A.R. Labs cure like they did with the Mirakuru. It seems they are just amazing at "reversing" things. 




 LOL yes xD 









 I think it was the insulin that General Shrieve had in the flashback 




 I think Maseo tricked Ra's and brought him the insulin from General Shrieve. 




 That was amazing, the acting was great!  




 Same! xD
