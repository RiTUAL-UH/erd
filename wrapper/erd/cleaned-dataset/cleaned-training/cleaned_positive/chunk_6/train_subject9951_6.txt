 Yes, since earthquakes are basically tectonic plates moving around. I'm sorry I'm terrible with but I'm worse at explaining with real words. So think of to this way. 

You are stuck in a room with 30 people, all cramped up. You cannot move at all. Everyone seems relatively okay with this situation, except you. You cannot handle it anymore, so you move a little to the left because you felt like the person to your right was way to squished against you. That causes your neighbor to your left feel uncomfortable, then she moves. Then everyone moves until everyone feels relatively comfortable again.

Same with earthquakes. Usually, they are demonstration of "release of seismic stress". When one area has release its "stress", maybe at another place, the stress has risen, which could lead to another earthquake.  




 You said you don't mind it, or you would actually like it. You're obviously not the only one. However there are people out there who hate it. The exceptions do not make the rules, especially when it comes to something that bothers a quite important group of people. 

Like my race doesn't like to be called a certain way. Does it bother me personally? Nope. But would I encourage people to use that word most people of my race hate? No. Because I'm the exception. I think differently. I don't make the rules.  




 But did you read my comment though?  




 Damn son who hurt you as a child?  




 Not really. It's such a popular topic amongst people who are often called "exotic". Didn't know it would spark such reactions, to be honest. And I thought my opinion would be obvious. 

I guess we're from different worlds.  




 But where are you though? On the internet, probably from a Western country, where such an opinion is very common.  




 Because you're acting like pedophiles are the scums of the world when they're not different from any other criminals.  




 You think being a stay-at-home person is easy though? HA. 




 How about people who molest adults? Are they more "saints"? 




 In a way, yes. How can I explain this.

Nature is old, and will forever be old. Maybe to us, 11 earthquakes in 30 days seems a lot, but on a bigger time period, say millions of years, it'll seem like average. For instance. If you eat on average 2 chickens nuggets per day, and you were to eat 60 chicken nuggets tomorrow (before that you ate none), then for the rest of the month you eat none, you'd still, on average, have had 2 per day during that month.  




 Not really. Paedophiles are only people who are attracted to children. People who act upon this attraction are either very deranged or perfectly sane, but horrible.  




 Since when was this an unpopular opinion though?  




 Never said it was primarily used for people, I said when used for people, most of the time, it as that "only good for the eyes/good for sex" connotation. And, it is used to describe a certain group of people that many people from the Western world find "good for the eyes/good for sex". As an example, I said South-East Asians. 




 Different people think differently. That's the beauty of humankind.  




 It was an example. I'm not going to enumerate all the instances in which this reality has been observed by mankind.  




 Whoa there someone is hurt.  




 Earthquakes happen almost every day though. Small ones can happen hundreds of times in a day. Bigger ones are less frequent, but still maybe one or two per month. Many are underwater as well, and we definitely do not hear about those, unless they cause a tsunami or other visible damages.  




 No, because my primary argument is that exotic as a certain quotation the word foreign doesn't have. My example is that the word exotic is primarily used to describe people who are also seen as "good for sex".  




 Nah. 




 Ah ok sorry about that : ) 




 I don't know about you, but to know that "my kind" is "good for sex" is not a thing I would want to know about myself.  




 Touché. 




 Here's what I'm talking about! Asian women (and Asian men too, actually) are objectified as hell nowadays with this yellow fever thing, and calling them exotic is not helping them, since when this word is used to describe them, they are seeing as an object to gain pleasure from. That's all I meant! No words cary a negative quotation on their own, there's history. And that's one of them. If exotic was used for foreigners, then this word would be attributed to my race as well. But whoops, my race is not seen as attractive or as a "thing to gain pleasure from", so we're not called exotic that much. 

Thanks for understanding!  




 How small is your butt if you can access your butthole while standing up?  




 I think what people don't like is this idea that we should stick to gender. I honestly want to be a housewife. Looks like the only thing I would enjoy doing for the rest of my life. But if another girl wants to be a mechanic and her husband wants to be a stay-at-home dad, go for it!  




 Parents have become so paranoid lately, plus they get shamed if they date leave their children outside. Someone "dared" leaving their six-year-old to play soccer in the streets one day (she was on Judge Judy) and she was shamed for doing it. "Who leaves their 6 year old out in the street anyway?" and other relevant phrases questioning her parenting skills, etc. Kid was six and was with much older children. They were in a suburban neighborhood. How dangerous could it be really  




 Yo this free speech right is getting out of hand ... 




 Obviously not everyone from the same country eats the same thing. Like I could say a North American breakfast consists of eggs, bacon, OJ and toast, but my family never ate those. 

Typically, Germans eat lots of bread, usually with ham and cheese for breakfast and dinner. And the people I live with happen to live a pretty typical german life (at least food wise).  




 Yo I'm not gonna threaten you with a gun to change your vocabulary chill man y'all are acting like I asked you to change your belief.  




 I totally understand and know that. But it's wrong to assume everyone is okay with something.  




 Ha yeah I could definitely do that as well : ) I'm just really shy about it. If it were for me, I would be eating all of their Frischkäse and Reiswaffeln. But I'd feel bad, to be honest.  




 I understand. There are exceptions to all rules. I just think it's disrespectful to just assume everyone you meet are part of that exception. Like I'm pretty sure some foreigners like to be called exotic, but most don't. So why act like it's totally fine to use that word for everyone.  




 I'm no angel. It is something I am trying to change about myself. I didn't think it was a problem until the group of people who have the feature I find beautiful said they hated said feature to be seen as beautiful so much.  




 Man I wish I were upperclass and sheltered from real life. Maybe I wouldn't know there are still selfish pricks out there who lack so much respect, they refuse to alter their heavily insulting vocabulary with negative quotations for the benefit of others.  




 It's weird how that bothers me so much, but I absolutely hate how they open doors in GTA V. That's literally my number one complain. Why would you come from a cutscene, have Michael drunk as fuck or whatever, walking like he about to collapse, then he opens the door like he's trying to escape the police. All. The. Time. 




 I guess we are from two different worlds then. I never heard the word exotic used in a positive way. It's either "That object/animal is exotic", or "That exotic chick ... you think she suck dick?" kind of way. And said "exotic chick" doesn't mean any foreign girl. She just happens to come from a country people find the people attractive in a sexual way.  




 Yeah definitely. Still looking for a snack i'd enjoy though : ) 




 Yeah, you got a point there. Humans like to do that. But since we know it can be frustrating to the people that are being objectified, I thought we'd eventually stop it.

Guess not.  




 Thanks for using retarded and ocd in the same sentence as a mean to insult people. Shows your character.  




 Nah. It would be seen as foreign.

 




 No. Caribbean.  




 What? Your sentence about Asian girls had no sexual quotation to it, while the sentence about tall guys being hot has one. That's like saying "Black people are so dark." and then comparing it to saying "Short girls are hot." One is an observation, the other one is you telling me what you find physically or sexually attractive.  




 Sometimes. But I guess it's because they have their heavy meal mostly outside, so they don't cook much during the week.  




 The adjective can be as well, but yeah the noun definitely is.  




 Northern Asia (Japan, Korea) is pretty westernized, if you ask me. Probably more Westernized than Canada. 

Or if you're talking about Geography, Spain is Western, yet considered exotic.  




 Nope, never was personally called exotic thankfully. It is, however, an issue with many people I've talked to.  




 Not trying too hard, I don't see why it's such a big deal to not use that term if some people don't like it.  




 But sexual orientation just means you're attracted to x sex, not y. Doesn't mean you can't enjoy other form of sex. Like Asexuals don't feel sexual orientation towards people. Doesn't they can't enjoy sex. It's just a matter of who you're attracted to.  




 What. How is "Asians girls are so skinny" objectifying? On average, they are ... 




 To put it simply, fetishizing is thinking "That thing about that person is hot!" (exclamation point to show excitement or whatever) while attraction is more like "That person is hot."  




 I understand, but truthfully, would you call someone from England exotic? A German? Someone from Canada (if you're out of Canada). Exotic is primarily used for courtliness that are "known for having pretty women", so Southern Asia usually or some parts of Madagascar for instance.  




 Why y'all not giving the full definition though. 




 I lived in a country that was 95% the same race (mine), and foreigners were just called foreigners (even when the Chinese came, they were just ... Chinese), then in a country (Canada) that was 85% White. Never heard the word "exotic" used besides when white men talk about how they want to sleep with a Thai woman.  




 Yep, that's definition number one. How about definition number two? And yes it's a matter of political correctness. I think if someone doesn't want to be referred to as a specific word (since it is about them), then fine.  




 That seems so little to me. And eating so much bread also seems like quite a lot. 

Oh well.  




 I'm not sure you read what you just wrote.  




 ... I don't think you understood the point of my comment but okay. 

For those who want to be picky, I'll just quote the dictionary.
 adjective
• originating in or characteristic of a distant foreign country: exotic birds | they loved to visit exotic places. ** primary definition often used with animals or objects**

• attractive or striking because colourful or out of the ordinary: youths with exotic haircuts | (as nounthe exotic) : there was a touch of the exotic in her appearance. ** secondary definition used to describe physical attributes.** 




 Like Americans. Three heavy meals a day. I'm okay with skipping breakfast, but then yeah. I don't think North Americans have "light" meals. You just eat a meal or you have a snack. 

As for Germany, if I were to eat like my host family heat, it would be bread/ham/cheese morning, a meal for lunch, then bread/ham/cheese in the afternoon.  




 Not the same, because humans are animals that are attracted to physical appearance as well (like many other animals. A lioness thinking the lion with the biggest mane is the one she wants to mate with is not objectifying, she's just doing what her brain has been wired to do for generations). Now if you have fetish for tall people, that's something else (and people who find "exotic" people hot are usually fetishizing them). 




 Exotic is a word you use to describe birds, or food, but using it on humans is dehumanizing. Also, it carries this "it's so hot/it's my fetish" type of connotation as well, which is another reason why it should not be used with people. A foreigner is a foreigner. If all foreigners were really called exotic, then we wouldn't be hearing that word attributed to specific regions (like South-East Asia).  




 Meh. I'd hate to know that my sexual orientation is seen as "adventurous" or "hot", rather than something I cannot change about myself. It's like when White people call some foreigners "exotic" and they think it's hot. It's rather objectifying. 




 Yeah I guess the main reason is that I don't really call bread and cheese "a meal". It feels more like a snack. Something to give you just the right amount of energy while you wait for an actual meal, you know?  




 Hey this will sound like a weird question, but anyone having a hard time adjusting to German's eating habits? I'm North American and I do fit the stereotype that says "We eat more than we need to" but I certainly feel underfed in Germany. Long story short, I feel like I only eat one real meal a day. I never feel full at the end of the day. Also, I am slightly picky with snacks and I cannot find the things I'm used to eating here (but that's not a problem I mean what do I expect from being in another country).

Anyone feeling slightly underfed? Maybe not underfed as that's quite a dramatic way of putting it, but anyone feeling like they're eating way less than they're used to? 

I know, I can go buy myself food and do the groceries, but I don't make much money and eating out every afternoon is costly, plus being a guest in someone's house doesn't give me the right (in my opinion) to hog their kitchen space.  




 Not yet. Maybe tomorrow though.

Though this morning I am feeling slightly better, but I'm scared to eat. I've been burping a lot, and with nausea, that usually means I may still throw up. :/ 




 I don't know how interesting sickness is but for the past three weeks or so I've been having daily headaches, and today they were paired with nausea. I thought throwing up would mean instant relief, I was wrong. Ended up spending the entire afternoon sleeping. Woke up a few minutes ago (it's almost 1:30 am) and still feeling quite terrible, light-headed at times, and this headache situation has not settled. What I regret the most is throwing my sheets in the washing machine some time before throwing up, meaning now that they're all clean I have to make my bed and I'm feeling so weak (but I'm on the computer ...) 




 I have so many ideals. 

In my most perfect ideal future, I would be rich, a stay-at-home mother with 6+ children, and maybe with a husband. Living in Europe (France, England or Germany) in a nice house. Once all my children are 6+ years old (or 5+ if we're in England), I'll go back to work, but part-time if I'm in Germany (mornings only). Then during lunch, I have a lunch date with my children, since apparently in Europe, your child can get out of school during lunchtime. 

In my more realizable ideal, I'm a single mother with two or three children. Location still a unknown, since it would depend on which decision I take now (right now I'm hesitating between staying in Germany or moving back to the US or Canada). I am someone who works with either deaf/deaf-blind children, or children experiencing behavioral difficulties. But, I would work in a school, just so I can have the same breaks as my children. No cars, just bikes. We'd be the type of family who would go to the museum at least once a week, go to the park every afternoon after dinner, and who would have lunch in a café from time to time. 

I think the second ideal is the one I am aiming for the most. It's realizable, it's simple, and it just seems like the type of life I would enjoy.  




 I have the same issue! I love notebooks, but when I'm out of school, I have no idea what to do with them. In the past, I've had notebooks in which I wrote "tweets I would write if I were someone else", usually celebrities but also imaginary people. I used to be into writing but lately not so much, so writing rather short lines seem to work fine. Also, very recently I started using Blender (3D content creating program) so I use my newest notebook for inspiration for that. I think I will also write like German stuff in it, since I'm learning the language, and writing by hand seems more effective when trying to remember something. 

Like /u/DarkXuin said, it's always impressive to have someone with a notebook filled with scholarly stuff, like math (easier to spot).  




 Babies at the age of one are usually into destroying stuff. However, soon enough (or maybe already) they get into stacking, so get them stacking cups! Also, books. Always books with lots of images she's familiar with but that aren't boring. Like animals! Many babies also start getting into playing pretend, so a toy phone, toy keys, toy cards ... anything mommy and daddy does that she might want to do as well. 

I don't recommend buying clothes since it's so personal (style, fit, etc.) unless the parents explicitly tell you it's okay to buy them that. Also, kids grow up so fast, so getting an expensive-ish piece of clothing is like throwing away money.  




 Eh. Babies are quite clever, actually. They always figure things out we take for granted.  




 Coming from a 3rd world country, I gotta say ... the western media is dramatic as hell. Of course, Canada (I lived there as well) is much safer than Mexico in general, but Mexico is not a hell hole. You're not going to get killed, you're not going to get raped. Just be smart about your every move. Don't venture in the streets too late at night, don't go places where you know they're not used to seeing tourists, especially since you're clearly a foreigner. If you're a girl, try not to be on your own. Don't go to areas where there are tons of crimes (again, usually areas where tourists don't go to). Going to foreign country shouldn't be an excuse for you to be less vigilant. Pretty sure wherever you are in Canada, there's an "unsafe" part of town, and I'm pretty sure you've been there and survived. As for foreigners being robbed, try going to Paris for a week and see how easily pickpocketed you will get. 

As for natural happenings, it's a tropical country. Of course it's going to rain. Monsoons aren't so bad. In fact, they're pretty fun, as long as you don't venture around a place where a current could drag you to the ocean or something. Hurricanes and other more important 'disasters', there are plenty of warnings, especially in a country like Mexico where there are tourists all the time. 

Seriously. If a country is really unsafe, you wouldn't easily find a way to travel to it. You would be bombarded with warnings while trying to purchase tickets. Mexico is not one of them. Of course, it's really unsafe in certain places, but the entire country is not a war zone. 

Oh, and HAVE FUN! It's a great country. Tons of friendly people, yummy food everywhere. Don't use too much toilet paper though! Their toilets are easily clogged (learned this the hard way)! 




 I adore routine. I dropped out of college four months ago in order to go overseas, so my life has been off a routine for a while ... then I decided to go back to one.

I am taking care of a small child, and with me, he's on a "strict" schedule. 8 am, we get ready to go to the playground, 9:30 snack, 10:15 nap time, lunch whenever he wakes up (I am off duty at 12:30, usually he wakes up then). Then, I eat dinner way later in the evening, then shower at midnight, and straight to bed. When I have to look after him in the evening, he eats dinner at 5:30, 6:30 we start our bedtime routine, and by 7, we're in his room, trying to get him to fall asleep, preferably before 7:30. Every single day. Sometimes I stop and realize wow ... we do the same thing all the time. I think he's too young to get tired of it, but still. I personally really love routines. At least I don't have to think too much about what might happen next. But I'm trying to be a little flexible from time to time anyway.  




 The pizza sub is my go-to sub, to be honest. I love anything from tomatoes, so I would ask for extra marinera sauce and extra tomatoes. When they grill it so perfectly that the cheese stays melted for a long time, it's like biting into heaven. Yum!  




 I'm West Indian, and honestly I don't know how often people eat this, but at least my family does.

We have this root called manioc (so I googled it to see how it's spelled, it's also called cassava) and aside from using it as an ingredient in various dishes, my culture also likes to use it as a starchy lotion. I was covered in this thing when I got chicken pox. So the way you do it, you grate it into a powder, you wet it, then you let it dry. If you want to use it as a lotion, you let it dry on yourself. When you let it dry, it has a clay-like texture. 

Well, sometimes, we (my family, at least) would eat it. I honestly thought it was common but I had my friends try it one day, and they hated it. A few of them were from the same country as me, and they just threw the thing away.  




 Sure was! With Leah Miller and Matt. Man. I miss these two. MusiquePlus had the French equivalent, the titled is a literate translation (Plus sur commande). These shows were really awesome, and the VJs were really what made those channels so worth it. 

MuchMusic had another favorite of mine: Video on Trial. That thing was funny!  




 I think so. I have anemia, and apparently people with anemia are prone to pica. Plus my mother, who also has anemia, had more "traditional" pica cravings, such as dirt and clay.  




 Where I lived most of my life (Montreal, Canada) there was this TV channel called MusiquePlus. It's like MTV. Before the internet and YouTube became super popular for music, circa 2006-2010, it was one of the few music sources we had. Every song from that era reminds me of MusiquePlus. Back then, I think most people had a various taste in music, since you had to sit through different genres if you were to watch those channels. It was magical. And back then, even music shows were interactive. Like you could text a message  and it would appear on the screen. Questions were answered by the host.

The English-Canadian version of it was MuchMusic. Just as magical. It was one of the things that helped me learn English. Every Spring Break, they had a show called (surprise!) Spring Break. I don't Lim partying, alcohol and whatever things people do when drunk, but sometimes this show was fuuuuny! Some 'party' songs remind me of that show and all of MuchMusic as well.

Good times. 




 Pretty sure I won't find anyone here who does this but I eat flour. Yes, raw flour. I buy a small bag, put a spoon in it and dig in whenever. Lately I've been putting drops of water in, wait for it to dry, then eat the chunky bits.  




 My hands are always on my thighs. Always. It's just comforting. 




 I know. I'm sorry I loosely explained what I meant. Asian diaspora, at least from personal experience, call it Chinese New Year.At least they do where I lived. 




 It is. In a sense, you are two things. You are your thoughts and your 'body'. Your body doesn't depend on your thoughts at all, since most other species do not have thoughts as developed as ours (from what we know), and they still survive well.

If you look at some dogs, their body is telling them to hoard and hide his bones "just in case". If a dog could sit down and rationalize its situation, it would realize that his human will most probably not touch his bones, and it will most probably never run out, so it doesn't need to hide them. 

Saying "My body needs" would just be too much words, and would become easily redundant. So yeah.  




 Same with Canada and the US. Hashtags everywhere. Each show has one. Actually, sometimes some segments of shows after their own hashtags. Like in a cooking show, if someone had raw eggs, at the bottom of the screen, you'll see #raweggs or something like that. And I think most reality TV shows with a narrator have like "'Like' us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter" some time during their airing time. Or they'll just have a page with a bird, an 'F', a 'G+' even. It doesn't really bother me but I can see how it may annoy others.  




 It's still called Chinese New Year though, and they celebrate it the same way. Little Red Enveloppes with money, greetings to grandparents and words of wisdom exchanged. Seollal in Korea was based off Chinese literature, and Tết in Vietnam is from the vietnamese variation of the Chinese calendar. Same origin. 




 Not really. In order for your body to survive, you do need water, food, etc. Now, your body does want to survive, simply because that's its purpose. If you ever go through this hell people call "almost dying" (I hope you never do), you'l realize how much your body will not give up, and will do anything to keep you alive. 

Now. Of course you don't need to be alive. Everything that is doesn't need to be here. But since they're there and we can't really do anything about it, they become useful or necessary. Like the sun. Extremely important. Water. Oxygen. Etc. The problem is humans and their thoughts. It's like our consciousness is not governed by the laws of nature (thought it is, just with a lot of freedom). We think too much, we question existence, we doubt our purpose, etc. It's not bad at all. It's actually good. Questioning everything is how we've learned so much about the world around us. 

But yeah. Philosophy and biology shouldn't be mixed. Biology is just. There. No thoughts behind it. So it should just 'be'.  




 I didn't know I had one until very recently. And the weird part is, I can't smell this smell anymore.

I live with a host family in Germany, and one day I was having quite a shitty day. I entered their apartment after going grocery shopping and I smelled "them". I don't know how to put it. I thought I smelled their presence. 

Well, they weren't home. They both work during the day. But at that moment, their 'smell' was so comforting. Like I was getting hugged and comforted by something or someone. It only lasted a few seconds though. But it felt really great. 

I wish I could feel this way again. 

Edit: Whoops! Did you mean "bad smell" by odor? I'm sorry. If that's the case, I guess my favorite is the smell of scotch tape! : ) 




 I nap almost every day! Usually 3 hours, though I wish I could do short naps (since you apparently wake up less drowsy). And lately I've been having headaches every day, and since they don't seem to go away, I try to sleep as much as possible just so I can forget about the pain for a few hours. 

I've had some short naps, like during longish car rides (30 minutes to one hour). I always woke up feeling so much better.  




 I'm an only child and my parents still had a favorite that wasn't me haha. Usually a friend's *oh so perfect* daughter.  




 Though to be fair, the Chinese New Year is celebrated by other Eastern Asian countries, from Korea to Vietnam.  




 Yay thanks! Gloomy days are just the best!  




 Lucky you! I wish I were sitting on a bus (maybe more the train, but they're on strike where I am) while it's raining and gloomy. Here it's a little overcast, it had rained a bit (a little drizzle for one minute or so) and the sun comes out from time to time. Sorry that sounds weird but can you take a picture of the weather? :D 

And, I am doing laundry. Not too exciting, but I find doing laundry relaxing. My head has been quite sensible lately and thinking too much enhances my migraine. So laundry is just perfect! : ) 




 Thank you so much! That is really helpful of you!  




 On the brink of puberty, I remembered that, and it pissed me off! My parents raised me in a way as if I were expected to be perfect, *like them*. As if the way they're raising me, I was guaranteed to have no problems whatsoever, to have my shit together. To be perfect. Then with puberty came a string of problems I couldn't help, and they were always on my back, always mad at me, wishing they had another child, never proud of me (and they've admitted that so many times).

Then I became overly aware of their problems. Then I noticed my parents can't even deal with on another (clashing personalities), etc. I noticed they are both quite lonely. Both living sad lives, even though my father is accomplished and my mother seems to enjoy what she's doing. But for some reason, I can't feel any pity. Not because I'm cold hearted (okay, maybe a bit) but because I'm still salty about my childhood. I don't understand why they were so rough and rude to me, and cared so little about my problems. If parents aren't going to care about their child, sorry but said child might as well not care about their parents' problems.  




 Not always. First, finding the right treatment for an individual is difficult. Then, said treatment must be paired (or not) with the right thing in order to actually work. Then, said treatment must actually work in the long-term, because some just work for a short moment. Nothing is easy with any mental problems or disorders.  




 Then it's not just Tumblr. It's everyone. The word "depressed" nowadays is synonym to sad. And you don't need to have PTSD to have triggers. I mean, say you're kind of sad, then you see someone talking about suicide ... you may, out of the blue, think about suicide yourself. Or when it comes to food, you may be having a hard time to help your cravings, then you see someone describing their dinner and you're just like "Wow, you know what, I'm hungry." and you end up overeating. 

I don't know how many of people who like to describe Tumblr actually go on Tumblr ... it's like any other websites, including Reddit. Its demographics happen to be mostly teenage girls, and for some reason, everyone hates teenage girls on the internet ... 




 Whoa thanks for the link!  




 I do not live in New York. It's a picture I saw online a while ago. Plus I haven't been in NYC in ages ... But I think telling me the area is good enough. Thank you! : ) 




 Thank you! : ) 




 Thank you very much!  




 Looks pretty similar!

And wow if you were to do this, I would be extremely thankful!  




 I don't know. I've had depression for a while and calling it easily treatable, as if it were a cold, is the same as what you're describing as annoying. I'm on Tumblr all the time and I notice people complaining about the romanticization of mental illnesses, but it's such a small group of people who do that (like the romanticization of cancer after the movie "Fault in our Stars".

But honestly. It irritates me when people think depression, anxiety, or OCD, PTSD ... whatever, is easily treatable. Everything related to psychology is like bargaining. It's a "guessing" science, so there's no way it's easy to even be diagnosed with anything. 

Please reconsider your opinion, or maybe your choice of words. 




 Thank you! : ) 




 Hello,

I have found [this absolutely beautiful picture](http://a.wattpad.com/userbg/audreystav.54492.jpg) some time ago, and I promised myself to go to that exact same spot during the sunset, one of those days. 

I don't currently live in NYC, if that changes anything.

Thanks in advance!   




 Removing my braids. I have [these](http://www.poeticjusticebraids.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/box-braids-hairstyles-2014-pictures.png) on (not my picture), which are essentially braided hair extensions. I put them on as a protective hairstyle so my hair can rest a bit. I cannot wait to remove them.  




 The news show what people want to see. I remember after Haiti's Earthquake, after day 2, non-Haitians people stopped watching the news or reading the newspaper because "That's all they're talking about!". Reason is, where I used to live, there was a huge Haitian community so the news was flooded with just that, but other nations were really unhappy about it. 

Nepal is too far away and doesn't have that huge of a diaspora for the Western world to relate and to truly care.  




 It's 10 pm and I'm googling weather or not orange juice can cause migraines. I drink between 500 ml and 1L of it every day (I know, it's bad but I'm so picky with my beverages) and I also have daily headaches/migraines. 




 (breaths in) *tch*! 
I have this terrible habit of silencing my sneezes. It's apparently bad for you. I don't know why I can't not do it.  




 I don't question my gender. I mean I don't think I'm genderqueer at all. I say I'm a girl simply because it matches my sex. I think if I were to wake up tomorrow XY but with the memory of being a female, I'd have no trouble at all calling myself a man. 

However, I do not relate to my gender much. I don't do the things I'm expected to do stereotypically, like makeup, the typical "girl" fashion sense, "girl" interests, etc. Not really by choice, I just don't care for it. I'd cut my hair short if I wasn't so self-conscious about the shape of my face. I would wear suits if I wasn't so self-conscious about going shopping. I would totally do jobs seen as "manly" if, again, I wasn't so damn self-conscious. Heck, I'd grow a beard if I had the capability to do so! I just do stuff I know won't attract attention, so if you were to see me in the streets, I would look like any other girls.
