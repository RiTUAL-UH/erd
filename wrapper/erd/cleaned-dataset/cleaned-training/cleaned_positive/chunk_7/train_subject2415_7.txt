 Well, they're fun to squeeze and stuff... 




 I learned that while in the hospital being treated for depression, so if you want to find it online, feel free. That's not where I learned it. 




 Children of one alcoholic parent are 50% more likely to be addicted to substances. 




 Okay, but I don't even want to drink when I'm of age, so I obviously don't want to do pot or anything else. I come from a family of alcoholism, so it's more likely for me to become addicted. It's not worth it. 




 Breasts don't make me feel like "a beast with a mane." 




 lol, her handwriting is crap. 




 no worries, i got it. i just like to brag about what a good kid i am :P 




 lol, not me. i'm a singer and a dancer; my body is too important to me to put poisons in it. 




 Holy crap, pre-cal and you're thirteen. THAT'S AMAZING!

But I understand the feeling. I eventually learned to not care what my parents or anyone else expected or wanted of me, but for my goal to be proud of myself. Now I hold myself to a high standard and am happy with who and where I am. I have room for improvement, but I know that, noone is telling me it. I know it's easier said than done, but I did it and it feels amazing.

*hugs* 




 Fifteen, and never touched the stuff. Never will. 




 [How I feel reading this thread...](http://data2.whicdn.com/images/36428642/tumblr_m9mwckWbYT1rfolixo1_500_large.gif) 




 That shouldn't matter. If he/she cares, you either don't know them well enough or are going after the wrong person. 




 As a girl feeling really lonely this time of year, I second this. 




 I'm a girl. I feel left out too. 




 Seinfeld is pretty awesome. 




 Oh wow, this is GORGEOUS! Thanks for sharing! 




 Really? 




 That's awesome! Always have goals in place. If you just keep going without a set goal, it makes it harder.

You know, I'm not one of those people who were really addicted or anything, but I feel more in control of myself. I feel proud and clean to say that I don't masturbate. 




 Thanks! 




 You too(: 




 Let's do it together(: 




 Thank you(: 




 Yay! That's great, congrats! Keep pushing, it's so worth it! 




 Congrats! 




 Hell yeah! I'm proud of us too. Let's do this! 




 Yes. 




 Well, it's actually been pretty easy this run, but still looking forward to more ease! Thanks so much(: 




 Try flipping the pic and reposting. 




 Best of luck! My advice is to keep yourself as busy as possible. When you do, it kind of flies by! 




 Awesome quote, very helpful. Thanks for sharing! 




 Yay! Nothing to say, just felt like sharing(: Have a good day! 




 Omg, I meant to say month... I don't know what's wrong with me. 




 It gets easier and feels shorter as time goes on. Just keep yourself busy and it will make your journey a *lot* easier. 




 Awesome! Nothing to say, just felt like sharing(: Have a good day!

**EDIT:** Oh my gosh, I meant to say month... Woops. 




 Oh, okay. I had that happen to a friend. Sorry to hear. 




 wrong sub 




 Ow. What'd you do? 




 *That's* your running late makeup? Not fair. You're so gorgeous. 




 Thanks for reading. 




 Hmu if you need some help. 




 Hey, congrats on four weeks! 




 Thanks(: 




 Tonight, I was tempted for the first time in my longest streak ever, and something changed. The feelings were between mild and strong and the demons were tempting me (metaphor), but... I didn't give in. I was strong. Usually no matter how small the temptation is, I give in.

I'm changing. ... I'm changing! Holy crap, I'm actually becoming a better person!

I never felt as if my life was changing until now. I just decided that I would be better off if I quit, and now I realize why! I'm actually changing my life.

Be strong in your journey, even when it's seemingly impossible. **You can change too.** 




 Are you joking? 




 /r/NoFap is an absolutely wonderful community. I'm currently on day 27 of my streak and feel so much more wholesome and pleasing to God. I highly suggest you check it out. I had been struggling with thinking about quitting, but this community helped me make the jump. Please check this out, it does wonders!

I would like to add that there have been times where I felt like God was always by my side and times where I couldn't *feel* Him at all. That's okay. I understand the fear; I have felt it too. That's kind of what faith is about. Believing and following through thick and thin. Don't think that He has abandoned you just because you feel more distant. It doesn't happen for a specific reason that I know of. He will always be here for you. And we're here for you too. 




 It's really not bad, but I'm glad you asked because airy sound is my biggest pet peeve. When you sing, focus your sound forward. Imagine you sound is a laser beam and it shoots straight into the ridge in the front of your mouth where it goes from flat to a hill by your teeth. (I hope that made sense...) Also, picture your sound as a laser beam and not a flashlight. These things sound weird, but then can almost automatically improve your sound(: 




 Oh damn... I was not expecting that. 




 He's also wearing Heeleys. 




 Omg, it's you from the towel turban thread! Lol small ~~world~~ subreddit :P 




 and a half... 




 Warm up everyday. Push yourself further and further out of your comfort zone. While warming up, crescendo the entire phrase. I know this isn't awesome advice, but the best I can provide through a comment and without actually hearing you. 




 [Finally, I can show off my purple towel!](http://imgur.com/zehGhgi) 




 What the hell? I took Geometry my freshman year and it was so damn hard... Serious jealous vibes going your way. 




 Remember when you could rewind a YouTube video without having to reload the entire page? 




 So much better. Very nice look on you! 




 Wow! These are amazing!! We're so happy for you(: 




 I'm trying(: Best of luck to you as well! 




 Great idea! Tails. 




 Welcome, we're glad to have you! My advice is 1) Keep yourself busy. If you're too busy doing something, your mind doesn't have time to make you fall. If you're feeling the urge to relapse, take a walk, call up a friend, do *something*.  2) Your body will trick you. The reason that I have relapsed before is that when you get really turned on, your body will tell your brain that you don't want to get turned off, distracted, whatever. *But that is wrong.* Whenever you feel the tiniest urge and your body is telling you how nice it is, get busy or come here to NoFap.  3) This is more of a personal idea, but I don't think cold showers are very helpful. For some people they are, but to me, the last thing I want to do is get naked and alone. If it works for you, great, but it never worked out for me personally.  4) Post or read as much as possible. This journey is so much easier when you know someone out there is rooting for your success.  5) Your relapses suck, but they make you stronger in the end. If you fall, pick yourself up and vow to make your next streak longer. The worst thing you can do for yourself is accept your failure, but then *continue* to fail.


Well, hope you enjoyed that wall of text. Good luck! Best wishes! 




 You know, I can't say that I've really noticed much. I wasn't hardcore addicted when I started here, but I chose to quit because of my faith. I never even felt *that* bad doing it, but I'm glad to know that I can control myself. I don't have to listen to what my body wants. 




 Glad I could help(: 




 Congrats! 




 Well, it's not an actual split, but that is a cool gif. 




 Glad I could help(: 




 My secret. **Keep. Busy.** I have been so busy these last few weeks I didn't even notice how much progress I've made. I should be proud of myself, but it's been so easy.

So, if you're feeling tempted, go for a walk, call up a friend, do something to take your mind off of it. When your mind tells you that you don't want to be distracted, rise above it. Be a better version of yourself everyday.

I love you guys. Stay strong. 




 My thoughts exactly. 




 Mine are too, now that I think of it. Thanks for sharing. 




 Sorry man. Best of luck to you and your girlfriend! 




 Wow, this was awesome. Thanks for sharing! 




 Sophomore here. All I want is some damn sleep... I have so much on my plate right now I feel like I could break down at any minute. So many of my classes I have assignments to do, papers to write, projects to finish, but I don't understand anything that I"m doing. I don't know if this helps at all, but **you're not alone**. We're here suffering with you. Trudge on 3 




 Okay, thanks(: 




 Wow, thanks(: I also have one question. Does it really prime like it says it does, or should I continue to use my primer with it? By the way, I have oily skin. Thanks again, this was really helpful(: 




 Do you have a drugstore foundation that you would suggest over them? 




 Hello lovelies,

I'm going to pick up some foundation tomorrow, and my favorite YouTube makeup artist switched from Colorstay, what I'm using now, to the 3-in-1 foundation. I don't really have any problems with the Colorstay, but our skin is very similar and I was considering making the switch. Have any of you tried one or both, and do you have a preference? Thanks(:

EDIT: Sorry, typo. I meant **Revlon Colorstay**. The 3-in-1 is Covergirl. My bad. 




 With the right guys, I think we could build a better view of women altogether! but that's quite ambitious(: 




 I'm right there with ya sister. Yw(: 




 It definitely was(: 




 Oh man... Girl, you have some be-U-tiful eyes!! Love this look! I would try sharpening up your brows a bit, though. The subtle filling makes them look a little messy. 




 Woow. You are gorgeous! Even in bad lighting, I absolutely love this look. Plus I'm super jealous of your brows. 




 You are so pretty! I think you did great(: Keep posting! 




 You are so sweet!! I love hearing from guys on this subreddit. Glad you enjoy it! Would love to see your gf join us(: 




 Wow, this looks like an awesome liner! Thanks(: 




 I'm on Chrome and it doesn't work and never has. 




 He has the exact same voice as Will Smith. 




 No way he's over 18... 




 Not cringe-worthy at all. Just funny. 




 Awesome, thanks so much(: 




 Wow, sounds great! Thanks(: 




 I got that one in white and it was very crumbly and I kind of hated it... Thanks for the suggestion, though. 




 Yeah, I've been looking at that one this afternoon, and it looks really awesome. Still deciding if I want to dish out the money for it though.
