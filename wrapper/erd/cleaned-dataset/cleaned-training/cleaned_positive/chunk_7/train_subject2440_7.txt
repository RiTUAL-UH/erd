 Throwaway. I do this mostly to educate or dispel stigmata attached to homelessness and mental illness in the U.S.. I will not entertain any job offers or any form of assistance, cash or otherwise (thank you kindly just the same).

Some background:

* have slept outdoors for 23 months in a region where winters are very mild
* clean-cut, clean-shaven and well-enough-dressed. The only way you would know I'm homeless is if you stumbled upon me at my urban camp site
* laid-off from an okay job with benefits in April 2009 due to state budget cuts
* BA degree in Communication
* medicated for major depression, otherwise mostly healthy
* drug-free and sober
* possessions are only a sleeping bag, some clothes, a small backpack and a laptop with case
* I travel in the same circles as other homeless people but am acquainted with only a few. 




 Duty now for the future.
