 She's standing on the couch in the other room.  









 Medium yarn (4) knit in the round (70) then (22) rows main colour,  then (22) rows secondary colour.  There is 10 blocks of main colour and 9 blocks secondary.  Added the tasles at the end to join the ends. I used a size 16 round needle for the wntiee thing and a crochet hook for the tasles 




 Only yarn I could find at my local craft shop that fit the bronze was lion brand yarn in rust colour  




 Thank you! Of course the colours are perfect :)
