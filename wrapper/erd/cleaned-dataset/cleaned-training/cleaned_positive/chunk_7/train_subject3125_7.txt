 I'll get to it 




 Just watch the episode most of them ran, not all monsters are bad. 




 But does evolution apply to the supernatural world?  




 Most of the monsters ran they didn't stay and fight  




 Based on most of your comments, you could attract the positive end of a magnet

 Once I saw the clawed guy I was like deans going to mention Freddy Kruger  




 I liked bloodlines and stand behind it same as Jared and Misha. I feel like they could do allot with it, but the one thing I didn't like was the main hunter character kind of looked like drake but he was interesting and I felt he played his character well this is just my opinion and everyone has their own. 




 I really liked this episode and could stand behind this spin off I think it's going to be a success. 




 I liked it !  




 Probably a stupid question but how do you get those supernatural qoutes by your username when you comment?

 Well behavior like that would be from not being trained well my golden less than a year listens very well due to well training but he can get into trouble like any puppy would but all around a very good breed of dog! 



















 Wouldn't the human become sick during transformation and pretty much empty all the contents of his/her stomach?

 I don't want to drop it but when people (family) say I'm just being lazy, you're a low life and stuff like that.
