 I've been dating this guy for a couple of weeks and everything is going pretty well, except for the fact that he doesn't stop bragging about himself.

I won't disclose where he is from but he always brags about how his race/culture is the best and always goes out of his way to point out things related to his race. But, the thing is, we are currently in an interracial relationship (I'm asian).

Sometimes I feel a bit bad because he'd be bragging about his culture and I feel as if he's degrading me, because I can't really relate. And I'm beginning to wonder why he likes me in the first place and why he doesn't just find a girl from his culture.

I've asked him why he likes me and he says that first of all, he has "yellow fever" and thinks asian girls are the cutest. He also emphasizes intelligence and sense of humour. But does this make up for the fact that I'm not part of his race?

Am I just overreacting or is thing a legitimate issue?

Tl;dr: Boyfriend brags about his culture and I feel degraded for not being part of it.

 I've been dying my hair an auburn colour for the past 6 months and wanted to dye it a dark brown. I had about an inch of re-growth, which is black (asian hair). 

I used a de-red packet and a medium chocolate brown and the colour turned out really nice except that my roots didn't really take in any colour so I have a dark brown with a reddish tint on the dyed parts of my hair with black roots. 

How do I fix my hair so it is all one colour without dying it black? I want the colour on my roots to match my hair. 

Here's a picture of my hair now: http://i.imgur.com/p3NVGel.png
  




 My hair is originally a dark brown. Last year I dyed my hair red using L'oreal Hicolor but now want to return to my natural hair colour. I have about an inch of regrowth at the moment. 

Would it be okay if I just dyed my hair a dark brown with 20vol developer or would the red still show?
 




 Hi,

I am currently sponsoring my common-law spouse for his permanent resident papers. We have just submitted the application and won't hear from back until at least 6 months later.

Two years ago, he completed his diploma and have recently decided to go back to school to complete his bachelor's degree. So this means he has to apply for a student permit, which allows him to work for a maximum for 20 hours a week off-campus. His dad will be paying for his tuition since it is much higher for international students. Other than that, he has to support himself 100%. 20 hours a week will only make him ~$1000/month, which is definitely not enough to live off of. 

Does he have any other options to go back to school and be able to support himself other than waiting to receive his permanent resident card so he doesn't have to pay the international student tuition? He is definitely looking to apply to bursaries and scholarships.  




 I don't think English is OP's native language.  




 I gave her multiple belly rubs! She loved them! :) 




 Gonna try this out! Thanks for sharing :)  









 Me too. I cried when I saw this picture. First, it made me miss my cat. Second, I realized that if I die, I won't get to see these beautiful pictures anymore and even though there's so much shit in the world, there's this and it might just be enough to make up for everything else.
