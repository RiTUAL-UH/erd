 I've wanted an app that makes me solve derivatives and integrals (simple stuff) to turn off the alarm for a long time. Still haven't found one. 




 Team 60s put together the group for the purples. Let's beat the other colors and donate the most rice! We have so many people than the other colors, we can easily win it. For the purples!!

 In honor of Matching day. 




 In '91 they were probably still teaching penmanship.

Source: I was 12 in 2001 and still learning penmanship. 




 This is my general attitude as an adult. 




 Mine does this. It says no new people, and then an hour later I'll have 15 or so cards without changing any settings. I also live in a college town with 30,000 people close to my age. 




 Hahahaha you're my new favorite person in this sub. 




 I second this. 




 I sent a message to the mods of the Hand, earlier today. Did you not receive it? 




 Times have changed in the past 2 or 3 years regarding phones. Maybe it's because I'm older than college-age now, but nearly everyone I know has at least an iPhone 5 or Android equivalent. You can even get a decent pay-as-you-go Android phone at Walmart now for $50. 




 My college roommate was picky about locking the deadbolt. He would leave for the entire summer though, and that was my time to never lock the door. My then-boyfriend needed to get something out of my place one day while I was at work, so I told him to just go over and the door will be unlocked. I get a call from him saying it's locked. I immediately freak out. I check to make sure I don't have my keys on me, maybe I had absentmindedly locked the door or something. But I don't have my keys. In a panic, I leave work and go home. Sure enough, the door is locked. I starting freaking out, thinking there's been a robbery and the culprit was kind enough to lock the door behind him/her, except the interesting thing is that the handle isn't locked (like you can do by locking it while the door is open and then closing the door behind you), but the dead bolt is locked. I text my roommate, thinking maybe he's returned from summer break a few weeks early, but he's in another state. We think maybe the dog jumped up and hit the lock by chance, but ruled that out as the dog is a 15lb Pom with bad hips. So we wait for the maintenance guy to come unlock the door. I go in expecting to walk into the scene of a burglary, but see nothing amiss. My house keys are sitting on the door-side table, where I always leave them. I ask maintenance if they'd been in that day and they say no.

To this day, I still have no idea how the deadbolt got locked, with the only set of keys that could do the deed, locked inside. 




 generally lower res

Not anymore. Do you know what year it is? Also just tested camera time. The iPhone has that handy slide-up-the-lock-screen-to-get-to-the-camera feature. Less than four seconds from picking up my phone to snapping a clear picture of something across the room. 




 Sometimes the cats will stare at a random spot and then the dogs will start barking at that spot. That's usually my cue to leave the room. 




 As the largest group, we definitely have the best networking. And networking is the center of all good things that could happen to your professional career. As for parties, we don't think before we act, so the wildest things always seem to happen to us, over the more reserved colors. *"Did someone say drunken bicycle race?? Fuck yeah, let's do it!"* We are lacking in our philanthropic efforts, as we tend to think more of ourselves than anyone else, but we have joined a couple of alliances for the betterment of the Button community! That counts, right?

So... 1 year 0 months?

 I'm going to have nightmares for the rest of my life now. Excuse me while I curl up in the corner and cry as my eyes melt out of my skull. 




 u/kn0thing is one of us as well! Long live the 59s-ers!

Also, I can't imagine the wars going on at the reddit offices right now. 




 Well, our inevitable alcoholism as a result of pressing too early allows us a nightly drunken stupor. I guess that counts as sleep. 




 Please write a book. 




 I agree with what others are saying. Dating in general is nerve-wracking, and meeting a guy off the internet can be very scary, for a million different reasons, some of which are safety related. I prefer to talk to a guy for a couple of days (Tinder message or text) and then if I feel ready or comfortable with meeting him offline, I'll suggest a date. 




 This is the scariest thing I've read all day. 




 Why do you have an Apple logo next to your signal bars? 




 Reply with: nauseated* 




 I match with people I know all the time. If I see someone I know, I always swipe right just so I can give them shit about swiping right on me. It has revealed some actual intention though from guy friends who would probably never have pursued anything otherwise, so that sometimes gets a little weird.

Everyone's on Tinder nowadays. Laugh about it and move on. 




 [This is the worst kind of disappointment](http://i.imgur.com/hkLrD0x.png) 




 Do people even still download porn? 




 The names of the two companies I work for/with. 




 Thank you for saying this. My biggest annoyance is when people tell me there's nothing wrong with me because I don't seem like I'm having issues. Well, yeah, because I'm using up all of my mental energy to act like a normal human being. Sorry, not sorry.

I once broke up with a guy I'd been seeing because he casually mentioned that he didn't think mental disorders were a thing. He told me that depressed people just needed positive thinking, and that I was "locking myself into my disorder" because I had accepted that I had it. I'm surprised I didn't punch him. 




 [Same thing in Finder](http://i.imgur.com/qIFcGcA.png) 




 Breaking subreddit rule #3. Removed. 




 Um.. Yes, I'd like to inquire about ad space in the Daily Button? 




 Can confirm. I work with kids. They think anything having to do with butts is the most hilarious thing ever. 




 I agree with this. I'm on my computer non-stop from 9-5, and then I'm not on until later because 5pm is when I go run errands and be social and stuff. I think a better time frame would be around 10pm when we're all out of after-work things to do so we're home and bored and on reddit. 




 Have you joined your brethren at /r/59s? 




 How would that work? The bot account would have to have been created before anyone outside of reddit knew about the Button. Also, they still would only get one click. 




 Don't pretend to know the struggle that surrounds those of us who have/had the option to press. 




 Down with the Grey's! Do not let them oppress us! We will rise and take what is ours!

#Pressers unite! 




 I, /u/train_subject337, accept that I am, as a Purple, superior to all other colors because of my Button-granted right. In addition, I accept the Hierarchy of Purple and swear that my ultimate goal is to allow The Timer to reach Zero.

The Hand Shall Rise. 




 I watched it to the end... 59s forever! 




 "I work out all the time but I can't lose weight." 




 You're confusing prom with senior superlatives. 




 I honestly have no idea why that would be. I pressed it hastily as soon as I read the original reddit blog about it. Also, wouldn't it say 43s if I was cheater flair? 









 Purples reporting in. We hear that you're a spy. Care to have a chat about it? 




 I'm totally down with this idea. 




 Sounds like a personal problem. I know something that will help. 




 I found some just in that thread you linked:

 If we make their experience positive, it will give them false hope for the rest of the site. Might as well get them used to the abuse early on. 




 You broke it. 




 I'll still be here for you to mock. 




 [Oh, you](http://cdn.alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/happy-oh-stop-it-you-l.png) 




 I'm considering writing a research paper on it. I'd read a novel. Put some fact in there and I could use it as a reference in my paper. 




 I'm a math person. Numbers are fun. :) 




 It's all just fun arithmetic manipulation. 









 I sent you a PM from my alt, which is staying pure and true to the Assassin's cause. 




 Get out, you 60s elitist. 




 I can't change the 60s flair to something other than 60s. Can you guys add that feature? 




 Get out. 









 This is not the place for you.

59s for life! 




 Are we outnumbered by the 60s? I was under the assumption that we were the largest group. 




 You made a typo. 




 Hi everyone. I'm a lowly mod here at /r/59s. I didn't realize that we only got one click, so as soon as the page loaded, I clicked the crap out of that button. But I never looked back. Those of us who click without thinking are those of us who enjoy the fullest life. We take chances. We take risks. We strive to enjoy life no matter what the cost. Never apologize for being the first one to jump the gun, for we enjoy the most of what life has to offer.

We bleed purple. We are legion. We are 59s forever. 




 Come join us in /r/59s. Be with your 59s'er brethren!! 




 This is exactly what I was thinking. 




 [At least 20](http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/31709l/official_survey_of_the_buttons_religions_record/) 




 What? 




 I will do what needs to be done. Long live 59s. 




 Then come join us at /r/59s, a safe haven for all those who wear their 59s flair with pride. We WILL stand up and bask in our button pressing glory. We WILL NOT be oppressed by the elitist 60s'ers and sub-59s'ers.

**We will prevail!** 




 I am a proud 59s'er, and I disagree with your post. All button times are beautiful.

 #triggered #59sForLife #EffYourButtonTimeStandards /r/59s 




 If it doesn't reset fully every time, how do we explain all the 60s'ers? 




 Based on the events of the last several hours, it feels like a big social experiment. We're fighting amongst ourselves, but not in a Periwinkle vs Orangered way. This is a whole new way, with many more levels and opportunities for groups to break off from the pack.

Speaking of breaking off, join your 59s family at /r/59s. 




 Don't listen to these elitist 60s-ers. /r/59s. 




 Come join your 59s brethren over at /r/59s! Be proud of your flair! 




 I'll help! The Button has completely consumed my productivity at work anyway.

I'll be offline between 7 and 8pm EST, but will be on at all other times until I sleep around 2am.

**59s for life!**
