 I'll format it on that when I get home and update :)

I was hoping to oc the cpu I've heard people can get around 4.5ghz from the 2500k? So that's why I thought maybe a better cooler?

What speed RAM should I be looking at? 1333/1600 etc

I'd probably prefer front-side usb 3 as well just for convenience.

Cheers! 




 Hey guys trying to decide on a build I have a 24" 1080p monitor to use but considering on purchasing a 27" IPS screen later with a bigger resolution, I plan to play most games from new fps to things like wow, diablo 3 etc.

These are aussie prices I have from a local vendor near me so they will be a bit more than in US of A also limits my choices a bit! This is it,

Gigabyte ATI HD7850 2GB PCIe $277.20 

Intel Core i5 2500K Un-locked $229.90 

Seagate 2TB SATA3 7200rpm 3.5" $137.50

OCZ Vertex 3 2.5" 120GB SSD $201.30

Seasonic S12D 750W 80+ Silver $181.50

Coolermaster V6 GT CPU Cooler $72.60

Antec Nine Hundred Two V3 Case $134.20

Asus P8Z68-V-LE S1155 $161.70

Total: $1395.90 

I also need RAM but I'm not sure on that one yet because from this place I can only really get Kingston RAM and I don't see that mentioned much so may purchase that online. What would you recommend?

Also not really sure about motherboard either I want something I can run another card on later and with usb 3 support. The vendor has all asus boards but anything else u think is better throw it at me.

If I can get enough money I will swap for a 680GTX which would be ideal to SLI later but otherwise I will get another 7850 bit later and SLI with that, which is why I've gone with a slightly bigger PSU.

Well all advice will be appreciated so throw it at me!

Cheers reddit.
