 Rant: It took me forever to figure out my Alpha Hydrox lotion was breaking me out. I used the 10% glycolic acid one and it was causing me little whiteheads on my neck and side of my face. Boo! Giving my face a break from AHAs right now.

Also, though I do think my tea tree oil is helping reduce my acne flareup from the AHA fiasco, it definitely makes my skin feel tight. What I've been doing is using a dropper to put the oil mix in my hand, and then rubbing it on the spots. What I might end up doing is taking a q-tip and dabbing it on only the acne, and then waiting a bit. For what it's worth I did dilute it so it's 10% tea tree oil to mineral oil.

Also, I love my Cerave in the tub. It makes my skin feel great. I was going to switch to Cerave PM because it has niacinamide in it. But I just love the way the Cerave in the tub feels on my skin, and I really don't like how the Cerave PM feels lol. Agh! I'm picky about how stuff feels on my face. 

Just bought: Cerave PM, another Mint Julep Masque (looove it), Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion, Tea Tree Oil (which I'm diluting with mineral oil), Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Pack, the Mizon all-in-one snail cream, and a giant amount of sheet masks. 

Raves: My sunflower oil is perfect for OCM. I also mix in neem oil and I LOVE it. The smell doesn't bother me at all! I was considering purchasing some safflower oil and mixing the three together. 

I also just have to rave about Vaseline. God I love it. I have gotten used to sleeping with it on finally even though I mash my face into my pillow at night. Oh well. It still keeps me moisturized, and I like to put some on my feet, knees, and elbows too! Oh, and my knuckles. My hands have never been smoother, and they are always insanely dry and patchy during winter. Not anymore!

Also, my Thayer's Witch Hazel with Rose and Aloe. Gosh. This stuff smells SO amazing and makes my face feel so good. I was considering transferring it to a spray bottle and misting it on my face during the day. Now that I'm a super skin addict I've been going out quite a bit without any makeup on so I don't have to worry about screwing that up. 




 There isn't really a way to test it other than buying another product without similar ingredients and then patch testing. Did you use both the Vanicream and the Cerave Foaming cleanser at the same time? Or did you use them separately and they both caused breakouts? 




 Have you checked into starting a beginner routine in the sidebar? I would recommend looking at the acne-prone routine for recommendations.  




 The alcohol is a good idea! He's not super into steak but I can probably think of another fancy meal he would like.  




 We've been together about 7 months. I mean I would know what to get him for like a bday or christmas but Valentine's day is weird. With my last SO I never celebrated it. 

I think maybe I'll offer to cook a nice dinner and we can drink and watch movies. 




 I need some help with recommendations/product order. Here is my routine:

**AM**:

* Rinse face.
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel.
* Apply Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion (is this the western version of the gokujyun lotion?)
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Cerave in the tub if needed
* Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30


**PM**:

* OCM with sunflower oil and neem oil
* Cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser
* Thayer's Witch Hazel
* Stridex red box. Wait 20 minutes.
* Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion.
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Diluted tea tree oil as a spot treatment
* Cerave in the tub
* Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Mask
* Vaseline

How is my order? Do I apply the Hado Labo Lotion before I do my Stridex? Also, how do I use the Mizon sleeping pack? How much do I apply? I put a thin layer on and didn't feel like it was thick enough so I topped it off with Vaseline. Is that okay? Can I apply a thicker layer of the sleeping pack? Also, the bottle says to use it 2-3 times a week. Is that what I should be doing? I'm currently working on evening out my skin tone and fading some PIH (possibly PIE? I'm not sure). 

Also, I had to stop using my Alpha Hydrox Lotion as an AHA because it broke me out. Is there a good Asian alternative for an AHA? Or do I even need one? 

I'm looking to replace my Neutrogena when it runs out with an Asian sunscreen, preferably with SPF 50. What are some good suggestions? The Neutrogena is pretty thick and it makes my face look kind of greasy. 

I'm also looking for a spot treatment. What are some good Asian spot treatments? I have been using my tea tree oil for a few days now and it's okay. 

And what is pig collagen? I see it a lot when browsing for products. The packaging is super cute but what exactly is it? And what the heck is placenta? Is it actually placenta? Thanks for your help! I'm pretty new to this :) 




 Probably my neem oil, cerave in the tub, and sunscreen.  




 I want to do something nice for my SO for Valentines Day but I'm blanking on what I should get. I feel like you get a card and chocolates if you're a guy, but what do girls give the guys? 




 Lol this gif is adorable!  




 Baha this got me turned on too.  




 Oh my god. Gross. How selfish can you be!  




 I totally get this. I have issues going out with my boyfriend and his friends. I don't have any friends of my own so I feel pretty weird. It always makes me feel lonely when I'm with people because I feel so out of place. I wish I could enjoy socializing but I don't. 

Good luck tonight! 




 Nooooooo! That's too bad. Do you know why? I should check the ingredients!  




 Aw that's so sweet! I think I'd cry too haha.  




 When I used Alpha Hydrox I would apply it after my cleanser and then leave it on for 20-30 minutes, and then continue with my routine without wiping it off.  




 As long as it takes off your makeup fully it's fine. I personally use OCM to remove my makeup and then I use a foaming cleanser, but I wear pretty heavy makeup everyday and the only thing that removes my mascara is oil!  




 What's an alum block? You could be irritating your skin with too much exfoliation.  




 Interesting! I always suspected that certain chapstick dried out my lips!  




 Cool! I've been looking for a retinol. Do you really like the one you're using from PC?  




 Nice! Do you mean taut?  




 Interesting! I'll have to add this to my list of things to try.  




 Is the rosehip oil for moisture? I've heard it mentioned quite a bit on here. Does it do anything else for your skin?  




 I personally just use my cerave in the tub on my eyes and then top it off with vaseline to keep it moisturized. 

I know there are quite a lot of affordable eye creams recommended on /r/AsianBeauty. I really want to try the Mizon Snail Eye Cream. 

I think generally though most eye creams are just regular moisturizer!  




 Your skin looks great! What's your routine?  




 You monster.  




 It probably would if you are wiping oil off of your face. In that case if you are in direct sun I would reapply.  




 I don't see why you couldn't. I'd just check what ingredients are in them because they might potentially be irritating. Is there a specific tissue product you were looking at? 




 Why is Chapstick bad? 




 I would definitely cross post this to /r/makeupaddiction because they might be able to help with product reviews. I've never tried a brow or lash serum, but I know that removing all of my eye makeup has improved the appearance of my lashes! Maybe the same is true for brows.  




 It does irritate me because I spend a lot of time on the routine thread and see comments downvoted. I assume they are downvoted because someone disagrees with their advice. But then there is no explanation! I always upvote them.

I also feel like a lot of discussion topics are downvoted or no apparent reason :( 




 Okay, HOW do you know the difference between PIE and PIH from a photograph? I checked the sidebar info but it says you have to press down on the skin to test whether it's PIE or PIH. Am I missing something?  




 That's so true. I'm starting to be more active on the routine thread in helping people with product suggestions, but it's hard because something may break someone out that works for me! I guess it's always good to say your mileage may vary! 




 Awesome! Good luck to you. I had some issues with picking but with the amount of time and effort I spend trying to make my face look better, the desire to pick sort of just...fell away. Which is awesome, because I definitely have some scarring.  




 Yay! I'm going to give my skin a break from any AHA for a bit. I assume I don't *need* an AHA, but I did like how smooth the Alpha Hydrox made my skin. Although I do worry about sun damage even with a sunscreen. 




 Okay, I'll stick to my BHA once a day and see how that goes. I'm not currently using an AHA because the Alpha Hydrox broke me out. It was 10% so it's possible it was just too strong and irritated my skin. I might try the St. Ives pads since they aren't as strong! 




 When I only used cerave on my eyelids, they were still extremely dry. I'm not sure if there is something in the formula that dries out my eyes, but the cerave combined with vaseline helps a lot. 

You could look into an eye cream, but these generally have the same ingredients as a moisturizer repackaged and sold at a higher price.  




 Do you have an idea for what kinds of things break you out? I use cerave in the tub and it's great, pretty inexpensive.  




 You can! I haven't tried that. In that case it is recommended to only use a few drops if you apply it all over your face.  




 I don't, but if you search fatty alcohols on this sub you can find some recommendations. I believe Nivea Creme does not have fact alcohols actually  




 I've been posting pretty much everyday and I finally have a breakthrough thanks to ya'll! My routine included Alpha Hydrox 10% Glycolic Acid and this was totally what was breaking me out! How did I not see it before? 

I even posted quite a while ago about how I broke out weirdly on my neck and didn't even think it's because I used the Alpha Hydrox! 

Super happy to report that I have no new breakouts, and the little whiteheads that popped up are disappearing (thank you tea tree oil). 

My next question is... I like ahas. They make my face smooth an moisturized. What should I try next? And how do I know what exactly broke me out from the Alpha Hydrox? Also, is it okay to use my BHA twice a day, or will that be too drying? 

Thank you guys so much!!  




 It's possible the cetaphil is breaking you out. It has fatty alcohols you might be sensitive to. I'm not sure what ingredients are in the cleansing milk but I would start by replacing your moisturizer with something without fatty alcohols. 

Have you looked on cosDNA at all? There you can research your products ingredients to see about potential irritants. It's quite helpful!  




 So my eyelids tend to get quite dry as well, and the only thing that worked for me was to apply my regular moisturizer, which for me is cerave in the tub, and then apply a light layer of vaseline on top of that. This has eliminated the tight feeling and flakiness I had! 

I generally only have to apply the vaseline at night, but sometimes I do it in the morning as well.  




 Interesting! I should look more into it because I have quite a lot of what I believe is PIH, but very well may be PIE! Thanks for the information.  




 There is evidence that if you are exposed to sunlight, even through a window, that you are still susceptible to UV damage. So, based on that, your safest bet is to apply sunscreen every day, even if you are indoors at home.  




 It's possible your skin is very oily because it is dehydrated and over compensating by producing a lot of oil. Take a look at the dehydrated skin routine in the sidebar. 

I would moisturize twice a day and try the hydrating cleanser. Chances are you skin is quite dehydrated.  




 You could consult a dermatologist. They could provide some help if you have the insurance or money for it. 

As far as what you could do for your skin otc, I would recommend applying a good sunscreen, at least spf 30, and wearing it every day, even if it's cloudy or you aren't going outside. 

Second, AHAs are good chemical exfoliators to help reveal a better layer of skin underneath the current layer. This will help improve your skin's appearance to a degree. It won't work miracles but I will say your face texture will improve. 

I would also look into something like a vitamin C serum which will help with acne scarring or evening out your skin tone. You can look at other serums too, a lot of people like the Super Serum from silk naturals. 

I've heard retinoids are helpful as well for anti aging, but honestly I know nothing about them. You can do a search in this sub for retinoids and find some useful info. 

Lastly, you're the most critical of your skin. What you see in the mirror isn't what other people see. As far as the big pores, lots of people have them, and you'd never know because most people aren't that close to your face! So don't stress too hard. 

I hope that helps! 




 I don't know if your link is working correctly. I'm on mobile so maybe that's why but I couldn't see the images.  




 Here's mine!

* Mizon Returning Starfish Cream
* Mizon Snail Repair Eye Cream
* Missha Long Name Ampoule
* Missha FTE
* SkinFood Black Sugar Mask
* Innisfree Green Tea line (all of it!)
* HadoLabo Gokujyun Lotion
* OST C20
* Biore UV Aqua Rich Sunscreen
* More MBD masks
* A bunch of sleeping packs! Need recommendations for that one :) 




 Same here. I went crazy and ordered 30+ on ebay and I ran out of my MBD ones two days ago. I'm so sad. No idea when my order is going to be shipped! 




 So organized! I love it. I've heard so many good things about Sulwhasoo! I might add their Overnight Vitalizing Mask to my wishlist... 




 The LJH essence has been on my list for a while! I hear good things.  




 What's a brush egg? 




 I'm itching to get the Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum too. I actually ordered a cheap sample pack of the Green Tea line from Innisfree. So we'll see how it goes! Couldn't justify spending 20+ dollars on a full container. 




 Interesting, I've heard good things about the Acne.org BP. Thanks for the info! 




 Love your lip color. And I love that it's elf even more!  




 Is it possible that the Alpha Hydrox is too irritating when used daily? Like, what I mean is, if the Alpha Hydrox is what causes my breakouts, would using it less stop the breakouts? Because I don't breakout all over. I seem to only breakout on the sides of my cheeks, my neck, and now my forehead. 

Thanks for your response! 




 Gosh now I'm nervous. I'm seeing my doctor on Friday to get a prescription for the pill, and I'm hoping it improves my skin, but now I see it can commonly make it worse...but sometimes better!  




 What products are you using specifically?  




 That's such a good idea. I'm so annoyed with foundations that don't have a pump! 




 Heavy fragrances are commonly irritating. I read on here someone switching to a more organic brand like Seventh Generation helped with their acne. This is true for fabric softeners and fabric sheets as well. 

My other recommendation is changing toothpastes if you haven't already. Using a toothpaste without Sodium Lauryl Sulfate has helped many people with acne around their mouth/chin - I use Sensodyne personally.  




 I don't think it really matters when you use it. I typically cleanse during my shower.  




 Using the Clarisonic once a day is very harsh on your skin. I recommend using it only 2 or 3 times a week. Physical exfoliation alone will not get rid of your acne, if anything it could make it worse. Please check the sidebar for more information on starting a routine for acne-prone skin.

It's up to you whether you want to return it. Some people love it, but every day is too much.  




 I recommend posting in the daily routine thread. There's tons of information in the sidebar about starting a routine, depending on whether your skin is dry, oily, dehydrated, or acne prone. Take a look there (kokomocat linked you to it!). 

Once you've checked that out and you've got a basic routine going, you can ask questions in the Daily Routine Thread for more specifics. The people on there are very helpful! Good luck.  




 Your skin shouldn't feel tight after using it. You could try the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser. Do you moisturize in the morning or just at night? 

I would look for a cleanser that is hydrating rather than foaming. You might find good suggestions in the Dry skin routine in the sidebar.  




 I second asking a doctor or a dermatologist, especially if you are keeping the area moisturized.  




 1.) I had never heard of Cleanance K, but according to Paula's Choice it doesn't have the right percentage of Salicylic acid to be effective. You can read more about that [here](http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/avene/_/Cleanance-K-Cream-Gel). It also has fragrance in it which could irritate your skin. 

I would not recommend the scrub. I personally avoid any kind of physical scrub because it's too harsh. I would try adding the PC 1% BHA Gel. 

2.) You could try the Paula's Choice cleanser. It seems to have good reviews. I would go on cosDNA and review the ingredients. I personally use Cerave Foaming Cleanser which is quite cheap and effective. They also have a hydrating cleanser. 

3.) If you have discoloration, incorporating an AHA into your routine may be effective. I would look into what Paula's choice offers as far as AHAs go. A lot of people like the Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel.  




 You use it before the BP. You apply it, then wait 20 minutes to let it do it's thing, and then you apply the BP! So you do not need to wash it off.  




 That's strange that you break out from Cerave but not Cetaphil! I suspected you might be sensitive to fatty alcohols, in which case Nivea Creme is recommended, but I can't vouch for it being shiny or not. Another that's recommended is Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream, has very little in it that could be comedogenic. Worth looking into! 




 Hey! I was curious about this too so I did some searching on this subreddit and over on /r/AsianBeauty. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1lpvse/explain_toner_to_me/) toner is described nicely. 

Over in Asian Beauty they use pH balancing toners and hydrating toners. I think each toner has a different purpose rather than all toners have the same purpose, you know? 

[Etude House Wonder Pore](http://www.amazon.com/Etude-House-Wonder-Freshner-500ml/dp/B005TTSDYW) is quite popular, and its main function seems to be pH balancing and reducing the appearance of pores. 

I personally use Thayer's Witch Hazel with Rose Water. It smells amazing and makes my skin feel very fresh. I use it right after my Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser. [Here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_4f57150665.html) is the ingredient info on that - looks like it has pH balancers in it.

Typically American style toners are very drying because they have alcohol in them. Avoid any toner with alcohol in it, because this will worsen your dryness! I would head over to /r/AsianBeauty to search for a toner recommendation. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2i2opt/tonersmists_which_blow_you_away/) is a thread I found helpful, with lots of recommendations for toners for dry skin. 

Hope that helps!  




 Like MrPurr said below it could be because of how you are applying it. Instead of rubbing it on, try patting it on. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v34vYwYMCZE#t=50) is a nice video on how to do it if that's unclear. 

Do you feel a burning sensation, or does your skin just turn red? How long does it take for the redness to fade? 




 Interesting. But isn't it impossible to tell if it's PIH or PIE unless you do that pressure test? Where you push on the spot and if it goes away it's PIE?

 




 I was interested in what was in the body oil so I looked it up on cosDNA. [Here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_ffe3136079.html) is the link! Looks like it has a few ingredients that are irritating and comedogenic. That's quite a helpful website for looking at ingredients in the future. 




 I love my Vaseline intensive care moisturizer, the fragrance free kind. It works really well and is not irritating at all. It's also cheap and you can find it anywhere.  




 It's recommended to dilute the tea tree oil, general guideline is 10-15% tea tree oil diluted with a carrier oil. I mix my tea tree oil with mineral oil. It can cause burns and irritation if used directly on skin! Be careful.  




 If you want to do both the bha and aha at night, you need to apply one, wait 20-30 minutes, then apply the other and wait 20-30 minutes, then go about the rest of your routine. I generally apply my bha in the morning, and then my aha at night because it causes sensitivity to sunlight.  




 My first suggestion is to incorporate a better sunscreen. SPF 15 is not enough. I would get something with at least SPF 30.

For the moisturizing issue, I would sample a different moisturizer. I had issues with dry skin in certain areas but when using Cerave in the tub moisturizer my skin is very moisturized during the day. You could look into that or Cerave PM, which are both pretty similar except the PM has niacinamide in it, which can help with PIH.

Also, some people have success with the Hado Labo Gokujyun Lotion, which you use in addition to a moisturizer. It is also called the Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion which is sold at Walgreens!  




 Why are you using a face wash in addition to the salicylic wash? I'm wondering if this is too drying on your skin. Also, it is recommended to use SA in a lotion rather than a face wash, since the 30-45 seconds it is on your face is not enough time. I would recommend looking into a BHA lotion instead of the face wash. [Here](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Skin-Perfecting-Two-Percent-BHA-Lotion-Exfoliant/) is an example of what I mean.

Green tea does have anti-inflammatory properties, and there are actually a lot of skin care products with green tea in them that you apply topically. Could be worth looking into! There are a few asian products that come to mind, like Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum. I'm sure the green tea benefits you in other ways, like relaxing you! So it's not a bad habit :)

The sunscreen does moisturize, yes. If you don't feel like you need moisturizer in the morning you can skip it and only use sunscreen. 




 If he doesn't want to I can't see him using any kind of product no matter what I recommend. He has to want to do it...other than washing the bed sheets more often and replacing his pillow case every night I don't know what you could do.  




 I'm really disappointed because a product I am using is definitely causing me to break out. However, I am really not sure what product it is. Can someone help me figure this out? 

My routine is here:

**AM**

* Rinse face with water.
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel.
* Apply Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion (SA 2%). Wait 20 minutes.
* Apply Benton's Snail Bee High Content Essence.
* Apply a thin layer of Cerave in the tub.
* Apply Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30

**PM**

* OCM with sunflower oil and neem oil. Double cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser.
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel.
* Apply Alpha Hydrox. Wait 30 minutes.
* Apply Benton's Snail Bee High Content Essence.
* Sheet mask if I have the time.
* Apply a spot treatment to active pimples - either Burt's Bees Blemish stick, Clinique 10% BP gel, or 2.5% BP gel, or neem oil. Wait 10 minutes.
* Apply Cerave in the tub. Finish off with thin layer of Vaseline.

Okay, so I have used the following products without breakouts for a few months: all Cerave products, Alpha Hydrox, Neutrogena Lotion and sunscreen, sunflower oil and neem oil. I also don't react negatively to the BP spot treatments or my Burts Blemish stick. 

So that leaves the Thayer's Witch Hazel, which I recently incorporated into my routine, and the Benton Snail Bee (noooo). It's kind of funny because I should be more upset about my breakout but I'm kind of excited, because it's like a mystery I have to solve! 

So my plan is to reduce my routine to what I know does not cause breakouts (or at least, I'm 90% sure doesn't?). If that helps, then what should my plan be from there? Patch test the products again? Is it possible an old product caused me to breakout but didn't until now? Is it also possible none of my products are actually breaking me out and my boyfriend is right that I'm crazy and I just break out?

The thing is, I have weird bumps on my forehead, and my forehead is usually always freakin' clear. So it HAS to be a product, right? Also, could the vaseline be causing this? 

Also, one last thing, I created a DIY tea tree oil spot treatment, so 10% tea tree oil and the rest mineral oil. I know tea tree oil and mineral oil don't break me out, but my breakout coincided with the night I applied this to my spots. I just don't know...any help figuring this out is GREATLY appreciated! The breakouts are very very small bumps, some whiteheads, and honestly it's quite mild, but definitely a deviation from my normal skin. 

Thank you for the help, and sorry for the book!!

EDIT: I just remembered when I first started my new skincare routine I broke out on my neck, in a similar way I am breaking out on my forehead. At that point I was using Cerave foaming, Alpha Hydrox, and Cerave moisturizer. Could the Alpha Hydrox possibly be breaking me out too? 




 280 dollars?! Is there gold in it?  




 Awesome! Thank you so much for all the info! 




 How do you like the LJH tea tree essence? I was considering buying that because tea tree oil works so well with my skin. Has it helped with breakouts at all? 




 I've been hearing a lot lately that too many products in your routine is not a good thing, and that you can benefit from simplifying your routine. Is this a bunch of BS? My thought would be that if a routine with a lot of products isn't working, it's likely that one of those products is breaking you out, and so by simplifying it you just happen to get rid of the problem product. I've heard things like, you need to stop using so many products to give your face time to breathe and heal. This also sounds phony. Is there any evidence that less is more with skincare?

My routine is here:

**AM**

* Rinse face with water.
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel.
* Apply Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion (SA 2%). Wait 20 minutes.
* Apply Benton's Snail Bee High Content Essence.
* Apply a thin layer of Cerave in the tub.
* Apply Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30


**PM**

* OCM with sunflower oil and neem oil. Double cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser.
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel.
* Apply Alpha Hydrox. Wait 30 minutes.
* Apply Benton's Snail Bee High Content Essence.
* Sheet mask if I have the time.
* Apply a spot treatment to active pimples - either Burt's Bees Blemish stick, Clinique 10% BP gel, or 2.5% BP gel, or neem oil. Wait 10 minutes.
* Apply Cerave in the tub. Finish off with thin layer of Vaseline.


In addition I do a mint julep mask or aztec clay mask once a week.


I was considering adding in the OST C20 to my routine for Vitamin C. Where would this go in my routine? Also, I am going to be mixing tea tree oil and mineral oil to create a spot treatment in an amber dropper bottle. How do I go about figuring out percentages? Or should I ask in /r/DIYbeauty?

Thanks!
