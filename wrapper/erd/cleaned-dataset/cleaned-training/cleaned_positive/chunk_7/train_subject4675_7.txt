 Probably a lot younger than you, but, I *really* understand that feeling of losing everything all at once. PM me if you need someone to vent to and/or have pointless conversation with to distract yourself from doing something permanent.  




 Everyone else is getting burritos and I'm sitting in my car because I don't want to be happy.

I've found from my experience that eventually, we become so comfortable in our own misery that even though we are suffering, when given an opportunity to be happy, we become scared and don't know how to react. Then again, that's just how it felt for me. 




 It's like you go 3 steps forward only to get thrown 30 steps back, right? Let me tell you, these are things that happen in life- most people just don't have to deal with them all at once, maybe not even have to deal with some of them at all. I really am not trying to be generic here because I am going through a very similar experience (very different situation, same feeling) things pass. After a while it doesn't seem like the world is ending and you learn to cope. 




 Have you ever just stayed up doing something to the point of exhaustion to avoid that "in between" time of trying to fall asleep? 




 I'm about 9 years your junior, but, I feel that to a certain degree, I understand what you've gone/are going through. Everything bad seems to happen all at once, dog piling on top of each other. It sucks. I'm not gonna lie, it's really difficult to cope with everything. I'm not sure how to really address this, but just know if you need someone to talk to in an effort to keep yourself from doing something *permanent* as a solution to a somewhat *temporary* problem, PM me. 




 I don't really know how to describe it. It's like, I won't want to close my laptop because I know it's keeping me up, but, at the same time, the period of time spent in the quiet darkness before falling asleep is too bearable to deal with because of my thoughts. Anyone else?
