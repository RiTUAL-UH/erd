 You forgot it in people- broken social scene

In the aeorplane over the sea- neutral milk hotel

Illmatic- nas

Music from big pink- the band

Sgt. Peppers lonely hearts club band- the Beatles 




 fair enough, but i think the consequences of failing this course arguably outweigh the annoyance of taking and additional half credit, at least in my situation, being an english student. do you need a science credit for a commerce degree? 




 yeah, i got 30/60. our marks were also 6 points higher than they would have been, because she boosted them. i might end up dropping psych, im too worried i might fail 




 try redreader beta, not super popular, but awesome nonetheless  




 i think you still get the breadth requirement. do you know when the marks will be available? I'm in the same credit/no credit situation.  




 im pretty sure i bombed it, i spent way too much time reviewing lecture notes, instead of studying the texbtook. might drop the course and try to get into a big idea course next year to fulfill the science credit for my degree 




 class is taught by prof luby, what do I need to know for the midterm? her outline was incredibly vague 




 is their any way to access the marking scheme short of having an awkward conversation with a ta?
