 I'm on Zoloft - or the British equivalent sertraline - and I think it's helping. I need to start therapy but I think it is helping. I'm much less self-destructive now :)

Be prepared for the initial side effects though (as with all antidepressants) and go back to your doctor if you think it's not for you. 

Good luck!! I wish you the best!
