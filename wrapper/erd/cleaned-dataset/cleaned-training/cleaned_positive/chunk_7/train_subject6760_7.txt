 Wow! 




 Maybe 70%. 




 I thought it was better than all of WWE, with the Miz and Ambrose the exceptions. 




 Let's see. I was impressed by Jason Jordan's move set. Perfect for the brand of champions that WWE Creative usually goes for. 




 I get what you mean by you feeling that NXT superstars feel like your "children." I really want Bo Dallas to do well, just like most preceding him (The Shield and The Wyatts). 




 Not sure about Enzo  Cass. 




 Agree that Tyson Kidd is better as a heel. But I doubt if he'll be effective in the main roster. 




 About the Ascension vs. Luke Harper/Eric Rowan feud - that's what the guys at Ring Rust Radio are predicting too. 




 I think it's not just the timing of the move - they need to be given good roles/storylines. 




 I've been really impressed with Sami Zayn and Tyler Breeze (more than Adrian Neville). Plus, I love the Vaudevillians gimmick. All of them, plus The Ascension, should be on the main roster, right? Plus, I watched Jason Jordan in this week's NXT episode and even be looked good enough to get into the main roster. What do you all think? 




 Oh, thank you for the clarification!
