 Well done OP. They're healing good! Keep going. Speaking for most people here; we're proud of you, 1 year is amazing!   




 Happy birthday ðŸŽ‚  




 I've never really liked being a mage, but that does sound tempting :p 




 *disappears at the thought of outdoors* 




 God fucking damn it, Jesus!  




 Seconding this. 




 I've only played through as 1H/Shield, and two handed. I've been meaning to play through as an archer for a while now. It seems like it would be pretty fun!  









 Congrats  Keep going! ^-^

 Congrats on the 127 days, that's awesome OP :3
