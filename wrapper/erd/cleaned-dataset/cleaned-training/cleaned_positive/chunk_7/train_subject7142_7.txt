 Do you have a good relationship with your mother ( the question stands about both of your parents actually ) ?  Is there any open-minded person you trust and could talk to ?
I'm asking in hopes to help you find a way to tell your mom.

Anyways,don't be embarassed. I know it's easy to say but there's nothing to be embarassed about. You are who you are,and it's a great thing. :) 




 Recently I've came out to some of my closest friends about being transgender ( FTM).

So.. the first friend,had a lovely reaction and said he's supportive. I'm very thankful for this yet he still uses female pronoms to refer to me and I would like to ask him to use the right ones. I don't really know how to do that and I feel a bit guilty to ask him since I don't pass very well. I know it's stupid :/

The second friend *is* the problem. Refers to me as male (...sometimes) but says and does things that make me very uncomfortable,such as " do you really want a dick ?" and laughs,outed me to his boyfriend as well ( who was nice about it,but still,I wish I could have told him myself when ready). Also,I was/am in love with a guy who rejected me,and all he had to say was " this guy rejected you because he must be gay". He said it multiple times,even if I told him how painful it was for me to hear that. He jokingly said I could try with that guy again when I have a dick,aswell.

Because of this one friend,I'm afraid to come out to the rest of the people around me. I can get that it's hard to process for them,but I've always been willing to help them understand. Yet this guy is being a douche and doesn't get it,I've called him out on his bullshit multiple times,no changes.
What should I do ?  

 




 January - April :  
The bad : 
- Dropped out from college because the schedule was too fucked up for me to work and well... I need to support myself.
- Huge fight with one of my former close friends,now we're enemies.
- Started cutting.
- Recovered then relapsed into anorexia.
The good : 
- Started to talk with the boy I've been in love of for years in secret.
- Figured I was a transboy,finally came in terms with it and stopped being in denial.
- Came out to my parents,both about my gender and my sexual orientation.
 
May - July 
Positive : 
- This boy I liked so much for years told me he likes me back. 
- Happy.
- Not hating my body so much anymore and found some beauty in myself. 
- No more self-destructive urges.
- Lowest weight in ages. ( not sure if it's really postive,but to me it is.) 

Negative : 
- Money issues,debts,can't find a job.
- Way too violent,way too jealous of my friends.
- Fell in love with my eating disorder,started telling myself it's thanks to it that I'm finally "happy". 

The end of July to now : 
- The boy told me he didn't want to be with me after leading me on for months.
- Basically hit rock bottom : back to cutting,back to self-hate,gone crazy.
- Lonely as fuck,spending all day in bed,wandering the streets at night completely high.
- Falling out with all my friends due to me isolating myself.
- Started doing drugs.

Still some positive things :

- Going to a new school in a field I really like. Don't want to go but I'm going to force myself to.
- Met a great supportive online friend.
- Went to a therapist. It didn't change shit but it was still a big step for me to see someone.
- Planning to transition even if I'm not sure I'll ever have the money and strenght to do this all alone.

So yeah basically this is it !

 




 Man,I know how this feels,this impression of having lived so many lives. 
I've done the same things you did and I didn't stop,I kept acting,now I'm 22 and I feel like I've lost my sanity in the process. The idea of "whatever I can be anything" replaced my true personality. Deception,rejection ? New persona. And I truly believe they *are* who I am,now.

I think you should keep on drawing. This is something the real you wanted to do,it seems. It's absolutely understandable that you want your parents to love you but I don't think they will love you any less if you pursue your dream,sure it might take time for them to understand but at the end it can be worth it. 
Also,do you have someone in your family you're close to you could talk to about the way you feel,who wouldn't brush it off and then could help you tell the truth to your parents ?
