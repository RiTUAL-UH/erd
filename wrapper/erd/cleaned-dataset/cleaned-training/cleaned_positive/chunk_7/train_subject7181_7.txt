 Hmm... It is difficult to be rational with someones life... reminds me of ethics class (when is a person too old to get the expensive meds etc.)...

He is better now than when we met from a rational point I guess.   

He used to hurt himself twice a day, every morning and every evening. He now only does it when something upsets him, maybe two times a week (and he never remembers it)  
He was about to drop out of High School when we met and is now studying at university (with two majors, though I am scared that it is too much and he'll fail one)
He has a job, well he has a bunch of jobs, but this one has a future and is in the field he wants to work in at an international company. We work together there (got hired as a team of 3 with a friend). But he could do what I do, doesn't necessarily need me and our boss knows that I'll quit once I finish medschool.  
He has two close friends who know about his mental health and the situation with me, even the sexual difficulties (this might be the most important thing)

So I guess he is better. But he says that it only can get worse and "why not kill myself while things are still ok?"

On the negative end he now thinks that he'll never get "real sex" or a girlfriend who is "interested in him". Because I need time to study (means to him that I think that school is more important than him) and yeah the sex part...   
He does not seem to grasp the idea of ever meeting someone else... at least he tried with his classmates but it seems that most of them have a boyfriend, so he stopped trying...

Cost is only on my side. That should not come into the equation... but you are right I should find out if I am still of any use for him. In a perfect world I'd find a nice very sexually active girlfriend for him and then he'd slowly forget about me...
