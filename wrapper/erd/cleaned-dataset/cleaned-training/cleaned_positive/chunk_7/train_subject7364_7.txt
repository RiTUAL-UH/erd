 I hate to tell you this but you really look stupid to everyone reading this. You obviously have no valid experience with the subject matter at hand from which to draw any realistic conclusions.

Everyone here knows that driving while intoxicated is a crime, and they know why, and that it's punished harshly for a good reason.

What you fail to realize is that this is a cash grabbing stunt that every law enforcement office in the country just can't wait to get their hands on.

In that sense, you are personally insulting everyone who views this thread that understands the ramifications of your type of ignorance: that you'd vote for people who favor unjust laws of this nature.

It's just what's happening. Try not to take it too personally. Your feathers are showing. Instead, I might suggest, if you are in fact here because you don't know what you are talking about and you are not just trolling for a fight, that you address the concerns others raised in direct opposition to your first comment in this thread rather than picking and choosing those arguments that you feel you found a flaw with. Your own argument's basis in reality is flawed in this regard, and it's blatantly obvious because you simply refuse to address the real concerns behind this entire issue and instead choose to pursue some personal agenda.

Perhaps you are a victim of an intoxicated driver/person or know someone who was, but I can tell one thing is for certain: you've never had an unjust DWI or DUI (about half get dismissed in Travis County here in Texas alone). I can tell not because you are so righteous (your petty arguments are very laughable and easily deconstructed by even the most primitive of debate tactics), it is because your lack experience with "the system" *as a whole* really shows. 




 The problem with googling how to do that is you are just getting a list of instructions.

Actually thinking up this sort of idea and implementing it by reading software manuals and knowing what you are looking at in terms of communications protocols is an entirely different thing.

If you really mean what you said, I would offer you a little advice: read one manual page a day. In just one year you'll know more, or at least have been exposed to more than 90% of "sysadmins" out there. 




 Install Linux on your wireless router and pipe the raw output of tcpdump on the various vlans/interfaces through ssh back into instances of etherape displaying the activity using remote X authority.

Bonus: understand all that shit and you might land a job doing it.

 So then it's more like playing golf..

"Don't move.... don't move.... WHACK!!!"

No. I still don't get it do I? 




 Imagine playing cricket with a two ton ball of horns and hooves flying at you with the force of a cement truck, and trying to stop it with with a firecracker and a fishing weight. 




 "God, I hate this job" I muttered to myself.

Handing out bags of blood and skeletal remains all day can take a toll on a soul.

"Stay in school" said the voice in my head.

Or was it the bright-eyed customer with wings speaking to me through the cross hung around my neck?

I may never know, but I can tell you one thing: life in the ghetto is a drag. All you need is one puff to know that. A real shame, this chance we waste. 




 Bust out the popcorn hahaha.... 




 Okay, who's brother owns the drug testing company this time? 




 Would definitely be high on my "Shit To Do" list as governor of this state about now. 




 No shit. That thing shows up in Port A it's toast. There will be a thousand people out there trying to eat it. 




 Thanks for the heads up.

By the way, I just saved $100 on Sharknado insurance. Disclaimer: I live inland for a reason. 




 It would make more sense for the Mexican government to get their own shit together.

What do I know though? I have only grown up watching the US thoroughly bungle op after op for decades. Maybe they are right on this one. What could go wrong? 




 You work in IT long enough this is bound to happen. I've trained one myself, but knew it was coming. I designed and built the system, got this guy on and trained him to support it at a much lower rate, and I moved on to building another system.

This is just the way things are.

But there are new systems being built every day, and most companies in the US just can't assume an H1B workforce right off the bat. Someone local has to design them, put them together, act as vendor liaison, make the hiring recommendations, and all that fun stuff. It'll work out.

Right? 




 ok ok i did it. anyone got a problem with... odessa better speak up.


hah... 




 Venting is good. It lets people know that they are not the only ones who feel this way.


Speaking of which, I took a GIS course at Del Mar College and spent all my time dumping any data I could find for the Nueces county area into ARCView. I had a gigantic dataset to work with at the end of the semester with hundreds of layers and options.

What I found out was that you do not want to live in Corpus long, and you really don't want to have kids there. The reasons are not just economic or social, but environmental. The place is straight up toxic and all told certain parts of the city should be superfund sites.

It's been over 10 years since I did this research. I was inspired by someone who taught school in Corpus that found less that 200 PPM life in the Nueces river watershed after uranium tailings started getting dumped into the river system. He said each drop of water from the river should be teeming with life when in fact it was barren, and the microscopic organisms he studied were mutated and unrecognizable.

Granted that's a little hearsay for you, but it's what I was told by someone I trust very much.

I was pretty much blacklisted from the school after putting together "the map". I just wanted to find out what neighborhoods were best, but I wound up learning that Corpus has one of the highest birth defect rates in the country, among a ton of other unsettling things.

[Of course, Nueces county having 84% more birth defects than any other in Texas could all be chalked up to "chance".](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:utsXQj_hfLYJ:www.caller.com/news/2008/jan/25/birth-defects-84-percent-higher-nueces-co")

I would get the fuck out of there if I were you. There is a reason the population of that city has not undergone a significant increase in decades. You can't save that city from those refineries and well meaning efforts like yours are probably better spent elsewhere in a place where your ideology has a head start. Living there in willful ignorance is what people are doing. 

I can see you wanting to pretty the place up, but you are polishing a turd in doing so. Of course Corpus has great potential. What coastal city does not? The problem is that the place is just a dump and the majority of voters there are literally too stupid to do anything about it. There is really no way to clean that place up and that is why thousands and thousands of high school and college graduates and dropouts alike have just *left*. 




 It occurred to me that this kind of thing would shake up this market in some sense.

As someone who has worked in the field for years, I'd have to argue about maintaining copper (at least coax) vs. running fiber costs.

The copper is already there. We are looking at easements, the little battery boxes here and there, the hubs, and headends. With fiber the logistics of running new line all over town are practically insurmountable without the overt support and assistance of often multiple municipalities for a given run.

Fiber requires expensive equipment to be placed every so often, equipment that needs space.. zoning. Power, backup, high availability, etc. are all huge factors that coax systems just don't really have to deal with at a comparable cost for the sheer fact that the infrastructure for such services is already allotted and often oversubscribed in and of themselves.

Moreover, the equipment that delivers this fiber service from the curb to the home is basically your run of the mill Alcatel-Lucent fiber to copper switch. Multi-gig links across single mode fiber multiplexing the dozens of 10/100/1000 ethernet links to people's homes all terminating into carefully calculated port density located inside of water tight and up-to-date regulation adhering boxes every few hundred feet.

Unless of course they are delivering fiber to the curb, which they are most often not. FIOS is a bit of a different story, as is my understanding. Verizon often runs fiber straight into a box on the side of a house, peeling off a wavelength from the fiber trunks following power lines.

Having painted this picture, the zoning and logistics of getting this MUX and media conversion in place is really what the problem is all about for companies like ATT. In more than a few markets, particularly on the west coast, this has been a complete disaster for them. U-Verse, Lightspeed.. whatever you want to call it all came from projects similar to Google's later fiber initiative. The difference is that ATT really suffered when breaking this over-building ground while their successors in the industry were able to benefit from ATT's blundering lessons, such as "don't try this in California's mega-metropolitan areas without balls of steel and abyssal pockets.

Now here we site, more along the lines of your second paragraph. Doing this on a scale that would actually effect change in people's ability to communicate would seriously fuck the status quo, no matter how you spin it.

Thanks for the financial insight. As a grunt and engineer I see it from one perspective and have intentionally ignored the numbers aspect, which is probably where my question really came from. 




 Both. 




 I wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that building out fiber to everyone's curb is prohibitively expensive, and the act of doing so would trigger cable companies to "flip the switch" on DOCSIS3.  




 If this information is true about her being denied medication, and depending on the nasty stuff they had her on, it's easy to believe that she could have gone into some kind of withdrawal-related shock.

I bet she had a seizure after 48 hours of no SSRIs and died from complications related to her not having her blood pressure medication.

It's going to be something convoluted like that. I say that - I doubt the official story will tell us anything too incriminating about the PD, but if there is any merit to the story about her not having access to these particular types of medication you can bet she suffered horribly for it, especially if she were on high-doses.

Sure, it's all speculation at this point, but I've seen people in jail go through withdrawals from these types of meds, and it's not pretty. Here in Austin, one of the questions you are asked is if you are on benzodiazepenes. Another is how often you drink. If you tell them you eat 100 MG of Xanax a day and/or a bottle of Wild Turkey with your dinner, they are going to have to accommodate you or you will drop dead in a couple days if that. 




 He is just doing what he got voted into office to do. This is what republicans want, and they are getting it. Good for them. I wish every other political party out there was as true to their word as this guy.  




 give her a gigantic hug

Thanks for this. I used to hear this all the time at places like the grocery store, the beach, parties, and pretty much wherever I ran into people who she taught. It was great to read this in this context. Made me feel like she was still teaching, still part of that community.

Mom is still here but not for long. I will give her a hug from Reddit.

I never thought I'd be saying those words. Look at the big, hard man right now... 




 Single mom. Feel better now?

You probably shouldn't talk about my father.

One does not necessarily have to **pay** for someone else's lunch for them to be able to eat, but it helps

There's a proverb out there about teaching and fish. I'll let you figure it out. 




 My mother was a teacher. She spent her paychecks and entire teaching career helping students in need by making sure they had a ride to school, tooth brushes, deodorant, **lunch**, school supplies... basic things that some parents simply did not provide. She would even rescue animals, particularly strays she found around the campus, take them home, doctor them up, and find homes for them.

And she got ran out of a school district for it.

Let me tell you something about this. I watched her suffer for the lack of empathy that everyone else had for children, animals, and life in general. I watched how that school district sucked the life out of her and ostracized her for having a heart. Her kids did so much better on tests and in life in general that it made the other teachers look bad. It made the establishment look bad. The low bar held by the school district was being raised by her behavior, and few of the other teachers could keep up. She showed kids more than how to use a comma. She showed them love - especially the kids who had none at home.

I am filled with rage for what happened to her. I have no pity whatsoever for school administrators who get sacked for corruption and incompetence, and if it weren't for the sweet-natured woman who raised me I too would have grown up absolutely bitter about it in a less than civilized way. I take a very critical eye to my child's education, and you better believe I will not tolerate anything less than the things my mother brought to class for her kids.

Raise the bar. If we don't, another country will. Other countries **are**. We will have no way of competing on a globally growing scale in just another generation or so without the kind of dedication and charisma brought to the table by the most special and influential of people in our children's lives.

I don't care what anyone says. When you see her mailbox around Christmas explode with cards from kids she taught 10 years prior, you see what I mean when I say education lost one hell of an icon when she was run out of town years ago.

My mother would have paid for this child's lunch, and she would have gotten to the bottom of why they were short their lunch money.

Edit: Commas. 




 I'll never visit New Braunfels or San Antonio's parks again because of the crowds, but seeing this in Corpus will have me go out of my way to get some RR at the water park with the family - and I can get out and catch me some reds.

This is a great idea. It will bring money into the Corpus economy, provide a few jobs, and put some of those roads to use. I hope it attracts enough business to stay afloat. 

---

The only problem is that this waterpark is on the Island. That's quite a drive, and during spring break season that causeway is going to be gridlocked for a solid month. Traffic on that little old highway 361 is already pretty bad most of the season, with the speed limit never going above 60 and the road only being two lanes (and cops everywhere..).

So here we go with the traffic jams. Corpus can't win for losing. 




 Thanks for the tip!  




 Are you hiring bulldozer drivers?

My career has been focused on UNIX systems and Cisco network engineering. Big firewalls, giant NAC implementations, customized authentication mechanisms and turnkey VPN solutions, among a bunch of other non-AD and Exchange/IIS administration stuff.

I am not a Windows guy. Never have been, and that's what really bums me out about Corpus. Unless I can find a job doing simple Cisco network engineering, or working for an ISP, I'll be lucky to even land a seat at CSC for some Hazmat training this August. 




 Generally speaking about %15 but no less than $2 on a plate of food.

That's my policy. I don't use a calculator for this.. round it up. Spend your time enjoying the place, not squabbling over pennies. I've actually had to encourage people to do this before, so there you go. 




 I second this if only for the fact that even if you lived exactly half-way between Katy and Austin, her commute would still take much longer because highway 71 coming into Austin at all hours of the day is TERRIBLE. Highway 290 has 50 traffic lights between Brenham and any given spot in town, and they are only putting up more every day.

Have you considered road construction between here and there? Probably wouldn't hurt to check out what's coming up. It could really be a deal breaker.

You got the good end of this stick, and believe me, the other end doesn't smell good.

This all sounds good on paper to you now, but two months of this commute and you'll be at each other's throats. Besides, for what you'd save in gas by working/living locally you'd have enough to rent a decent place for each of you.

Putting miles like that, especially during the summer, on your vehicles is really going to take it's toll in a few months time.

I could literally sit here all night and think of reasons why this is not the best of ideas. Noble, I'll give you that, but realistic is not a word I'd use to describe this scenario.

If you both have jobs *now* you have a better chance of getting a job in either city. At the risk of sounding presumptuous (I'm given little to work with), I'd have to say the way I would handle this situation is to get a place outside of Katy for the time being, get her set up in a temporary place in Austin, and have her *immediately* start looking for work in Houston.

Either way she's gonna hate Texas traffic with a passion soon enough. 

I mean honestly the sick part of me kind of laughs at the thought.. it just doesn't make sense man. That's coming from a cynic who has suffered 25 years of commuting to and from all over Texas; from the bitter country boy who watched traffic, overpopulation and the resulting sprawl obliterate the countryside over the last 45. If you are looking to get reasons to avoid traffic from someone and tips on how to do so, that I can provide, but I have a hard time justifying anything that doesn't involve minimizing time on the road.

The humanitarian in me is what made me offer these words in good faith. 




 "If only they could"

My heart weeps, let me tell you.

Put an axe in it. 




 Daybreak's beams cast their grip up and over the Organ Mountains, combing the fine sands of the plains below. Red irises and slit pupils glint dutifully as the ancient white sands of a place once called "New Mexico" became illuminated by an alien spectrum of UV light that only a planet with very little atmosphere could entertain. 

As *the collective* proceeds, cyanotic scales glimmered more and more sharply as familiarly proportioned yet immense figures arise in droves from the dizzying depths of an obsidian staircase upward into the most prophetically inhospitable climate ever suffered by any form of self-consciousness born of this now barren planet.

And to *the collective* is offered an intensifying electric-blue glow and a sizzling expanse of a horizon interrupted only by heat dissipating from the occasional and fleeting mirage. The blindingly raw spectrum of first light that once primitively triggered a series of biological reactions has been usurped with a  circadian rhythm autonomously independent of external stimuli and redesigned by the forces of nature to bend to the will of these sole surviving witnesses of time, *the collective*.

A first set of eyelids shutter out the sterilizing radiation and unrelenting abrasiveness of finely ground glass. A glass so pervasive and mercilessly cast by unimpeded winds that long ago scoured was the once living terrain of color, and now only the most persistent of jagged rock spires stand in mere skeletal ruins of what were once the most massive geological features on the face of this rock we made our home. The surface of a world once covered in mountains as high as oceans deep now floats through space as a cemetery where no epitaph could survive the elemental barrage, where no dates could represent time itself in any meaningful way, where the concept of life and death lost polarization long before the mountains dissolved and seas boiled away.

The wind picks up as an isobar passes over the region, and the very ground begins to vibrate as the chanting masses synchronize the indescribably minute details of their planetary domain with their self-conceived and self-achieved biological limit of intelligence, a form of sentient life that was once only fanciful belief of even the greatest minds our own grandchildren will not even have heard of in their time.

As quickly as the sand was stirred by the shuffling of reverent footsteps the ritual is complete. *The collective* files back through the immense labyrinth of volcanic corridors and caverns that have for eons sculpted and to perfection the last living vessels of human DNA the Earth will ever see. The labyrinth created by the very beings spawned from it's protective depths, once a raging inferno tempered ultimately to provide a utopian existence for a civilization who manifested the ability to not only bring forth from fire and brimstone the soft and subtle cravings of the flesh, but to eliminate the effects that only a craving animal can bring to it's own doorstep.

What little is still known of their lineage is only a minor mystery. While the bones and buildings and accomplishments of ancient times have long since been returned to elementary form, they are no longer needed by a race of beings capable of willfully modifying their own genetic expression to thrive under conditions which we mere prototypes could not have even imagined a hand in bringing upon ourselves.

Their knowledge is the absolute truth about the meaning of knowledge itself: Life will find a way, and without life there is no way to be found.
 




 You couldn't get me on 71 towards dripping springs around dinner time if the meal were free. 




 Okay. $2 a foot. Deal?

I'm kidding. Let me ask about it and I'll get back with you. Would it be possible to see some pictures of the place? 




 That's the total estimate based on what you've said, assuming we aren't spending it all on paints and what not. Would like to take a look to see how fair that is and go from there. 




 $1.00 per foot, primed and painted, he said.

 




 This is the double standard by which our government operates, and with it being in the face of everyone who watches television/has a phone/uses the internet in general, maybe it will finally get some attention. 




 Unfortunately might makes right in this country. The process you are speaking of is the perversion of our government that has been going on for decades if not centuries to at least some extent.

It's just the way things get done around here and as our working generation has been taught no amount of voting is going to change things.  




 I brought this up with my carpenter and am awaiting a response. We just finished remodeling the interior of a house and our customer is thoroughly impressed with especially the interior. His baseboards and molding are flawlessly cut and painted.

How many rooms? 




 I slept on this and took down the original response in an effort to clarify my stance, our abilities, and intentions. Thank you for your time.

I'd highly recommend that anyone looking to use a service like this pay absolutely little to nothing until the work is substantially complete to your satisfaction or use a escrow or something.

* Payment comes after the job is complete or as work progresses satisfactorily, depending on the size and nature of the job. 
* We are not really looking for large jobs unless it is something we are 110% sure we can complete.

Classic case with a lot of small "contractors" is they take the money, have no clue what they are doing, bankrupt, and the customers are left with nothing. 

* I have been victimized by such "small contractors" and would not wish that on anyone.
* We would require some money for initial materials depending on the job. This is only fair.
* Then again, this is totally dependent on the nature and size of the job.
* We are far from clueless. Meet the crew:

**The Carpenter**

Our *real* [Journeyman Carpenter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentry#Apprenticeships_and_Journeymen_carpenters) has been swinging a hammer his entire life. He is stout and limber and can use up a stack of plywood faster than anyone I've seen. He is also excellent with automobiles and generally speaking is a wizard with woodwork.


**The Mechanic**

Our mechanic has been working on vehicles for 40 years, the veritable and venerable equivalent of mastery. Ask him a question about a vehicle... He has also performed his share of carpentry and electrical wiring in homes and buildings. I have been pushing him to become [ASE Certified](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Service_Excellence), which he could do in a heartbeat if I could talk him into taking [the tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Service_Excellence#Tests).


**The Painter**

Our *real* [Master Painter/Craftsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_craftsman) has been doing paint for 20 years and can repair, pick up, and carry damn near anything across the site.


**The Help**

A couple of deck swabbers that clean like the wind. Smart people and all around great to work with and easy to talk to.


**Myself**

I guess I'm the boss, but I don't look at it that way. I grew up in oil fields and ranches around Texas and New Mexico. I've performed my share of mechanics, carpentry, electronics repair, and am a former professional residential and commercial cabling technician, field supervisor, and quality control manager. I also have ten years of progressively difficult, end-to-end IT business systems architecture and information security engineering. I am also 100% self taught in all of these disciplines.

My full resume is 10 pages long and will hand it over to other honest, hard working people whom I feel trustworthy.


There's a lot of good ones, but a lot of bad too. I hate to call you out but there are way to many shitty one guy, day laborers, and a truck deals low balling the hell out of everything, doing an awful job, and giving everyone who does construction a bad name.

* We are the good guys, but you don't have to take our word for it.
* Don't feel bad about mentioning these things. It's prudent and no offense is taken.
* We are far from clueless and don't necessarily "lowball". 
* Our work is worth good money, and we are doing the bidding on our dinner tables. 
* We just need work like everyone else, and are very proud of how we do it.

Because I can only post so much here meeting in person is something I like to do. I've shaken the hands of over 10,000 satisfied customers over the years, and plan on shaking many more.

Thanks for the opportunity to organize my thoughts.

As a side note, we've recently had many tools stolen from a job site, and are having to work even harder to get them back. Generally speaking we can rent what we lost for a day or four where necessary. I mention this as a factor in the estimate given that it may take us longer to complete certain aspects of a job without tools, which brings down the rates, whereas should we have/obtain said equipment then our efficiency improves, thus increasing our rate. It's not necessarily an issue I would ask a customer to consider in conversation, but I'm throwing it out there initially just to air the room.

Does this address some of your concerns? I realize words are worthless without the actions to back them up, but without the opportunity to perform there is no point in even writing this down. **We have references**. 




 About $250 for the labor assuming it's an automatic. Two of us will jump on it so we can knock it out in one day, unless we have to go pull one.

Do you need us to obtain a transmission and any other parts?
 




 No.

We are building the funds, clientele, and crew to earn a small business loan if this takes off.

Thank you for pointing this out, and I apologize for not mentioning it. We do good work and are trying to keep things simple for the time being in order to avoid any sort of conflict whatsoever. Our ideal customer needs smaller jobs done that would not require them to spend very much to complete on their own, but need some honest help. A couple days work at a time is ideal. 




 this internet was a wilderness Before and Ever After White Nights like you

**Gigabit Sewage**

The structure is familiar to other work on this page.

The end references the beginning in a way that is not only relevant to subject matter, but relevant to the choice wording. It's like a double entendre, but not.

 Perhaps exploring not the light itself but where the light is cast and observed would be a more detailed exposure of this feeling.

Something like that, but a little more happy in your case, haha.

 Not to nitpick, but punctuation (capitalization) assists the reader with pauses.
