 I'm going to remember that, I mean everyone recites the whole 'it's medicine hakuna matata' monologue but for a while I felt like I wasn't myself because they were making me into a different person, happy or not. I guess it.doesn't affect my personality, just my mood. It's an assist but not life support.  




 I wouldn't make this judgement for others, but even though I'm not ashamed of being medicated, I still strongly want to avoid becoming dependent or relying on them to feel good. Everything that happened today brought that fear more into light, and although I have an illness I guess I just wish I could be okay on my own.
