 I read somewhere that he's a marathon runner.  




 My mom wrapped me in a yellow blanket when I was a baby and I looked like a melon. 




 Get yourself to a hospital.  




 You have the coolest dorm poster ever. You'll instantly know who your friends are.  




 That is a mighty large creature you got there. 




 He's the new shumanitutonka ob wachi! 




 You have a point, but I think the way it was presented showed that he knew what was going to happen.  









 That would be awesome, but if the past is a lesson, I'm not counting on it :/ 




 Does anyone know where to find the music from the latest episode?  




 I tearbended so hard. The feels were too much for me... 




 I completely understand that feeling. 




 Imma girl... 




 Went to BestBuy the other day, just to look around really. I went to the entertainment center and of course, what would be playing on one of the 50" screens, but a certain unnamed movie. Only one thing could be done...I turned off the TV and left.  




 It makes me sad that yet another thing is tainted with his name.  




 certainly do. 




 I'm in the suburbs too. Northwest of the city. Ever heard of Ambler? 




 Yea! Same here! 




 Pennsylvania here 




 Why do I feel like he's gonna be the new Zuko? 




 I never noticed Lin unlocking the handcuffs! Wow..that's cool. Hmm, I'd to say the whole secret tunnel thing under Sato's mansion. I couldn't help but love the connection to the TLA secret tunnel. In the same seen, when Mako and Bolin tie up the guard, I thought it was great how Bolin just nonchalantly moved his leg to earthbend to make the guard stumble over.  




 wait..are those tornados? damn!
