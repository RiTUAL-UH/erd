 Wow, well that'sâ€¦ incredibly vague. I have a feeling it will be a full two weeks between betas 2 and 3, the latter of which will bring the real Apple Music. 




 Yes but it's honestly not that annoying to me, for whatever reason. I really hope iOS 9 beta 3 improves upon issues in the second beta in addition to improving overall stability  battery life. At first (in beta 1) I hated the font change, but now I've learned to love it.

New OS improvements like those found in iOS 9 are a large part of the reason why I love sticking around in the leisurely and confident Apple ecosystem, just to see what Apple does (Low Power Mode has been amazing, for example).

 Great description. I recently decided that if one were to paraphrase the "high experience" in one word it would be "nostalgia." Just that feeling of longing warmth and comfort. Nostalgia. 














 Thank you!
