 Hey guys! I had said I was going to do one of these but I have yet to even touch my xbox sice school started but this weekend I an free so tonight (Saturday) at 6:30 I will play ODST woth anyone who wants to!

PPE:Sorry for any pelling errors! Quickly tuped on my phone:)

**EDIT**: Okay now that I am on my laptop, Tonight at 6:30 PM Central Time, I (GT: Troop4921) will be hosting an ODST game night! It will mostly include Firefight but there will probably be a little bit of campaign for those in need of achievements! See you all on the battlefield! 




 Spartans never die. They just go missing in action.
Remember the fallen.  




 It looks like the monsters from Scooby Doo Movie! Or [this](http://www.zetaminor.com/images/dvd_review_images/scooby_doo/scooby_monster.jpg) for those who don't have kids or siblings 




 I turned off AWOP cause I had more problems running it solo then I do PN so I think there is a misfunction between the two but I can't place it.
 




 I like looking for 100% lists before completing the DLC's I can't return to. I would say all of Dean's Stashes, All unique suits/weapons, One of each aid item, and maybe all dialogue trees exhausted?
 




 What's the material? 




 YCS/186 Unique Gauss Rifle 




 I guess but I use her and everytime I go to check for inventory, I close to shit myself. Scary voicing lemme tell you. 




 Match ammo, yes. 




 I started my playthrough with energy weapons and by the time I was level 50 I only used the Anti-Material:/ but I still use YCS a bit
 




 And what is awesome is Rushing Water isn't addictive at all so when I knock them back one after another, it doesn't kill me!:D 




 I set the requirements high so it would be harder to get. Is 6 the normal level? Cause if so then I should change it to around 8. I thought of it in the point of, your so good at it, Casino's almost make a show out of you coming and everyone wants to play against you so Casino's net a lot when you come around. IDK just an idea?
 




 Rushing Water. Gets rid of that useless Jet and turns my tasteless water into a sweet shot! Love knocking back one then killing Yao Guais with my bare hands!:D 




 Perk: Luck of the Draw

Description: You sure do know how to hold 'em and fold 'em and for that skill, Casinos never kick you out! You make two times the normal amount of money and have a higher chance of getting a perfect hand in Blackjack!

Req.: Luck 6, Barter 50, Speech 50

 Don't feel bad. A LOT of people don't know about this right off the bat and sometimes just dawn upon it with 50-300+ hours in game. I figured out towards the end of FO3 on my xbox then kinda just guessed when I got New Vegas on PC. 




 Marcus and Neil both:(  I really liked Fawkes in FO3 and would have loved for a legitimate Mutant follower. 









 Project Nevada! So much fun! Add's alot of the cool fun weapons from FO3 back in game!:) 




 There is a console command that you can use. Just click the item in the ~ screen and type in ~setownership 1 . The item selected becomes yours!:D 




 Just a good ol' laser rifle for FO3 but with FNV it would be AER14 or Tri-Beam 




 You new here? And yes, like u/Refleq said, It is the sheriff and his wife and they were killed by the criminals that took Primm over. 




 *count as bullshit until confirmed* hahaha 









 Zion Academy for the Physically Talented. 




 I liked the bobbleheads. There was just so many of them and, imho, they were harder to find. 




 I just moved so my xbox isn't plugged in but I totally would 




 So, when did you graduate from Killjoke University?
 




 If your stuck there for more than, say 10 seconds, delete the DLC and reinstall. Otherwise its ~enableplayercontrols 




 [This one.](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/37388/?) 




 Obviously ODST but more specifically we do alot of the firefight, helping people get the achievements for them. Occasionally we will do Reach firefight in all ODST armor. 




 I, sadly, just moved and haven't had the money to get Champions Bundle for ODST armor yet but the images look pretty sick:) 




 Thanks but I mean the community:) lol every bit helps! 




 I'm not too sure as to how my followers came with me but at the start I was entirely OP'd with Arcade, Raul, Veronica, Boone,   Follows-Chalk +ED-E, Rex, and Mr. Peepers the Deathclaw. I sent everyone but Boone and ED-E home cause ED-E is my pack mule and Boone is just my back up.

He was using the Gobi Scout Rifle which, combined with JSP rounds, destroys low-life enemys. 




 THANK YOU!! Especially the hud command and the fov's. This will be interesting considering I am also taking a photography class. 




 Let's all give a loud and proud ODST hoo-rah to out very own /u/Afterbang for being promoted to the status of moderator on /r/Halo!

Okay, so I have several notes of business to address. First off, we are very close to breaking our 200 member mark which, for me, is VERY exciting.

Second off, we need more content **PLEASE**! If you have anything ODST related to say, post, or reference, please do! Soundtrack songs, fan arts, poems and short stories, fan fics! Post it all! There is very little we will take down!

Third, Now that school has started for me, I check less often(still close to daily) but I will be trying to arrange at least 1 game night a month! Stay posted for more following once I get settled with everything.

Hopefully you all enjoy our subreddit and keep her strong!
~Mickey, Over and Out
 




 Don't forget he is also the moderator of /r/odst ! Congrats /u/Afterbang !:) Long awaited promotion!  









 AER 14 Prototype and Tri-Beam Rifle. YCS and the Remnants Power Armor 




 "The Lord of the Kings"-About the Kings rise to influence in Freeside and how one leader rose to power. 




 Pause the game Setting  Controls  IDK how to remap I don't mess with that but I'm assuming you click and hold the button you want. 




 Woah I didn't even know there was one for a spear. Shit. I was using the Unlimited Follower mod so I had to lock EVERYONE outside just so I could go in. Killed off all his guards with Recompense of the Fallen, then pulled the knife and went to work. 




 Really? I thought you missed a few if you did that. Hmmm. Okay. 




 The Saints 




 I like the idea of the Tech Raiders added by (I'm assuming) AWOP[A World of Pain mod). They're essentially BoS without nearly as much order and alot more violence. 




 I know for sure Honest Hearts does and as long as you don't go for "Chaos In Zion" you get plenty of rewards. 




 Im doing a small guns/unarmed run currently and it is just so fun. I am with NCR and I raided Cottonwood Cove to get Recompense for the Fallen which, combined with the copious amounts of Rushing Water I have made available, can kill Yao Guai's, Cazadore's, Nightstalker's, and (baby) Deathclaw's with no problem. I would put more points in your Strength and Endurance and maybe the implant for Luck and Agility. I would suggest PN(Project Nevada) cause it gives you an opportunity to get another implant called Razor Nails that raises Crit. Hit and Base Damage of Unarmed. 









 Perk.  




 For a town, RTS. Defense gives you a town no bigger than Forlorn Hope. RTS has no *known* limits 




 I finished building my whole base in like 3 hours and fended off an ungodly amount of raids too quickly. It is really boring once you finish it:( 









 I just realized how deep in thought it is too. Like, "Did I leave the oven on?", "Did I pay my dealer?", "Did I put on my thong?" 









 Kinda like /u/SuperSwammi 's Vault .5
Vault 44 Columbia, MO
The only people allowed in are people with minor psychological disorders (ie. Bipolar, OCD, Depression, Schizophrenia, etc.). All "subject"s are given 4x the normal dose of their medicine through food and water. After 10 years, they are entirely dropped off the medicines and have to live another 10 years without medicine. After the 20 allotted years, the door will open.
Each room is set to bug each persons psychological disorder. So for someone with OCD, everything is offset the smallest noticeable difference but can't be moved. Schizophrenic's will have a small speaker that constantly plays a barely audible conversation. So on and so forth.
There will be 1 9mm pistol in each room with enough rounds for every person in the rooms.
**PLOT TWIST**: Similar to 101, there is an omniscient Overseer. He has no disorders, and is locked in the Overseer's office until the door opens. He cannot communicate with the people, however, he knows about their drug intake. 




 And thank you to Creator Afterbang:) 




 I very much liked The Deterrent, though a bit of the voice acting was rough. I finished the first half of Bounties and [spoiler](/ugh, don't want to relive that ending. Randall was so cool :L). As of now, I am dungeoning A World Of Pain and it adds some pretty hard dungeons that made the game fun for me again.
