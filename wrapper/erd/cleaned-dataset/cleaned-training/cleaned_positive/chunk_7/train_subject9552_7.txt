 I will try the exercise. I could use fresh air. Although I'm also looking for a reason to get myself up. That might be too much too ask considering an answer to that would be multifaceted, I don't know. Even a quote or an anecdote might help, honestly. 




 Maybe this is a stupid thing to ask of you. I'm sorry.
I've been struggling with dysthymia (diagnosed, sorry to say). Sometimes I feel okay because I think I'm getting out of a rut and there are still two things in the world that I care about.
I'm passionate about certain subjects, but I simply cannot bring myself to work. I have hours of work left on my plate today and I have two quizzes and all my homework due tomorrow.
I don't want to do terribly this semester, especially since I've already dropped down to lower-ranked classes, and finals are coming up soon. 
I could stay up and finish my work overnight. But I would be so exhausted and miserable. If I do stay home tomorrow, how would I make myself catch up and work to start Tuesday fresh and prepared? 
What do I do in this situation? I don't want to be like this.
