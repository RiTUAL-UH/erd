 Oliver Season 1 - *"Nobody can know my secret"* / *"Malcolm Merlyn, You have failed this city ... The Undertaking. It ends now."*

andnbsp;

Oliver Season 2 - *"The city still needs saving. But not by the Hood. Or some vigilante who's just crossing names off a list. It needs something more."* / *"Yeah, I'm done. I'm done taking the blame and I'm done caring. Why don't you go have a drink. Get wasted. Go to Verdant. I'll pay for it. I have loved you for half of my life but I'm done running after you"*

andnbsp;

Oliver Season 3 - *" It's more than that. I just... John, tell me honestly... What have we accomplished?"* / *" I don't even have a regular plan."*

 It upsets me that when you search for fanfiction on Wattpad, all you get is something about One Direction or another boy band or YouTuber. Whatever happened to things like idk Spongebob meets Jimmy Neutron, or Avengers vs Justice League, or something that takes a character from a book/tv show/movie and expands their story? What also upsets me, is that if it's not about 1D/YouTubers/etc., it's about Twilight or some movie/show and it always focuses on romance.

andnbsp;

I have recently become quite fond of writing, and I would just like to voice my opinion. 


NOTE: I do not mean to offend anyone, any fandoms, or the authors of the fanfiction genres I dislike.  




 Truth is, this is my first time ever watching a show live. I binged watched Season 1 and 2 then starting watch Season 3 live around 'Draw Back Your Bow'.

andnbsp;

and it scares me to think, that it could end soon :'( 




 Correction: 

andnbsp;

*Lifts Vibrating Hand*


Do you know how hard it has been to keep all of this from you, especially from you? Because the truth is, I've grown quite fond of you. And in many ways, you have shown me what it's like to have a son. 

andnbsp;

*"it" happens*

andnbsp;

Forgive me, but to me, you've been dead for centuries. 




 me too haha. 




 ;~;  




 he can still guest star or come back in later seasons. 




 True.  




 No he doesn't, Harrison Wells asks Felicity to tell him The Arrow's real name, to which she refuses, saying "That's not my secret to tell" (Which is what Oliver told her when they revealed his identity to Barry in Season 2)


Then when coming up with a plan to stop ape-shit Barry, Wells tells Felicity to call Oliver Queen, because they'll need the Arrow's help. 




 First off, we know that H.I.V.E., Damien Darhk, and some more Diggle stuff will be covered in Season 4. But lets look at all of the things they haven't covered. 


(Feel free to give me more things to add to this list in the comments below.)

andnbsp;

* There's no way the China White (Chien Na Wei) story is over
* We've barely seen Komodo
* We haven't seen Onomatopoeia
* Slade Wilson and Digger Harkness were former ASIS members and are both imprisoned on Lian Yu... coincidence?
* More Katana?
* If Oliver meets Hal Jordan or anyone else in Coast City in Season 4, I don't think their relationship will only last 1 season
* Oliver's child
* Merlyn Al Ghul :o
* Though I doubt they'll show this, Lyla Michaels has powers in the comics.
* What if they finally get Blue Beetle on here
* More Diggle/Felicity villains
* I hope to see more Brick
* I can't believe they kinda threw this character away but hopefully there's some way to bring him back, Constantine Drakon
* Jake Simmons/Deathbolt was in Opal City when the particle accelerator went off (Probably will be covered in The Flash though)
* Roy Harper, what's gonna happen with him, will he ever be able to come back to Starling City
* Starling City officially becoming Star City?
* Sara is back, Quentin Lance reaction to that?
* Cyrus Gold.... Solomon Grundy? o_o
* The Huntress ?

___

Okay, that's all I've got for now

___

**EDIT:** More uncovered things:

* Russian mafia flashbacks
* Raisa, the maid from Season 1.
* Thea meeting Barry. 




 Well groddamn. 




 We all know Eddie, Eobard, and Roy Harper are pulling a Malcolm Merlyn, they'll be back in the latter half of Arrow S4 and Flash S2 then be season regulars in S5 and S3. xP 

andnbsp;

EDIT: and by Eobard, I mean Matt Letscher from the flashbacks and a brief moment in S1E23 




 My 2 theories are:

andnbsp;

* He heard Felicity tell Barry "How'd it go with Oliver ... Did he really do the thing with the arrows"
* He asked Gideon 




 "You possess true courage". 




 Because in the song 'Uptown Funk', he says "Don't believe me just watch" 




 Damn... if that's what he mean't, we're screwed. I'm fine with Olicity to an extent, I personally loved those scenes where Felicity would say something inappropriate to Oliver then have an awkward pause, or the "You're my partner", "When you are there (Central City)â€¦ it just made me realise how much I need you here.", and "You'll always be my girl, Felicity" scenes. They just need to learn how to balance the romance and the action. So it's not full on Twilight love story, or not full-on beating up bad guys, like *cough* [This edit of TDKR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J72GOv3G738) 




 Writing an Arrow/Flash fanfiction on Wattpad that probably won't get any recognition due to the millions of stories about One Direction by 14 year old girls. I just got ganked by the whole team in top lane of League of Legends, I was playing Shen, then my team forfeited.

andnbsp;

I might also watch Constantine, sad it got cancelled, I'll see how good it was. 




 Sorry, didn't know how to word it :( 




 I don't think you should be considered a hero until you can protect your city/world all by yourself. 









 Did they ever explain how Barry would return to the current time. If not, how does he do it? How did he use the speedforce to go forward 15 years, if there was no Hydrogen particle colliding with him? 




 You lucky bastard Grant Gustin.

andnbsp;

My Grodd. 














 I write fan-fiction, but like... legit fan-fiction, not anything that pushes romance up your ass. I like to write the supposed continuation of the story. 




 I picked Katie, but I think Katrina Law(Nyssa Raatko/Al Ghul), Rila Fukushima(Tatsu Yamashiro) and Cynthia Addai-Robinson(Amanda Waller) 




 *facepalm* 




 For a second, I couldn't tell if that was Iris West(Candice Patton)... or McKenna Hall(Janina Gavankar).

andnbsp;

Still don't know who it is. 




 LoA.

andnbsp;

Why? Oliver took down Cyrus Gold without a cure. The League is more populated than a couple dozen....or maybe more escaped "super-prisoners", and they are skilled in fighting unlike some, if not most of the prisoners that might be used to street fighting or just using a gun. 




 Dallas Mavericks need to have a Deron Williams, Monta Ellis, Chandler Parsons, Chris Bosh, Lamarcus Aldridge, Dirk team. 




 Warriors win the 2015 NBA Finals. 




 Blue/Gold teams Congrats guys. Got a bit of a scare there near the end. But ~~JR Smith~~ Golden State sealed the deal. Again, Congratulations. :) 




 oops I was supposed to post this on another thread, hence the "Canary Cry" correction, it was some season 4 dc thing, and Katie Cassidy said like "Canary Scream" or something 




 * Dye your hair blonde, Katie.
* Thea get a golden hood/cape
* Please End Olicity
* [John Diggle for Guardian](http://i.imgur.com/ZZxEPzm.jpg)
* Bring back Walter Steele

* Where Art Thou KGBeast
* Slade or Sara Lance backstory?
* Confirmation on Deadshot being alive or dead.
* Oliver/Amanda Waller scenes in flashbacks
* Roy Harper Yellow Hat
* Moar Meta Humans
* Moar city references (e.g. Coast City, Bludhaven etc.)
* Chien Na Wei!!!!
* Ted Grant return
* Ray Palmer funeral scene where he appears and freaks everyone out
* More Season 4 Discussions pl0x, I can't lie in bed eating cookies and gain weight forever.
* No Constantine? Fine, bring him on Arrow to revive Sara
* Don't dwell on the LoA, move on, just some Damien(or Damian idk) Darhk backstory, then move on to H.I.V.E.
* Okay Guggenheim, I know you want to add a bunch of LoA shit, so make Merlyn release Slade for good.
* Dinah Drake Lance backstory, proof of vigilantism before Oliver and Laurel were born.
* or Dinah Drake Lance in a Flash episode if he goes to another universe
