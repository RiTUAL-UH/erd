 That's ... kind of why I've been taking about suicide. To avoid doing nothing throughout my life. Even though to be honest, nothingness is the best thing that has happened to me. Like these past 4 days, I've been doing pretty much nothing and I felt pretty good. 

I know what you mean, but honestly I don't know for how long I should "try", because whenever I do try, I fail. And I mean, I fail. Challenging my depression makes me suicidal, challenging my anxiety gives me a panic attack. I don't enjoy that. I don't want to go through yet another suicidal attempt (unless it's the final one), nor do I want any other panic attacks. It's not fun.  




 I have tried many times but I lose interest immediately. I don't want to do anything with myself, because everything else is boring, which reminds me of the fact that I can't feel pleasure anymore, which in itself is quiet depressive. I don't know. I wish I had another brain. A brain without depression and/or anxiety and/or that stupid personality disorder. I feel restricted in my actions, thoughts and emotions. It really sucks.

And I understand where you're coming from. Life objectively wasn't so good until three and a half months ago, when I decided to change it. Well, I haven't changed. That really sucks.  




 It's nothing about life objectively, it's more like myself. I feel like I am the problem, but most of the things that make me the problem are hard to fix. Like depression, anxiety, a personality disorder ... things that seem to be part of me forever. I don't think I can have a quality life with all three, so might as well not be here.

How about you? What's happening to you?  




 Well, I think I'm one of those people who were born doomed. I have a list of "problems", and most are under the "hard/impossible to fix" subcategory. I'm slowly accepting the emptiness of my future, but I don't want to go through an existence of just. Nothing. I think I'm starting to accept suicide as the only outcome. Maybe the world will be a better place without me. Nah. As I am now, there's no way I'm influencing anything. So yeah. Might as well not be here at all.  




 I wish I could get rid of my vagina.

Well no, that wouldn't fix it. I want to get rid of my uterus and ovaries.  




 I thought Camera. It's actually 'Apps'. : ( 




 I want to be a mother, a wife, and an accomplished professional.

But I know for a fact I'm going to die alone in my little studio apartment lol 




 Are you not allowed to have anything at all in solitary confinement? I think they're allowed to have books, and some times come into contact with other people.

The mental institution I'm talking about was about the same. One girl was allowed to have her bible, the other, a board game. The third kid had nothing, but he was the only one in the whole building allowed to go outside with company (I don't remember why). Not allowed to interact with patients outside your room, no real privacy (at night, everyone hour, someone had to either look through the door window, or actually get in). I guess the only 'plus' was they were allowed to have visits a few minutes a day.  




 I don't know man people have been doing this forever, even in this century, and they're fine.

Go into a mental institution with teens and most are not even allowed to go outside. The most they get are occasional board games. Everyone was fine, actually. Fine and relaxed. Doing nothing for a while can help your mind settle, and the smallest things become adventures. 




 It was 100% cultural. I lived 8 years in the West Indies, and parents are naturally strict, and school is obviously important. Every night, I had to recite, word-to-word, whatever I had to study. Failing to recite all words properly meant not only a beating with the belt (which, again, normal in my culture), but also 10 more minutes to review everything. It might sound "fair", since it means practicing, but not remembering one word meant 10 more minutes, and this could result in a two hour reciting session of a page or two. Also, I had to be good in music. I was good when I was young (3 to 8, I played from age 2 to 12), because my culture believes in perfection, not knowledge. So I didn't really learn any techniques, I learned how to memorize and play notes well. 

As soon as we moved to Canada, my mother changed. I think it was because she was tired most of the time. Back home, my father was the main provider, and now it was her role so she worked a lot (my father still lives in the West Indies). However, I'd get a beating if my report card was not perfect. Sometimes, she'd force me to study, then she'd get tired and just not cared. At some point she started making me memorize the dictionary. We stopped after a few days. Then, age 12 or so, she stopped beating me (thank goodness!) but she was a bit verbally abusive. One day, after a not-so-successful violin practice (I think I was 10 or 11, actually) she made me believe she was going to murder me, and literally spent the day making "my last wishes come true". And I believed it, because she never tried to spoil me before. Thought I didn't do or ask anything because I thought I was going to die. She apologized, but then the next day, she laughed about it with her friends, making it look like she was just "joking with me and I couldn't take a joke". 

Age 15 is when my mother 100% gave up on me. As long as I wasn't failing any classes, she wouldn't give me shit. She's the most disappointed mother ever, especially since she wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer, and recently I dropped out of school to move overseas, in college I learned languages, and I think I just want to be a preschool/primary school teacher. My father is not proud either, but he just doesn't show it. He has given up on me completely last year. 

Sorry this was much longer than it should have been.  




 Ha, same! Right now, I am what seems like 'happy'. And I'm all alone until Monday (have been alone since Thursday). What's even funnier, is that when the people I live with were leaving, I felt nothing. Then when I was alone and saw them drive off (I was looking out the window), I started crying. Me! The coldest person on Earth! I cried! 

It was odd.  




 Learn a new language! :D With duolingo!  




 I like feeling slightly cold.  




 Um, love? Well, as in when people say "I love you". Everyone loves everyone, if we were to believe them. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I truly believe you cannot love more than, what, five people? Unless you have like twenty siblings or whatever. But even then, this love is most probably conditional (a.k.a you're family, I must love you).  




 Nah. Literally just has a new definition/purpose. That happens all the time, but nowadays (with the internet and all) words seem to change way too rapidly. Literally now is used as a way to emphasize whatever is being said. 




 Hair. I like long hair. Any length that isn't considered a short cut will do. As long as I can run my fingers through them.  




 Meh, not many. Though I do talk to a couple of people very regularly, maybe one would consider me a friend. Well, one is a family member with whom I grew up for about 6 years, and I think she feels like she must listen to me because I'm overseas and she's the only person I feel comfortable talking with. The other one is someone I just randomly babble to. She reads whatever I write, sometimes comments about it, but usually just reads. Third person is the one I guess who considers me a friend. Or at least she's really polite. We don't talk every single day, but yeah maybe twice to three times a week or so. 

There are a couple of people I talk with maybe once a month? They're great people, we just don't feel the need to communicate much. 

By the way, those are all happening on social media. Outside of the internet, I have myself only.  




 I went to the grocery store today! I spent just under 12 euros. I am amazed at how much you can buy with so little! I got myself two chocolate/hazelnut yoghourts, a branch (is that what they are?) of broccoli, cheddar cheese, mango/orange juice from a premium brand or whatever, Dove body wash, two packs of underwear linens, and ... yeah I think that's it. Previously, I've been doing my shopping a lot, and I can make myself two meals for just under five euros. Okay, I don't have very expensive taste, but still: two avocados, four breakfast buns and a bag of chicken wings costs under 5 euros, and that's two hearty meals right there. Four, if you're not a hungry hippo like me. Amazing!  




 I'm a fat kid, so I guess I can answer that one.

Of course, the cost of fast food is a problem, but also parenting. Many parents use food to bribe their children, to reward them, to shut them up ... or a beautiful combination of all three. So, you have a bunch of children who basically see food as a complimentary to whatever emotion they must be feeling, from happiness to anger to sadness. It's terrible, and it's especially hard to get out of it. Personally the only reason why I'm still fat is because of emotional eating.  




 I am black, from the Caribbeans. While looking for the name of whatever was growing behind my ear, I fell upon many articles talking about how Keloid scaring and hypertrophic scars were relatively common amongst darker skinned people, especially black people.  




 Well it's better to get it pierced as a baby, even though it's not really the baby's choice. I got my ears pierced when I turned 11, and I got a terrible, terrible infection from it. Apparently it's very common with people of my race, but the scar actually grew out and it formed a little lump behind my ear. I'm glad it was behind my ears because it must have looked really awful. Fast forward a couple of years and it became pretty big, maybe the size of a blueberry, and I had it surgically removed. It cost my mother a ton, since it's considered plastic surgery so it was not covered by insurance. And the worst thing is, I got pierced by a professional at a fancy jewelry store (expensive), and we bought the best gold (expensive) in order to avoid any infections. But my curious self couldn't keep myself from touching my ears, and ... yeah. All of these expenses would have been avoided if I had my ears pierced as a baby. And, turns out, I don't even like earrings so really it was all a waste. 

I think if I were to live in a country where the majority of girls had their ears pierced, I'd pierce my daughters' ears when they're babies in case they choose to have earrings once they're older.  




 Oh wow, I feel the same way. I actually dropped out of college about four months ago, and I cannot wait to go back to school and get a Master's or something.  I want to stay there forever. Actually where I am from, colleges last (if you take the recommended number of credits per semester) two years, and then after you go to Uni. Most of the people I know have graduated and heading to Uni next September. Part of me regrets leaving college, though it was for a good cause (I emigrated).  




 Montreal is a great city. I can't recommend it enough. It is beautiful, diverse, alive ... If you have a bit of money, I would wholeheartedly recommend living in the heart of the city. Not downtown though. That's cliché (though downtown is pretty cool). There is an area called "Plateau Mont-Royal". It's considered Montreal's hipster town. I know, hipsters have that reputation or whatever the internet hates, but I swear this area is incredible. There's everything to see, to do, to eat ... It's so close to downtown, yet it's so casual and just fun to be at. Also, Montreal has a Chinatown that is pretty great for cheap findings and yummy food. Little Italy, as you may have guested, is extremely glorious. Nothing more to say. And we have the gay village. My #1 regret in life is to have not been there. It's awesome, and anyone who goes there says it's really cool. Some of the best restaurants, entertainment is A+. And yeah. I love it. 

And actually, I don't know what exactly make me want to stay in Germany. It's a great country all in all. That's all I can say haha. Actually before moving there I always wanted to live in Europe. My number reason was to distance myself from my family and start anew. I have had a thing for France for the past 6 years or so (plus French is my first language so it would be easier haha) but Germany has a better social system (and free education!!). Plus I'm already there, so if I were to become a citizen, it would be much easier here than in France. Lucky you're in France already!!

And yeah. They have feasts, and those are glorious. In Restaurants, portions are incredible. But in the comfort of their home? Nah. Bread/cheese/ham constitute two meals a day. Two meals! And lunchtime is when they "go nuts". Not saying it's bad, but I am not used to that at all.  




 I guess I am? At least, that's the plan.

103 days (I checked yesterday haha) ago, I left Montreal, Canada, and moved to Germany. My initial plan was to stay there for 12 months, turns out I'll be there for 15 months, and part of me wants that 15 months to turn into a lifetime. 

I came here as an au-pair. Simply put, an au-pair is someone, usually a foreigner, who offers childcare services in exchange of free boarding. It's an extremely cheap way for parents to have someone look after their kids, and a pretty cheap way for young adults to travel, and I'd say 95% of au-pairs are in it for the traveling part. Though personally I did it because I really wanted a childcare experience without having to wait (most childcare jobs require a degree, and I was 18 when I started planning doing that). 

I am not really struggling for now. It's been only 3 months and a half, no real challenges has showed up (except maybe getting a visa, which was granted literally 5 days before potential deportation. Huge stress!). But my life is awesome, I feel extremely lucky to have ended with the host family I am with right now. I owe them quite literally everything.

I'd say the 'real' challenges, if I may call them so, are personal. I thought being away would change me for the good, but turns out I'm the same crappy human being that I was in Montreal. Nothing seem to really fulfill me as a person, happiness is a bit hard to come by even though my life is 110% perfect. My host family is even trying hard to help me with *that*. My only wish is to be the best person I can for them, and I can't even give them the satisfaction of accomplishing that. I'm quite at lost but I am thinking about bettering myself, at least for them.

Oh wait. I did find a struggle. FOOD! I am a stereotypical North-American. Food  everything. I knew Europeans ate way less and much better than us, but never expected to feel so hungry so often. Germans do not eat much, compared to North-Americans. Two of their meals are what we'd consider a snack. Of course, culture. But when I'm hungry, I become really angry and I sound stupid. Actually I posted in /r/germany one day while hungry and I think I offended quite a few there, by saying I was starving and I miss North-American food standards. A family member from the US is actually sending me a care pack and guess what's in it. Snacks!  

Besides, I am not too close to my real family, so I don't miss them at all. I guess I cannot relate to the struggle of missing them and visiting them or whatnot. 

I just don't know what I'll be doing once the 15 months are over. I obviously want to stay here, but then I'd need a reason. I can't be an au-pair for a second year in Germany. I could go on a student visa, but what school would accept a kid who can barely order a pizza because of her limited knowledge of the language? Still, I do want to stay in Europe, and I secretly wish my host family wants me to stay. I think they do, or maybe they're being overly polite? But they have been actively trying to find ways for me to study here. Yeah. I want that. One thing that would help would be to practice speaking German. I really want to! At the same time, I am socially anxious as hell. There are no classes available for now, and I am scared to meet people to talk with them. So yeah I'm quite alone. I don't feel it (yet?) though. I am quite happy with how it is. I shouldn't. 
 




 I was watching the People's Court on YouTube and one video was edited terribly so I just copy/paste the date into the search engine to find a better quality video.  : )

'The Peoples Court May 07, 2015'

 




 Well, technically the Earth has short-term moons. There's always an object that gets caught by its gravitational pull. It just doesn't stay there long enough.  




 No problem! Glad to know you like Markiplier! : ) 




 Haha yeah! but the reason I found this so weird is because I am not an emotional person at all. I mean my own father lives overseas because of work, and I see him twice a year. Never cried about it, not even once. In order to come here, I had to leave my family behind and I have yet to cry about that also. But with people I've known for 100 days, I cried because they're leaving for four days.

Weird.

Enjoy!  




 I don't know how interesting it may be, but my emotions have been weiiiiird today. Ok. Maybe just weird with one 'i'.

I live with this host family in Germany (it's been about 100 days). Today they left to visit family in another region, and they won't be back before Monday (it is now Thursday). As stood by the window as I usually do, saw them drive off and I started crying. 

What's funny is that before that, I was like "Haha, imagine if I started crying haha." Couple of minutes later, my vision was blurry from tears. But I think what triggered it is how nice they were. They acted like they were leaving forever and that they'd miss me. They hugged me! That's like. Whoa. I matter to them, somehow.  




 I know everyone likes to joke about Jaden Smith being weird and all, and yeah some of the thins he says make no sense at all, but his sister and him are the amongst the two most beautiful souls I've ever seen. They're really free-spirited. If everyone were like them, the world would be a much better place. An open-minded, forgiving, intelligent, altruistic, and happy place.  




 No offense taken! Funny, this is exactly me, about 93% of the time. Except today, I'm thinking about a juicy Hamburger hahaha 




 Haha it's crazy how different the food culture is. Especially when Germany has France, Spain and Italy near it haha. I totally understand when you say you need more. That's exactly how I feel about most meals.

Oh well. Let's hope we get used to our new eating habits! 




 Nah I didn't. I'm pretty sure my iron level is low though. Before leaving home, I had it checked and it was at a "critical" level. Yeah it's terrible but I don't take care of it as much as I should. : / 




 Thank you! And back home (I emigrated 3 months ago), a doctor gave me four possible reasons: 

1) Anemia, which I do have and my iron level is always very low  

2) Stress, I do have an anxiety problem 

3) Depression, which I do have 

4) Lack of sleep  

I think it's a wonderful mix of both, but I am so thankful today's doctor did not ask many questions. I had a hard time getting anything back home. I just wanted relief! And I finally have it!!  




 For the past 3 weeks or so, I've been having daily headaches. It's not a new thing because I did have them every single day from 2011 to 2014. 

I went to see the doctor today and he prescribed me something for muscle pain, and I'm feeling so much better! I do feel a bit of pain in my head, still, but it's nothing compared to the hell I've been through.

Sorry this is random! Hope everyone is feeling as good as I am feeling right now!  




 The word exists, but isn't used as a qualitative to describes humans. In the western world, in my experience, this word is used as a qualitative word to describe humans that are pleasing to the eyes, or sexually attractive. Meaning, it has a connotation many people would consider negative, since many people do not want their race/age/ethnic/whatever group to be seen, as a whole, as "good for sex" or "good to look at".  




 Doesn't happen where I am haha : ) We have someone who is always willing to take that last piece, and since I "look" like the kind of person who would take it, I usually give it away haha  




 I think your eating habits are better! I know it's no excuse but I was just really hungry, and I've been hungry for the past 3 months or so haha. Yeah. I'm going through "food withdrawal" if we can say that haha. Thanks a lot! : ) 




 Never said it was a problem, which is why I used quotation marks (lack of a more descriptive term). Also I didn't say it was my surroundings. Said it was different for an American who is used to overeating.

The real "problem" is that I'm broke and hungry.

How about practicing what you teach? I could say the same. This European approach (thinking "Ugh, Americans") is not very apprecisted outside of Europe. Because that makes y'all sound pretentious as hell. 




 Yu don't fully understand my argument. 




 Definitely agree! I was actually looking forward to eating better here. I think I was just upset earlier because I feel hungry so often. It's the worst feeling. I'd rather eat too much junk than feel hungry all the time. My hungry-self is unbearable. I kind of regret posting this. I feel like I've offended many people or rubbed them the wrong way.  




 But nothing is objectively polite/impolite, good/bad, correct/incorrect. It all comes down to what society, and most importantly what the people involved think is right or not.  




 I don't know unlucky I've been, but German food has not come in big 'fat' portions. Trust me. I'm a fat North American.  




 I think differently. I think it's people who just don't want to be your fetish. Obviously that's never gonna happen (a world without fetishizing people), but at least respect the fact that some people feel uncomfortable, and don't so openly talk about how a certain type of people is a fetish because obviously not everyone would be okay with that. 

I was using a general 'you', by the way. 

Kind of like if a red-haired person feels uncomfortable because you call them a 'ginger', well, don't use the word in front of them. Just out of respect. Being nice, you know.  




 They aren't wrong if it's subjective. If you disagree, that's you. But if people don't like the way you see them and talk about them, at least respect that and keep those comments to yourself.  




 Sounds absolutely delicious!  




 Objectively, no. Subjectively, many people find that fantasying about them is objectifying them. And I think we should at least acknowledge that fact. I think this entire discussion started because I said the word exotic was objectifying? Forget the word exotic, say someone says they fantasy about having sex with Thai women. If you were a Thai woman, chances are you'd feel a bit creeped out because this person is seeing you as a thing to have sex with. However, if that person only said "I'm attracted to Thai women.", you wouldn't feel the same. You would feel like part of a group that person considers attractive, rather than a "thing".  




 I totally understand! Would not be offended if someone hated Americans/Canadians eating habits (by the way, it's quite the same). I can also see how, objectively, it can be annoying/problematic to a foreigner. We eat a lot! Too much! And too much sugar and/or too much fat. I understand. But once you're used to it, whoa. Hard to let go.  




 Attraction is: Hmm, I like you/that thing.  
Fantasy is: Oh the things I'd do with you/that thing. 




 You find portions too big in Germany? Oh my, where have you been?

And maybe you mean like quantity, as in eating four pieces of bread. I think that's too much, too, but that's too much bread. Or having like an entire package of cheese. Yeah, that's too much cheese. But as a meal, is it enough? Nah. You need more elements to feel full. 

Sorry I explain so poorly what I mean. 

And yes, I definitely eat too much to European standard. 'Merica. ~~and Canada.~~ 




 I don't mean portions, I just mean sustainability. I don't have great eating habits at all, so I am used to those type of food you eat three bites of and you're like "I'm gonna regret this." I meant hearty, "heavy" meals. I'm unfortunately used to two or three a day.  




 True, but spread some Frischkäse on that thing and it tastes awesome!  




 Yes but you used the word fantasy. That's not the same.

And being attracted to someone doesn't always mean you know the person. I mean you can be physically attracted to a stranger. You can feel emotionally attracted to someone after hearing them speak once sentence. Of course, these are not deep attractions but it still is attraction. 




 Ah I see.

I'm just not used to that. Quantity or variety isn't what differentiate a meal to a snack. My brain is stil seeing bread and cheese as accompaniments only, so eating just that (with something a bit more sustainable, yes, but not on its own) is just foreign.

I hope I get used to it. I wrote this thing while feeling really hungry, so sorry if it sounds like I'm hating on German habits (I am not!!). It's just that when I'm hungry, I just. Want. Food. A big plate full of stuff that will make me cry myself to sleep because I feel fat type of thing.  




 Ah alright. Thanks for letting me know! I don't want them to feel offended or anything. I don't mean that. I am just hungry and I don't play when it comes to food haha  




 Thanks for the tip! 

And man do Koreans eat a lot. I don't mean this as a critic though, I actually like this! I went to Korea for a week and I've never been so well fed in my entire life. It was always plentiful and filling. Only problem was that we were many "hungry foreigners" so in the end, the food did run out haha  




 Yeah my main argument was that there is a difference between attraction to a person and attraction to a thing, which is objectifying. A fetish doesn't always involve sex. I can touch myself thinking about a fetish, it'd still be a fetish. But I used sex in my examples because I thought it would be a clear example.  Guess not.  




 No! Difference is you're thinking about the person or you're thinking about a thing they have only.  




 What do you mean? "Your motivation for attraction is irrelevant". 

You can have sex with someone you're emotionally connected to. You can have sex with someone with whom you're only physically/sexually attracted to. You can also have sex with someone because you want sex and masturbation wasn't gonna do it. 

I'm not splitting here. If you think sex is just sex and has no dimension, then damn. You're missing out.  




 Why are you getting so angry though? That's what I don't get.

Look. If you want to have sex with a person because you want sex with them, you're just being a normal human being. We're animals. Humans, like most other animals, have sex with people they find sexually attractive. Again, my examples about lionesses choosing the lion with the biggest mane. She's sexually attracted to said lion.

Now say lions could have fetishes, and one lioness was like "No but them bald lions though ... So sexy!" That's a preference in her sexual attraction to lions. If she were to say "Baldness turns me on!!!", that's a fetish. 

If you're talking about people who just sleep with others for the sex, that's a whole other topic man. I'm talking attraction here. Not just wanting to get laid.  




 No, you don't get it.

Rubbing genitals because you want to rub genitals with that person is one thing. Rubbing genitals because all you care about is the genitals is something else. Rubbing genitals and rubbing something else because you like that something else is another thing. 

Are you asexual?  




 One is having sex with a person that has features you find attractive, the other is pleasuring yourself while enjoying the presence of tallness, black skin, brown eyes, jokes, and a PhD in physics.  




 That's what sexual attraction is. And literally everyone (but asexuals) feel sexual attraction. "I want to have sex with you". "I see you and I imagine us having sex". That's normal. Happens all the time.

A fetish is "I'm gonna get so much pleasure from rubbing them feet against my scrotum!!" type of thought. It's not the person that matters, it's the thing they have.  




 Then the guy has nothing to do with your initial thought of sex. There is a difference between thinking of sex, thinking about having sex with a specific person, and thinking about sex and how someone's feature (a fetish) is really all you care about since it'll bring you more pleasure.  




 But we're not even talking about the same thing. I'm talking about objectifying bisexuality. Like a man automatically wanting to sleep with you because to him, it means "two hot chicks!!!!" You've become a thing from which he can get pleasure from. And not a person.  




 I don't eat sweets that much, to be honest. Not really a big fan. I like Haribo though. The gummy bears I mean. I see myself eating that from time to time : )

I'll go to EDEKA asap! I didn't know about it, but I did see the brand name written on some products the host family has bought. I thought it was just a brand and not an actual store. Thanks!  




 So far, I only like one brand of chips, and that is Tostitos. I can go through a family pack bag in a day. My personal weakness. The 'nacho' type chips are slightly different. I am not a fan of the taste. 

I like plain Pringles sometimes though. And I've found those! : ) 




 What? No! I'm literally trying to get into your men only island right now. If that wasn't obvious enough.  




 I don't know. Some guy called /u/askronat.

Hey man, looks like we're bonding quite a long. Wanna exchange numbers and dick pics maybe? And talk about how we both hate women and shit? Seems like a nice first date.  




 They're not conservative to me. I think they're just "common" Germans. Of course there are many exceptions in Germany, but whenever I'd google german life habits, under the eating section, bread/cheese/ham for breakfast and dinner was the only thing they'd talk about. 

I do not make that much money, no. I do sometimes go to a Döner and just lose my mind over the deliciousness, sometimes I buy myself a frozen pizza, but this month, I want to save up a bit. I also have a Lidl seconds away from me. I don't find anything that would be considered "junk food" besides sweets, and I don't really like sweets. Or chips, but I'm picky. Yeah. I think the problem is I am very picky with snacks (the only chips I can see myself eating forever doesn't seem to be sold in Germany). And like I said previously, I'd feel bad taking too much space in their kitchen (with piles of food I bought). 

I was hungry when I wrote this thread haha. I understand it's 100% my fault, and part of being in a foreign country is to get used to their life habits. But I have such a deep love story with food, I don't see myself giving up on that one just yet ... 




 Oh no! Again right in the feels. Mate, how you do this? Who trained you to be such a fearless aggressive boy?  




 I feel the exact same way, and I have social anxiety as well. 

In my first year in college, I decided to tell my anxiety to "fuck off", and I forced myself to be sociable. It was hard at first, but I eventually did it. I talked to the people in my program (we had a lounge exclusively for us), made friends with kids older than me, talked, shared laughs, the whole deal. Then, some time in October, I crashed and fell. I failed completely. I walked into the lounge, sat down, and started crying. Couple of days later, I never stepped foot in that lounge. I regretted even trying to be sociable and talking to these people. What happened? Nothing. I just felt regret. Like I was annoying, I was loud, I was uninteresting. Exactly like you.

Sorry I felt like sharing this since your story is so similar to mine. Part of me is happy when I find someone who has gone through the same. It's a hard thing to live through, and it's even harder to explain it to people who don't go through it.

I understand you completely, but we can do it! : ) 




 That's literally what I have been saying though! Bro since comment #1 I've been telling you to go with the men. Glad we're on the same page, finally!  




 Whoa! So much wisdom from this boy! Don't waste it with women! Come on and have fun with the men instead!  




 Honestly, I have zero friends and I get no reminders about what the people I'm friend with on Facebook are doing, simply because I give it zero attention. Facebook nows filters out anything they think you don't care about. So if you don't comment or like something from the same people for a while, you see them less often on your News Feed, until one day you don't seem them at all.

All I see now are things from pages I liked.  




 Seems like being childfree is becoming a trend. 

I'm not following that one.  




 Oh no! How did you figure this out! My deepest secrets now out in the open! What am I going to do with this tragedy!! 




 I'm not mad, I'm trying to offer my most sincere help if women seem so troublesome to you. Become gay! Build an island with only gay men! No women! Woohoo!  




 Of course. 




 Awn little buddy don't be so salty. You can always turn to guys if girls are giving you such a hard time.  




 Awn little buddy who rejected your advances this time?  




 Keyword here: Just. If I have a fat fetish, I'm sleeping with you because you are fat. I don't care about you as the person. You are a thing that is fat. That's a fetish.  




 Hopefully : ) 




 Tostitos and something called [Bear Paws](http://www.peanutfreeplanet.com//v/vspfiles/photos/DAREBEARPAWCHOCOLATECHIP300G-2T.jpg) are favorites. Oh, and fruits. But that comes in waves.

I hate it but I'm somehow of a picky eater. Today I'll love something and eat it until there's no more, tomorrow I'll hate it and actually feel nauseous around it.  




 I don't remember once saying that being a stay-at-home person is a job, since it isn't. Of course you are unemployed, but it's your full-time occupation. You could argue that people who are trained at their job (like master/apprentice type of situation) are unemployed as well. Or doctors still in Residency are as well. But they still have a day-to-day demanding occupation that they choose to be in. If I choose to stay at home and take care of my children/house, it's a choice. Saying I'm unemployed, people will think "Awn poor thing, looking for a job." Saying I'm staying-at-home is more straightforward.  




 You're the only hostile one in this entire thread ...  




 WOW. Sorry about that. Wrong person. I thought you were the same person who said
 Raping children is a crime.
Pedophiles rape children.
Therefore they are criminals.
They are fully aware that it is wrong, but they do it anyway. 




 Sorry must have thought you were someone else when I replied. 

Well again, it all comes down to this idea that exotic = good for sex or food the eyes (that was my main opinion in this thread). As a person with much more to offer, to be seen as just good for sex or to look at is objectifying me. Kind of like, say you had natural red hair, and all the attention you get is from people who fetishizes red-haired women. Would you like that? To be primarily seen as "that thing people dig sexually"? 

Now if some people enjoy this type of attention, cool. Whatever. But many others do not for the same reason (objectification).  




 I see it more this way. "Wow, that person is this. That makes them so attractive". Like if I'm attracted to, I don't know, scientists, I think the fact they're scientists make them attractive. Now if I have a fat person fetish, I just want the fat. Who cares who/what/how the person is. 

That's how I see it.  




 Or maybe help them? Damn I don't know. Put all criminals out of their misery then.  




 But did you read what you wrote as a reply though?  




 Man if you think insulting is the way to go when engaging in a discussion, guess who's the stupid one. 

Not my fault if you don't even want to fucking acknowledge the definition of pedophilia.  




 HA. HA.  




 I don't know who you chill out with, but a friend of mine's dream job is to be a vet. You know how much vets get? It's a shitty job. So is teaching in North America. Shitty ass job. Tons of stress, little money. Yet some people want to do that.

I want to be a stay-at-home person or a housewife because I want to take care of my children full-time. Am I Satan for wanting that?

I'm sorry your stay-at-home mom was shit to you, but stop with this ridiculous whining.  




 Raping women is a crime. 

Straight people rape women. 

Therefore they are criminals.  

They are fully aware that is it wrong, but they do it anyway.  




 Sure! Didn't want to argue. Sorry if it looked like I did.  




 I'm not hiding or anything, I just think that eating too much of one thing doesn't make it a meal. Like eating a bowl of fruit to me is not a meal. 

Obviously it's a subjective opinion.  




 But are you reading my comments though?  If you go to an ISIS comity or whatever and you said ISIS is amazing, everyone would look at you and say "Ok but that's the most popular opinion here right now." If said comity took place in the US, maybe in the US it's unpopular, but still in that comity, the place you stated said opinion, it was a popular one. 

You're on the Western side of the internet. Anti-religion is popular on the Western side of the internet.  




 I like to blame my personality disorder, but honestly I have zero social skills, I am not interesting, and I am terrified of people.  




 Gee. I said you are on the INTERNET from a Western country.  




 But won't that be a problem when it comes to people who will be retiring in the next few years? No money to take care of all of them.  




 Did you read my comment? Pedophiles are people who are sexually attracted to children. Something they cannot help. Those who act upon this attraction are criminals, because sleeping with children is a crime.

Please read before replying.  




 I know, but you avoided my comment completely. I said you are on the internet and in a Western country, and everyone and their mama are anti-religion. 




 Exactly. The subject was pedophiles, who are not criminals. 

I am very chill, actually.  




 You're acting like unemployed people are second class scums. Gee. I'm sorry you are forced to work until you're 65.
