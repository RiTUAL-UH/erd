**Convergence Titans #1**

**Convergence Question #1**

*Image*

**Savior #1** Raised religious, but the solicit sound like another "What if there was a superhuman among us" type comic.

*Marvel*

**Ant-Man #4**

**Captain Mavel #14**  Black Vortex (I hate having to add more comics to my pull due to cross-overs)

**Darth Vader #4** Decent enough so far

**Deadpool #45** "Death" of Deadpool. What's $10 (minus 15% pull list discount) for a "milestone" comic?

**Hulk #14**

*Valiant* 

**Imperium #3** As always I enjoy Valiant and this is no exception

**Rai #8**  I need to re-read it all, but have still enjoyed it.

I really should start limiting my budget. . .Looking through the replies only a couple have as much or more than me, which is probably not a good sign. 




 I don't a single one of these minus Saga in trade form. . . 




 Comixology is having a massive sale on Crossed. I was wondering which runs are worth getting. 




 Well to be fair many states just require you to be 18 to be able to serve alcohol. 




 If they put as much work into their movies as they do their comic books (as in I can't find a single issue I dislike) then I can't wait for their movies. 




 It is kinda how everyone jokes Batman's power is that he **is** Batman.  




 Yea thats the Beowulf I am thinking about. 




 Not to mention overwhelming the wallet. 




 Did Beowulf ever show up? I kinda sorta remember reading a Beowulf feature in the New 52 DC presents that involved Camelot. 




 Spaceman by Vertigo. 




 And in Eureka7 there is a character named Stoner. . . 




 Hopefully Del Toro can be a producer at least. 




 Nope you are not alone. 




 Exactly. Post Convergence isnt New 52 anymore. 




 There were also Futures End One-Shots of most titles, but very few linked up at all to the main weekly and for the ones that did it wasn't anything significant.  




 I think it may still be a possibility since isn't DC dropping "New 52" post-Convergence? 




 How about plastic man? Could be like a rival Kirby or something. . . 




 So did anyone else notice similarities between Locus and Fifty Sue? Their powers seem very similar. . .

On a side note: The last time we see Sue she has entire DNA vault in her possession. So would it be possible at some point she decides to join back with Cadmus? 




 It did sort of have a set up for Justice League 3000. We get the explanation of how Cadmus is having DNA of most Superhumans.  




 Is Gemworld ever gonna have a new series? 




 **NEW 52 FUTURES END #48** 




 A decent setup of what is to come. 




 I want Babs and Jason to be a thing :/ 




 This was my first Doctor Who Comic and I surprisingly enjoyed it. 




 **DOCTOR WHO 9TH DOCTOR#1** 




 There was an Anderson Psi-Division mini series IDW finished not too long ago. I really enjoyed that one. 




 That doesn't bother me one bit. I guess I will check it out. 




 Well the Vertigo Quarterly went for this much. 




 How is this series? I've been thinking of playing catch up. 




 I didn't see that coming regarding who Wells is/was. . . 




 Yea man, when you hit that Speed Force...it is like you become a part of something greater than yourself. 




 ...but Sandman links up with Lucifer. . . 




 2nd to last issue...can't wait to read it. 




 Gonna pick up issue 15 forward tomorrow. Thanks for the heads up! 




 I thought I read an article a year or so back stating they had to redesign the Batsuit somewhat because there was an issue of mobility. . . 




 I really enjoyed it and they did a good job character building. I lucked out and my LCS still had one copy left, but I am not sure I added to my pull list so I have to get there early tomorrow. By the looks of it you can still get it at IDW's website. 




 Evangelion was one of the first Anime I watched :3 




 I ended up getting Wonder Woman, Batgirl, Batwoman, and Supergirl from this sale. I enjoyed them all, but Batwoman had several 2 page spreads that at times made reading difficult. 




 Make sure to check out Lucifer. Also a good series.

 Umbral is a favorite by Image.

Citizen of the Galaxy by IDW #2 gets released this week and I really enjoyed the first issue. 




 Hoping Shadowman is a main player in this one. 




 When I found out that you can take college courses, while in high school, for credit towards both, I was a little pissed off. It would have saved not only time, but also money. 




 It is mostly single issues, but they are pretty fast in releasing volumes. As for the Scribd service, I am not sure how they have them on there. 




 I really enjoyed Rai, Eternal Warrior, and Shadowman. The latter have concluded, but Rai is ongoing. Honestly, I havent found a Valiant comic that I do not like yet and I've started most of them. Check out Scribd for a near complete collection of Valiant comics in digital form. Occasionally Valiant will have a Humble Bundle. 




 Just waiting until the Tula Lotay Art Book drops on April 1st. I really enjoyed the comics she has been a part of and would love to get something like this of hers. 




 Since I don't mind digital, Marvel Unlimited is an excellent resource. Even if it is single issues at a time. 




 At the end of 2013 Google play had a **massive** sale of N52 trades, which is actually what got me into comics. Like 3 or 4$ each. Just keep checking there each week to see if anything is on sale. One time they had The Walking Dead Compendium (Yes the huge collections) 1 and 2 for less than 10$ total. 




 Definitly the Death: Deluxe Edition. Excellent stories about Death of the Endless (Sandman Mythos). It is such a good deal for all it has. 




 Ohhhh this may explain why Supergirl Vol. 2 is not on the play store. 




 Is it on Netflix or Hulu yet? 




 I figure it is a 4:1 shot a BvS trailer (even just a teaser) debuts with the Avengers 2 movie. I mean would DC really give up such an oppurtinity to advertise on one of this year's biggest releases? 




 I sure wished I did, but I am one of those souls that must read every series from the beginning even tho I consider jumping in at N52 not a bad start. Considering I started with comics in December 2013, I don't think I will ever catch up.
 




 I am trying to decide between Wonder Woman, Supergirl, and Batwoman. Might go ahead and do all three, but the other titles such as American Vampire and even Fables and Ghost are hard to choose from. I might just have to go by a pages/cost ratio to decide.

Either way, I **highly**  recommend the Death: Deluxe Edition. I have the physical copy and it is still a such an amazing deal on such a good story collection (even if you are completely new to Neil Gaiman's Sandman and the Endless Mythos) that I am considering buying it in digital form, which at just 1¢ a page is a massive steal. 









 Considering Image is way faster than DC/Marvel in getting their trades out after the last issue in it, I am not surprised. 




 I second Outcast. Apparently the series Weaveworld is pretty good, but have yet to read it despite picking up the first trade (good luck finding this one, it was released in the 90's). 




 Haven't really been following the tourney....but why no Valiant series? Is this just the Big 2 plus Image and Dark Horse? 




 This is beyond tragic. My LCS does 15% discount with free bags. I occasionally order from Midtown, but I like to keep going to mine because I like the people and enviroment.

 Is your store at least going to attempt a digital retail conversion? 




 So much this. Half the time I forget about a spoiler by the time I get to reading a comic. Of course, half the time I don't get to the comic until Thursday or the following weekend. 




 I just read Vol. 6, which had Ramadan in it, last night and i really enjoyed it. The story was interesting and I sort of want to read into middle eastern lore after it. The fact Iraq was/is still a war zone is a humbling fact 20 years after this issue was published. 




 Have it on my pull list, but can't get until next week:(  Been loving it so far. 




 Like /u/bliffay said it originated from the Lil B fanbase. He is a somewhat underground rapper (I don't he is signed and is still independent) and has a huge presence on the internet. I remember he released a 100 track mixtape once for free. I don't really follow him tho. . . 




 Finally, it seems, Vertigo is getting consistent love. 




 I have about 5 issues to read of this series, been buying them, but havent read them yet. . . 




 I need to order this. I've been following this series via trades and have absolutely loved it. 




 It is on my pull list, but I can't pick it up until next week. I have to save my money for a Tula Lotay Art Book that is releasing April 1st and I suspect the shipping is gonna be a bitch. Enjoyed the first issue and can't wait until I can read this one. 




 I'm with you on this. Tyrese, I think would make a decent GL. 




 My LCS usually gets me the variant cover for titles that I have on my pull list. Occasionally, I will get them from Midtown comics and they will generally have them ready for pre-order. 




 Valiant relaunched a couple years back (they were around in the 90s) and practically all their titles are excellent. If you want comedy, Archer and Armstrong or Quantum and Woody are great series. If you like mythical/magical, Shadowman is decent. Eternal Warrior is about one of the most prominent characters in Valiant and is contained in two trades. Can never go wrong with X-O Manowar with it being pretty much Valiant's flagship title. 

On current series not yet in trades: Ivar, Time Walker is fun and you don't need to know too much about the Valiant Universe, but it definitly will help make connections. 

Keep an eye on Humble Bundles, I managed to get a good chunk of Valiant trades for not very much. Or perhaps check out Scribd since Valiant has a good amount of digital issues in this service.

Also /r/valiant 




 I think Shadowman should at least have one or two vols in the middle of Quantum and Woody so you have some background for the heist, even if it isnt a real crossover. . . 




 Wounded Rhymes, easily. 




 I love the free digital version. It lets me sell off issues I don't want so I can buy a couplw more. 




 Lykke Li features always brighten my day. 




 She's done a couple collaborations with rappers. One of my favorite is Gifted with Kanye and Santigold. 




 He was stuck holding a beam that would otherwise crush Aunt May. 




 Lykke Li easily. 




 What do LCS get from me putting down my Marvel Code redemptions at their store? 




 I rumble when I yawn and cant hear anything half the time.  




 Sadly so much so. 




 I highly recommend this series. The artwork is great and the story actually moves along at a good pace. 




 Sandman

XMen Apocalypse

Star Wars 7

AntMan 

Suicide Squad

Fantastic Four

Avengers2

Deadpool

BvS

Green Lantern

 




 Didnt Dwayne Johnson confirm he is Black Adam? 




 So much on the trade release. Image gets it right in this regard. I hate having to wait for the next DC trades after so long. 




 Free Digital copies with the purchase of physical copies.  

Make more Netflix Series.

Live Action JLD.

Give Klarion a better run.

1 event maybe 2 a year.

Crossovers not nearly as much or as long.

Not make trades come out several ARCS after the fact. Kinda like how Image does what? Like a month after the last issue in a trade.

DC Unlimited.

Make Humble Bundles for at least older comics.

Make sure Elektra actually lasts for a decent run.

Make flagship issues longer with "shorts" in the middle. Like a Batcow short story in Batman.

More easter eggs and no more white borders. We need more art to look at while reading.

And an all New Crossover between the universes.
 




 Ivar Timewalker is an excellent series that is only a couple issues in, if anyone is wanting something easy to jump into by Valiant. 




 I must have missed the news on a Bloodshot movie. Sounds awesome. 




 Save 20$ for their next humble bundle. Im still only about halfway through the ones they have had. 




 I imagine the gap will close, but once we get closer to the movie in December it will grow again. 




 This album is always first in my library whenever I get a new device. The first line is so unexpected and the album just continues to deliver. 




 This seems like a pitch for an excellent Dave Chappelle skit, if that show still existed. 




 I've been playing Pixel Heroes on android. All the nods to pop culture is entertaining.  




 The last issue was so hard to understand. The art is still pretty good. 




 I think it was the 07-08 school year. 




 If he was class of '14, I don't think he would have had the pleasure of knowing Moretta, sadly. 




 The integration was in 1955 and was the first in all of Dallas. 




 For the Non-Catholic/Secular Private schools we also have St. Mark's and Hockaday. 




 What would Mr. Moretta have to say about this?  




 Ursuline is also the Sister school of Jesuit. 




 If anyone can figure out the BB suit it'll be Tim. 




 This was my first thought. Of course I mostly DVR because I work at night, however, it is nice the days I dont work to watch the shows live. 




 Can we get a quality post tag? 




 But then again the title does say Unlimited Budget...
