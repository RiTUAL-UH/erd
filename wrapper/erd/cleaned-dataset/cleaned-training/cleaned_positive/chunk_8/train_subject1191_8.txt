 Same here. I really need the money to personal expenses and to help my mom, but I feel just like you. I had a job for a while and it was a really bad experience, not because of the job, it was just my anxiety. I quit and went to a psychiatrist, got meds but they didn't work, so I stopped. That was 2 years ago, I know I should looking for a job, but I just can't. I don't know how to live. I don't know why we are the way we are. Sometimes I think and get scared what would I do if I didn't have the support of my family. I really don't know.., I don't know what will be the end of this.
