  It's kind of strange, you said most of what has been going on in my head, and a lot of our situations are similar. It's really frustrating and you want it to all go away, but it won't. I don't know how to cope with my problems yet, so I can't give any advice, but one of the main problems I have is that I feel completely alone. So just to let you know, you are not alone, because there are other people who feel the same way
