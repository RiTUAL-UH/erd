 And that is why I am getting out of here. They deserve better, I deserve better, he deserves nothing from us. 




 Thank you. Every day I come back and read my posts, and every day it feels as though someone else must have written them. How could I have let him treat me like this?  




 I agree. And after my therapy session today, I can see that even more clearly now. 




 Oops, I kind of skipped over his body. Something else caught my eye :-) 




 I am lucky to have an M S and a Waitrose where we will be living. But I think realitically it will be Tescos and Asda for a while :-)

He really will be missing out on so much. Our youngest is only 4. More than likely he will not remember his Daddy living with us. 




 Thank you. I am trying to tell myself that, and I am trying to believe it.

But it is hard when I think of all the pain I am going to cause my babies. 




 I am consulting with a solicitor in the UK. I am also going to be applying for fulltime residency of the kids. This is pretty much the same as the old term full custody. He has already agreed to give me full custody so that he does not need to be constantly tracked down for counter signatories on everything when he is in different countries, but I am prepared to fight for this if he starts to make things hard.
 




 Thank you. I was trying to find a way to explain how I felt and you have made it a lot easier.

I am trying to make sure that when we leave, I have enough money for myself and the kids for at least two months. My parents have already said they will make sure that I do not get into financial problems, and I have lists of resources I can acess as soon as I have a date to fly back. 

Thankfully the company he is out here with are incredibly helpful and I known that if I contact them, they will at least pay for our flights back. I have asked him to contact them as he is obviously the employee and it is his responsibility to contact them with stuff like this, but he has not yet. If he has not done it by the end of the week, I will call the DC office myself. I know the guy there and I know he will do all he can to support me and the kids.
I also found out that under UK law I am entitled to half his pensions savings to date. I really don't want to screw his pension up as it is not a lot anyway, but if he decides to start making things difficult I will take him for all he has.

Sorry for sounding harsh, but the emotional pain is getting to me tonight. Realizing what he has done, and how he is treating me, I am glad I see my therapist tomorrow, I certainly need to vent to someone, 




 I gave him the therapy ultimatum. He didn't turn up. That was the day he truly broke my heart because I realized that whereas I would do anything for him, he was not prepared to feel uncomfortable for an hour listening to advice that could help him save what he was loosing.

I suffer with a joint condition that causes me to tire easily and I am usually in pain. Despite this, I have never stopped him from doing anything. In the last two weeks I have had uncontrollable stomach pain. I have been dosed up on Percocet and antinausea pills. He told me it was probably stress and all in my head. My Dr diagnosed that it is either an inflammation of the lymph nodes in my stomach which make you feel like you have appendecitis, or old surgical scars are sticking together inside my abdomen, and pulling in nerves causing pain. I actually asked my Dr if it was all in my head, and he was shocked that someone had even thought to tell me that.

I think he just doesn't want the day to day responsibilities of being a husband and father. He wants everything to go his own way, on his own terms, and exactly when he wants it to happen. 




 Thank you. It really does feel as though I am 'waking up' to be able to see what he is doing.

I still feel conflicted, but because I never believed he was the kind of person to treat me like this. But I guess the further I take myself from the situation, the clearer things become and the more I can focus on the kids and my needs. 




 I agree. And if anyone else was in this situation I probably would have told them to get out a long time ago.

But time, love and percieved security do strange things to you.

Now I am waking up and taking back my life, and ensuring my kids are safe, loved and happy. 




 Thank you. I will. 




 Lol @ supermarkets. Is it wrong that I am looking forward to a nice roast dinner at my dads house?

It sucks in so many wats, you are quite right. 

This is why I love you all here in this subreddit. I can write down my crazy thoughts and feelings, and no one tells me that I am being silly. No one puts me down for expressing myself. I can get my thoughts in order, and great advice and support at the same time.

I seriously doubt he will do much in the way of housekeeping. I honestly suspect he will just hire someone to come in and keep the place clean enough for him.

I have already told him that if he expects the kids to visit over here, then either I or a family member will be coming too. It is way to much to expect the kids to cope with something so big. And he will not cope with them resenting him if they do, or not listening to him etc.

And to be completely honest, he would still do his gaming, just like he does now. He will lego avengers or lego batman on the playstation and they will play that whilst he does his own thing. That is what he does when I keave them with him now.

How much of a fool am I for letting this go on for so long just because I love him? 




 Unfortunately not. I really need the time to ket the kids finish this term at school, they have worked so hard towards end of term treats and performances and I dont want to take that away too.

 The time will also let me get two months of my own wages together for money to take back with me. I can also get on the list in that time for council housing. It takes time to do things properly and I am prepared for it to be incredibly hard.

If things get abusive here, I have somewhere to go with the kids to see out the time. If he cannot handle himself with dignity and respect, he can go stay in a motel.

Now that I am the ine making the decisions, I feel stronger in a way. I also know I have the support of friends here and in the UK.
 




 The plans are coming along for us to go. I am arranging accomodation for me and the kids, temporary at first and living with family, but I am also trying to get us our own little place.

I have felt for a while that he sees them as my kids for the most part. They are his kids when he wants something, or they are being easy to look after. But given that they are 4 and 7, a boy and a girl, they are rarely easy to look after :-)

He wants all the glory with none of the work. 




 So many people have said he wants his cake. 

I agree. But when you have done everything to keep someone happy for 14 years, it is hard to stop yourself from always saying yes.

The more I write here, the more I see that he is manipulating me emotionally. And it hurts so much that someone I love with all my heart, someone who promised to love me forever, would do that.

I know that the kids and I deserve so much better.

I just need the sanity of the people here on r/relationships to see me through until I can get back to the UK. Hopefully all will be arranged for us to go in the next 12/14 weeks. It seems like a long time, but there is a fair amount to arrange, and I really want the kids to beable to finish their school terms here. My daughter has a school play at the end on term and she has been rehearsing for it since Xmas. I can't take that away from her too. 




 I understand your question.

Yes, things keep on changing. One day he is loving and kind, the next he is ignorant and mean.

One day he wants us to stay together and try to love me again, the next he won't even look at me.

He is playing with my emotions I know and I am trying to stay strong,

Writing in the subreddit gives me a kind of clarity. I go back and read my posts. I read the things he has said and done and it kind of makes me more resolute in my beliefs. It reminds me why I am making these plans for a future without him.

He has been stringing me along on a hope that he will suddenly fall in love with me again. But the more it happens, the more I realize that he is manipulating me.

Please don't hate me for still holding on to hope. Hope is failing now. But sometimes it is easier to reach out and embrace that shred of hope, just so that I can pretend to feel loved for a little while.

I am trying to put up and emotional wall between us now. If I don't let him in, he can't hurt me as much, can he? 




 Thank you. It is hard trying to figure things out. Thankfully I have r/relationships to give me good advice and a sounding board to try and get my thoughts in order.

I also have a friend here who has made herself available pretty much 24/7 to let me rant and rave, just trying to figure what a 'normal' relationship would be like. 

I am seeing my therapist tomorrow. She usually lets me get my emotions and anger out and then we work on building my self confidence so that I feel comfortable in my descisions,

It would really help if he would accept that talking to someone other than me would help. But he refuses to talk to friends, family, a counsellor.

I cannot fix him anymore. I have to put my kids and myself first. Even if it hurts. 

I am so scared that by leaving him I will be making a huge mistake. I am scared of everything to be honest. 




 Everytime I write an update I end up realizing what I am writing. I see what he is doing. But he has me doubting my own mind so much that I am questioning my own mind and actions. Am I overreacting? Am I reading what he says the wrong way? Am I expecting too much or the wrong things from him? And so it goes on.

I will be leaving in 12/14 weeks, once all the arrangements are in place. Even though it hurts like hell, I am starting to see that I deserve more than this. The kids deserve more than this. It just kills me to have to do it. 




 Exactly. He has no idea what he wants, but will not accept help to work on this. He wants everything and nothing at the same time, and it is everyone elses fault.

Second update: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22ghra/update_2_to_i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years/

Ok. It has now been three and a half weeks since he intially told me that he no longer loved me.

We have talked and talked, but I am becoming more and more confused by his attitude toward me, the kids, the future.

He is swinging between being very open emotionally, talking things through in great detail, what he feels about us moving back to the UK. Then the next day, he is grumpy, ignoring me, neglecting his time with the kids, flaking out on plans to do things with the kids. One day he cannot do enough to help out, the next I am having to ask him to come and say goodnight to the kids because he can't be bothered to come upstairs.

He dedecates most of his time to playing on his PC and working out. Just saying that makes me realize that he is still such an adolescent. I don't think he has ever lost the mentality that he is his own person and he can do whatever he likes. Yes, that was true, but I believe that when you have children, you have to have a balance in your life towards what you give to your family, and what you give to yourself.

He told me the other day, when he was in a bad mood, that he feels that he has to support me too much (an example was having to come and get me when my car broke down) and because of my health problems he feels he has to look after me too much. He told me that I was living my life like I was in the 1950's and that men aren't expected to look after women like that anymore.

He seems to have neglected the fact that I work full time, look after the kids for 75% of the time on my own, he goes out at least twice a week for social stuff, and that tomorrow I am having to run him around because his car broke down! Yes I do have health issues, but I have had them since we met, and they are actually much better now than when we first got married!

I had to apologise to him earlier this week, because tomorrow I need him to miss his games session after work because I have therapy and I cannot get anyone else to have the kids (it is around dinner time, so kind of hard to arrange pick up and drop off). 

I feel that I should not be having to apologize for going to a session that was the only one left this week when I booked it two weeks ago. I asked my therapist to reshedule, but her calendar is full and she really wanted to see me this week. He has know about the appt since I made it, but at no point did he offer to come home to have the kids.

He keeps asking me to stay. But not as a couple, as two people living in the same house who have kids together, but no relationship. He keeps telling me how much better it would be for me and the kids to stay. He says I could save up money from my job before moving back, the kids wouldn't have to move etc. And the more he says it, the more I feel like I am the bad guy here, taking the kids away from everything they know and love. Yes, I could do that. But is it worth the pain?

I keep feeling so confused about what is the right thing to do. But how can I stay? If I could be sure that everything would be ok and stable for the kids, then I would. But on days like today, I can see that this is not a healthy environment for me or the kids.

I am starting to feel that he is manipulating me to make me stay. To make me feel guilty for hurting the kids by moving. To get rid of his guilt over the choices he has made. To make me the bad guy making the descisions.

I really feel he is forcing my hand here. And it is really starting to affect my ability to judge things properly. I no longer am sure that I can make the best decision for the kids. What if I am making the wrong choice and ruining my kids lives because of this?

My friend was over today and saw for herself how he can make me feel bad for wanting something for me and the kids.

I asked him if he had arranged a lift for the morning (he is prone to forget stuff like that) and he told me no, he would take my car 'if that was ok' and just do a half day to get home. I told him that I had plans for the morning with the kids, and he told me that he 'only needs it for half a day' . He just had no concept that he would be making me and the kids stay home when I had promised to take them out. I told him I would drive him in and out, and then he started demanding to know what time I would pick him up as he 'had to look after the kids for me'. My friend, who knows the situation, was just shocked to see first hand how he has no idea about how his actions affect others.

He says that a lot. That he is doing stuff 'for me'. Not doing it because he is their dad, but as a favour. So that I owe him. 


**TL;DR** Am I being guilt tripped into staying by a man who tells me he doesn't love me?


**edit** I meant to add that because I saw my OBGYN last week and told her the situation, she ran a full STD panel on me, just in case. Everything came back negative, so I have that going for me, which is nice. 




 Good luck and I hope you find yourself able to give us a positive update soon xxx 




 All I can think of tonight are his poor little daughters. To be on such a high seeing their Dad inducted into the HoF, then to loose him so suddenly just three days later. 

Heartbreaking. 




 Thanks. Having between two and four kids to look after this week is certainly keeping me moving, even if I am supposed to be resting! 




 No, he has not always been like this. I guess reflecting on our life together, he has always gone through phases of being a very involved and loving father and partner, and then phases of making me feel as though the kids and I are a burden to him.

He would be moody, distant, grumpy with the kids. But never to this extreme. 

Now (since telling me it is over) he is being loving, more communicative, more attentive to the kids. And I think that it is because he is realizing what he is loosing.

But I have to be strong. I keep coming back here and looking at how he has treated me and the kids. How he has tried to make me feel guilty for ending the marriage.

I am torn between wanting to belive he cares for me, and thinking that this is all just a way for him to try and persuade me to stay, just so he doesn't get his feelings hurt, and to relieve himself of the guilt of leaving us.

It is incredibly hard for me because I am a person that will always try to see the good in people. I want to believe there is goodness and truth in this world. But I know that sometimes, even though it hurts, I have to accept that people lie to me for their own personal gain, regardless of my own feelings. 




 I know :-(

I have to keep coming back to this thread and re-reading what I have written. He keeps asking me to stay. I am losing my best friend and my husband. 

But I can't go back to that way of life again. Even if he promises it can be different.

But it is so hard when my heart just wants to be loved. 




 Thank you 




 Thank you. Unfortunately contact is going to be happening whether we like it or not, until I am able to move back to the UK. The crazy part is, that we have not talked like this, or been so close in a long time. If only he had been able to talk to me about how he was feeling a long time ago, maybe we could have got through this :-( 




 I do wish I could stay off my feet, but it is Spring Break and the kids are so excited to do the stuff we have been planning for weeks. I have modified days out though so that I can get more rest and time to sit down. Thankfully their attention spans aren't that long, so we usually end up going out for half a day and then coming home to play. 




 Thank you. Having come from a broken home, I have felt first hand what it is like to live with bitter and twisted parents, and I have sworn never to do this to my own kids. 




 Thank you. It is just so good to hear my Dr confirm that it is not all in my head. That I am genuinely in pain and there is actually nothing I can do about it. 




 Thank you, I am looking into using my dads solicitor back in the UK, just to be sure everything is written down and legal.

I know how the kids will probably feel, and that is making me feel ten times worse. My parents divorced when I was 10, admittedly in far less friendly ways than I am going through now. 




 Thank you.

First update:http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/229eea/update_to_i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years_has/

First, I want to thank off you you who gave me such support and advice on my previous posts.

We have talked more since agreeing to separate than we probably have in the last two years. Proper, intentional conversations, talking about our emotions, how we are doing etc.

He wants me to stay here, even though he doesn't love me. I have told him that I cannot do that. It is not fair on any of us. He understands this, and as others have told me, it is like he wants to have his cake and eat it too.

I am making progress in planning for the kids and my futures. He has agreed to pretty much cover any and all costs with the separation, divorce, moving, setting up a new home etc. I will be sure to make sure his commitments are recorded legally to ensure I am not screwed over in a few months.

He has been very emotional the last few days. I think the enormity of the situation has hit him and he has realised what he is going to loose.

He still says he does not love me, but also does not want to loose me as I am his best friends.

It is incredibly emotionally draining and I am very tired of everything at the moment.

I saw my Dr today as a follow up to my hospital visit last week. I asked him if this pain I am suffering could be purely from stress. He said that the stress is not helping, but that he is sure it is not the cause of it. He feels that I either have mesenteric adenitis which is an inflammation and/or infection of the lymph nodes in the stomach which causes appendicitis like pain and can last for two weeks, or I may have abdominal adhesions that have grown since my last surgery. Because the mesenteric adentis is essentially self healing, I have to wait five days, and if the pain has not improved at all, he will be asking for me to undergo a laparoscopy to try to identify if there are adhesions, and to remove the cyst on my left ovary.

I am glad that I am not imagining this pain, as I had started to feel that way. My husband even suggested that it was all in my head last week, after I came out of the hospital.

Any advice on what I should be planning for would be appreciated. I will be most likely moving myself and the kids back to the UK in about 10/12 weeks.

Thank you.


**TL;DR**: My husband has no idea what he is doing, or what he wants. 




 He has my user name and he knows that I have posted here. 

I doubt he will read it though as he already know what people will be saying about him.

He is even too scared to tell his family. He is trying to avoid making any decisions about the future, so I am being proactive and basically researching everything I can for my benfit, and then telling him what is going to happen.

I will not let him have this power any longer. Even though I am falling apart emotionally, I have to be strong for my kids, to make sure I can give them the most loving, supportive home I can through all of this. 




 Thank you 




 Genuinely scared the hell out of me! 




 True :-) 




 He has such a lovely speaking voice, very gentle for such a huge guy. 




 Thank you 




 Thank you 




 Thank you.  




 Thank you 




 I certainly wouldn't be relying on them, I just know that they would not allow him to skip out on his duty as a parent.

We have to provide a written statement of our intentions to the courts for the divorce to be processed and he would be held to this from then on.  




 Thank you. I know I deserve better, but years of serving everyone elses needs and wants makes it very hard to break free. But I will. 




 I am getting everything in writing. I think his family would basically disown him if he tried to not provide.  




 I am making copies of anything he is messaging me. Is that ok? I will also be sure to get a written agreement too. I think his company have someone here who can help us with it. 




 I have been posting in r/relationships for advice, and had a post in r/anxiety on a throwaway account three weeks ago (mythrowayayisaokay).

The relationships post explaining most stuff is here - http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/229eea/update_to_i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years_has/ It is long and has a few previous post links in there too.

Basically my husband told me our marriage of nine years and relationship of 14 years is over as of this morning,

I have been waiting for him to make this decision for three weeks, dealing with him being nasty, cold, over-attentive in that time, whilst he tried to work out what he wanted.

I have also been in and out of the Drs and the ER with crippling stomach and side pains that are, as yet, undiagnosed cause. I am guessing stress might be high up on the list of causes.

I have spent the morning occupying myself with factual matters. Looking at how to get a divorce in the UK, how to find accomodation for myself and the kids, what I am going to need financially, finding a counselling service for children for when we move out etc.

I know I am doing this to block all the emotions and mental anguish out, and I am scared what is going to happen when I stop thinking. I am scared that I am going to break down completely. I am scared that the pain issues I am suffering with are going to get worse. I am actually scared that I am going to loose my mind over this. 

I have to stay strong for my children. I have to stay strong for me. But I just don't know how.

I have an appt with my therapist on Thursday and I emailed her today to confirm the aoot and to let her know about todays developments. I am seeing my Dr on Monday and will talk to him about this then.

I have emailed my parents to tell them what has happened too. I have told them that I am not ready to speak to the face to face (well, on the phone and skype) yet. They are being very supportive.

I just feel like I am balancing in the edge of a massive pit of despair. And I am so scared I am going to fall in soon.

I can feel the anxiety and depression waiting for me to let my guard down. Ready to take over everything. 




 He is already agreeing to basically pay for anything and everythihg the kids need. He is also looking at how to send me back to the UK debt free. He will also be paying for all of our living costs until I can find work.

As much as I hate what he is doing to us, I cannot find it in me yet to hate him. And for the sake of the kids and all the interactions we will need to have through the years, I would rather try to keep this as amicable as possible. 




 I usually go with 'Ohshitwhatthehellareyoudoingdownthere' rather than 'Cleo' :-) 




 Thank you 




 Thanks 




 Thank you. Unfortunately he cannot move out as the house we are in is tied to his job. We have agreed to wait it out 10/12 weeks here until I move back to the UK.  




 My four year old suggests Miaow-Miaow, my seven year old says Fluffy. I think she should be called Sapphire after those lovely eyes. 




 Thank you 




 Thank you.  




 Thankfull all healthcare here is fully covered by his company. 




 Thank you 




 Thank you 




 The problem is that I do all of that work to please him, and I know this is all kids of wrong. I guess I am still so desparate for this to work that I am not considering the pain I am going through by staying, rather than facing the pain of leaving. 




 I guess so :-( 




 I took my pain meds, not him. He is not **that** much of an asshat :-) 




 Therapy - check. I am seeing a therapist to work on my issues including self worth.

Lawyer - I need to look into how to do this, how to pay for one etc.

Support group - I have my family, but they are back in the UK, I have some friends here that are being great. 

I know if I was watching this happen to someone else, I would be telling them exactly what you are telling me. Why is it so hard to accept what is going on, and not be in denial? 




 Thank you.

All of our family are in the UK, we moved to the US two years ago for his job. I have spoken to my side of the family and they are all willing to support us if I move back with the kids. I just really want the kids to be able to finish their school term here, they only have 10 weeks left.

My friends here are aware of what is going on, but one has just flown back to the UK, one is in DC and the other close friend is very supportive, but has her hands full with her own family.

I just need to get my head around what is going on. I know I cannot continue living like this. 




 Thank you.

He is basically an extra child at times. And having two small kids anyway really doesn't make things any easier.

I am still in pain this morning, but he is still way to drunk to be taking care of the kids. If this pain continues, I am going to have to call a friend to have the kids and to drive me to the ER again. I don't know what the ER would be able to do, but at least there I can be monitored etc. Maybe they can find what is causing the pain. 




 I know. It is just so hard not to want things to turn out differently. We have been together for so long, and this has happened so out of the blue, that I think I am still in such denial that it could be over. 

I really wanted to just leave him there last night, but I was worried about him being so drunk and out of it. Also I didn't want the kids finding him passed out in vomit, with vomit all over the house too.

I agree that I really need to put myself first, but it is very hard to do that when you are also considering the kids. I think if I was closer (in distance) to my family, then I would have left him, or at least moved us out already. 




 Just one of the things I am working on with my therapist - self worth issues.  




 Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21za91/i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years_has_just_ended/

So, it has been three days since my last post, and three weeks since he told me that he didn't think he loved me anymore.

Things have been strained to say the least. I am still in a lot of physical pain, but as yet, no one can identify where it is coming from. The next course of action is to check my gallbladder.

He has been very distant since I was taken in to the ER by my OBGYN. When I got out of hospital I was given instructions for bed rest and no exertion, but as soon as I got home, I had to sort out the kids lunches for school the following day, put the kids to bed, get dinner etc. 

On Thursday, his car broke down, so I had to go and collect him from work. He then told me he had invited his works team around to our house on Friday evening (the next day) for a games and drinking night. We have had these nights before, most people bring their kids as we have a big house and the kids can run around and play, watch tv. One out of the couples is DD and as I rarely drink, I am usually another DD?

Anyway, I spent most of Friday getting the house ready, not too much, but wiping down and making sure the kids toys were away. I also had to shop for a leaving present for my youngest childs teacher whos last day it was.

He came home early from work to cook for his friends, I sorted the kids out with dinner and helped him out.

We had a good evening, I tried my best not to show that anything is wrong as he has not told anyone about what is going on at home. The last guests left just after midnight and I tidied up a little, then came up to bed to take my pain meds and to get some sleep. He was very drunk and layed down in the spare room. I asked if he was sleeping in the there and he started asking me why I was being so friendly with him tonight. I told him I was just trying to be nice and to act normally. He asked why I hadn't been that close to him the night before. I reminded him that I had tried to sit with him to watch tv, but he was being an ass and wouldn't move to let me sit near him, so I had gone to bed early that night.

Anyway, he basically passed out on the bed, so I got him a glass of water, covered him up, and came to bed. I took my pain meds and antisickness meds, both which make me drowsy, and fell asleep for a while. I woke about 45 mins later to hear him throwing up. He had made it to the guest bathroom, but had thrown up everywhere. I have a bit of a vomiting issue, but I then stripped the bed, grabbed his clothes and hosed them down and got it all in the wash. Cleaned the matress, remade the bed, cleaned the carpets too. Moved his water into the bathroom and put a bowl next to him too. He was really emotional and crying, I tried to console him and tell him he was ok, but he told me to go away. I made sure he was safe and left him in there. I went back in after 20 mins and he was asleep on the floor in there. I cleaned the toilet bowl, basin and his arms, tried to wake him to get him to the spare room,but he was too out of it for me to do anything. I have made sure he is in his side, plenty of room around him etc. Not the first time I have done this with him. I have put a blanket over him and he can move when he wants. 

So now, I am wide awake, in pain, not able to take any more meds for two hours, and thoroghly confused about what the hell I am supposed to do. 

He complains that I show him affection, he complains if I leave him alone. He wants to be free of responsibility, but can't even look after himself when it comes down to it.

Most of all I am wondering why the hell I have just spent two hours cleaning up after a man who says he no longer loves me, and isn't sure he wants to be with me any more.

TLDR: What the hell is going on here??





**EDIT** So, it is over. He woke up this morning, still drunk. He asked what had happened last night and his only concern was that he might have done something embarrasing in front of his friends.

He came in to our bedroom about half an hour ago and basically blamed me for all his bad feelings against me, why he doesn't love me is all my fault. He was spoiling for a fight but I wouldn't give it to him.

He was completely horrible, and told me that the doctors can't find anything wrong with me so why am I in pain.

I told him that if he felt like that then why didn't he just say it was over. And he did. And then had another go at me telling me that I should go ahead and post it all on Facebook and in here as I had been talking about him anyway (I had told him from the start that I was posting here, and he knows my reddit name so nothing was hidden - I even gave him my throwaway name).

He has lost that last bit of respect I still had for him. I am crushed and devestated, but I have my answer now. 




 I only had the t/v as it was at my OBGNY office. I had the same issue as you last time, when I was layed down all looked normal, when I stood up, everything shifted and the ovary went into tortion. They only worked it out when they did the laproscopy! 




 Thank you.  




 I would have said yes to your last question, but time, pain and not enough sleep is making me doubt everything now. What was real and what was him faking it all? 




 Thank you. What made me most concerned and realizing how ill I actually feel, was when I didn't want a cup of tea! 




 Thank you 




 That is how I thought we were, and still how I feel about him. I am wondering if he ever did care at all...
