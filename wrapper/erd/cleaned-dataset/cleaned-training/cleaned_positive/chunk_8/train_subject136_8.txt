 I know we all circle jerk in here about the benefits but what are some of the downsides.

In my experience...

-increased aggression
-Higher chance of making questionable decisions with women

^^ what I mean is that sometimes I fap and it saves me from calling up a chick that I would later regret sleeping with.
 




 Me too.  I've always thought that nofap was extreme.  But then again I have a high sex drive so if you put a good looking female in front of me I'm going to have no problems getting aroused for her.

I think the people who really need help and need to withdraw a bit are the teens who masturbate like 5 times a day.  That's just crazy.  I might go a few times a week if that. 




 So do you think it's smart to just buy a laptop with a touchscreen and Windows 8 (assuming the price is the same) then?

I've just heard a lot of bad things about Windows 8... how it was a failure and MS sees it like it saw Vista.  HP's recent announcement that they're going back to Windows 7 on some of their new models had me worried as well.

I'm also hoping these touchscreens aren't a gimmick.  I want my laptop to last a while. 




 I guess the main thing is that I'm not looking for a touchscreen computer.  Rather than pay extra for that, I'm looking to buy older and upgrade to today's specs. If possible. 




 I have no interest in Windows 8 at the moment.  I might as well get an older laptop that I can upgrade the hd and RAM on then.

Would prefer portability and battery life over everything else.

 This requires Quinn to be amazingly competent and doesn't fit with his characterization from earlier in the series.  Nice story though. 




 I notice he uses at some crime scenes and not at others. Where can I find more info about the yarn and it's purpose as well? 




 I'm gonna try this.  Enjoy the gold! 




 I don't hate you at all. I made this post for feedback and insight from others.  Thanks you for your kind words.  They weren't harsh at all. 




 lol. Actually this is effective. 




  if she gives vague answers 

Vague answers are all I've ever gotten.  :(

Thanks for the advice. I'll be fine.  I'm certain. 




 Yeah, I used to have the same gripe.  Especially when he was staking out the Mexican gang and literally parked in front of their house.  But then I realized it would be a horrible camera angle to show Dexter 3 blocks away.   




 So you're telling me that there's a higher chance of a Vince Masouka in Miami than a Dexter Morgan??

  is there anything i should be aware of heading into everyone's least favorite season?

lolwut?  Just watch it.  Only thing you need to be aware of (and it seems you already are) is that the quality is so-so.  So temper your expectations. 




 Thanks! 




 We were together for over 5 years and long distance plus trust issues put the nail in the coffin.  Honestly the reasons don't even matter at this point.  I've typed essays about it on the internet before.

I have employed a pretty decent post-breakup strategy over the years.  I hope I didn't give the impression that I'm sulking around everyday depressed about this. lol.  Today was just that random moment where it REALLY gets to me.  It happens about once every two months.   




 I've considered therapy.  How do you go about finding a good one?

We were together for 6 years.  Have had on/off communication over the last two years.  If I knew for a fact reconciliation wasn't a possibility, I would easily get over it.  The problem is that she keeps dangling hope out there.  Like I said, most of the time I'm completely fine.  But today was a down moment. 




 I honestly wouldn't wish this pain on anybody.  I have my good days and my bad days.  Trust me, my good days far outweigh the bad... But here I am at 7AM on a Sunday, awaken from 4 hours of sleep after a night of partying and a dream about her.

It was so real, but alas we are not back together.  We haven't even talked in awhile.  I really hate my scumbag brain.

**tl;dr:  It's two paragraphs cmon!  If that's still too much just read the title. 




 Nobody ever replies in there. 




 The newer smartphones have incredible battery life.  I went from having to charge my phone every 6 hours to once a day.  I love it. 




 Try to find balance OP.  Remember, you can't get that time with your kids back later. 




 Why would you girl want to see this? Seems like a red flag 




 Well to be fair he did shake Roddy White's hand after he was cooked for a TD in last year's playoffs.  I get why people don't like Sherman, but to me he just seems like a trash talker who can also take it if need be.  Unfortunately, there haven't been too many opportunities where people have shut him up ON the field. 




 Just bought them.  Thanks. 




 Just curious. I've been binge watching on Netflix and my brother said to stop watching after season 4.  I just watched the first episode of season 5.  Should I quit now and save myself future anger and headaches?

 




 Congrats but sounds like you replaced one addiction with another. 




 I need to see more! 




 I'm watching Dexter on Xbox 360 and it does it for me.  I noticed it the other night. 




 Thanks for this breakdown.  I think I had a different view of what I perceived to be a sociopath.  Someone who simply isn't driven by the emotions most people feel.  This could lead them to commit crimes or just go about their lives never feeling connected to anybody.

But reading these comments has taught me a lot about both sociopaths (which I agree are not accurately defined) and stoics. 




 I don't think all sociopaths harm others.

 so·ci·o·path
 ˈsōsēōˌpaTH/
 
 1. a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience.

I could imagine some sociopaths simply not caring about the world around them yet not going out of their way to harm others as well. 




 I wasn't even trolling tho.  I thought about it while watching Dexter.  I have now been educated thanks to asking the question and creating this thread. 




 They both seem to be emotionally detached from the events around them and accept things for what they are. 




 Nice.  I wouldn't change anything honestly. 




 Ooh... I like the second one. 




 I always feel obligated to say, "No problem." or "It's cool." so I don't seem petty.  But what should I say if I don't forgive the person? 




 75% of these replies are from non-teachers. 




 I live in the US and so does he. 




 Nice, too bad I'm not in the UK! 




 Why is there a plethora of cats failing at jumping?  Is this a thing? 




 I gotta save this.  I actually busted out laughing. 




 The feelings you're feeling right now are temporary.  This is purely your internal battle with your ego.  You've already admitted that you didn't really want him and the new girl is better.

If you met someone tomorrow to absolve your jealousy/loneliness I promise you wouldn't care about this anymore.   




 But what if you don't have a mission?  




 As someone who has had to work a job where I stood up on my feet all day, I don't think standing is that good for you either.

I was in more pain then than I am now. 




 Semi-related... What about stuff like Red vs. Blue?  They sold dvds and made money using Bungie's game and engine. 




 A pic with your eyes covered would probably help you get the best feedback possible.

 Good idea.  She has a bunch of Penzey's spices in her house already.  Maybe a gift card so I don't buy something she already has? 









 I disagree that the 25th ranked school and 75th are the same.  Cmon now.  I'd rather do online or part-time at a top 25 school than full-time at #75
