 Eh I'm well out of school but I'm seriously considering a service job so you're not at all off there :) 




 Yeah that's been another problem. I've been vigorously applying for the last couple of months now and I haven't gotten as far as an interview yet even though my resume doesn't actually belie the fact that I haven't worked in some time. I worked in a competitive field and even though I do have some really solid experience/recommendations from back when I was working, I haven't gotten any bites yet. Good luck on your search, I hope it gets better for us both soon!
