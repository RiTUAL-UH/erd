 I estimate I have emailed 1700 resumes over the last two years with only 5 interviews. I have been getting the help of a nonprofit organization for the last month to try to find a job. 




 I take Bupropion (Wellbutrin) 300mg. it worked for the first 3 months but is starting to fail. I am highly allergic to every other SSRI so trying different meds has been a 25 year failed experiment.
