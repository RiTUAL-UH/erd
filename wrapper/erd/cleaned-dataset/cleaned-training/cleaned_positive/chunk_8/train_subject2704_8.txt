 I tried that myself made things horrible comfort wise. Though I'm by no means a professional.  




 Hello everyone, I've been thinking about lowering my bike recently. I bought it last March and rode it all summer as it was. (standard height) However that being said. I am 5'2 small female and ride a Kawasaki ZX6R 2008. Its quite tall, I have to tip toe on stopping and sometimes it makes me feel really uncomfortable. I know that lowering a bike will change it geometry and make it different while cornering. But say lowering an 1'-.5' would it make a big difference? Or should the bike just be left in stock suspension. Something I've been thinking about for a while. Considered it all summer while I rode it. Though now its off season and I've been thinking about spring a lot and lowering the bike. So whats this community's general consensus. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!

 No but the right shoulder pad armour on my mage was floating around her body in every cut scene  




 Did you make these or buy them? I was thinking of doing something similar.  




 Sorry but why not have sex instead of fapping?  




 True.  




 Headlights are wrong for a 2008 zx6r. Looks more like an 2005 




 Tick or treating
