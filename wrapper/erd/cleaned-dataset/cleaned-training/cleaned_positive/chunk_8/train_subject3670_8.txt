 I had the same thing (different medication though) where I felt nothing at all and the days were just going by and I didn't feel much, so I dropped the amount I was taking back to what I use to take just so I could feel something but now I feel sad and wouldn't mind feeling nothing at least just for a little bit it doesn't feel like a fun game to play. 




 37.. Time to get help again I guess :/ 




 Wow you've put this really well unfortunately I feel like I can relate, I hope you and everyone else who feels this way can find something, someone to make them feel like they belong. 




 Wow this is so good, I'm so glad I was hitting random and found this sub reddit new subscriber right here xD
