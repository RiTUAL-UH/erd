 I honestly can't point to a specific trigger for why I got depressed. I always had days where I was really sad/down my entire life. Those days somehow slowly turned into multiple consecutive days, then weeks, then a full on depression. I also had miserable coping skills with conflicts/problems which didn't really help. I worried about everything really, my lack of any successful relationship, being a virgin, fucking up my college degree, the people I had dissappointed, the oportunities I had missed, what I could have done different ... pointless worrying really about stuff I should have just accepted. 

I tried therapy twice, once during my 2nd hospital stay, which was helpful for getting a bit more insight into the underlying problems, and then again during the last year, which was absolutely pointless - a lot of talking about my problems and what I could do about them ... I found it rather useless, I always knew what to do and what my issues where, I just didn't manage to actually do what needed to be done.

I told my parents pretty early, but avoided telling them about a lot of the gory details and how bad it really was. My parents were fantastic the whole time ... I told some close friends too, but only very superficial information.
