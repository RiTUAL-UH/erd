 Oh for fuck's sake, man.

I'm not saying anyone is against me, I'm just describing a basic human attribute and how it can guide other human's perceptions; Face it, mate. People value physical attractiveness first and foremost. Why are you having trouble with that? Do you honestly think the way you look has no effect on how people respond to you?

And for every successful 'buttface', there were likely several, equally kind 'buttfaces' who didn't end up happily married. Do you think of them? What about that weird kid every school has that everyone thought would shoot up the place? Or the thousand other undesirables shunned and condescended by people like you, all the while being constantly berated about 'how that one time some random ugly guy got a girlfriend or something', and that 'looks don't matter, only your personality does'. 

Did they all 'suck as people'? 

And you still haven't answered my question, but I will for you: You didn't stay with those unattractive women because for all their 'personality' and everything, you couldn't fathom yourself actually entering into a serious, long-term monogamous relationship with them and went for someone prettier. 

Am I right? 




 No, mate. You gained validation from whatever positive social experiences you had in the past and with said validation, created a sense of self-esteem. You didn't make yourself lucky and successful with women, you were born into it through favourable genetics. 

Of course it comes down to looks with me, have you forgotten the fact that I'm ugly? My life has been determined by the way I look, similar to yours. We're just on different scales of the spectrum; people respond nicely to you because you're good looking, thus granting you self-esteem and validation and thus granting you the illusion of personal achievement whereas people respond negatively to me because I'm ugly, thus destroying self-esteem and giving no validation. Is that so hard to understand?

And how are my views on women disgusting? Because I don't patronise unattractive women by assuming that the physical attractiveness of a potential partner doesn't matter to them?

Also, you didn't answer my previous questions. Did you stay long with any of these 'physically unattractive women'? 




 I wouldn't for the very reason a girl of similar attractiveness to me wouldn't be interested in myself: Unattractive people aren't attracted to unattractive people just because they're unattractive. 




 I'm not a victim. I don't blame my problems on the world, I don't blame anyone for the way I look.  It's just the way it is. Fuck, why is that hard for people to understand? 

It just pisses me off when people who have been spoon-fed social validation through no agency of their own talk to people like me as if the reason I didn't have that crucial foundation necessary for intimate relationships in the future was because 'I didn't try hard enough.'

And of course you respond with anecdotes. Whilst there has been concrete scientific study on phenomena such as the halo effect/ physical attractiveness' role in social interactions, there has been nothing to back up your 'friends who are ugly but married' but your word, likely coloured by a variety of external factors. 

Look, if it makes you feel better about the world then keep believing that people's looks change don't how they are perceived, and that everyone is judged solely on their personality. 




 But you've been with pretty girls.

So you obtained validation from the interactions with them first, yeah? And with said validation you were able to go with some unattractive girls and then think to yourself, " Well, they're not that bad, but at least I've had these encounters with x, y and z, who were all pretty, so I know that I won't only always be with unattractive women." 

Did you stay with these unattractive women long? Did you marry one? Get one pregnant? Of course you didn't.

Face it, mate, we're all shallow animals. You can dress it up as much as you want behind illusions of liking someone's 'personality', but it your shallowness will remain and the halo effect will guide your interactions.

Someone has to die alone, it's only because you're in the average that you don't see that. 




 Well, you haven't actually seen me, so that's a pretty unfounded claim. 
I'm single for a variety of reasons, but my physical unattractiveness is at the top of the list. 




 
That's the dilemma, isn't it mate? To overcome loneliness, I'd have to date someone as unattractive as myself who would also find me unattractive. You reckon that's a good thing? No mutual attraction between intimate partners? 

It sucks, it does. I wish I could not factor someone's physicality into how I interact with them, but I, like everyone here (including those who won't admit it) can't completely dismiss how someone looks.

If you have to ask this question, you clearly haven't experienced what it is like to be unattractive. I, like yourself,like anyone,can't just stop myself from desiring physically beautiful people and start desiring ugly people. Fuck, I wish I could.

And I'd imagine most of those women attractive as myself face this same dilemma. 




 You have to be trolling.

Unfortunately, I don't think he is, this mindset is pretty prevalent among the average populace; if it wasn't some gracious deity, it must've been their own hard, American work ethic! Surely it must've been, right? 

They achieved all of this from the get-go as everyone is born equal, yeah? Except those disabled people, but we can just dismiss them, lock them in institutes and viciously attack any doubts about their miserable lives they have with anecdotes of some friend-of-a-friend who was disabled and banged a hot chick or something, or that dude on T.V who is happy but missing his limbs. 

It's the same with them uglies! You're ugly? You still got two hands, dontcha? At least you ain't as bad as them cripples! Get ta work n you'll be rewarded! What's that? You've worked hard all your life with no reward? Work harder,cunt. 




 Let's be honest with ourselves, big fella-- For every 'successful ancestor' there was at least one non-successful ancestor whose bloodline died with him/her, society is the product of an interplay between those that have and those that don't.

And you should feel better about yourself; people like me exist to pamper your precious self-esteem and allow you to reflect on the fact that 'at least you're not as bad as us.' 

I don't wallow self-pity, I accept my place in the world and I don't delude myself with notions better contemplated by those who were allotted a better roll of the dice. Please don't come in here and patronise those of us on the other end of the bell-curve. 

What do you think I could achieve, being as unattractive as I am? A relationship with someone as unattractive as myself? Someone who would also find me physically unattractive? Would you date someone you found physically unattractive? Of course you wouldn't; no one does. 

Get out of the mindset that you are the sole conductor of your 'destiny'.

P.S I exercise and I eat well, but neither will change my facial aesthetic. My legacy will die with me, but so will yours after a time.  




 Ah yes. You're one of them self-deterministic types, eh? Would you say that to a deformed person? To a cripple? Of course not. 

Well, matey, like how disabled people can't magically make their disabilities disappear, some of us aren't born aesthetically pleasing and no amount of nice hairstyles is going to fix that.

Thank the indifferent, random power of genetics that you weren't born like some of us, leave this sub and don't go thinking your position in life is entirely of your own doing. 

Edit: The fact that these two numpties are being upvoted makes me a worried that this sub might not be for me any longer. 




 Work out, dress well, keep hygienic, wash your face, style your hair.

Heh...  




 To any modders out there,

SE combat needs a little more variety, IMO, and I think the addition of some kind of cruise missile launcher for large ships ( think something like the US MK 143 or a Tomahawk launcher) would be an awesome addition to the fairly limited large ship weapon collection. I'd do it myself but I have no clue as to how to code and have fairly basic modelling skills. 




 Won: Can eat anything and not really get fat.

Lost: Am only 5 ft 7. (fuck you, Italian heritage) 




 Wanna know what combat is like in Starmade?

There is no use for small ships; every ship you see is a gargantuan behemoth with enormous amounts of shields/guns/speed. Combat literally boils down to who can build the biggest ship.That's it. No manoeuvring, no clever building, no engineering custom weapons or ammunition.  And combat is all the game is really about, as you don't have to really worry about basic Newtonian physics/ resources all that much as : 

a. There is no Newtonian physics, and
b. Resources are so incredibly easy to come by ( stations, etc,) and building is as easy as Minecraft.

Meaning you can pretty much focus straight away on attacking other players, not balancing resources/build time like you need to in SE.

Sure, it has infinite worlds and logic implemented, but that's all it has over Space Engineers. 




 Oh, definitely.

The time frame in which I'm writing is set maybe a hundred or so years after the largest revolution known to the world of Wa: Gasin's Revolt ( Or The Fall of the Old Monarchy.

To paraphrase, Gasin was a wealthy merchant living under the reign of the Othenai Emperor in PL 1200 who overthrew the monarchy in 1205. 

Merchants of that time were required to pay support-funds for wars of the realm. The Emperor of that time was engaged in a lengthy war with a smaller state which was draining on the resources of the merchants. Gasin was the first to say, ' Nope, fuck you. I'm out,' and stopped paying his wartax. 

This caused an uproar from the nobility and the Emperor himself, who proceeded to have Gasin arrested. Gasin fled to a neighbouring kingdom and formed a group of like-minded merchants who then convinced the under class to rise up and depose the king. They did so enthusiastically and overran the state's capitol, butchering the Emperor and his entire extended family.

Gasin then took reign of the state, forming a council of other merchants to rule over the bits of land he kept from the collapsing Othenai Empire. Gasin and his Golden Teeth ( a term for both his actual teeth, which were gold, and the council of merchants he assembled) however went back on their promises to the underclass of 'every man has a voice' and instead established an oligarchical company-state called Authon. There was mass unrest again, but Gasin was lucky in that he was able to garner support against the rebellion by classing it as a rebellion of 'radical puritans', blaming the unrest on Authon's minority Axar population and the Church of the Fertile Womb. In doing so, Gasin turned the hatred felt by the multi-cultural underclass towards a single group of people long thought of as devious and insular, and avoided he himself being deposed. 

Such was the work of Gasin Golden-Teeth, First High-Chairman of Authon. 




 People call any rioters animals and thugs, regardless of their skin-colour.

One example quoting Britain's youth as being called the 'most unpleasant and potentially violent young people in the world': http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2024486/UK-RIOTS-2011-British-youths-unpleasant-violent-world.html

People rioting and looting are cunts, whether they be black, white or brown cunts still doesn't change the fact that they are being violent and anti-social.
 




 From the great expanses of tundra of Northern Othen to the moutainous heart of Firlon, the remains of Pre-Light society abound within Wa.

Most prominent of these could be considered wonders, for they are indeed marvellous creations of ancient technological prowess and still puts to shame much of what Post-Light civilisation has built. 

I'll describe two wonders here: one Pre-Light and one Post-Light

**The Mai Space Elevator:** Forever a mystery, the Mai Space Elevator ( or The Finger of Cotmiv, depending on who you talk to) remains the most intact Pre-Light building of the known world. Lying a few kilometres from the city of Mai, its condition is so well-preserved that is it rumoured to still reach space, possibly even connected to some other ancient structure in the distant heavens. 

However such speculations will remain  mystery as the elevator has been held tightly under the thumb of the Atcotmivrosht, the followers of Cotmiv, who deny all entry to the elevator on the grounds of it being a place not to be seen by mortal eyes, and their presence amongt Mai's senior council has made any possibility of exploration improbable. So the Mai Elevator remains untouched, gargantuan and eery as it towers above the hills of Central Othen, visible to the eye for hundreds of kilometers.

**The Pious Walk:**  An enormous procession of huge kneeling statues carved around 800PL, the Pious Walk is perhaps the most well-known wonder of Firlon. Each statue is said to represent some long-dead Huisa monarch, in total  numbering around 450 statues, all in various states of decay. The Pious Walk leads right to the old city gates of Ntua, ending it the unfinished statue of the most recent monarch, Boja the Seventeenth, who was beheaded during the fall of the Huisa regime in 1213 PL. 




 Dunno what Jackal is, really. 

He just appeared one day and told me he'd stay for good. When I was little, he got me to break the spines of my sister's mouse which was pretty hilarious! I gave the mouse to him afterwards and he put it on his shoulder and said he was Blackbeard and now the mouse is still on there but it's teeth are really long now and I sometimes wake up to find it rolling around on my face,haha. The teeth scratch me sometimes.  




 Well, Benny said he saw him. 

But Benny also eats the lead paint from the metal balustrade on his balcony.

My brother said he used to have the same dreams as I did at our old house in Haberfield when we were little but I don't think he's seen Ol' Mate since then. 




 Oh, I thought it was Gina, Piero and Bruce. 




 Hey guys, greetings from Australia: the land of VB, utes and wilful ignorance. 

Bit of a weird title,sorry, but I guess I had to try and grab someone's attention with pure, exploitative bluntness. 

Ol' mate Jackal's wearing my skin.

Well, not actually wearing my skin physically (at least I don't think so), but he's certainly not just in his own fur now. It's kinda strange as well because I thought he'd gotten used to me getting used to his worm-hair stuff ( Whatever the fuck it is; it's not really like worms, though-- more like thin seaweed caught in a tough current while it's still rooted to the rocks. Weird how it just floats like that.)

Anyway, I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions as to what I should do. I've tried asking him to stop wearing my likeness, but he talks too quickly. Always has. Sounds kind of like if you got three people and a goat and pumped them full of helium and then compressed them flat, letting out all the helium in one big rush. So a mixture of high-pitched animal/human squeals? Kinda hilarious sometimes. It hurts to listen other times.

I mean, I've known him since I was six, but this is the first time he's actually changed appearance. 

What should I do?

 




 B-but I have to fight the Dark One! *[looks off moodily into the distance]* 




 Hey guys. I've been following the CGCookie tutorial on creating a Low-poly mesh for game design and I've run into some trouble. 

After rearranging the UVs and preparing to bake the normals, a weird circle that only appears in object mode appeared at the base of my mesh. Seen [here](http://imgur.com/a4XMp9e)

I also believe that this mystery circle is screwing up my normal bake and causing it to look like [this](http://imgur.com/Z6iUd7I). Also in that picture you can see that the origin of the low-poly has somehow changed, so to bake I have to manually move it closer to the high-poly.

I've tried recalculating the normals, flipping the normals, etc, but nothing works.

Have I accidentally hit a button that I shouldn't have? 




 :(^^^^^why ^^^^^did ^^^^^I  ^^^^^click? 




 This was shot on the coast? 

Yeah, you don't wanna live there. 




 Not to seem rude, but where'd you get your source on the 25% statistic? 




 I'd imagine some in the East also wanted to revolt against Kiev but no one really acknowledges that they had any real grievance and just attributes it to Russian involvement.

But I see your point. Russia did play upon Eastern Ukraine's frustrations and encouraged them to revolt whereas the American colonists revolted independently. 




 My Axolotl and I: An erotic love story. 




 Yeah but without the French the Revolution wouldn't have gotten anywhere. You could argue the same thing in Eastern Ukraine: A small amount of Eastern Ukrainians were legitimately angry with the Kiev revolt and decided to revolt themselves. Russia took advantage of the situation and poured forth supplies and manpower into the rebels.

A lot of Western media seems to portray the Eastern Ukrainians as never actually wanting to secede and that the Russians basically manufactured all of the dissent, but I doubt the Russians would've had so much success in escalating the conflict if there hadn't been at least some grievance amongst the local population. 




 People tend to forget that the American Revolutionaries were also helped considerably by the French.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War

When you think about it, the scenarios are actually quite similar. 




 LIES! I've posted my pictures and I'm not attractive. I think I'm just one of the few ugly guys brave ( or stupid) enough to do it.

 Sorry,replied to the wrong guy. 




 I don't particularly give two shits if you don't think it's true or not. 

It was a story told to me by my dad, not to you; I just thought I'd share it, but you know...yadda yadda circlejerk/hivemind, etc. 

Next time try not to get all pissy because of the anecdote of some guy on the internet's father.

 




 The Aboriginal Languages of Australia.

Some of the most interesting and unique of the world's languages are found here (one of the world's only tripartite languages is found in Northern Australia), but one by one they are dying out. 




 I think production was around 1998. 

Yeah, all he messed up the caravan and the wardrobe, so my dad was called in to fix it. This story was more anecdote than criticism against Keanu. Just thought it'd give more insight into the fact that actors aren't these God-men that a lot of people think they are.

As I said, my dad's a pretty vocal guy and he was just swearing out loud to himself at having to fix something that someone messed up. He didn't know it was Keanu that had done it, nor did he know Keanu was inside.

Guess this isn't the thread to post the story in.   




 What? You can't call someone out on their behaviour? Is it because he's a celebrity? He didn't straight out say it to Keanu's face, he was just generally cursing as he had to take time out of his shift to go fix a wardrobe because someone had kicked it in in a fit of anger. He didn't know Keanu was there. 




 The guy wrecked the caravan that had been given to him, my dad had every right to call him a fuckwit. It was the film set's property and Keanu chucked a hissy fit because he though the Matrix was going to be a flop.  




 My dad worked on the set of The Matrix and has a few stories to tell about his experience there. Apparently, Keanu wasn't as nice as people today think him to be. 

According to my dad, Keanu made a general mess of his caravan in a fit of anger and my dad was called over to fix the wardrobe. My dad, being the verbal kind of guy he is, expelled a variety of obscenities, some along the lines of, "What fuckwit did this?" 

Much to my father's chagrin, the perpetrator of such fuckwitry was no other than Keanu Reeves himself who had still been residing within the caravan. On hearing my father's exclamation, ol' mate Keanu exited the caravan in a huff, but before he left he kicked in the door, turning to my dad and saying something like, "Something else for you to fix."

Probably left out some details as I haven't heard my dad tell the story for a long, long time, but that's the general gist of it.

 Top of the list would be The Illumination ( The Light of Toruzh, The Judgement, etc.) 

Two or three thousand years prior to when my story is set, the civilisations of Wa had reached a technological golden age. A number of space elevators had been constructed, transhumanism was the norm and Wa had finally established a equilibrium with its environment.

However, the sun Toruzh ( thought to be the eye of the God Toruzh by Eastern Othenai tradition) emitted a powerful solar flare that rendered most of the technologies created by man worthless and plunged them into a dark age lasting around 450-500 years. Countless hundred of millions died from starvation, disease and exposure as their machines ceased to save them from Wa's harsher aspects. Along with their technologies went all recorded data not written down, leaving the inhabitants of Wa still wondering to this day at what life may have been like for Pre-Light folk. 



*'Yes,
how can man see after such brightness?
What value does the light of hope have compared
to such beauty?'*

 -Author unknown. Pre-Light Era. 




 Contemporary armies of Wa make heavy use of projectile based weaponry. 

E.g. The Military Arm of the Authon Corporation equips its average soldier with a repeater. Repeaters are side-loaded, semi-automatic rifle-esque weapons that use a mixture of compressed air and magnetism to project small shards of metal. Due to the method of propulsion, projectiles from repeaters have a small range of fire, and thus regular soldiers are extremely dependant on artillery ( both static and mobile), exosuits, and melee.

Most heavier vehicles are equipped with larger version of said repeaters ( like the Monk-class MK.1 exosuit which uses dual heavy repeaters), or long-guns that fire a wide variety of spear-like projectiles. Other types of vehicles (land and air) also carry dumb-missiles, bombs or flamethrowers)

Artillery in Wa use traditional, Pre-Light powder-based munitions. Powder-based weapons are rare outside of artillery due to the rarity of saltpeter. That doesn't stop the armies of Wa from blasting the ever-living fuck out of each other with countless tonnes of explosive artillery rounds however. No one know how much saltpeter is left in the world, but it is used solely for military products.
