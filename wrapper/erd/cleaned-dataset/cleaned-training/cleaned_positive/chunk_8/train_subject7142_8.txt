 As strange as it seems regarding his current behaviour,he used to be really nice and open-minded before he knew haha 




 Yeah,you're right,I think this it what I have to do. I gave him a chance to stop being an ass and he blew it so I think that's the only way. Makes me sad still because we've known each other for like four years :/ 




 The things I know would help me are just people showing a bit of care,open-mindedness and understanding. Them actually be there not only when they need something out of me. A world where you don't have to brag about your achievements to feel like you exist but that's a bit too much to ask,maybe.

Is there really nothing you can think of that could help you,too ? :) 




 So,you could try to spend a some time alone with her,make sure the moment is really nice,conflicts-free and tell her. This is what I did to come out to my own mom,it took mad courage to say the words but I felt so much better afterwards. If she doesn't react very well,I'd recommand you to bring back the subject later but to always be there to answer her interrogations if she has some,sometimes a "not-so-good reaction" is just people failing to understand.

If this is not an option,you might want to write her a letter. Also,remember that you have time to come out,you don't have to rush it. Only do it if you feel fully prepared to do so. :)

Look,if you are in fact a girl and pursuing it would make you happy,go for it without shame ! Life really is too short to do things you don't want to do,pretend and stuff just because of a biological sex. From someone who tried reaaally hard to "be a girl" only to please everyone ( I'm FtM ) and ended up miserable,I mean it. :)
