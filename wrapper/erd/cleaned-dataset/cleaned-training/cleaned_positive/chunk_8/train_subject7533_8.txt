 My short term memory is pretty much shot, which seems to be a symptom of long-term isolation :( I'm pretty incapable of learning a foreign language. Tried French, Japanese, and German. 

I was a teaching assistant in my college's capstone course, so it's not like I suffer from debilitating social anxiety or am unable to be around people. I have problems with sensory overload (fuck clocks - hence tick tock tick tock), but a classroom setting is usually quiet enough for me to function. 

I wanted to go somewhere like Micronesia and volunteer teaching English (their primary language), but no moneys/passport.
