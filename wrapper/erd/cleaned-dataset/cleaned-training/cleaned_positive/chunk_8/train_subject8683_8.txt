 I've had her for about 6 months (she belonged to my ex-roommate and/or his mom for a couple of years), and sometimes when I bend down to pet her, she runs and hides (and sometimes she doesn't and just lets me pet her).

She likes to snuggle next to me when we both sleep at night, and she climbs on top of me when she wants affection.

I do know that she doesn't like to be picked up though, but sometimes I have to. She'll thrash around and make noise when I pick her up, and I'm not sure if I'm hurting her or she just doesn't like it.

Other than that, I never hurt her on purpose (not even as punishment for doing something bad like I know some pet owners do), I make sure her litter box is clean, I feed her and give her water (and even share my own food with her sometimes), and like I said, I let her sleep next to me even though she has her own bed and it restricts my movement when she's in the bed with me.

Is me picking her up sometimes the reason she runs away from me sometimes? 




  How exactly does it affect you?

 What's so weird about it?

I don't know, it just feels... different. I guess because I'm used to seeing the character take one step after another when I move them, instead of floating. Maybe they feel lighter than characters who walk.

I also noticed that with Zod, the way he walks makes him feel heavier when I use him, which also feels weird to me.

Like I said, it might be something I could get used to, and tbh, I do appreciate the fact that different characters all have different stances, even to the extent that some don't even touch the ground (although it might be cool if you could choose to float or walk as Superman or something, since he doesn't levitate everywhere in the comics/films). 




 In *Injustice*, Superman, Green Lantern, and I think a couple of other characters don't stand-- they float roughly two inches off the ground and glide when you move.

Is it me, or does that just feel extremely weird? Is it something one can eventually get used to? 




 -top of ladder reads "THIS IS NOT A STEP"-

-Calvin immediately decides that he *will* use it as a step- 




 In [one strip](http://assets.amuniversal.com/07d60d60df8e01317256005056a9545d) Calvin claims that Hobbes cleans himself by licking his fur, which is very true about most, if not all cats.

Now, Calvin is obsessed with dinosaurs and has amazingly thorough knowledge of them, but he never exhibits real interest in any other animals (except [snakes in one strip](http://assets.amuniversal.com/ebd6bec0784d01302116001dd8b71c47), and [wasps/spiders in another](http://assets.amuniversal.com/d295bca0deca013171a6005056a9545d)). We also know [Calvin hates school because "[We] don't read about dinosaurs."](http://assets.amuniversal.com/541c1540decb013171a6005056a9545d)

So how would Calvin know that cats lick themselves clean unless he's *really* seen Hobbes do it? And if Hobbes isn't real, how does Calvin know about all the other true cat/tiger habits that he imagines Hobbes having? 




 Believe me, the cavalcade of downvotes has made that point crystal clear. 




 I agree. That was more or less my point. Millions of people follow a religion whose holy book advocates slavery, stoning children, sexism, and condemns homosexuality, long hair, etc.

It might offend a homosexual that so many people follow a religion that says they should be put to death for not being heterosexual.

 Buddha was definitely a real person. Mohammed, I'm not sure.

It's like I told another user-- we disagree. No reason to bicker about it. 




 Cool, then we're both happy.

 You don't like using "boyfriend/girlfriend" the majority of the time? 




 We disagree on the level of believability amongst various entities.

Also, the reason I specified what I said is because you said:

**Does that make his version of religion more believable than any other?** 




 I'd rather be a moron than someone who tries to bully people over the internet.

By the way, I still love you. You're just on your period. 




 We disagree. Live and let live. 




 I *really* don't feel like looking up information regarding Jesus' existence, but the point is, I didn't say Christianity was more believable than ANY other religion. I said it's more believable than Norse mythology. 




  am good to my partner

Serious question, and no offense meant at all-- are you a homosexual? If so, how do you feel about what the Bible says regarding homosexuality? 




 Whatever the case may be, semantics aside, saying that one "knows" Hell is real or isn't real is incorrect. 




 Well, and I'm not positive, but I do believe that most historians are of the belief that Jesus was a real person.

Son of God? Jury's out. 




 Back of the line. No cutsies! 




 The fact that bears don't fly, talk, know how to use salt or what salt is, wear tutus, or travel in packs numbering 100,000. 




 Good question. Some people would say he's not, since he punishes the bad people of the world. Others would say that he defied God, so he's undeniably evil.

Hard to say. 




 I like this post. Very eloquent. 




 That it's a lot less likely than Hell existing. 




 You're right; I could be wrong about that. 




 I'm basing this on what the Bible says as far as I'm aware. 




 I referred to that possibility in the body of the thread. 




 I believe that's what the Bible says. 




 This is interesting.

Please elaborate. 




  There is no (none, zilch, zero, nil) possibility of going to hell. So why think about it?

You can't say that. Nobody knows either way. Knowing means you have irrefutable proof. Neither side does. 




 The thing about Norse mythology is that it's a lot less believable than Christianity, which is saying a lot. 




 You don't think Adolf Hitler was possibly like that? He's the first person I thought of when bringing up the evil overlord problem. 




  It's as feasible as going to hell, maybe more feasible since we know sharks exist and mutations happen. 

_ In all fairness, mutations in nature happen mostly for a reason. Sharks having legs wouldn't give them a better chance at survival, sustenance, and reproduction (the only three things that wild animals care about) than they have now. 




  In short it really doesn't bother me. Why should it?

I'm not saying it should or shouldn't. 




 Plot twist: I *do* end up dying gloriously in combat.

In seriousness: Like I said, Atheists tend to stick to their beliefs very strongly. But you'd be a liar if you said fear of the unknown isn't one of man's most significant.

The "unknown" being, despite what anyone in this thread says, no one KNOWS if Hell is real or not. 




 It's not fiction, but it makes sense in fiction for a reason. People who are evil are generally less moral to a tremendous extent. To the extent that they will kill/torture people, enemy or ally, for the pettiest of reasons.

Didn't hold the door open for the evil overlord? Dead.

Mispronounced a word while speaking of your reverence for the evil overlord? Dead.

Hesitated slightly before killing an unarmed enemy in cold blood? D-E-A-D, *DEAD*. 




 I don't think Pascal's Wager quite fits here. That's simply believing in something because you fear the consequences of not doing so as well as the lack of benefits of not believing. That'd be kind the equivalent of someone reading this thread, saying "Oh crap, it would fuckin SUCK to go to Hell," and converting to Christianity.

I assume most Atheists have more pride and strength of belief than to do something like that. I'm asking those people, who will stick to their belief that NO deity exists, if they've ever thought about being wrong.

Sort of like asking someone who's a police officer, and a very good one, "Do you ever fear getting gunned down by an armed criminal?" They're not going to quit the force just because that's a possibility, but the concern can still be there. 




 Haven't you ever seen an evil overlord in a almost any work of fiction? You don't want to be on their side because they'll win, because they'll also treat you like shit. _

See: Visser Three, *Animorphs* 




 I'm not sure it's possible to be indifferent about spending eternity in any version of Hell. That would be like being indifferent about being forced to watch all your friends and family get gunned down, then have their corpses raped and eaten. 




 lol, I don't think *you* understand what Atheism is. Atheism is a *belief*. You don't *know*. You *think*. 




 The point of this thread is basically "What if you're wrong?" 




 Granted, with all the different religions in the world, and the fact that a person can only choose one, Atheists have as much a (statistical) chance of going to Christian Hell as Christians have of going to Jahannam (the Islamic Hell), and so on. Only one religion can be "right." That said, I'm an Atheist as well, so please don't think I'm criticizing your beliefs, or anyone else's for that matter.

Regardless, what are our resident Atheists' feelings on the potential of eternal damnation? 




 Ba dum chh 




 What if certain types of fish are harmful to them? And you just happen to catch that type of fish. Totally coincidentally. 




 Plot twist: Morose_Pundit wins and is declared king. 




 They significantly outnumber you, and you're a potentially hostile invader. You'd be dead, at the very latest, the first time you go to sleep. 









 I meant more along the lines of someone saying "Oh, that's not a poisonous snake" or something. 




 This I can live with.

Although at the same time, this was initially about The Authority trying to push a Plan B to the top of the food chain, which seems counterintuitive to the fact that Daniel Bryan (resident B+ player) defeated all of the active members of Evolution at WrestleMania, with an injured arm, to win the world championship. 




  Randy Orton was in Triple H's vision, but couldn't get the job done.

Exactly. So think about it from Rollins' perspective. He was placed as a lower priority than someone who couldn't get the job done, as you said. Triple H thought more highly of Orton than Rollins, and Orton was a failure. 









  A Plan B might be traditionally less glamorous but is ultimately more effective and reliable than what came before it.

Then why wouldn't you use it first? 




 And how is Plan B better than Plan A? If Plan B was better than Plan A, it would *be* Plan A. 




 If a girl told you that you were her Plan B, how would you feel about that? 




 Being someone's Plan B isn't something to be proud of. You're just something they settled for because their original goals didn't transpire and they needed something to turn to in a time of desperation.

You're not what they really wanted-- you're more like "Whatever. I guess that's good enough." Like going to the store to get two-ply toilet paper, but they only have one-ply. 




 Actually, there are more ways to be poisoned than by eating something poisonous. You can't eat gas.

It's that simple. 




 Hmm. Good info.

Apparently, at least according to Wikipedia, those snakes that you mentioned would qualify as being poisonous. So I guess when people say "poisonous snake," they're technically not wrong, but still probably don't think the word means what it actually means. 




 I know that "poisonous" means that, as far as I'm aware, it's harmful if touched or ingested, and "venomous" is used to describe an animal who has to inject the venom into its prey.

But is venom not a poison, at least technically speaking? If not, why not?

I just randomly thought of this, and I have no idea if I'm even close to being right, or if I'm completely off. 




 I'm sure you know that everything in the world, no matter how good for you, is capable of being consumed to an excessive extent.

You never worry about that? There is such a thing as drinking too much water. 




  I was under the impression that the term 'siren' only developed a connotation for a 'loud and unpleasant wailing sound' in modern times.

Yeah, I'd say that's accurate. But I assume when the word acquired that contemporary definition, it wasn't a coincidence that it was also the name of the seductresses of Greek mythology. The word *had* to be named after them... right? 




 One produces a sound that was so beautiful it could seduce almost anyone who heard it.

The other makes you want to cover your ears if it's going off too close to you.

Why do they have the same name? 




 I'm gonna try this, but in theory, I feel like the jumping jacks would just make me more tired. 




 I work from home, and I don't sleep well for the most part (I have insomnia and completely rely on sleep aids, and they tend not to give you a good night's rest, which results in fatigue a few hours after waking up), so at some point during the day, I usually get a little tired and have the urge to just crawl into bed and finish my work later (which I could do, but staying awake and doing it right then would be better).

Any advice? Even when I go sit at the kitchen table to get away from my bed, and hopefully the urge to lay down, I still feel the urge to put my head down and just fall asleep. It's very inconvenient.

By the way, I have talked to my physician about this. She recommended that I attempt to provide my body with a consistent circadian rhythm, which I'm working on. But for now, I figured I'd look for a short-term solution while I do so.

Thanks. 




 I'm trying to watch videos on NBA.com, and the way certain videos work is that you click a link, and a little mini-window will pop up where you can watch the video(s) you selected. If you click [this link](http://on.nba.com/1AaNcJZ), I believe it should show you exactly what I just described.

When I do that, and the video tries to load, it never does, and I just get a blank screen (but I can hear the audio). But if I right-click on one of the thumbnails of the videos on the right side of the mini-window, and select "Open in new tab/window," I can see the video just fine.

It's a minor inconvenience, but does anyone know what the issue might be? I've tested this in the other internet browsers I have, too, and it's only Firefox that has this problem. 




 I've done *both*. My dad is unwaveringly hard-headed and doesn't listen to any logic except his own, and my step-mother is being a hypocrite-- she was in an auto accident, and she takes morphine for the pain from the surgery that was required on her neck.

She also told me a story about how one of her friend's sons was smoking marijuana with a group of guys, and it was laced with crystal meth or something or another, which has absolutely nothing to do with my situation. That's an instance of smoking with people you don't know and/or who aren't trustworthy. No relation at all to me drinking a half a bottle of alcopop every other day or so.

I'm drinking *Smirnoff Ice*. It barely even qualifies as an alcoholic beverage. It's almost glorified soda. 




 My sister is pretty much a drunk, but I've always been introverted, literally (as in staying in the house) and socially (not indulging in the vices of most people in my age group).

All I did was mention that I've been drinking a little, and they damn near leapt from their seats, without knowing what I drink, how often I drink, and what other controlled substances (only small doses of prescription medications), if any, that I use.

And once again, they basically gave me the "lalalalala icanthearyou" argument when I explained that my physician said drinking in moderation is fine. 




 How does the title imply that the two are being used together? 




 Then what should someone do instead? 




 There is a middle ground, you know. 




 Both have the potential for addiction/dependency, as well as tolerance, and can be incredibly dangerous if taken in large doses. However, if taken in moderation, neither of them is very self-threatening. In the case of alcohol, it's also legal (for those of at least minimum drinking age), just like morphine and other opioids or benzodiazepines.

The only difference I can see is that one requires a prescription and the other does not.

The reason I ask is because I, at *25 years old*, living on my own, told my dad and my step-mother that I've been drinking a little bit on a recent car trip, and they treated me like I was some sort of stupid, hopeless alcoholic. And they didn't believe me when I said my physician, seeing as she considers me intelligent and responsible, told me that drinking in moderation would be fine.

On top of that, all I drink is alcopops (Smirnoff Ice, which is like 4.5% ABV-- that's approximately 9 proof, which is incredibly low for an alcoholic beverage), and I hardly ever drink even a half a bottle (750mL) in one sitting, and I *never* drink more than once a day.

I don't get it. 




 Some girl from halfway across the country sent me a friend request, because she was "looking threw (not a typo on my end) facebook and found my profile and fell in love with my eyes."

I'm not taking her seriously at all-- I'm just waiting for her to do or say something that will 100% confirm that she's a bot or a scammer. She actually sent me a couple voice messages on Facebook and we've talked on the phone. Her voice sounded almost exactly the same in each context. I gave her my cell phone number (it's not a smart phone; there's no information about me on it).

Regardless, here's a list of things she's done/hasn't done that makes me way beyond skeptical:

* Told me her first name was one thing, but her first name is listed as another on her info page
* Claims she works with kids, mainly in the "activity area"... but she tells me she doesn't get off of work until midnight at the earliest and 3 AM at the latest. What could she possibly be doing that involves kids at anywhere near that time of night?
* Posted a status about how her friend was at her house at 10:45 or so the other day, even though she told me she was at work

And, like I said in the title, whether via cell or Facebook, she has not once sent the first message of a conversation in all of at least 7 or 8 conversations, despite all the "OMG I like you so much, you're so cute, I'll text you in the morning," etc (all of which I roll my eyes at). It's like I have to "activate" her by sending a message.

Is that an issue with bots? Also, what else should I look for? 




  literally designed to be thrown long distances efficiently

If, and only if, thrown with proper technique. What are the odds that someone who's never played football can throw with good enough form to maximize the football's aerodynamic capabilities? 




 Assume this athlete hasn't played any sport, which involves throwing a ball, at any credible level. He just has a strong arm and minimal technique. Also assume that his hands are large enough to palm the basketball.

Which is he more likely to throw further? The basketball or the football? And why? 




  And do you think it's just a coincidence that once Montana left his backup just happened to be nearly as awesome? 

Montana also thrived in a totally new system, as an old man. And there's almost no way you can truthfully say Steve Young was near Montana's level. 




 Well, in football, I'm almost positive that the consensus is that quarterback is the most "important" position, which is why Montana is considered by a lot of people to be the NFL GOAT. 




 Not to disrespect your opinion, but I don't think Barry Sanders is even considered the best running back of all time. Somewhat short career and leads the NFL all-time in runs for losses IIRC. 




 Doesn't the fact that Jim Brown retired so early hurt his case? I'm not too big on NFL history (I know a little bit)-- this is what I've heard. 









 I was told by the mods it was okay to post this thread. 




  Those are obviously office and cell phone numbers including area code.

My intelligence is bad and I should feel bad :-( 




 I received a PM on here asking to do a phone interview for Dr. Drew's news show tonight. I have no way of knowing whether or not this is real, as I'm not very savvy in this area.

The only thing I can think of that might help is the fact that he left a series of two ten-digit numbers, labeled "O:" and "C:" respectively. I have no idea what they mean, however. Maybe they're phone numbers-- "Office" and "Cell"?

Also, should I expect payment for this? I'm guessing not, but I figured it was worth asking.

Any advice? Thanks. 




 "Going down the list" as in doing so and looking for anything that resembles "Cloud Scout"? 




 Searched "Cloud" and got nothin. :-/ 




  AutoRuns and remove any unknown or malicious entries

How do I know what might be something harmful that I'd want to remove? Also, a lot of stuff looks unfamiliar to me, but it looks as if it's a key Windows component and I don't want to break my OS by deleting something I need because I didn't recognize it-- I'm not very savvy in this area. 




  reset internet explore, firefox and chrome settings. 

This was also suggestion I came across, but I have a bunch of add-ons for Firefox and I didn't want to have to go through the trouble of remembering them all and then re-downloading them. 




 Do you know if any of those programs will initiate a mandatory computer restart? I scanned one of my 2-TB external hard drives with a duplicate file finder earlier and it took forever, so I don't want the computer to restart automatically since I'm not doing going through the files. 




 http://i.imgur.com/wjgbEUz.png

I've used search engines to find any solutions I could, but I tried at least 5 or 6 of them and they all involved either a program that cost money, or a program that couldn't detect the adware.

Some sites suggested simply using Windows' "Programs and Features" to uninstall it (and even showed screenshots of "Cloud Scout" being listed in their Programs and Features screen), but it's not showing up in mine.

I searched the entire computer for anything under "Cloud" and nothing showed up.

Any suggestions? Thanks. 




  I've seen Kuma with a goddamn Lincoln wig. A BEAR WITH A LINCOLN WIG. I do not want to see stupid inanity like that ever again.

Tekken has a boxing kangaroo, a dinosaur, and a dummy made out of wood that has come to life (and, somehow, a "female" equivalent).

That's pretty inane in my opinion. 




 I've seen some pretty bad character customization in Tekken Tag 2 Ghost Battles 




 It is, but it would be up to the user as to whether or not he wants to deviate from the character's established outfit. Ken and Ryu have arguably the most well-known outfits in fighting game history (gi with no footwear), but if someone wants to change that and give them, say, a more ninja-esque costume (yes, I know they're not ninja) because they think it looks cool, no harm, right?

Also, a lot of really iconic characters don't have truly distinct outfits. Scorpion and Sub-Zero's costumes change from game to game, with the only similarity being that Scorpion wears yellow and Sub-Zero wears blue. They don't really have any one outfit that you can picture and say "That's Scorpion's/Sub-Zero's costume." 




 The ability to change what a character wears, from the colors to the style to an entirely new outfit. 




 Ah, so they can't stop themselves from attacking and they're pretty much screwed? 




 Speaking of that move that Deadpool has in UMvC3, I always wondered this... it's a counter move as far as I know, which means your opponent has to attack you for it to activate. But why would anyone attack Deadpool once they see him power up for the move? Isn't it 100% inevitable that your attack will result in you getting clobbered by Deadpool's life bar? 




 Oh, here's one-- it's not really a tactical advantage, but I'd be surprised if anyone other than Deadpool can *literally* use his life bar as a physical weapon. 




 I was thinking about Steve Fox, and how instead of kicks, he has dodges and sidesteps in his moveset. I find him to be one of my favorite (probably my very favorite) character to use in any fighter because of the fact that no other character (that I've seen) has this trait.

Obviously, if you're playing a 3D fighter, you could always simply sidestep into the foreground or background, but I think it's different with Steve. His evasion moves can make for some pretty badass defensive sequences and can make the user think about his strategy differently than he would with most other characters.

What other characters are unique or have special attributes that few others have? 




 You're right, that was worded poorly. I apologize.

So, how much of the reputation of pitchers being poor hitters is because of the reasons you just explained (tiring oneself out by throwing so many pitches), as opposed to pitchers just not being good hitters for seemingly no good reason (similar to how quarterbacks are known to be fragile and not able to take hits like other offensive players, and big men in basketball are known to be poor free-throw shooters)?

How many full-time pitchers in the history of the majors have been halfway decent power hitters as well? 




 [Beware](http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/)

O_O Oh, flippity flop, sweet holy Moses on a circus wire, YES. 




 Speaking of Babe Ruth, and this is completely off-topic (sorry), but why was he so much more successful as a hitter when he wasn't also pitching? IIRC (and there's a good chance I don't, since I don't follow baseball-- I just know how it's played and stuff), there were few, if any, seasons in which he was a pitcher and also hit a shitload of home runs.

Is there a reason for that or am I just completely off? 




 The best part is Paige smiling after Natalya throws her off. She apparently likes her women to resist. Makes for a challenge. :-) 




 And she doesn't even bother to thread her belt through all the loops.

She's such a rebel. 3 




 Or hell, if that's never been done, has anyone broken the same record twice, period, in their career?

I know Peyton Manning broke the single-season touchdown record twice, first with 49 in 2004 and then 55 in 2013. 









 Hey, say what you want, but I'm not the one going around licking people. 









 Ow, the downvotes. That's what I get for trying to avoid alcohol dependency _ 




 I didn't mean to offend you or even make you feel like I was "correcting" you. I'm just relaying what I was told by a medical professional. That's all.

I meant no disrespect whatsoever. 




  Whatever else you enjoy, do it and bring a friend along to share it with.

Yeah, I've been doing this all day. I'm trying to do anything I can to resist reaching for the other half of that bottle. So far, so good.

**EDIT:** Also, for the record, I did drink last night because of depression. That's why I'm so wary of this cycle. 




 Only certain prescription medications that I take that would be considered "controlled substances." 




 I asked my family physician the same thing, and she assured me that "depressant" and "depression" are related in medical terminology. It's why, according to her, prescription medications like Klonopin (which is a depressant used to treat anxiety) aren't recommended for long-term use, because they will eventually cause depression due to *being* a depressant. 




  One alcopop isn't nearly enough to elicit that kind of response.

But alcoholism has to *start* with that first drink.

**EDIT:** Also, right, I definitely realize and agree that this is a real thing. Which is why I want to avoid it. I'm trying to be as proactive as possible in keeping myself from being one of those people-- you're talking to a guy who had his *very first* alcoholic beverage last night (I'm 25 years old). 




 And the vicious cycle I'm referring to is this:

A person drinks to get over depression. (S)he consumes enough alcohol that the next day, they feel depressed, even perhaps when he or she normally doesn't, so he/she drinks more alcohol to get over the depression.

The next day, more depression, more alcohol.

Then more depression caused by more alcohol, and more alcohol caused by more depression.

Is this a completely unavoidable situation?

I'll be completely honest as to why I'm asking-- I'm an inexperienced drinker and last night I bought a bottle of Smirnoff Ice (1 pint 6 oz or 650mL, only like 4.5% ABV) and drank about half of it. Made me feel kinda good, but I wasn't drunk or even close to it. Just buzzed, and barely tbqh.

Then today, I'm kinda bleh (no hangover, no headache, just kinda low). So my first instinct-- "Maybe I should have a drink again."

But then I fear that the cycle I described above might start. Am I always going to feel depressed the next day every time I get buzzed? Or is there a way to keep that from happening? 




 I've heard arguments from both sides about second-hand smoke. Any sources? 




 Has anyone had success earning on this site outside of using a smartphone to download apps/play games?

I'm partial to Tapbooty because you can cash out any amount via PayPal starting at $1. That's extremely convenient. 




 What's the difference? I mean, there are "Anti-DUI" commercials, but even drinking without operating a motor vehicle can be extremely harmful if not done responsibly, just like smoking cigarettes can be. 




 I guess it makes sense since a person obviously took this photo, but it kinda freaked me out when I first saw it. 









 _ You guys suck

:-P 









 The line is cliche to the point that most girls will see it coming a mile away.

 Thanks for the x-post. It's much appreciated. 




 To answer your question that has nothing to do with the topic at hand, I bought a 65" rear projection TV some years ago, and it wouldn't fit through the front door of the house. We had to take it in through the back, and instead of taking the TV to my bedroom, I took my bedroom to the TV.

And all the landline cords and the router/modem setup is in the basement, since that's actually the most conducive place to put it based on how my house is built, and I don't have the Wi-Fi device for my Xbox 360. So, if I'm upstairs, no Xbox Live, and no TV to play it on anyway. 




 There are probably at least a half-dozen places in my basement where cold air is coming in. Windows, maybe tiny cracks in the walls, etc. Any advice?

I live by myself in a two-story, two-bedroom house, and neither of the bedrooms are furnished, so I can't just sleep upstairs (unless I really wanted to take everything, bed and all, up two flights of stairs, which would be beyond pointless). 




 Mostly instaGC. I've also tried Tapbooty since they have a very low cashout minimum for PayPal. I've gotten one or two to work on instaGC, none on Tapbooty, and Prize Rebel is another one I've tried downloads on. I've had roughly the same success there as I've had on instaGC. 




 I can rarely get them to credit. I download whatever it is they want me to download (with Sandboxie), install all the stupid little add-ons that come with it, get to the finish page of the installation wizard, but a lot of times, I get no points.

Is there some way to better ensure that I get credited for download offers? I see people saying that they make $10 a day on downloads alone-- I want that, too ;_; 




 I'll try to keep this as brief as I can, since I tend to ramble.

I'm 6'4 (almost 200 cm/2 meters for those on the metric system-- and no, that's not my real height with 2-3 inches added), and it seems like the world isn't designed for people my height and taller. I constantly have to bend down/lean forward to grab or look at things, and as a result, I have a really bad slouch. It's to the point where standing/sitting perfectly straight feels like a workout.

I have no idea how to fix this problem, since I'm so used to the way I stand and sit right now (I'm 25, and I've been 6'2-6'4 since I was about 16 or 17 I think).

What can I do to fix this problem? I don't want my spine to be permanently mangled by the time I'm 50-60; at the same time, though, I think I should take baby steps with this until I get more accustomed to standing/sitting straight.

Thanks, guys. 




 You shouldn't hit on trees, then. 




 She might not have one. 




 This isn't a pickup line per se, but I've always found this situation to be frustrating. She's super hot, but you can't chat her up during your transaction-- it doesn't take long enough, and you can't just stand there holding up the people behind you. So here's what I do (and it's worked a couple times).

What you'll need: A pen, a post-it note, and a little bit of stealth

What you do: Walk into the store, ID the girl you want to talk to. As soon as you walk in, make sure she can't see you put the pen on the counter-- a good way to do this is to do it as you bend down to tie your shoes (leave one shoe untied to make it more convincing).

When you're checking out, put your items on the counter and put your post-it note to the side (maybe take it out of your pocket as if you're looking for your money/wallet/card and just want to discard it for a second).

This is where the pen from the beginning comes in. Ask her "Hey, can I borrow that pen?" She'll assume it's the store's, and she'll say sure.

While she's ringing you up, write your name and number on the post-it note. Take your items and your change, and then give her this:

"Oh, here's your pen back... thanks. And here's my phone number. Call me."

And then calmly walk out of the door with a smile on your face. MAKE SURE YOU SMILE. Add a wink if you're feeling particularly confident. It also helps if you can at least make small talk during the process-- try to make her laugh or smile.

Like I said, this has worked for me at least twice, and one time it didn't work, the girl still said it was "cute."

Just thought I'd share a solution to a problem I hate. Didn't really know where else to put it.

This is gonna get downvoted straight to the eighth circle of Hell, isn't it? :-( 




 You have 2K15 on Xbox One? 




 Do you have Xbox One? 




 Do you have 2K15 for Xbox One? 




 WTF is this shit? Nobody said it was a good idea. I'm making an educated guess based on what's been happening. Chill the hell out, dude.

And Ryback being heel isn't a bad idea. Ryback being heel and being booked the way he was is a bad idea. Jesus H. Christ... 




 Do you have Xbox One? 




 He just doesn't seem to be on the same page as the rest of Team Cena, even calling the team "Team Cena and Team Ryback." 




 With another human player, since putting on a good match is a good deal about communication, and one can't really communicate with the AI.

I used to do this with a friend of mine, but he has a PS4 now and I've got an Xbox One.

Anyone ever considered the thought/want to try it? 




 I never saw the Halloween series :-(, so whenever I see this, I'm reminded of Jason Voorhees. 




 It was indeed. Also, if you look closely when it happens, Harper is by far the first one to react to the music. My friend and I joked that it's because he was the only one who recognized it. 









 Also, for what it's worth, I struggle with countering, if anyone knows anything one can do to get better in that area. 




  I'm kinda nostalgiaing everywhere

Feel free to continue doing so :D 




 I should have mentioned that I want to get better at defense mostly, although this is still good advice. 




  You're also aware that Spartan is basically a Leon and Bayman clone, right? Both of them are in DOA5.

I like the fact that her character model is a Spartan. I find that to be pretty damn cool. 




 But the catch here is that I need a source of knowledge for Dead or Alive **4**, not 5. I play 4 because I like using Spartan-458, and she's not in DOA5.

Or another option would be to just use DOA5 guides and strategy, if the two games are similar enough. But I don't know if they are.

Let me know which option would be better?

Thanks. 




 Or is 120 over 80 simply a myth?

I was told the latter by a nurse practitioner's assistant during my last routine checkup with my family physician. 




 It's not like all of that will magically equate into being able to breakdance. He still had to learn how to do it. 




 Oh, boy... this feels like *300.*

**Our downvotes will blot out the sun!**

**... then I will post in the shade.**

Okay... once. Only once. She really liked me, I really liked her, she was super hot, and we were in bed together watching a movie... oh, and I forgot to mention that she's a borderline alcoholic who can't handle her liquor. Bad combination.

Anyway, the inevitable happened, and I tried, I *really, really tried* to resist the urges. Devil on one shoulder, angel on the other... let's face it. Considering it was the first time and I wasn't ready for it, the angel didn't stand a chance and pretty much got gunned down immediately by ol' Beelzebub.

I stopped the movie we were watching and turned off the TV. I went to undo her belt and take off her jeans, and by the time I did that, she was actually forcing my head into her crotch with both hands. I had never given oral sex before, so I tried to tell her no, but (and I doubt she even remembers any of this), she persisted, so I considered it a tradeoff.

I went down on her after I undressed her down to her lingerie, while also touching her sensually the way I like. We both got what we wanted that night (I think so... I'm still not sure how good I was-- she did a lot of heavy moaning, though, so that's worth something, I guess).

Anyway, that's the story. Nobody had to use a rape whistle, or get their brother to beat anybody up, and no one went to jail. It went pretty much as well as it possibly could have, for both parties involved.

 Parents? HELL no.

Friends? Some. Only the ones I'm closest to.

As far as women I'm with, I tell them up front. This is the sort of thing that you don't really want coming up without warning. _

Anyways, I just explain to them how I tend to prefer soft, romantic touching, kissing, etc., over harder, erotic bedroom activities. Then I usually ask them if they like to spoon, and if they say yes, then I ask if I can do things while they're asleep, like touch, kiss, undress them, etc.

Having this conversation with a woman is a LOT easier than it sounds. I've never gotten a "No" when asking if I can act on this fetish.

Jesus must love me, because I never thought that would happen the first time I told a woman about this. I thought for sure she'd be creeped out and run away immediately. _

:-P 




 I don't have a rep since this is my first post, but I'm willing to trade. I'll PM you. 




 Nah, you shouldn't. I'd pay her waaaaaaay more than $100 to get blackout drunk in my bed if I could. 




 _ No, not her *literally*. Her pornos. lol.

Although I would definitely pay a woman to do this. 




 The name sounds familiar, but I mostly don't pay attention to the names of the people in the porn that I watch.

The only sleep fetish porn star I can name off the top of my head is Jasmine Mendez. She's sooooooo hot... I've spent at least $100 on her.

**EDIT:** How do YOU know about Sleep Creep? 




  Where do you actually find this type of porn? Is it just called sleep fetish?

Pretty much. Hell, there are [YouTube videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3LvpaUWQ0Y) that aren't even porn that I can masturbate to. The lack of intercourse isn't a big deal, since I'm not a big fan of it.

Yes, I and my sex drive are both extremely weird.

 What do you think it is about this that get's you worked up?

The freedom to do what I want without being judged, perhaps. Like I said, I don't like intercourse at all. Contrarily, women want to be fucked. I don't want to fuck. I just want to touch a woman's body sensually-- I can and have done so literally all night more than once.

If the woman is unresponsive (but not dead-- just making sure we establish that I would never even think about going that far), she doesn't have to be annoyed by my weird sexual habits and impulses. 




 I love answering questions about this, so ask me absolutely anything.

A little context just in case people don't quite understand the extent of this fetish, in my case at least-- during standard intercourse, I can't ejaculate if the woman is responsive at all, and I can't achieve an erection while watching anything but sleep fetish pornography (oh yeah, it exists).

AMA!

Survivor Series will be a sad day.

I know you're gonna be disappointed that the above link isn't what you probably thought it'd be, but I *swear* that actually happened. 




 Thank you, Captain Pretentious 




 In all fairness, they have kissed on camera. 




 Nikki has a face? 




 I live for danger. 




 We got us some flyin' downvotes, Maggle 









 No, I'm not! I don't love Her anymore!

... yes, I do. 




 In kayfabe, is Brock Lesnar the greatest wrestler of all time? 




 Ah, my mistake.
