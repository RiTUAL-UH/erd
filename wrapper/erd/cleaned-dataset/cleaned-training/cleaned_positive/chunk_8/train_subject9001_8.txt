 If the moment and environment is right, most definitely. 
  




 Nude beaches sound awesome, I've always hated having to wear a bathing suit.  




 Another cool thing: I can now say Slipknot's seen my tits! 




 What's funny is I've never gotten groped before crowd surfing. I wasn't even the one who took the top off in the first place, some random guy did. But I must admit being stripped against my will and groped was pretty exhilarating! 









 I feel like it can be difficult to always be there for someone in that state, as hard as it is to actually be in that state. It's hard to just get out of the hole you're in. You can't just leap out, you have to take small steps, climb slowly, make progress. It's fine if you slip a little bit, it's fine if you need to stop and take a rest. It's fine if you need someone to help you. The most important thing is the fact you want to get out. You know, this is your journey and you just gotta keep moving
 




 Since you can relate to my post so well, you should look up Atypical Depresssion. Out of all the symptoms I've googled and disorders I've read about, atypical depression is definitely the one I've been able to relate to the most  




 I am, and I have noticed that I'm much more likely to slip into depression a week before my period, but I don't always. I looked up PMDD, it does seem to be fitting
