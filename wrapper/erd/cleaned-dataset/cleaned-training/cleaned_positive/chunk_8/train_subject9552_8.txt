 HOLY SHIT YES I WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY THIS BLESS YOU  




 Many things can make you fall in love with a book.


* Words strung together so well they echo your feelings. Or melt you into a puddle. Or hit your chest like a hard *pang!*


* A character in the book whose words you read make you feel more like you're staring into a murky reflection of yourself in a puddle. A character that says a few words to you while you're caught in a busy intersection that grasps your complete attention in an instant and makes the commotion around you seem like a white noise. A character that was your first love.


* A story that not only puts you into the character's shoes, but lets you feel the frayed leather soles with your toes. A story that makes you forget yourself and take the form of a rolling camera. 

I want to discover books that are not only written well, but provide meaning to readers. I thought I might ask you guys. What is your favorite book? And why (I would really like to hear about this).


I have a lot of books that I loved, but I would say my favorite it Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli. It was a book I read as a little girl and several times later, but the memories of the imagery really hold a special place in my heart. Please do tell me yours. :)
