 Haha man I would totally ask someone to do it for me. I need to work on being upfront though, instead of letting people rule me. I mean she doesn't even sound like she wants to see me or the city, so whatever. I'll think about how to say it and not sound rude though ^^ 




 You're right. And anyway, sounds like she doesn't even want to come so win-win for the both of us. 




 Exactly. I can't believe she can't even discern those people's hospitality. You're a stranger, and they're cool with you coming over. That should be enough to be extra thankful for.  




 (Hopefully the person in question doesn't know Reddit)

(edit) Crap I got the title wrong. I mean, the expression wrong. Spot the non-English speaker! 

So I was trying to be nice to this "friend" from college. She's visiting the country, visiting as many cities as possible, and I was like "Hey! Come and stay at my place for a few days!" and she was all "Yes! Of course!"

To put everything into context: I live with a host family, who from the very beginning told me it would be okay to invite people to sleep at their place (I don't know why this topic came up, I never asked them because I never planned on inviting people). Fastforwards few months later, that friend tells me about her plans. 

Fastforward to the past couple of days. One, she doesn't want to spend as much days as she originally planned. Ok cool. Whatever. Thought we were friends but whatever. Second, she's just told me that she may come at a later date to visit another city before. Um. No? I have told the host family I'm with that you were coming on a set date. Don't be changing it all the time. They are putting aside some of the things they have planned to welcome you, too. And then she asked me, and I fucking swear: What does they have to do with me?

WHAT? WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SLEEPING? This is not a fucking hotel! 

I'm cool. I just need enough courage to tell the girl not to come. I don't deal with princesses. 

Anyway. How was your day? I hope better than mine! :D  




 Lucky you! I can only imagine the view!  




 It does sound pretty great.  




 * yet! We never know ; )
(I mean it's not like you must found a place like that)  




 Yeah I guess not.  




 Oh wow. I can understand why this place is special to you. 




 Cool! Where is that?  




 Looks peaceful! I would love to see that during the fall!  




 Nice to know! Is there any way for you to go back there?  




 Some positive nostalgia haha. I hope you get to visit that place soon!  




 That looks great! Where is it?  




 Ah cool! What's so special about it?  




 Yes! [Dominoes but with three sides](http://jungmami.bplaced.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/07092012651.jpg). It's really fun, and a little bit more challenging since you can count points, and there are "special moves" (like three or four?).  




 True! Been here for only a year! : ) 




 Man did not know Canada was that different. I mean, I can expect the territories to be different, but Calgary? Nice to know. 




 True. I was shocked to see that vegetables and fruits are free in some markets. I bought tostitos salsa, and it was considered a vegetable ... got it for free!  




 What? Where in Canada are you from? It's literally the same. 




 **If you don't have pictures to share, it's okay too!!**

I mean, like a secret not-so-secret place you love so much, you'd only allow the people you love or care about the most to know about it. 

In Montreal, it used to be [this caf√©](http://a141.idata.over-blog.com/4/38/24/30/cafe-neve-devanture.jpg) (here's an [inside look](http://www.ellequebec.com/img/photos/biz/ELLEQuebec/culture/Vie%20Culturelle/VC-CafeNeve-intro1.jpg), with the owner on the far right. i used to have the biggest crush on this guy), now I'm in Germany, and it's [this place](http://41.media.tumblr.com/100e2bd0c3cb3a85885e92bea1f9e349/tumblr_nox44hkLMD1r7qdrvo1_1280.jpg) (my picture, so yeah it doesn't really do it justice). Nothing special, but damn. I'm in love. 

How about you? Show me those special locations!  




 Real talk, flour. Raw flour. If I control myself, I can eat one pound in four days. If I go batshit crazy, probably one pound in one day. 

Other than that, I think tostitos come to a close second, though the saltiness would hurt the corner of my lips, so I'd stop before that I guess.  




 I connect with no one at all, so there's that. I don't see myself ever connecting with someone on Reddit. I don't feel like I really belong. On other websites, it has happened maybe ... twice. Which is good enough for me (but I've lost contact with those people). 

I'm too strange. But oh well.  




 If I find someone to play with, absolutely. Though the last time I had the chance to play it, it was actually triomino. 




 loh-l. My first language is French so there's that.  




 Same here. I don't find motivation in anything, and I don't feel jealousy eh ... 60% of the time. I'm always super happy when someone finds genuine happiness. Like "Wow, you made it! Continue on! I'm proud of you! :')" type of happiness.  




 Definitely happens on Tumblr as well, but on a smaller scale. It's just easy to filter the bad things out, I think.  




 And you know what, I totally understand what you mean by not wanting to get help for it. But I do wish you don't sit through depression or anything else that may be harmful because it sucks! I hope one day it just gets better. Or maybe you get used to it so it stops bothering you? I don't know. Just hope you don't feel miserable. 

And sure, we can talk if you wish! : ) 




 I guess the fact that many people have different experiences proves that all websites are the same : ) Some people find legit comfort in Instagram or Twitter, and I have to figure out why. To me, those two apps/websites are cold. How do you bond with people? But to some, it's heaven on Earth. To me, my heaven on Earth is Tumblr. And honestly, I think it's easier to select who you want to deal with because you pick and choose who you get to see on your dashboard. For you, I guess it's Reddit.

But yeah. What bothers me with Reddit is that it seems to be the only website out of the few I named that really believes it's the best out there, by shitting on other websites. And sorry I didn't know most of reddit were young. I guess I spent too much time on subreddits where most people are (unless they're lying) like 25+ men.  




 I used to have a therapist actually. In college. It helped to have someone to talk with. That's all.

I took a gap year to do the thing I am doing now, which is childcare in exchange of free boarding in a foreign country (I chose Germany). Actually where I used to live, college is a thing you go to before university. I would have graduated this month. No regrets though. I am thinking of studying elsewhere since I would need to finish college if I were to go back to my province, and I feel like I've wasted enough time. I can go to uni (almost) anywhere else. I really don't want to study what I want, because like I said, I don't want to start hating it, and two, working with children doesn't mean working only with children. You're working with an entire system. I will never be alone doing my job, and I don't want to feel stressed out and not do anything.

And for games, I only play single-player games. Multi-player games is just. Stressful. 

It's ridiculous. I wish I could be someone else and just start over with a new brain or something. Or have someone hit my head really hard, in hopes that not only do I get severe amnesia, but I also change personality, have no issues at all, etc. It's hard to explain to most people. They think you can just snap out of it. But you can't! It's like your brain has its own mind, and you can only go through whatever it puts you through. Like when I get attention, my brain just goes "this is stressful this is stressful they're looking at you you suck you're failing stop existing." or anything similar, literally non-stop, and I can't just shake it off because that's literally my brain telling me this. The thing that controls me from A to Z. I cannot go against it unless I kill myself. Or sleep I guess. 

Anyway. Again, thank you. Sorry for making you go through these lengthy uninteresting paragraphs though.  




 Do you have a school counsellor? Though I personally think college counsellors are better, because they treat you more naturally. Where do you live? Maybe you can find help for free?  




 Yes. Anything where I have to "perform", I try to avoid. For instance, I want to learn the piano. The father I'm working for said he would teach me. Three weeks in, I gave up. I shake whenever I approach the piano now, because I feel like if I don't do good, I'm a huge failure and he'll be disappointed, etc.. Also, lately I bought a bike for fun (after years of not riding one), and on my first day with the bike, the family said they'd go on a bike tour with me. The entire time, the father was like "Go faster! Let's race! Catch up!" Now guess who hates to ride a bike now and who feels extremely nervous just knowing it's there. But sometimes, acknowledging my presence is enough to make me freak out. If a group and I were to go out for instance, I rather walk behind them because knowing that they're constantly acknowledging my presence by me being next to/in front of them stresses me out. I very rarely am with just one person for that reason. I can't handle someone's undivided attention. 

And I would love to be a teacher to any children, any type of school, any topic. But for some reason, I am really interested in schools dedicated for children with problems, from attachment issues to Down Syndrome. I watched a documentary on a deaf-blind 'institute' in Germany, and wow. I would do that for free if I could. I even started learning ASL in hopes of working in such a place. But again, besides children (under the age of 10, I'd say) and animals, I cannot handle people's attention. If you look at me, I will automatically stop whatever I'm doing and just look boring so you can look away. I automatically do this and it drives me nuts! Sometimes, I could be talking to the child I am taking care of and then as soon as I hear the door open because a parent is back, I start whispering, then it slowly fades into silence. 

And as for games, I like playing one game. I used to be so into it, I would spend 12+ hours a day on it (the other 12 hours I'd sleep, eat, take care of my hygiene and give my computer a short break because, you know. Overheating). Now I don't play because I rather play on a PC, but I have a Macbook. I lost interest in most other games. I used to be an avid nintendo DS player when the 'DS Lite' came out, then a couple of months ago I got another one because I thought I missed it. Turns out I don't, unfortunately. I can't find the fun anymore. I feel like I just tossed money out the window. Good thing I never bought myself something like an Xbox. 

Hey, by the way, thanks for trying to help. I really appreciate it.  




 I guess the first one is the lie?  




 Maybe you should try seeing someone? I mean, if you want. But sometimes it can be really helpful to see a therapist. I know it's not the easiest thing to do.

Are you in college?  




 The thing I have legit interest in, I would hate to work into that. I hate doing things I like when there is stress or when it involves other people. Right now, I am taking care of a child (I love it), and when the parents are around, I literally just sit and watch the kid. As soon as they're gone, I turn into the cool friend/entertainer/teacher he might like. All this because I feel super anxious around people, but if I'm alone with children or animals, I'm totally okay. I could teach young children, but I obviously won't be alone with those kids. Funny thing is that I wouldn't mind being filmed at all. I almost hope the family I am working with has a nanny cam or mics somewhere, so they know I don't neglect their child. 

I also like astronomy, but I suck in maths, never had proper science courses either. I would, again, hate to study it because yeah. I don't want to study it. I just want to lose my shit over the fact that we have a robot heading towards Pluto right now, or that we will eventually send another one on Venus, or we have a couple on Mars ... etc. I once took a geography course because I am into it, but after that course, despite doing really well (so to avoid the argument "maybe you hate it because you failed"), I hated geography for a while. 

Hmmm what else. I like ... games? I actually like playing one game, but it's been a while since I last played it. I wish to start again, but I'm scared to lose interest.

That's about it. Other than that, I just waste time. All day long. 




 I meant more like, wanting to be muscular then succeeding, then looking in the mirror and being like "ugh. ew no."  




 That sounds cool! How did you figure out it was what you wanted to do?  




 No, I don't really have any hobbies. :/ 




 Thank you! : ) 




 I admire your positivity, but that last sentence, I don't think so. I don't see how I'll have friends and find someone if I literally never go out or talk to people and have no real social skills.  




 Oh my, I can totally relate! But have you seen someone for that depression?  




 I thought it would be like that for me too, and actually when I started college, I forced myself to be sociable. But after two months of ease and what I thought was happiness, I panicked. I hated it, in fact. And during that time, I would spend more and more time isolated, and it felt so good. But part of me keeps saying "Wtf is wrong with you?! Go out and do things!" But I hate doing things ... I don't know, sometimes I just feel like I've failed as a human being. The few things I like are seen as lazy, antisocial, blablabla.  




 Thank you so much! : ) 




 I don't know. I just want to do things that seem to bring joy to people, even though 99% of said things, I find either stupid, useless, a waste of time ... 

I have yet to find happiness in being, you know. What society would call a party pooper, dark cloud, antisocial, weird ... and whatever negative terms there is in contrast to people my age.  




 I'm sorry this makes no sense, but anyone else wants to be or have something they can't seem to actually enjoy? For instance, I really want to be the stereotypical young adult, but in reality, I hate going out, hate being sociable, hate drinking, hate the idea of hooking up, don't see myself in a relationship, etc.. And I hate hating it.

Anyone else? 

 




 Currently living in Germany, but am an American who has resided in Montreal from 2004 to 2015. Honestly, I feel really stuck. I wish I could just fastfoward to seven years from now, be done with school and have a job. Part of me wants to go to school so I can get a good paying job, but then I know I am not patient enough. I've been in school for 17 years! (if you don't include this gap year I took). I really want to advance with my life and be done with 'Chapter 1'. I want to have a paycheck, pay for things, do my taxes ... the whole deal. But I don't even know what job I would like to have. I have no passion at all. 

As for the location, I'm just glad I had the chance of living in countries with pretty good social systems. My first years of life were lived in a really terrible country, though my family was well-off but you know. I had eyes and I could see that not everyone was as lucky as I was. I am not saying misery doesn't exist in Canada and Germany, but it's definitely more bearable and fixable compared to my country of origin, and the majority of countries in the world.  




 Nope, not yet. Conchita just stopped singing though. I guess it's next.  




 Yeah good thing you missed it. It was crap. Well, it was "good", which is bad. It was so formal, everyone or almost sang ballads. It was boring as hell. I'm a little bummed because it's my first time watching it live from Europe, and all the clips I'd see online were of silly people doing unholy or just batshit crazy things. Yeah. None of that this year. 

The most exciting moment so far is Conchita Wurst's short wig. And she just appeared with it, and voting is already closed.  




 Same. And the omnipresence of pro-LGBT in the Eurovision. LGBT flags everywhere, same-sex people kissing live on stage, Conchita Wurst ... Today's a good day.  




 I am not disagreeing! I am just saying that I'm pretty sure everyone's opinion is biased because he is a guy. And I was talking about that. Didn't go into the whole creepy stuff because shit accusing someone of being creepy when you don't know anything is damaging. Also, English was obviously not his first language and maybe the way he writes came off as odd as well. Like damn. That's all I was saying.  




 Of course no one would be like "Yeah cuz you're a man, I think it's creepy." but if you read through the discussions happening, you'll see this point being brought up. And I commented on one of this discussions, saying that the majority of people and society think it's creepy because he's a man. That is literally what my comment was saying. That if he was not a man, I would not feel uncomfortable, like most people have admitted in this thread.  




 It's pretty boring right now. It's my first time actually watching the entire show (I usually watch bits from YouTube), and I've cheered more for Conchita than any other contestants. Oh except Serbia. Loved her. 

But yeah, people are so serious this year. Some girl on social media say "Well, we have guests this year so we gotta behave" and honestly, I think it's that haha. I am not even European, but right now I am residing in Germany.  




 Because the entire thread is a gender situation, and my comment was about a gender situation. I don't know why then you would engage in a conversation with me if you're going to be talking about another topic.  




 I understand your point, but you also have to understand the hypocrisy of this. If it were a woman, we would be saying nothing at all. We would be applauding her, calling her generous, brave, etc. Actually that happens quite a lot. Think of teachers who grow fund of a student who happen to have a shitty life at home, etc. Yeah. We wouldn't be saying anything. But we're conditioned to be more aware of red flags when it's a man.

Not saying he *can't* be doing anything wrong, but from the little we know, I don't think it's wise to go directly to that conclusion.  




 Totally agree with you. The worst is that I felt uncomfortable too. I feel so hypocritical!

Anyway society has done a good job brainwashing. Funny thing is that if he legally adopted her, I wouldn't have thought about it too much. But the whole "from a stranger off the street" thing gets me. 




 Reminds of this kid in college who would take out his guitar and play before class. I was in a small program, meaning we shared many classes together. The kid was not even taking any music classes. He just liked to sing and play the guitar, which is cool, but not in a classroom when no one asked you to take care of the background music.  




 Oh I see. Sorry I misunderstood. But yeah it depends on the program. The things I would like to study would require me to speak the language. So I would need to be at a university level of German.  




 Thank you for your input! : ) 




 I don't agree. Why live in a country if you don't try to speak the language? I am perfectly capable of doing it, so why not do it? My problem is if I want to stay here and lose two years of college, or not live here and go to school right away. 

Also, there aren't that many courses taught in English. It depends on the program. Germany is not like Sweden.  




 Hey, did you know that New Horizons is weeks away from passing by Pluto (10 000 km away from it)! To put that a bit more into perspective, remember that the moon is 384 400 km away! However, we won't get good pictures before a while! First off, Pluto is far okay. Second, sending large images would take time. Third, sending thousands of images will take time. If I recall correctly, we will get all the informations ever taken by New Horizons some time in late 2016. However we will have plenty to be excited about by autumn/winter 2015.

What will be stressful will be the hiatus moment New Horizons will take before the flyby to take pictures. When it sends images to Earth, it cannot take pictures. When it is taking pictures, it cannot send them. Well, at some point it will be able to take a picture that will be sent almost instantaneously to Earth, but not in the very beginning. 

The first of the last files it'll be sending before the flyby is sent in case New Horizons fails right before said flyby. The pictures won't be good, they'll be small, not very attractive (but still pretty cool!) It's called E Health. Then, for like an entire day or something, there won't be any news from New Horizons. It's busy taking as much infos and pictures as possible. Then, after a long work day (haha), the night of the flyby, New Horizons will send a file named Phone Home, just to tell scientists it did it. The next day, it'll send a file named First Look. It will have some important science data. Late July will be the beginning of an eight week long data sharing period. September, it will send all the images it ever took, which could take about 10 weeks. After that, it will send all science data it ever took, which is what will take a good year. 

I'm super excited. Especially for the "Phone Home" call. It's like sending your child to college in another country 24 hours away by plane, and then finally getting an "I made it" text. 

Are you into astronomy?  




 Hey! my day has not really started yet, but I've planned something. I am doing my laundry now, will put it in the dryer as soon as it's done, then I'll head out for a little stroll. I was thinking maybe eating out, then take the train for an hour (and just chill there, without any real destination) then I would buy a snack and get ready for the Eurovision too! : ) 




 Ha, I am a bit biased too. I love the US, even though I never really lived there. I was born in Brooklyn, literally in the middle of the ghetto, and my family and I would visit 2-3 times a year for ten years, and oh my. I love this place with all my heart. However, reality hit. NYC is expensive as hell! Even Brooklyn, the freaking ghetto, is expensive! How am I going to survive? 

And honestly, I don't have a hard time with Germany when it comes to the language. Probably because I am an hermit, and I stay home 99% of the time. The only people I have talked with are cashiers (besides the host family I live with). I speak it a little bit, but not at a university level. Germans (like most people) are not patient with people who don't speak their language anyway. Learning it is no big deal, but I don't know for how long I am willing to stay out of school. 

As for my family, it's complicated. I can't just expect to have a peaceful life because I chose to. My culture is crazy. Parents don't have to respect their kids at all. They do whatever they want to you because you're the kid (even if you're like 50+), and they're grown. And I am not one who thinks that "Blood  Everything". So yeah. No thank you. No family for me. I mean, if we keep a distance, fine. But I feel like I can only control how much they can say or do to me only if I keep a distance. Like I wouldn't want them to spontaneously show up at my door one day. I know they won't do that if I live across the ocean. 

Thanks for your input though : ) 




 Yes we looked into that, and for some reason, we have not found a class yet. There is another school dedicated to learning German, and they suck! I mean, first of all, they are rude as hell. I had to leave once because the level of rudeness was out of control. Second time I came to take a placement test, they didn't give me a proper test, just talked for a few seconds, asked me how many classes I've had before, and that's it. There was only one class available for my level, and literally the day it was supposed to start, they cancelled it. 

The other reliable language school won't have classes before August. 

I guess I landed in the wrong city, at the wrong time.  




 Yeah I know, but I meant if I were to get into financial trouble, it would be nearly impossible to bounce back (as a kid in college). I don't know if it's that serious of a problem, since yes, people find it problematic but it doesn't seem to be something everyone is eager to change for some reason. I don't know. the US is messed up, but being a citizen and all, it would be so easy to just. Move there. (plus I guess nostalgia is making me miss America a little too much, and I kinda want to live there).  




 I understand. And yes, I have taken German classes for about a year and a half in college (Canada), and this summer I will be taking another class. It's surprisingly hard to find a German class that isn't too expensive here. 

Thank you for your input! : ) 









 I used to. I got into it way after it changed its shows into reality stuff. I stopped simply because I generally stopped watching television.

I don't understand why people hate reality TV so much. If it's not your cup of tea, cool. Of course it's not 100% reality, because not everyone has that exciting of a life, so those reality TV shows must show you things in a way or at a frequency that makes you believe "wow, cool".

I loved TLC because watching those shows about certain people was like checking on people you've gotten used to. Like ~~Jon and~~ Kate plus 8. "That lady who had six babies in one day, how is she doing?" Or "This couple suffering from dwarfism, have they had their child?" etc. I personally never liked the Duggars because one minute of this show and it was obvious what was going on. Those kids were brainwashed as hell, the older brother was always so obviously creepy, the father was even worse, and the sisters and youngest kids deserved so much better. I'm hoping those two who got married will somehow start a change because they are both so obviously intelligent and strong-minded. The little kids would benefit from a better lifestyle. I feel for them.

And I see a lot of people talking about how it used to be The Learning Channel. Well History channel used to be about history. National Geographic used to be about geography. Discovery Channel used to teach you a lot of stuff. Now it's like Pawnshop wars or BBQ wars or cars wars or whatever the actual titles are. TLC is not the only one that changed. 




 That's the thing. Reddit is no different than any other websites. You can find amazing communities just like those on Reddit on 4Chan, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr ... The problem is that Reddit seems to be the only one out of those that believes their communities are much better than the others, when it is literally the same. The only difference is that the majority of Reddit users are old men. Doesn't make them any smarter or mature. But they're convinced their age (even gender) is enough to prove they're better. 




 A bunch of people who think they're better than other websites, by behaving exactly like people from said other websites. e.g.: 4Chan, **TUMBLR**, Facebook, Instagram ...

Except this subreddit. This subreddit awesome.  




 Haiti! :D 




 Hello! Nice to hear from a fellow INFJ!  




 Hello, fellow human part of the 1%! :D 




 Same! Haha I don't think I'm inspiring, but maybe I can be convincing if the confidence is with me. A few times, I would be so deep in a debate and have no new arguments left, that I just repeat myself with other words and the people take it as new ones (then they're like wow, she came prepared!). Have you ever noticed, when you speak, people looking at you "You sound eloquent but that makes no sense to me!" It makes them second-guess their opinion, and I guess that counts as convincing.  




 Twin! I've found you!  




 Ah, thanks yes this makes more sense. Maybe we're more empathic. Though would you "feel" for strangers too? Like you see someone ranting about having a terrible day online, would you feel for them?  




 Yay! Let's celebrate being part of the cool kids of this world! : ) 




 Yeah! But another comment has said maybe we're just empathetic easily, which I can agree with. If were were to see someone crying in the bus, maybe we would feel for them immediately (without really doing anything else)? Are you the same?  




 Hey! 

14% F. which means sometimes, when logic fails me, I go with the flow. It's something I've been working on ever since I graduated high school. Can't say it is working for me though. 




 Somehow comforting. Of course, no one knows you better than you, but somehow knowing that you're a 'thing' (aka, describable) and that you're not the only one described a certain way, is really comforting. I mean, most of the things said, I knew it already about myself. But for a random website to "know" those descriptive terms and to share them with me, means I'm not an extremely alien type. There are other people out there, similar to me. Even though my group is just 1% of people, which explains why I personally always feel so odd, an outcast, and even "crazy". Asking for help when you're lost and so different from the majority can be difficult. But yeah. At least I'm not doomed! I know some people I can relate to personally have lived. I just need to know how to take advantage of my strengths and how to overlook my weaknesses.  




 Of course : ) 




 I have to say though, many other facts might have led to these results despite me being completely different. I don't talk nor approach people (and I did let the test know that), so I find it weird that it would think that I find it easy to connect with people. Maybe if I were not socially anxious all the time, I would, but as of right now, not really. 

And yeah, I agree! Some things were so accurate! Amazing!  




 ADVOCATE (INFJ-T). I half agree with it. For instance, it says that we take initiatives. I don't really. I mean, I would but some things are stopping me (anxiety). Also, 
 "INFJs **find it easy to make connections with others**, and have a talent for warm, sensitive language, *speaking in human terms, rather than with pure logic and fact.*" 

That's false. 100%.


However,
 People with the INFJ personality type are **unlikely to go for friendships of circumstance**, like workplace social circles or chatting up their local baristas, where the only thing they really have in common is a day-to-day familiarity. Rather, INFJs seek out people who share their passions, interests and ideologies, people with whom they can explore philosophies and subjects that they believe are truly meaningful.

That is so accurate, and it's so hard to explain this to other people. I don't want casual relationships. Others think it's a very asocial thing to be (well, it is I guess). 


Hey, by the way that was really interesting. Thank you so much : ) 




 YO. I live in a city that is a champion at that! It's in Germany, but I don't know how common it is. Dogs re extremely well behaved, as in most can walk without a leach. And I'm cool with that, as long as said dog is trained and not to nervous and very obedient. But the owners, they need seriously training. 
I walked to a supermarket that is like 200 meters away from my place, and I saw 12 dog poop piles. TWELVE. I am still mad about it, honestly. 

I miss my home city because people picked up their dog poop. And those who didn't were clever enough to have their dog poop on grass/mud. Not in the middle of the sidewalk.  




 The Haitian president is actually bald 




 I don't know if most people would consider it a hobby but, would you be into people watching? It's honestly fun. Just sit there somewhere at a caf√© maybe (those with outdoor seats), and just watch people. Or, walk. If you're not into walking, take the train to wherever! Or just go from terminal to terminal. 

I've personally lot motivation to do anything, and I think one of the reasons why I don't enjoy them is because doing things stress me out. And I don't enjoy stress very much. Walking, people watching or taking the train require no special ability or effort, so no stress for me.   




 South Korea, man. You'll have so much fun there, weather you're an introvert or an extrovert. This country, well at least Seoul, is perfect.  




 Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I'm not about this "don't make it too obvious" trend. Honesty is such a beautiful thing. Just be clear, honest, but not like. Creepy. By creepy, don't make her feel like she must go back to you, or something like that. Just share your feeling. See how she feels.  




 It's called Secrets d'Histoire. Once a month or so, they air a 1h30 ~ 2h00 long documentary, very often about a Royal, most often from France (well personally, I've only seen Royals from France, but since I have not seen all episodes, I don't know if they explore other countries or historical figures). Tonight, it was about Louis XVI, the last King of France. It's amazing how history is very ... how can I say this. Open to interpretation. I've seen a documentary about him many times before, and the last two times, he was described as a weak, fat, lazy man lacking libido and not really into his family life or his kingship. In that documentary, he was described as strong, cute, happy, nice, a great father, husband and king who tried his best for his people. His lack of libido was caused by a medical problem and how he was taught, his clumsiness was caused by his father and grandfather, and his brother's death, etc. What's funny is that those first documentaries were by Americans, so from a country Louis XVI helped, while that documentary was 100% French. Yet the French one (and you know, French people are not afraid to criticize) portrayed him so nicely. Honestly, I think he and his wife were extremely nice and great, just misunderstood and way too young to be Royals. Plus, he was not meant to be a King, so no one thought about teaching him anything about becoming a King so what did they expect?!

Anyway. I love this documentary so much. I think I'll go visit Versailles some time this autumn. 

Sorry you only asked the title and I gave you an entire essay haha.  




 I'm about to watch an episode of one of my favorite documentary series!!

Btw, that sounds yum. 




 I'm pretty sure if you try hard enough, you'll find an African in your ancestry line. If you're from Mid-Westernish Europe, the Mediterranean, Northern Africa and the middle East, you'll find a Jewish person, garanteed.  




 Man even the governments doesn't care about individuals. They have millions of others so they don't care about the few that want to or will die. 




 Thanks! Hey, may I ask where do you usually go to? We probably aren't from the same location but just to get an idea haha. : ) 




 This is really encouraging. I think I'd feel better if I brought some entertainment, that's for sure. 

Thank you for sharing! I think I'll start doing that!  




 I've been thinking about this lately! I always say I want to be a mother, blablabla but lately I've been second-guessing my skills as a mother, so I don't know. Also, I'm finding out that I'm at my happiest when I don't do anything and when I'm alone. 

I think I would just move to Paris and do nothing. Sounds bad, but it's honestly the most rewarding thing I could do. I'd wake up at maybe 9 or 10 am, watch TV while munching on cereals, then I'd go out to the market and buy whatever I need for the day, maybe flowers even. Then I'd go back home, watch some more TV while doing whatever: cleaning, laundry, folding clean laundry, learn something on the internet, whatever. Then I'd cook lunch/dinner. Later at night, I'd go out and walk around the city. People watching is a thing I enjoy a lot, so I would totally do that. Maybe I'd take a night train for a roundtrip. Not leaving the train, just sitting there and enjoying peace and quiet. Maybe I'll read, or play video games, or just chill and listen to music. Sometimes, if one of my favorite shows is being recorded, I'd go to said recordings. Right now, I really love a French TV Host who hosts a TV Show and a radio show, and I'd love to attend both. Or, I'd go and watch some theatre. Bigger theaters, smaller, independent artists. Whatever. Then if I get hungry, I'd go to one of those late-night caf√©s in Paris, and just eat whatever there is. 

Then I'd go to bed at midnight or 1 am, and start all over again. 

From time to time, I'd go to cities I like, rent an apartment, and do the same. New York some time during the winter, Seoul during the spring, maybe Vancouver a week during the summer? And back to Paris for the remainder fo the year. 

Oh, and maybe I'd get a cat.  




 Yo be happy there's no equality when it comes to bathrooms because trust me. Girls' bathrooms are nasty as fuck. Men have to deal with unflushed (or smeared?) pee and poop. Us girls have to deal with pee and poop and blood. Sometimes all together. Like girls on their period who think it's totally okay not to flush their bloody diarrhea, or who clog the toilet with their tampons/pads, or who leave the bathroom looking like a murder scene, AND THEY WON'T CLEAN UP. I sympathize with my fellow girls because being on your period sucks, BUT COME ON.  




 I'm sorry, this is long. 

I ~~usually~~ always talk about the negative, but let me talk about the positive. I was born in the US, but spent eight years, from 2 months to 8 years of age, on an island in the Caribbean. Mind you, my island used to be popular like most others, now it has a reputation of being "poor, dirty, broken, corrupted", which are all true, but it's not like the country has nothing to offer.

Anyway. I have to say, living on an island is pretty fun. We lived in the city, so the beach was not next door, but from my roof, we could see it. From time to time, my father would organize a trip to one of the most beautiful private-own beaches of the country. It was amazing! Also, the culture of my people may be too old-fashion and even barbaric at times, but other aspects are awesome. For instance, people are quite happy, despite the misery. And everyone is extremely lively and funny. One day, we were at a river, my dad's car got stuck in the mud, and while we were trying to get it out, two kids just ran towards the car to see what was happening. Those kids were obviously poor, not in school, but they climbed up the truck that was trying to pull my dad's car out the mud, and they had the time of their life. They tried helping (by directing the truck driver), they'd climb up and down ... at some point one ran out and came back with sugar canes to share with his pal to watch the show. In the end, my father gave them money and they were ecstatic. That money probably meant they'd finally have a real meal today (and it was 8 pm when we got stuck). Though this even took place way after I had moved out (I travelled there to visit), and I was no longer a child. 

Another thing I'll always remember is the other kids I grew up with. Outside of school, most of my friends were poor people. But it didn't matter. A story my parents told me is that after church, I'd run back home with them and I'd share yoghurt. I loved yoghurt and I am guessing I wanted them to love the thing I love. Again, most were poor, so to them, it was a great opportunity to get a snack, while to me, it was a great opportunity to convert my friends to yoghurt-ism. The most "daring" things I've done in my life were done with them. For instance behind my house, we had this steep slope I was not allowed to go near. Well, one day I went down on it, and climbed back up. Twice. Or one of them lived next to us, and to get to his house you had to climb a ladder. I was never allowed to climb a ladder, until one day I followed my dad to their house, and he wasn't going to leave me alone so I climbed. Or that time my friends were too poor to buy a kite (on a specific day, everyone flies a kite), so they made one, and that day I learned how to build kites. Ok, I never managed to fly a homemade one because I couldn't remember which material they used, but it was still fun.

In my country, if you have a little more money, it's common for your terrain to be used by many, if you allow it. My father's job allowed him to own not only our house, but a church and a school, all on the same terrain. So, people working for the church and/or the school sometimes resided on the premises as well. My first two houses were like that, and my third house was a smaller terrain without a school or church, but my uncle's house and a boutique was there, too. So it's like sharing your backyard with a bunch of people, which is always fun. 

Well, one day, I moved to my third house, which meant I'd leave behind most of my friends. However a couple of friends would still come over (those who could, meaning those who were fortunate enough), and I remember one day playing a video game on my N64 with one. We didn't speak English at all, but we tried to understand what to do in that game called Quest 64. At some point in the game, you get into a valley, and sometimes you encounter monsters. You can either escape (if you're far away enough) or fight them. Being terrified kids, we'd always escape if we could. So imagine two girls, scared to death, between the age of 6 and 8, screaming "ESCAPE!" with the most Caribbean-French accent in the world. (Pronounced kind of like: "Eh-skahp"). 

My main regret is to not have been more out there. I was quite sheltered, because both my parents grew up poor and they hated it, so since we were fortunate, they did not want me to associate too much with poor people (unless they're girls from the church we attended, because their mothers were nice or whatever). My grandmother was especially strict with that "rule". Before, they didn't care as much because we lived next to a school so of course kids would be everywhere. But when we moved for the third time, that was when the rule was 100% enforced. My uncle had adopted a boy my age, and they were kind of poor and I was not allowed to play with him at all because of that. They allowed me to play with my cousin sometimes only because we were blood relatives. Kinda sucks.

But yeah. There were those positives in my childhood. : ) 




 I never take a cart when I go grocery shopping alone. So I always go through the isles like twenty times to see what I need and can just hold without looking weird. One time I went grocery shopping with my dog. I had to carry said dog and whatever I was buying. Yeah. ~~I can't even drive a damn cart straight.~~ 




 Lately my anxiety has been quite ridiculous. For instance today, I have not left my room yet (it's 2:19 pm) and I am freaking out because later, I will have to go on a bike ride with some people. What has been working for you, when it comes to calming down when extremely nervous? 

Thank you! : ) 




 I have a thing for judge shows, and after weeks of Judge Judy and People's Court, [I'm all about Divorce Court now](https://41.media.tumblr.com/2a9c9759ed9d8f943361b39e1357da11/tumblr_nolfuosld31r7qdrvo1_1280.png).

I love Shooting Stars by Bag Raiders : ) 




 You know, if right now you think you're bisexual, then you might as well be. Maybe three months later you'll realize that you're not. Maybe twenty years later you'll realize you're not, or the day before you 99th birthday is when you realize "wow, I've always been straight." Or, maybe you'll feel comfortable calling yourself bi for the rest of your life!

Knowing your sexuality is tough, like knowing yourself as a whole is quite difficult. It's a matter of how you feel and what makes you feel comfortable. That may or may not change as you learn about yourself as you grow older. So yeah. Don't worry about labels. It's nice to know where you "belong" but don't expect it to always be a rigid tag.  




 Yeah like OP said, some stereotypes are negative. My race and age group seem to only have negative stereotypes ... :/ 




 Do you mean places like McDonald's or actual restaurants with a server coming at your table and taking your order? I would love to go to one on my own but I am terrified of stares and people potentially pitying me. 




 Pretty sure it was because of school? That's all I remember (and I remember running though the airport with my annoyed mother). I can't think of another reason tbh. Mother wasn't drunk and anyway it wasn't her. It was me who was stopped. 




 Long story short, when I was 5 or 6, a boarding agent refused to let me board my plane back home. Her reason? School was starting the next day, and I shouldn't miss any days. I was in Florida, and I am American but I never resided in the US. She didn't believe that we lived overseas, since "I was clearly American". What's weird is that since birth (and until the age of 9), I'd go to the US two or three times a year, and this has happened only once.

Almost missed our plane. People around us acted like it was "kind of her to be so considerate". 

Anyway. Can this happen? This was in 2001 or early 2002.  




 It's a French band (they sing in English though). Their name is Stuck in the Sound and the song in question is Toy Boy. 




 Last summer I went to South Korea. Throughout the entire trip, I listened to one song on repeat. Now, whenever I listen to this song, I remember South Korea. I especially remember the flights though. Probably because it was on repeat non-stop for close to 20-24 hours?
