 Well there is a lightning bolt to the left. . . 




 So I bought a Classic 40 pack and 14 GvG pack. Legendaries I pulled were surprisingly in good number. 

I ended up with: 1 Neptulon, 1 Golden Al'Akir the Windlord, 1 Captain Greenskin, 1 Golden Sylvanas Windrunner (already had a regular), and a Golden Sneed's Old Shredder.

The second golden had me floored, but a third just made me want to go hit the slots. Anyone have similar runs? 




 After the end of the show it had a quick word from the creators. They said something like that. 




 That is why I keep family numbers with no name on my phone. Eventually the picture of clicking a number to text just stuck in my head that I could memorize it.

 After tonight's episode it is leaning towards parallel universes. 




 Not to mention the Jay Garrick Helmet!

Hints of Earth 2 I think is stongly suggested when the Producers say they have a new way of introducing new enemies. 




 I would get an Action Comics #1 or something just as pivotal and host an event in which we get to watch each page get turned into glorious Origami creations. Would probably have to be a closed doors event that is streamed live in case of someone trying to stop it.  




 Suiciders has been pretty good. 




 Cool. 




 A lot of flagship issues from Mavel (#1s, Specials, and Major Tie-ins) it seems are at $4.99 a lot of the time. 




 All about that Dogecoin. . . 




 Especially if it is Hitler. 




 I have yet to get anynupdates for anything in humble bundles :/ 




 I heard it in Lee Daniel's The Butler. 




 They way the studios are forcing theatres to have a **significantly** higher amount of 3D than 2D shows for this movie, even if every 2D show sells out and 3D shows sell only half capacity, causes them to see that 3D is making more money.  




 Didn't they tease an early version of Brother Eye in Arrow earlier this season? Easily could have been the same virus. 




 Turns out a variant cover I was looking at was limited amount not the actual issue itself, so there is hope. 




 It seems to have been an animated youtube series that had a making of art book on sale currently. Honestly what got me excited for the comic comic out was the covers available and descriptions. 




 I like how even the Page with the Book of the Dead checklist doesn't even mention Legends of the Geomancer, considering its release is a sort of order incentive that goes along with Book of the Dead.

 All I know is I am going to be broke after all the issues for it releases. 




 Graphic India on 7/29. And turns out I was looking at a variant release amount 




 It is going to be a 1000 copy print tho :( So better pre-order soon. 




 Grant Morrisons 18 Days #1

Star Trek meets Green Latern

Godzilla in Hell

Book of Death Event from Valiant

And have already Pre-Ordered a copy of Legends of the Geomancer.

 An excellent watch. A friend suggested it and I loved it. 




 We want a Lucifer show, but not *this* Lucifer show. 




 Not really. Particularly because that wasnt the last movie I saw him in. 




 I found it interesting. 




 No voting today in my suburb. Oh well. Good luck everyone else. 




 I just finished reading Jupiter's Legacy. I just got to say I am glad I didnt start the series when it was first published. The wait would have been unbearable. It is just such a great story.

Also watched first two seasons of Orphan Black and throughly enjoyed it. 




 You are right. We need more Captain Carrot. 




 Well...uh...death finds a way. 




 Wow. Just wow. i heard of this happening before.

How do you even get an explicit label on an INSTRUMENTAL album? That is a feat in and of itself...I mean whoever decided to give it an explicit label was surely thinking, "This music is so 'out there' that no 'normal' person would think to make it sound the way it does."

I wonder if there is a list of instrumental albums that have explicit warnings on them. 




 I figure it is just promotional and he will likely not be in the movies covered in tattoos. 




 The ending was meh at best.  




 Is there a website where you can keep track of your collection? Bonus points if it suggests builds. 




 Went to my main LCS and then one across town that opened an hour later.

Picked up Divergence, Avengers, Secret Wars, Hatter M, Doctor Who, Attack on Titan, Fight Club, Legendary Preview, Dark Circle and of course Valiant 25th. At my main they also had 2 free gaming cards from a selection.

My main had a 25% off sale and I got a Buddy Christ from Dogma Bank and a Munchkins Deluxe set. 




 I believe she said it while honking the horn. 




 You listed most of them, but:

Dream's Mask, Lucifer's Wings and Phantom Stranger's Coin Necklace. 




 We find ouy early May if the show gets renewed. Meanwhile go stream the whole first season now that it is available. 




 They changed the movie title when it was still in theatres. They sent a new poster and everything to put up.

 Is there a maxim number a quests you can have at once? 




 Good to know. Thanks. 




 This is good to know. Thanks. 




 Wait...you cam re-roll your daily quest? 




 Here is a comment I had on a previous discussion on it:

And I figure with the recent news confirming Bloodshot movies people will read The Valiant, which has Geomancer as a prominent figure. Thus leading to more people wanting to read more, i.e. when they google Geomancer I am sure this book will pop up. 




 We ever going to get Biomotor Unitron? 




 Does this mean I can relive or redo three years? If so yes. 




 Back in my day Batman had nipples! 




 The movie was really well built. So this is looking promising. 




 Just wow. Wondering how this is going to end. Since he seems to have so much power will he give it all up to stay on that last page? 




 [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/valiant/comments/33b8r6/valiant_wants_as_few_people_as_possible_to_read/.compact) is a post on /r/valiant.

Basically it is going to be sent out to LCS that order the Book of Death Event, but as an order incentive. And by the sounds of it there aren't going to be a ton of copies.

And I figure with the recent news confirming Bloodshot movies people will read The Valiant, which has Geomancer as a prominent figure. Thus leading to more people wanting to read more, i.e. when they google Geomancer I am sure this book will pop up. 




 All I know is I'm starting to save up to try and snag a copy of the Legend of the Geomancer when it comes out. Order Incentive only comic after Bloodshot Movie hype leading people to read The Valiant...yea it is gonna cost a pretty penny. 




 No one can agree on which tie ins to get. At $4 each, most cant exactly get them all. 




 Nice to see Valiant with 2 of their 3 books in the top 10 this week. 




 With the Hyacinth Macaw as a special Legendary.  




 Been curious about the Atlantis. 




 "If enough of us dream, if a bare thousand of us dream, we can change the world. We can dream it anew!"
￼

"Little one, I would like to see anyone — prophet, king or God — persuade a thousand cats to do anything at the same time."

Both from my favorite issue of Sandman. #18 A Dream of a Thousand Cats. 




 The fact it has a question make...I just dont even know how to start comprehending that. 




  Dont forget Poison Ivy! What kind of enemy needs an Avatar, Atlantean, a Demon, and a Plant Woman to defeat it? 




 Are you familiar with Pally decks at all? I posted one to get some feedback. 




 Why not Ivar #4? 




 So I've hand a decent run with [this](http://www.hearthpwn.com/deckbuilder/paladin#23:1;29:2;158:2;191:2;206:1;250:1;260:1;265:1;293:2;350:1;355:1;394:1;414:1;422:1;463:1;577:1;642:2;657:1;12181:1;12223:1;12244:1;12257:1;12280:1;14435:1;14454:1;) paladin deck. Usually a good 3-5 win streak in early ranked and casual. Was wondering if anyone can suggest some changes in it to round it out better. 




 Thanks! 




 Am I correct in thinking you should disenchant every card after your second one in you collection from buying packs (After 1 if Legendary)? 




 Turn off all possible battery drains, wifi (if you dont mind data usage), NFC, Bluetooth, background apps, screen brightness, etc. . .I'm on an M8 and I last several hours before needing to recharge.

 Animal Man, Swamp Thing, Frankenstein Agent of Shade, and then Amethyst. Some kind of over arching story where Shade is wanting to control the Red/Green, ushering the need for a new Avatar of each, following with Frank going against the Avatars while slowly learning the truth about Shade's plans. Finally leading us to Amethyst showing Frankies exactly why Shade is bad. 




 TFW "way back" is 2011. . . 




 Meh I get to see them all for free anyways. Sometimes early at that. . . 




 Its not a behind the scenes look per say. It is a photo of Leto showing showing someone a picture of himself as the Joker on his phone. Can barely see it at all. 




 Anyone got a mirror? 




 August? 




 Salted Caramel vodka is good enough for me. Stuff is delicious with apple juice. 




 MPAA definitly has the tools to figure out which theatre is being recorded. 




 Digital format does indeed use a "key" file. Usually it is just for features, but occasionally trailers need a key too (mostly high profile trailers such as Hunger Games). 

If I understand right, the MPAA can figure out exactly which theatre a recording is from by applying some kind of filter to a certain frame of a feature. 

I would imagine the BvS trailer would have a key, at least for the Premier version, and chances are that if the DC cares enough the theatre this one is recorded in can be in trouble. 




 Salem I think I would enjoy. 




 -Yet ANOTHER Award for Neil Gaiman this year. Is he THE Author of 1991?

-Check out my awesome Cosplay of Death from Sandman. 




 My LCS screwed up my pull last month and I never got Valiant #4, hopefully they have that still when I pick stuff up tomorrow. 




 Another week where I am only getting 1 or 2 from the top ten. What is up with that? 




 Pretty much yea. 




 I mean you can always get a refund juat saying, "Something came up I need to go" 




 Outcast 




 I see it mentioned a decent amount on here. The reason I mentioned these two were mainly the subscription services offered to be able to catch up fairly close to current issues. 

While Image does have many good series, practically none are in the same universe, which some people like to have in their different series they are reading. 




 Well check out Marvel Unlimited. It has most issues from a couple months back and further. (EDIT: apparently you can use the promo code Star Wars to get a free month)

Valiant was revived a couple years back and most people that have read their titles enjoyed them. You can find a good amount on Scribd. 




 Wow really? 




 Cinemark Legacy in Plano had the Barco Escape for Maze Runner. No telling if they will bring it back for Star Wars. 




 Excellent. 




 Please be there Thursday...

 Well it isnt really twice in a row since Avengers 2 comes out first. . . 




 Lollipop has finally been rolled out to ATandT's HTC One M8. For those of you that have been waiting like me. . . 




 So the very last issue of The Names is gonna be $3.99? That's kinda silly. 




 /x/ would go back and videotape Roswell landing. 




 Good catch. I could see them being in financial trouble for what we see in the last episode. 




 Murdock's costume when he was just "The Mask" reminded me of a black Iron First costume somewhat. 




 Sometimes collected editions have cover art and other stuff un it. 




 What incentives do comic bookstores get when you declare them as your place of purchase when you redeem digital codes from Marvel comics? Just wondering. 




 Working a double so havent had time yet to read Savior. . . 




 Well if Killer Mike ever goes Platinum. . . 




 Vol. 2 wasn't entirely forgettable. The cat scene T.T
