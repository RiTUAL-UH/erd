  I can't seem to bring myself to do it. 

Yes, same here. I should send my CVs to every job offers, but I can't. I had a long, horrible work experience (also my first), where I developed really bad anxiety and depression. Now I'm a lot better now, and I'd like to have a job and be independent again, but the anxiety kicks in everytime when I think about it. I'm not stupid either, actually I think these disorders are more common among intelligent people. 

Sorry, I don't have an answer... if I had any, I wouldn't be here. Maybe try meditation and exercise. They helped me with my depression, but didn't cure all of my anxiety.
