 I've thought about that. The word abuse has sprung up a couple of times in my meetings with my councilor. They are convinced that I am verbally abused, I just deny it. I also see myself defending him a lot. For instance, he does have a mood disorder that I knew of previous to my situation, and I was not making sense even to myself. I'm going to sound like an idiot so spare me, but I really like him. He is usually warm and charming, just recently not so much. Which is probably why the situation hurt me more. If I could stop liking him I would, but for me that's really hard
