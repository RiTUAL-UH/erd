 Why not check out the Special Olympics site? They might have some good ideas :-) 




 I thought I was driving a car through the hospital. Changing gear, using the horn to get other people off the road. Apparently it was pretty funny for the guy pushing my wheelchair.  




 You need to get back into some sort of talking therapy if possible.

You could also try giving yourself time limits for doing things like standing near a window, then an open window, then by the door, then with the door open, then just outside. Slowly build up your confidence in getting out of the place when you really don't want to?

Sending internet hugs to you, I know that feeling all too well x 




 It is also good for applying after having a tattoo to reduce swelling (apparently) 




 Ouch :-) 




 Colorado is currently $3.35/gallon where I live. I can't math for you :(

 Good job I am seeing my therapist Thursday too! :-) 




 And that is why I cannot watch this film with my kids. The anxiety I felt from that scene was overwhelming. 




 Thank you. I have had panic attacks previously, but these seem to be longer and more subtle than the panic rushes I have had before. I am still getting the intense panic 'rushes' but also an ongoing sense of panic and dread that is lasting for hours, but at slightly lower levels than regular panic attacks.
I try to regulate my breathing, and I use the relaxation techniques that my therapist taught me. Unfortunately, because I have some agoraphobic issues, going for a walk is not always an option. I will try the positive reinforcement though. 




 My anxiety is bad at the moment.

So bad it has morphed back to panic attacks, trying to hide from the world, physical symptoms (stomach issues, headaches).

I am so tired from trying so hard not to let this ruin my life, but every time I think I have a handle on it, it all just creeps back in, worse and worse every time.

I am going through some shitty stuff at the moment, husband has told me, but not yet decided, that he may or may not want to stay married, living 4000 miles from friends and family, kids being 4 and 7 years old and acting accordingly, just had fairly heavy surgery and also trying to work full time.

I am trying to stay positive and remember that 'this too shall pass' but right now I want to get up, walk out and not come back.

But I won't because that voice of responsibility, and owing it to everyone to make it ok, in my head wont let me. 




 Could have been a misstype for BPD? Bi-Polar Disorder. 




 Thank you :-) 




 My husband did this to me 8 weeks ago, just before my birthday. Out of nowhere, a total suprise to me. We have two young kids and now nothing will ever be the same again.

Believe me, I know how it feels to be on the recieving end of this. I wish I could tell you it gets easier, but as I am only at the beginning of sorting this out in my head it really isn't at the moment.  




 Yeah, I am stuck in that place right now. I know the trigger, but I cannot do anything about it in this state of mind. I am sitting here hiding from the world and swinging between wanting to call my Dr for a med evaluation and not wanting to speak to anyone at all. 




 Hi :-) Feeling ok thanks, still bruised and a bit swollen, but I did go back to work already which may not have been the most sensible choice! Xx 




 Hi! Thanks for asking :-) I am feeling much better thanks, very bruised and tired, but only 12 day post surgery so it is to be expected! Going back to work this week may have been a mistake though, but I was bored! Xx 




 I am not sure what made me smile more about this photo, his little face peeking out the window, or him being called Spanky :-) 




 Um, why is this tagged NSFW? Or am I missing something here? :-) 




 Thanks, I wouldn't want to go through it again, but if I could have a similar team I know it would be ok :-) 




 Thank you! It went as well as it could have and they identified the cause of the pain and fixed it. Just in a lot of post-surgical pain today, very bruised and swolled but glad it should all be over now :-) 




 Thanks :-) She is loving me! 









 Turns out I have a twisted fallopian tube and scar tissue around the ovary. Makes me feel much better knowing I was actually in pain rather than it being in my head as one person suggested in other thread I was writing on! :-) 




 Thanks :-) Just very swollen and bruised now, but on Dilauded tablets which are really helping! 




 It went fine thanks, had to have the ovary removed. The anaesthitic was fine. Ask for a premed and it will really relax you. Also ask for the iv anaesthitic as it is way less scary than the gas mask. Hope it all goes ok for you xxxx 




 Thank you :-) 




 It was ok, very anxiety inducing but I tried to control my breathing etc. There was pretty much always someone in the room with me doing stuff so I wasnt in my own to long to start my mind racing.

Ended up having an overy removed, should know more/why once I have spoken to y surgeons asistant.

On lots of painkillers. Had some good sleep on them which is nice. 

Thank you for your support and internet hugs :-) 




 Thanks :-) 




 Thank you :-) 




 I have a nausea patch which has been great. They gave me a premed in the or and i fell asleep laughing at my surgical team! 




 Thank you :-) Got lots of offers for help and cooking which is nice :-) 




 Hope you are all healed now xx 




 It was pretty good, i fell asleep lauging :-) 




 Thanks :-) 




 Ended up having an ovary removed. CT and untrasound are great, my own Dr told me there are several things that cannot be picked up by those tests. Last year they discovered that when standing,  a cyst on my overy was pullin it into tortion, but when i layed down for the scans it moved back it to its proper place and looked normal. 




 Thank you :-) 




 Thank you :-) 




 Thanks :-) 




 Thank you! You must have dealt with abdo pain as not many people do realise how it affects everything - including walking! :-) 




 Thank you :-) 




 Thank you. The waiting is horrible, especially as I am scheduled for early afternoon! 




 Thank you. I am looking forward to the possibility of no more pain! 




 Aww :-) 




 Thank you :-) 




 Thank you. I think I will be working on my breathing all morning! :-) 




 Thanks :-) 




 It sure does suck :-) 




 Thanks :-) 




 Thank you :-) 




 I will try my breathing exercises. I am not very good going under and tend to remain concious until I feel my breathing stop. I know it is not actually stopping, and that there is a team there to keep me alive, but it feels as though I am suffocating as I go to sleep. I usually come round pretty agitated - I once punched the nurse as I had no idea where I was or who was in my face :-( 




 Thank you :-) 




 Thank you :-) 




 Thanks :-) 




 Thank you :-) 




 Thank you. Yes, that is pretty much what I am scared of. I have improved a lot though with my 'worst-case-scenario-itis'  because I no longer actively avoid car trips to keep out of accidents :-) 




 Thank you. I have had similar surgery before to remove an ovarian cyst. But as the cannot identify the exact cause of my pain right now, they are doing the exploratory to try and find if there is a cyst hiding, adhesions, or something else going on. I have given her permision to do what is needed once she is in there. I was sterilized last year, so there will be no really big issues if for example an ovary needs removing. I think it is fear of the anaesthetic and not having control, as well as not knowing the outcome until I come round. 




 Thanks :-)
 




 I am having an exploratory laparoscopy tomorrow to try and find the cause of intense abdominal pain that I have been having for a month now. 

I hate having general anaesthetics, I get very anxious and scared and my worst case scenario thinking comes out in full force.

I am struggling to stay calm about it tonight. Even though I know it is a relatively minor procedure, they will not know what they need to do to resolve any problems until they are in there.

I know my surgeon and trust her, but it is still scary to me and I am going over all the things that could go wrong in my head. It is not helping that I am having to take strong painkillers and they are clouding my ability to process my thoughts logically.

I am going to be a nervous wreck going in there, and last time I remember crying as they put me under because I was so scared that I was never going to wake up again.

So I am feeling miserable and in pain and just looking for a bit of support and sympathy :-(


**edit** So I am home safe and sound, but minus one ovary. I will find out more tomorrow when my surgeon cals. Thanks for all the hugs and comments of to take my mahooosive painkillers now xxxx


**edit** **2** so it was a twisted fallopian tube abd scar tissue surrounding the ovary. No wonder it hurt!! 




 I want to be made into a diamond, set in a ring, and passed down through the generations of my family when they marry. 




 Not today I assume :-) 




 Now I am sad :-( 




 Dammit I need one of those! I would never be sad again! 




 I just wanted to send you an internet hug. Well done :-) 




 Me too 




 Thank you :-) 




 Thank you 




 I am realising more and more how he is just like a teenager. And he is trying to make me feel bad for doing what needs to be done. I am not going to let him do that. He ended the marriage. He has to deal with the pain he is causing himself. 




 Thank you. 




 I know it is going to suck for them. I also went through divorce as a kid. That is why I am trying hard to keep things civil between us.

I want my daughter to grow up seeing how imoortant it is to have self respect and self love. 




 Yes, they are certainly his! And I am done running around after him. 




 I saw my therapist today and we talked about the manipulation. She has given e good guidelines to go by and I agree with her when she says that I no longer have an obligations to him. He has no right to expect anything from me now. He ended the marriage, he has to deal with the consequences. I am not bending over backwards to make it all alright for him anymore. 




 I know. He just wants the benefits of a wife and mother without the responsibility of a partner and kids. There is no way I am staying on a 'friendship' basis as he wants. Neither me or the kids deserve that. 




 Thankfully our son is probably too young to remember this in the future, but I am going to make suremy daughter grows up knowing that it is important to be in a relationship where you are valued and appreciated.
