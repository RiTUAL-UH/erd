 Thank you for the offer! I'm not able to send you my resume tonight but I would really appreciate feedback if I can shoot you a PM tomorrow! 




 I've really been considering this but I guess my fear is that I'm soon not going to be able to afford therapy without a paying job, but I could absolutely volunteer and have a part time job so it's something I will absolutely look into!
