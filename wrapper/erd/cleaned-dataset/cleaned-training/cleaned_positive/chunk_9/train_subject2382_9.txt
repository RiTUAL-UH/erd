 Could have, would have, should have... 




 I think your math is wrong since you didn't add in the fact that trading up battle scarred weapons cannot give you a minimal wear or higher quality weapon. The max quality you can get from battle scarred is field tested which has been proven here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=420402033

In which case the chance for getting a profitable pink skin in the Winter Offensive case [ST] by using only battle scarred ST's is 3/8 instead of 9/13.

However i don't really know if or how much throwing in a higher quality skin will change the chances to get something better than field tested. 
 




 This is what i want to know too. Acestream was so damn stable for the last race. 




 had the exact same average after 5 tries. 207 ... i've never played cs ever though so i don't think it matters
