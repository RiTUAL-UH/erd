 Can you explain to me how f(1001)= 1/1 ?? I'm very confused. 




 Lol, I'm shocked at how many people didn't get this one right... Unless you're a freshman, I'd be concerned. 




 I don't know if I'd say a fuckton, but maybe like ten or less. A lot, but not a preposterous amount. 




 No, simultaneously was an option, but that is used with the plural. For example: "We did two **things** at the same time." "We did one thing **at the same time** we did the other." It does not make sense to say, "We did one thing **simultaneously** as we did the other," or something to that effect. 




 Haha, I got you, Mix. 




 I laughed my ass off reading this. Thank you.

 It's kind of like a piece of paper. From one angle, completely blatantly obvious. From another, practically invisible. Notice how the brick wall in the background moves throughout the pictures. 




 Yes!! 




 As a Catholic, that's a pretty dumb, ridiculous story. 




 I was shocked to see how amazing you look. You are simply stunning!! Congrats on your recovery! 




 Awesome, thank you. 




 Hi there,

I have a question about annulments. If a couple has sex during their marriage but later get their marriage annulled, is that considered premarital sex / sinful?

God bless. 









 I found it on Twitter. I had never seen it on Reddit prior to this. 









 just changed my flair to 16. hmu 




 Thanks! 




 Thanks for pointing that out. Right now I am using Covergirl's 3-in-1 foundation. 




 Thank you for the suggestions! 




 Wow, thank you so much! I appreciate this a lot! 




 This is great! Thank you so much! 




 I'm moisturizing as much as I can, thank you. 




 Thanks for the tip. 




 I use a matte powder. The foundation I'm using right now really clings to dry patches and it drives me crazy. Plus, Accutane is known for making skin dry because it reduces the oil that the oil glands produce. 




 Hello lovelies,

So I started [Accutane](http://www.drugs.com/accutane.html) almost a week ago and my skin is already changing. I used to have the most oily skin (seriously, SO oily). Now my skin is starting to become dry. I am still oily but I have a lot of dry patches. Supposedly, my skin is going to be super dry in a few weeks.

That being said, I am totally lost as to what to do for my foundation now. I am so used to my oily skin that I just about know nothing about makeup for dry skin! So I'm hoping that you all can help me out. I am a teenager, so I'm on a budget and prefer drugstore products, but any suggestions will help. Also, I wear medium-full coverage foundations.

Thank you all so much! xo

TL;DR: I need suggestions for makeup (esp. foundation) for dry skin. 




 So I haven't even visited this subreddit since I reset my badge, and here I am at 44 days. It's not my longest streak, but I'm proud. I feel like this was my biggest goal: to be able to control myself to the extent that I wouldn't need to even worry about it. I think I've only had thoughts about relapsing somewhere between 1 and 5 times this past month and a half. Today, I'm proud of myself. I may not be perfect, but dammit I have self control.

Stay strong, you guys. One day hardmode will be easier than you ever dreamed. 




 You are so pretty. 




 On Facebook. Not Reddit. 




 Thank you so much for your comment. I'll definitely give this a try. 




 Wow, that's really good insight. Thank you. 




 Yeah, I didn't expect you to be a giant or anything. I was more just curious. Plus it would have given me a chuckle if you were really short. 




 You are so sweet, thank you so much. I'm kind of afraid to talk to my parents. Whenever my sister has they try to convince her to quit something but I don't want to quit anything. I think they are aware that I am stressed but they have no idea to what degree. I don't even know how I would bring it up without upsetting them.

Again, thank you. I really appreciate your kind words. 




 How tall are you? 




 Dammit high school sucks. I know that seems like no big deal to a lot of people, but I just feel so damn run down. No matter what I do I can't seem to get anything done. I don't get enough sleep, I don't get all my work done and I'm just so damn done with dealing with all this. It's only my sophomore year and I just want to sink into the floor. There are things I love like choir and dance team and musical but when it comes to actual classes I just want to lay in bed and cry. No kidding, all I want to do is sleep but I can't. All I can do is cry about it. I have two and a half years left and I feel so miserable. Why the hell is this so hard? I constantly feel like I'm letting someone down and my life is so full of stress I could explode. I cry all the time because I'm just so tired. Everyday I have commitments. Also, I live 45 minutes away from my school if there's no traffic, so I spend 1 1/2 hours on the road a day at the very least. I just want to relax. I want to catch my breath, sleep,  get my work done, and start again. I just want to hit pause. It's 8 pm right now and I can barely keep my eyes open because I'm so tired. And I keep getting sick because I never get any actual sleep and then I end up getting even more behind. And whenever I actually get a few hours off, I automatically try to relax because I have so much anxiety but then I find myself falling behind again. I have so many anxiety attacks because I just can't live the way I want to. There are things I want to do but my classes are holding me back. I know what I want to do with my life and barely any of my classes matter at all in the field or in my life. Like, what the hell am I doing this for? And I *have* to get good grades or else I won't be able to go to college but oh my gosh I just don't care anymore. I mean, I care about getting an education but damn why does this f***ing number have to determine so much of what I do in my life. Why can't I be happy right now? I know soon enough I'll be out of high school and maybe I'll be able to breathe and sleep and get over my anxiety but damn why can't my life be like that now. I just sit in my room and cry all the time because I just can't handle it. I'm crying right now because it's just so hard. I know that it's going to get better but why does it have to be so hard just so that I can get a diploma?

I'm aware that this is some pretty petty rambling, but I just needed to get it off my chest. 




 I agree. Miracles Whip is one of the worst things ever. 




 My dad used to shower me... I don't want to talk about it. 




 I LOVE IT! 




 (We're siblings!) 




 Go. 




 Pursue this. You are amazing. 




 Damn. You have some serious talent there, girl. You are beautiful. 




 Yeah, I'm pretty sure that would have ended horribly. 




 I'm literally staring at this picture and I can **NOT** tell that you are wearing makeup!! You are a god. 




 To be honest, I have no idea how I didn't notice... I think they went in one on top of the other, but I'm not really sure. I'm still pretty shocked by it. 









 I always love seeing your posts. You look fab! 




 I called and when I finally got an answer, they asked for my name. I immediately hung up. 




 All the lines are busy... ): 




 I feel you. 




 Well, I know nothing about sketching, but it looks amazing so far!! 




 In the BBC article linked by /u/trewq321 , he does say he is eager to do some public speaking again and would love to speak about anything... Interesting... 




 I can understand where you get that, but I don't think it is. The person feeling upset obviously just needs some time to reconcile with what is going on. Once they get their fill of the nest, they'll come out to work it out. 




 Your friend should definitely talk to his/her professor or a school counselor (if you have one). I'm sure some kind of understanding can be reached. 




 This is definitely the most accurate that I've seen. Very well done. 




 My guess would be that they said something like "We'll briefly cover your childhood homelessness," but he wasn't expecting "How tough was it? Wasn't it awful? What was it like? Can you shed a few tears for us please?" I don't know, but that's my take on it. 




 Yeah, the interview you referenced is pretty obviously fake. I didn't watch it until the end, but it's from the same account as the original and says some very obviously untrue things. It says very early on that it hit a million views in about ten hours. It does not have a million views... I'm not 100% sure about the video being fake (though I have a hard time believing that it's true), but for sure the interview is. 




 This is absolutely fantastic!! You did a beautiful job! 




 I found this strangely powerful. Thanks for sharing. 




 I think I'm the only one in Texas happy about this right now. I broke my nose and had surgery today. Now I don't have to miss all the stuff I had planned for tomorrow and Saturday! 




 I'm sorry to hear that. Best wishes to you as well. 




 Will do. 




 Hi there.

I broke my nose just over a week ago. I went to the doctor on Monday and found out that it is in fact broken, and I'm going to need surgery to put it back into place before the bones heal too much to move them. 

It's not a big deal (they're not even cutting my open, but they do need to put me under), but I need the prayers. No one, as far as I know, is praying for me. That's fine, it's not a major operation or anything like that, but I'm still having surgery and I'm nervous. I really need all the prayers I can get, if not just to calm my nerves.


Thank you all so much; I love and appreciate all of you. God bless.

P.S. My name is Nicole if you want to call me by name.

**TL;DR** I broke my nose and am having surgery. I would really appreciate some prayers.

**Update 1:** I'm about to go into surgery, and I feel very at peace. Thank you all so much who prayed; it definitely made a difference.

**Update 2:** I'm now out of surgery and doing really well. The doctor said my nose was broken worse than she originally thought, but the surgery still went very well. I can already breathe through my nose better and I feel very blessed to have this over with and be doing so well! Thank you all so much; you are amazing!

 Good for you for going with such a bold look! Next time, I would choose a bit of a richer red: a bit darker and, I guess the only way I can say it is thicker and more opaque. 




 I'll definitely look into that. Thanks so much. 




 Wow, never would have tried that. Thanks! 




 Hi there. Last night I beat up my nose real bad and now the entire right side of my nose and my right eye are swollen up like a balloon. Right now there's only a little bit of redness in those areas so it'll be easy enough to cover up with concealer, but eventually it's gonna turn into a real deep black and blue. Also, if there's anything I can do to distract from or some how cover up the swelling, it would be much appreciated.

Thanks! xoxo 




 Thanks so much! 




 No worries, this gave me a bit of a chuckle. 




 I don't think that's necessary. I've received a lot of help and inspiration here despite this. Also, a female NoFap would be so much smaller, we wouldn't receive nearly as much support. 




 Haha, I got that after I posted this thread. 




 I'm glad I could help(: 




 The mental side effects, yes, are very much the same. I don't suffer from all of them, but depression, anxiety, easily distracted, disinterest, etc. As for men, some women experience a lot of them, some only a few. I personally suffer anxiety and depression that sometimes lead into things like disinterest, etc.

Obviously, the physical effects are different. Overuse can lead to dryness, itchiness, elongated labia minora (vaginal lips), loss in sensitivity, etc. I haven't really researched this, but these are things that I have experienced. 




 Yeah, that's true, but at least there's the option. 




 Just got mine(: I'm glad you appreciate it! 




 Haha(: Well I think addiction to / problems with fapping for women (schlicking, I guess, but that sounds gross) is definitely less prevalent than it is in men. Obviously, women don't have to worry about ED, low sperm count, etc., but I have noticed in myself that my labia minora (the vaginal lips, I suppose) become elongated and the vagina can become dry and itchy, which can possibly leading to things like UTI or yeast infection. It also decreases sensitivity by a large degree. Again, this isn't something I've researched, but something I have observed.

I think that most women do masturbate, they are just less prone to addiction. Many people say that's because women are more interested in the love and connection than just the sensation, which is often what men are looking for. This can lead into women caring less and less about connection and becoming addicted or they get bored and choose to never do it, or at least not that often. But really, as far as I know, women with fapping issues are definitely in the vast minority.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I hope this was helpful! 




 I hope you know how childish and inappropriate this is. 




 Okay, well thank you. I just wanted you to know that it didn't really upset me, I just felt like, again, it needed to be said. Have a good day(: 




 Thanks(: I'll definitely look into that. 




 You're obviously going through something tough in your life right now, so I'm just going to ignore you. I don't know why you'd choose to follow a teenaged girls reddit account and post rude things about her, but sounds like a cry for attention to me... Maybe you should be more concerned with yourself than a stranger. 




 I understand it, but I've been here for maybe a year and I felt like it needed to be said. Now I said it, and people helped me out. No big deal. 




 I quit because of my religion, not for attention... Hearing about what masturbation does to people through this community made me take the plunge, but that was not my reason. Also, I didn't claim to be an addict. Masturbation is more of a vice to me than an addiction. Don't pretend to know me. 




 Just found that. Thanks so much! 




 Thank you very much(:
