 Some of us have friends who all bring instruments to the party. 




 The guy that doesn't quite know how to play his guitar.  




 Or sing out. 




 FOR EVERY BEAR THAT EVER THERE WAS WILL GATHER TODAY TOGETHER BECAUSE **TODAY'S THE DAY THAT TEDDY BEARS HAVE THEIR PICNIC**.         
I have a problem. 




 The bluegrass community has pretty much banned Wagon Wheel. Everyone hates it now. Fun fact.      
Also Midnight Special and Bad Bad Leroy Brown go over great. 




 No but opium is. 




 Thank you.  




 Well thank you.        
I generally do. Actually I rarely wash let alone condition my hair. I do rub myself down in coconut oil before I get out of the shower which has been helping my skin. 




 As someone with chronic pain I wasn't that pleased. 




 I didn't care for it. A bunch of people with chronic pain were excited about it but it ended up poorly portraying people like us. So I may be bias. She did a good job acting when it comes to being in pain, but at the same time real people with constant pain become good at hiding it. So it seemed a little dramatic to me. I guess that works for the majority demographic though.  




 That looks like a collage I would have made in high school to make my art teacher uncomfortable.  




 Like the aches you get with a fever? I get that a lot.  




 I'm pretty sure I have mastocytosis. It can be inconvenient for me at times but it's not much of a problem for me. At least not compared to the other stuff. Though it varies from case to case like EDS.       
My hands and feet swell sometimes. My face will get hot and flushed. And I get a few hives here and there. One time I had them really badly for three months and in that time things like my lips would swell up and I looked like some kind of plastic surgery nightmare. Or my feet were so swollen i had to crawl to the bathroom. That was way back in high school and we never figured out why it happened until now but it hasn't happened since.        
For the most part it isn't that bad, I do also have a dumpy immune system though.  




 The symptoms for mastocytosis are confusing. My hands and feet swell and turn red often, sometimes because of exercise or having a drink, other times for no reason. I also had severe hives for three months one time. It was insane. I have also always had a crappy immune system. So I assume I have mast cell disease. It's sort of the least of my problems though.  




 I have messed around with silks before and they gave me major bruises. I used to be a contortionist and performed with a sideshow as well as playing wash tub bass with a band. Then I started feeling awful and figured out that the hypermobility is part of the problem. Which led me to realize I have EDS as well as some of the conditions that come with it. I can still play my ukulele banjo but I have osteoarthritis in my hands so that won't last long.  




 Sometimes were not. But this sub really is full of some major bad asses. 




 You actually weren't the person I had in mind. And the church thing is a no go for me. 




 I have a slurry of physical and mental health problems. I am 23 and can't go to the grocery store and take a shower in the same day.       
Let's see if I can remember most of them.         
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteoarthritis, dysautonomia, POTS, hyperthyroidism, TMJ, and fibromyalga.       
Then I have depression of course and have had a couple bouts of psychotic depression, severe anxiety which is amplified by my thyroid problem. And I am possibly bipolar.       
Generally I am a really easy going person but with all my health problems I become pretty useless at times.       
My physical health is pretty bad due to the ehlers-danlos. In a literal sense I am actually falling apart.  




 "Will you marry me?"       
Not just any guy but a specific one. 




 Even though I have good health insurance I can't get any doctors to treat my chronic pain because so many people have abused the system.  




 Walking down the street as a kid on Halloween with some friends when lightning struck a telephone pole right next to us.        
 




 Yeah the cheapest surgeon at the cheapest hospital probably isn't a good idea.  




 A picture I took of my friend that makes me laugh every time I scroll past it in my phone. NSFW.

 I actually had to leave my job due to unfortunate health problems. It was a wonderful job though and I am hoping to go back. I worked at a dog rescue. So there was about 200 dogs at the warehouse I worked at. Most of the people that do the grunt work like myself are dirty punk kids. Having face tattoos is a normal thing there.       
I mostly walked the dogs and had several breaks throughout the day. Being the sick person I am I would take naps on top of the huge pallets of dog food despite there being tourists walking around looking at the dogs. It is a fairly laid back place so long as you are doing your job.        
Dirtiest job I have ever had. Also the best. Those dogs are hard to not fall in love with. Working with people who are also grossly obsessed with the dogs is a bonus.         
That specific rescue also happens to be somewhat famous so it was interesting trying to avoid cameras and super fans. 




 I am from Washington state. I heard that our accents sound "the most intelligent" so many news reporters tend to be from WA.  




 I am way late. I don't have anything too extreme, six tattoos, one nipple pierced, vertical labret, both nostrils, and my bridge. My hair is also weird colors and my fashion sense is confusing for everyone (I really love my knit maroon body suit).     
No the bridge piercing does not go through the bone.      
I really really really do not want attention. I look the way I do because it is what I like, I seriously hate all the clothes that would make me look normal. I know I will always get stared at in public and that's fine, but please leave me alone.         
The only time I care for attention from strangers is when I am on a stage actively desplaying myself which I no longer do because I am disabled.       
I just want to live happily ever after with a dozen dogs and my big heavily tattooed mexican boyfriend.  




 My bridge is pierced and people always ask if it is through the bone. Um. No. 




 I got turned down by them. 




 I was seeing pain specialists at UW. Fuck those guys. Just saying. Do not recommend. When their geneticist turned me down they were like "Why do you want a diagnosis so bad anyway? Would that make you feel better?" I still don't know weather or not I have type 4 or just 3. 




 All growing up I did ballet and gymnastics. More recently I was a contortionist. Realizing I can never do that again was hard. But I guess I got over it because before I had time to deal with it my health also caused me to have to leave my job and all the dogs I love that I worked with. Then I left my home, my lover, my step dog, and my life all because I can't take care of myself at 23. So I guess the other things sort of went on the back burner.  




 Thanks. I am just so ready to be past this. 




 Thanks. And yeah. I'm sick of my body.  My joints don't even dislocate. It just hurts all the time. And despite not having been on tramadol for long I am withdrawing. So that's probably why I'm so fucked right now.  




 Thanks.  




 There's just nothing. My tramadol stopped working so I stopped taking. I wasn't on it for very long but it is definitely effecting me coming out of my system. I had weird dreams last night when I finally managed to sleep for a couple hours.  Now I still feel all gross about it. My mom is being awful and it is the worst timing. I just want to go home back to my life. I want to try Lyrica and maybe that will help. I will even try some of the woo woo herbal shit. But I am done trying to get to the bottom of this. My ship is capsizing and I am not going to watch my life sink to the bottom so I can go try and find some mythical mermaid medical treatment. Fuck this. I am done with my health ruining my life. Fuck my health. There is no need for it if I can't have a life anyway. I'm 23 and don't have time for this shit. I need to go back home to my partner and the dogs. I need my life back. I don't care if I have to work covered in braces.       
I haven't always made the best decisions in life, but I at least had decisions to make and usually knew which ones were right. Now I don't even really have any options or they all seem like bad ones.        
This is MY life. I demand the right to fuck it up on my own or have enough control to actually make it work. I'm sick of doctors making it about my depression. Of course I am fucking depressed! Look at this shit! I shouldn't be here!      
If I can find meds that will take the edge off I am just going to suck it up and go back to work. It doesn't matter anymore. I already know what I have to lose and my health is the least of them. 




 Um. Um. Dark green! Do you have any pets? Do you like ice cream? I love ice cream.  




 Sorry I was trying to do the sleep thing and didn't think many people would be interested anyway.

 Louisiana.  




 http://www.vrcpitbull.net/dog/how-you-can-help/donations/ 




 Holy shit yes. 




 http://www.vrcpitbull.net/dog/how-you-can-help/donations/ 




 Yes. 




 Seriously. I mean I do enjoy browsing this sub and all but the animal stuff is different. That dog can have a future but she is being given a home from a non profit business. That business relies on donations to keep going and already has 500 dogs to feed, bed, clean, walk, love, and pay for all their vet bills. And most of them have heartworm which has to be treated but it's not cheap. The dog I am getting from there is actually still there only because she is on heartworm treatment.  




 Well I'm glad someone likes it. 




 She will be fine I bet. The rescue that has her is really good.  




 She is still a puppy so whoever had her didn't have her for too long either way.  




 I just saw that on Facebook. I used to work at the place that rescued her before I got sick. People that do that shit are the worst. I was already having a bad day but when I saw that I was immediately in tears. That rescue has a bunch of dogs with scars from embedded collars. That is a whole different level of fucked.       
Her name is Frozen, if anyone is interested in donating to go towards her surgery I can give you the information.  




 Ugh. I know how you feel. I am 23 and can't do shit because of my pain. I have ran through all of those same thoughts. And I am having a bad pain day as well so there's about a five minute pause between each sentence. It really is awful, I would deal with it had I at least been able to get through a decent chunk of my life. I'm sorry you're stuck here with us, but honestly this sub has done a lot for me when I am at my worst. If you want to talk to someone your age that knows exactly what you're going through feel free to hit me up any time.         
I was planning on saying other things... but I don't know what happened. But uh. Yeah. 




 Maybe it was the other way around. This may sound weird, but I was actually born with no facial piercings. And yet there has never been a shortage of weirdos in my life.  




 Thanks. I was actually planning to get a lawyer after the first time.  




 Thanks. I was actually planning to get a lawyer after the first time.  




 Yeah I was having a weird moment but sometimes those work out. 




 Nice. 




 Hi new friend. What's your favorite color?  




 Haha. Yeah. I just haven't done well in texas. 




 Thanks. Texas doesn't like my kind too much though. Haha. 




 Ugh that sucks.  




 Like a small face and a pointy little chin. And I am mixed race.  




 I have that same problem. Not because I am super attractive, but because I am fairly attractive and dress differently. So I get the creepy looks as well as the dirty ones for looking like a heathen. Which I am. 




 This is actually one of the biggest things I have a problem with. I can hardly go outside without being acknowledged by creeps. I hate cat calls so much. Sometimes I pick up rocks in case I need to throw them. 




 Dude. Older Mexican guys. At least they are all romantic about it. Still creepy though. Now I always tell them I already have a Mexican boyfriend.  




 This shit. 




 Dude I have great curves but my boobs kind of suck. I kind of like it. 




 I constantly get approached and I hate it. But I also have strange features so I think I tend to attract the weirdos. 




 It's too soon. We're not ready yet.  




 Same as the guy from the killers I think. 




 My good friend was working as a delivery driver in Seattle. He had a delivery for Nye. When he opened the door he grabbed the package and shut the door in my friends face. My friend knocked again because he needed the papers signed. Nye opened the door and barked about no autographs and my friend hardly had a chance to tell him he just needed the paperwork signed for his job. Nye didn't even apologize or anything.        
It's sad because my friend loved Bill Nye and he is like the sweetest guy ever. 




 Oh yeah. Thanks. I was kinda close. 




 They deserve more. 




 Possibly. I will check it out. Thanks. 




 Jimmy Page being a creep and kidnapping a 14 year old girl and then marrying her.       
But more importantly Bill Nye being a dick. I have heard a few stories but one is from one of my close friends. Not impressed Bill.       
I mean I know he is a scientist and all and being famous sucks. But he made a kids show. My whole generation idolizes him. But no, he has to go shit all over our childhoods.        
But I have also met some pseudo celebrities that are great. Patch Adams (like the Robin Williams film but the guy it's about) is really wonderful. I see him at a festival every year. And the cast from Pitbulls and Parolees are great. Particularly Tia who's life really does revolve around those dogs.          
Edit: Names are hard. 




 Chorizo and eggs over rice with avacado. Could even add some cilantro and lime. That dish is always delicious but I happen to have the almost useless talent of serving food in ways that make it look way more fancy than it is.       
Also I probably have tequila stashed around the house somewhere.  




 This is probably the most likely way to get laid. Besides the roofie guy.  




 Wow. 




 Ah yes. The sexiest of the date foods. 




 So uh. Have any plans tonight?  




 This is the first one that is decent enough that it wouldn't ruin the chances of me sleeping with the cook.        
Maybe I about being picky but I feel like canned corn isn't really going to get me in the mood. 




 Maybe we need to come up with a revised version.  




 I don't know how I would have that much dark shit going on when I was five. But it's not really like that. I have had anxiety attacks which are awful and like that. The dream thing is a completely different flavor of fucked up. That's not what little girls should have going on.       
The dream though actually reminds me of something I heard later on though. I think it was about people in east Germany that lived near the Berlin Wall. The men would begin to dig a hole to tunnel under so they could escape with their families. But they couldn't just have big dirt piles laying around. So every day they would fill their lunch boxes with dirt and dump it at work. Which would end up taking years. I don't even know where I learned that. 




 Stupid body tricks like touching my tongue to my nose and putting my arms in stupid yoga positions. My body does all kinds of weird shit. 




 I had a dream when I was little that I had a house, but for some reason the house was full of mounds and mounds of salt. I don't know why or under what context but I was only allowed to remove one pinch of salt a day.        
It wasn't so much the content of the dream as it was the feeling I had the whole time. It is by far the worst feeling I have ever had in my life and sometimes I almost have flashbacks of it. There are certain things that cause it but one of them is touching one of my pinkys a specific way. I have had pretty severe anxiety most of my life but whatever that is is a whole different level. When it happens I can't get rid of the feeling until it goes on its own.       
I'm not sure if it happened around some traumatic event I don't remember or if it was a fever dream. Maybe both. I know I hallucinate pretty badly when I have fevers. But there is also some suspicion that I have blocked out some kind of trauma from my early years.        
I would like to figure out what the fuck that's about but I sort of figure it will just cause a major nervous breakdown in a decade or so and I will find out then. 




 And then one on you so an alarm sounds if the snail comes with a certain distance.      
Also bellydancers that are also ninjas. 




 That is probably what they have on all their clipboards or some shit.  




 I can get more creative than that. 




 Yes! 




 Hahaha. Actually no my dad is white. My mom is Filipino though.  




 What's the worst thing that could happen? What am I gonna curse you with crippling torturous pain? Oh wait. 




 I kind of want to fight your mom. Or make my mom fight your mom. Instead of like dog fighting we could do underground chronic pain mom fighting.  




 Yeah my dad is the worst with that. I can't eat any kind of sugar around him. I'm 23. He also think I just need to eat a ton of broth and shit because the connective tissue. Um. No. 




 That's blackout. Usually it's a good thing. But in this game you walk away with chronic pain either way...... Soooo.. yeahhhh. 




 Thanks.  




 That's awesome. Happy for you. I am actually lucky enough to have a few close people that are pretty understanding.  




 Haha. I should start mailing people spoons. 




 Hahaha. Seriously. I still feel bad for the starving babies in the Philippines and all but I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FUNCTION LIKE A HUMAN ANYWAY.  As a matter of fact I could actually be doing good thing for the world if I could use my body. I had to quit my job working with rescue dogs in the ghetto. Yes things could be worse. But they could also be better. That would be fucking ideal. 




 Yeah mine just go in and out. I have never had a dislocation that didn't easily go back into place though.  




 Yeah I was planning to. Hopefully that will get me somewhere with that. 




 It's really frustrating.  




 Yeah that's weird.  




 One of them was. He would actually do his fucking hair. My current boyfriend is just kind of obsessive and had a long winded routine he had to do before leaving the house. It includes smoking a bowl and picking everything up off the floor. 




 This whole year I have gone from doctor to doctor trying to get taken seriously. I *think* I finally found a decent GP, I have PT tomorrow for the first time, and I had an appointment with another rheumatologist. Had as in until today when the office called me and dumped me because he doesn't treat EDS.        
I am trying so hard to get better but there's nothing else I can do. I am completely debilitated lately. And to make it worse I have to work somewhere for a few days in a week or so. Which I am stressed about. I am already trying to deal with the fact that I have to work outside in the sun and dust for four days and won't be able to get the proper pain medication. When I already have a hard time putting my hair in a bun.       
I know I need braces for my wrists, elbow, and knees (probably my hips too but I don't feel like looking like fucking buzz lightyear). It is a bummer I couldn't get medical help sooner so I could have things like that by now.       
What is really getting to me is that I feel like I would **really** benefit from forearm crutches. Which is already enough of a bummer on its own but I can't even talk to a doctor about it. I think they would help because my legs get so tired and weak from walking. Not because of dislocations or anything. And the place I have to work has a lot of walking to do.         
To make it worse every time I bring it up to my parents they don't say much and give me a look like I am being dramatic. I think that if I had more support and I could talk to my mom about it I would just end up buying a pair before I have to go work. But without reinforcement I feel stupid about it. It's sort of embarrassing.         
What do you think? Maybe I shouldn't be making such a big deal and wait to see the right doctor? I don't know.  




 Yeah I will probably just stick to the water stuff. I can't hold myself up in warrior pose because I am too weak and shakey and I can't put my weight on my wrists. I can do the one where you lay on your back for 20 minutes though. Hahahaha. 




 Yeah TMJ is fairly common. Mine is very obvious because every time I open my mouth there is a series of crunching and a couple pops. I don't get to eat a lot of things. Hahaha. 




 That's what happens to me. I just realized my 'good' shoulder isn't quite in the socket all the way. Apparently it just lives there.  




 Like the other day. In the past ten months my pain has become crippling. In a week or so I have a festival that I work at every year (I grew up going and it is important to me). I have been stressed out about how I will manage working with all my pain. There is so much walking to to there that it has always been exhausting for me even when I didn't work. So I got to thinking it would be much easier to stand for my five hour shift if I didn't have to walk everywhere. Then it hit me. But I doubt I can make that happen by then. 




 It should. I hate that. The condition I have actually makes me way too bendy so yoga is pretty much the opposite of what I should be doing.  




 Nothing good. But you had fun right?  




 The way doctors. act you would think they know much more about mental health than they do.        
Every time I explain how bad my chronic pain is and how it effects my life I end up crying. Doctors immediately skip over the physical stuff and go straight to asking about my depression. As if that is the most likely cause of my crippling pain. I had to leave my job, home, dogs, boyfriend, and life in general because of my body. I am 23 and can hardly put my hair up. Yeah I'm fucking depressed. I am pretty sure that is a reasonable response to that.  




 Sometimes when someone asks me that and I don't want to talk to them I say "I cried in my bed all day". Hahaha. Sometimes it's half true. But it gets people to back off.  




 I used to get migraines a lot, sometimes they were pretty bad, but would really effect my eyes. Now I haven't had one for a while for some reason and just had headaches most of the time. Now I have hardly get those.       
I have a connective tissue disorder so my neck has always hurt because it's not strong enough to support my head. But it's not as bad as my jaw, hands, elbow, and hips. The only thing that really helps my neck is massage. Even when opiate pain pills take away my pain it gives me a different sometimes worse pain in my neck. 









 Everything is weird. I actually really like body hair on men and women. Armpit hair is the best. I like to bleach mine, I hear that blondes have more fun but I'm not that commited.
