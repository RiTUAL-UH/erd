 Wow. Please don't assume that I'm the only person who lives in this house and that it was my fault the door was left open. Because that wasn't the case.  




 Neighbour's cat 




 Fortunately, she's got all her vaccines up to date!

 Wow. Congrats. First time I've actually said WTF on this subreddit. 
Would not recommend clicking.
 




 Gorgeous eyes!  




 Not being enough.  




 I went to the ER yesterday and am on antibiotics for 10 days! The owners have caged the cat and I'm calling animal control on Tuesday (long weekend).  




 My cat ran to my room for safety and I guess the cat got pissed. I know it sounds unbelievable but it happened. It's not the first time this cat has bitten someone though. She bit her owners and their baby as well.  




 A clown with a syringe.  




 I wish I had a big sister to help me with my first makeup bag! Hope she loves it!
