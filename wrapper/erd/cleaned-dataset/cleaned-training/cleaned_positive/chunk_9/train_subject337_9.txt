 Hey all. I created this to be a place where thin, healthy people can talk about thin people things with other thin people. If anyone actually subs, I'll need a mod team, so there's that.

Share your thin person activities, tips, advice, cool products, etc, and what being a thin person means to you!

Welcome! 









 I can't wait to wake up early and not struggle at all to jog a few miles. Anyone else? 




 Need the link to the petition. 




 Faces were left in, unless it was a minor (which were never posted as the primary focus, but were sometimes in the photo. Their faces were to be blurred or pixelated out.) All other identifying info was washed (name, Tumblr blog URL, Instagram name, etc). No info was left that would have led a reader to the individual's personal or internet existence. This was strictly to *prevent* FPH users going off reddit and trolling someone. It was the opposite, and I'm sharing this in the name of transparency. A more typical scenario is a FPH reader trolling a fat person IRL (Instagram, Facebook, etc) and then anonymously posting about it to FPH, with all identifying info removed. The non-existance of the subreddit won't stop people from posting things on other's Instagram/Tumblr/FB posts; it just takes away the place to share those trollings (if you will).

There was a notable doxxing less than a month ago. Last I followed, the FPH user came close to losing his/her job, and may have since then. All the content from FPH is gone, or I'd share the details for the sake of discussion. 




 Huh. I'd never heard of them before today, but I'll consider this new piece of information. 




 Just like reddit received the strong message from the downfall of Digg? 




 Members of FPH received more IRL consequences than we ever would dish out. I can't speak for asshole individuals (who would be assholes with or without FPH), but the sub as a whole didn't affect anyone IRL. Some of **our members** received death threats, some were severely doxxed (to the point of job loss), etc. 




 I honestly think they only banned the other four subs as a cushion for banning FPH. That's the only explanation that makes any sense to me. 




 F 




 Do you have actual examples of this? Other than people being assholes? Please share them.

If I go walk up to a person on the street and call them a fat piece of shit is that a direct reflection of my involvement with FPH? If I start an Instagram account just to post shitty things on the HAES pages, does that have anything to do me being a member at FPH? No. It doesn't.

So give me an example of when the sub (as a whole, not just one user acting alone) was *directly responsible* for harassment. 




 Not bullshit. Active FPH poster here, and you can downvote me to hell for that all you want, but the mods at FPH took this very seriously. We kept to our own little corner of reddit, despite being brigaded ourselves. Despite receiving death threats in our inbox. Despite some members having their lives completely ruined by doxxers. We were constantly being reminded by the mods about the seriousness of our content getting out of the sub. The mods were always quick to remove posts with identifying information, or posts that promoted brigading or activities outside the subreddit.

Basically, all the things that people are accusing us of doing have been happening **to us** and we don't bitch about it. We just stayed in our corner, with our alternate usernames, laughing at pictures of fat people. 




 Neither ~~is~~ was /r/fatpeoplehate. That's the point. 




 The amount of that that was going on was nothing. Are they going to ban every sub that has a small percentage of readers brigading elsewhere? It has nothing to do with that.

Case in point: remember when /r/androidmasterrace essentially shut down /r/iosmasterrace due to brigading? The reddit admins did basically nothing. It's not about brigading, and don't think for a second that it's not at least 95% about the fat hate.

Second point: One of the other banned subs is /r/hamplanethatred. I'm a *very* active FPH poster and I'd never even heard of that sub. I doubt they had a big hand in brigading anyone, and certainly not as much as some of the other (non-banned) fat hate subs had the potential to do.  




 Good job reddit. You just pissed off a community of over 150,000 users. This will not end well, and I doubt those 150,000 will go down without a fight. 




 Has it gotten you arrested yet? I think that's a more likely outcome. 




 Increased by almost 2 years in just 3 hours. Guys, we're fucked. 




 I was thinking the opening sewers of Oblivion. 




 I wish we could hear how other people sound to themselves. 




 Wait, there are people who don't love Apple? I don't believe you. 




 "Forks are for eating. Tridents are for ruling the seven seas." Boom. Trident superiority. 




 I added the "karma" to the front of it. 




 Grew up in a dressage family. This is the truest statement ever. It's all smiles and happiness at the shows every weekend, but then brutal backstabbing outside of that. My mom is a competition judge and used to be on the board of the dressage association here. She would come home with horror stories from board meetings. 




 Can someone explain what's happening? 




 I could watch this for minutes. 




 It looks more like lumbar hyper-lordosis. Chiropractor could fix that up in a jiffy. And by jiffy I mean about 8 weeks. 




 Well, we're still friends, so probably not a bad life. 




 My high school bf was from Scotland. He'd lost his accent when around his American friends, but whenever his family was together I couldn't understand anything being said. I constantly had to have him translate for me. 




 Now do Pokemon. 




 How did you even bring it up with him that you wanted to do that? I'm always afraid that guys get super freaked out by the more extreme fantasies like this. 




 Do you and /u/TAC_ work at the same place? 




 Strawberries are about 4 calories a piece. So... 50 strawberries. 




 Today's my birthday. I'm 26. This literally happened the day I was born. Every year I see it somewhere in the media. Last year was the worst because it was the 25th anniversary.

Makes me sad (the history, not the fact that it's on my birthday.) 




 Getting hit by insects taught me to wear my jacket when I was a new rider. Had a huge bug hit me in the arm, and I instinctively yanked my hand up and nearly wrecked.

Couldn't imagine getting hit in the face with a bird. 




 Thank you! You're a good person. 




 Am I the only person who didn't get it? 




 Only bots say "SMS" instead of "text". 




 He has one more close parenthesis than open. 




 ...the fuck? 




 My best friend and I have shared many moments of hating on fat people. You may have seen some of our snapchat antics over in FPH. Recently it seems his fat hate is softening.

We were at the grocery store last week and saw that issue of People Magazine with queen whale on the cover. It was next to the "Best Bodies Issue" of some other tabloid. I pointed out how I found that extremely funny, and friend asks "why do you hate her so much?" I gave the schpeel about HAES and the FA movement, things he knows about already. He replied with a sentence so wrapped in fat logic I almost walked out of the store and left him there. He said "But it's not affecting you, why do you care?" I about lost it. I can't believe it.

Have you guys had any shitlord friends get soft? What did you do? 




 And they're so boring. We shouldn't have to settle for rice and beans just because we don't live with other people. I want fancy meals, dammit! 




 Or walk at a normal pace. Should be fast enough to get away. 




 I've been living alone for almost 6 months. I've stopped grocery shopping because everything comes in huge quantites. Everything goes bad before I can eat/cook it. And all the recipes I find are for a family of four. My fridge has some condiments, restaurant leftovers, and beer. It's absurd. 




 You can. Would be easy to set it to remind you when you reach the stop before the one you need. 




 I have a question about sleep studies. I had one done a while ago. At the time, I was bartending so my normal sleep hours were between 4am and noon. For the sleep study, they made me get there at 8pm and had me in bed to fall to sleep by 9pm. They said I would be woken up around 6am. I also was forced to sleep on my back, because of the wires, but I'm a tummy sleeper. Needless to say, I didn't fall to sleep for hours. The nurse was frustrated. I was miserable. The study didn't tell the doctor anything relevant. I'm wondering, is this common practice for running a sleep study? How accurate can the results be if they are forcing you to sleep outside of your normal sleeping patterns? 




 Question, because I'm nosy: do you get any flack for it in public?

I've only ever met one person with noticeable Tourettes. He would yell what sounded like "nnit" every now and then. At first there was the confusion as to why this person was yelling randomly, and then the understanding of the reason. Didn't give it any thought after that, but I can imagine that some people would make a fuss or something. 




 Turning 26 this week. Excuse me while I go to the party store. 




  That's called fat logic

  A medley of various Indian animals mating - in domestic and wild conditions...

 In biology, mating is the pairing of opposite-sex or hermaphroditic organisms for copulation. In social animals, it also includes the raising of their offspring. Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. The two individuals may be of opposite sexes or hermaphroditic, as is the case with, for example, snails.
For animals, mating methods include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes such behaviours as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating domesticated animals and of artificially inseminating them is part of animal husbandry.

 In some terrestrial arthropods, including insects representing basal (primitive) phylogenetic clades, the male deposits spermatozoa on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure. Courtship involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening without actual copulation. In groups such as dragonflies and many spiders, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female (in dragonflies, it is a set of modified sternites on the second abdominal segment; in spiders, it is the male pedipalps). In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its aedeagus, a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a "spermatophore") into the female's reproductive tract.
Other animals reproduce sexually with external fertilization, including many basal vertebrates. Vertebrates (such as reptiles, some fish, and most birds) reproduce with internal fertilization through cloacal copulation (see also hemipenis), while mammals copulate vaginally.

And then there was a very long list of things like "horses breeding hard" and "dog breeding videos up close" which I can only assume were meant to be keywords and hopefully not insight into the sexual preferences of whomever posted the video. 




 That means we can draw on him. 




 Story time!

Once, on the metro, these 4 teenagers were playing some rap songs on a phone, and very loudly rapping all of the lyrics. These were not exactly family-friendly lyrics, and it was after the Cherry Blossom festival, so there were tons of kids on board.

After these teenagers got off the metro, all the adults in the train started talking about it. I've never seen so many complete strangers engaging in one conversation in my life. 




 You are the worst kind of person. 




 They all have smartphones now. Or tablets. Or iPod Touch at the very least. Thankfully they're more disciplined than I imagine the high schoolers are, and they don't take them out in class (very often). 




 I went to try and check Yik Yak once while waiting on my elementary students and was greeted with this lovely message. While annoying, I definitely see why. Fourth graders are brutal. Lets not give them an anonymous, unfiltered voice. 




 I always saw it as normal variance of human personality. But because of social "standards" it's classified as a problem that needs to be fixed.

 Are we still holding to this? What if it never ends? 




 Bats are my favorite animals. I would totally have one as a pet.

 I always liked the idea of being able to pick out what you want to wear and have it printed at home. New clothes every day!

 I finally got my tragus done today. It was way easier than my cartilage and helix piercings. It hasn't hurt at all since the poke: none of that weird heat or soreness or ache. I've pretty much forgotten that it's there. UNTIL I just put my Apple EarPods in, with the speed and force that I typically do. Holy crap, it hurts now.

You guys with piercings that touch your ear buds, what buds do you use? The hard plastic of the Apple ones is not going to fly while this is healing. 




 Are dishtowels not cool enough? 




 I'm pretty sure OP rounded up to the nearest thousand. 




 ... proceed. 




 I can't decide if that's suppose to be a threat or an offer. 




 Second top comment. Did we succeed? 




 I'd swipe right. But don't think for a second that it wouldn't be 100% because of your sweet, sweet karma.
