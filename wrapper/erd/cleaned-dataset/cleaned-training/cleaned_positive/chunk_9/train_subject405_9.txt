 Wow that is awesome I want one now! 




 Hi there, 

I took adderall and started abusing it right away I was taking almost ten pills a day. It later led on to cocaine and more stuff along the way. I would suggest taking it easy these next couple days, the withdrawls do not last long. Drink lots of water and take a multivitamin. Throw away the rest of your drugs. Get to a meeting when you are feeling better and do not think you are okay after getting through the withdrawal phase this is just the start. Sometimes our brains trick ourselves and say we are better when we really are not. Talk to someone in a meeting, grab a number if you can. You have nothing to be ashamed of millions of people have struggled with addiction. If you want to feel better and happy and leave that guilt and shame behind do what I said. That is what ultimately helped me. I mean if you can get to a detox that would be better but you need recovery support for a while to build a good mental stronghold again. Goodluck my friend. Thanks for reaching out. I have faith you will do the right thing.
 




 It will pass give it time and patience. Stay active in your recovery. Talk about how your feeling. 




 Great. Just finished a large meal now I am recovering.
