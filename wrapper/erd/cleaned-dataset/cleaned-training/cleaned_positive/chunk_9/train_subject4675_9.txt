 I stopped seeing a psychiatrist because of my mother not taking me. A talk would honestly be great... 




 May I just say, you *can not* hurt people the way you are. I don't condone it, and never will condone mistreatment of others. I think you need to get a hold on this problem of your's, which may be hard. Play violent video games, date someone who is a masochist, I don't know. Anything other than what you are doing. 




 Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed "I can't! No!" and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said "I just want to die" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying "What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried. A counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher (guy. funny. suffers from anxiety and depression) let me just vent, since he knows everything I have gone through with bestfriend/boyfriend person. I had to write an incident report because of what Madison did and shit. I got calmed down and when I finally started walking back to class, I saw M with bestfriend/boyfriend's beanie... I died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes, as always.
After that class ended, I went to bestfriend/boyfriend- let's start calling him J- and said "I don't think you mean to, but you're breaking my heart." and he just looked at me and said he was sorry, and explained him and M have nothing going on at all, and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down. I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote "I never meant to push anyone out, especially not you. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just..." I then said "Do we have a chance anymore, J?" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying "I don't know." and then he gave me a hug and I whispered "I'm sorry" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art  textiles...
I know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even really express it to him. Two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow, because they are both quite pissed about the way he's handling this, especially after today...
I miss what I had, and I don't know why I feel so broken. I really just want to die, to be honest. It would feel a lot better than this... I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds... I just... I've been suffering in silence for a month. Today, I broke that silence, but in the wrong way, and to the wrong person...
Sorry for that wall of text. 




 You might be a sadist by nature, which isn't necessarily "bad". However, if you are *really* hurting others, it's not good.

 My experience has been me just being overly sexual. Every little thing was sexual in my mind, and I could literally have sex with just about anybody as like as they were at least somewhat aesthetically pleasing. I only slept with 3 people though (a lot for a teenage girlI still have this problem but i have it under control at this point.
