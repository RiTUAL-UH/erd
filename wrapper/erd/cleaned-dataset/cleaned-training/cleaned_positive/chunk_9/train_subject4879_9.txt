 need a laptop for university, as well as some work related stuff. mostly going to be used for word processing, some video/picture editing, zero gaming. Ideally the laptop would have an ssd, or at least a hybrid. I am willing to pay extra for a great keyboard/trackpad and a great screen. I really want this laptop to last 4-5 years. willing to up my budget if need be. thank you 














 Between work and university I use my laptop a lot, and it can be quite bothersome to carry something heavy. I am looking for something lightweight, with around a 13 or 14 inch screen, solid battery life, and powerful enough components to run games. i dont game so much, but id like to be able to run skyrim, arkham games, ect, and have them looking fairly ok. thanks! 




 hi,

one of the classes I am currently enrolled on has alternate lecture that is at a more convenient time. this other section however, has a wait list. can I join the wait list for this other lecture, without losing my spot in my original one?

thanks
