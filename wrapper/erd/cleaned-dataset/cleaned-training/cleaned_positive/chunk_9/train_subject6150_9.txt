[Much Cube.](http://www.cubetutor.com/viewcube/12282)

This is a high-powered combo heavy cube. It's a work in progress. All suggestions for fixes/changes appreciated! 




 Thanks for the feedback! I have been considering adding more burn and brown ramp. I'll have to do that next time I am at my pc! I'm not sold on a perfectly color balanced cube. IMO, as long as it's pretty close all color combos are viable. Combos were something I was definitely trying to push. 




 I have been working on this for a while, its far from perfect but, I would love some input. Anything I am obviously missing? I'm hoping to print it off in the near future. Any feedback would be appreciated!
