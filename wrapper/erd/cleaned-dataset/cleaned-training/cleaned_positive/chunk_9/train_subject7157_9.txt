 Oh ._. sorry. 




 Thanks! Was curious about it. I have lots of time so I wanted to experiment with it... 




 I have looked into it - I wanted to hear from people who have used it on reddit. 




 Has anyone tried this?? What are your thoughts on Younique products? 




 Yeah... that's something that I don't want to do, lol. I'd like to find one foundation that I can stay with but if it means to combine two colors... then here goes nothing.  I haven't try that yet but I think I will.  Hmmm.
