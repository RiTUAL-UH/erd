 Thanks. You are right I should find out if I am actually helping him or not. If not I am just wasting his and my time. Yes I think his threats are real. Especially since they are not really threats, just him telling me how he feels and felt for years. I've tried to rationally asses if I am helping him by some harder endpoints in a [reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/2zzjkb/my_boyfriend_wants_to_kill_himself_xpost_from/cpo3bcm)...

I wonder if a therapist would be able to help me help him with only the information he'd get from me. I am scared that I am biased and not objective... But I guess it would be worth a try. If I can't get my boyfriend to get into therapy again, then I'll be the proxy...

I certainly don't think I am the best person to help him! Best would be two dozen of professionals plus a better girlfriend (someone with at least a sexual desire). And I try to find a way to find a girlfriend for him... since he gave up on that and does not seem to want someone else... I am just the best bad option available I guess...

 Are you maintaining the status quo for him, so you can avoid your own guilty feelings if he chooses to end his life? 

This is exactly what I am scared of. That helping him all these years was actually something selfish... How do I find out? 

I am sorry you went through something similar.. 

As for anatta.. I understood it the way that the "self" is constantly changing and dependent on so many influences, so that it does not make any sense wanting to describe it as something existing in itself. Like wanting to define a wave. Maybe I got that wrong.. as I said, I am not a experienced Buddhist and spent my day with physiology instead of sutras mostly... My sentence was some sort of misplaced humour I guess... Sorry!
