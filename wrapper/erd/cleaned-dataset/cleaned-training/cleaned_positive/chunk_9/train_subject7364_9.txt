 If you are in IT you'll eventually be able to telecommute ;)

Anyone who complains about traffic in Austin has obvously never been stuck on the beltway at Westheimer during a rush-hour traffic accident.

You think Austin is bad? If you hit that intersection in Houston like that you won't be home until 9:30 at night. 




 There will never be a shortage of engineering work here. Electrical, hydraulic, petroleum, all kinds of industrial work - especially on the coast in the refineries and in the oil fields.

Texas is also home to something like 20 nuclear power plants. 

If you want to make friends quickly, which you will anyway, bring a case or three of your best beer.

If you want to make money in Texas and always have a place to work no matter where you go then you'll want to look at mechanical engineering. There will always be machines to build here.

If you want to make a real impact, look at the renewable engery initiatives. There's some pretty big solar farms here, and thousands and thousands of wind turbines.

I personally have found IT to be a bit crowded. Lots of people apply for any open job, but the pay is outstanding and comparable to west coast rates, depending on how good you are. If you have an interest in computers, leverage it by minoring in computer science so you can major in your passion and use the computers as a tool to cultivate your happiness no matter what scientific field you wander into. 




 Houston has more IT jobs than Austin does just because it's so big, but Austin is arguably a better place to work.

 




 There's a lot of beautiful women in Texas.

Take the Gulf Coast for example. She's a shimmering example of easy going and fast paced all rolled up into one.

Then there's the border. She's got what you need whether it's food, booze, wild times, or all three.

Central Texas is a real beauty. She'll take you anywhere you want to be in Texas in a couple three hours.

The weather is the finicky one. If she wants me to tan up in January I'll be on the beach in Brownsville, but if she's feeling frigid I'll be throwing snowballs in the panhandle.

Plenty of good times to go around. Her bright nightlife is the place to take her when she's all dressed up with everywhere to go.

But my favorite is the way she lays down a stretch of I-10. One minute she'll be a fleeting smile on the highway and the next she's miles from nowhere.

What a gem. 




 I've seen telecommuting policies fail, and I understand why it happened. It's a new thing and the best practices are often not well understood, and moreover, implemented properly in accordance with business needs. You don't want your director of HR working from home, but letting a few high performers in the call center go home for three days a week, with a robust plan for monitoring performance, should be something tax breaks and other subsidies need to account for. When financial considerations are given to a business for allowing workers to telecommute, checks and balances need to be in place that guarantee some level of success for not just the business, but for the roads as well. Think: small business loan. You've got to prove you are going to make money to get that loan.

This is one aspect of our working lives that is going to grow from the ground up in this generation of professionals, and it's up to us to make sure they understand what it's going to take to realize the benefits.

When I say spread out, I didn't mean to imply any simplistic concept of sprawl. I'm very much in line with your idea of compact business districts with ideal access to residential areas and supporting services, I just don't like the idea of having 300 skyscrapers in five square miles that everyone is trying to get to all at once. Where are those flying cars we were promised? Ah, they are still stuck in those Sci-Fi movies, flying around in cities full of giant... buildings. It seems the buildings managed to materialize though the technology to support that population center model did not.

I think, in this light, that "spreading out" would be a good thing, but again we've never been able to, or even had to plan for a population like this before. It's all new ground and anything we can do towards the bigger picture of wasting less time and energy on unnecessary daily activities is going to help. Prolonging the inevitable by supplying people with the functional means to *barely* make it to work on time and back is counterproductive.

If the transportation system in Texas is not adequate, and we don't have the means to modify it to become far more efficient and effective, then the only obvious alternative is to look at the source of this dreaded freeway congestion, and that's the millions of hours Texan's spend commuting. Much like aspects of modern medicine, the symptom is treated in the name of profit for a few while the cause of the disease is ignored at the expense of many. That's the perception much of the public holds of our transportation system when we pay to drive through the middle of nowhere down the fastest, and arguably one of the least travled tollways in the country.

I'd like to see a more comprehensive plan with a little more innovation than just "its going to have the capacity to replace X lanes of traffic". Again, there has to be an incentive that makes sense in more way than one before people are going to get on board with it, so to speak. I'm not talking about giving away free toasters. I'm talking about needing corrective answer as to why businesses were not incensed to build along that toll road before it was routed through that veritable wilderness.

Give the employees an opportunity to ride that road for free if the business uses telecommuters. It can tie together in the end, it always does.

 




 I have taken the Red Line a couple of times and it was a real pain to get anywhere from where I got dropped off towards Leander. There isn't even public transportation down Parmer, even though there are dozens of apartment complexes past Mopac, and half a dozen more being built *right now*. NE Austin in particular has been widely ignored in this regard. It's oversight like that which defeats my vote. 

That is to say, your logic about only connecting two population centers is very well grounded in reality. One must not forget to service the intermediate area. I get it, believe me.

Please don't ever say "synergy". It's much worse of a buzzword than "telecommuting", and I'm wondering what serious initiatives, as serious as that Red Line debacle, have been put forth to spur the work-from-home impetus for employers? The only reason something like that fails is because the financial aspect of it doesn't make sense in the end.

This is the kicker: I have deliberately modified my career to be able to engineer VoIP and IP Networks *just so I can work from home*, or anywhere for that matter. I am lucky to have wound up in that area of work I guess. What I'm saying is that the befenits to businesses that can *rely* on telecommuting as a way of maintaining a workforce don't materialize on their bottom line, and as such the tax breaks, particularly for larger businesses, are not sufficient.

I'd be interested in seeing any study that showed what percentage of the people at one of the tall buildings downtown could do their work from home most days. Correlate that with how many hours they spend on the road and what that waste of energy does for drain on tax bucket.

I bet it's close enough for knobs to be turned. Obviously I am not some political major that understands every aspect of State Government or Civil Engineering, but I do feel the effects when there is a problem, and I did my part to solve it while pumping a little of my own money through this economy. I just wish others were as inclined to do the same and start asking their manager's if they can work from home.

If your manager says "yes", go home *and do a better job*. It's not as simple as just letting someone fly away and not be seen but only heard from via email. In order for telecommuting to work, there has to be *infrastructure* for it, and this is what I mean by serious initiative. You need comprehensive plans in video conferencing and bandwidth allocation to make that work. I had a camera pointed at me all day, and I could see and hear three coworkers too. It's great, like working on the Space Station or something. Where telecommuting fails is when you get a) lazy employees, and b) distant employees in terms of participation. One can be just as effective over a video conference as one can be in person unless you need to do something like... shake hands? It's a matter of perspective that makes it work, but unfortunatley, as you've pointed out, not many share this perspective.

I also get where building new roads is problematic. All I have to do is look at how they built that toll road that nobody uses way out in BFE to know that they had problems doing so.

People in Central Texas are simply going to have to face the fact that we need to spread out, or yes, this place is going to look like Los Angeles and *then* Detroit. I'll be one of the first to move even though I don't generally need to be on the road every day. Sitting in traffic for more than a few minutes a day just to go to a job in a cube where you don't talk to anyone face to face all day is so banal and demeaning.
 




 I always wondered how a school like UT would need to look anywhere else but on campus to find qualified IT personnel. They want someone with an education, right? Combo of experience *and* accredited education accepted?

How about 15 years of industry experience and having traveled the world? 




 I hadn't read the article. I just assumed it was another hare-brained scheme to make money and piss people off like every other aspect of public transportation. Turns out it has "been on the back burner" forever, like it's not important or something.

It's called being disenfranchised. It's a natural reaction to all the bullshit I've seen come out of Austin in the name of mass transit for the last two decades or longer.

I really don't see these passenger cars taking a significant load off of I-35 that will put a dent in the traffic problem over a long term. We have this commuter rail thing and look at Mopac and 35, not just at rush hour, but any time. Has that helped? Probably a little but it's not nearly enough to ease the congestion.

What's needed is NEW ROADS and TELECOMMUTING TAX WRITEOFFS. They can build all the rails they want next to the roads, and save a metric shit ton of energy by letting people, ahem, ME, work from home. And I still think they should fine people for driving through Austin down 35 instead of taking the toll way. 




 Everyone and their mother who makes money off of delivering content to your home besides your ISP is going to be against this. 

One can only hope. I am the only person I know who is all about liberty or death when it comes to this; I'll cut the cord before Google charges me to look at ads and Comcast charges me to download them. I am a network engineer. I know how the fucking Internet works and what costs money and what doesn't. What Comcast is doing, and the general direction the Internet is going, is absolute bullshit.

This is what I miss about the old Internet. Textfiles.org used to have a giant zipfile of some of the most god-awful and some of the best DIY stuff ever written, but it was something tangible. Once you downloaded that thing, and better yet, managed to find a way to print it up before a nuclear apocalypse wiped out electricity for good, you were set to survive it.

Time to set up that FreeBSD repository and the Wikipedia mirror I've always wanted to run before it's too late.

 Yeah, all my money goes to Reddit, and then the links start disappearing because I can't donate to 70,000,000 websites. 




 Having additional charges on top of the manslaughter because a police cruiser was used has the same net effect. There should be more of a penalty for this situation. 




 Awesome. A four hour train ride to go 60 miles, with the bonus of being probed and harassed by the TSA all the time.

They should just start fining people who drive all the way through Austin without stopping on 35 instead of taking the toll road. 




 A basic tenet of equality is that things are unfair when the playing field is leveled. It's the reason you don't see the Miami Midgets playing for the NFL - they would get beating pretty badly, wouldn't they?

So give the rest of the populace a police cruiser, a badge, and a gun, and only then can this be about equality. Cops should absolutely be judged with a discriminating eye. For one, they are rarely convicted, and two, there are hardly any cases where additional charges have been brought about.

It's either that or riots. Take your pick.


 




 Bullshit. If you are put into a position of public trust to protect human life, and you abuse that trust by taking it for personal gain (ie, "kicks" in this fucker's case), then you should be punished in that context, not the context of someone not sworn to uphold the law. 




 It's ok. The Mexican Military will have this under control. I'm sure they won't have a problem killing unarmed civilians in the name of national security. They've already been doing it in the name of profit for a long time. 




 Most people aren't given a gun and badge in the process.

There should be additional charges thrown at this man because he is in a position of public trust.

Something like a tribunal would be a good start. 




 The man should not be allowed near a gun, nor a set of car keys ever again. It is a gross abuse of authority and taxpayer funds that only causes civil unrest, the worst abuse of power law enforcement can produce.

It is here to stay and we all know it. Our society as a whole is built upon a way of life where killing was the only way to survive. In order to overcome our primitive upbringing as a species we must first take an honest look at where we came from. Once a sobering effect is felt we can dismamtle and rebuild those aspects of our need for law and order from what was once barbarism and moral terpitude into something more congruent with the fact that we are a race of beings designed for killing yet have the potential to travel the universe. 




 This causes riots, which causes more police, which causes more hiring mistakes, which causes more asshole cop, which causes more riots...

I say hangem high. 




 I think assholes live in every country. 




 Good thing I am averse to semen. Better let our wives know this is a thing though...

Update: asked my wife not to touch semen from India. She said "ok". 




 I have not read an article with that much slant in a long time.

Anyway, fuck those cops. If you have no clue how to handle people with mental problems then you have mental problems and shouldn't be allowed to wield authority, let alone a gun. 




 Good Lord don't scare them off. You seem like your head works much like mine does.

That shit is TERRIFYING and causes PTSD.
 




 Lucid dreaming, or the onset of awareness, often involes a trigger of some sort to clue in the dreamer that what they are experiencing is actually in their head. The rest is pretty natural, and it seems humans are pretty good at controlling their environment when given all the means necessary - such as those found inside one's own mind during a dream.

I've always wanted to fly and can remember having those dreams since I was very young. At some point in a dream I would find myself running, and gravity itself seemed... different. At least for me. Seconds later I am off and running, taking longer and longer strides until I sail into the air at breakneck speeds.

I've flown across the Universe in my dreams since. Today I no longer need a trigger per se. I have had enough practice to pick up on far less obvious aspects of my surroundings or sense of self to know when I am dreaming. That is, when to take advantage of the fact that I am dreaming.

Just last night I was floating around town. It was great, but some of the more powerful lucid dreams I have had involve creating entire worlds, ecosystems, cities... very much a reason for me to go to bed early and wake up late.

Remember the triggers. Remember to perform reality checks on yourself from time to time as it may develop into a habit which activates itself even while dreaming.

Good luck. Maybe I'll see you up there ;) 




 I am told that early this AM, as I lay in my bed about to sleep off a considerable amount of alcohol, that I complained about, among other things, the distance between my side of the bed and the nearest toilet. I then, allegedly, promptly unzipped my pants, rolled onto my side, and urinated directly onto the shag carpet for approximately 4 minutes straight. In the ensuing conversation I was somehow able to justify this terrible behaviour, assuring my SO, in spite of her protests, that it was very normal and acceptable for me and by me to be doing this, ie "no, it really is ok". I was also allegedly very nice about the whole ordeal, which makes this a little more believable if you know me.

I do not recall this event, but there is, however, ample "evidence" that said event did occur on or near my side of the bed at a mean distance of approximately two feet from where my penis would have been.

There is also a foul smelling cell phone, to which my SO is referring as "Exhibit A", which can be proven to have experienced water damage, but whether or not the damage is actually from my urine, human urine, or even urine at all is not provable with any technology at my immediate disposal.

Disclaimer: This is not an admission of guilt.

 Damn. It's never Colorado. 




 Is it in Colorado? 




 Possiblity 1)

Sparky get's mugged leaving LAX and winds up homeless and dies.

Possibility 2)

Sparky makes it to Las Vegas in a rented convertible with a suitcase full of drugs and winds up winning $850,000 on the roulette wheel. Develops cocaine habit. Dies.

Possibility 3)

Sparky uses his money wisely and invests in an education in a city with relatively low living costs and higher demand for whatever burger flipping skills Sparky developed in SE Asia. Sparky graduates, gets a job, a wife, a family, cancer, then dies.

 Don't these assholes realize that these kids have parents who might lose it and shoot them in the face for doing things like this to their children? 




 My father lived inside a telephone, and so does my son. As I needed a father, I am denied fatherhood. 

Now see the black feathers of ash from my broken dreams escape my desperate grasps, floating to the floor through ghostly, powerless, nonexistent hands. 

Loss is my fatherless childhood becoming my son's as I falter into these puddles tragic and tumultuous, witnessing the world through my father's tired eyes.

 Petoskey Stone
http://www.michiganscience.org/15583


FTA

**The Petoskey stone was made the state stone of Michigan by** legislative action. House Bill 2297 was signed by then-Gov. **George Romney** in 1965, thus elevating this fossil to the prestigious position it now holds around the world as something one must seek, find or purchase when visiting Michigan. 




 Ok.. I got this.

Michigan's state fossil is the mastadon.

The guy in the picture is a businessman/politician. Likely a republican.

A pachyderm.

Pachyderms taste good on pizza.

 I will ask r/anthropology if they can reconstruct what he may have looked like when he was alive. 




 Well, eggs don't sound very yummy an hour after that omelette, but I'll humor you and google for something besides food. 




 OH THE GUY IS THE FOSSIL!

edit: can't be. has nothing to do with food. 




 Ok so far this thread has devolved into a discussion about food.

But there is a connection.

OP's hints:

It has to do with Michigan (an oven mitt)

The singers are The Supremes (great pizza)

I will update this thread when someone figures out how to contrive the "fossil" into this cheesy madness. 




 [Ah, the supremes](https://www.google.com/search?q=supreme+pizzassource=lnmstbm=ischsa=X).

Can totally get the connection here. 




 Nono.. you are just imagining things because you are hungry.

Michigan is the oven mitt. Be careful not to bite yourself tonight while cooking your pizza. 




 Can we have a hint? Like what food these people are really eating that's obviously just out of frame. 




 I had eggs earlier. This sub is turning out to be OK in my book.

I made an omelette with leftover pizza toppings. The pizza was kinda gross but the toppings whipped right up into an awesome omelette. 




 Bacon... nation! 




 Pizza is my guess.
