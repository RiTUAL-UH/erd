 Thank you, a lot that you said (minus the quote) are things I've heard from my therapist and psych but hearing (reading?) it from someone here somehow feels more personal and inspiring. All I can really say to everyone is thank you, I'm very grateful for the support. 
And yes, my mom has difficulty with depression. She treats it + me with it + the meds, hell, all of it, like something so dirty and shameful. :/ 




 That makes perfect sense, and I hope it turns out that way. The thing is, I told my psych that I've been depressed multiple times in my life and he drew the conclusion that it was likely hereditary and therefore an issue I was always going to have. (chemical and not environmental) So if I weened off, chances are I'd have to get back on at some point. So, I suppose this is something I need to come to better terms with. Again, I'm not ashamed, just afraid of dependency.
