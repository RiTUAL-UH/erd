 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 15. After about a year and a half of trying a dozen or so different medications, I was FINALLY prescribed something that seemed to help. I was feeling much better, my self harm stopped/suicidal thoughts stopped, I became more social, I could focus on school/get things done. Then my mom noticed that I wasn't eating as much as I used to, and decided to do some research about the medication I was on.  She made me stop taking it immediately afterwards. She said that there was something called 'amphetamines' in it, and that it was bad (I know what it means now, lol). 

A couple months later I attempted suicide, and was put on a few more anti-depressants that did nothing for me until I moved away for college, and haven't been on anything since. I'm at a point right now where my boyfriend is literally begging me to get help, because of my current mental state. I've scheduled an appointment with a counselor, and I will be seeing a psychiatrist soon after. I really do not want to go through countless meds that I know will do nothing for me, but I don't want to seem like a drug seeker. I know I exhibit symptoms of ADD but they didn't come to surface until I was in middle school... so I highly doubt I will ever be diagnosed with it. I need help with how I would approach this subject with a psychiatrist.
