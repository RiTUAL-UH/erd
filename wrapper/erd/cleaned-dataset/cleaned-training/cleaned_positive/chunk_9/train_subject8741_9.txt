 I used to have a friend like that. She was the best but, I moved away and moved back after a few years and didn't contact her......I just feel super nervous about making contact again. And worry that they're about it or something. I understand the part about not being able to fully express yourself at work. It's almost painful not to be able to personal appearance wise and when communication. Plus, working in healthcare you really can't let it show. I'm not too close with family either, there is a lot of negativity and shit talking and I'm not about that..Well maybe once in a while I'll get super pissed but it's usually a delusion. I am usually my own worst enemy when it comes down to it. I don't know where this fucking voice came from to tell you the truth. I'll get these weird sounds and scenarios that play in my head over and over and they just reduce me to nothing. I used to be nice to everyone too, that shit didn't work out to well did it? Is your family super judgemental?
