 Anyone remember him from 7th Heaven? 




 Coldstone is the fucking bomb! 




 If I were Merlin, I'd be mad disappointed if my permanent form was an old man.  




 I'm a sophomore there :) 




 You go to Dickinson? 




 I sat next to him at a magic show once! I could barely contain myself... 




 "It's Perrrryyy! Perry the Platypus!" 




 i wish my cat would hug me... 




 I used to go to Kiawah, which is the island next to John's. I saw Angel Oak once. So amazing.  




 Mmmm. Damn.  




 I really wish there would be a big display of Merlin's power. Over and over we hear that he's this all powerful warlock, but he hasn't shown anything that much more powerful than other characters with magic.  




 This is why I need to swim again. 




 Saw that same display a couple months ago. Beautiful. 




 NSFL 




 indeed. 




 haha thanks. luckily I'm not over 40, so hopefully recovery will go smoothly. Was it weird to swim after such a long time? 




 My mom and I got in a big fight when I was 14. She accused me of not loving her...and I didn't refute the statement. I broke her heart that night and the next morning she was dead of a drug overdose.  




 Alright. 6 weeks. I'm gonna have to be patient then. lol 




 Thanks. I'll keep that in mind. Attitude is important. :) 









 hot.
