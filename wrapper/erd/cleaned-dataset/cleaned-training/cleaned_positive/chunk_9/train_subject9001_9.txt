 Thanks for being appropriate, HumanMilkshake. 




 Hah, maybe in a few years I'll check that out.  




 Nude surfing in front of slipknot would've been a much nicer way to go about it, haha.  




 I mean I've had much more fucked things happen to me, this was pretty tame. I think I have a very botched perspective on my sexuality/boundaries because of my past experiences.  




 I'd have to wait a few years, haha. Thank you for the advice though.  




 I've thought about it for a while, I was genuinely just curious. I wouldn't even be able to do it until I'm of age as well.  




 Oh yeah. It's totally inappropriate and wrong to expose a person against their will. I'm lucky that I happen to have the interests I do have or that would've probably ruined my night and been horrifying.  




 Oh yeah, I don't know how to describe the feeling exactly but I just feel more like myself, if that makes sense.
