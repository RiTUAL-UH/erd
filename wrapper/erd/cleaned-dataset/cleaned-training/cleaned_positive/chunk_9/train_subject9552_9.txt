 It seems like Catcher in the Rye is a book that people either love or hate. Some people feel like its devoid of meaning, but some people resonate with the character's feelings. It's really interesting how literature does that. 




 I share your frustration! But I keep coming back to it because I love how Fitzgerald describes things, such as, “For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened - then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.” And he writes things like “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.” and “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone's away. There's something very sensuous about it - overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”
