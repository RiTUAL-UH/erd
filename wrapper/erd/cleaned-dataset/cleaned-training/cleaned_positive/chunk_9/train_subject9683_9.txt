Both heroes are told not to use their powers, and to let the inevitable happen. 




 As if there's nothing interesting in store for them in seasons to come. 




 Oh really? Please enlighten us on all the "many mistakes". 




 tl;dr

But there is Star City. Which they hinted at when Ray Palmer made his pitch or whatever for Queen Inc./Palmer Tech. 




 Me too, I love the show. I think Season 4 will give us the lighter-hearted Oliver Queen. 




 Probably not, but there will be hundreds of videos of the important stuff, then in a few weeks or months, you'll get the full panels so you can hear Stephen Amell profess his bromance with Diggle for the hundredth time xP 




 Roger that. 




 It's a shame they wasted huge villains like Komodo and Count Vertigo in a matter of one episode.

EDIT: and Brick. 




 No, they wanted to do Onomatopoeia but they did Mr.Blank instead when Kevin Gates (creator of Onomatopoeia) said there was no way to bring that character to television or film. 




 Talia Al Ghul will just feed the critics that want to say this is a Batman-ripoff, even though the only true exclusive Batman villains on the show were: Firefly, Deadshot and the Dollmaker.  




 Well she did train with a pro boxer and Nyssa. 




 ah okay, yea I see it now, rewatching it. The red eyes. :D 




 I like the Felicity/Oliver relationship, I just wish they would've handled it better. Like Diggle and Lyla's relationship. 




 Clearly it's the dude says these beautiful quotes (DIGGLE!!!!): 

* "Damnit Oliver, you would've been dead ten times over if it wasn't for me"
* "I guess from now on, I'll be watching you pee"
* "My secret identity is his black driver"
* "You know, Oliver, somebody once told me that secrets have weight. The more you keep, the harder it is to keep moving."
* "Felicity, I don't think there's a force on earth that can make you a bad person."
* "Things are as good now as ever will be Oliver. And you love her. You even told her so." ... (Oliver: "I was trying to fool Slade.") ... "Yes, except now the only person you're fooling is yourself."

**Currently my favourite Diggle Quote**:

* " I don't know. For the first time since I met Oliver Queen I don't know what happens next. I know it's silly, but I still like to think of myself as Oliver's bodyguard. I just couldn't protect him. It's funny. He was worried something would happen to me."

There are many more, but I'll leave it at that. 




 I'm pretty sure Cisco made it. He reconstructed the particle accelerator to hold meta-humans. 




 Why couldn't Oliver survive on his own when he got to Lian Yu?


Same answer. 




 Merlyn is affiliated with the LoA in the comics, and the only reason the League was even a huge plot was because of Merlyn. Other than that, it was just some assassin group that Sara joined. Also, Black Canary has ties to the LoA as well. So the Sara/Nyssa and Laurel/Nyssa scenes were a nod to that. 




 wtf? 




 How? would he cum at super speed? 




 Well that's a shitty parent if I've ever seen one. 




 LOL

"Thea Queen! Where is Malcolm Merlyn"

"I-I don't know... please don't hurt me"

*throws broken glass* *fights for like 3 seconds*

"Stay away from me and my father"

*runs and jumps off a balcony.... and survives with no grappling hook or anything* 




 in real life he does, right now. 




 yea, apparently he made those android like the members of the Justice League... I assume it's something similar to Sentinels in X-Men. 




 Yea, he was a doctor searching for a cure for his wife's mental illness. 




 Thankfully I only decided to go back to AO3 today, I have the most updated version of my story on Wattpad. 




 Nevermind.

**Please note:** Unposted drafts are only saved for a month from the day they are first created, and then deleted from the Archive. 




 So I had started an Arrow/The Flash fanfiction on AO3, and decided to use Wattpad instead because I like it's layout, but today I decided to return to AO3.. and my story is gone, I hadn't posted it yet, I was in the middle of writing chapter 1. Does AO3 delete inactive stories in progress? Also when I went to "edit works" I saw 2 project(I guess you could call them) that were blank. 




 I don't think they're dating. 




 NOOOO GRODD! NO GRODD PLEASE NO! NO! NO! NOOOO!!!!! 




 Ah alright, sorry if I came off as angry or anything, I thought you were being mean and tried to prove you wrong.  




 comparing Smallville Green Arrow to 2015 CW's Arrow.

I think they can work something out, after all, he was sleeveless on the island, where he faced some pretty crazy shit. 




 Highly doubtful, with his child's age (if that is Connor Hawke), and if it's not gonna be Connor Hawke, I doubt we'd see a season with someone other than Connor or Oliver as the Green Arrow. 




 well groddamn.... I don't... but I do hope for a Season 1/Season 2 Felicity. I want the quirky computer genius not the "Season 2 Laurel" wannabe with no reason to be that emotional.
