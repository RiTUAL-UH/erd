 Sandra?  




 If I lost a camera with all my personal pictures on it, I would love for someone to try and return it. I guess you think the OP should just wipe it and keep it? 




 I don't know...the extra 30 bucks a month I make from it sure comes in handy...;-)  




 Poor grammar.

Darn skools n-e-ways.  




 As much as you can under your circumstances. Even a short paragraph is a good start if it's all you have time for. More time? Keep going until you can't.

One of the biggest hurdles in writing is finding the time. (at least for me) 




 Want to crack a safe? Done

Life of crime? Easy

Save lives? Perfect! Can deflect bullets...more anything. All by thinking.

Choices would be unlimited.  




 Unlimited telekinesis. Really, not much else after that. 

Flying - Make yourself fly.

Need anything, poof you have it.  




 Google...Pokemon Online Multiplayer. 

Receive answer. 

Tada!  




 You...do not have a pre-teen daughter. 




 I would like this as well. I have a bunch just sitting around... 




 I would be a person that makes torpedoes out of scorpedoes, and that would be awesome! 




 Blood...She wanted more. 




 I can only speak for myself, but I try to keep my descriptions limited. When I read others books and they start to get all flowery with their writing I tend to just skip ahead. I like to form the scene in my own head and I trust my readers to be able to do the same.

Now, that being said, it is ultimately up to you how much description you add. Just be sure to get some good beta readers, and trust them if they say you don't need those four pages describing a chair. 




 It seems Amazon has finally realized that my collection of short stories have been free everywhere else but on their site, grab it now before they mess up and put it up again for $100 or something crazy like that.

 Yet... 




 Poverty? What's that? (Stuffs his -will write for food- sign behind his back) 




 I am happy to say, this is completely raw, all writing, no editing. But it was my first sentence, and is subject to change. 

Thanks :-)  




 Okay, first 3 lines...but...

The mirror lay in broken shards randomly strewn across the polished stone floor. This was the end. I had no escape left to me.


It's my current, almost finished, WIP. 




 It was public, and yep, massively downvoted.  




 Go ahead, or "go ahead and" 
i = I 
Doesn't = Don't
(This is the correct way to get down votes!)
 




 Ever do any beta reading? Or would you be interested in works in advance of publication for the purpose of honest feedback? I am in need of random strangers that would have no reason to -spare my feelings-.  




 I was considering opening my laptop and start writing some more, but I only had 45 mins...what do you read (listen to)? 




 Kids always wake up way before me...no morning time here. 




 I tell my wife to slow down on the cleaning and enjoy life more...she doesn't listen either. 




 I personally am enjoying the silence right now...not a single noise I am not making...so nice. 









 Latest one I am working on is entitled Mirror Thief. The main character can enter and exit the world in side a mirror. 




 A book cover for one of my works!  




 One does not simply -drive- into Mordor.  




 Just came to post the same thing, it's old news, still glad it happened to him, but old news the same. 




 I don't get a ton of random stranger complements, my wife says women flirt with me often, but I guess I don't see it. However, the few times I can recall a woman telling me they thought I was (something) I can say I was flattered, and I didn't think any more of it. But it doesn't happen often enough to remember more details. 

Not to mention a male perspective is too often skewed by inconsistencies.  




 Perhaps not so much a hit and run as a...shared moment in time.  




 I can see that, but would you take offense if no-one said anything, ever?
I haven't even owned a trench coat in years!

In all fairness, as another commenter said, this works just as well as a woman speaking to a man...Of course, most men would take it completely the wrong way and think a woman is reading to go all the way or something... 




 Ahhh! But a persons perspective changes everything. I honestly think most models are only mildly attractive if at all, I can see a mother smiling at a child, her hair a mess her clothing tossed and no makeup, yet think she is stunning. Does this make sense? 




 Yes...the internet can be a terrible medium for an open discussion sometimes. This was just a question I had rolling around in my head today when I saw a beautiful woman, natural beauty, not the purely painted kind. She was married as well, as I had helped her husband earlier...just a thought, no intent.

I also thought that, when did it become wrong to do something like this...were we always so afraid?

Sometimes I think too much.  




 Whew, but I still don't think I will randomly say it, cept to my wife. 




 I hope so, but I don't know for sure...didn't add the sarcasm smiley. :-)  




 How can this give offense? Do you wear makeup? Do you hair? Is it only for yourself...? Serious questions, I am honestly not trying to offend. 




 So if the person wondered away never to be seen again, this would be even more frightening to you? Or...? 




 I can understand that completely, that's why I am stressing the random/stranger/one moment aspect of it all. 




 I can't say I know that glint, but as a man myself it may be hard for me to know if I have it or not...I will ask my wife, she will know :-)  




 Thank you, I live in a smaller town, if I don't know the person, I probably know someone who does. But the thought has remained, why should it be wrong if it's completely innocent. 




 Any situation can be turned creepy by the wrong person, it's more the entire random, genuine moment, and finished... 




 Yes, I could understand the difference, I mean in a complete, random stranger, brush encounter, never to be seen again... 




 If you don't mind answering? Why? I often see women I think are completely stunning, I have no interest in them in other ways, so I keep my thoughts to myself. But why would it offending, I am generally interested. Also, as a side note, I have a scene like this in one of my writings and wondered at the realism of it, since I don't see people doing it. 









 You do have to be in the USA though... :-( 




 Thank you. It's a tough racket to get into. 




 When the car is not running, I assume you read her other comments, the battery is not being charged. She also stated this wasn't the first time, and she knew it should have been replaced long ago. 

If the car had died, while running, than yes...replace the alternator. 

Do some reading before you randomly comment like this, it only makes you look like...well, you said it best.  




 It's *Band* and no...I don't mind them being hidden at all.  




 I would settle for more book sales, but I will take the cookie for now. ;) Thank you.
 




 Yes, I really do. Getting the wife to help can be problematic though, and I need to keep them away from windows (and the kids). But it does help with a level of realism in sword fighting scenes.  




 I have a couple of swords in my collections just for this exact purpose. 




 *This. 




 For my action scenes it does help to think it through and sometimes get up to mimic the motions. Anything to bring the realism to my readers.  




 Here is an article to help you understand. 

http://m.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/first-google-glass-users-cant-sell-or-even-loan-their-1C9506946

There is still a lot that's hush hush with them. 




 Google glasses can not be traded or resold. If you do, they can remotely disable them. In theory, this pair can no longer be disabled. 




 I too have been trapped by the wonderings of....squirrel! 




 I make sure that if I am in a reading stint I keep my writing to a minimum, and visa versa. I guess you could say, I too, am influenced by what I am reading at the moment. 









 Now that I can see as a better reason to write here.

 If 1.50 won't even buy a coffee to fuel the writing = no point. 

But, 1.50 will now feed you for a week... 




 I think in this instance the old adage -you get what you pay for- does truly apply here. For the most part the people hiring here seem to want things fast and dirty.

Mostly dirty. 




 I can't stop reading them! It's like watching a train wreck. Paying 1.50 per hour for you to write erotica...must write at least 2 stories a day...I can make more than that just writing my own stories.  




 TIL: People expect writers to work for nothing. 

5000 words a day min for 15 dollars? 25 dollars for a 60k book edit? 

Ouch.  




 He would have gotten away if he just pulled up his pants... 




 Damn my memory!!! 




 Damn my memory! Demon's souls! My bad... 




 Yeah, not the last boss. Not even close. 




 Please hold for a very important message. 




 Hit me with a PM and I will email you a PDF tomorrow night. :-)  




 It actually snows very little up there, mostly just wind blowing it around. 




 I say... Dead. 









 Read the comments. There were none made before today. People make pages all the time, I even have a few. It's very simple to change the name. 




 Obviously. And this post has been made by many others, they have been shown the same thing. 




 Yes, the page was, it was renamed today. Anyone can do this. 




 Really? Right off the front page?  




 Welcome, please feel free to tell your friends as well. More the merrier! 




 If your check engine light comes on, you should take it to a mechanic. I would leave the pets behind when you do... 




 They are now free! Feel free to grab them, and let your friends know as well. Thank you.  




 Once you DL them, they are yours to read. If you should erase them at a later date, you can re-dl them at no charge. Enjoy! 









 Thank you! I will post it up there instead. I searched for the right place to put this. Guess I didn't search far enough. 




 Everyone has a gift and it would be a true waste if you were to erase yours. I am happy to have been able to share in the experience of your gift. Keep it up. 




 I wouldn't mind seeing something like this. I try to add what I can when people ask, but I have to agree that some of the requests are a touch daunting for the time I have available. 




 This is pretty clinical. You need to drop some details and add some spice. You have to give me (your readers) something to say, hey, I have to grab this story! 
 




 You find any, let me know. I make less than you do and my wife and I are sitting here right now trying to find ways to come up with more money.
I write books on the side and try to sell them, but I don't even have enough time to push them properly.

It's a no win situation and I wish you the best. 




 I just went through rotator cuff surgery. Torn tendon.

Doesn't sound as bad as yours does. I was told 6 weeks in a sling, I was out in 4. I was told 6 months before lifting anything, it's been 10 weeks and I am at about %80 strength. Gaining mobility and strength every week. Slow and steady here.

Did it hurt? 

Hell yah.

It's better now though...and I don't have any of the pain that I had before. I wouldn't worry about it. If it hurts now, you will deal with it later. The end result is worth it. 




 I am not a DR, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night, how about you go see a real doctor instead of asking for help online? 

You know, like real medical advice? 




 Time itself. 




 But they are always making more lego, so...63...64...65... 




 350 words and 19 of them are wheel or wheelbarrow...I almost thought I knew what you were trying to say here, but then I lost it. 

I'm sorry.

If his was meant to be abstract writing, I believe you went a little too far from the edge, and fell off.  




 First thing I think I can help you with is...

With reddit it, it erases your formatting. The best way to get it back is to do a double carriage return. That will help make this patch more readable. I had the same problema couple days ago.

Second thing of note, the boy was supposed to be scared, but he sure was talkative. As a personality trait, most people when afraid clam up. A better way to make this come alive is to keep your sentences shorter, and more choppy, when he is speaking.

Other than those little things, I like what I see. You do create a not traditional mermaidimage, but it works. 




 I am a big fan of the -show don't tell- writing style, and your first line starts me on an edge. I can understand the need to tell if you are trying to keep a story as short as possible, but perhaps some more description would spice up the writing.

"The trees surrounded me. Their canopy so thick it was impossible to tell if it was night or day."

Now, that's a simplistic take on what I see, I could be completely wrong if your intent was the opposite.

Just my two bits. 




 I can try to dredge up some sites. If you do a search on reddit I am fairly confident you will find multiple posts on the subject.

The biggest downside is the time investment, review sights can take months (or longer) to get to your work. Coordinating it all to come together for a big send off is a big commitment.

In case you are wondering, I learned most of this because I made the same mistake on my first releases. Live and learn though. 




 Reviews can make or break your work. It's best to give out free copies to reviewers and cross your fingers they like it. It's a very hard thing to do, but honest reviews with ups and downs are worth more than gold. 

People don't like taking a chance, even at free.

My best month I had almost 5k free downloads on my works, it resulted in 3 reviews, and one of those was 1 star because he didn't get around to reading it.

#bangsheadonwall
 




 I wish you the best, but for the best exposure, you really need to start the promo at least one month in advance. The more time you have to get ready, the better.

You need to have reviews up and ready.

It's best to have as many blogs as possible showing his work and having interviews or at least something up.

On twitter, you should be doing a contest, a giveaway, something to pull in more readers.

On facebook , goodreads, LinkedIn, and as many other sites as you can get, you need to do pre-posts weeks in advance. Try to drag in as much anticipation as you can.

Local book stores, some hate indie's others are quite open to all others, run a giveaway if you can, and if they let you, try to have some posters up to promote your release day.

Sorry, this is off the top of my head, and typed on my tablet, I am sure I missed a thing or two, but good luck regardless! 




 This is incredible, tell your Grandpa that I applaud him. If he does decide to publish it, make sure he does his research if he chooses indie publishing.  




 It was my intent to have an overtone of a slowly fading beat, the heart. Perhaps I went a little to strong with it. Thank you. 




 If you lose your internet, you can't play the game. Even if it is a solo game. Like Sim City was/is. 




 The ring of the phone faded into the back of Tara's mind. It was an older phone, heavy, with a rotary dial, and in a shade of light green that was once popular. The color had always reminded her of pea soup, the kind her long past grandmother used to make. The ringing would stop if she left it long enough. It always stopped, and she always ignored it.

Sitting in an old chair, its cover ripped and stained, her arms stretched out, she felt the coarse material under her. Her skin was only a shadow barely seen. A window showed the only light in the room, the faint glow coming through it. She pulled the darkness in close around her, a comfortable friend.

The weatherman had been right about the rain, for once. The steady dripping against her windowsill comforted her in a way she couldn't explain. It tapped out a rhythm matching the heart beating inside her chest. The two intertwined, leaving Tara unsure where one started, and the other ended. The weak light from outside showed the tiny rivers of water cascading down along the glass, hoping to join their brothers and sisters again in a sea of lost friends. The tears they made in their brief visit to her world reminded her of those that fell down her own face. Untouched by humanity, they left only faint traces, as they too escaped to join new friends of a different color, pooling on the floor.

The cold Tara felt was not from the window, or from her dark room. It was a chill from the inside. Others had told their last story and she had drunk the words. Always thirsty for the knowledge they released before the end. She knew this feeling would come, a familiar friend and a welcome one.

Eyelids became heavy for a moment, blurring the window before her, its surface still heavy with rain. She longed to see the heavens one last time, but the streetlight outside stole the night sky from her, the dark clouds blanketing the sky. The faint glow from the street lamp pierced the rain on the glass, creating a million stars shining in front of her eyes, before her slow, tired blink wiped them clear. A smile broke on her lips touched with a blue from her spreading inner cold.

Fingertips painted a slow river of glistening red. They dripped down in a rhythm unlike the rain, painting a poor canvas stretched across the floor. She thought the drops were falling slower than they should. They landed at random, uncaring whether they matched the patterns created around them. A drummer, who played his own beat while the rest of the band played on.

She took a deep breath, and felt sudden warmth. Tara had done all the research, and they hadn't gotten this right. Her fading mind enjoyed the sensation. It spread from inside, like that first sip of a hard drink, a falsehood that promised comfort, but never delivered.

Her eyes were heavy again, and her vision sprinkled with hints of diamonds, the window a blur. The phone rang again, a distant sound, farther than the blood, farther than the rain. They faded as the darkness took over.

The rain stopped.
 









 Thank you all for the input.
My wife interupted me tonight, but I managed to get a minor 500 words down. It's better than nothing, and a start in what I believe is the right direction.  



























































 Someone threatening my family. 




 Unless you are able to make up new words, you will be using words others have used regardless. It's normal, keep writing.

For the record, I made up the word 'bapple' you can't use that one. 




 I am a 6f tall, shaved head, goatee'd face, tattoo'd 220lb white male...you want to talk about profiling? I can't even cross a border with my kids in the back seat, they will search the car and ask my kids if I am their area dad.

Profiling works both ways here. 




 I finally had Amazon price match one of my works to free...and that single book is averaging around 250 'sales' a month.

My other works sell comparitavely slow, anywhere from zero - the low teens per month.

Of course, my promo time has been drastically reduced as of late and that is effecting my sales. As well as the fact I am working on my next release.

As far as patterns go? Yeah, if I self promo a ton, I sell more works, if I am silent, so are my sales.

 Actually, we trained for everything.

I trained my students for handling a drive by shooting.

When they got to the basic exam, it was a breeze because the basic scenerios were so easy com paired to what we practiced.

And yes, we used a weight, now remember that 50lbs on dry land is not 50lbs underwater.

We also taught students self defense in water, how to disable a panicked victim as well as how to get out of the grasp of someone who is trying to drown you.

I may add, I am a Canadian, our training has always been harder, my classes were harder than that.

One of my students has even gone on to be an Emerg DR in our local hospital. We still stay in contact. 




 I trained lifeguards for about 9 years of my life, you could have saved him with the right training.

But you don't have it.

You did your best, and are alive today because of that failure. I would say keep trying to find the woman, even if it is to only exchange a note, or a picture. It can greatly help with the closure you need.

You did the right thing.  




 I already did that one...sorta...I used solar radiation instead. :-)  




 Ferris Beulers day off...always a good watch. 




 Until we found out they used real animals and killed a couple dozen while filming, this was one my kids loved to watch. Not any more. 




 Found it! They messed the math it seems, best not make the same mistake.

 It's a drain. I don't drink from a drain pipe either. 




 Married my wife 7 years ago, but this year hasn't been lucky in the least. 




 My wife and I have been together for 9 years. This is our seventh anniversary and it was supposed to be a special one. 7 month 7 years on the 7th.

We had planned everything out, but about two days before we left, the whole family got sick. And I mean, SICK. Chronic fevers, persistent nagging dry cough, sore throats, ear infections. Plumbing went south, the whole works. So we are sitting with the kids and contemplating just packing it in 3 days early, and driving the 9 hours back home to just suffer there.

We forced ourselves to do a hike yesterday. And paid for it at night. It was one thing off a list of about 6 things we wanted to do.

It took us almost a whole year to save for this trip, we get one a year at best. And now it's a wipe.

This sucks on so many levels. 




 Samples?

Hit us with the first frame when you get it, would love to see it. 




 While I can't answer all your questions, I can tell something like this was done on star trek TNG. Perhaps some research into the science of what they did might help you. 




 My wife, my kids, my family. 




 The sun came up this morning,
It will again tomorrow,
These times an be tough, but you will pull through.
 




 Ahhhh! ooohhhh.... hmn. 




 My wife was 20 when we met, I was 31. What you are doing is perfectly normal, and a smart decision.

Your father...is your father. You will always be his little girl. I say this while looking at my 7yr old daughter watching my little ponies. One day, your dad and I will have more in common. Remember this and things will turn around for you. 




 From what you have said you are already -okay- with it. It's just the option of having a place to run to should you need it. Thats's easy to fix, find another place you can claim as yours for a few minutes/hours whatever you need. 

Library.

Coffee shop.

Another friends place. 

Always options. You will be fine. 




  The publishing game is truly one of the most ass backwards businesses...

You got me there. I would argue this if I could even think of a way to...

It just takes a single look at the rise of indie titles to see how the tides are shifting...even if slowly. 




 Losing control of your work isn't what you should be looking for in a contract. I know this goes against all common sense as an author, but you can decline a contract...If your publisher doesn't consult you on changes, makes all decisions for you, and treats you like the janitor...find another publisher. There are lots out there, and if your work is good enough for one, another will be interested.

Of course, on the other side of the coin, if this is all fine with you, hand over your labour of love, kiss it goodbye and start pushing a work that may or may not be what you started with.

Oddly enough, almost everyone who has responded to my comments are making great points for going Indie. I hope the OP is still reading them. 




  My publisher does no marketing...

That line alone makes my mind scream - find a better publisher! - 

Other than the advance, there would be no reason to even use them. 




 What other field should I pull my advice from if not the range of my own experience?

I class any traditionally published author as lucky, whether they have to push their own work or not.

I do believe many publishers are encouraging their authors to push their own work, after all, more sales are better for everyone. Yet, sometimes the time could be better spent creating more works for the masses that are waiting for it with baited breath!

(All readers still wait with baited breath right?) 




 I guess it would depend on who you are trad pub through. I have many author friends that actually are told to write and leave the promo to the people who are paid to do it. 




 There is some, thing, on the, wing... ( sorry couldn't help it.) 




 If you have unlimited time and energy, I say go indie. 

If you are human, shoot for traditional. 

This coming from an indie author...you spend %90 of your available time trying to find more ways to promote your work, and much less time actually writing it. If you expect quick cash from indie, think again. You really have to work for your sales and even a small lapse in promotion can make a big change in the trickle of sales you might have.

Of course, some indies do great.

Just not this guy...yet. 




 Up vote from a guy with a goatee and has nicked the edges of more times then I can count. 




 Okay, so straight out...I assume you are barely over 18 if at all, but when you were (are some day?) Have you ever felt an attraction to any younger woman, at all. Yes or no will suffice. 




 And the exact opposite is implied by yourself.

You seem to think that even though you never thought like this ever, (really?) that everyone else must not think that way too.

Or you willing to admit you are human now? Unless...you are the 18 yr old in question, then your reluctance to admit human nature makes much more sense. 









 No...I said in my experience...

 You are including the world.

And now at the age of 40, I know that this is still true more often than not.  




 You mean to tell me that you weren't? Or you aren't a man...please. Lie if you like. Whatever makes you happy. I controlled myself, like many others, but to deny the fact, that's just sad. 




 Or she has a few of her friends over to have a -talk- with him...or not...just speaking as a dad of a soon enough to be teen daughter.

PS: I was an 18 yr old boy once, we can't be trusted...even though I was raised with morals, I still knew what I wanted. 




 Being on the front page of Reddit... oh wait, that wasn't a dream!

 All works on Amazon are a hard sell as an indie author. Do the shore sell better than my full story at 96k? No, but no worse either.

When I released them, Amazon had no option for distinction, they were just e-books. 




 Books 1-4 of the jumper series are all independent, yet best read in order. Book 5 ( in the works) pulls all the characters Introduced in the first 4 together, with resolution. Books 1-4 are 10-14k each, and 5 is slated around 42k long...after I have released 5 I plan on doing a full collection. Perhaps 6-12 months later. 




 Basically, if nothing is happening, why does your reader have to know it? Is what the character eating important to the story line?

If it doesn't progress the story, consider cutting it all together. 




 Very Welcome! 

Hope you enjoy it, and the book too!  




 He was doing it, koodo's alone for just that. 

And front page in 22 minutes. Don't know it that's a record or not, but dang...
 









 I took a different approach. 

I have 1 story, broken into 5 parts. I released each part as it finished (10-14k) and am working on the final chapter (roughly 40k, and by chapter I mean...ending)

While they are away with edits, I work on other projects, and am almost ready to release another 42k story.

It's not that hard if you don't mind having a couple irons in the fire at the same time. 




 I don't want your gold, hit up my books on Amazon instead and buy some of my books, cheaper and we both win! 

 




 Once you get enough works out, you can drop one to free. That way you can always count on a couple numbers on your Amazon page. Works for me anyway. Might not get paid, but not as depressing as that brown bar. 




 Raising a child is a decision. I too have had to make the same one, but from the other side. While to this day I still wonder what might have been, I regret, yet don't, my (our) decision.

Did you do what's right? 

No idea.

Did I?

No idea.

I am glad that you were smart enough to think before you made it, and not do something foolish...yet :-) 

Enjoy your life, plenty of time for children later on if the opportunity comes again. 




 Be very clear on your POV shifts, be it with new chapters, larger line breaks, or using dialog tags. Readers are easily confused if you don't make it clear. 




 And what was the point of this? To try and drag someone down? Maybe...just maybe...they won't try again.  




 I think it might be flooded... 




 Don't thank me. It's all you.  




 And with the smile he gave you, your beauty only increased. Enjoy your day, you are gorgeous. 




 Or don't take any breaks and plow ever forward. My first work I took breaks and never finished it. Some people write better all at once, never stopping. 




 Well I would be honored if you decided to grab one of mine some day. 




 **********-********-**********-*********

I used a number hider so you have to use your memory. :-)  




 I can make up stories inside my head and people pay to read them. 




 Bah...Amazon is always missing my books...when will they ever learn.

(Hey, I did hit the top 100 a couple times already this year! Just not for long...)  




 You are still breathing,
Your heart is still beating,
You haven't given up yet.
Keep moving forward
One step at a time.
You can start with sharing your art.
I, for one, want to see it.

I wrote poems when I suffered with depression. They are gone now, but they helped me with perspective. Art doesn't have to be everything to everyone. It just has to speak, someone will listen.

Now I write books. My angers and fears are found in thier pages. My art gives the escape when I need it.

Don't lose yours. 




 Speaking as a man that dated those girls, you are much better off. 

And koodos on the writing! That too is a hard road. Let me know if you ever want to swap a story. 




 Really? With the username gingerkid1234 you ask this? 




 "Think" 




 That's odd...if you pm your email, and choice, I will email you it tonight. 









 In the malls, book stores, coffee shops... 




 Great read, I honestly had no idea, and I consider myself rather well read...Thank you! 




 Hmn...And yet I see more people reading in public in the summer time. Maybe Canada is backwards in this...or we all hide when it snows... 




 I have heard it can help...course...it doesn't "always" help... 




 It's funny how easy it is to say, just do this...yet in practice it can be so far from easy.

Reviews - Check, plenty of great, and honest, reviews on my work. General concencuss is that -I are a good writer- ;-)

Covers - Meh...I have them. Could be better.

Categories - I cross genres a lot...did the best I could

Marketing - Limited budged and time. Every minute pushing is a minute not writing, working on the balance constantly. 




 All my works are still available via Amazon, and they have finally (took over a year) price matched one of my works for free. Unless you live in Canada, then it's still full price. Figure that one out...
 




 This time of year?

Never thought of book sales as having a best "time". What would be the best for pushing my next work that's coming out?

December? 




 No, my works are still available...and yes... under KDP Select, they willl "push" your work for you and submit it to others via email and the like...

I can't say they are, but I can't say they aren't either. You have to be pretty naive to think that in today's world things like this won't happen.

Is it happening to me? No idea...no way to prove it either way. 




 In short, I have been self publishing for over three years. I have used KDP to give away and do some small promo's with my works. My best month was last December when I put a really large push. I had over 5000 downloads of my works, all free.

Since that time I have seen a steady drop until this month where my books are almost at a dead stand still again.

Amazon sent me a letter that I had to remove my works from other markets, as they were in conflict with the rules of KDP. (They, Amazon, have changed the rules so many times now since I started, I just ignored them until caught. Yes, I know, my bad.) In response I told Amazon to remove all my works from KDP and they agreed.

As of that day, I have not seen a single sale of my work.

Have I been blackballed for not playing nice with Amazon?
Has anyone else seen results like this?

What are your thoughts on it?

(For some reason Authors have a very hard time coming clean with actual numbers of book sales. I don't have that problem, but I can understand if you wish to be vague about your own. It's your choice of course.) 




 You killed my father! Prepare to die... 




 A law enforcement officer is not exempt from laws. They will be ignored though if you ever decided to try and press a charge. The officers have no magic powers that make them able to do things any safer than the rest of us. 

Google how many times a police officer has caused a car crash and you will see what I mean. 




 Stop and look inside the next cop car you see, they have so many gadgets inside it's a wonder they can see outside the window. This photo might have been a fake, but I have seen many officers use a cell while driving. 




 Keep it minimal, unless those doors REALLY matter... 




 If you find yourself using the word -I- all the time, drop it. It's the best way to avoid poor first person writing. 

No-one wants to read

I walked to the store.
I opened the door.
Inside the store I looked for the poptarts.
I paid too much for them, but I like them enough to do it anyway.

Of course, sometimes -I- is unavoidable, but use it sparingly. 




 It only took five beats from the moment he jumped, but those seemed an eternity.

One.

The wind punished Aiden, shoving, and wrenching at his ruined clothes.

Two.

His arms stretched out, the magic built around him forming a bubble in time.

Three.

The scene of potential death burned itself into his memory, even with eyes closed.

Four.

In an instant a tunnel opened, seemingly to pass through the air itself.

Five.

*****

Aiden and Jess were only working on a science experiment to prove that the speed of light could in fact be broken. What they didn't expect is what would happen when they actually did it.

Time itself factures and Aiden is thrown forward into a future where humanity seems to be gone. Plants and animals survive, but the planet is in ruins. Through fate and a little help of magic returned, he manages to find a way to jump into his own past, and attempt to correct what he broke.


With each jump back Aiden unknowingly pulls someone else into his future. Those lucky few also find themselves with new power to go with the changed world. 




 9: And the government does not listen in on your cell phone calls...oh wait... 




 Not with a roar, but with a whimper. 




 Search out the new texture mod, you will fall in love all over again! 




 Mine-sales, rather be a paid author...working on it. 




 At 40 I suddenly feel much younger, thanks! 




 Old man? I just turned 40! Guess that's like 120 in Reddit years... 




 I am still stuck on step 23... 




 You can skip step 7 and just change it to -swear you will never write again- 




 Oddly, mine would be around the 10 mark as well. And I never want to read it again...okay maybe one day, but one day long from now. 




 It was a dark and stormy night. 




 True, but I do give him points for the attempt!  









 You can get it for a buck or so here...

E-book first I found was a hundred bucks, didn't sound right to me. 
 









 Some mornings I feel like it, but no...not 89. 




 Welcome, life is a journey, and sharing it with some one else can make it even more rewarding. 




 The ring of the phone faded into the back of Tara's mind. It was an older phone, heavy, with a rotary dial, and in a shade of light green that was once popular. The color had always reminded her of pea soup, the kind her long past grandmother used to make. The ringing would stop if she left it long enough. It always stopped, and she always ignored it.


Sitting in an old chair, its cover ripped and stained, her arms stretched out, she felt the coarse material under her. Her skin was only a shadow barely seen. A window showed the only light in the room, the faint glow coming through it. She pulled the darkness in close around her, a comfortable friend.

The weatherman had been right about the rain, for once. The steady dripping against her windowsill comforted her in a way she couldn't explain. It tapped out a rhythm matching the heart beating inside her chest. The two intertwined, leaving Tara unsure where one started, and the other ended. The weak light from outside showed the tiny rivers of water cascading down along the glass, hoping to join their brothers and sisters again in a sea of lost friends. The tears they made in their brief visit to her world reminded her of those that fell down her own face. Untouched by humanity, they left only faint traces, as they too escaped to join new friends of a different color, pooling on the floor.

The cold Tara felt was not from the window, or from her dark room. It was a chill from the inside. Others had told their last story and she had drunk the words. Always thirsty for the knowledge they released before the end. She knew this feeling would come, a familiar friend and a welcome one.


Eyelids became heavy for a moment, blurring the window before her, its surface still heavy with rain. She longed to see the heavens one last time, but the streetlight outside stole the night sky from her, the dark clouds blanketing the sky. The faint glow from the street lamp pierced the rain on the glass, creating a million stars shining in front of her eyes, before her slow, tired blink wiped them clear. A smile broke on her lips touched with a blue from her spreading inner cold.


Fingertips painted a slow river of glistening red. They dripped down in a rhythm unlike the rain, painting a poor canvas stretched across the floor. She thought the drops were falling slower than they should. They landed at random, uncaring whether they matched the patterns created around them. A drummer, who played his own beat while the rest of the band played on.


She took a deep breath, and felt sudden warmth. Tara had done all the research, and they hadn't gotten this right. Her fading mind enjoyed the sensation. It spread from inside, like that first sip of a hard drink, a falsehood that promised comfort, but never delivered.


Her eyes were heavy again, and her vision sprinkled with hints of diamonds, the window a blur. The phone rang again, a distant sound, farther than the blood, farther than the rain. They faded as the darkness took over.


The rain stopped. 




 Listen to each other.

Don't expect some one to change for you if you aren't willing to change for them. 

Take some time for yourself every now and again.

Talk, about everything, always.

Never, ever, end a day while still angry. Even if it means staying up all night.

Remember what you fell in love with in the first place.

Know that people change as they grew older, the trick is to be try and change together, and enjoy each others changes. 




 My wife was 20 when we met, 9 years later and we are still going strong! 




 I have given myself tingles...but not cried. Least, not yet. 




 Find a writing partner. Set goals for each other and have incentives to get them accomplished. Exchange your work with a set deadline to keep the pace up.

If you don't have someone to work with, and you are left working alone, perhaps you need to get into a set routine. -This- is your writing time, and you make it so every day. After a few weeks it will become habit and your problem should be solved. 




 I have a close circle that has access to my works in progress, as well as some -teasers- I have been known to toss up on twitter and FB from time to time. Helps keep the interest up when you have nothing new to release. 




 Did not realise this was a repost. Sorry, just saw the news myself. 









 Not a mechanic, but am the guy who sells the parts. Chevy...any Chevy and we have the parts for it on the shelf. Imports break the least. There is a reason Chevy almost went bankrupt and Ford is the #1 seller. 




 Slurm! 




 My biggest struggle is exposure. I can write, people tell me they like it (even strangers!) Yet, I can't seem to break out of the couple of books a month in sales. I blog, I tweet, I hop...yet finding readers takes so much time, I rarely have enough to write.  
























 That's because you actually have to work to get to Carnegie Hall. 




 Store is busting with savings! 




 Only when you are happy with your story can you just shift to simple editing. Unfortunately as an author it's hard to ever say "I'm done!" When you can upload another version in a matter of minutes.  




 And as a gif it all plays at 2Fps. 




 Every work I have done uses multiple POV's. Keep them clearly defined and you will have no problems. 




 It isn't a big deal. It's your choice, and I have known many couples that are happy with that choice.

It wasn't the same for me, but that was my choice.

You get one life, live it the way YOU want. 




 Brandon Sanderson is a good start,
Or an unknown indie working on breaking into the field,
Jamie Heppner.

Both are available via amazon. 




 Populus?
 




 Novel is done,

Sales are slow,

Need more readers.

Promotion didn't do near as well as I had hoped.


Sadness had followed. 




 Was one of the biggest jokes in Canadian history.

I actually dated one of his friends...guy was a chronic smoker. 

However, pot is not a enhancing substance, if anything it slowed him down.  




 Still think it's a joke? 









 Perhaps re-read your own post, and the follow up posts. You will soon find that I never said it was the (best show ever)

I did however question whether or not you actually watched it.
As for the reasons I love it? 
I found it entertaining. 
I connected with the characters and felt the loss when they were killed in the wrap up movie.
I saw a story line that was only given the shortest of time to scratch the surface of potential.
However, that doesn't mean a damn thing to you, and it shouldn't, because it's my opinion. AND your thread asked for that. 

Anything else you want to try and ditch me on? 




 Well I can understand from what you have said why you wouldn't enjoy it. After all, reading the last chapter of a book first is the best way to truly enjoy the work.

And all the reasons you just cited why you didn't enjoy it were a great argument for your own case...


Oh wait. 




 Do you really need to ask that? 

By your question alone we can tell you have never watched it... 









 As a little back story. I have been an e-book author for a long time. After more than a little pushing by my friends and readers, I decided to get one of my books into an actual physical copy. 

It's been a long road, but I am glad to say I've made it! Now, off to finish up the next one and get it paperback ready. 









 I start with the basics. Who are the players, what are they doing, and what just went wrong.

From there all you have to do is try and keep up. 




 If you were to take away most technology, you would end up back in a more western setting. That being said, if you were in an eastern society, you would end up in a similar situation, with an eastern twist of course.

A good read with a modern twist is -The Event- dystopian future mixed with fantasy elements and historic elements for flavour. 




 I just read this thread and its replies, I am sorry but what I see is you have an opinion on writing and you wish evyone else to see things your way. Unfortunately, there is a time and a place for using the word -said- in your writing. Some people may over use it, others might ejaculate another word in its place too often. The only right answer is to use it whenever you feel like in your own writing.

If I have only learned one thing in my writing life it would be...

Write the way you want.

For every person that loves what you do, there will be two more that think it's crap. 




 Actually, that would be...Well, that's emarrassing. 




 Eat your vegetables.

#Shiver 




 You might want to look closer. Here if a child is removed as an infant it is often the case that foster parents raise them for life. Might be worth looking into. 




 I don't know what country you are in, but if it is in Canada, you might want to look into a foster program. You can foster a child from shortly after birth, and in many cases it turns out to be long term/life. 

I know it isn't the same, but...? 




 2011

Yes, Rabies kills. 

So far there is only 1 case of anyone surviving. 

Well done.  




 First thing, use double enter to put a break in your paragraphs, this will make that wall of text a lot easier to read.

Just like that.

Edit up that mess, and we will look again. 




 If you set all this up in word you can see the page count, or else just put it into Createspace and it will tell you the page count as well.  




 Yep, and I just replied to her. 




 2500 up front, but later he was paid 400k, of which he got exactly half. Still about 399453 more than I have made from selling my works. 




 If you have time to sit here and use reddit, you have time for a part time job.  




 I am really sorry, but without a day job to pay your bills, odds are you will not make a living as a writer. I have been writing for almost 6 years and I don't make much at all per month. Almost every dollar I do make goes back into my writing somehow. 
Perhaps it will all change now that I have actual paperbacks coming out, but only time will tell. 
Keep writing, never stop, but don't expect to get rich from it. It just doesn't happen very often. 




 You rock!

And speaking for my wife, who has the same problems with her mother, I will point you out to her in the hopes your story can offer her some inspiration. 









 4 over the last 5 days? How are you still sane?  




 As long as they remembered their towel, everything will be okay. 




 I have done some extensive beta reading, if you need another please send me a PM. A couple pages to my email, and I can show you what I can do. 




 You are far too enlightened to simply be a cab driver. 




 Write a book. Seriously. You might not get rich, but I wouldn't mind reading it. 


If you don't know how to write one, talk to me, or one of a couple hundred other authors on here to help you. 




 Shhhh, don't cry. 




 Most of my family doesn't read, or care, about what I write. The few who do understand that I am writing a story, not a personal diary. 

Give them a shot, you might be surprised. 




 A picture of a hand pushing through a reflection in a mirror, while still showing the reflection. 




 On the rims, maybe. Practice a bit on something else to learn how far away to hold the spray can. Too far, mist. Too close, runs.

Calipers don't matter as much, hard to see, and if you do have runs the angles will hide any poor spraying problems. 




 Google + YouTube.

However, cleaning is key, specially for the calipers. As for rims, clean and a good etch primer is a great place to start.

More prep you do, better result you will get. 




 You are 19 and you just learned your parents have sex...

News flash son...you were created somehow. 




 BC has some of the highest taxes anywhere. It cost me $1.76 just to type this.  









 As far as I have found, KSP is the only conflict I have found in self publishing. 




 Nailed it. 




 I think you have missed the point of this anology.  




 I think it's more like the ideas are the blueprints. Houses and foundations can be fixed. Blueprints are worth only the paper they are printed on.
 




 I have a core of 4. I don't anyone to tell me how awesome my work is, I know it has flaws. I just need my beta readers to rip it up and tell me what doesn't work. Honesty is worth gold when you have to depend on others. 




 No. This was just taken yesterday. Mama wasn't happy to see us, lots of huffing and stamping. 




 Funny, I will tell that to my wife... 




 Canadian here, we wave and say hi.
 









 Have you ever passed on a book to only have it succeed elsewhere?  




 At least they didn't explode...

Next time, used computer fans for cooling, quiet and run off cheep rechargeable batteries.  




 This is the best thing I have seen on Reddit in a long time! Awesome!  




 Missed the title somehow. 

The book is called "Mirror Thief" And will be out soon in hard cover and e-book.  




 His parents ignore him.


His motorcycle is trashed from the accident.


He has nowhere to sleep, no money left, and no job to earn more.
With few options open to him, Dario's future is dark, and depression is sneaking around the frame of his world.


That is until his fingers push through the boundary of the reflection in front of him, and he learns that he can move through a world others can only see.


Now... can he use this to fix the errors of his past, or will crime be the only option?
 




 -The Event- By J. Heppner on Amazon. 

It's got a little of everything in it. I hear that it's even going to paperback in the next month or so... 




 My wife is a SAHM and she works a lot harder than I do. It's a tougher job than most people think, and you should take pride in the fact you appear to be doing it right. 




 He's got my vote, and I will read (and have) anything he puts out. If someone were to compare my writing to his, I would take it as a big complement. 




 Or you could have clicked the save button way up top instead of getting down voted... 




 Level up armor, weapons, and spells...you can still do it. Just makes you win worth more solo! 




 Depends on if you do bosses solo or with help...everyone has a harder time with diff bosses. 




 I'm still stuck at the hundredaire...perhaps one day I might see the thousandaire...time will tell. 




 Plenty of good advice already, so I will just inject the humor...

Bbbrrraaaiiinnnsss.... (said in a zombie slur) 




 Maybe you need to step back from the screen now and again. Sounding a touch too hurt for something -you- have seen before. 




 Inconceivable that two people could have the exact same thought, at different times. 




 Hit the friend button, say thanks for the help, and see what happens. 




 -The Event- has a touch of that, thrown in with some Apocalypse terror. 




 You know where the breaker panel in your house is?  




 Check your breakers, reset the one that has the hot water tank on it. 




 My wife and I just left the theater, and almost every person left their garbage behind. When did this become okay? Are we a civilization of slobs that just simply expect others to clean up after us?  




 Do. You. Have. A. Canoe. I. Could. Borrow. Please. 




 It doesn't matter what you saw at the end, all those memories you just shared are what made him special.

Wherever he is now, he knows you miss him, and loves you too. 




 Fuck. That. Shit. You are perfect the way you are. 

If that's all people care about, you are with all the wrong people.

You need someone to talk to, let us know. We are all people just like you. 




 Yes, worst faceswap in the history of the sport. Not my doing... 









 You sound like a budding author. Time to dig out the pen and paper. Get those raw thoughts down! 




 Poorly, I mostly look at cat pictures. 




 Word of the day toilet paper.

Someone had to put some humor in! 




 Nice to know I have been outselling at least 1 other other on Amazon. Sorry I don't really have a question for you...yet. 




 I think you missed the link you intended to add. 




 Longest loading gif ever... 




 It took me almost four years. I started with over 25k in debt, at about 21 years old. 

And a general labourer is a decent trade. Throw out an add in craigslist for a helping hand worker or try to find a roofing crew. With effort you will dig yourself out. 




 What skills do you have?
Side jobs for cash can make a big difference.

It will take work, but you can do it. I know so, because I have done it. 




 If I plan ahead, it never gets done. My characters tend to write themselves if I just get them started. 




 You mean ' It are wisdom are irrefutable' 

I will show myself out. 




 You need to meet my wife, she had to do this exact thing. Congrats! You are on the right road. 




 That's awesome! Small steps and never give up! 

The power of the mind is an amazing thing. 




 There is a piece of me in every one of my works. My wife can find them easily, but a general reader would never know.  




 Congrats! Now on to the next 100k :-)  









 Oddly, I don't. But! I was looking through old photos and screen shots and saw this. Made me laugh, it was still in the good old days of WarCraft. 









 I will have to give it some thought. Down side to pushing it is the bad press, and do I want this guys phone number in one of my books if I have just taken him to court? 




 I can't agree more, that's why I was so surprised he agree'd to do it this way from day one. He even approached me in the beginning. I didn't search him out. Sucks. 




 I have the written emails, as well as the chat logs online. He changed his mind. Can't afford his price, can't afford a lawyer. 




 It was supposed to be for recognition only. His name would be on cover, with phone and contact info inside. 









 My wife and I have been together for over 9 years, she sounds a little like you. She didn't much care for my flirtatious behavior, but has learned that it is just my personality. She is the one for me, and always will be. I don't want anyone else.

You are off to a good start by expressing your feelings, now, take everything you just wrote down, and tell him that.

Even if you have to show him the post, or copy and paste and print it out for him. 

The words will do you more good if spoken to the right person.

If he is as good as you say he is, you will be fine, and you both with grow a bit and move on in your joint relationship. 

 




 I hit up one of my local writing groups once, I was the youngest there by about 20 years at least ( I am 40) they were all very nice, but not much into what I was looking for.  




 No. They said without evidence, it must be disregarded. Aka without evidence, it doesn't exist.  




 Were you born in the 1800's? 

If you can't see something...it must not exist? 




 Just because you don't believe in something, doesn't mean it's not real. No matter what religion you follow, there is a punishment for wrong. Unless you are agnostic, in that case, it wouldn't matter either way. 




 Good for you! -sorta- As far as the car is concerned, if you want to PM what parts you need, I may be able to help some. (I am in the business)  




 Go out, find someone out there that is worse off. Do something nice for them, ask them what they need right now, the most. Doesn't have to be big.

Here is the hard part.

While you are doing it, watch them. Watch their face, reactions, find the feelings you are missing inside you, in them. You might find a door inside yourself open just a bit. If it does, don't slam it shut. 

Do it again. 
























 Please look into the adoption route, if you are in Canada west coast feel free to PM me and I will offer any help I can. Heck, no matt where you are PM if you wish. 




 Your friend is beautiful. I see nothing wrong with her in any way.
 




 Your readers are smart people, they will understand the implications with very little input.  




 Your oil change is overdue... 









 History is written by the victors. Do you really think that they will honestly tell the entire truth, or the truth at all?  




 And there is a Montrose in Canada as well...BT we have the T-Rex here. 




 No, you can start on the last day, just have to type fast! 




 Hopefully my next one, I can see it in my head, I just need to get it made! 




 Even though I make less than 10 bucks a month from my writing, I still do it. Even have another book coming out next month. I love making the stories. If I make money one day? Great! If not...maybe my kids will proffit from it, or at least have something to remember me by. 

Either way, the stories will always continue. 




 Book one on Amazon is called Past Jumper. Would love to have your take on it.  




 Thank you! 

The first book is actually free on amazon right now, I am editing the last book (5) as we speak. :)  




 Time travel, shielding, flight, pyromania, healing unfortunately the world isn't sticking around long enough for any of it to last. 




 Thank you. Every one helps. 




 If you could also share my page on Facebook or any other media, I would be very appreciative.

 My mental capacity will degrade in the coming years, it's one way to leave something for my children, and perhaps they will reap some financing from it as well.  




 I remember. 




 So, nice pictures and all, but what books were you reading? Any chance one of them was one of mine? 




 This is the warning on the back of some very "offshore" lights that the store I work at has started selling. 

I feel like I am going to have a hard time standing behind this product. 









 As a general rule, linking your work like this is frowned on by Reddit. I speak from experience. You would do better to find another method of promotion.


And yes Anal? Is this supposed to be a XXX story? 




 So far the longest I have had published is at 96k. A touch under the majority, but I still think it's plenty. 
Have a few sitting at the 40-80k as well.  




 Yeah, no. 




 I read that as ponies...Still one you don't want to listen to.  




 Why is a good question. It keeps you sharp. 




 I auth - therefore I am... -er- 




 I am an author, insanity runs in my blood...and they let me out on a day pass...so back off!

;-)  




 If I couldn't control them, it would be very hard to type this from under a semi truck wheel... 




 That's why I started writing. At least computer time has a purpose now.  




 The consistant ones can be hard to ignore.  




 I am having a hard time thinking of a use for it...but it's better than none at all! 




 They are all mine, just the public and the not public sneak out sometimes.  




 This one! So much this one... 




 For instance, I was just walking down the street and a semi drove by really close. I thought, "Hmn, it would be super easy to dive under the wheels" Of course, that would be counter productive. But the thought was there. What random thoughts have popped into your head during the course of a day that are totally not your norm?

(I am by no means suicidal, it was just the thought.) 




 I will have to start squirreling away some money, thanks for the input. 




 The reason I have chosen to be an indie is that I am lacking in extra $. What I do have goes to debt, or bills. Spending more on promotion isn't an option. 




 I am an author. I have many books out and more coming soon, yet I am seriously lacking in the exposure side of my work.

Things I have done are:

- blog release
- tweets (many)
- Facebook promo (shares, promotions, giveaways, paid promotions)
- local promotion, friends, word of mouth.
- Reddit ( limited, self promotion is frowned on, I know)

I have the work, it's available, people like it, yet I am lacking in growing my reader base.

Anyone have some suggestions on things I might have missed? Or is this it for me? 




 I text them to my wife, no-one cares if you text things. 




 Yes, I need a trailer too. But, I still need my limbs. 




 I have had some very good experiences there. 
 




 Bring that photo over to r/redditgetsdrawn something tells me you will love what they do with it. 




 May 19 is my birthday. I will remember. 




 Just getting my flair! Yay for books! 




 Awesome. Thank you :-)  




 That's beautiful. Thank you very much. 




 Give it to ten complete strangers and tell them to be honest.

Once you have that feedback, look at getting it out the farther. Until then, go write another one.

 




 Great line of thinking, would make a very interesting story. I will have to keep this thought of yours in mind and see if anything developes.  




 If you are still giving out flairs, I would just love to have "Aspiring Author" as mine, but since I see it's not a choice, I would be happy to have "Mirror Thief" as my second choice. 

It's the title of my latest work. Mirror Thief.

And Mirror Thief, since advertisers say you have to say something at least three times for it to lodge in your long term memory. 

Thank you :-) 
 




 Normally around 1000 per hour, but when I get in the "zone" I have topped at about 1500. It helps when I am writing an action scene. Those go faster...

Hence why I try to write in a lot of action. 




 And I am glad you did. Thank you, it's awesome! 




 Love it! Thank you, and I see you snooped back a bit ;-) awesome. 




 Nope, and I thought someone would ask this sooner. It was all done and placed for me. I had no say. 
 




 Jetsons will never die! 
LONG LIVE ROSIE!  









 Very welcome, would always love to have another reader. 




 You got it.

 I will cross my fingers for you.  




 Ahh, I thought you had seen mine in it, sorry, I was confused. ;) 
 




 Bother. Do it, if you don't try you have already lost. 




 I will be looking into that asap, thank you. 




 Really? Pardon my ignorance, what is Books-A-Million? Do you have a link? 




 It all starts with one. :-)  




 That is a big deal too, thank you! 




 Thank you! 




 I did. It took a while to get it right, but in the end I used Createspace. After that it was a lot of personal contact, pushing my own sales and making friends with a lot of people. Sadly, you can't (normally) just write a book and hope it will get out there, you have to sell yourself as much as the work. 




 I find it interesting how I just posted a few days ago how my first novel, The Event, was written almost solely on my lunch breaks. It was the only time in my day I had nothing else to do but sit down.

 




 A couple years ago Amazon left my pricing alone, lately they have beef flip flopping it all over the place. 

Amazon will not inform you when they change the price, you have to watch it yourself, constantly, and it's an incredible struggle to get them to put it back. You lose almost all your rights when you sign up with them. 

I may consider sending that email. Communications with them about my work have been a little painful in the past, but thank you for the suggestion. 




 E-book pricing is generally lower than print book pricing. Yet Amazon takes a larger cut on e-book, so you have to decide to make far less, or raise your price some to compensate.

You get to start the pricing where you like it, but Amazon will change it with no notice to you. I believe you print version doesn't change the e-book versions pricing data all. 




 Thank you! If you like, I have some free works up on Amazon to pass your time with.  




 The joys of being forced to work with Amazon. They control the price structure. To make anything on it at all you have to mark it up, so when they choose to mark it back down for you, it's close to where you wanted it in the first place.

I am showing it at 160 pages though. (Paperback) Don't know why the kindle version is listing it at 111... 




 Huh, front page yesterday...Repost today... 




 Yeah, that's cool. I like that one.  




 Advice...Keep trying, if all else fails, try again. When that fails, try again. 


You are your own worst critic.


And lastly, 


Trust in yourself, and never stop promoting.  




 If you are interested in taking a look at what it is about, please feel free to look it up on Amazon. 









 My first real paper book is available in a real book store. And I am happy to share shelf space with other great authors like Brandon Sanderson and Amanda Hocking. 




 Yeah, the side bar said not to though. I try to be good even if I want to shout READ MY BOOKS! from the rooftops. 

I have been told that isn't very classy. 




 Mine is Mirror Thief, and I am sharing space with Brandon Sanderson. :-) 

Was trying to NOT turn my joy into shameless self promotion. But so be it! 
 









 Losing your walls can be a great way to move on. 

Everybody hurts. 




 Was my first thought...gunna crash back into someone's back yard. 




 Two years during lunch breaks at work on the first one. Bout four months on the second. Many other short stories and long ones started-finished in between. 

Come to think of it, I have way too many stories going on right now. 




 Yes, except I have pretty much gone full indie, so not exceptionally good there... 




 Finding a beta reader who will be honest with you can be a true challenge. It helps if you have no personal connection with the person yet still value their opinion. 

If you do happen to come across a person that fits this bill, you also have to remember that their opinion might not match the masses. That's where you have o go find another 5 of these people and compare all the notes. If they all agree, you have a problem. 

That's why sometimes people just decide to pay people to do it. It's a faster way to the same end. 

That being said, most people, like myself, can't afford to pay people. So when you do get a core group of beta's keep them close to your heart, their input can be immeserable. 




 Maybe we need to get some cross promoting going, hey, every post counts! 




 A caf I can understand, but I sell car parts now...lunch rush isn't related. Sometimes I dream of an office-cubicle job where everyone ignores you. Or for one of my books to take off, either would be nice. 




 And it's always around 11-3 or what we call, eat your lunch cold time. 




 I swear they just mill around waiting for a predetermined time to all rush in at the same time. 


It's a conspiracy... 




 I have been working the same job for 19 years. If I didn't have my family, and my writing, I don't know what I would have done. If you can find a way to get out, do it.  




 What gave it away ;-)  




 If the customers would just stop coming in, I would have so much more free time...but they don't.  




 *this or
Angel...always loved that show. 




 I have a collection of short that is up for free. It has hit the top 100 on amazon a few times. 

Before I put them for free they rarely sold at all. I can't say that they help my other works, but people do give them great reviews. Maybe in time the other stories will start selling better.  




 During the day I help people diagnose and fix cars while giving them the best deals on parts. During the night I am a superhero...or I write stories...one of those is a lie. 




 Incredible! Thank you! 




 Already...That is a win! Love it so far thank you! 









 Sadly, self editing is almost impossible. 

I know.

And I am so stubborn I keep trying to do it anyway. 




 I'm sure there is a reason, or I need to dust off some of those stories I haven't finished and get them up for sale asap! 




 Am I reading this wrong, you book is on sale for 4.99, yet it's only %10 done? 




 Glad to be of help. 




 It's not that hard as long as you work the scenes well. Be clear on your transitions and split the fight only when necc. It wouldn't hurt to have a reason why you shift, a loud noise, or an object moving from inside to out. A thrown chair perhaps? Give the reader a reason to shift from one to another. 




 POV first. I would start with the inside one for ease of structure. Who is seeing it? Are you in third person? How does it start. 

Writing fight scenes isn't that much different from any other scene, with the exception of how much detail to pour in. You don't need to describe the sound his knuckles made as they impacted his front teeth for instance.

Work with your characters, pay attention to the flow and let them tell you what is happening next. Describe that to your reader, and you will have your fight scene.

If that doesn't work. Call over a friend and have them act it out for you while you scribble furiously.  




 Touchy subject much? 




 Bump? Really? This isn't a FB post on a buy and sell... 




 If you ever decide to start writing proffesionally, let me know. I would love to work with you on something one day. 




 You forgot to mention the poop. 









 My son asked me at bedtime, "How much money do you have?"
I have always done my best to be honest with my kids, so I answered honestly, "About $70."
His response was, "How do we live?"

Pretty deep for a 6 year old. 

I work my 8-5 and it pays the bills. I have the dept, same as almost everyone else. I try to pull in money for my family on the side, when I can, yet there is never enough. I write books, my wife cleans peoples shitty houses. We are always living one paycheck to another.

There is never enough.

And I am getting tired of being broke.

I want to throw off my chains of my adult freedom. Yet, I wouldn't give up my life for anything.
 




 I have know a lot of pretty faced women who were very ugly on the inside. If you are truly a beautiful soul you need only wait and the right guy will find you. 

Just be sure you don't trap yourself in your own failing by looking at only the exteriors of the men around you. 
























 It's the clarity of communication. 

Sure we can write - u r da best at or job - and you will understand what I am saying, however it does take a second to process. The same happens when you switch your and you're, sure your mind can figure it out but it pulls you from the moment.  




 Easy yes, generally profitable...no.
I am having one of the best months ever though.

If you can afford it, pay the editor. 




 Look into medications then. Usually there is a reason for behavior like this. And the go to answer is often some kind of chemical imbalance.  




 Is he messing with any drugs? 
Paranoia is a pretty common side effect for plenty of narcotics.  




 I must dropped the price of one of my works as a bonus with the release of my latest book coming this week. Does that count?

Usually they don't drop because of the cost to make and distribute books. If you look into the profit an author makes with each sale you will find the majority are less than a dollar per book. Even at a sale price of twenty dollars.  




 I just reduced the price on my e-book, The Event, if you are interested. It was my first full length novel with a dark side. And I have the full collection of -Future Jumper Series- coming out this week. E-book and print. 

What are you writing? Anything you care to share? 




 Or  a really small man... 




 You might want to take a look at The Event. While I admit I am biased, I did write it with one thought in mind, what if the hero doesn't win?  




 I have 11 titles under my name atm.  




 Books! Course, I write books so I am biased. 




 Very welcome. If you have problems with formating or anything, let me know. 




 Right are all yours. You can publish elsewhere, but if you do read their rules. You might have minor conflicts with some promo offers (Amazon's KDP for instance). No legal issues that I have ever heard of. 




 Www.smashwords.com is your best bet.  




 Reposting something from the front page? #nononono 




 Feel free to add me as a friend here, I will be sure to post it up, or if you wish, pm and I will share my FB writing page with you so you can follow my updates there :-) 




 Book 1 of 5 Free to all! If you like this start to a much larger tale, please take a look for the next 4 books available now on Amazon under the Future Jumper titles. 









 Check out some trailers, or even game play footage. You will be shocked.  




 Yes. 
That being said, it's one of the best games I have played since I was a kid. It brought back the fear of death in a game. 
The risk vs reward.
I crawled around corners, sword in hand and held my breath in the dark.
I count the days till #3 is released.  




 Dark/Demon Souls. You need to play those. Need. To.  




 I am waiting on Amazon to link my books. Sometimes they are as fast as a few hours. Other times, days...I do have some freebies available now if you are interested in checking out some of my writing.  




 It  should have been free. Sorry, I was offline for the remainder of the promo. I will be doing another give away soon so please keep an eye out for it. Feel free to PM on reddit and I will link you to my FB page!  




 Thank you :) They are some of my pretty early works. I can honestly say my writing has only improved since then. 




 Mirror thief. At the end of his rope, Dario finds out he can enter the world inside of a mirro. Now with his new found skill, will he use his power for good or? 




 I will toot my own horn a second. The event is on Amazon, and I plan to have it on matchbook soon. It is a post apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy. 




 Thank you everyone for helping me reach #1 in time travel category! I hope you all got a chance to grab these stories. 




 Just heading to bed, have to work in the AM, but here is a link to the paperback cover coming out this month

http://jamieheppner.blogspot.ca/2013/12/worlds-unbound-cover-release.html 

The blurb on the back does a good job of summing up the 5 independant books.

 




 Free starts at midnight tonight. (Pacific time) Didn't want anyone to miss out, so I have posted a touch early. 

If you still have problems after that, please let me know.  









 Thank. You have your downvote button. Yet you keep coming back... 




 If you are interested in getting to know the person who helped create these works, her reddit username is http://www.reddit.com/user/DanielleDrake/
And I have her permission to post this! 
Thank you for taking a minute to look.  









 I am right there with you. No better time to start than now! 




 Never! It's a challenge!  




 Happy New Year! 









 Damn, your sales are exactly the same as mine! 




 I would say be happy you even got a match. I got nothing at all, no match, Nada. 




 Can't agree more...and even more awkward honeymoon...  




 I am unsure what you are trying to show here?  




 In that order? 




 No,  you have a valid point, and I can see what you mean. I will try to twist it a touch... 




 My wife baked cookies. 
Can't say it worked, but we sold it to that same lady. She told us it "Just felt like a good family home."
 




 Missed the double light. That's bad...
You are right about Francis's line. Didn't sit right with me either, so I am glad to see it wasn't just me. 

I don't care for the last tag line. It did feel...forced. But the worlds unbound needs to be in there somewhere. 




 Jump(ed) removed.

Fire (is) added. 

Have been pointed out to me. Any others?  




 Reddit, you have all been incredibly helpful to me with the work I am doing on may latest book. If I could impose, one more time, on your good graces. Please, take a look at this and simply answer, would you buy this book, or does something in the blurb turn you off.


It started with science, and ended the earth.


Aiden and Jess thought they were only doing experiments with light. They had no idea what would happen when they broke the speed of light while bouncing a laser off the moon. 


Using jumps through time Aiden tried to fix what he broke and save humanity, only to draw others into his ruined future. Each jumped pulled another victim caught in Aiden's bubbles of time.


Jane, her life of torment driving her to suicide.

Casey, an adventure seeker, living life for the thrills.

Francis, always on the run, fire her closest friend.

And Aiden's girlfriend Jess, the reason for him to continue trying even after humanity turns against him.


In this, the finale of the Past Jumper series we find out if Aiden can break out of his cycle, or will the worlds become forever unbound.
 




 They look like a variant of the PH3614 standard fram. So, if it's correct, you have a bunch of import filters, Honda, Toyota stuff like that. From.com might help more. 




 As a follow up, if you are really that hard up for material, pm me, I will send you an e-book for free. Might as well have someone read something. 




 As a struggling author. Damn you.

There is no free. There is pirated. What you are looking for us against the law. There are free things out there, you can find them easily, because they are meant to be found. Hit up amazon, look for free audiobooks. 

If you are at pirate(anything).org or any extension, you are stealing, from authors, like me.

 I signed up for secret santa. I was really looking forward to it. Kinda like way back in grade school when you got to write a letter to someone in another country. It was a good feeling for a time. As Christmas got closer I forgot I had signed up, until later and I noticed I had never gotten an address, a name, anything.

I know I got a confirmation when I signed up, but nothing came for me to send to. 

I am disappointed, I really wanted to put a smile on some strangers face, yet for some reason that I don't know, I wasn't allowed.

I find myself angry, yet I can't explain why. I shouldn't be. I have no reason to be. I just am. 




 Did you have caps lock or scroll lock on? 
Try turning them off... 




 In my work, electricity as we know it completely stops working all together.

 I used an unknown solar flare resetting the entire earth to pre-history times. It worked for my book. And if you do some research in the sun's history, you would be surprised at how easily it could kill us all.

 Use the reset button on your computer, your friends computer is going to need a lot more work though. 
 




 As a man who has been bitten in the past, leave now. If there isn't a way to spend time in the same room as this person, everything you "know" could be a lie. 

I was used and abused for almost a year by a friend I fell for, in the end she was married and her husband and her were using me for personal entertainment.

Cut your losses, move on, find a person who you can see in front of you, smile with, hold hands, and talk to. 




 Well we do have good health care. However, just being up here doesn't make everything better. 

I tore a ligament in my shoulder and it still took over 2 years to get fixed.
If it's just for the health care alone, you might want to look very closely. If you are that hard up, getting a job up here might be tough. Unless of course you are already wealthy. 
 




 As a Canadian, yes. Of course, why would you want to? Isn't that a decision that you should be making from your own point of view? 




 I couldn't resist throwing that in there.  









 You have to DL to watch this? BOO! 




 Blood...She wanted more. 




 It was a strange experience. The minute the helicopter lifted off and left me behind, the entire island went silent.


I could still see the mainland from where I was left on the beach. The white sand disappeared into the starlight blue of the ocean. They told me before they left I shouldn't try swimming for it. I might make it a few hundred feet before the sharks got me. Almost at command, I watched a fin break the surface a moment before silently dipping back below to the depths. With a gulp, I turned back towards my goal, my future, my death.


The sands stretched out in front of me to the line of trees that seemed impenetrable. This was insane, yet given the options it was the only choice I could take.


In a moment of clarity, I remembered the magistrate standing above me as he passed sentence.


"You have been given the black ticket. For your crimes, you have the choice of a swift death now, or the opportunity to earn your freedom on exclusion."
"Exclusion."
I had stammered the word before I could think about what I was agreeing to.


Now I was left to fight against the islands turmoil of genetically modified animals, and twist one into submission, or die trying.


The simple blade they had supplied me with felt heavy in my hands as I willed my feet to move me to the tree line. It wasn't a choice. Death was rumored to live at every bend on this island. The animals here were the remnants of the gene splicing experiments of 2078.


The activists had insisted that the animals not be killed, yet they were entirely too dangerous to be let loose where people could be harmed. This was the compromise. If only the activists knew what the government was doing now. They would shit themselves.


The worst offenders like myself were given the option to try to tame an animal or die trying. I had heard one woman had done it. Yet, rumors were she didn't live long after. If it was the government that had gotten rid of her, or her pet, no one in the prison could tell me for sure.


A branch broke under my foot sending a single shot of noise through the underbrush. Fuck. My palms started to sweat around the synthetic leather grip of the knife. Cows had been extinct for twenty years. Real leather was too expensive to waste on a dead convict.


I scanned the area to see if anything had heard my mistake and only silence came back in response. As I waited for my heart rate to slow, I saw a flicker of movement off to my side. I twisted my head around and was rewarded with the source of the movement.


A squirrel sat on a log stone still and stared at me with tiny black eyes.
I couldn't believe my luck. Since the majority of dogs had died out in the poisoned air sweep of 2029 people had taken to smaller animals as pets. Squirrels had proved remarkably easy to tame, and the new market they created had swept the world with an entirely new field of clothing, toys, and habitats. They were all custom made to fill the void left behind in the pet field. If I was going to have any chance at getting off this island alive, it was sitting right in front of me, right now.


A quick survey of the ground around me left me with a tiny selection of berries and seeds. The guide had mentioned that food was plentiful here. It was a minor shock to see how plentiful. In a passing thought, I wondered why it would be like this with so many animals around, but with a mental shrug, I dismissed the notion, it wasn't important. Taming this squirrel was important.


Careful not to spook him away I first placed a berry on my hand and held it out to him. I watched for a reaction as I carefully stretched my hand forward. Only a gentle twist of the animals head came in response. I dropped the berry and tried a nut hoping for a more favorable result.


With each item I presented, the squirrel only gave a minor shift of his head, not a negative twist, more of a curiosity. Perspiration built up on my forehead as I presented item after item.


It didn't work. I felt my legs start to shake from sitting still for so long and I stared at the squirrel on the log in front of me. In frustration, I broke the silence and cursed the fuzzy fiend.
"What the hell do you eat you little bastard!"
With uncanny speed, he shot forward and bit the tip of my outstretched hand. My leg muscles convulsed as I fell to the side. A tiny drip of blood pooled on my fingertip where the rodent's teeth had broken my skin. The world around me went out of focus as I watched the deep red turn to a purple and then a black.


I tried to move away, but my body wouldn't listen to my mind. I tried to scream, but no words escaped my lungs. Before my eyes completely glazed over I saw the tiny black eyes of the squirrel stare at me from on top of that log. Moments later another pair, and then another had joined it.


As I fell to the ground with a dull thump, I understood why the squirrel didn't except any of my offerings, and that's why food was so plentiful on the island. They didn't eat any of it.
 




 I made so many maps in my youth, it was part of what made the games so fun. I used to keep a binder full of them. Fantasy Star was one I believe, I mapped the entire end dungeon. 




 I handed my controller to my 6 yr old son, and showed him what button to push, he won every fight.  




 You are very welcome! And I think I have it pretty nailed down. I am getting good feedback here, as well as on my professional page on FB. People really like that one.  




 I don't mind at all. However in this instance the lady has some more effects that flip over to the back cover. This sample doesn't show the other side since I was just working on my e-book cover first. 

It does look good, all though somewhat pixelated...any practice is good practice though!  




 Awesome suggestions, thank you. I will really consider this before the final draft. 




 The girl, and the fire, are pivotal in this, the final chapter of the series.

The by has been removed, however I am still working on the cropping. It may (will?) end up as a paperback as well, so the cover image you see has her hand sweeping to the left and an open black area for the blurb placement. I have been playing with fonts, but as of yet I am unable to find one that truly seems to flow. It has been offered I should use a fire, but that...would be too much. 

As for the series # I don't have much choice. I have had too many readers pick up a book out of order and than leave a negative review because it didn't make any sense. If I don't hit a reader in the face with what book number it is, well...

Thank you for your input, it is consistent with almost everything else that I have heard. I will repost a finished product in an update as soon as it is done. Hopefully to better praise!  




 Again, it doesn't apply, but you were honest in your answer...so TADA! 

http://y2jgfx.deviantart.com/art/Randy-Orton-Man-On-Fire-161569370 




 As of right now. No...but you know what...that's an interesting idea. 

It doesn't tie in with the female character that has an affinity for fire...but there is a strong male character who controls the wind. 

I might have to think on that one. Thank you!  









 It is strong choice for many, the one with a human model looked great in my mind, I just couldn't get it to work on the screen. The silhouette sample works as she is blowing fire onto the back cover but the front would be solo for e-book version.

Thank you for your input! 




 Here are the 3 samples I have so far. I have the left images hidden since they don't really need to be shown at this stage. 

What do you think? Suggestions? Ideas? Anything you would change on them? All input welcome.  









 Now #1 in the Time category and in the top 2000 for free! 

Thank you everyone for helping get the word out.  




 You have mail! ;) Enjoy!  




 You are very welcome. I have had fun writing the series.  




 What country? Amazon has some funky rules. I will send you a PDF if you PM me.  









 I don't think so. Just for fun and to learn to plan ahead. My son is showing some decent skills considering he is only six. 









 No, that would be stupid, now wouldn't it.

 I walk past a funeral home every once in a while. I don't know why, but this poem came into my head today and I just had to write it somewhere. 

Thank you for reading taking the time to read it. 




 I do not lie here, this is not me.

My soul has left, those close to me see.

The body remains, the person is gone.

Do not miss me, that would be only wrong.

Be happy in spirit. No matter the cost.

Your heart must be brave, this is only a grave.
 









 And thank you!
I will let you know how the next one goes, I started it four years ago, just picking it up again...who knows, maybe it will be next year?!?! 




 My first book, yes. Two to be exact. 

My second, no, four months.

My third, it's just been finished and took over two years again. 

So...yes, and no.  




 My best friend Plank. It's an old funny video. 









 I switch between them as the story unfolds. It can be done very easily as long as you make the POV shift clear. If you don't you run the risk of confusing your reader base. If you have to, start a new chapter each time and place an identifier as soon as you start the new chapter. 




 I have a story titled The Event, doesn't tell much, just enough. 




 Insert words here 
























 Do whatever you want. If it's intimate put paper over the camera first. If he wants to ask why you did it later, ask him why he chose to film you. 




 Please don't take my realism for pessimism. I just want you to understand your own goal. And yes, there is no reason you can't be published by the end of the year. Start collecting small presses and indie publishers  email adresses right away. The more places you can send to, the better your odds of a follow up and perhaps a publication.

P.S. I know all about the 40 thing, turning 41 in a few months. 




 124 now... 




 Just an FYI there is a subreddit /freeEbooks you can get a lot of hits from there too! 




 You sound like me 2 years ago. First lesson I had to learn was, publishing traditionally takes a long time. Up to 2 years isn't unheard of. If someone accepted your work today, you might be lucky for an end of the year release. 

If you want to send me a sample, I would be happy to look at your work. But my opinion is only as good as you want it to be. Your opinion is the only one that really matters. 




 Everyone is a bad writer.

To someone.

Hell, there is a redditor that went out of his way to DL one of my free works just so he could leave me a terrible review. Just for spite. 

Does that make me a bad writer? Of course not. It just shows the point that no matter what you write, someone is going to not like it. 

Take any one of Kings work for instance, and pull up the one star reviews on Amazon. I will bet you an e-book that he has dozens of them. 

Thing is you really can't tell if you are a bad, good, or great writer until you have written something. Then written something else, and something else. 

So get to writing. 




 One up vote is not enough! Well done! 




 Sorry, you said there was a beach somewhere? Can't see it... 









 And so many of them are reading this and saying...yep! 




 Welcome. Wish I had input to help with your problem, but stress is all around me too.  




 For future reference, add a serious tag to your posts, you can report useless comments that way. 




 #1 is very important, at least 4 weeks...months works even better. 




 Anything by Brandon Sanderson is a good shift. 

David Farland has a nice series as well.

Or Jim Butcher, Karen Miller, or for a free DL right now check some of my recent posts.

 The Event, Post Apocalyptic Sci-Fi Fantasy. Death happens.  




 I'm not counting on fame, I will settle for just being read. Hope he likes them. :-)  




 That would be awesome, and thank you for the read! 




 Very welcome! 




 Very welcome, hope you enjoy them! 




 Thanks. I thought it was a good twist.   




 Listed as free on my end. Here's the direct link.

 Never a better time to release the next book!

Don't have one? 

How about an updated cover. Giveaway gimic. Free cupcakes?

Or do like I do and stand on a street corner begging people to look at my work.

No, it doesn't work either. 




 Sadly the nicest people on reddit are usually the quietest. I'm sorry you had this kind of experience, but unfortunatly there are many out in the internets that just live to shit on someones day. 

Ever want to swap stories, I got some doozies! 




 Why wouldn't he? 
 




 Mirror Thief by Jamie Heppner.

An motorcycle accident is the icing on Dario's cake of bad luck. While recovering he finds he has developed an unusual ability to enter the world inside a mirror. Now, will he decide to use this power for good? Or will he seek revenge for a life of downs, rather than ups. 




 What this post doesn't say is that sometimes you are not offered the choice of a pill at all. You are stuck outside the rabbit hole and there is no way to see how far it goes. 

That's when you have no choice but to stand on a street corner, hold your own work in the air and say to the world, "Am I good enough?" 

Even though the act of doing so will open the flood gates to those who will shoot you down, unplug you from a distance, just because they can. 




 Skyrim. Oblivion.  




 Oh, and thanks for the heartfelt review!  




 You really are an idiot aren't you? 

What else would it be? 

Daft. 




 K.J. Bowlings

Honestly, you really want someone else to pick your pen name?  




 $1000 before I bought my house was pretty cool, but I would have to say.

My wife's hand in marriage tops the charts.  




 Dark Souls. 
Prepare to Die Edition.
 




 And there is red on some of it... 




 I would say, if you find it, tell me...then no-one else. 




 I am in the middle of a free for review stint right now. Out of almost 50 copies taken, I have received 3 reviews. This is actually higher than normal from my experience.

Keep asking, begging, and don't be too proud to throw a tear in there now and again. You need exposure, you have to fight for it. 




 I am taking a chance here. The link is for Past Jumper, for free, all I ask from you is a review. An honest review. After you have done that, send me a note, with your name on the review and I will send you a copy of books 1-4 for free. Unless of course you hate it, then you probably don't want the next 3 books.

Guess I am on the hook then. So, how about it? Want four free books?
 









 Would be happy to!

 Send me a PM I will send you a free ebook from my works. You pick. I understand broke. 




 The Event - Jamie Heppner 

It was written with the thought of...what happens if the hero doesn't win? 




 They are very dark though. Great reads yes, but you might want o start with something lighter. 




 Always one more.

I'm great at finding others mistakes, can't see my own for anything though. Need another look through? Let me know. 




 Thank you. I will think on your words.  




 I have come to expect it. If you even sneeze on a sell-able product near a Reddit post you will go down in flames.  




 Thank you.

The humor part. Well, I tend to have drier humor, so perhaps I should drink more. 

Newspapers. In the internet age, I forget they are still around. Thanks. I will be placing a call or two in the morning.  




 You should see what happens when I actually do post links on Reddit. I have to pour water on my computer to combat the flames.  




 Exactly. And that is why I am in /AskReddit 

And why I am asking.

With no links.

And why there is a Serious tag up top. 
 




 Such bitterness. Are you also, perhaps, a writer? 

A failed writer?

I have met that kind of angst from those who have failed before.  




 I know Reddit well enough that if I start promoting my work on this thread it will be shot down in flames. I am asking for serious responses. As it stands I am getting a couple useful comments. And I appreciate them.

So the question stands, how do you push, without being pushy? 




 As far as the fame goes? Yes. 

There is no such thing as bad press. Pretty sure someone famous said that. Heck...some terrible books have been written by terrible people, yet they sell.  




 I have blog sites, blog hops, local posters, word of mouth, giveaways, freebies, contests from readers, free review copies.

Google + 
Twitter
LinkedIn
Facebook
Goodreads

If there is a place for words, I probably have a post or 200 on it.

 




 Ever posted to books? 
I am asking Reddit, people who read.
I am NOT trying to push my work. No links given. Not a one. 




 Again. I am here asking for useful information. Arms open wide. You are arguing the mental state of a cartoon character. 




 I can't agree more. And I would lie if I said my works were %100 error free. I have had limited success in looking for publication, but the timeline of my life doesn't match the reality of traditional publishing.

I have had works in brick and mortar stores, yet unless I was there to suggest them to others, they normally sat dormant. 

I have spoken with many agents and the norm is for every 5000 applicants, one is chosen. Many great works will go unknown because of a simple typo on page 34. The selection process is that picky.  




 The reviews tell me I have written a good book. The 1k free downloads this month tell me that at least some people want it. 

Brian Griffin is famous, I could do worse than to be compared to him.  




 If I thought I wouldn't get sued by someone for trying to ship a food product, I would seriously consider this as a real idea.  




 It's a book, if you read books you are already on the right track. What is it that makes you pick up a book by an unknown author? Do you?  




 Okay, so how is that done genius? Read the serious tag again.  




 There are literally thousands of great books out there. Unknown books. Those authors are in the same boat as me.  




 Did I give a link? Did I say who I was? This is a serious question. 
 









 My daughter just turned 8 and I am sitting here thinking about taking a promotion at work that will massively increase my away time. My kids are holding back my career and I am fine with that.

It's the lack of money that is going to get this family in the long run. The (Time vs Money) problem will never have a good solution.  




 Looks like no. 




 Telus in Trail BC, cookie clearing worked for one click and then right back to a no load. Looks like Telus has a major problem.  




 I have a free collection on Amazon for another hour and change, I will PM you the link, might be to your tastes? 




 Need a touch more info...
 




 The first book is free via smashwords, but I can't have the collection elsewhere without Amazon getting cranky. I have tried, they got cranky. 









 You are welcome for the freebie, enjoy. 














 EXCELLENT! 

That makes me think, I would be looking very close at this one.  




 It was a sample, an idea, I'm not trying to sell anything of mine. 




 I have my own ideas, thanks. Folder full of them in fact. 

A pitch is for something already written. 




 Nope, not making me want to buy it. Not even a little bit... 




 (Here is an example)

It only took five beats from the moment he jumped, but those seemed an eternity.


One.


The wind punished Aiden, shoving, and wrenching at his ruined clothes.


Two.


His arms stretched out, the magic building around him forming a bubble in time.


Three.


The scene of a potential deadly future burned themselves into his memory, even with eyes closed against them.


Four.


In an instant, a tunnel opened, seemingly to pass through the air itself.


Five.
 









 Metal roof. I am getting one.  




 clatto verata nikto !  




 Mirror Thief by Jamie Heppner is a nice shorter read. 

What about an e-reader though? Can carry 100's of books with ease. 




 As am I. Description is the lense flare in just that right spot of a picture. Or the sun just got in your eyes.  




 I did my 96k in a 6x9 with cream paper, glossy cover, and it looks great. Be sure to keep the font size down too. I average about 10 words per line as a good rule of thumb. You can also fudge the margins a touch to keep your page totals where you want them.  




 My ego is fine. I made an observation. You didn't like it. Nuff said.

You win at life, please collect your congratulatory ribbon on the way out.

*sprays troll-b-gone *  




 I made an observation, a valid observation. 

You response?

No, you are wrong. 

I step down.

You attack again.

I'm not going to respond again?

Shoo troll. Go back to your cave. 

 




 Again, I bow to your incredible skills. Or I could spout off things from google too. Regardless, i yo onl sin lik thi i wil soun wron.

And showing me how much money you make? Are you 12? Can your dad beat up my dad too?

Sounding like a troll here. Leave the young ladies thread alone or do you wish to attempt to prove something else to me? 




 Yes, your training as an industrial electriction obviously makes you an expert at singing.

At least in my first post I admitted I can't sing. Never once said I was an expert. All I say is that when you sing a word and you miss the last letter, it sounds off. 

She sings great. I noticed she missed the last letters often. If I notice, odds are others will. But I forget I am dealing with an expert in the field so I humbly step down. 




 Sorry but THIS is not actual advice at all. In fact, it has no point. Listen to a profesional singer and notice they sound out the last letter of words. It was the first thing I noticed with this young singer and it is a very simple fix. 




 I can't sing worth a damn. You can.

Only advice I could offer is to remember that words have a last letter and it's important to make sure you sing them to. Keep it up, you will do well! 









 I have to agree. Over 2 years on the market and even with great sales my fantasy sits at 15 reviews. It's what I like to write but I have to wonder if there isn't another market that would be better to ply my trade.  




 02 Escape, and no it doesn't.  




 You may notice the mass down votes...this was on front page yesterday. Maybe playing a part in it. 




 My son might have been a twin, the doctors were never 100% sure. It was very early in the pregnancy. 

I'm sorry. I can't feel your pain, but in a little way, I understand. 




 Switch the keys around on the keyboard.

Put a small piece of tape over the earpeice of their phone.

Tape down the receiver button under the headset. 

Plug a remote mouse unto their tower and every once in a while drag it across the screen when they are working.

 




 Awesome! 




 Whip or fork? 




 Mirror Thief - Jamie Heppner

That cat is going places. 




 I would wait until that exact second where the blue of the sky fades into the black of space. Just be sure to have a hold on something as the gravity will be pretty weak and you don't want to spin out of control and ask the oxygen recycler system. 




 Links - they make the funny fun 




 By days I work in sales. And not in a writing field. In fact it's so far from writing it's almost impossible for me to find anyone to talk writing to.

By night? I twist tales of action, adventure, time travel and zombies. 




 If you need help with the edits let me know. I have some work for others in the past.
 




 You got it! And I should be having another freebie at the end of this month. Keeo your eyes open!

http://www.amazon.com/Event-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B007JVCU3S/ref=la_B006N2IJU2_1_12?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1389857663 sr=1-12 



 









 I could be...if I could just sell say...(does some math) about 50k of my books...hey that's not impossible right?  




 Her, actually. And I will be happy to link her page for you. 

https://www.facebook.com/customcovercreations

Tada! Take a look at some of the work/premades she has done. 




 Can't agree more. 

And I know a great cover artist if you in the market! 

(No, not me.) 
























 See above. :)  




 I am an author. I don't hide it, and I don't lie about it. 

Sometimes I have free giveaways. And in all honesty, they are for self promotion. Why else would an author give up his/her work for free?

Readers. Authors need readers. 

I understand the strong feelings Reddit has against advertisers, so I do my best to keep my promo's to the correct subreddits. 

Regardless, on one of my promo's a few months back I used Reddit as well as other forms of promotion (Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and pretty much any place I could post a link) and a certain Redditer didn't care for the use of a forum they seemed to take as their own personal playground. I have been following this persons comments for the last while looking for some kind of shred of decency, a glimmer of hope for the spark of humanity, but I haven't seen it. I had hoped they were having a bad day and I just happened to be the recipient of that. However, in light of their comments since my turn in their spotlight, I just don't see it.

So, they downloaded my free work, created a profile on Amazon, and promptly tried to give all my books a 1 star rating.

They got away with one. At which point a few of my readers decided they didn't want this person to get away scott free and sent out letters to Amazon asking for it to be removed.

In the end it wasn't taken down, but it was downvoted enough to no longer matter as much. But the stir created by my readers was enough to spike my book up into some higher rankings for a while, and that got me a little more notice.

So, their attempt at a personal strike, even though it hurt, (Authors do care about how people take their work. We all want to please everyone, even if it isn't possible.) turned out to be a good thing for a little while. 

My reader list spiked. I sold a few dozen more works than I normally do, and I gained a small amount of money in my bank account. Perhaps the trend will continue, even though I see the ripples fading even now. 




 You. Yes you, the redditer who claims to be "Helping". You used the information I provided for free. You struck out at me in real life and tried to sabotage my work. 

You are a prick.

But because of your actions, I have had the best two months in book sales in a long time. No, I'm not going to be famous any time soon. No I am not going to be rich. But for the next two months I have little more disposable cash in my wallet and it's partly due to your attempt at petty revenge. All because I don't agree with what you say. 

Your hipster wanna be, pot smoking, old before your time, old people watching self can try to hide in the darkness of the internet if it makes you happy.

I see you.

I know that you tried writing, and failed. I can see it in your typing, I can see it in your responses. You have an education and it shows. 

Shame you never grew up.

So again. Thanks. Your little attack had a good outcome. I hope one day you can realize how you actually did help, even though your intent was to harm. 
 




 Already is.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_car 




 Your camera focused on the ground really well. 




 This is Reddit. They want to hear about you but if you self promote you get down votes. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. 




 Past Jumper.

Time travel is hot right now. 




 Or Home World? 




 Perhaps Space Rogue? By Origin? 




 One of the Wing Commander series? It sounds familiar... 




 Remove outside distractions and try a change of pace to a more active read. Of course, a lot of people have this problem when reading. Frame of mind makes a big impact on how you read. 




 Why you gotta be this way? 









 I can think of a couple redditors that have a seat warming up.  




 That is an error code that your on-board computer can use to report the status of the car to you. 

It's saying that hell has frozen over. 




 This is very logical. 




 Next level funny right there! 




 Has more to do with the lighting and the camera itself.  




 Trolls and negative comments get down voted. Under normal settings with 10 down votes most comments get blocked for you. 

You can take my word the trolls are always out and if you leave them an opening , they will attack. 

If you want a sample change your settings. 




 I don't have time to go into depth, but I see you are getting few comments. So here is a quick thought after reading a short bit. 

Right of the bat, look how many words start with "f" try reading that fast...I had to untie my tounge. 

Be sure to read what you write out loud. If you are like me, and know the words by heart, read the sentences normally, but backwards. Last sentence first and so on.

You will soon find some of our errors and sentences that don't flow.

Hope this helps some. 




 Pm me...with your skills I might have something to send your way... 




 I got a WiFi keyboard for my Samsung, but I use it only when I am stuck with nothing else. Maybe it's just my big hands but I work much better on a fell size keyboard. 




 I choose to work today so I can spend more time with my kids later.


You will too. 




 Would help to know a bit more about her tastes? 

Sci-fi
Fantasy
Either of those in tastes I can help, other tastes? Let us know. 




 You can use a PC, cell phone, tablet...pretty much anything electronic these days will let you read an e-book. 




 The Event, by J. Heppner. It's a dark mash up of fantasy with a post apocalyptic twist. Definitely not for the young readers. 




 I think you should be a lot less concerned about the job of security, and more concerned about the major buildup on your cables. 

Discusting.  




 Keep reading. If writing is for you, it will happen down the road. 




 Mirror Thief, by Jamie Heppner

What happens in the world inside of a mirror? 




 I am sharing free stories on Amazon...does that count? 




 Because they are both genres that I write, and I just can't seem to get a break lately? 














 You can't make someone do something like this. Either she will, or she won't. The decision is up to her and her alone. 




 If it doesn't come back up...we will always have our memories to fall back on. 

Who am I kidding. I have the memory of a gnat! 




 Show me where to sign up!

 Was going to down vote cause...enough already...but, can't do it. You win. 




 Future Jumper Series by Jamie Heppner. 




 Okay that does make some sense, still a very expensive way to edit. 

I am going to take it you don't have any beta readers yet. You might want to look into finding a few it will save you some time and money in the long run.

What kind of story is it? 

Did you do cover art as well?

By chance did you think of just printing it out on basic paper and handing those out?

Congrats all the same though! At least you have something in print! 




 You might want to look into Createspace...

That is very expensive for just 10 books, and you are saying it's your proof? You should have just done one book. No point in having 10 books with glaring errors in them. 

Createspace also gives a discount on proof orders so you don't have to spend so much.

Of course, there could be no errors at all, but do you really want to take the chance? 




 So, what part of this is funny? 




 Are you using an e-reader? (Assume yes on my part) send me a PM with your email address. I will send you all 3 of my works. 

Thank you for serving. No matter whos wall you choose to stand and defend. 




 And if you don't want to be naked but are still super hot, feel free to have clothes present, just put them on the floor beside you. 




 I have found that the majority of the buy-return on Amazon is due to theft. 

Of course I can't prove it. Amazon refuses to assist me in searching out the culprits, they just send back letters that say "we actively monitor all returns" aka we know, we don't care. Sadly, not much you can do about it.  




 I have found, so far, every dollar spent for advertising is a wasted dollar. Unless! It is on personal advertising. And by that I mean heading out and printing posters, setting up book signings, the things along those lines are your best bets.

After almost 4 years in self publishing I am just starting to see a monthly income of about 100 dollars. And that is with 3 full titles under my belt and a couple collections of short stories. 

In short, the more you put into your work, the more you will get out. For me, my family and personal life come before my writing, so it is taking a much longer time to build a reader base. 




 Getting it available is easy.
Getting it read is hard.

I have been on the top 100 lists a dozen times and I am an unknown name. I can create spikes in sales with a good stint of advertising, but they always fade after a couple of days. If you think of your writing as a business, that will help. 

But whatever you do, don't quit your day job. 




 Notalwaysright.com The customer is not always right... 




 You might want to look up Russell Blake. We both started writing at about the same time and he really dove into it. His model for success would work for anyone dedicated to the craft. 




 I'll get back to you on this later... 




 Upper left...don't mess with her.  




 Reposting yourself? Fail. 




 So far I have found every dollar spent on advertising my work has been a waste. I truly hope yours aren't and would love for you to update this with some numbers.

I already see you have long list of people marking it as -to read- hopefully it pays off. 




 Welcome to reddit. Where self promotion is frowned at and pictures of kittens and puppys hit the front page. 

If only I could find a kitten to fall asleep on one of my books...be right back! 




 Best to look into an e-reader. Physical books are great but you can't beat an e-reader for travel and large books. (word count) 




 Jumper series.. 

http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Unbound-Future-Jumper-books-ebook/dp/B00HUHM2WK/ref=la_B006N2IJU2_1_9?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1395279069 sr=1-9


First book is free if you want to read a sample.
 




 Very well said. 

As it sits my numbers are so low a single theft stands out. Of course my loss of .25c isn't going to break the bank any time soon, nor will it send me into the depths of dispair. (Pit of Dispair?) 

It's more of the stance of a simple theft. Not many other areas of life allow others to simply take something and people shrug and say, ah well, perhaps others might pay me. 

Sadly the more authors that simply shrug it off and move on, will only make it harder for others to stand and say, "I'm not okay with it."

If perhaps one day if I am big enough in the literary world that I know longer notice a single theft my stance might chance. I will have to wait and see. 




 Oh, I don't go yelling and guns blazing, but every book stolen is money taken from me. And I can honestly say I have never heard, "So I stole this great book yesterday..." Or if they did tell someone and they asked "Where did you get that book from? Oh, I pirated it from..." 

Not trying to be mean, just in all honesty, I feel most people that steal work aren't likely to go tell all their friends about it. 




 Yes. And many friends have as well. Heck, Amazon practically invites it with a seven day return policy. 




 Until you have had your work stolen. It is not flattering in the least. 




 If you do happen to grab this free E-book, and feel like leaving a review, I wouldn't complain. Of course, that is only a request and by no means necessary.

Thanks for the read, and I hope you enjoy another of my giveaways.
 









 Looks like a late night of DS2 for me! I will just repost after midnight. #Noharmdone 




 And lose 8 hours and entire continent. I don't mind giving my work away now and again, but the exposure is nice. Even the negative feedback.  




 Yeah. So not funny.  




 Free promo starts at midnight, no way I will be awake at that time. How might you suggest I reach people that are. Can I set a timer on my post?  




 Is it just me or is giving away something for free getting a lot harder. ^Maybe I should start doing door to door sales...^Oh wait, it's free...can't sell...^Damnit 




 Done. Thanks ;)  




 If you do happen to grab this free E-book, and feel like leaving a review, I wouldn't complain. Of course, that is only a request and by no means necessary.

 And since I just noticed that, I will leave the CORRECT link in the comments. #Sigh

 I will do everything he asks, because it's easy to see, he was a great man. 




 Or do they just want you to think it was abandoned...

 With luck it might be around summer time. Till then, I have other works available now ;) 
(Shameless plug inserted)^Sorry  




 That might have been implied... 




 Sadly, they are multiple files for the complete collection. So...unless I made more than one post, confusing more people, and getting even more down-votes, I am stuck with linking to the main list. When I have a single book available for free, I am sure to post it directly.

Thanks!  




 Fire Jumper...cept it's a girl. 




 Nasa used it and left it in the depths of space, but it's coming back and it's still alive. 




 Having to promote myself for almost no return. My books get great reviews, I have new ones every year but I just can't break the ice and get to the point where I can write more than I promote. 




 Sure, just give me a few minutes... 




 Because you have self published, your work must be crap and full of mistyped words? 

I resemble that remark! 




 I love the .ca being a Canadian myself. What is your stance on previously e-pubbed works?  









 It's a glitch on amazons side. They told me they will look at it on monday...helpfull...so if you wait til tomorrow the collection should be available. Sorry. 




 Some readers are reporting the don't see the first four collection coming up as free, if you don't please look again tomorrow as the promo continues then. 




 Thanks! I understand reader taste all to well, I am a reader to after all. They are my earliest works so I hope you enjoy them. 




 Is she interested in a gig in translations? Mit dansk er rusten... 




 Also...the promo was split between Sat and Sunday on Amazons side, so it might be a glitch in the program. If you wait until Sunday the next promo kicks in and it should work that way.  




 They are saying....grab my free books! O_o  




 Please refresh your browser, it's up as free on my end and people are downloading it as a promo. If you still can't get it to work let ke know in a PM and I will email you a PDF. 




 Yep, we are going for another rip off. Thank you to everyone that grabbed my work last time, you helped me reach #1 and #2 spots on Amazons free sections last time.

If you already grabbed any of my work, thank you again, and nice to see you back! Perhaps you could take a minute to share this link with another site or two. Maybe a cross post? Or a FB share?


Asking too much? Probably...but sometimes it doesn't hurt to ask! 

Either way. Thank you again for the downloads and I hope you enjoy my story!  









 I haven't read the last one yet, the first were so dark, but good...how is it without too many spoilers please? 




 Bitch... 




 You are very welcome. Glad to be here for you. Just remember, a 40+ year olds advice. The shit that seems so terrible today won't even be a memory 20 years from now. Get out and try something new.

You say hi to someone and they blow you off? You are already better off because they aren't worth it if they don't even know how to be nice to a stranger.

Life is short enough, no point wasting it on the small stuff.

You need me, let me know, usually on reddit at least once a day. 




 Don't have to be in a band to be a drummer!

I don't know how many people I have known that just play an instrument to play it. If you have the equipment, slap on some headphones, crank up a tune you like and start drumming.

If you aren't happy with the 'you' that you are, it might be time for something new. Step out of your comfort zone once in a while, and don't be afraid to fail. Actually, some of the best times I have had are when I was epically failing at something.

In the end the sun will come up in the east and go down in the west and you will have another chance to try something else. Even if you aren't any good at it. 




 Depends on your hobbies? What do you do that makes you happy? 
Confidence? Well, that comes with time. I am almost 41 and some days I still don't have it. Other days I do. 
It has a lot to do with your own perception of yourself.

I have had people tell me that they are terrified of me, only because of how I look. I don't think of myself as terrifying but that's just a perception others have. People that really know me know how kind hearted I can be. 




 You are working for money now to improve your life. I don't know how old you are but I am guessing still under 20. You are just starting out. When you get into that new job you will meet new people, make new friends and form new relationships.
Life is just starting to get interesting, and you are in control of your future. Make it a good one and I would be happy to live vicariously through you.  




 The floor is so clean you can eat off of it!  




 English would be a touch more helpful, but I got the idea. 




 The Event by Jamie Heppner, scifi fantasy with a post apocalyptic twist on the norm. It will evoke some emotions for sure. 




 The Event - by Jamie Heppner. Entire book written with that as the underlying theme. 




 I have something for you to read. You should be able to read it without word. Need that email address when you are ready.  




 You need a home copy of word...seriously. Set it up to save to dropbox if you are worried. But things will go better for you with word.  




 Okay I am starting with word for now. You might not see anything until you get back to work, but I will leave comments inside the file. If you wish, you can hit me with your email addy. I should have something for you to look at in the first couple pages.  




 Do you write with Word? If I send you a file that has track changes enabled would you be able to see it?  
























 She is leafing you? 

Damn...that's harsh. 

Sorry dude. 




 It's pretty much up to you. 

Sounds like you did your due diligence and you are off the hook.

Only other advice I could give is, if it's an older tube style TV, they didn't take to temperature changes well. (Sometimes) So if you left them sit to come around to room temperature they would often start working normally again. 

It's my 2c, good luck!  




 Everyone has to start somewhere. You are on the right road.  




 Funny, I feel like I have just had this conversation a couple days ago... 




 I have book one in my TBR pile as we speak. Really looking forward to it. 

So many good books and so little time.

Perhaps one day I will be one of the greats too :)

Or just happy with my own work...either would do. 




 Brandon Sanderson. You can't go wrong with his works.

If you want to try an indie, look up The Event, by J. Heppner.  




 People have started to steal my books and load them on torrent and epub sites for free...

:( 

Now the fun of trying to get them taken down begins, and so this creates even less time for writing.  




 It's a pretty well known fact that almost all authors don't read their own work. Even Stephan King went on record saying that he want's to edit/revise his work all the time.  




 Successful by whose standards? The same people that made the system? 




 OMG! We are all going to be dead!

(Already) 




 Congrats! Best thing you can do now? 

Put it away for 6 weeks or more. 6 Months would be better. Don't even look at it again. Just go write another one. 

When the time has passed, look at it with eyes that will be fresh and see the errors of your ways. 

You won't regret it. I promise. 




 Three! Have another four on the burners at all time.  




 Other than the shocked look, this is pretty much what I was thinking! Thanks! 




 I would like to see a man looking up at a ruined sky scraper-tower, with a German Shepard at his side. In a post apocalyptic world.  




 Oh man! ICQ! I forgot I had one of those, just logged into and BOOM! One of my old friends still uses it. That is so awesome! 
 




 Just before I got this letter I yet again had my books bought and then returned. (Pirated) People do this to me all the time and Amazon expects me to help them with something?

Hell No.

How about this...let me actually control MY OWN PRICES! Let me sell a book for .25 and make .24 in profit. Instead of 2.99 and getting .72c of it. 

You are forcing us to make our books stupidly expensive just to make a buck.

Give us authors a chance to control our work and maybe we will be more willing to help fight one of your battles. 




 A sprinkler....I WILL RAIN DOWN TERROR! 




 And you can sell the wheel barrow for at least twenty bucks! You're ahead! 




 I'm sure she has a big heart though.  




 Listen.

Look her (or him) in the eyes when you talk.

Turn off your phone.

Turn off the T.V.

Hold hands.

Go outside.

Talk to each other and don't be afraid.
 




 Thousands of others....thousands. 




 If you can snatch the pebble from my hand grasshopper... 




 Thank you very much! New chapter here I come.  




 Would love to step up and do what I would like for the next 20 years, but sadly, that won't pay the bills.  




 Sales. I was good at it, always came in with great standings. Customers liked me, just under appreciated.  




 And it feels great.

They cared so little about me that they didn't even bother to say a word about it. I will miss it in some ways, but in many others it can just go get bent.

Here's to a new horizon and a new future. I will write my own destiny!  




 I know! It's the N on that part number. Who uses a reman Bosch when you can get a new at the same price...(and better warranty) 




 Go away, or I shall taunt you a second time! 




 Email the company and they will tell you local suppliers or if you are lucky, send you samples. 




 OP and everyone else who has a tough time reading. Send me a PM with your email address and I will send you a copy of my latest book n/c. It's a light read, fast paced, and only about 4 hours to finish.

I can't make your desire to read become strong again, but perhaps I can give you something to start you on the path. 




 I'm...BATICE! 

No...that's not right, I need to just...chill...
 




 When it comes to your power supply, you can't go wrong with a bigger one. 

If you want to add something later, best to have the extra power now instead of having to just upgrade it later on. 




 *Deleted 




 Would you need more? Or less? 

Now that is the question.

If you have no need for $500 most will assume you are rich already. Or, you are so far in debt, that $500 isn't splash in the pan.  




 There are tons more to go though. His writing is a style all of it's own. 




 How about a guy reaching through a mirror as if the surface was just like the top of a calm lake... 




 If it can grow lettuce, it can grow...


Carrots! 




 Not the one I was thinking of, but looks interesting enough to check out on its own. Thank you. 




 Ahh! You nailed it! It was the mountain that was throwing me off. Thank you!  




 It was a long time ago and I only remember a few things...

-It was about 2 guys who tried to climb a mountain? (I think)

- I think one of them died while climbing and the other went into depression.

-He ended up living in an old train car at a ski hill?

-There was of course a woman mixed in here.

-I believe in the end he decided to climb the mountain in honor of his friend. (Not sure)

Sorry it's not much. What I can say so far is that it's not K2, but is from around that era. I have googled extensively, but have come up empty...

Maybe the Reddit hive mind will have better luck?

Thanks in advance!
 














 I have always wanted to build a 4x mustang. I was thinking an AMC awd drive train with a 89 Ish body. Not as tall as the one in the picture. 

The L6 would be awesome for low end torque too. 




 Keep writing, it will come. 




 Better than them lying to you and getting ripped to shreds on reviews. 




 Meow that's just silly. 




 Don't even worry about it. As long as you have the paperwork down for the American side...(IRS has no sense of humor btw, don't EVEN try to crack a joke with them)(Seriously) you will be just fine. 

If you happen to strike it rich, remember the little guy, aka - me and when it comes time to file your taxes, talk to an agent at H+R block or come back to me for more information.  




 First- How much are you earning? When I last did my taxes my agent told me I wasn't earning enough from writing to bother claiming the income yet. 









 Jim's Mortuary, you bag em we tag em. 

Or

I answer in another language, basically asking if they speak that language. Works great for telemarketers.  




 Depends on which of my stories you are looking at. Some are strong and independent. Others, are followers. Even others are mixing shades of either. 

Just like real women, in the real world.  




 I have a CD from a band called Gnoma. As far as I know it's the only one in existence. Heck, if you Google them, you get nothing. Nothing. Has a rock on the cover, but it wasn't punk...much. 




 It's only one book but try The Event 

http://www.amazon.com/Event-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B007JVCU3S/ref=sr_1_13?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1403836530 sr=1-13 keywords=jamie+heppner

Price was just lowered to. 




 I can tell you how to make 37k selling books. Just buy all my books first and I will tell you. 




 Perhaps the intro seems a touch dark, but I can assure you the story is pretty up beat. If you do take a chance on it, I would love your thoughts when you are done.
 









 Give this one a try maybe? 

http://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Thief-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B00FFRD672/ref=la_B006N2IJU2_1_8?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1403528597 sr=1-8


 




 I already write stories for my kids, would love to see one come to life in an actual book one day... 




 Upvote for the panda. ;)  




 I took a quick look and noticed a few things.

These have just been re-published, what were the old covers like?

You decided to comment on reviews, even as going as far as calling a reader the grammar police...how is that not biting you in the backside?

I wanted to hate you, but I can't. If you really are making the money you say, it's a jealous problem on my end. I like your latest covers. Simple but nice. Not my tastes, but then again that's why they are my tastes.

It's nice to know a fellow Canadian, and neighbour, can do so well as an indie.

Edit- Sorry are those your books or someone else's? Unclear... 




 Interesting...how about showing me some of yours? 




 You are welcome to take a look. 

Here they are.

http://www.amazon.com/Jamie-Heppner/e/B006N2IJU2/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1388676465 sr=1-2-ent
 




 I have been published for over 3 years. At best I see $100 a month with 3 titles under my belt. Normally, I see around $10-15 a month. Don't expect to get rich unless you are already famous. 




 Sadly transmissions are a big job, I know, just dumped mine. I can't help because of distance, but it might be better to look for a new-other vehicle. Good luck either way! 




 Would you be more interested in the paperbacks or is an e-reader better for you?

And thank you. Every bit helps.  




 Thank you. 

I have been on a long link of bad lately. Even snapped at a friend because she had a run of good luck.

This too shall pass, just a touch of help wouldn't hurt.

 




 If you got this far, thank you again for looking. 

http://www.amazon.com/Jamie-Heppner/e/B006N2IJU2/ref=la_B006N2IJU2_pg_1?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_82%3AB006N2IJU2 ie=UTF8 qid=1402419793 




 Punched a hole through my transmission last week. So far I am looking at over 2k to have it fixed. Both my kids inherited my wife's jaw problems, we have decided to fix it now while they are young, than wait till they are teens and spend 10x as much. My work, same job for over 20 years, was just hit with a major loss as our CEO and friend passed away. This has shaken the company pretty hard. 

Yep, what's next? I ask myself that too.

So off the top I want you to know, I am not looking for money, at least not directly. I have no problem with earning my money. 
I work hard, but it's tough, you all know it's tough. So I am asking for a trade.

I write books. And I have them available in e-book and paperback. I am hoping that even a few of you might be interested in what I write. It's not a perfect solution, but every sale I make helps out in the future. 

I have seen the power of Reddit do awesome things.

Thanks for your time, and the link to my work will be in the comments. 




 Untitled, original project. 




 Just did this in Canada, can confirm it works. Thanks! 




 No disrespect taken! 

After all, I am in the public eye. If I can't take a touch of critisism, well...I best exit stage left. And I agree with what you said. Honestly I typed this up in a rush at about 2 minutes before my head hit the pillow last night. If you are up to a re-read, here is the actual bite from the back of the book. I wouldn't mind hearing your take on it. 


His parents ignore him.

His motorcycle is trashed from the accident.

He has nowhere to sleep, no money left, and no job to earn more.

With few options open to him, Dario's future is dark, and depression is sneaking around the frame of his world. That is until his fingers push through the boundary of the reflection in front of him, and he learns that he can move through a world that others can only see.

Now...can he use this to fix the errors of his past, or will crime be the only option? 




 Some one needs to buy one of these so we can see what is really on it... 




 Dario woke in a hospital bed. His bike ruined, his family dismissive, and his job now gone. His stay in the hospital now just one more trouble on an already long list. That is until he finds out he can now enter the worlds inside of a mirror. Will this be an escape from the troubles that haunt him or just another thorn in his side?


Thank you for taking a look at my work. Please note that it is going on sale as of tomorrow (June 2nd) and will be on sale for three days. Hope you like it!  














 You will find a group of helpful caring individuals. Unlike most of reddit. The few who raise voices of disdain are usually silenced quickly by the mods. It's a great place to stretch your creativity.  




  Nice! I like the elephant. Looks awesome. Ever try your hand in /redditgetsdrawn ? 




 Any chance you want to link the art?  




 You have really tiny hands. 




 Or you can kill him the first time you see him and not fight him at all at the ballistas.  




 So...US only?  




 If you don't build a man cave - game room around this, I will be very disappointed in you. 




 Well, it's free, and linked to goodreads...not a retailer. I can see how it would be considered promotion, while at the same time, it's not. But gotcha. Thanks anyway?! 









 In Soviet Russia...No! Too busy! You go now. 




 Dry ice. But I didn't really 'find' it. 

 




 Bonus points if you own a purple pinto running on petrol. 




 Mirror Thief is an alternate take on a reality we all take for granted.

It's just a reflection to you, but to him it's a second reality. 




 Music sooths even the most savage of beasts. 




 Future Jumper Series on Amazon might be to your tastes.  




 It's the silence inside the mirror that speaks the loudest.  









 Looks interesting, but I think the ties end quickly.  




 It's just a reflection. Until Dario's fingers pushed through the boundary and a world of possibilies opened before him. 




 Nothing wrong with R.R. Martin, but know his story isn't finished, and he really leaves you hanging.

Course you do have 4 huge books to work through... 




 I burned up a good 5 minutes on a torch showing this to another player. Felt great when they finally got it. 









 301 now... 














 Just lags out. So... I'll take a copy for PC please. :-)  




 Unless you point something out we all missed. You are looking at a picture of the beach. Self explanatory. 




 The problem of having a fully geared player atfack you at SL 10, is gone. There are new problems now. You will still have plenty of fun though. Enjoy! 




 I'm still waiting on that last panel myself.... 




 For an indie author try the Future Jumper Series, by Jamie Heppner.

http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Unbound-Future-Jumper-books-ebook/dp/B00HUHM2WK/ref=la_B006N2IJU2_1_13?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1398911323 sr=1-13 




 Mirror Thief by Jamie Heppner...of course in this case, reflective might be skewed...

:-)  




 Up vote for Sauce! 




 I have a few out actually...

Here is a link if you are truly interested. 

http://www.amazon.com/Jamie-Heppner/e/B006N2IJU2/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1398263093 sr=1-2-ent 




 I typed out a longer description. Bit more detail. I don't want to name the particular person because it would make me as bad as they are.  




 You got it. See above please. 
























 Or more than likely she is actually a guy and you have gotten to close to make the game fun anymore.

Meet people in real time, face to face, and save yourself the hassle and the BS of online crap. 

(From a guy who went through it all, for a long time.) 









 PVP Canada, West coast preferred.  




 Thanks :) 

I am thinking that I will, after all I have 7 days to die...
 




 I am thinking it would work well...this is just the beginning of Day 1...perhaps I will see how the first day goes. 




 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YOdkjjXpnXxhZKRZo8w533CUx_PJXpHF0m1OOW3vo5M/edit?usp=sharing 




 New to this sub. So this is great advice. Now, just to find a private server... 




 Last straw was tonight when they were shooting me through the rocks, underground...

There goes all my gear. Again.

Want to keep playing, but can't play like this. 




 And the world cared not for the troubles of man, until it chose to cry along side them. 

Rest it peace.  




 If it's applicable...yes. 




 Dozen? Try thousands...easy. 




 Yes... I am! 




 No, that's why I said PM...but it's no secret who I really am.  




 I write e-books, send me a PM and I'll give you my works to add on to it for free for him.  




 The Event by Jamie Heppner, post apocalyptic with a twist. Good vs Evil where the Evil is a teenage boy with almost unlimited power and the good is his twin sister that he has tormented his entire life.  




 I have been writing for over 8 years, even with only a few readers some reviews trickle in now and again.

And the free promos help too. 




 I write awesome books that get great reviews, but almost no-one reads them... 




 Also mentioned two phones...since you forgot. 




 It basically means there is an unpaid bill tied together with ownership of the car. So if a person were to buy that vehicle, they are now responsable for the bill as well. 

The car could be taken to sell at no notice by the person holding the lien to pay off the debt owing.

Generally, it's a great way to say, don't buy this. 




 The Event, by Jamie Heppner

What happens if the hero doesn't make it out alive? 

(Would be rated R if it were a movie too) 




 Future Jumper series, Sci fi and looping time travel. 




 Paint it to look like a PS4 and show it to Reddit...swim in all those glorious Internet karma points.  




 Get on fiver.com ASAP 

It might help you right away with a few gigs. 

If you have any experience with digital book covers, send me a PM. 




 She should be photoshopped into different events not giving a fuck. 




 It's pushed in, actually drove in, still holds air too. 









 The Event, by Jamie Heppner. Lots action and twists you won't see coming! 




 So...salt in the gas tank really can stop a car from running! 




 Hit enter twice to break paragraphs up. 

Hold shift to turn i  into I. 

 




 You might be shocked how well things like that can do. Truth is stranger than fiction. 




 Mirror Thief by Jamie Heppner. Free till the end of today. 5/5 stars on paperback version. 




 Trying to convince people to read your work is very hard, free helps, but it's not an answer. 

Even now I have a free work available and it's barely being touched. 

Better in the long run to have some loss now to gain readers later. 




 Same here...sounds like we need to swap stories. 

Makes for some interesting reading, or nightmares... 




 Just need the right motivation. I didn't know I could write a book until I tried. 

Was scary the first time I had a stranger read it though...family will always tell you that it's good. Strangers don't have to worry about telling the truth.  




 Awesome, thanks for taking my offer. 




 Enjoy! 




 Nope, can't say I know her... 




 If you decide to grab a copy, I would love your take on it :) 
 




 Don't know the rules in this sub, but here is to breaking the rules on Christmas eve!

After a tragic accident leaving Dario with nothing he finds himself with a strange ability to enter the world inside a mirror. 

Now he must decide if this is a gift, or a curse set to ruin what little life he has left. 




 First book took 2 years. Next two were faster. 

This is my third one, Mirror Thief. I like it the most, but it's the shortest of the three. Good read if you are interested. 5/5 Stars so far... 




 Explain, perhaps I can help? 














 Lighting my couch on fire...hard to sit through a movie that way. 




 [Mirror Thief](http://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Thief-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B00FFRD672/ref=la_B006N2IJU2_1_8?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1419347097 sr=1-8) Might be what you are after, and if you can hold off till the 24th the author has it going up for free for Christmas. 




 [The Event](http://www.amazon.com/Event-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B007JVCU3S/ref=asap_B006N2IJU2?ie=UTF8) Author has a freebie coming up tomorrow if you want a look at his other work.

This one though has been often looked at as dystopian, yet I think it's more post apocalyptic fantasy.  




 Many people have already posted that this is obviously not a tracing. Nice work.  




 I will tell her you think so.  :) 
 




 Or, how about this...

My niece drew a piece for my nephew, she showed me a picture and I though...hey that's cool! 

I posted it here. 

People actually liked it.

And the conspiracy theorists climbed out of the woodworks and made way more out of a little picture than was actually there? 




 The link to original artist has already been provided, but should you miss it, here it is again. Sorry I didn't have it at first, honestly didn't know this was already done.

Here is the Facebook of the artist of the original photo. 

https://m.facebook.com/Pertheseus
 




 On mobile is a short form for...have my cell in my hand, heading out the door to work and can't add it this second. Now I am at work, pulled up a tab and am going to edit it.  :)  




 Didn't know this was already done, and very happy to credit original artist. Thank you all for supplying the links. I will add it to my post as soon as I am off mobile. 




 Actually I was a fucked sleep. Is it a copy of someone else's work? Cool! They had a great idea.  




 Actually, she took the picture. 

But yes, stick men and I get along very well. 
 




 I will have to see if she is willing to release a copy right for you. ;)  




 F
 




 I wish I could take some credit. She's amazing, am hoping to twist her arm into making some book covers for me. 




 She made this on a whim for her brother. He's on a bit of a Zelda kick these days.  









 In the infancy of the internet I thought I had fallen in love. It turned out to be a joke played on me by a woman that had her own heart broken by another. She couldn't hurt him, so she decided to hurt someone else the same way she had been hurt.

I learned from that mistake myself and have regularly found others falling for similar traps, and sometimes helped them see it for themselves. Other times, I am happy to say, it wasn't fake.

I have even thought I should be writing a book about it. At least my experiences anyway.  









 [The Event](http://www.amazon.com/Event-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B007JVCU3S/ref=asap_B006N2IJU2?ie=UTF8)

Good vs Evil in a post apocalyptic world. Throw in Zombies, Werewolves, and a shutdown of almost all technology to make a story unlike anything you have ever read. 




 Wait for Brandon to release the next one? 




 A Collection of Shorts by J Heppner. Has a taste of everything and it's free.  




 The title escapes me right now, but look up a book by Branli  Caidryn. .. 




 Funny, I couldn't give a shit if it says "by" or not. If that is what it takes for you to not read a book, you need to look inward first.
 




 No. I'm sorry, whatever that was that I just read, you need to take it down now. And this is coming from someone who published too early as well. Trust us, take it down and work on it before you try again.  




 [The Event](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B007JVCU3S/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1418263750 sr=8-1) Zombies, death, apocalypse, good vs  evil in the former of twins...if this book was a movie it would be rated R... 




 Hey! Thanks! That looks awesome.  









 Hard to type with an accent that makes it sound the way it should :) 
 




 Piston broke. 




 Amazon ranks free books different than paid. You might even hit #1 in your promo (I have at least twice) but the minute it's over your title drops off the face of the internet.

Even price structure changes where you sit in rank catagories. 

Amazon isn't willing to help indies any more than a big traditional publisher. The best way to get your work in front of people is to write the next book. Then, the next one...and one more after that. 









 Nope. Every one of my books starts with a few characters,  a situation, a problem, and then I just write down what they do to fix it. If I feel it starts to drop off I add some excitement out of their control and watch what they do. 




 Miracles if you are bad. Not much if you are good.  




 I know long term parts experts in Ford and Dodge. I will show them both tomorrow and maybe get a hit for you. Worth a shot. 




 I see that price on PC...I would grab it, see what happens! 




 I am guessing yes. Since there is no way to stop the smoke from drifting back in. It might not be as strong, but it will still be there. 




 Yes. Both links are coming up at 29.99 for me. Hence, do you have "Another" link? 
 




 I remember making my Mom laugh so much she would cry. I wanted to do that all the time for her. It was nice to see her happy. I don't get to see that often these days. 
 




 Can't see it at 9.99 anywhere. Do you have a link? 
 




 This is something no-one can answer for you. For every person out there the experience is going to be different. For me, it was a comfort, but she sat (sits) in a chair most of the day and complains that no-one will visit her. 

For my wife, it was a childhood of belittlement and trauma that she is still working to get over even at 30 years old. 

Some will say you were blessed with this, others say how sorry they feel for you.

All I can say is, when you get the chance to be a parent yourself, just be there for your kids. It's more important than any of the toys or privileges out there. 




 [The Event](http://www.amazon.com/Event-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B007JVCU3S/ref=asap_B006N2IJU2_1_4?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1417544575 sr=1-4)

On mobile, so hopefully the link works properly. 




 "The Event" is told from a post apocalyptic view, where electricity as we know it no longer works. However, it does not follow the lines of reality very closely. 

Also be warned, if this were a movie, it would have an R rating. Turns out teenage boys with no rules and almost unlimited power really know how to get into trouble.  




 It doesn't matter where they are now. As long as you are there, a piece of them remains.

 




 [The Event.](http://www.amazon.com/Jamie-Heppner/e/B006N2IJU2/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1417360029 sr=8-1) 

A lot of action scenes broken up in great segments. 
 




 If you could also make it rain, they would be 10x more effective! 









 OC? Really? Right off the front page? 




 Black Tusk?  




 I noticed that, in low lighting it's worse. Very observant of you. 
 




 Very true, but imagine the PC you could get. Course, after all those driveways...my hands wouldn't work well enough to move the mouse.  




 I should move to Boston...20 bucks times...1000 driveways...HELLO NEW PC!  




 Friend is 1.5 hours away. I have some old boards but they are really old. Usually I just save them for spare parts for friends, or build a basic surfing PC and give em away.

Pretty low on power supplies though. I will have to start digging around in re-use-it centers again. 




 Heh! That's awesome! How did you know that's what I was posting with? (Dug out my old laptop, just couldn't do that small thing anymore.)
 




 $ is always an issue. Timing could have been better that's for sure. I will have to see what I can afford. 




 I liked this machine. My wife's is my old machine, going on 6 years at least...won't die. Not sure what to do yet on a new one, but I do need one. Mobile posting just isn't the same. 




 Looks like it. Power to everything. But nothing kicks up. Complete failure. 

Talked to a tech buddy and he thinks it's the same thing. Absolutely nothing comes up on boot. Not even an error.  




 It was fast at least. 




 It will take time. Not sure...Thank you. 




 It was quick. It was painless. Last night, it coughed. I was playing Dragon age, and loads were slow. I thought...I should update my drivers tomorrow, just in case. This morning...the motherboard...I...it...

Still too painful. I'm sorry.

And moble typing...it hurts. 









 Get a friend to put booster cables on it for half hour with their car running. That will trickle charge your battery. If/when it starts take the cables off and disconnect the positive cable from your battery. Car runs? Your alternator is good. Car dies? Your at is toast. 

Just about as basic a test as you can get.  









 XCOM
I have to load that one up all the time. Blowing up aliens is just a blast.  




 Perhaps look at this one. 

Dragon Age: Inquisition 

It's real time, but you can pause for strategic players. I am REALLY looking forward to it next month.  




 While not a turn based game, I found what I had been missing (and I think you too) when I started playing the Demon Souls/Dark Souls games. They are real time, but the...hard play style brought back the fun. 

Now, if that isn't your taste, there are still turn based games out there in RPG format.

XCOM for instance. Not a classic RPG but still a hell of a game, in all its forms. 

And for the life of me, I remember seeing a new game coming out very soon that is all turn based combat in an RPG form, but the name has left me! 

I am sure another Redditor will remember it and add it here...or I will in an edit once I can stimulate my fogged brain.  




 Well they are normally more rugged. Odds are she doesn't have it hooked up right and it's timing out. (Wrong input perhaps) That would make it seem like it's just going black. 




 Phone the authorities. 

It doesn't matter if he knows who it would be. It's better to do it while someone is still alive.

And better to not wait. Now is a good time. 
 
























 I am still torn as well. Thanks for the input though!  




 As promised here is the link.

Honesty is best, please, what do these say to you?  




 I am in the process of revamping my book covers, and I asked before for a "no holds bared" opinion on the covers I had put forward. Your input was invaluable, so I am hoping that here, in round 2, you can all assist me again. Link is in comments so as to not be considered advertising. The book title is common enough that you would have to dig if you wanted to find it at this point.  




 I would love to be included in this. Even if I don't win, it would  be really cool to see it happen for someone. 




 Limiting yourself by age seems like a major mistake to me. Unless your intent is something other than a partner.

I don't fit in your criteria, however I am always looking for artists to help express what I can create with words. 

I can't offer you much help, but perhaps there is someone out there that can. 

Good luck!  




 Hang out in r/writingprompts for a while and try your hand a few. That might help. 

On the other side though, careful what you start. As an author, I have too many ideas. It's now a serious lack of time that gets in my way...

And Reddit...that too.  









 Count me in, real name and all!  




 The Event by Jamie Heppner.


It's an apocalyptic sci fi fantasy that never gets a dull moment without something happening. 

And, it was written by a Gamer (odds are like your husband) that just got tired of playing the games.  




 I started writing an independant story in the 7D world, but it never really hit home with anyone so I dropped it. Perhaps if there were more interest I would start again. 




 you missed some 0's I think.  




 I am at 38...so maybe what, .06c earned? 




 All of my stuff is on Amazon :) 


*Edit* Link for the interested, might as well since Reddit is so up in arms over pretty much everything these days. Here is my stick to add to the fire. 

**edit 2** Robot won't let me link so, use your mind! ! !

 Me!

But my definition of near and yours may be completely different... 




 Sorry, but I am confused? You are saying don't do anything with it? Meaning,  you like it and don't think it should change? 

(I like Buffy, but Angel was really the only good spinoff IMHO)  




 Gotcha...Carefull, may be a best seller out there entitled MOON! one day. 

I know this needs work, I just need to find what I am really going for, that hasn't already been done 1000 times. 
 




 You are right with it being tied in and yes, it is broken, even more than in that image. Perhaps I could tone down the people, and bring a more shattered moon as a complete background image?  




 That actually made me LOL, MOOON! 
Maybe that's why I should have tied into it more, or even just change the title to MOON! 

However, this story has been around since before Twilight, and the moon is tied in, hence the show. Is it vital on the cover? Nope.

I am more interested in what you are trying to say with Show, don't tell. When as a cover, it's all show? That's where I am running into problems, how can I use a cover to say the words I want said. With no words. Perhaps I should turn the world on it's heels and put my synopsis on the front and back, with only a faded image in the background... 




 27b/6 is awesome! 

I came here for honesty. I would rather have it. 

I am thinking of tossing the background almost completely. The moon, does have significance... 




 Thank you. I have my doubts and they are being realized. I have showed others, but since they know me I am getting nothing but "Awesome! Great! Perfect!"

I know better and Reddit loves to be brutally honest with people. That's why I am here.  




 Thanks! That's a great help!  




 Thank you. There is a "too digital" quality that I am not a fan of.  




 You would be surprised what counts as advertising here on reddit. I will post it here in the comments hoping it doesn't get me blocked. 

"Can evil be defeated, or does it merely transform?


Donovan is evil.


He knows it.


He doesn't care.

When an unprecedented solar flare ruins the earth, it changes all humanity, turns back the clock to days long gone, and gives Donovan the power to do almost anything he wants.

That is, as long as he can get rid of his sister.

After all, she has the same power he does.

 




 Hey, I said no holds barred and I meant it. 

If I tell people about it, the author, or anything other than a picture. I am advertising. If I could have removed the title. I would have done that too. 

Thanks for the input regardless.  




 As mentioned, here is the imgur link.

 I have a large part of the work already done, but I am looking for a way to place the glass inserts without large bulky tabs underneath. 

I think that ideally I should have cut a small bevel around that the glass could have fit in, but my tools are limited (almost everything so far is done by hand) and I am so close to getting finished that I am doing my best not to rush. I will place a few photos in the comments to show the general outlay. 

TL:DR Glass needs to go in, how can I hold it without making it look like crap? 









 Look at the date of the original post. Not this persons post.

This is posted on the bottom.

"Note: The San Jose Police Department confirmed the break-in occurred on October 29, 2014, and provided me with a case number. Roohparvar has also provided the following image of his busted-in office door."

 




 Anyone else notice the original article is already a year old?  




 Maybe take a look at [Mirror Thief](http://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Thief-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B00FFRD672) It's on the smaller side, but still getting 5 Stars. 









 Nice pun.  Yes, I am thinking it was a bad start, but the feeling is there, why should I give them a second chance when the first left a "rotten egg" taste in my mouth. 




 That is the kind of experience I would have liked to have. Sadly, I don't see it happening. I tried customer service but just got the same answer over and over. I don't think it's worth a second try. 




 It would have been if they had actually shipped the product. They are just charging me (potentially) and not shipping anything. 

If the product had actually left, I would understand delays out of their hands. However, they just said they might be billing me, but aren't shipping anything. 




 I live a little out of the way, so normal shipping is two weeks. They promised to have it in 2 days, 3-4 would have been expected, so now I am sitting for anywhere from 8-10 days at the best. Odds are, I will have another bill pop up long before I get this card and I will have to start saving all over again now.  




 That's the problem, now I sit on my chair and wait. Or I take a chance and only create more problems in the long run. All because NewEgg can't figure out what they are doing. 




 I am no stranger to online shopping. This however is a first, if my address contained a "C" but I typed it as a "c" they would cancel my order. 

I checked, it was the exact same address as I have been using for 3 years. That's just their excuse for a cancellation.  




 Odd, my money may be disappearing, but no cool stuff will be appearing. 
 




 I just ordered my GTX970 (finally saved enough money for it) and within 24h they cancelled my order. Claimed there was a problem with my shipping address. (Used it for 3 years, paypal and ebay confirmed) and that I may be charged the full amount from my bank regardless. But I shouldn't worry, the money will be refunded in up to 5 business days. So they say. 

SO! Now I can't even buy another card since I have to wait a full 5 days to make sure the bank doesn't withdraw the funds for a card I am not going to get and put me in an overdrawn state.

I just beat my head against my firewall for 30 minutes with their customer support, but they just kept copy/pasting the same cookie cutter responses. I have had more intelligent conversations with a bot...

I am not too happy with NewEgg right now. To say the least.

So am I alone? Or has anyone else been treated like this from these guys.  




 Cept in this instance...

http://www.amazon.ca/Mirror-Thief-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B00FFRD672 




 You have 4 posts over the last 4 months and every one of them are you asking for help. The kindness of Reditors can be amazing, however perhaps you should be looking somewhere more local first.

Not saying you aren't legit, but? 




 So...I was just thinking... 




 I see you grabbed it. Thanks! Will let you know if I get more than a penny. 




 Nope. I can even show the bank deposit for it. Amazon loves to rape its authors.  




 Thanks! I don't see a lot of traffic so it would be a nice test of how much Amazon actually pays. I am not %100 sure, but I think the last one I was paid .01. 




 You got it!

There are other under the same name if you feel so inclined.  




 Caves, deep and usually under water.  




 Unless you are an administrator, you can't. If the message is blank it's an unfinished program, or a glitch.  




 It's the server sending you a message. For instance on one server I play in it tells you when you are within 1k of the boarder. 
 




 I ran...and ran, and ran. Still alive! 




 Have to keep looking, bigger towns are the best bet! 




 Was just on it  




 Follow a road, keep going, find a town. 




 Zombies spawn everywhere. Not just the city.

Dogs are still in game and just as strong. 

Yes, you have greater numbers but read that first line again. 

Logged in at night, in the desert, no town and was instant killed 3 times in a row.  




 Perhaps your humor is to deep for us. But, don't see it here. 




 I had a hand full of nails today after working on some home reno's and I was thinking...damn I need a nail gun. My wife just looks at me and shakes her head now.
 









 Google is great, experience is greater.  




 It looks good, but I am in Canada, so far all these sites are charging a small fortune to get anything past the ice wall...

 









 Do you have any samples of work you have done before?  




 Stand alone with great twists try The Event by Jamie Heppner. There is a sequel in the works but it doesn't need it to finish the story. 














 Actual speed. Even compaired it to a newbie char last night. My 180 char is way faster. 




 What is your current health at? That might be the difference, I am around 170 I think...I just took it for a level base but it may be more than that.  




 It's part of character development, and I actually like it. I understand that you can't have everything right off the bat. 

Things that are worked for are more valuable to me. 

However, I also understand that other people just like the down and dirty, so if I were that person I would just turn on debug mode, hit g and run till your heart is content.  




 Source would be me, at lvl 23, running very very well. :)  




 You do know that as you gain levels you get faster right? 




 If you haven't found a buyer yet, let me know.  




 I don't care how many other people are. I stand alone! 




 Just wait until she becomes a proffesional redhead...! 




 Does, for the love of god, type DOES! 




 Have you looked at fiver? With art/writing skills you might be able to make the money in a couple days, or sooner.  




 Just and idea, but you can grab a zip drive for around 10 bucks and use it as a HD, not a ton of room, but it's better than nothing?  




 Not much to go on, but here is the first description of Dario Fisher from Mirror Thief. 

"For the longest time I simply just stared at the reflection in the mirror. The lines were still there. The brown eyes still had the light inside of them, I could see the signs of healing, although it looked like hell, it must have been worse before. My hair had been cut, poorly, it wasn't a style I would have chosen myself, yet I guess it was better than what it could have been if left to grow out. My face showed only the slightest bit of a scruff growing in. I didn't normally let my beard grow out, but I could see the advantage of not having a close shave at this point of a healing process. I noted with some regret that my goatee had been trimmed off. Ah well, it would grow back if I let it."

He has just awoken inside a hospital after a motorcycle accident. White male about 18 years old. I would like to see what image this little bit brings to your mind... 




 I am sure that it's a glitch at this level. They are just a box after all, one would think that you should be able to open it, locked or not. Perhaps in 11 it will be one of the "many" bug fixes!  




 Not working for Audible,
Budding...sure, we can call it that.
Shame, but enjoy your months of questions anyway! :)  




 Sounds like an awesome guy, I'm sure that he is. You are very fortunate to remember at least that much, all I remember of mine was him being angry and telling us kids to be quiet. 









 InvalidCust actually... 




 There is a company that makes aftermarket heater setups for older vehicles that never came with any heat. It wasn't a factory fit, but it did supply heat from the coolant lines much like todays vehicles. I believe they used to be a couple hundred dollars. I don't have the places name handy, but I know a guy that will be at work tomorrow who does. Since you mentioned you are in Canada as well I can get the toll free number to his work for you, see if he can dig up a name from his old memory. 

PM me if you are interested in that road.  




 1:Do you read e-books? (if you ever find time after answering all these questions.)

2:Would you like one for free?

3: If you like it, would you publicly tell everyone how awesome it was?
 




 I was hoping for some input on the logistics/plausability. I will wait and see.  









 Okay. Prove it. Prove you don't cheat. What server were you on, and who was the admin? I will personally ask them.  




 Oh well  then since no one lies on the internet, you should just message the mod and explain it was all an accident. 

I am a mod and I spend 2+ hours a night cleaning up after people that "weren't cheating".  




 Sure. DON'T FUCKING CHEAT!

And your steam ID gets banned. Not your game. 

If you want to dupe, go play offline. Some people actually want to play without cheaters messing things up for them.

 




 If it makes you feel better, I'm sitting here thinking...damn missed opportunity. 




 Had you hoped for a secret message and we're vastly disappointed to not find one? 




 Many places already have stopped doing DLST. If I had a vote, I would abolish it as well. Stupid thing, who thinks you can cut a foot off the top of a blanket, sew it on the bottom, and have a longer blanket?  




 WTF! Screw looking at the paper, run for the hills and get the hell away from that toilet!  




 No, just messing around for now. Not many readers around for this game yet. 

Maybe TFP are looking for a writer though? 

That would be cool! 




 Thanks :) I plan on it. I am enjoying the different writing for now.  




 Define "wonkey"? 

Not really sure what you mean here. There are worlds, they are generated...what else did you need?  




 The Event by Jamie Heppner

Dark post apocalyptic good vs evil where good is questionable...
 




 Please remember, this is just raw writing I am doing in my spare time. Errors will and do exist, and feel free to point them out, but I am spending no extra time editing this stuff. It's just for fun!  









 Rainmeter. 




 And I now see you are OP, so do you know the wattage of what you purchased?  




 Very true. But a 1500w space heater needs at least a 1500w inverter (I won't get into spike wattage detail, but a 2000w inverter would be even better.) so the odds of OP buying that large an inverter is slim on a limited budget.   




 Sadly an inverter won't power a heater very well, if at all. You are better off to run the car and use it's heaters that way. Even better to stock up on blankets and be sure to put some under you when you sleep as well. 

Hope you don't get too cold. 




 True. But they don't usually talk like  .... 




 Yes, you need to set up a blocking system. Or your server will be over run in no time.  




 Omw! I'm just north of you! 




 I am always open to input. Feel free to message me here, or find me on FB. My name is no secret here on Reddit. 




 If it makes you feel any better, I say down and just typed. There is no editing process involved in this at all.

Other than spell check, which has failed me before.

Thanks, I think I will see what the rest of the night brings me. 




 A hug. 




 I have an idea on how to incorporate some of those skills in a learning curve. Thanks for reading.  




 Rest of night and day 2 coming soon! 




 I already do. But having your work enjoyed by others makes it even more enjoyable to me. 




 Thanks :) I think I will more than likely write more.  




 hehe, we will see...I am having fun writing it so far. If there is support, I might continue.  




 Perhaps. 

What did it feel like when you held her hand?
Looked into her eyes as the lights in the cafe shifted shadows across her face?
When she stepped away from that first night as  you watched her sit down into a cab and close the door?


She isn't real on google.
