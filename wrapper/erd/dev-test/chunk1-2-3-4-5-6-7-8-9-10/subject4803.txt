 Point Loma Seafoods down at Point Loma is very similar to El Pescador in terms of what they offer, except it's a much larger fish market. Might want to check them out for possible oysters.

 You probably don't remember, but I stopped by to your booth at 2009 Comic-con. You guys were a couple hours late and hungover as hell. What happened to you guys the night before?? Haha 




 I believe that's Sutro Park? I loved walking around here because I grew up across the street from Safeway down by the beach. If you ever get the chance, keep walking up and to the left, there will be a parking lot, which leads into the ruins of Sutro Baths as well as Land's End, giving you one of the most unique views of the GG Bridge.

 [](/wtf) 




 Zito is slightly more bearable right now because he is on the DL (I guess that in itself says something), but when he is playing, it's every fifth game. I cringe every time I see Tejada, which is nearly every game, and starting for that matter! I forgot about Benitez, he was pretty bad.  




 Who else would like to see up here? I definitely cannot stand Tejada this year. I know it is way too early to DFA him and experts would bash this move as a bad way of running a franchise. But at what point would you think 'hmm, this guy's season isn't going to turn around'? He is bad on offense, bad on defense (he seems worse at short than 3B), and is a constant letdown with runners in scoring position. At $6 million for this one year, I would say he ranks as one of the worst in franchise history. Off the top of my head, the only other horrible signing I remember would be Alfonzo. Thoughts? Discuss.

 I remember playing Final Fantasy VII on PS but I could never finish the game because my parents were too cheap to buy me a memory card so I would have to start over or leave the game running every single time. True story.

 What time was this taken at? 









 I saw the same thing happen, except it was an average guy running full speed on the treadmill. It was very early in the morning so the gym was relatively empty. He slipped, and the treadmill shot him straight back, his towel flying into his face. Dazed and confused, he looked around to see if anyone saw. I did, but he didn't realize so he tried to get back on, without realizing that the treadmill was still on full speed. He slipped again, fell on his knees and got shit backwards into the stationary bikes. Probably one of the funniest things I've seen at the gym.   




 I thought he was more like "come at me bro!" 




 Isn't this Stephen Lang? 









 It's ok, LaRoche did the same thing to us. Then we became the world fucking champions so I like the trend where this is headed.

 Have you ever thought how similar cameras are to guns? Have you ever considered doing a YouTube short on using cameras as the guns? The way  it straps around your body and the different lenses as different length barrels and compacts as pistols. Using mirrors as shields. Probably not the most original idea, but would love what you guys could do with your creativity!

 Lemon zester 




 It's a neurological condition that affects sensory perception. Patients see things that are smaller or larger than they actually are, but realize that this can't be real. There are also temporal effects such a time slowing down. It usually occurs before they fall asleep or after they wake up.

 Nope, actually it was in an adolescent girl. Pretty rare syndrome that usually affects children, but they usually grow out of it.

 As a medical student and crossfitter, I have had the same issue while doing cleans so I completely understand your frustration and pain. I know I can probably pull more, but the pain limits the weight I carry as it hurts more with increased weight. I realized cleaning uses a lot of muscle groups including abduction and flexion of the shoulders. This creates a lot of strain on the supraspinatus muscles, which you can test with your arms pointed out at a 45 degree angle from the horizontal, thumbs pointed down, and ask someone to push your hands down while you push up against their hands. If that recreates the pain, you most likely have supraspinatus strain and/or some type of labrum tear. MRI or not, the first line of treatment is ibuprofen and rest and then physical therapy exercises to strengthen the accessory muscles. Surgery is last resort to reattach the torn labrum. For me, I get pain deep in the shoulder as well as some biceps tendon tenderness. I try to limit the weight and not go over 80% of my 1RM. I also noticed the faster you get your elbows under, the less weight strain on your shoulders so a lot is perfecting technique. Let me know if this helps!

 This makes a lot more sense. So, this means while he's swinging the light, his whole body has to be in constant motion? In a sense, he's swinging and dancing? Just trying to get a sense of how this looks lol. Thanks for the thorough explanation! 




 I'm still not sure why his body doesn't show up in the pictures. Is that light the sole light source for every picture? It looks unlikely especially in the one with the waves in the background.

 I'm moving to Las Vegas next week and I'm afraid there won't be any good coffee shops/roasters there. I've previously lived in very coffee-friendly cities, SF and LA, so I might be a little bit spoiled.
