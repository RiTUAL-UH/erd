 No, not at all! He's just a jokester 




 Thanks a lot! 









 Is there an official tier list? 




 Does anyone know how to make the score list that long? 




 You have your hobbies, and we have ours 




 Friday because everybody is lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend 




 Pokmon because I HAVE TO CATCH 'EM ALL 




 Off-topic, how did you get the score chart to show every score instead of just eight with a scroll bar? 




 It's all fun and games until a deer head falls on you. 




 Pichu and Daisy 




 Off topic, but what is that box with all of the civilizations' emblems at the bottom of the screen, and how do you enable it?

 Are the mega evolutions likely to be final smashes? 




 Do the 3ds pictures just look like this because it is supposed to be "3d" or will they actually have a different appearance than the wii u game?

 I think that's what it was in mk7 




 Oh that makes sense! 




 My Neopets are all basic, but what trade would I expect to get for a green Aisha named Vyfy? 




 What does that mean? 




 It seems odd that there are only 3 ATVs when there are so many karts and bikes. It also seems odd that there are so many lightweight characters. 




 OMG! 




 Haha, Jake didn't even hear that Carson asked him to introduce Tim McGraw. "Love you guys!"

 I am thinking about trading my 4L Pirate Krawk for a WN Woodland Xweetok. Is this a fair trade? 
























 Um, have you not seen the Spongebob Squarepants movie? 




 It's one of my favorites! 




 If you have a 3DS, get Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Your characters can visit each other and you can play mini games, watch stars, etc., and it's like you are on a real date! 




 You should post this to /r/wiiu and maybe /r/nintendo to get more responses 




 You're my new favorite person 




 People on /r/smashbros do, at least  




 Well, who doesn't do that?

 I like seeing fan art though. :( 




 Does this mean there can only be 8 players at once? 




 I honestly think that the characters who have been in only pictures or in videos for a split second (like Game and Watch) are going to be the "hidden" characters of the game. 




 Rhode Island? 




 Woooo! Happy birthday us! 




 Me! We all must unite! 




 Yeah! 




 Thanks! 




 The 30th! 




 General consensus seems to point to Fire Emblem as a first choice! And if I can get any more games, it looks like I should decide between Kid Icarus, Wonderful 101, and Donkey Kong. Thanks for the responses so far! 




 Is it easy to find online matches? 




 Okay, thanks! And I have a question on Kirby, did you think it was too easy of a game? I've read that in a few reviews 




 I'm definitely considering fire emblem now as it seems to be a well-liked game! And I love Animal Crossing as well! 




 Thanks! Is earthbound a virtual console game? 




 I'm going to get a few games for my birthday, but I am not sure which ones to ask for! I am considering the following:

Fire Emblem: Awakening

Kirby: Triple Deluxe

Mario Golf World Tour

Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze

Kid Icarus: Uprising

Wonderful 101
 




 Yeah it is probably a good way to measure intelligence within your own school, but who knows the different teaching styles and difficulty levels between schools? 




 I think you would have to be reasonably smart to get a 33. I don't think that just being able to find context clues constitutes getting almost every answer right. 




 It's okay, I appreciated your post 




 Ai-Ai!

 Thanks! 




 Does anyone know how to fix this? Peach literally jumps in the air and then floats back down without doing anything. 




 No presents?? Why? :( 




 You could just give them to me 




 You can do that? That seems unfair LOL! 




 If I reset my game to choose a different starter, can I get another shiny Beldum? Or could I just transfer it to Pokmon Bank and then onto my new game even if I delete my old save file? 




 Okay, I will preorder king DeDeDe, Ike, and probably Toon Link anyway. 




 Would it be a good idea to preorder some wave 3 amiibo online? 




 Oh I thought it was an online game or something and I thought there might not be many people online 




 That's what I was afraid of. 




 Is it still worth getting now? 




 YOU DONT GET IT 




 Well honestly I don't blame them if someone called them a geek. It hurts your feelings.  




 Thanks LOL 




 What is it like against all CPUs? 




 Is it worth it to get Smash U now if I have Smash 3D? I am definitely going to get Smash U, but I am wondering if I should just wait and ask for it for Christmas from my family.

 I am currently debating spending an extra $50.

 I mean, I'll take it if you don't want it. 




 So can you only play this when you streetpass someone? 




 What if I play on all three teams? 
























 Jigglypuff because it's my fave Pokemon! :o 




 But he is SO great we all have to vote for him anyway  




 That is the same thing I said in another thread! 




 I don't understand why everyone loves Sawyer. I mean, he could fart into the microphone and still win. -_-

 Four nickels? 




 I'll give you one nickel 




 This makes me sad :( 




 Nomiibo  




 Sonic!!! D: 




 Yeah I did, but I bet someone else would take up your offer! 




 Haha, okay! 




 I'm wondering if I should pick up this game. If the online part isn't as active anymore, should I still get it?  




 I was wondering which of these games would be the most fun for me. I really like animal crossing, which I know is often compared to these two. The reviews are also pretty good for both games. Which do you think is better, or are they different and both good to have? And how bad are the frame rate issues with story of seasons? 




 What about the tournament mode too?
