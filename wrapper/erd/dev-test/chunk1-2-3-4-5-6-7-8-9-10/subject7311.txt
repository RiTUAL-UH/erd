 How do you deal with different reactions (positive/negative) to your cosplays and other professional photo shoots that you do? (meaning underwear ect). I'm guessing most people/fans will be happy with your work but is it difficult at times when there are people simply "hating" or "trolling" on your page in an effort to put down the great work you do?

 Hey, so lately I've been watching a lot of **Miyazaki** films, such as **Spirited Away**, **Princess Mononoke** and **My Neighbour Totoro**. I've also watched **The Raid** and **Raid 2**, and I think they're pretty awesome. I was wanting to get more in to Asian cinema as a whole. 

I like a wide variety of movies, and have no idea where to start. Are there any **large blockbuster** asian movies I should check out? And any **small/independent** films worth watching too? 

If you could give **reasons** to watch these films too without spoilers then I would appreciate it greatly.

**Preferably** no horror suggestions, as I am a massive wimp, however I do hear that some great horror films have originally come out of Asia.  




 I personally hope he does, he was one of the only redeemable qualities of the prequels, and it would be interesting to see what obi-wan did between 3   4. Unless it's just adventures on Tatooine. 
























 Thanks, forgot about checking the Criterion! 




 Thanks, I used to watch death note when I was younger (15/16), and I don't mind gore, so I'll be sure to look up Living Hell and Battle Royale. 

I've never watched foreign comedies, does the humour translate well over subs? Or would it be best to search for a dubbed version? 
























 Thanks :) 




 I don't mind older films at all, so thank you!

I've seen Seven Samurai get mentioned a lot, so I think I'll definitely check that out first. 
























 Thanks for the list, saving them all to look up later :) 




 Thanks, just looked up Dragon Tiger Gate, looks interesting :D 
























 Well I'm glad to find someone that shares my enthusiasm! I'm really hoping this isn't a flop; it looks fun and isn't associated with a huge franchise like everything else nowadays!  




 I've really enjoyed the trailers but as far as I'm aware there's not a lot of buzz around this film.. 

Am I wrong? Are there people excited for this movie? Or does this film just look "meh" to others?

 Buried 

ET (I've never watched it.. Hence why I bought it on Blu-Ray) 

Road to Perdition 

The Worlds End

I think there are a couple more.. I buy cheap blurays from CEX that I want to watch, but sometimes I end up going back for more and other films just get left out along the way!  




 Land Before Time is one I battled over for my own list 




 I know what you mean, should've made it top 10 at least! 




 Seeing a lot if these going around lately and got curious! 

*Give Reasons?* It's fun to discuss!

**1.** The Lion King
**2.** Beauty and the Beast
**3.** Princess Mononoke
**4.** The Iron Giant
**5.** Toy Story 

The majority of this list is because I've been watching them since I was a small child. But as I've grown up I appreciate the deeper themes, especially in The Lion King and Toy Story. 

Princess Mononoke introduced me to Studio Ghibli at a later age, and I love the art, the action and the mythology!  




 1) Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back
2) The Lion King
3) Shawshank Redemption 
4) Pokemon The Movie: 2000
5) Django Unchained  




 Thanks, definitely using this chart! And will check out everything you suggested and your post :) 




 Thanks, looked them all up and they all seem really interesting so I'm adding them to my list :D 




 Thanks, I can tell I'll be on this all day ha!
