 Umm what was that?? 




 GRONK SMASH!!! 




 Its before the Pepsi halftime show  




 Who cares it's a year away 




 Maybe r/CFB should have its own super bowl game thread so that it not overcrowded and full of irrational discussions 




 Of course they do this after cutting multiple former AirTran routes  




 Well good luck man. You can message me if you get lonely   




 it helps for me that I go to a small school (like 2100) so its kinda hard to not make friends over time becauase you know everyone. We don't hang out that much, maybe once or twice a month, and most of my "social" activity is with my roommate (who I actually like which is good). The most activity that I do with my friends is have lunch. So I'm still kinda a "shut in" but I am more active now.  




 A Republican a hypocrite? NEVER 




 I'm shocked, SHOCKED. That Jeb Bush was ever a bully considering how nice he was to the Schiavo's 




 We may be amongst the last now, but when the supreme court rules we hopefully won't have a gay marriage ban. Think of it like the sodomy laws. Georgia's was overturned by the state supreme court about 6 years before the supreme court overturned it nationally (though the Georgia case didn't involve a gay couple). Even though we were amongst the last we weren't THE last.  




 I'm in my last semester. I didn't really start making until my 5th semester and now I have a small circle of friends.  




 good for him 




 Can I buy you a drink or do you just want the money? 




 Yes I am, Yes I am, Yes I am! 




 As a native Georgian I totally understand - I was pissed about Alabama, South Carolina, and Mississippi's laws being declared unconstitutional before us. I just want it to be legal here before the Supreme Court has the final word so that we can say that we weren't among the last  




 My Freshman year of college every Friday and Saturday evening I would order a pizza (or some other type of takeout food) and take my laptop into the study room in my dorm and just sit there and watch Netflix until about 2am while everyone else in the dorm was either hanging out or throwing parties. It was quite common for me to have to wear headphones just so I could hear because of all of the noise from people having fun. I would always make sure that my roommate was asleep before I went back into the room (he was a stoner and a party animal so this is why I didn't want to be in that room). The way that I would make sure that he was asleep is that I would go outside the building and look to see if the light was on in our room. Once it was out I would finally be able to go get some sleep. This went on my entire freshman year. 




 How about she loves me unconditionally. No matter what happens she is always there to cheer me up.  




 The organization I work for advocates fewer environmental regulations and is against a minimum wage increase  




 That shirts very becoming on you. Of course, if I were on you Id be coming too 




 because she is awesome!! 




 I though it said Prague at first

 Any other American breath a sign of relief once they realized that this was in Canada and not the US. (not to take away the awfulness of the case)

 My dad convinced me and my brother that the hazard lights button was a "hyper button" that would make the car go faster. When ever he pushed it he would slam on the gas to make us believe that it was the case. I quickly figured it out but my brother would go on believing this for years.  




 The families of the Chinese victims did. 
But some families were upset that the government decided on the fate of their loved ones without any concrete evidence.

In China, some family members refused to accept the official position that the plane was lost.
"They have found nothing," said Li Jingxin whose brother is missing.
"With nothing found, how can they make any announcement?''

Clearly they are so full of grief that they can't accept reality 
 




 Yeah it does seem a little excessive. The idea makes some practical sense but as always the implementation doesn't.  




 As a result of this coming out in the Israeli press the American Family Associations spokesman Bryan Fischer has been fired http://www.mediaite.com/tv/evangelist-bryan-fischer-has-been-fired-maddow-reports/ 




 That's why he was fired. The Israeli press found out about this group and asked why is a group whose spokesman, Bryan Fischer,says America a christian nation, founded for christians, and only christians are guaranteed first amendment rights is funding a trip to Israel (the JEWISH homeland) for a major political party. Needless to say once all of the past things that Bryan said were reported on it did not look good in Israel so they fired him. They didn't have a problem with him until now. So don't believe anything the American Family Association says about them not standing for what Bryan says. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow does a great breakdown of the whole affair http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/bryan-fischer-fired-ahead-of-rnc-israel-trip-390575171843 (the video in the link wouldn't work for me)  




 The video in the link wasn't working for me so I'll post the video from the MSNBC website [here](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/bryan-fischer-fired-ahead-of-rnc-israel-trip-390575171843), it is worth watching. 

TL;DR 

He wasn't fired because he was an anti-gay, racist, sexist, bigot. He was fired because the American Family Association is founding a trip to Israel for over 50 GOP members, including the party chair Reince Priebus. The Israeli press found out about this group and asked why is a group whose spokesman, Bryan Fischer, says America a christian nation, founded for christians, and only christians are guaranteed first amendment rights founding a trip to Israel (the JEWISH homeland) for a major political party. Needless to say once all of the past things that Bryan said were reported on it did not look good in Israel so they fired him. They didn't have a problem with him until now. So don't believe anything the American Family Association says about them not standing for what Bryan says.  




 The theory is that sense electric cars don't use gas they don't pay the gas tax, which funds roads. Therefore in a sense they are using the roads for "free" while everyone else is contributing to their upkeep through the gas tax. So you just charge them a straight up tax for having an electric car to make up for them not paying the gas tax.  




 Doesn't Putin want a bunch of far-right parties to be in power sense he is bankrolling most of them.  




 A little back story

Roy Moore is a big time Christian. Before he was on the Alabama Supreme Court he opened all his cases with a prayer. He called on Alabama to use it's powers to punish "homosexual behavior". He famously put a ten commandments statue in the Alabama Supreme Court building in 2002. He was taken to court by secular groups and they got a federal court to order it's removal. He refused and was subsequently removed from the court by a judicial oversight board. Alabamans reelected him to his former position in 2012 




 Georgia definitely needs to increase transportation funding and this seems like a good proposal, but I'm skeptical of anything that comes from the state GOP.  




 take $350 million from the highway fund over 2 1/2 years

So now their roads and schools will be shit

 Setting multiple alarms on my phone and placing the phone on the other side of the room. But to be honest what gets me out of bed most morning is having to pee.  




 As I told the other guy my position is that the money in politics - whether it's from the Kochs, Unions, Soros, Sheldon Adelson, McCutcheon, whoever - is DISGUSTING and TOXIC on our democracy and should be abolished.  




 Yes because conservatives don't have a hateful bone in their [body](http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/01/okla-career-anti-gay-lawmaker-introduces-3-bills-targeting-lgbt-community/) 




 Damn, Malaysia Airlines can't catch a break.  




 He deleted his account. You think we scared him off?  




 So you are comparing now to 100 years ago? Hmm where have I heard that [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV1VUS3Q2W0). So you want to cut programs that help people like Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and SNAP and prolong their struggle and let them decend into poverty? How nice of you. The only thing that needs to be cut is the DoD, and we need to raise taxes on the rich on close corporate and capital gains tax loopholes.  




 That makes no fucking sense. How has the "government expanding out of control" (ps it hasn't) led to a system favoring the wealthy. Large government means more protections for individuals - usually low income or middle class. Less government means less regulations which means more money to be made for corporations and their CEOs. AKA the Kochs  




 Oh you poor thing you're taxed to death! 
Seeing as you make only $30,000 a year (as you state in a post here:np.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/2mybbb/an_open_letter_to_reddit_liberals_from_a_reddit/) you already don't pay that much in taxes as you fall into a low tax bracket. I am advocating the abolition of super PACs and a limit on the amount of money you can give campaigns. What I would do first is say that money is not free speech, abolish super PACs, and say that corporations could not donate to candidates campaigns. People could still donate to political parties and candidates but it would only be $500 max. Then what I would do is close corporate tax loopholes and capital gains loopholes and use some (like maybe 6%) available for campaigns to dip into if they want, split evenly of course (by the way those taxes wouldn't affect you). 




 It's still $300 million less than the Kochs  




 My narrative is that the money in politics - whether it's from the Kochs, Unions, Soros, Sheldon Adelson, McCutcheon, whoever - is DISGUSTING and TOXIC on our democracy and should be abolished. I still fail to see how you can't agree with this.   




 Your link proves my point. Outside groups - Koch - spent more on elections than Obama did. The fact that billionaires are trying to buy our elections is disgusting and I don't know why anyone would support them. And I call it the Fox News strategy because they pioneered it. 




 Seeing how the average voter in this country is incredibly misinformed, if you see an ad repeating the same lie it becomes true over time. It's called the Fox News strategy   




 Of course he is a Republican  




 Of course a Republican  




 What world do you live in. This is NOT democracy. This is a few billionaires buying our elections. Left or Right it doesn't matter it should be illegal. This amount of money in elections is DISGUSTING. And by the way I missed the announcement, since when did greenpeace and unions have $900 million to spend on elections?  




  ~~Satan~~ Saban

Better yet why don't they ask the people that paid his mortgage 

 




 Money is NOT free speech. All is does is buy elections for the wealthy. This is a democracy not an oligarchy. And by the way unions don't spend as much as the Kochs and I don't think they should have the right to spend money on elections either.   




 you can thank the Supreme Court 
 




 What part of money in politics is toxic don't you understand  




 I think money in politics is toxic no matter the party. However I can't stand republicans acting like George Soros is on equal footing with the Kochs. The Kochs put Soros to shame with the amount of money they spend.  




 Do you honestly believe that?  




 Yeah close to that. They probably want to be like the NBA and NHL where  half the league goes to the playoffs.  




 While I agree with ESPN here that Jan 2 would make more sense for the semifinal games than NYE but they knew this would happen when they signed the contract. You can't sign a contract and then back out. And who knows maybe having the semifinal games on NYE will be a ratings bonanza. You don't know until you try.  




 Fuck the NFL. They don't need more playoff games.  




 That's my face when I'm on an airplane with a screaming kid.

 Ted hasn't owned the team for about 19 years. When he sold Turner Broadcasting to TimeWarner in 1996 they got the Braves as part of the deal. TimeWarner sold the Braves to Liberty Media, a holding company controlled by John C. Malone, in 2006/2007. The Braves signed a TV deal about 5/7 years back with FOX Sports South/SportSouth, two regional sports networks owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (formally News Corp). The deal was for 20 years and pays only $15 million a year. For comparison the San Diego Padres signed a contract 3 years later for $40 million a years and the Texas Rangers signed a contract 2 years later for $80 million a year. Logically if the Braves TV contract were on the open market today it could fetch somewhere between those numbers if not more. So yeah the Braves have a shitty TV contract that they are stuck with until the late 2020s.  




 the public transportation will still be shit though and traffic will be a NIGHTMARE as its right where 285 and 75 meet. 




 thats fucking wrong, it hurts business because they don't know if the government is going to shut down one day or if the debt ceiling will be raised because the GOP likes using our economy as a bargaining chip.

 Color me shocked that they actually apologized TWICE. The first apology seemed well thought out and articulate but the second one was clearly scripted and came off as fake - especially that smile at the end. Changes nothing about Fox though.  




 will they be in Baylor green?  




 You put way too much effort into this, you need to start lowering your expectations now.

Edited for grammar and spelling  




 of course it is /s  




 the thing is that with cable networks (which is probably what you watched 28 days later on) don't have any rules when it comes to nudity or swearing they do all of the censoring on their own voluntarily. Broadcast networks like ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox do however have rules regarding said stuff.  




 I don't believe anything that comes out of his mouth 




 Fox News rule no. 1 is to NEVER admit that you were wrong. There was the infamous incident when one of their anchors made the statement that "santa just is white". After a ton of backlash the next day she said that it was a joke (even though it clearly wasn't) and that people criticizing her were clearly liberals who were scared about how powerful Fox News is.

 I give a shit that the wins were restored because Penn St. is acting like they were the victims in this whole debacle, not the KIDS THAT WERE RAPED on their own campus. Is the NCAA a shit show? No doubt about it. But why should Penn St get special treatment after the fact when schools like USC and Miami were not. Especially sense the scandals at USC and Miami weren't nearly as bad as the Penn St scandal.  




 
What is most damning, for me, is that Paterno convinced Schultz, Spanier, and Curley to NOT go to police. After the other 3 resolved to go to Department of Welfare, Paterno convinced them NOT to do that. That is horrible.

"According to CNN in an email dated Feb. 26, 2001, Schultz wrote to Curley about a three-part plan that included talking "with the subject asap regarding the future appropriate use of the University facility,"  "contacting the chair of the charitable organization" and "contacting the Department of Welfare."
Former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley's alleged email could be damaging for Joe Paterno. (AP) It would have been better to skip directly to the third action and let the welfare authorities do the meeting and informing, but this should've been enough to end Sandusky's reign of terror. Except that Curley sent an email to Schultz and school president Graham Spanier on Feb. 27, 2001, that changed everything.
"After giving it more thought and talking it over with Joe yesterday, I am uncomfortable with what we agreed were the next steps. I am having trouble with going to everyone but the person involved. I would be more comfortable meeting with the person and tell them about the information we received and tell them we are aware of the first situation," Curley's email said

 too me it seems like people are jumping thru hopes to try and come up with a way to say that JoePa was innocent. If I were Joe I would have gone to the police once the administration did nothing or at the very least told Sandusky that I never wanted to see him around the campus facilities again 




 no he wasn't almost 60, he was 55. yeah JoePa wasn't close to retiring but he still could have kept coaching. JoePa told the administration what he had heard and once it became clear that the Penn St administration was covering CHILD MOLESTATION ON THEIR OWN FUCKING CAMPUS  up he should have gone to the police like and normal human being with a conscious .  




 what are you talking about, he's 70 now. he retired in 1999 at the age of 55. 




 It still doesn't change the fact that if Joe went to police that they would have taken him seriously. This man was a god in central PA, if he had evidence, even circumstantial or hearsay, the police would have done everything they could to investigate. The facts that that you site doesn't change the fact that Joe did nothing to stop what was happening and the Penn St. actively covered it up.  




 Ah another Paterno apologist. No he knew. Sandusky went from being coach in waiting to randomly retiring. The fact of the matter is that Penn St and Joe Paterno cared more about football than stopping a CHILD MOLESTER. 

 




 I was agreeing with you  




 Southerner here who's actually been to France. I would say that what most people here say is true. The NE is more densely populated and has better flight connections to Europe that the Southern, Midwestern, or Western part of the country. It also helps that NYC is a huge financial center and Washington is the political center of the country. Also like someone else said people out west may have a stronger connection to Asia and people in the southwest have a stronger connection to Latin America.  




 Cleveland might be NE politically or culturally but from a technical definition Ohio is part of the [midwest](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States) 




 Personally I would consider Ohio part of the Midwest  




 Gas taxes are used to fund infrastructure projects like roads   bridges. The federal gas tax hasn't been raised in 20 years and because of that funds are getting harder to come by. With the chances of a federal gas tax increase being almost 0, states are looking at the possibility of raising gas taxes on their own. The low price of gas at the moment makes it more palatable to raise the tax now than it was when oil was $100 a barrel.  




 I'd feel like I was selling my sole if I worked there 




 Well I checked the front page and second page and didn't see it there. I can't help it if 2 different websites have the same article and title.

 Fox never ~~learns~~ cares  




 Fellow American here and I totally agree with you. Before going to France  all I heard about were how rude the French were. I personally never experienced that. Granted the school group I was with stayed in more of the touristy areas so there were more english speakers (and one could argue that they were putting on happy faces for tourists). However there were a few times that we were not in tourist areas.  The locals may not have spoken much english but we made the effort to speak French when ordering something or asking questions which they seemed to appreciate.   




 Don't fell bad. It was bought by Rupert Murdoch the guy who owns Fox News.  




 I would have changed the headline to make it more clear but r/nottheonion is SUPER strict about changing titles

 I guess the rumors a month ago about a souring relationship between Whittingham and the AD were either false or resolved  




 Am I the only one here who think that this is wrong and that Penn St should not have the wins restored. I'm sick and tired of Penn St and Paterno fans acting like they were the victims here. The victims were the KIDS that Sandusky RAPED while Penn St turned a blind eye. Did the NCAA overstep? Possibly but guess what the NCAA makes up the rules as they go along. The NCAA is a dick to everyone (just look at USC) why should Penn St get special treatment when everyone else is punished to the fullest extent. 




 Did they learn nothing from Jurassic Park 




 My guess is something by either Fall Out Boy (again), Maroon 5, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, or Drake. Wild card would be Lady Gaga or Lorde (doubtful though)  




 never trust ANYTHING that the GOP puts forward as a plan/alternative  




 FUCK THESE ASSHOLES  




 Of course, introduce bills that have no chance of becoming law so that the GOP can focus all energy on that instead of things like tax and immigration reform

 It's weird seeing the US without sunglasses  




 excuse my ignorance but can you explain the poster in the background  




 I assume you mean insects not incest :) 

I think insects is self explanatory. I DON'T LIKE BUGS. Orcas..... I don't know why I don't like them. Maybe I'm just more of a fur guy and I have a hard time imagining them as anthros - same with birds probably. (though I did warm up to reptiles so who knows maybe I'll warm up to them as well)  




 Canines all the way. I'm just a dog person so I guess thats why I chose them (I have 2 fursonas a husky and a beagle). Others that I like are foxes, felines, otters, bears, and horses. Ones I don't really care for are birds, dolphins, pigs, insects, and orcas. I used to have a thing against dragons and reptiles but I'm slowly warming up to them.  




 I didn't know fish could be such dicks  




 My first year here as well. I really got into the game threads towards the end of the season and now it's like I can't watch a game without it. It makes watch football (especially bad football) more fun.

 I'm talking about the fact that they put it in the headline. It's fine if they mentioned his party affiliation in the article but no they had to mention he was a Democrat in the headline because they are Fox News. If the head line just said "Politician Wins Special Election From Jail" it would have accomplished the same effect of getting someone to click the article.  




 you mean geckos  




 What a bunch of cowards. Even USA Today, a newspaper that avoids controversy like the plague (seriously their editorial board leans loosely left but they let right wingers publish rebuttals all the time to give the appearance of impartiality) and the most vanilla newspaper I can think of, published the cartoons http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/01/12/hayat-boumeddiene-amedy-couilbaly-paris-terror-attacks/21621219/ 




 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/russia-is-not-charlie/514369.html 




 Of course Fox News needs to mention that it's a former Democrat.  




 I didn't say it was a bad thing. I'm using that as an example as to how USA Today avoids controversy.  I'm just saying that it's sad that the McPaper that is USA Today has more balls than Sky News

 You would miss Fox Sports 1   2, Pac 12 network, Big Ten network, CBS Sports Network. You would also miss any regional sports network in your area, going by your Umass flair you would miss NESN and CSN New England. Out of all of these the only networks listed here with "good" games would be FS1 and the Pac12 and B1G networks (which you already said you don't get). The RSN and CBSSN have some games but I think you can afford to not have them as it's usually lower tier games  




 let's be real if fox news was around at the time they would be defending the racists as trying to stop "traditional America" from being destroyed by the evil federal government and "activist judges"

 I'm very uneasy about this plan. Seems like it's giving the state and the governor too much power.  




 As I told the other person My comment wasn't directed at funding SC State. It was aimed at the fact that /u/SCRx seemed to imply that the state of SC struggles to fund all of it's public universities because of the fact that the state doesn't bring in much money from its low taxes. So I proposed the crazy idea of raising taxes to fund education in general, not SC State.

 Today 5 more counties started offering gay marriage licenses after not doing so yesterday. 

Also it sounds like the governor has a sound head on his shoulders (never thought I would say that of an Alabama politician). 
It is important for people across the country to know that the governor of Alabama today is not the governor of Alabama 50 years ago. 

**and**

I dont want Alabama to be seen as it was 50 years ago when a federal law was defied. Im not going to do that, Im trying to move this state forward.

Of note: It is the 50th anniversary of the March on Selma in about 3 weeks, I think this is fresh on his and other Alabamans minds right now.

 I didn't speak to him but a saw Jerry Springer a few rows ahead of me at a Cubs game. Same with Shaq saw him on the sidelines of the chick-fil-a bowl a few years back. I did however say hello once to congressman John Lewis of Atlanta once as I passed him in the airport.

 Also top voted comment on the article is as follows 


**Thomas:**
I walked into his chambers and could feel his steely eyes staring me down. His imposing figure loomed over me as I pressed my back against the wall. Roy dropped his judicial robes to the floor to reveal his well maintained body in all of its glory. His firm member showed a passion. It betrayed by his stone faced expression.
"I always wondered if you wore anything while you were on the bench..." I whispered.
"Shut up" Roy said as he advanced. He grabbed my shoulders forcefully and spun me around, bending me over his large mahogany desk. He drove himself into me from behind causing me to help slightly as I gripped the papers on his desk, moving them from the orderly piles there to be clenched in a fit of pain and passion.
"Oh, Roy!" I called out. "Shut up, Tommy" he insisted through gritted teeth.
Such was my first time.

**Response from Gary:** 
pervert

**Thomas reply:** 
Just when I thought my body could take no more, as I gasped and panted on the verge of collapse, Gary came in wearing a tight, wet T-shirt with a grin on his face.
"No, I can't..."I sputtered.
"You can." Roy said firmly.
"And you will." Gary said.
I lay back, ready to take whatever fate had brought me.
It was like kissing God.

**Gary again:** 
I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future.

**Thomas reply:**
"I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future." Gary said as he forced himself into my mouth. He arched his back as he did so before looking back down to me. "Now accept thy Lord..."
 




 this is fucking awesome  




 how do I do that?  




 You don't have to click the link, the headline is all you really need.  




 yes I know it's a christian site but I wanted to share the bigotry/crazy

edit: For those that don't want to give the site clicks the headline is all you really need, also he said this on his facebook page so this is not an "official" order yet. It should also be noted the the governor said yesterday that he would not seek charges against judges who issue marriage licenses to gay couples. So once again Moore is alone in this fight.

 Best quote from the article:
Asked if he believes a transgender woman is a woman, Artiles said, I am not going to get into that. I have not spent much time thinking about that.

So clearly, he is the foremost authority to author a bill specifically about that subject

 I live in the Atlanta area. Mom has no interest in her school's team (Clemson) and Dad is an extremely jaded UVA fan because of their struggles over the last 15 years so it was hard for me to be a fan of either of them because I was never exposed to them when I was young. So I just latched onto the two big schools here. 




 I know :D 




 I really like airports as well!! I like just exploring the place and just taking in the sheer size of the place. I also like watching planes move about and seeing the organized chaos of it all.  




 I hate beer and sweet tea. I can't stand coffee unless its loaded with cream, sweetener, or flavoring (or one of those pricey fancy Starbucks drinks). Also we recently got a Cookout and I don't see what all the hype is about, it tastes shitty to me (with exception to the milkshakes). And while I'm at it Chick-fil-A is just average fast food, people around here treat it like gospel

 I personally am not that much of a beer drinker - or really alcohol drinker to be honest - and have a negative opinion of alcohol in general because my mother is an alcoholic so I don't drink much of the stuff. Of course it helps I've never really found a "real" alcohol product that I liked (the only alcohol that I like are mixed drinks - daiquiris and the like - and Bailey's )  




 I'm still baffled that ALA-FUCKING-BAMA beat Georgia in getting gay marriage

 I haven't been to that many games involving my teams, the worst experience that I can remember having is at the peach bowl (it was either 2002 or 2004). We live in the Atlanta area and my dad gets tickets through work every year to the game. So we usually don't have a stake in either team. We had some extra tickets and their was this family of Tennessee fans that needed tickets. My mom was like "oh they look like a nice clean cut family, why don't we sell our extra tickets to them". We did and they were so thankful, get to are seats in the Dome and they are right next to us. Well the moment the game starts these people turn into the most obnoxious drunk fans I have ever experienced. They were shouting so much that the people in front of us had to ask them to shut up because they were shouting right into their ears. The last straw was when the wife spilt beer on the guy in front of her, security was called and they were escorted out. We have never sold extra tickets to anyone since.  




 I'm not trying to trivialize the issue, what I'm criticizing is that the NFL is all of a sudden caring about this issue and saying that they are going to do more and donate money to charities. When in reality  they are spending so little on domestic violence considering they make $10 billon a year. I'm also criticizing the fact that they partnered with NOmore, an organization that is not a nonprofit and is completely fake seeming to only be for branding http://deadspin.com/do-the-nfls-anti-domestic-violence-initiatives-actually-1682681513

But people see things differently so I can see where you are coming from 




 I don't follow CBB that much, did your team regress or something?  




 I don't think it was an entirely bad idea, it may have just been poor execution (pardon the pun). I think the idea is that instead of promoting their product they are promoting household safety, like the Always commercial isn't promoting their product but treating women with dignity and not ostracizing women/girls.

 for me it's that one, the Fiat one, and clash of clans 




 Clash of clans afford a superbowl ad with Liam Nelson? It was awesome though  




 I tried that thread for a little while but it was awful so I came back here among sane people

 They haven't even produced a real "star" from that show

 I'm surprised Hoda and Katy Lee aren't holding wine glasses in that commercial  




 I know it is, thats why I don't like them because they didn't give a crap about it until Ray

 I would say Boehner and Netanyahu's behavior to Obama was more reprehensible.  




 You think it should be legal and accepted part of society that businesses can discriminate against black and gay people. So again you would be totally fine living in a society where a doctor/paramedic/hospital could refuse service to a minority (whether that minority be gay, black, brown, non-christian etc.)? You think it should be legal for a landlord to be able to kick out/refuse housing to minorities (private business remember). You think it should be legal for a boss to fire someone just because they are gay, black, muslim, jewish, brown etc? I don't think the "free market" would be able to help these people when they end up homeless, out of a job, penny less, or dead. This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS. The big banks crashed the economy by giving out bad loans, people still go to them. GM knew its cars had a potentially deadly flaw that led to multiple deaths, they posted huge sales gains last year. BP spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf causing an environmental catastrophe, people still patronize them. Your idea that discrimination should be totally legal and be settled in the marketplace is flawed because the market has shown that people don't care about "ethics" and all of that stuff, all they care about is a great deal. If the company that gives them that great deal happened to kill a few people, discriminate against people, or poison the environment along the way so be it.

 So Alaska, Western and Northern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, all of Ireland, and part of Scotland to reach $1 trillion. That would be an awesome country.  




 I think Ford Field would be great.  




 look at that unbiased source. The difference is that those laws doesn't allow discrimination. The Indiana bill didn't include any measures to prevent discrimination. Also it is plainly obvious that this law was passed as retaliation against gay people for getting marriage equality.  




 and here's you thoughts on gay people. http://np.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/2yv2c6/opinion_is_georgia_turning_its_back_on_tolerance/cpdetg8 




 Bill was signed into law today, goes into affect in July. 

 




 so you admit this was passed to discriminate against gay people?  




 You really think republicans are going to let gay people become a protected class?  




 You can use the exact same arguement for segregation. You think I makes economical sense to discriminate against gay people?  This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS. The big banks crashed the economy by giving out bad loans, people still go to them. GM knew its cars had a potentially deadly flaw that led to multiple deaths, they posted huge sales gains last year.

 The difference is that Illinois bill doesn't allow discrimination. The Indiana bill didn't include any measures to prevent discrimination.

 Georgia's bill stalled http://thegavoice.com/georgia-religious-freedom-bill-stalls-after-discrimination-amendment-passed/ 




 By that logic then segregation was completely fine and dandy.  




 It stalled http://thegavoice.com/georgia-religious-freedom-bill-stalls-after-discrimination-amendment-passed/ 




 Still defending it I see. 
 




 You have also shown that you don't know anything about the bill. You haven't shown me that it WON'T happen. And no Indiana isn't a terrible place, but because of this bill I will no longer do business there. Have fun while your economy suffers because of this.  




 If I can't find the damn thing how can I make my point. Also I guarantee you haven't read the thing either since the thing is impossible to find online. It's almost like the state of Indiana doesn't want the public to see it. If they didn't want discrimination all Indiana had to do was be like other states and add a provision into the law saying that no one could use this law to discriminate against other people. That fact tell me right there that your politicians don't care about "religious liberty" but are instead a bunch of homophobic bigots. Also the fact that they made this law now after gay marriage became legal says a lot, if this was so important they could have done this 10 years ago when being a bigot was in-vogue. And no one who didn't support this bill would be defending it as hard as you have been on this thread.  




 "And they elected me TWICE" 




 If you don't think the bill is necessary why are you defending it. And I can't even find the damn bill online. Have you actually read the bill? Can you tell me where is says that no one CANNOT discriminate against people?  




 http://www.religionnews.com/2015/03/24/indiana-house-passes-controversial-religious-freedom-bill/ 




 Don't listen to the Bolier guy. He fails to mention that the Indiana bill doesn't have any amendments to protect against discrimination like other laws in other states do.  




 Tell me why this bill is needed.  




 Michele Bachmann isn't in congress anymore. She left last year, and she made is crystal clear it had nothing to do with a federal investigation into financial misconduct during her failed presidential campaign.  




 [The Georgia bill stalled in the house today](http://thegavoice.com/georgia-religious-freedom-bill-stalls-after-discrimination-amendment-passed/). That's right folks Georgia is more progressive than Indiana.  




 Yes it is the intent. Why introduce this now when gay marriage is legal. I have not seen a single argument for this bill. And that is exactly what the bill is about. Discriminating against gay people.  




 That is exactly what the bill is saying. A store can refuse service to you if you are gay.  




 But do they specifically target gay people like the Indiana bill  




 Oh look. Christians passed yet another "Christians may discriminate against everyone, but nobody may discriminate against Christians" law.

Well, what a surprise. 




 Good.

 You can say the same thing about Fahrenheit.  Under 32 is damn cold. Freezing is 32, 40 is cold, 50 is chilly. 60 is cool, 70 is perfect weather, 80 is mild, 90 and above is hot. It is just like Celsius expect units of 10 instead of 5 - simple. 

(Not saying that either is perfect or that one is better than the other, just that the same logic of Celsius can be applied to Fahrenheit)

 More likely that the pilot left for some reason (like going to the bathroom) and while he was gone something happened and the co-pilot either responded wrongly or didn't know how to respond at all, causing the plane to fall and the pilot unable to get back in as the plane fell.

 not give it the members of the US Congress so that they can sabotage US foreign affairs.  




 That is one thing. What Isreal did though was take the information that they got and then gave it to GOP members in congress so that they could sabotage the deal. That is why this is news and probably why Obama doesn't like Bibi so much (among other reasons)  




 There is nothing stoping Cobb or Gwinnett from entering MARTA and "differences " between the counties can easily be resolved. CCT and GCT are just bus service. Its easy for MARTA to come in and simply  replace it. Public transportation is universal, there is nothing that makes it special. It's bus and rail, that's it. CCT and GCT are not special. Funding might be a little different but again nothing stoping Cobb and Gwinnett from joining MARTA. Also the best public transportation systems are large ones that serve the whole region, not a peace meal of regional ones. Looks at the systems in San Francisco, Botson, and Washington dc. They work because they are one system where everyone contributes and everyone benefits.  




 I'll answer your question with a question. What is wrong with MARTA?  




 If you have no problem with the state subsidizing public transportation in Cobb and Gwinnett county but have a problem with the small possibility that Fulton and Dekalb county are subsidizing public transportation in Clayton then you have your priorities out of line. Also there is no legitament reason for Cobb   Gwinnett to reject MARTA. MARTA works just fine, Cobb and Gwinnett don't deserve special treatment and should join MARTA so that we can finally have a universal public transportation system  




 Look at his comment history. It's full of "libtard" and "demtard" comments. If you expect a rational discussion from him you are wrong.

 [Netflix decided not to bit for the rights to Seinfeld after spending $118 million for the rights to Friends](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/amazon-hulu-yahoo-compete-for-seinfeld-reruns-after-netflix-passes/).

 You are failing to recognize that C-Tran was shut down during the worst of the recision when the economy was literally in free fall and governments were slashing everything. With an improved economy there is a chance that Clayton County will be able to contribute enough revenue to MARTA in order to make the whole thing worth while. But regardless I highly doubt that Fulton and Dekalb contribute an equal amount to MARTA funding. If Fulton contributed more than Dekalb you could make the argument that Fulton is subsidizing Dekalb (or vise versa if Dekalb contributed more) so I still don't see what your argument is 




 people who act on their conscious shouldn't be discriminated against 

those gays however, fuck 'em.  




   what this path we are walking down leads to

What path are we leading down to? Nothing has changed. Capitalism is doing great. Stock market is at an all time high and companies are posting record profits.  




 I didn't say you preached hate. I said that I HATE people LIKE YOU - ONE ISSUE VOTERS. In that YOU put GUNS BEFORE PEOPLE. You said you support gay rights, I'm gay and I'm glad you do. HOWEVER the fact that you think guns are more important than me being able to marry the person I love, being able to go to a business and not be turned away because I'm gay, or not being able to be fired just because I'm gay. I support Democrats for more than just their stance on gay rights. You said you vote for the GOP just because of guns. You seem to put guns before people and that is what I don't get. I never said I hated you, I never said that you preached hate, I said (maybe poorly) that your values are misplaced and I didn't like your values.  




 Last one then I'm done. The reason that I HATE people like you is that you chose something as stupid and unnecessary as a gun over the rights of your fellow humans. [This is what republicans are for](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/19/james-lankford-chipotle_n_6904070.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices ir=Gay%20Voices). Again the fact you chose guns over people is something that I can't understand.  




 You and I both know that I'm not going to convince you of anything, so I'm just going to tell you what I think about you, the NRA, the gun lobby, and the pro-gun nuts of this country 




 More guns doesn't stop tragedies, having no guns period stops tragedies. It is people like you that keep electing the GOP to power. Because we have people like you electing the GOP to power we have federal student aid being slashed, food stamps being slashed, women's rights being reduced, gays reduced to second class citizens, and our healthcare under constant threat from being gutted. All because rednecks like got to have guns to compensate for the fact that they are weak pathetic human beings who don't feel complete unless they have a  gun to shoot at people who piss them off. You people are sick. I hope you are happy with yourself that you are ruining this country.  




 I was under the impression that C-Tran failed because the county couldn't afford it once the economy crashed. But I could be wrong.  




 Right because a pistol will do a lot to stop a semi-automatic. I firmly believe that had the amount of ammo in the magazines been restricted, or better yet the gun not be allowed to be sold, that the loss of life would have been a lot lower.  




 Considering that you live in CT makes it even worse that you believe that considering what happened at Newtown. Also are you saying that we use guns to stop people from taking away abortion and gay rights? If so then 1. that is absolutely fucking insane 2. you should start a rampage immediately because all the republicans have been trying to do for the past 3 years is take away gay and abortion rights - put your money where your mouth is.  




 That makes absolutely no sense at all. The Democratic party is not coming to take your guns. All they want AT MOST it universal background checks and to stop the sale of  of semi-automatic weapons (some don't even want to stop their sale but set a limit on the amount of ammo in the magazine to a respectable number like 15 or 20) . It is good to know that you value inanimate object like guns over the rights of women, poor people, and gays.  




 While part of me is like you and is ecstatic at this news another part of me fears he'll actually be elected and become the new Reagan. 
 




 Yes they know. It's kinda hard to miss the camera on the dashboard. I don't know about training but I do know that usually the stuff recorded is stored in a container in the trunk and that only a supervisor can open the case so that the officer can't tamper with it.   




 As a person from Georgia it's one of the following 

1. because they are racists 

2. Because they believe that this is "southern pride" that this is a part of their history and that this history should be celebrated. 

3. They are stupid bros who think it looks cool and want to be rebels.

 NBC/Comcast have nothing to do with the Seinfeld library. Sony has total control over that.  




 I have a few of the season on DVD and while Seinfeld is a hilarious show I don't think if lends itself to binge watching. When you watch the episodes back to back you realize just how ludicrous the show is and how unlikeable/ridiculous the characters are. Many would say "that's the brilliance/joke/point of the show". While this is true I honestly believe that it's best in small doses, otherwise it gets tiring.  




 When you grow up with something it becomes second nature. I know that freezing is 32, I know that 40 is cold, 50 is chilly. 60 is cool, 70 is perfect weather, 80 is mild, 90 and above is hot. Oh looky there round numbers.

 why its bad 

It allows people to use their religion to challenge or opt out of various laws - including local laws in Atlanta and other cities - that protect LGBT people and other minorities from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations. In practical terms, S.B. 129 could allow businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples, a paramedic to refuse to provide life-saving services to an LGBT person, or a school counselor to refuse services to an LGBT teenager. The bill puts minority groups at risk of being denied service everywhere from the convenience store to the doctors office.

 http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20152016/SB/129 




 You don't think it's good, but you think it should be legal and accepted part of society. So again you would be totally fine living in a society where a doctor/paramedic/hospital could refuse service to a minority (whether that minority be gay, black, brown, non-christian etc.)? You think it should be legal for a landlord to be able to kick out/refuse housing to minorities (private business remember). You think it should be legal for a boss to fire someone just because they are gay, black, muslim, jewish, brown etc? I don't think the "free market" would be able to help these people when they end up homeless, out of a job, penny less, or dead. This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS. The big banks crashed the economy by giving out bad loans, people still go to them. GM knew its cars had a potentially deadly flaw that led to multiple deaths, they posted huge sales gains last year. BP spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf causing an environmental catastrophe, people still patronize them.  Your idea that discrimination should be totally legal and be settled in the marketplace is flawed because the market has shown that people don't care about "ethics" and all of that stuff, all they care about is a great deal. If the company that gives them that great deal happened to kill a few people or poison the environment along the way so be it.  




 By that logic then segregation was fine and dandy (for the people who hated Blacks)

 Again if you want to go off of location schools in the [Pac-12 Conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific-12_Conference) and [Mountain West Conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference) are your best bet. But if I were you I would wait until the season starts and see if a school catches your eye.  




 I amended my initial comment as it was a bit inflammatory. You are free to have whatever fiscal views you want. My point is how can gay people vote for (or be excited for) a GOP presidential candidate when the entire GOP presidential field is against gay marriage and protections for LGBT people.  




 My point is that even if you have fiscal conservative views why would you be a member of a party [that clearly hates you]( http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/06/05/3445234/texas-republican-platform-ex-gay/) 




 I'm shocked, SHOCKED that Jeb decided to pander to the religious conservative nut-job base of the republican party.  




 Am I alone in thinking that gay "conservatives" are wrong in the head? How could someone be a member of a party whose leaders clearly hate them.  




 Hey man! He's got a show fixing up houses on HGN or something now

It's even bigger than that man, he's on DIY Network!! 




 Exactly notice how in the last few years opponents have changed the words they use to make them sound "nicer". "anti-gay" become "pro-family" "anti-gay marriage" became "pro traditional marriage" and so on.  




 Where in Canada do you live? If you want to go by region in Canada you could. If you live on the west coast you might choose Washington, Washington State, Oregon, Oregon State, or Boise State. If you live in Manitoba you might root for Minnesota. If you live in Ontario you might root for Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Toledo, East Michigan, Akron, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, or Syracuse. 

There's probably a bunch of schools that I forgot. It also might depend on if you want to root for a powerhouse school, like Michigan, or want to root for a smaller school, like Toledo, and like some other people said you don't have to choose now. Wait until the season starts and if a team catches your eye you can start rooting for them.  




 Let me start out by saying I'm and atheist and hate organized religion. That may add some biased to me when it comes to certain religion affiliated schools (though schools with loose affiliations like TCU and Wake Forest I have less problems with). Let me also state that this hatred of religion comes from me being gay and all churches rejection of me as a human being. 

BU's policy on gays is absolutely stupid. The fact that the ban on gays and gay sex is still in place in 2015 is deplorable. Kids at college age should not be told by their church, much less their school, that they are not welcome on this earth because of the way that they were born. [Brittney Griner's criticism is pretty good at explaining this](http://deadspin.com/brittney-griner-says-baylor-wasnt-a-good-place-to-be-ga-1563484030).  (Also Fox News is not moderately crazy, they are bat shit insane. )

That is my viewpoint about Baylor and the Baptist Church. It might not seem like an unbiased opinion but it's my opinion. As long as Baylor is tied to the Baptist Church I will continue to view it in this light.  




 It needs to be all of them.  




 I'm sorry but I have reason to fear Scott Walker as a presidential candidate. This is a man who how been reelected twice (if you count the recall effort) despite how unpopular he is. He knows how to run a campaign and lets face facts the moment that Hillary starts running all the anti-Clintion stuff will come out of the woodwork (she isn't the best canidate in the world, just least bad.  




 Along with his buddy Thomas.  




 Baylor is still pretty out there in terms of religious craziness, I wouldn't call aiming to be like Baylor an improvement

 Thank God. Now break up Comcast like AT T was in the 80s  




 You are implying that the state of Louisiana cutting taxes caused to the GLOBAL price of oil to fall. That is ludicrous and I never said such a thing. If you can't understand that I didn't not see the point in continuing to argue with you.  




 I never claimed that cutting taxes are to be blamed for falling oil prices, I have no idea where you get that idea. The only thing I cited was that the tax cuts made things bad, low oil prices (a completely different issue from govt funding) made things worse because it means lower revenue than what they would have had if the prices were higher. To be clear low taxes didn't cause low oil prices, and I never claimed as such. Low taxes on high oil prices brings in more revenue than low taxes on low oil prices, that is it. Also I never said that there can't be cuts, my issue is that so much has already been cut how much is there left? 


also I never laid all the blame on low taxes, I lay the majority of the blame 




 Well that isn't because of a tax cut, is it? I mean, can you show me how LA tax cuts have cratered the world wide price of oil? If not, then placing all the blame on taxes is just silly.

Of course falling oil prices aren't because of taxes. The point is that Jindal was banking on high oil prices to help the state out of the huge hole they put themselves in and didn't have a plan B just in case. 

Again, raising taxes is only one option/tool there. The other option/tool is to address the spending that has increased $2B from 2012 to 2014.The fact that they choose not to question the spending side of the equation doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or that it is automatically all because of less taxes.Call me crazy, but I doubt that the tax increases somehow magically caused spending to rise by $2B in 2 years, but I'm happy to look at what you've got.

First this statement doesn't make any sense to me. The state is in a $1.6B budget gap, you don't get that way by just increasing spending you get that way by cutting revenue as well. You can't get out of this mess by just cutting everything, you need to raise revenue as well. If you cut everything you end up with shitty road, schools, government services etc. You keep sighting this $2B and yet I can find that figure in the document you provided in another comment (could you at least cite a page or pages, I don't have time to read a 120pg document). Also how could tax increases cause spending to rise? More to the point they didn't raise taxes at all, they cut them or let them stay as is. This contributed to the mess they are in. 
 




  Year after year, Louisiana didn't have enough money to cover its expenses, yet Gov. Bobby Jindal refused to roll back income tax cuts or ever-increasing corporate tax breaks. Instead, he raided reserve funds and sold off state property.Jindal suggested job growth from his economic development wins would replenish those assets once the recession ended. It hasn't  and money from the lucrative oil industry has taken a nose dive with crude prices. Now, the Republican is running out of short-term patches and is struggling to plug a $1.6 billion budget hole just as he tries to build support for a possible 2016 presidential run.

[source: The (Baton Rouge) Advocate ](http://theadvocate.com/news/11576704-123/out-of-tricks-how-louisiana) 

Most blame the $1.6 billion budget gap on Jindals rigid refusal to raise taxes, which originates in a pledge he signed with Grover Norquist, sultan of the GOPs anti-tax wing. For years, Jindal has been siphoning money from dedicated funds or one-time payouts to make up for the states lack of revenue.Now, even members of his own party are criticizing him for his management of Louisianas finances.

[source: The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/03/19/louisiana-is-so-poor-that-it-cant-afford-to-hold-presidential-primaries-in-2016/)  




 It should be noted that Louisiana got in this mess because they cut taxes by a huge amount when their current governor, Bobby Jindal, came to office. Now they are hesitant to raising them to stop the bleeding and no deal is in sight at the moment.

 It is a title loan place. 
In the United States, a car title loan, also called an auto title loan, vehicle title loan, pink slip loan, or simply title loan, is a type of secured loan where the borrower can use their vehicle title as collateral. Borrowers who get title loans must allow a lender to place a lien on their car title, and temporarily surrender the hard copy of their vehicle title, in exchange for a loan amount. When the loan is repaid, the lien is removed and the car title is returned to its owner. If the borrower defaults on their payments then the lender is liable to repossess the vehicle and sell it to repay the borrowers outstanding debt.

 The Chattahoochee River is damed in North Georgia (Lake Lanier) and is a vital supply of drinking water for the Atlanta area. Naturally Georgia doesn't like to let too much water out because we need it. However Alabama and Florida also claim the water, and would like more released for their own needs. Alabama needs it for its nuclear power plants along the Chattahoochee.  Florida needs lots of water because the more water released from Lake Lanier the more rich nutrients are realized that shrimp feed on at the mouth of the river in the Gulf of Mexico. These shrimp are an important part of the fishing industry there. Without the nutrients the shrimp population suffers and so does the fishing industry.

The station is the 180th TV market (out of 210) so the station isn't making bang by any means do to its small viewing audience. On top of that the station has gone through multiple owners who have had no interest in investing in the station at all. It's actually a miracle that it lasted this long and it is unlikely that the show will continue without him. If you notice the video in the WSJ link at the top the youngest people there seemed to be in their 50s. A lot of the Finnish culture/language there is slowly eroding as time goes by.

 Don't like that electric vehicle owners are now being taxed so much for owning an electric car (I would be fine with a small tax but the one here seems too steep), also don't like that they got rid of the electric car tax credit as thats a big reason why you see so many electric cars on the road here. But all in all it looks like a decent bill (certainly better than what we have had the past ten years).  




 I think it was mostly finally seeing that Delta doesn't need tax breaks and looking for money that didn't involve a tax increase. Though a part of me thinks that this was conservatives retaliating against Delta for blocking the "religious freedom" bill last year (though that's just speculation on my part). Regardless the reason it's quite obvious that Delta doesn't need them.  




 Pressure can make a difference. It's better than nothing, though I would prefer a veto.

 Arkansas bill is exactly like Indiana's in that it states a "person" is "an individual, association, partnership, corporation, church, religious institution, estate, trust, foundation or other legal entity". this opens up the possibility of businesses using religion to discriminate. This is the key difference between the Arkansas and Indiana laws, and the federal law
 




 contact the governor http://governor.arkansas.gov/contact-info 




 The key difference is that the federal version is just about a single person, the Arkansas version states a "person" is "an individual, association, partnership, corporation, church, religious institution, estate, trust, foundation or other legal entity". this opens up the possibility of businesses using religion to discriminate.

 Yes but so far in everything that has come out Blatter hasn't been indicated. On top of that this is a man who has shown that he doesn't give a damn about PR or the press.

 the main reason i posted it 

 





























 I'm with you. This is a great plan. The neighborhoods in that area are , lets be honest, shit. It's empty lots and abandoned houses. This is literally the best plan to replace Turner Field. Much better than imploding the stadium and leaving it an empty lot (as if the area needed another one of those). Plus this will bring actual development to the area, something that the baseball stadium never did. 

 









 NBC has shown Olympics coverage in the past on NBCSN, Bravo, CNBC, msnbc, USA, and Oxygen. Actually NBCUniversal owns more channels than ESPN. If NBC wanted to they could also show Olympics coverage on E!, The Weather Channel, Golf Channel, Esquire Network, Chiller, Cloo, and syfy. So it's not lack of channels that's the problem, its the lack of will on NBC's part. Now maybe with the success of their live premier league games and live ice skating coverage during the Olympics last year they will change. But I'm not too confident.  




 NBC almost got the Pac-12 contract but ESPN didn't want to give it away and was willing to swallow their pride and co-bid with Fox. NBCSN also bid on The American contract and ESPN outbid again. ESPN doesn't want to give NBCSN a foot in the door. Also ESPN won't sub-license games to them. It isn't in ESPN's interest to give NBCSN programing. ESPN doesn't mind giving CBSSN or FSN some games because they aren't a threat to them. Most conferences are signed to long term deals. The only conference whose contract is up soon is the B1G. You can bet your ass that ESPN won't give that up (plus Fox might make a play as well).

 The NCAA doesn't let any tournament events go on in South Carolina or Mississippi because of their embrace of the confederate flag. This has been official policy since 1999. Since then SC has added major production facilities for BMW and Boeing and just announced a new plant for Volvo (even Mississippi has added a production facility for Toyota), and Gov. Nikki Haley has said that no CEOs have mentioned the flag to her as a problem. I don't see anything changing in the future.  




 It doesn't need to be banned. It just shouldn't be flown on the lawn of the South Carolina legislature. There is too much baggage associated with the flag. If you think it's "southern pride" then fly it on your own property. That flag was flown by traitors who rebelled against the US government. No state should embrace that flag 

[(this applies to Mississippi as well)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mississippi)

Note: Born and raised in Georgia and always associated that flag with racism. 

edit: spelling and grammar.  




 That scene had me laughing because their reactions were hilarious.

I had to cut all the fat off before I could even start cutting the meat that was on there 




 They did the same at my school. They threw left overs on the pizza or made a sandwich out of it. The options were meatloaf sandwiches and macaroni and cheese pizza  




 I went to a small school. Meal plans were required to be bought if you lived on campus and were included as part of room/board fees. 

 




 The employees were some of the nicest people you'd ever meet. There were several older ladies that that adored the students and the students loved them back. It was the Aramark management that was shitty and only cared about cutting corners whenever they could. Even the employees there acknowledged that the food was awful.  












































 Aramark was in charge of my college dining hall. It was awful  




  Fox's contract for the B1G title game will also expire when the current ESPN contract expires . So whoever the B1G signs on with will get the championship game 

But I do agree that I don't see nbc signing on with an exclusive B1G contract as football games in the fall would probably interfere with their EPL and nascar coverage . Now if it's a shared package (ala the pac 12 with ESPN and Fox) then NBC might sign on

  Pixar movies have always done that. Cartoonish characters on realistic backgrounds. 

But there is something about the background here in "The Good Dinosaur" that seems more real than it usually does. When you look at the trees, grass, water, mountains, and everything else it looks so much more real than it usually does in a Pixar movie. I mean not even the coral reef in Finding Nemo looked as real as the background in this trailer did (at least in my opinion). The contrast with this real background compared to the dinosaur really bothered me. Maybe the lack of dialog had me focusing on the background more than usual, or maybe it was the fact that the dinosaur is so cartoonish that he seemed out of place. I don't know. 

Other than that I liked the trailer. No plot given away, just music and scenes of a (possible?) budding friendship. It actually made me more interested in the movie. 
 



























































 I'm assuming that the computer system is one of many projects that they want to use the $175 million for.

 I had no idea that Canada was such a terrorist hot spot. His father is from Jordan so he likely went (possibly under the ruse) to see extended family and then snuck into nearby Syria or Iraq (this is of course assuming that the guy carried this out in the name of radical Islam, while all initial signs point to that there is still no statement from the FBI on why he did this). Also Jordan is one of the U.S.'s allies in the Middle East, it isn't crawling with terrorist groups like Syria, Afghanistan, or Iraq so visiting there wouldn't raise any red flags.  
























 *sigh* I'm not even surprised anymore  



















 I know, unfortunately the GOP has run a successful union busting ring here for the past 50 years. The regional airlines here are separate companies that use non union pilots and are contracted out by the big 3 airlines (Delta, United, and American) to fly smaller planes ([40 to 80 seat planes like this](http://www.flugzeuginfo.net/acimages/crj700er_kp.jpg)) from their hubs to small cities, think Chicago to Green Bay. They are staffed by pilots just out of flight school so they are desperate to get their "dream job" and go to work for regional airlines because the larger ones won't hire you out of flight school. The regional airlines know that they don't have to pay a high salary because there are plenty of eager pilots in line to get a job. In a perfect world you spend a few years flying for a regional airline then get hired by the Delta's, United's, Southwest's and JetBlue's of the world. But that doesn't always happen.  




 About damn time they spoke out  




 Not having minimum wage in the US 

The U.S. has a minimum wage, it's not high but it  does exist.  




 Nothing. Ryanair will still fly to Denmark. It's just that now the crews and planes will be based in other countries (like Germany, Lithuania, UK, etc.) instead of Denmark. So the employees will no longer be "employed" in Denmark but in Germany, UK etc.   




 He should work for the regional airlines here in order to know what it's like to be an underpaid pilot. They make only $23,000 a year.  




 Reminds me of the situation here in the states when a few months ago Walmart suddenly closed about 5 stores in various states due to "plumbing issues", laying off all the staff in the process. The company and not filed any construction permits with the local governments concerning plumbing work and Walmart said that the stores would reopen in about 6 months. Rumor has it they closed the stores to stop people from unionizing  



















 Then you better vote and get your friends involved.

 There was the special they aired about the guy with the 132 pound scrotum.  




 They pulled reruns when shit hit the fan. This announcement is them officially canceling it. 

 




 [What is known about him at this point]( http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2015/jul/16/what-we-know-about-chattanooga-shooter/315002/) 





























 They are probably employed by a company called Veritas that AT T hired to do door to door sales for them. I know this because I applied for a "Management Trainee" job at that company a few months back. I went to the initial interview and was invited back for a 7 hour "day in the life" event to see how the company operatives and was told it would be business professional. Get there having no clue what to expect. Told to go with this guy and  this girl (the girl had only been there a week). It quickly became clear what this job really was. I felt like an absolute idiot for not picking up on the red flags sooner, I had just graduated college so I was desperate and didn't think. So here I was walking around the poor/lower middle class part Akworth in dress shoes and a suit all day in the May sun sweating my ass off doing nothing but watching these people try to sell AT T U-verse to people who can't afford it. The whole thing was BS. The guy even said to the new girl "don't sell the cheap package sell the expensive one". And the whole spiel they gave to people was complete BS too.  Like you said, given a huge list of addresses in a certain area and have to cover it multiple times to make sure you catch the person.  




 Like /u/Coup_Soup said it's to make sure that you catch a person while they're home. Plus in some cases the person that answers the door will say that "I don't handle that stuff, so-and-so does. They'll be here around _____" so you go back to ask the "person in charge".  
























 My Grandma calls it commode as well, she's from Eastern Virginia.  




 I've seen yellow lids too.  




 I don't know what his ratings at 5pm were like. I do know that his ratings at 11pm were bad because sporting events would delay his show or push it over to ESPNEWS leading to an inconsistent air time and channel.  




 At least they kept the "home" in Home   Garden Television. TLC has nothing to do with learning anymore 




 Holtz retired, May is still under contract with ESPN, Cowherd probably got a better offer from Fox, Olbermann left because ESPN wanted to censor his criticism of the NFL, and Simmons was a mix of wanting too much money and ESPN trying to censor him from criticizing the NFL and ESPN personalities/shows *cough* First Take *cough* . 

 




 They are also in the process of budget tightening. They have lots of personalities contract's coming up this year, so it's all about choosing who is worth paying. Simmons was a case of wanting too much money and being critical of the NFL, Olbermann was being too critical of the NFl, and now Cowherd is probably wanting too much money. FWIW they have already resigned Stephen A. Smith to a new contract. 

 
























 The Duggars are huge anti-gay bigots. They were instrumental in getting an LGBT non-discrimination ordinance in Fayetteville, Arkansas repealed last year. They said that Trans people were child molesters, which is ironic since their son was a child molester.
