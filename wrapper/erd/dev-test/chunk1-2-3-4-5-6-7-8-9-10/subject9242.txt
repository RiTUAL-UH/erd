 I just found out at 22 I was the child not of my father, but instead of my mother and a sperm donor who had Croatian citizenship at the time (the procedure took place in New Orleans in the early 90s if it matters). 

I automatically had American citizenship at birth by being born of an American and by being born in America, but now that I suspect I could get Croatian citizenship I am very interested in acquiring it. 

The Croatian bills regulating it suggest you need to settle the matter before you are 18, yet I did not know of my true origin. 

Also of note, I am not sure if he fled as a refugee in the 1990s, and I know a lot of the laws are different and written with the aim of resolving stateless citizens, so I am not sure if I could inherit citizenship if he was fleeing refugee wise. 

I should have access to proof of my origin via the fertility clinic, so is there a possibility of getting citizenship?  

I will link the relevant text of the Croatian legal code. 

The gentleman in question likely signed away the kinds of rights in regard to actions such as child support or whatnot, but I doubt that still includes the ability to confer citizenship. Is that the case?

I am older than 18 and not on the register of Croatian citizens, so I have no idea what to do and I presume this will involve a fair amount of paperwork even if I find all of the documentation. 

Thanks in advance.

 How?  Bernie Sanders has an economic platform that benefits groups in poverty, which are disproportionately African American and Woman American. 

By teaching people how voting Bernie Sanders will vote themselves money via common sense middle class economic ideas, like raising the minimium wage and expanding social security, Bernie Sanders can beat Hillary Clinton. 

It is just a matter of educating and teaching people why voting for neoliberalism never works.

 Agreed. I don't think he will run, and if he does he will be competing for HRC voters, not those of Bernie Sanders.

Glophosphate (roundup) DOES have legitimate concerns about overuse and the ubiquity with which it is applied, but it isn't dangerous in the sense that something like lead is. 

Glyophosphate only lasts for like a few hours before it denatutes and becomes harmless, it isn't something that would harm you if someone sprayed it on your food a week before it was harvested. And it isn't sprayed soon before harvest, so a lot of the baseless concerns seem to be ridiculous.

 What is fucked is that the elderly/"low income" people get these sweet apartments subsidized, and middle class or like 80 percent of the country get fucked. 

The luxury condos often are allowed to be built at a higher density if they have a portion that is below market rent. Now this goes beyond the federal affordable housing programs, and makes rhe upper middle class responsible for housing the urban poor,which is controveral in the firdt place. It is like taxing your home. 

What it also does is upbids and increases the price that the middle class has to pay, as there are even larger blocks of people who are taking up housing stock at a subsidized rate. 


Really I think zoning needs to be relaxed in many places to promote infill, smaller units, multifamily, and independently managed apartments. 


It is most profitable to only do luxury units because they make more money and have more stable clients, so when the government puts a bunch of red tape on a market that has little interest in it, it is pretty damn hard. 


I wish we had more unconventional housing in odds and ends,  on top of buildings, multistory, housing connected to workplaces and the like. 

Europe has a lot more housing like that, but instead we have our workplace/entertainment/housing rigidly seperated thanks to zoning in most places. My large street where I lived a while back had no food/gas on the whole street because all of it was zoned residential, and it seemed like such a clusterfuck not to have those amenities. 

Even the rental market is heating up a good bit, but there are so few units vacant and new ones are at a higher price point, so many people don't save money doing it. 

I will likely just get roomates well into my future as a young professional and invest the saved money. 

I will not pay 1450 a month in rent plus utilities and comcast to boot. I am more than happy to share a washing machine and actually keep my money. 

If housing prices weren't artificially subsidized by the mortgage interest deduction, the deductability of taxes on a house, and artificially low interest policies/zero interest rate policies, the value of homes would fall back into equilibrium. Somethinng like a lower multiple of average yearly income than where it is now.  




 A lot of communities that are older fear too many kids will raise property taxes, which fund schools. Having only seniors move into their city/neighborhood can in theory save a little bit on taxes in the short term, but really hinders the region. This kind of thing forces young and middle aged people to commute from further out if they are going to work a job. 

It really is discriminatory and needs to be cracked down on. It is highly ageist.

 Getting a roomate he basically knows he will make 500-1000 a month. Getting a mortgage for another property would add debt and the liability of taking care of the house, and what happens if real estate values decline and the house becomes underwater?

I just mean getting a roomie is by and far the most simplistic solution with little downside relatively speaking.

 Dad already has a house. A much easier solution is either moving out somewhere cheaper and renting the house, or getting a roomie for his current situation.  




 Stop the double payment, pay the minimum, and put that money that your dad had been putting extra into the mortgage into an IRA or other savings vehicle 




 How many rooms does his house have?  This may sound silly, but getting a roomate for a few years would give him a lot more cash flow and cut his expenses on things like utilities in half.

 Even a lot of the formerly good second tier cities are appreciating too much to make them a good value.

 Do what you have to do to survive. How many beds/baths is your place?  

I plan on either buying one of the few "entry" level homes for 130k and living in one bedroom while I rent the other.

If you and your wife life in a relatively large home/condo, getting a roomie may be a wise move. Even in a year or two you will have saved a bunch of cash without more hours at work.  




 Exactly. Even if you get one and it appreciates, unless you get a bunch of roomies and charge through the nose in rent, the taxes/HOA will eat you alive. Unless you sell, in which case you no longer have somewhere to live. 

But you might make a handsome profit.  




 One word. 

Bernie Sanders for President.  




 And consider that they may never be able to buy into the market like boomers did. People in nyc/sf/portland where the prices may grow 3/4 percent yearly mean that their income, even high ranking nationally, may not keep pace with prices.  A lot of people in these cities bought decades ago when homes were relatively inexpensive in comparison to income.  




 It is like any big industry. Buy up all the market and make the rules so nobody can enter the market and raise barriers to entry. 

Blackrock did the same on a national scale, buying up massses of rental properties.

 The situation of owning a home.

If you can get a decent differential between renting out your main place and renting an efficiency, it can be a pretty sweet arrangement.

I know that couple, and even though they do not need to do that because of fiscal hardship, it is still a really great way to monetize their home.

Just look at how much your house would rent for vs how much you could rent a one bedroom for.  

I know you live in a cheap COL area, but I know people that are grossing an extra 2k/month from this if they have a nice house.  That would give you a lot more cash flow and equity on your home, even just in a few years.

 \over 50 economic migrants settled in europe and likely on the dole. Vote Milibong lads!

FTFY 




 "Experiencing war". 


Is that why they come from like Eritrea, which is not at war, refuse to file asylum at any country on the way, and don't accept asylum in countries like France and Italy?  Ffs it is a farce and they are overwhelmingly ecpnomic migrants.  














 All of the ethnic minorities of american renaissance. Lol 




 I am filing for economic asylum. 

We don't have unuversal healthcare 




 Can't I just get an asylum? 




 I wanted to move. I work at starbucks in Ohio but could really see myself being Norwegian, or maybe finnish, I like death metal and black sabbath. 

I had to withdrawl from collards for grades, but am looking to immigrate or get asylum. I have my money saved up for a ticket and am leaving soon. 

Which cities are best?  I am so ready to move to a forward thinking place where healthcare is free and the government takes care of people. I love the diverse vibe in cities like Oslo too, it is awesome. I can really see my life improving where I have more opportunity. 

Ciao!

Dude what? 




 Can you distance yourself from the parents? 




 The jig is up boomers/bankers. 

We don't want your expensive crap.  




 This fall on CBS!!!

 ..and most of the medical research confirms this.  




 Who drinks a six pack of monsters in a sitting? 




 These drinks have comperable amounts of caffeine to coffee. It isn't heroin.  




 \I can't sleep ergo nobody in my age class can have this. 

This is a little controlling right? 




 Oh yeah?  Did you go to some TTT law school or something? 




 Complete with yellow or brown filling!

 That isn't true. Please stop sullying Senator Saunder's record.

 Basically all of our history was progressing until the baby boomers too over the country?  That is what the numbers show.  




 Also of geopolitical importance, much like the Jewish community in America, their population is pretty urban. The largest concentrations of Armenian Americans are in a few pockets of Calfornia, which I would wager gives them more social capital and networking of political importance than had they ended up in the Mississippi Delta, like a few Syrians and Chinese immigrants did prior to the 1900s. 

Not to sound too crass but basically I think being in California made them a lot more influential than had they ended up in Eastern New Orleans like the Vietnamese refugees generally did.  




 But I mean does like semen even count as a food?

You can't buy it in a grocery store.  




 Semper fuckdellis!

 If you are american but have relative ease getting a croatian passport is it worth doing?

 




 This is SF. She may have been okay with it to boot. Nothing wrong with that.

 Does swallowing during ramadan before sundown count as being haraam or is it okay?

 Look at where DF is in comparison.  




 Fuck gawker.  












































 Look at his username. You think you will get serious discourse here? 




 Grandpappy bush literally worked as a business consultant for the third reich and helped to try and organize a fascist coup against the FDR in the 1930s.  




 Hillary is a neoliberal 




 Obama is a scam 




 It is portuguese-mozambican chicken and I think the whole periperi thing came from macau.

 I don't know how people can be so close minded to middle class economics.  














 Ffs even a lot of them. If you allow new counstruction the investment is really good. They pay property taxes.  




 I think it is a big miscalculation on China's part. 

These kind of actions just polarize countries against china. This is how they end up alone internationally and going to war. Even with significant oil, reduced trade could still be more costly than potential oil.  




 [Motherhood Intensifies] 




 Law is already being automated. Ever heard of e discovery? 




 What is funny is that a lot of commentators act like chinese aggression in the region over islands is new, but they have done this in the 1970s and whatnot to taiwan and vietnam as well 
























 Literalaaaaaaay 




 Posting in a gaybros thread!  Have a good fapday ladies! 




 Where did you go for blizzcon?  A lot of cities/tates have hotel and food and beverage taxes to get cash out of tourists and add to the taxes they get from hosting events 




 The people are a large part of the problem. Lots of drugs, vice, low education et cetera 




 The health coverage wasnt manditory before obamacare. Why did they cut it?

Obamacare reduced their incentives to treat their employees right. 

Not everything is the corporate world's fault. 

By making healthcare more inclusive and harassing no frills plans, poor people and the working class got thrown under the bus by obamacare.  




 Dont forget the stupid 40 hour rule bullshit 




 Many people in cities don't do the things thier density allows them. It isn't an either or thing, and the stereotypes that the suburbs are boring are kind of black and white.  




 Jaden smith is the product of scientology

 Lots and lots of redbull and singing madonna to stay awake.  




 Thanks for manning the NSA data center in AUS. 

Go back home GI.  




 \in the uk the news has to be impartial

Uh, wut 




 Aka reddit 




 I was talking to my family about this. If the government is just going to originatw and give credit for loans to banks from the fed/fha/fannie/freddie, why not do the credit screening and origination by the fha and not give credit for private stuff and cut the profit?  It is BS that the guarantors and source of credit privatize the gains and socialize the losses. Either we subsidize them or not. Basically the way it is set up now makes it more advantageous for the banks than homeowners.  




 Anuka honey does have antimicrobial properties that are pretty well substantiated. 

Organics is generally baseless though.  




 Thank you for your service.  




 Progessive is very gay friendly as well.  




 I see this all the time at the post office. Three baby boomers chatting and reading the paper and a college girl is doing all the work at the counter. Wtf.  




 Liberalizing the laws would be more reasonable. Only punish people selling fake tickets.  




 I'm-bi-zim 




 Cities waste a hell of a lot more on bullshit than libraries. Probably one of the few things with a decent ROI.  




 Seriously copy the pimsleur courses at the library. It is like 600 dollars new.  




 He wrote some plays where the government had these terrible bureaucratic offices and people use that word to describe sort of really confusing office bullshit. Franz Kafka. He grew up in eastern europe. He wrote "metamporphasis" 




 And tenths and portcullises

 But drug prohibition is religious findamentalism, and when I make artificial barriers to the free flow of capital, people won't just go to worse and more predatory forms of lending with less oversight! /s

 There was a version with a gay guy of sorts. It was pretty interesting, at least more than whatever duggar bullshit is on TV

 Have you ever seen "playinng it straight on youtube"?  It is a show where a bunch of gay and straight guys all try to get a gay guy to pick them as their final date person guy. And the gay suitor doesn't find out a few are straight till a few episodes in.
