Bartender comes back a little bit later and since its a pretty slow night, he decides to chit-chat with the customer. After a little bit the bartender asks the man what he does for a living. 

Customer says, "I'm a Center for the Dallas Cowboys."

Bartender replies, "Man, it must be really tough having to do that."

"Its not too bad. I enjoy it" 

"No, I meant being openly gay in Texas."

 I know its a bit out of context for a lot of us, however I've been mostly free for a bit now, though I feel lie I'm starting to fall into depression again. (Bi-polar II / manic depressive since I was a kid.) 

Back story; Met a lovely lady a year (around abouts) ago at a mutual friend's birthday party. Nice woman, perhaps a bit drunk, talked a while, facebook friends later. 

Get to talking, she's pretty cool, works in graphic design, responds positively to advances, sexual exchanges including suggestive photographs even though she's in a relationship (I knew) plus she's 13 years older (I'm mature, she's immature). 

We continue talking, life, love, sex all that, advances that she reciprocates to the extent of still being with someone. (Nothing ever happened though it very well could have. Yes, I know. Cheats with you, cheats on you.)

Around her birthday, her BF dumps her, kicks her out, for reasons that she either didn't tell me or he never told her. After a while she agrees to go to lunch with me and then the next week come over and let me make her dinner and watch a movie with drinks. 

Week later, she has to skip dinner because she said she found out he cheated on her and was feeling sick as a result, then tells me later that week she has started seeing someone and that she is confused why I would be upset about this as she told me she couldn't date someone who worked at a bar or who was younger. 

I didn't take this as she thought I would, and that she thought she made that clear before. Back and forth for a few weeks, things said in anger and with inhibition on both sides. 

Anyway, I get past that, ask her how its going, blah blah blah, ask her about her drinking. 

She says she stopped a few weeks ago. (lightbulb) I say good that she stopped drinking so much as it elt like half the times I talked to her she had been. 

And of course, it appears she was. 

Fucking of course, clearly no one could be interested in me unless they were drunk half the time. I don't even know why I try. 

This is more of a rant about the slide of someone with the history of depression than the life of, But, IDFC shit happens.

 I was diagnosed when I was 11. Every step I have taken since has tightened the noose around my neck. High School was easy, living with the possibility of escape in alcohol is difficult. I'm 27. I work as a bouncer in a club. I might be good at it, but the discount on drinks is worth even more. I work 3 nights a week, and the nights I'm off, I spend $40-80 on cheap whiskey. 

Ever wonder what life is like when you have barriers no one will break?

I like to call it The Slide. You know its happening, you know why, but there isn't a damn thing you can do about it.

Do you know what its like to ask for help and the only response you get is silence? Ever wonder what life is like when you ask yourself if you have to kill someone to fucking notice?

Something the size of a pen that could detect what color something is. You'd put it up to the color you want to 'collect' and you could store like 500 or so colors. Then you could hook it up to a computer and you would see all the different colors you caught and the hex code and the Pantone or other companies info on the color. 

There would be different levels of product- RGB or CMYK; 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 captures; how nice the pen looks (like a nice fountain pen); bluetooth connectivity to your tablet or phone so you can check the color if you'd like. 



















 I've been working on a campaign for a local candidate and I needed to find a way to describe him in a tagline.

 I had a motorcycle accident when I was 19. I saw her crossing the traffic, I had the right of way, she just pulled in front of me. Nothing I could do. 

I lived in Florida at the time and the only thing that went through my head was "I hope she has insurance." I was wearing my helmet and it's a good thing I was because there's no graceful way to land when you flip head first over and 35 feet past a car. 

Broke my clavicle and needed surgery, its a good thing she had insurance otherwise I would have been fucked for years. FHP at the hospital told me I was lucky, most of the motorcycle accidents he saw were deaths or in so much pain they couldn't answer questions.

 What kind of maggot gives people gold for puns? 




 Example:

The bar I used to work at Served Evan Williams Green Label at $3.50 a drink. Retail A fifth is ~$10.00. IF you get 20 servings from a bottle, 3.50 x 20 = 70. That's a 700% markup. Until you factor in rent, electric, maintenance, labor (and this really depends on location) etc, that bottle is 2-3x as expensive. 

The markup for anything is a significant amount, if you don't include overhead. 




 Ahh, drummer jokes.

 Accidental overdose maybe. Aderall, Ritalin, etc are considerably more safe than legal opioids or cocaine. 

Having used these types of drugs, you would have to experience considerable pain before you do major damage to yourself. 




 Well, didn't Aston make a shitty hatchback? 




 I've had about half a fifth of whiskey and it made sense in the manner that you were saying that coke was responsible for many deaths. 

Though, going back, I understand you were saying that legal amphetamines were responsible for many deaths, and on that I would have to disagree wholesale. The numbers do not suggest that RX amphetamines are killing remarkably large numbers of people.

 It depends on if you have a citizen working that tile after the improvement is completed. Citizen management can be adjusted if you click on the city and look at the drop down menu on the right.

If your city is not well fed, the ai may choose to put a citizen on a farm before hills or a mine. Or, if you have bonuses to tiles that may seem more useful. (Like if you have the sacred path pantheon with give +1 to jungle tiles.) 

Long answer short, yes your worker will likely be produced sooner, but if you want to make sure, citizen management in the the city screen is a good reference.

 It's more the idea that you have taken a pain reliever boosts its perceived ability upwards of half. 

So, if you took a sugar pill and was told it was tylenol or whatever, you would have some reduction in pain. Likewise, if you took a pill and were told it was a sugar pill, the pain reduction would be diminished. 

And this study was for OTC pain relievers, not opioids.  




 I saw a study that said ~43% of statistics are made up on the spot.  




 Saw a study that suggested upwards of 50% of a pain reliever's effect was placebo, people expecting it to work. 

So even if it does nothing, it could still do something. 




 Why would you... the fuck is wrong with you dude?

What did you say about mathematically impossible? 




 Its actually a brilliant move. They drown out competition, increase consumer confidence so they buy those big trucks again, and when the prices go back up there will still be competition, but the price will be even higher, allowing them to step in and buy the companies supplying the tar sands type oil. 

I mean yeah there's some niche shit to it, but damn, I hope they use lube on us later. Of course it might be too expensive. 




 No. But the level at which they decide to produce does have a direct effect on prices, in a less supply = higher prices way. 




 You just made a statement where you contradict yourself and that example is crap. 

Just so you know. 
 




 Holy shit. 




 I like pizza and cheap tvs. Deal with it ya damn hippie. 




 How do you figure? Instability equals a much less stable market. One government falling in the region has a huge impact on the market price for oil. 

And no serious coalition will form, its like herding cats, who have guns. 




 Back in my day we only had 3 channels and we liked it that way.

Seriously though, at least House was on, daytime TV is shit. 




 My point was more of once the oil prices start going back up hard to reach oil like the tar sands is going to become a viable source again. 

"Which could count as a geopolitical win in the Mid East region." 

We want that region as stable as possible, the fracturing of Iraq is the perfect example. Removing the leaders of a country with that many different tribes and sects all wanting the money is insane. 




 Eh, its a body part. Can get mixed up in the process. 




 Ugh. Conspiracy theories are so stupid. 




 Apparently some people have a misunderstanding of what Foul Bachelor Frog is all about. 




 A safeword should be a calm sounding word. Not too many hard consonants.

 It's a delaying of the inevitable. I do think the Saudis are trying to drive the competition away, but as long as there is money to be made... 

Another aspect people don't get is that unless the US subsidizes oil in a serious manner, we will still be effected. Oil goes to market first, then it ends up at the consumer.

 I dunno, I don't really want to have to deal with sjw nuts freaking out about slavery and whatnot for a game I really enjoy. 




 I'd like to see revolution like a civil war. Your cities can break off into another civ. Same UU UA and UB but with a Revolutionary Leader. 

I think that would be pretty damn cool. Flex number of empires would be a nice feature in general. Oh, this is a peaceful game and everyone is basically trying for a culture victory? Well, here's Attila or some other war civ. 




 I would make the supply line separate from the traditional trade route in that it doesn't really provide gpt for either. Maybe +1-2 for the owner. 

And I like the idea of supply lines because it allows for the FOBs.  




 So I've seen some good ideas to make war a bit more realistic, and it seems that most revolve around units. I have a few ideas that might change the mechanics of war.

Supply lines. Acts like a trade route to friendly cities that boosts military unit production and maybe city defenses. You could prop a city state to defend itself against another civ or a frontier city. 

Forward operating base. Much like a citadel without the adjacent damage, grants 75% defensive bonus and can be removed. If a supply line is attached it allows you to upgrade adjacent units you control for 33% more gold cost.


Unhappiness. For every 5 military units destroyed or captured in foreign lands unhappiness increases by 1. For every 5 enemy military units captured or destroyed in your land happiness increases by 1. The difference is reduced by one per turn after a peace treaty is signed.

 Holy fuck, you are a goddamn moron. Use of examples, you stupid shit, are not the whole but part. 

I have been saying, if you weren't to goddamned retarded to understand, that the top 5% of worldwide equates to like the top half of the US. So the implication that his family was super rich, WHEN HELD IN CONTEXT OF THE FUCKING COMMENT, is not as impressive as you claim it to be, you spineless, over-educated, under a stimulated twat. 




 I'm not discounting that compared to sub-saharan Africa or Amazonian Peru that's impressive, but when you put it in the US, not exactly fantastical. 




 Yes? 




 I always looked at it like this. You have X capacity to deal with crap. So you stuff the important things in and kind of ignore the rest. 

When you don't have to worry about eating, paying bills on time, or if you'll go broke because you have to go to the er to get anti-biotics, then you fill the tank with things that may seem trivial to many.

Is there something bothering you, having a rough day, what?  




 No shit dude, but in the context of your comment, not a big deal. 




 You do realize that top 5% isn't really that impressive. If that were people based he could be the 300 millionth richest person on the planet. That's middle class-ish. 

If you figure the average family is 2 adults, 2.2 kids you have 7 billion/4.2 you get 1 billion 666 million families. Top 5% families is 83.3 million families world-wide. 

Not really that impressive.

 The problem with your argument is that you are assigning a rare disorder to the larger population. 

That's like saying intelligent people shouldn't have a bias towards them because a small group of them ended up head of a despotic dictatorship. 

The common thread I'm finding here is that you believe bias towards height is unearned and based in genetic phantoms from our African savanna past and that it should be irrelevant. 

I hope you don't like women who have symmetrical faces or slightly wider hips. 




 So again, you're upset because of a slight mass bias towards taller people?

 What's going on? All I'm seeing is their steam profile. 




 "Not talking about height. I spend most of my time talking about heightism."

So you're mad because people believe that height is a marker for better genetics, or ability to take care of a family? Are you also mad at attractive people for being attractive?

 The point is to get people to question what they've been told, why they believe etc. Most people end up believing the religion they grew up in, without truly thinking about what it means. 

And then there are the people who use religion to justify murder, and fuck what those people think. If they want to be irrational asshats, fine, but don't expect me to give any consideration to their feelings. 

What happens when people don't think about what the believe, they become dogmatic and hardliners in getting others to believe, follow, and respect. Extremism begins when you don't allow others to question your beliefs.

Fuck that cheap Eagle bullshit. 




 I know what it's like to go through that at a young age. I'm glad you are better now.

 You don't know me, my background or what I believe towards how business and the state should operate. I haven't derided you in anyway, or inserted personal judgments in my statements. I'm looking at this from a logical point, and you keep trying to belittle me through statements that you have no proof for on top of attributing points of view that I haven't expressed. 

Calm down, just because I don't agree with how this might work out, doesn't mean I am Satan incarnate.  




 Pay attention to the words I am using, not the context you think is there. Think of this as monotone as you can make it.

the tax credit is worth less than the amount they would be applying to student loans.
The company gets a $450 dollar tax credit a year if they spend 1,800 a year paying down an employees debt

The company spends more on paying down student loans, than they would receive in tax credit, which (again) would not encourage hiring of new college grads. This requires businesses to spend more than they receive, which they are not inclined to do.

I think that as a means to an end, it's a bit too complex and likely ineffective. 

Just because it's AN answer doesn't make it the BEST answer.  




 Better than Ron Paul. 




 10th grade learning strategies class. 




 This wouldn't encourage businesses to hire college grads because the tax credit is worth less than the amount they would be applying to student loans. 

the point of this is to pay down the loans not give businesses more money.  




 State Legislatures hold most of the control for tuition rates in state schools, University of Florida, or Michigan State are examples. 

Private and for-profit schools need to have their reigns pulled in though, for sure. 




 Its more of remarking on how stupid it is that helping an individual is frowned upon or worse, but helping business is the best thing in the world. 

The idea that they have to go this far around to help pay down student debt because of appearances is ri-goddamn-diculous.

 Two kinds of people. 




 You're forgetting how much it costs to live. A loaf of bread costs the same for everyone, but it is a larger portion of total income to a poor person. 

There's basically a minimum cost of living if you have a place to live and that cost doesn't necessarily increase the more money you make. If you take 5% of someone making 20k versus 100k, the person making 20k has to make harder choices to cut, as opposed to the 100k person. 

The 100k person can still invest, afford property, play and not have to worry about paying the electric, or rent. the 20k person has much less room to save money, which means they can't take the actions that would allow them to increase their wealth like buying property, investing in retirement or the stock market. 

The point isn't that the person making 2mil doesn't deserve it, the point is that we operate more successfully if more people have the opportunity to make 2 mil.

However, it would really depend on the tribal hospital having a birth record of the grandmother being born to a native. As in on the birth certificate being born to 'this person' who is a tribe member. 

Then the father has to have his birth certificate updated, and then her birth certificate. Its a pain in the ass, and it will take a while, but it can be worth it. 

I'm getting health insurance for $0 co-pay $0 deductible because I have my certificate of native blood. 




 Fucking fascist. 

Sorry, all this lovey, not hating each other stuff felt a little weird. LOL. 




  they are mostly Native.

I don't believe you.

 Some Mexicans do. Some Native Americans are short. But statistically, Native Americans tend to be taller than their Caucasian counterparts. 

Jackass. 




 I get the tone. I just want to make sure we don't repeat mediocrity because someone isn't able to understand sarcasm. 

Also, defending my point because alcohol. 

Take that you fucking Islamic State asshats. 




 "that the experience has taught him to "never give up." "

"Winning Militarily" huh?

The opponent was maybe out-numbered, seriously outgunned and still gaining ground on a strategic level. 

On a just war, no politics level, they were handing us our ass in a war of attrition.

 Oh jesus. Grow a pair you pussy bitch.

 Is that how we explain retreat? Instead of owning up to our mistakes and saying, "Shit."  




 I'm more of asking who has documented blood.  Not that 1/64th on you dad's side bull. 

I just got my certificate. Who here has traceable blood?

 So two different people read into something, a perceived inflection, something that was incorrectly understood and I'm the asshole? 

How does that make sense? 




 See, there's a difference between what I said, and the way you took it. You inferred tone that I didn't have.  




 This is how we get into trouble. 

There is no tone to text, people make up what they feel or want to feel. So I end up sounding like an ass.

 "Any dumbass off the street can do your job." 

OMG. You are so right! What have I been thinking? Any dumbass can talk down a drug addicted parent who is raging up a storm in Child Protective Services. 

Any dumbass can hit someone with a maglight, it takes skill to get someone out of the building without hurting them or yourself. It takes skill to see the slight markers in demeanor or the trace of a weapon under clothing, remaining calm when someone is threatening you with a knife and being able to disarm and subdue them. 

Yeah, any dumbass. 




 That logic fills me with rage. I work as a security guard. There are times where I will literally have to risk my safety. Do you know how much that is worth? 

$8.75 an hour. I am lucky I get that and 40 hours a week because some job sites pay federal minimum wage. ($7.25)

Why don't you find a better job? Motherfucker, when I get off work at 8 in the fucking morning after working 32 hours in a span of 56, it isn't exactly easy to go out and do what I need to do. 

Why don't you just stay up and get stuff done during the day? Because if I sacrifice sleep, I sacrifice my ability to do my job well, and thereby risking my literal fucking life.

As long as it isn't well past a French roast, you can find something to use it in.

 Depending on the govt for subsistence doesn't automatically make people lazy. Why do people not understand this?

~30% of Americans get a Bachelor's degree or higher. Saying that the average voter has a reading comprehension at a high school level isn't even remotely snide.

 Its what I've found that I enjoy. Its cheaper than drinking, more interesting that walking etc, and I can go see new places, new things you wouldn't see normally. Its also the combination of driving and music that let's me slow down my thoughts enough to sort them out. 

There's always just a lot going on. 

And yes, I've tried other thinks like you've suggested.

Its about as rational as liking one soda or another. Just personal taste.

Not actual insanity but super fucking close. 




 The point is to get the platform airtime, and that's exactly what's going to happen. 

And the people who actually study politics knew that from the beginning.  




 Out of all the things you can do, all the ridiculous, insane, beautifully brain damaged things, a flying mod is what makes you want a PC. 




 Shyt nhgga, I hav 3 hole whyskies. 




 It may be because I've had a few whiskeys, but I chuckled. 




 Only narcs call other people narcs. 




 hehhehheHEHHEHheh. hehhehhehHEHHEHHEH. 

HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE. 




 Nah, I haven't seen age of Ultron yet. 




 We don't discriminate. 

But 6ft for a woman is pretty damn tall. 




 Do you think they will remove more, or less content? 




 Found the tattle tale. 




 How high? 




 Hey, its going to be alright. 

Breathe man, breathe. 




 It's from a song. 




 "No matter what a stripper says, there is NO sex in the Champagne room." 




 Fuck a Dominican Chick and you will no longer be boring. 




 See? You've got it.

If you can't win a fight on merit, confuse the fuck out of the other person/being/lackthereof. 




 Holy potato batman! 




 Some type of gray because black and white film. 




 I know jville is largest in land area... 




 STOP USING MY HEADMATES SPECIES AS A JOKE SHITLORD.

Can't/won't we/us all/some just stop/go making/destroying light/dark of iron/ferrite nouns/proper nouns/adjectives/verbs/non-linguists? 




 "I'm alright."

The test determined that was a lie.

*Shrugs shoulders.* 




 Y'all mothafuckers need switchbacks. 




 That ending felt so rushed in the last episode. 

It was like not being able to crap for an hour. You feel it and hold it and you sweat a little and hold it and you clench and waddle and then you get to the restroom and it feels like you can't hold it. You fumble with your belt, oh god is there toilet paper?! You clench waddle to the cabinet, pull down your pants and... Pft. 

That's it.  




 Anti-rape device. 

The one with the needless and shit. 




 Jet fuel is a lot like diesel/kerosene. Regardless, this was a giant office building. There was a bunch of shit in there that would have melted down and burned.  




 Whoever down voted you is a moron. 




 Ohshit. Thanks for reminding me to get one of those number stickers. 




 I'm pretty sure its a joke. 

Then again, the best conspiracies are the ones you think are jokes.  




 I had someone tell me that it was a hoax and their reasoning was that it would have been cheaper to mine the surface of the moon than to send one probe to mars. 

I almost started seizing because I couldn't figure out what he was saying. 




 You could say it would be inefficient. 

Which is just wholly Un-German. 




 Holy shit dude. That's fucked up. 




 Gotta work on your cuts/transitions. 

Made me giggle though. 




 But the stories they could tell...  




 You're paying $5 for the piece of paper, which is itself, useless. It is not like a birth certificate, it is a momento. 




 Take that you dirty little snooguzzler. 




 A spelling error.  




 Oh, I get it. I was just commenting on how few views it has for being a rather well known song. 




 Only 3500 views? 




 No one asked for your opinion, fuckboy. 




 I love crude humor and I would rather be around those who do too, but being alarmed that a lot of people don't share that humor is losing in the special Olympics levels of retarded. 




 I'm progressive and I believe that.  




 I am really disappointed that isn't just a place to go for compliments. 




 /r/im14andiveneverdealtwithadultwomeninanykindofromanticeituationexceptthatonetimeiwentonmyfreecamsandpaidhertosayshelovesme 




 Is that even legal yet? 




 I'd so put it in her pooper. 




 ITT; /u/blackblarneystone left their account logged on and their 12 year old brother found it. 




 Woah. I feel like I missed something. 




 Gunpowder in the twigs, heat the wire with friction, light gunpowder with hot wire. 




 That's like 90% of the way to 1st degree murder. 




 Remember, property is generally considered a good investment. 

Also booze. Lots and lots of booze. 




 The reason they are constantly campaigning is because of the money machine. 

I went to a fundraiser for a State Representative -elect. They hadn't even been in office yet but were fundraising because if they were going to be reelected they needed to start asap.

She was a good rep too. Still lost because of shit messaging from the state and national parties.  




 I am the 94% 




 You aren't wrong, but reddit loves its libertarian spam/bots. 




 You think election season ends? 

Shit's important yo. Would you base a relationship that lasts 4 years and has major impact on your life without trying to get to know the person? 

Plus there's only like 5 elections a decade. It isn't really that hard to stay informed. 




 I thought Benedryl Campervan called them peggins. 




 You aren't understanding what I'm saying, and I don't think I can explain what I mean in a way that will make sense to you. 




 Its a warp field created by bending spacetime. Think of it like the Concorde program. They would have to get out over sea to avoid the sonic boom from breaking windows. And I said given the speed of light. I didn't exclude going faster. 

I'm thinking logistics wise, not unbridled idealism. 




 Given the speed of light it would take a couple of minutes. 

Plus you'd probably not want to bend spacetime anywhere near other people because you have no idea what effect that can have. 




 Clearly I haven't stuck my dick into you. 




 What if the dick being sticked is crazier? 




 Yeah that's how I understood it. Still bull though, you lose most heat through uncovered skin, while that may end up being your face, it doesn't dissipate heat any more rapidly than the rest of you. 




 So are we just going to ignore the white fedora..?  




 So many fingerprints. 




 I don't play lol. 




 And here I was thinking it was more like "It belongs in a museum" brand of scientific pure-ism.  









 Why not eleven/eleven/eleven-eleven? 




 And the people who eat Mounds are crazy. 




 What's more helpful to the general populous? 

Here's a thought. 

EDUCATE THEM. If the general population is so scientifically illiterate it is literally killing them, perhaps we should focus on educating our children instead of teaching them even shittier non-science. 




  you don't necessarily realize the amount of sodium, sweeteners, etc.... that go into it. 

Stick to the serving size and you should be fine. Of course you shouldn't eat 2000 calories of beef jerky because that's like 10x the amount of sodium you should have. 

Processed food is fine as long as you don't eat too much. I.E. More than 2000 calories a day. 




 In general, typically...? I would hold their weight the same. 

People think refined foods are worse because it is easier to over indulge. Refined sugar is no more dangerous *in the appropriate amount* than say pure cane or beet sugar. Adding stabilizers and preservatives does not decrease the healthy-ness of food. Sure it can make the quality crap. It'll taste different, but it is not one the whole more or less healthy than, say, organic alternatives. 




 And then there is anti-science bullshit. 

If someone wants to say that you shouldn't things that you can't pronounce, I'm going to poke the hole in that seriously flawed logic. Saying things are bad because you don't understand them is pretty much the same thing as xenophobia. 




 It ain't easy being cheesy. 




 The retardation is strong with this one. 




 Its copy-pasta. 




 So you're the asshole who shows up to Chuckie Cheese and calls the kids 'filthy casuals.' 
























 Except for the fact that most rail lines (let's just go with in the US because you're probably from here anyway) are publicly owned ventures and in order to upgrade these systems they would need to raise fares, maybe taxes, incur construction delays, and all of the things that are really unpopular and cause more uproar than a derailment. Not to mention its cheaper to pay out a settlement than all the upgrades necessary.

But yeah, no its those damn unions. 




 EMOTIONAL masochist. Not physical. 




 Neither. Drinking and celebrating. 




 East Tennessee man, strippers bathe themselves in oxy, not glitter. 









 So was the History Channel like five years ahead of this?  




 I know. Only one person left until the secret belongs to me. 




 It would be like... An entire planet thats a computer. 




 You can, but you're gonna get zero. 




 I get it if you are a new player, but when the majority of these end up being something like "should I go for the luxury with 2 hills and a sheep or the luxury with 3 forests and slightly closer to my capitol?"

Make your own damn decision. Or settle both, I really, REALLY don't care. 




 Yeah man, 300 if you re use you old keyboard and case.  




 No. 




 Its in St Augustine Florida. Go forth and fall into tourist traps. 




 What's the map size and how many civs are playing? 




 Born here, learned to talk there, college here, work here, work there. 

Yes, totally just British. 




 I think you, Leslie Neilson and I are the only ones who remember that disaster. 




 The point of the statement is that the stated scenario is bs in part because of how the 7 uses a line to increase its worth.  




 She's from Chicago (according to Wikipedia.) 




 Basically tally marks would have the same effect and be a more natural solution. 




 Well, at least I have no idea what the fuck they are talking about. 




 Probably a franchise anyway. 




 1, what population density is it OK to change the governmental structure, 2, there are different means to maintain a democracy while changing out who is the government. Its a different group of people with some different rules, not a dictatorship.

Yeah, it might not be a popular move, then again, it might. 




 They could give up governmental control. Maybe not just giving the land as title and ownership, but facilitation of the land they could. 




 Quantum Mechanics is how the universe is trolling us. 




 I'm guessing you missed the second and third matrix movies. 




 That was kind of the point. Jack Abramoff couldn't deliver, so a movie about him shouldn't either. 




 Its so cool. 




 I know exactly what I'm thinking of. I'm thinking of all the engineers in my family and the ones I've worked with over the years. 




 You've never met an engineer have you? 

Oh yeah, summerreddit. 




 Engineer is far more likely. 




 Airplanes? AIRPLANES?! Have you heard of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_disasters_by_death_toll#Aviation?

/that's why 




 Found the engineer. 




 Yeah probably. Then again, maybe we should be with people who like us for us and not try to force a height thing. 




 I don't think you realize how big this continent is. 




 True Lies isn't that bad. 




 You see an Arab man on a motorcycle being chased through a luxury hotel by Shawrzengerblicher on a horse. What do you do? 




 Yes, but with stacks of paper and some people call it data entry. 




 It would be nice. 




 What if we took all the tall men who aren't getting laid and all the tall women who aren't getting laid and put them in the same place?  




 Capitals are generally the higher population cities. They get the bonuses from city-states first and if you are going tradition, it'll will receive extra growth. 

Plus you've got a testy neighbor close to your second city. 




 It depends on the context. Like, if I'm pumping gas or on a smoke break, don't expect me to be super chatty. If I'm at the bar or something, sure I've probably drunk enough to be social. 




 Nah, pretty much on par with regular reddit. 




 Yeah, fuck corporate OP. 




 This makes me sad. 




 We got burnt out on him playing like 4 roles in the same movie. 




 The hands of fate certainly seem tied. 




 Do people who wear different clothes on different days also confuse you? 




 Like Black Jason Statham or Cancer Patient Matt Damon. 

But last night, I saw Male Janeane Garofalo with ironic trucker hat accessory.  




 Yep. 




 So, censorship is an active attempt to stop you from expressing your views, which is different than refusing to provide the forum to express it. Especially when you consider that this site is the equivalent to private property, if you kick the shrubs and dig up the grass, they have the right to ask you to leave. 

This new era of butthurt is really going to screw us up for a long time. I don't have a dog in many fights, I just watch and try to maintain a logical standpoint. 

*But seriously, this is getting pretty regoddamndiculous.* 




 Gross. 









 Holy shit, scout better to start.  




 DUDE. FUCKING SPOILERS. 




 Not exactly what I think of when 'eating talls' is mentioned.  




 I have pockets. 

Oh and its the freaking dollar store, no one gives a shit except for the autistic guy who does some stocking. 




 Different game styles.  




 And the panels you buy might even work for an entire summer! 




 I know. 




 Make sure it doesn't do anything else, eye injuries are bad news. 




 Florida originally, Tennessee now. I'm taller and bigger than most people, but I haven't felt afraid of people. And I have been in some stupid situations. 




 Damn son. Did you get it checked out?  




 I come across guys who are taller than me pretty regularly and I've never felt that fear. And I've met guys 5 inches and 200 pounds heavier than me. 

Maybe I'm broken or something? 




 Yeah. There are some really retarded people in the drug trade. 




 Its mee-mee. So dank.  




 I just can't wait for the headline: 

Nebraska man murders 11 in Death Penalty repeal protest, Receives life in prison. 




 Well, all they'd get is dick pics, but any half assed lawyer can get shit thrown out if no warrant is awarded. 




 So brave. 




 That's why you put a lock on the phone and refuse to give them the pass code without a warrant. 




 Says the white person. Check your privilege. 

Oh wait, this isn't TiA. 




 Great asses aren't made by just fat, they have to have a solid foundation. The jiggly bit is the icing, and no one wants a cake made of just icing, its kinda gross. 




 That's a stretch. 

Selling cigarettes doesn't give you lung cancer and he was cooking in an RV, not a van. 




 Yeah, but I want to smoke them. 




 What? 




 Nah, its cool. I look like a middle class white dude. 




 Sell one cigarette in the club, everybody fucking wants one. 




 ITT; people who have never worked in a bar.  




 Pretty sure the more creative the map is on info and representation, the more relaxed the standards. 

Beautiful AF + close enough = Top of page. 




 :| 




 It's still a bunch of really ridiculous shit though. 




 Don't know til you try. 




 When you browse on mobile with an app, you click a YouTube link and it will sometimes ask if you want to watch it on chrome, browser, or you tube app. 




 Every Filipino guy has a crush =\= everyone who has a crush is a Filipino guy. 




 Well, when you believe that after death is eternal happiness in a freaking paradise, its not so much suffering. 




 The point of the 144k is that they would be like judges and princes in heaven. 

No giant condominium in the sky. Jehovah's Witnesses, not South Florida Jews. 




 Well yeah, that's the sound it would make. 




 Cool. So hopefully no super glowing-Capuchin-overlord  experiments. 




 The shunning is really the biggest thing. They tend to be stuck in the 50's morality-wise, knee length skirts, supervised courtship, etc. So nothing like Scientology crazy. 

By and large the just cutting off immediate family members entirely, like my mom did to my brother, her own son. Literally nothing more than 'Hello.' 




 They believe that all those who aren't chosen to go to heaven will inhabit a paradise like earth to live as Jehovah had intended for Adam and Eve to do. 

Its like a really nice second place prize. 




 I really hope he doesn't become a stock broker. 




 Rolled with the punctures.* 




 If this person didn't make something of their life, I will be disappointed.  




 "Freckles" ... Oh honey... 




 Former bouncer, currently uniformed security for an office building. 




 So a 12 year old libertarian with a Masters of Fedora from redpill? 




 You can smoke without being a fucktard, and you can be a fucktard without smoking. 

He probably would have stolen it and done something else with the money anyway.  




 Some people sleep heavy, or beer and a benedryl, sleep aides.  




 That's why we have things like involuntary manslaughter charges. 

But the biggest point here is: did intentional actions directly lead to this person's death?  




 OK, fine. You want to be a smartass. I'm game.

Did you intent to cut the person? If you did that would be a felony. Did the resulting injuries cause the person's death? Well shit I guess it did.

If you intentionally injure someone and the end result is their death, YES SMARTASS, THAT'S FUCKING MURDER. 

There is no 'its just a prank bro' if someone fucking dies. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. 




 Yes, because the end result is a death.

That's what matters the most here.  




 At least it didn't smell like drop. 




 I'm just here for the popcorn.gif 

This thread is amazing. 




 I got out before all that, so I don't know what dating was like. It also didn't cross my mind. 

Holy shit, that must have been a nightmare. 




 Not even Finnish metal is this fucking hardcore. 




 I'm surprised you reddit. Myspace/Facebook were banned in my district for a long time. 




 You missed the point. 

If the kid dies without taking the blood, he gets to heaven situation. If you give him the blood, he lives, but loses out on the life in heaven. 

Heaven  earth (given that it exists.)  




 The funniest thing about all this is that I grew up JW and this was a very real situation for me. At any point in time I could have been in a car accident and I'd have been FUCKED. 

We don't let children make medical or legal decisions, for good reason, they generally don't have the critical thinking skills to make the best choice. So parents make the decision. Yeah, its a shit decision, but legally speaking, they are the ones who have the final say. 

I'm not a JW, and I have no intention to be, but if you want to be the one to take a shit all over the constitution, just try.
