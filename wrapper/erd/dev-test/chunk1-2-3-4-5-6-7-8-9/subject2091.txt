 The problem is that whichever war we are at, it does not determine who is right, but only who is left.
 




 That is just amazing! I'd frame it and put a red paper for background - I think this looks better than most art. 














 sausages 




 Interesting that we could protect against UV radiation with the pill, but that poses another question - how would that effect our kidney or liver?

 Pigeon 














 Don't know why, but this looks like dog pickup pose and it's working on me as well :S weird. 






















































 Good luck with detection - hope you will be accurate and precise. 




















































































 I wonder if this could also be "hacked" wirelessly to induce overdosage and thus causing further problems or even death? A new way to attack? Great article! 

































































































































 If you don't have any genetic eye disorders or diseases you could try some exercises to strenghten your eye muscles which in result will help with better focus and vision.

My friend has a Stargardt's Disease ( which only affects like 1:100000) and currently there is no known cure as even glasses can't help. 




 20/70 to 20/160 : is considered moderate visual impairment, or moderate low vision

20/200 to 20/400 : is considered severe visual impairment, or severe low vision 




 It's great things are starting to move in this area as we are forgotting that estimates for blind people exceed 39 million worldwide and more than 246 million have some kind of severe or moderate visual impairment. This is probably one of the worst impairments a person can have. 






















































 You are right about range limit, but still as you said some preventive methods should be taken in account - better safe than sorry.

 Yes we'll get a lot more pictures at even higher resolutions, but due to the limit of how much data can be sent each second this will take a few months (we'll get a few more on Friday). 




 I know that this is impossible, but just for a second imagine if all of those dollars that go in to the war would be put in advancing space explorations and technology how many more of these spectuacular days we'd had - I for one much rather would look at pictures of this kind than pictures of people getting blown in to pieces or gunned down.  




 There are craters on Pluto, but the area that was shown shows that there are still geological processes going on Pluto even after such a long time. 




 That would require a tremendous amounts of fuel and I don't know if we could do it in "real-time" to manouever it. 




  This device is about 500 times thinner than a human hair. 








































































































 The article says that it is effective, not a cure, although imo cancer is still one of the most profitable businesses so let's just hope that one day there will be an universal cure and not just something like monthly TV subscription eg. having someone on a hook just so pharma companies can squeeze as much as they can from one patient till he dies. 









 I wonder when we'll have ads appear on contact lenses else you won't be able to see or implanted in brains for crist sake ... 


































 Probably blue holes, they shit out every shit that gets sucked in black hole.
