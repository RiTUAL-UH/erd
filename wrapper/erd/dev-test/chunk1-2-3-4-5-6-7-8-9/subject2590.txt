 Q: What do you call a cheap circumcision? 
A: A rip off. 
Only ever get groans of disgust lol 




 Took me 8 reads to realize there was nothing wrong with it. You rotten redditers  




 I read that as "and it was the highlight of my life" 
I really need to read more carefully when I'm on reddit...  




 I recently hit that age where I'm doing it twice a week, aflush with cash, and confident in life and my assertions of right and wrong (lol let's see how long that lasts). Still living with my Parents (both of whom are undergoing serious midlife-crises). Life is good :)

Well good! I'd far prefer for abused people to grow up and become happy and productive members of society. Unfortunately for me, I'm stuck with my asshole of a cousin who, for some unfathomable reason, has decided she doesn't want to fit in with the demographic that you so eloquently pointed out exists. Imagine that.  




 But you're not *just* a cum bucket. You're a cum bucket filled with nerves who just said that it feels great.  




 *little boy walks in. Sees grown man laying on floor with pants around ankles urinating straight into the air. Little boy walks out* 




 Nearly every major pc game that has come out after 2014 is unplayable unless you have an $800+ computer. I mean, I can turn down the graphics and visual settings pretty dang far, but when you're playing with the same resolution as an ipod touch things are just a little bit ridiculous.  




 I know one abused girl. She is a huge asshole. She also happens to be my cousin and lives with me. 
I dunno where you got your info but from personal experience abused people are jerks. Everyone always says "you don't know what she went through" but I mean c'mon, it was for like a year when she was 6. That's no excuse to be an ass.  




 Wait but you just said sex feels great. If you believe that it feels great, why are you not doing it?  




 Yes they are

 Would you rather watch porn of your parents or with your parents?  




 Oh from chat roulette?  




 I'd have Miley Cyrus stop singing and start doing por- 
Wait a second...  




 Oh you poor thing  




 That's true. You've got that going for you. Reddit loves you 3

 Legion:Skin deep by Brandon Sanderson is a fantasy novel that explores this idea. It's about 100 pages long and is an entertaining yet interesting read  




 I literally cannot stop laughing at that edit lol I'm dying Oh God reddit is killing me  




 Post a really clever and funny comment  




 Yeah sorry buddy. That's just a tad weird  




 Sorry in advance buuuuuttttttt he sounds like a dick. (I'm a guy btw) You make it sound like you're trying and you want to be great for him, and he is just using you as a hole for sex. The fact that he "doesn't talk during sex" really shouldn't be an excuse for why he isn't helping you build your confidence. Now I realize that telling you this isn't going to help at all, it isn't really constructive. This is just feedback and my opinion on what I'm noticing from your post. I would suggest working out. Many people that I know who had similar problems with confidence found themselves growing more comfortable with their bodies and abilities as lovers when they exercise frequently. Honestly sex feels great. I have sex all the time and it doesn't really matter what she does, it always feels nice. If she does a little extra stuff that feels cool too, but almost no matter what you do he will enjoy it and like it a lot. Don't freak out about it :)

 Fucking vaccinate your kids. Smallpox is coming back in some parts of the world because people are refusing to vaccinate their kids for religious reasons or because they think it's linked to autism. This is a disease that killed off nearly the entire population of Native Americans because they had no resistance to it. Know who else has no resistance to it? 21st century citizens of the united states. Get them vaccines peeps 




 I read that as 5,120,000 years ago... Was gonna say that making a joke about how old teachers were isn't [serious]

 At least you're honest 




 Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God. How does this not have 10,000 up votes yet  




 That's the most important thing. I'm glad you've been able to stay away from all those other things that people lose themselves in. Keep going man :) one day at a time  




 Don't worry. I'm always supportive of you.  




 Oh mother of God that was terrible I am so sorry  




 Fuck. I just posted that. Didn't see this. Damn. Fuck. Damn.  




 "So yes. It had flaws, but what does that matter when it comes to matters of the heart? We love what we love. Reason does not enter into it. In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing *because*. That's as easy as putting a penny In your pocket. But to love something *despite*. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect." 




 That's true. After a nuclear apocalypse people probably wouldn't care too much anymore  




 Except for the religious Christian folk  




 A woman's hands say a lot about how she feels. For example, if she's pointing a gun at you then she's probably angry.  




 You're toast  




 Up vote just for the edit  




 I still remember all the cheat codes from it XD 




 If you and a girl are adjacent and she uses her non-dominant hand to do something such as scratch her nose or pick something up but leaves her dominant hand down and at her side (adjacent to your hand), it usually means she wants to hold hands with you. 
And yes, that is grammatically correct. It just sounds ridiculously run-onny 




 They took away my books...  




 Don't believe in yourself. Believe in the me that believes in you.  




 That's all that really matters 




 A blink is actually twice as sexy as a wink. Because you're closing TWO eyes instead of just one  




 Whenever she is thinking hard she will stick out her tongue the tiniest bit. And she has a really tiny tongue and she just sorta wiggles it around. She doesn't even know she does it. I pointed it out one time and she didn't believe me.  




 I probably laughed for a good 3 minutes at this  




 I laughed more from this than the parent comment  
























 The motherfucking BMW that that asshole in front of me is driving.  




 Selfie actually means something though. That's like saying "I wish people would stop saying the word 'rap'". Rap is a word that describes a genre of music. Selfie is a word that describes a type of picture. It's not some stupid buzzword that people are throwing around. It actually means something.  




 I work at a fast food restaurant as a cashier. When people come up to the counter and say "gimme a double double. Gimme some fries. Gimme a chocolate shake." I want to PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE. The word "gimme" is the epitome of rudeness as far as "words to request something" go. Just because I work in a fast food restaurant doesn't mean you need to be a total dick, dick.  




 As a 17 year old camp councilor, I can tell you that that is an excellent idea and will doubtlessly get you laid. Nothing turns a woman on more than hearing that you sometimes volunteer at summer camps.  




 It's okay. You're not too smart.  




 Sounds like your memory isn't too great  




 I'm curious about how to take off a shirt and bra in one move. Sound like a useful trick 




 *badly 




 Would've had a warning too  




 I think the girl on coke is funnier..

 In California gas stations are required by law to have free air pumps for public use. They can't have any strings attached either like forcing you to buy an item. Anyone can cuz em for free :)

 I was going to say magic tricks too! But that's because in high school I thought it would be fun to learn how to do them and I've seen almost all the good card tricks already :( so they have lost their wonder for me  




 I giggled.  




 I know the roach is probably more terrified of me than I am of it

Let's be real here. Roaches fear nothing  




 I have a fear that if I eat hot food and then drink a cold beverage right after my teeth will shatter. Like a hot mug that gets ice water poured into it. Scares the crap outta me. Also makes it a real bitch to eat hot food.  




 Don't know if this counts cuz it was technically the blurb, but Elantris by Brandon Sanderson. Easily the best blurb I've ever read in my entire life.  




 I get my books almost exclusively from my county library. All the books there have dust jackets. I grew up loving dust-jacketed books and I will die loving dust-jacketed books.

 So I have 750 hours of not fun on my skyrim save? (and no life)  









 *nacho lucky day  














 Lmao 




 But the whole point is that it's offensive. Although I guess it does kind of go past offensive into tasteless... 




 That's why he said "but I'm not mean about it" 
He would say something tactful. Like "it looks very very very bad"  




 Ah. You must be white.

 Thanks! I tried looking for it but couldn't remember who made it :( 
Definitely wasn't trying to get credit for this hilarious picture, just wanted to spread some smiles!  




 Or I can wait 10 minutes for a half a dozen people to comment the link over and over again.

 Damn. There goes my dream of being the next subway icon  




 It's heroes like you who make reading fun. Thank you, sir, for your noble sacrifice.  




 It's okay. I am white.  




 He'd be so distracted with how that joke makes no sense you could nail him right between the eyes.  




 Hehe. Shot. 

 




 He laughs so hard he drops the gun and you shoot him with it. Impressive turn of events.  




 Nope. That's only to impress a chick.  




 I'm no longer alone!

 I'd rather be gilded than gelded 




 Shit you not my little brother said that exact thing to me earlier today  




 Or not really care about math class

 They don't have the manners of Canadians, that's why.  




 I hiked kokohead crater in flip-flops earlier this summer. My mom refused to tell me what it was. She just said "some people can do it in under 20 minutes" when I asked her how long it was. Little did I know she was referring to Olympic athletes and triathletes trying to get in shape. It didn't go over too well 




 I went on a cruise to Alaska one summer. One of the other passengers, a girl in her early 20's, packed only bikinis, short shorts, and tank tops. One of the landing party tour guides asked her why she didn't pack more warmly. She said it was because the weather channel always shows Hawaii and Alaska right next to each other. I gave up on the human race right then.  




 You sure it wasn't jesus?

 See, I appreciated the first person telling me this. Because I honestly had no idea who made it. But you are now the 8th person to say it and give the link. There are 47 *other* people here who have mentioned it's a repost. Yes. I get it. It is a repost. Thank you for telling me 55 times.  









 I feel like I'd prefer that.  




 I'll give you rice if you find the link  




 Woah I didn't know that. Thanks! This discovery will probably cut down comments on my pictures by about 85% 









 I feel like the entirety of comments on this page are either about people complaining it's a repost, or saying they don't mind the fact that it's a repost.  




 I don't get the title. But it's metal as fuck.  
























 If only there were already a comment here where I said what the difference was. If only if only.  




 Huh. Where I come from there's a strong difference. Redheads can have darker skin tones. The only requirement to being a redhead is having red hair. Ginger is a subcategory found within the redhead group. Gingers have pale skin, freckles, and very very red hair. They sunburn easily and have no souls.

The Allied powers in World War 2 tried to put female hormones in Hitler's food in order to make him more feminine and less capable of leading a war. (looks like they were more sexist back then too) 

Because whales are so large, sometimes a third whale needs to swim underneath two copulating whales to hold them afloat and keep them from sinking. 

Whales are also scientifically proven to be the best wingmen.  




 Because all objects accelerate downward at a constant speed of 9.8 m/s, any animal dropped out of a helicopter would fall at the same speed as the cow. Because a smaller object would have marginally less air resistance, it would fall faster. Therefore, due to physics, a frog dropped out of a helicopter would be faster than a cow.
