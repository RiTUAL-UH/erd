 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the NAvy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top snuper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with my precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak, I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't and now you're paying the price you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead,

 I was just wondering what would happen if an angel and a demon had a child never said that's what was happening in the show that's why I used the words "what if" and "maybe"just some outside the box thinking that's all. 





























 Why do I feel alone even when surrounded by family and friends? I have been diagnosed with sever depression and anxiety but honestly who hasn't these days.i feel like I have no one I feel like my friends just talk to me to be nice but honestly they could care less and I know I love my family and they love me but damn, I just feel emotionless and alone. 



















 Somedays are good some are not...I feel like a complete failure to my family I can't even do school right I can't even start my day right I feel like anything I do is wrong and I feel alone sure I have people I talk to at school that call me their friend but I still feel alone I have no one close no one to share this with and it eats me up inside, I'm 16 and my life feels like a huge mistake like it was never meant to be I'm only 16 why me why ?
I just want to feel happy I just want this to stop I just want to feel normal again I want to have a day where I don't feel like a total screwup, at my school i put on the mask of a kid who cares for others but on the inside I don't care for myself sure I might have a smile all day but it's not real and frankly I'm to good at it.

 Ok 




 Thanks! 



















 Thanks 




 Ok I see it now, should be an easy fix 









 That's rude,good or not I still put time into it and I am still striving to improve. Art is like driving, some go faster than others. So thank you for the motivation to improve your the reason my arts just going to get better. 




 Thanks:)

 I guess  




 I don't want to put that stress on them though. 




 I'm just getting bad again I don't want to tell my family cause I feel like a burden for how many times Iv had a relapse of sadness and I just don't want them to know I'd rather have them think I'm ok.i don't feel suicidal at all, I feel so alone I feel like iv got no one the only people I really talk to is my family. 
























 Those were werewolves. 









 Thanks! 
























 No problem  




 You know what else is rude ...reality  









 Touché I'm still learning and your advice really opened my eyes. 




 But I do get what your saying 




 The picture next to it was just there from when I was working on it, no intentions of side by side. 














 If you look close there is a piece of wood in his hand and if you look at the far right there is a fire so could be someone op knows.

 Oh, well that sucks? 









 This brought a smile to my face that's been missing for a while. Thank you :)  




 Iv noticed that when my depression gets bad my drawings tend to, well really suck and I wanted to know if that's just me or does anyone else experience that. My art teacher said she saw major improvement in my drawing/drawings in the last semester and a half.  




 That's awesome !! 




 Trippy I like it! 




 You have some good there!  




 The face seems a bit small but great job you can only get better from here with practice and hard work 




 That's pretty cool !! 




 Good work ! Keep up the progress ! 




 The hamster dance scene gets me every time thanks for posting this!. 




 But I can see the confusion I'm happy I lost 10lbs 




 I think you posted to the wrong post in trying to lose weight not gain it 




 Lost 10 lbs anyway to keep the motivation? How do you motivate yourself? How do you deal with the people that mock you? 




 Also ways I fixed my diet was... 

*lunch I have loads of fruit, gives me some of that natural energy to push me through the rest of the day.

*morning is my protein based meal like egg whites ,peanut butter on whole wheat

*dinner is more of my veggies mostly green one which are the one I like the most haha maybe a portion of chicken or lean stake (size of your palm).

*snacks I mainly just eat fruits maybe some string cheese, low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt.
 




 Yeah that's the hardest part being healthy is 80% nutrition and 20% fitness .Well if you ever need to talk just pm me  




 Alright, Alright, Alright 




 That's what I thought when I first heard about it but I gave it a try just to see what it was all about and iv just been getting good results and setting new goals.The shakes are basically a Healthy meal replacement. 




 That shit is the best !!! (Melatonin) 




 Don't start all at once and over whelm yourself. At first make little changes like for example have a salad for lunch or start walking everyday even something as simple as drinking 8 cups of water a day. 




 Iv lost 10 lbs using those herbalife shakes and exercising regularly. And just wanted to know if anyone else got good results from herbalife. 




 I am not try to do anything though like seriously I lost 10 lbs using herbalife and got good results just wanted to see if others did to, no need to be so aggressive. 




 I have no idea 




 I'm actually down 10 lbs using it. 




 Just interested if anyone does and how you like their products or not? 




 It's a joke as to say the teacher was teaching them wrong so the grammars wron ... Turn it down a notch  




 I'm pretty sure saying diagnosed with depression is the right way to put it since it's a mental illness/mental disease same as anxiety. 




 You need to work on proportions Im saying this in the nicest way possible. But looks good keep up the good work you can only get better! 




 Love the emotion in his face !! 




 Thanks 




 Just get out more don't seclude yourself to one are by yourself it no good for you I know from experience. 




 It also says to reveal then it says that part so maybe 




 Neat ! 









 I don't want to make it just like the picture gotta have some diversity.but I see what you're saying 




 [Here](http://i.imgur.com/7wlOfs5l.jpg) it is but I think I just need to make the eyebrows more pronounced  




 Haha 




 Derek is the only one who looks awesome as a full on werewolf like for [example] (http://i.imgur.com/4DKq8Vv.png) 




 Thanks and I'll try the eyes thing,cause I'm redoing it on better paper ment for drawing. 









 I later realized that  




 I know right! 









 Except for the fact that's when stiles had the buzz cut  














 Haha she is a babe 




 Kanima is a red election of who you are on the inside  




 Oh yeah  




 I see what your saying now 




 Derek fought it away   




 He feeds off that so if that was the case that would make no sense  




 That was the kanima  




 Looks like she's going to go after hunters 




 Which proportions are off just wondering  




 But I like the were jaguar thing more but how do u become a jaguar from being turned from a wolf  




 She could be jokeing as to what she looks like as it. And a like i said in the post "though later legend and folklore depicts revenants as returning for a specific purpose (e.g., revenge against the deceased's killer)" so that might be the reason she came back as a revenant/were-jaguar  




 That was for like full body drawings though 




 I'm confused on what you mean by gesture ? 




 You never know. And if your throat was slit it would take a matter of seconds to die so I don't think the wolf healing ability works that fast. 




 You never know. 









 But berzerkers are just pure savage nature no thought process at all (that's what mr.argent said) 




 His eyes are suppose to have dark rings  




 I think that was the nogitsune playing tricks. Or it was because they had the doors to their minds open and it think they closed them 




 (Kate)
she's a werewolf but she is also A revenant(is a visible ghost or animated corpse that was believed to return from the grave to terrorize the living.)Though later legend and folklore depicts revenants as returning for a specific purpose (e.g., revenge against the deceased's killer)...Peter? Any thoughts? 
























 I'll get to it 




 I'll get to it 




 Just watch the episode most of them ran, not all monsters are bad. 




 But does evolution apply to the supernatural world?  




 Most of the monsters ran they didn't stay and fight  




 Based on most of your comments, you could attract the positive end of a magnet 




 Sorry 17 














 Oh I will get one just wait

 Once I saw the clawed guy I was like deans going to mention Freddy Kruger  




 I liked bloodlines and stand behind it same as Jared and Misha. I feel like they could do allot with it, but the one thing I didn't like was the main hunter character kind of looked like drake but he was interesting and I felt he played his character well this is just my opinion and everyone has their own. 




 I really liked this episode and could stand behind this spin off I think it's going to be a success. 




 I liked it !  




 Probably a stupid question but how do you get those supernatural qoutes by your username when you comment?

 It's my mom though  




 I don't want to drop it but when people (family) say I'm just being lazy, you're a low life and stuff like that. My dad and brother are the only ones who believe my depression is real.i start to believe the things they say and think wtf is the point of high school if I'm not going to amount to anything. 
























 He's from space Dicks so it all makes sense now  




 And most of the rock and music today sucks allot  




 Green day sucks dean would defiantly not approve and yes it is whiny  




 To clarify I think dean would hate this shit I was just jokeing with the title any ways deans more classic rock (actual good music that's far better than any crap today) type of guy. 




 Someone got that it was a joke dean would never listen to that shit classic rock forever! 




 I wasn't being serious I just couldn't think of a title lol but true deans more of a classic rock type of guy the good stuff  









 It says spoilers in the title  




 So was the blade slowly taking deans soul away and then dying kind of completed the process ? Cause Cain said there is a price with the mark  (a soul?) can someone clarify . 




 He didn't call it, he lived it. 









 Looks like dean has a [dark passenger](http://i.imgur.com/JZ0uQsz.jpg) 




 It's from being away from the blade  




 No surprise new Gods a dick . 




 I think he will become some sort of angel  




 True very true 




 I think for the finally deans going to kill himself while taking Metatron with him because he realizes the mark of Cain is too strong and this season kind of emphasized on how dean only saves sam so he's not alone and not just for Sam's well being so I think he will use the last blade to kill Metatron of course then stab himself so he can hurt anyone else in his blind rage and the way he comes back in season 10 is he becomes an angel or Crowley will save him(since he has human emotion now) if only the boys promise not to gank his ass. 


Just a though not saying it's going to happen.


Also share what you think I'm interested to hear about it! 














 But that's only happened like 2 in spn  




 Touché  




 What do you like most about your job? 




 I'll have to try and find them haha 




 Thank you for sharing and I'm really excited now haha!! 




 Hahaha sorry? 




 We love you though :)  




 Has anyone ever been to a con was it costly?
 Was it worth it?
Was it what you expected?
 I was thinking about going to the con in Minnesota but just getting photo op tickets with Jared and Jensen and then a 1 day pass.   




 Why would it matter if you are heterosexual or not? 




 Got it from an Instagram account  




 I was going to go with that as my title haha 









 Oh ok 




 Dude! Asia . 




 "Come on bobby, lets go hunting" 









 I think bloodlines has some potential. 




 I want this to happen 














 That video was during shooting an episode so most likely  









 That too 




 This songs a bit over used but when ever I hear it I think supernatural maybe it's because the original is in season 6 
http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l2S4GTD-AAw 




 No 




 I happy to hear that haha  









 Really?!?! I thought there has been 23 so far either way it's gonna suck when the season ends 




 I don't think I'll be able to contain myself when carry on my wayward son starts on Tuesday I'm not ready for this finale and its suppose to be a cliff hanger like a certain season that involved 'pac men' as dean called them . Anyone else not ready? 




 It was the heat of the moment ! 




 Thanks for sharing I love it!! 




 Wasn't trying to appeal to anyone just thought it would be a cool ending 




 Yeah the second one would be depressing  




 Why not? Haha 




 There was a whole episode about it lol 




 Was just thinking of ways the show could  end, would love to hear others ideas too.
 

Ok so dean and sam are in motel after ganking the last evil s.o.b main antagonist of whatever season it is
 
They both go to bed 
 
(Shot of just sams face as he's asleep ) *radio turns on* "it was heat of the moment" Sams eyes open , "RISE AND SHINE SAMMY!" *Goes to black*.

 I liked it  









 None taken haha 




 I didn't make it lol 




 Dean would probably say it's not the same or that's just wrong haha 














 My advice for you is to downvote and move on like I said before you can attract the positive end of a magnet  and there is no need to be a mega-douche I'm expressing how I felt about the new spin off and what I though about it so sorry for being a human being and p.s. Have a nice day :)! 




 Thanks and my bestfriends name is sam he's a little behind on spn but  every Tuesday I call him and say that  




 There haha 




 And dean and sam are always surprised by new characteristics from monsters all the time. 




 I meant supernatural as in the unexplained, magic and monsters  




 You could have said anything! 
























 Using marijuana  




 The stuff I'm getting is called sour diesel I don't know if that matters or not but what are some tips for my first time? 




 Thanks and it's not finished it's still work in progress  
























 Thanks I will defiantly try that I just want to test a few things before I start  




 I'm doing my first cosplay/gender bend cosplay as Ashe from league of legends
And I am hand making the bow I wanted to do a card board frame and wire then paper mâché the outside then sand the out side smooth then paint is this a posable method ?  




 Not a save, just stating facts. 









 Yeah but he's got them moves like a jaguar  









 Hi 




 Thanks :) 




 I was just getting done with my shift at around 6:30pm at the summer boys camp. The forecast called for rain and by looking at the sky that forecast would soon come true, so I made my way to my old rusty ford pinto as I put the key in the ignition it took 5 or 6 tries to get it to turn over. I was just 40 min outside of the city when the rain hit like wall, my car started to slowly decelerate as I notice my check engine light was on "you gotta be f@$ ing kidding me!". I looked to see if there are any incoming cars to help but in the distance I saw an old rundown house but it wasn't abandoned there was a light on inside, so I quickly grabbed my umbrella wedged in the bottom of my seat and make my way to the front door.
    
   I knock 3 times, the door slowly opens with an eerie squeak you only hear in the movies to reveal an elderly man who could well be in his late hundreds a beard down to his stomach whiter then mountain snow and bald scalp.
  "May I help you" he asked
    
    "Yes my car broke down just down the road, would I be able to make a call?"
  
 The old mans face was blank 

 "Sorry son,no phone here"
    
  "Well may I stay until the rain stops?"
 
"Sure you can !"the old man seemed delighted as if I was the first person he's seen in 10 years.
   He gave me a tour of his house but oddly enough kind of like the tardis it was crappy on the outside but beautiful on the inside. I noticed a door he seemed to miss as we walked by I asked "what is in here"

 The old man turned around with lightning speed as if he was 20 again 
 
"Do not touch what's in there!"
He slammed the door that was not even an inch open and pulled a key from the wall and locked the door.
 
"I'm sorry"
Well finally sat down in the dinning room and the man grabbed me a soda. As we were talking waiting for the rain to stop the old man slowly began to drift off as I was telling him about my job. After he was asleep I got very curious I wan to know what's in that room, so I slowly get up and make my way to the locked door I grab the key off the wall I slowly start to unlock the door but as I open the door I hear in the back of my mind "don't touch what's in there".
    I open the door to find a stairwell leading to a basement I start making my way down the old creaky stairs surprised they can hold my weight. I look over to see in the corner of the room a 20x15ft steel cage but that's not what shocked me what shocked me was the 750lbs silver back gorilla sitting favoring the wall 4 ft in front of the cage door I slowly approach the cage and again in my mind I hear "don't touch what's down there" but all I can think about is why is this animal here. I try to make the gorilla move so I say "hey!" But no response it was as if it was a realistic statue I went to the side of the cage to get a view of its face and it just had a blank stare not even a blink.i noticed another key on the wall by the cage so I took the key I slowly opened the cage door and reached ever so slightly towards the gorilla my pointer finger just barely grazed it's fur when the gorilla erupted with a loud yell I feel back and ran up the stairs and bolted out of the house.

 Surprisingly through all the noise the old man was fast asleep. I looked back to see the gorilla burst through the front door, he was locked on me like a heat seeking missile I made it to my car and prayed it would start but the key would not turn over. The gorilla ripped the passenger side door off as if if were opening a can of tuna, I quickly got into the fetal position as I was cry praying and begging not to be ripped apart the gorilla slowly reached in with its massive hands and poked me on the shoulder and said "you're it !" In a raspy voice.
