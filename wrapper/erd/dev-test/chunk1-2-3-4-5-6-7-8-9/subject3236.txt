   Its winter in Australia right now

hahaha sorry I didn't thought about it.. I recreated the logo from scratch. [here the psd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3jagjlacGj2MXQzUmdpeE41RGc/view?usp=sharing) 




 I run Win 7 x64 with 8 GB Ram and with Photoshop CC 2014 I didn't have any problem. Then I did a format and upgraded to CC 2015. Since then I can't render videos when I send and animation to render and photoshop crashes once in a while in various cases. Is anyone experiencing similar situations?

 I tried.. http://i.imgur.com/lJJZ0tK.jpg 




 Your welcome, and sorry for the mess.. 




 nope, I believe that we all have the right to love anyone we want and get married with anyone we want, I don't critisize people for who they love, I just don't like the idea. Freedom is for everyone and that's my opinion. Sorry but please don't continue the argument, we have opposite opinions and that's not a reason to ruin this gentlemans request. 




 I learned something from this picture, that's why I mentioned it. Please read carefully before commenting, people tend to get aggressive in these topics. 




 and that's exactly why I believe in freedom of speech! You did very good job there, looks great! 




 thanks 
























 [Here you go mate! UltraRealistic](http://i.imgur.com/4kMPBlI.jpg)

 patch tool http://i.imgur.com/VS2GCeP.png you can use it to remove pimples from faces. it actually does a smart copy and paste so the skin (example) will fit exactly were the pimple you selected was including most of times shadows and lighting thas why I used it there so I can actually create a smooth back ground like the first image
