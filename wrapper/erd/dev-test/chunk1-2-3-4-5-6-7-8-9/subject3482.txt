 No one can tell you whether or not you'll bond with your child.  You either want to, or you don't, it's that simple.  You're making it out to be some grand thing that no one has ever gone through before and is some great compromise you're making.  Stop it.  It's a new human being you're bringing to life and it's made from you. It's the greatest gift there is to give and is the only lasting contribution you'll probably ever make.  It's an investment in your own future.  If you don't want to end up a lonely old man you'll consider what things you'll want and will make you happy throughout your life.  For most people, it's the happiness that love and family bring.  If that isn't for you, let your wife find it elsewhere. 




 Regarding your title, I like going outside, it's pretty nice out there.  As far as your text goes, stop whining and do something about it if you care that much.  Complaining on the internet is not a solution.

 I'm not pontificating, I'm a grandparent who's cared for too many foster kids because of dads who didn't want to be dads.  I've far more real experience than you do, I'd bet. It's been my experience that it can go either of two ways; either he bonds with the newborn within a few days, or he does not.  If he does not, the child suffers and so does the mother since she's constantly having to make up for his lack of participation or, sometimes, abusive behaviour.  I'm sure there are some marriages that survive, but at what cost to the innocent child?  If you don't want to be called  daddy or won't step up for your own offspring, don't make someone else pay for it.

 Feelings of failure or inadequacy keep us looking back.  Why did they leave me?  Why wasn't I good enough?  What did I do wrong?  Could I have fixed it?  When in reality, it was probably nothing specific we did.  We're different people as we grow and change and aren't always suited to each other during certain phases of our lives.  There's probably something in a past relationship you miss and look to remind yourself of.  Just because we aren't with them doesn't mean the feelings disappeared.  It's ok to look back every now and then, just remember you're not who you used to be and have grown since then.

 I have two stories.  My sister once darted out into the road and was hit by a car.  I watched my dad woosh! over to it, pick that car up by himself and pull that child out.  She ended up with only a broken arm and he had a bit of trouble with his shoulder for a few days.  The other incident with her and my dad: she'd taken her aquarium into the bathtub to wash it(?) while he and I were outside throwing the ball around.  All of a sudden my mom let out a blood-curdling scream and, whoosh!, he was inside that bathroom, whipped off his belt and applied it as a tourniquet around her slashed up arm because she'd dropped it and it broke.

 We only get to be here a short time, but, we still get the opportunity to be here.  It's like a roller coaster ride, when our time is up someone else gets on the ride.  We only get to have the ones we love in our lives for an indeterminant amount of time.  Be glad we got them at all because it could have been a far different experience.  The cycle of life is as exactly as it should be. 




 I've heard people call those guys every name in the book and expect them to just volunteer to load up groceries, furniture, etc. immediately after questioning their intelligence and saying all kinds of mean things to them.

 I agree with your friend.  I don't need anyone to interpret what I should believe or not.  God has already told us how things are and I can pray anywhere, not just in a church.  I think people from every kind of church I've ever been to gave me some kind of insight, but so do relatives and coworkers and some posters on reddit.  We can gain knowledge or wisdom from anywhere if we're open to it. 




 Sure I can be a Christian, there were Christians while Jesus walked the Earth before the religion existed.  A Christian should be follower of Jesus.  I do not follow any of those specific requirements, beliefs or approaches because God didn't design them or say He condoned them.  He told us what to do and how to handle things in the Bible and that's all we need.  Not specific messages or anything that come from men. 




 God said all, I think He means all.  I don't think God hates anyone.  Jesus said He came for all men, that includes those who cursed Him.  While He was being sacrificed on the cross He even said, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do".  Can't be much clearer than that. 




 I don't think so because a Christian is simply a follower of Jesus.  They were called Christians while Jesus was still alive, before the actual religion began to take shape. 




 Religion, with it's attached requirements, celebrations, rituals, rules, certain attitudes or beliefs are all specific to the men who founded that particular religious interpretation.  They want to stand out in same way, usually as being the one true religion that has the truth and understanding of God's holy words on their side. .  That isn't what the Bible says, it says it's written for all men, not just the ones who believe like this religion or that one.  God says pray earnestly for understanding and you'll get it.  That book was written for everyone to understand, not just the "special" ones.   They all corrupt, in some way, what it clearly says. 




 Religions exist, all with their own specific requirements, beliefs. approaches and messages.  I don't support them. 




 I think mean things about people. 




 I am a Christian, I read the Bible and I believe in God, but I do not believe in religion.

 Swan, Drake, Crowe, Finch, Wrenn, Ferrett, Lyon, Fox and Byrd. 




 Apparently, they believe the poor or stupid cannot always afford an I.D.  I take issue with this because they need an I.D. to purchase, alcohol,  cigarettes, rent or buy a home, receive welfare, food stamps, social security, unemployment and medicaid, get a driver's license, go to school, buy a gun, get a job, get married, have a bank account, buy a car or a plane ticket.  They need an I.D. to rent a hotel room, get a hunting or fishing license, give blood or to even buy certain cough medicines.  Clearly the poor make good use of these programs and purchases.  No one ever raises the income or race issue on these things, but when it comes to voting they're all over it shouting discrimination.  This makes me think that that maybe the reason these liberals don't want to require an I.D. to vote could be because they could either be bringing in illegal voters, underage people and even the names of dead people.  Poor or not, they can and do get I.D.s for all these other needs and an I.D. for voting and proving legal citizenship is not an undue burden and should be required.

 A year after Amanda Berry disappeared in Cleveland, her mother appeared on "The Montel Williams Show" to speak to a psychic about what happened to her daughter.   Psychic Sylvia Browne, who has made a career of televised psychic readings, told Louwanna Miller on a 2004 episode of the show that her daughter was dead, causing Miller to break down in tears on the show's set.  "She's not alive, honey," Browne told Miller on the show.  Miller said that she believed "98 percent" in what Browne told her. Miller died a year later from heart failure. 

Amanda Berry is the women who escaped as a hostage from the home of  Ariel Castro and is very much alive. 




 Amanda Berry.  That psychic helped cause her mother's death and should be prevented legally from ever giving out this kind of bogus information.  That said, people are stupid for putting any stock in these people to begin with. 




 People who believe horoscopes are some kind of special, hidden knowledge and schedule their lives around them.  People who believe psychics are telling them the truth, especially when they conjure up dead loved ones.

 Judge Lind ruled that the 3 and 1/2 effective "years" Mr. Manning has already served since his 2010 arrest (a total inflated by time in solitary confinement) would count towards the 35-year sentence.  That leaves Mr. Manning with only 31 and 1/2 years left in the sentence.  If he does not win an appeal or get parole, he would be 56 years old when he gets out of federal prison.  However, in all likelihood he will get out long before then.  One possibility, albeit unlikely, is an appeal or a pardon.  Much more likely is the possibility of parole.  Mr. Manning's lawyer said that with military court parole rules, if Mr. Manning continues his good behavior as a prisoner, he could be eligible for parole in 6 and 1/2 years.  In that circumstance he could see freedom by the age of 32.  Being granted parole is by no means guaranteed, particularly in controversial high profile cases, but there's always hope and possibility.

He did expose war crimes to the public, along with leaking 300,000 classified documents.  He's a convicted felon, whether we agree with it or not.

 That depends on who you ask.  I'm not for or against the man, but I believe he's reneged on many promises and expectations he cultivated for himself to get support.  He seems to be more pro-govt. and corporations than he is pro-Americans.  He promised an open presidency and whistleblower protections, among other things, only to have gone back on these promises.

 They'll equate "separate but equal" as the stance to take to push a particular point of view. But, it isn't the same.  Anyone who lived through those times knows it isn't the same because in this instance, they'll have what they wanted legally, whereas during the civil rights movement and segregation they did not.  They do not equate since this regards nothing more than a label placed upon it.

 Lets see, we're pro-abortion, pro-gay rights, took God and morals out of schools, left drug addicted parents to raise future generations, use pedobear as a joke, legitimized unhealthy sexual practices, promote degraded sexual values (or not values at all) and consider them conquests, men leave their their babies to be raised by their mommas alone on govt. assistance because they don't want the burden, women mistreat or ignore their babies because they become nothing more than a paycheck, we've forced families to send both parents to work leaving the raising of the kids to strangers, determined the belief in God is now a mental illness and should be quashed at every opportunity, treat our parents and kids with strong depressive drugs, create unattainable personal images for young people so they grow up knowing they aren't good enough, passed all the money to corrupt people running all governments and many businesses, burdened all our people (and especially students) with taxes and fees leaving them near poverty levels, promoted the hive mind of get-in-line-and-don't-think-differently paradigm, spread our unique brand of evilness around the world and we wonder what happened while we weren't looking.  The blessing has been removed, my friend, it's gone for good.

Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, Democrats who both serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and have access to the nation's most sensitive secrets, released a statement contradicting this assertion. "Gen. Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the NSA's bulk phone records collection program helped thwart 'dozens' of terrorist attacks, but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods," the two senators said.

Indeed, a survey of court documents and media accounts of all the jihadist terrorist plots in the United States since 9/11 by the New America Foundation shows that traditional law enforcement methods have overwhelmingly played the most significant role in foiling terrorist attacks." 




 Mine would be 0.  She's a nice lady who works harder than I do.  I like her. 




 Being as active and mobile as I am now.  I will not be in 20 years. 




 I don't agree.  Fox is decidedly conservative while NBC is decidedly liberal.  Guests who appear on those channels or news sites are quickly shot down or bullied due to their opposing positions.  Each one caters to a particular mind set, as do the others.  They can say they're unbiased all they want but it doesn't make it true. 




 "I just really want an unbiased answer based on facts instead of opinions."  Yeah, don't we all. 




 Fox News and NBC aren't any different from any other major news site, they just happen to be of a particular point of view opposite to each other.  They're all large corporations going for the money, they all know what sells and they go after it.  There are no completely unbiased news sites and those are as valid as any other.  You have to read both sides to get an idea of the truth.

 What are you talking about? Black people use the word all the time.  It is not up to me or you to determine if that's offensive to God or if it isn't, or, if that is considered taking the Lord's name in vain since "God" isn't His name.  You should stop and let God do the judging.  You can't put your personal morality on other people.  Do what's right for you and let God take care of the rest.  Will saying the word "fuck" keep me out of heaven, too? 




 I find it offensive too, but it's their right to say any word they want to.  Make your preference known to the people doing it and then leave it alone.  They're adults with the right to free speech, just like you are.  Remember, you aren't their judge or jury.

 Nope, not me, sorry.  I can't tell you that. 




 I'd buy a new chair I've been looking at for two weeks. 




 Assad is not a stupid man.  This is part of the plan and he's the sacrificial lamb.  Defense secretaries seem to have a penchant for war and declaring things with no proof but a few internet supplied videos.

 I'd explain the situation to the customer and why I can't take any action at this time, take down all pertinent information so that I could get on it first thing Monday morning. Then I'd follow through on my word on Monday. 




 I'm against killing any animal for reasons other than consumption.  If you're going to eat it then it's ok to use the skin. 




 You should have asked him to elaborate on that.  That's going to happen no matter a person's age.  I get that crap from 12 year olds.  Everybody's an expert when you disagree with them. 




 No one cares about your jeans or your shoes.  Stop posting this crap before you're reported. 




 Print out a note and tape it on the building where they're sure to see it.  Tell them they've been observed participating in illegal activities and if they're seen there again the police will be notified.  You aren't going to stop them no matter what you do, so you might was well warn them to move along. 




 The majority of Americans don't trust or support them any more than you do.  I wouldn't be surprised if they reach the point of saturation sooner than the government expects. 




 As long as they don't work together directly and one isn't the others' superior I don't see a problem with it. 




 I think you've figured out that American citizens are not the government.  Nowadays, they do things without securing proper approval or the citizens' support first.  The majority do not support any intervention in Syria and want more attention paid to domestic issues.

 I don't believe it's your business, either, despite your finger-shaking. 




 Because it's common courtesy to be respectful to others and some people are more vocal about that expectation.  Those people have lived through far more than you have and have more knowledge and wisdom in things you don't know about yet. 




 You want hope that things will change just like the rest of us.  I'm afraid that isn't going to happen no matter how much we want it to or spout off on websites.  Climate change is the least of your worries, or should be.  There are far greater evils at work right now over which we have no control. 




 How old are you?  Are you living at home with parents? 




 I think they want Assad out one way or another.  If a "threat" to get that ball rolling is required, then a "threat"  is what they will have.

 My friend attended the culinary arts program at the community college.  She remained almost debt-free through Pell grants and such.  The chef teaching the class hired her at a fine-dining restaurant he managed.  She learned so much about banquet cooking and how a kitchen actually operates.  She completed that program and is now in the baking program, since that's what she likes to do.  She did very well in school and is currently spending a month in France working with those chefs and bakers in different restaurants.  She's very good and has a great future ahead of her.  Opportunities seem to present themselves, even at the community college level. 




 It's a long list. 




 I was in my driveway about to head to work when I heard a news bulletin on the radio.  I ran back inside, turned on the tv to see it happening right before my eyes.  I just kept repeating "WTF", over and over for a while as the realization of what was actually happening sank in. 




 I'd get rid of all those nasty executive orders that I really don't like.  I'd pardon whistleblowers who did what they did for the good of the country, and I'd seek charges against all those responsible for the banking scandals.  After that, I'd seek charges against some people for war crimes committed outside the US. 




 I see them as actors playing a part.  They have to look and act decent when they're in front of a camera and say all the right things people want to hear.  They don't have to believe it, just say it.  It's a high paying job for those who can do as they're directed to do. 




 They can track you through GPS, have your home and cell phone numbers, records of all calls in and out, financial account info, pics of you, your family and friends, know if you have registered guns and what political persuasion you ascribe to and what car you drive.  Yes, I'd say they could blackmail anyone they wanted.

 Car problems.  I'm not a mechanic and don't know much about them, so when the smallest thing goes wrong I automatically imagine it will cost me thousands of dollars.   




 You should add tobacco and cotton farming in there too.  I worked a tobacco field once and never again.  Hardest thing I've ever done.  I do not recommend. 




 Weekends are very busy and usually aren't staffed by the regular personnel.  Some wait until Monday for perceived better care.   




 That isn't what this subreddit is for.  Did you even read the sidebar? 




 The effects on their economies was probably true.  Slaves helped build the economic foundations of the new nation. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 solidified the central importance of slavery to the South's economy.  That was an important factor to the rich, white landowners during the abolitionist movement. It provoked a great debate over slavery that tore the nation apart in the bloody American Civil War.  




 I grew up in Virginia and we had two years of Virginia history.  I think we got a realistic view on slavery and how it was practiced throughout the American colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries. 




 It isn't offensive or honorable to me.  It's like others such as Patriots, Steelers, Chiefs, Raiders, 49ers or the Browns.

Here's a [solved mystery.](http://i.imgur.com/BHl85iy.png) 




 Yes. 




 Air conditioners. 




 I have a male coworker named Shannon. 




 I'd feel far less stable being dependent on someone than I feel being responsible for myself.  Why do you need anyone else to feel stable?  Are you afflicted in some way, or are you able to take care of yourself and
 just lack the confidence? 




 I'll pass on the bugs. 




 They become fish food. 




 No, it doesn't matter.  Any woman could easily have sex multiple times every day. 




 It was more fun and less serious than today. 




 Nothing, actually. 




 60 is a senior citizen now?  It just keeps getting younger. 




 Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came.  You wanna be where you can see our troubles are all the same.  You wanna be where everybody knows your name. 




 My inevitable dependence on others. 




 Integrity. 




 No reason to take the kids out tonight, wait until tomorrow.  Keep it clean and cover it until then. 




 I'd go to the E.R. and get a tetanus shot and have them clean it out and cover it. 




 Caffeine.  I need my coffee fix every day. 




 It's so sad that our nation has come to this.  I would never have  imagined that US citizens would be so afraid of their own elected government.  But, here we are. 




 Why do you believe they'd all be so passive? 




 Russia and China have already committed warships to the region and committed to fighting any attacks on Syria. Iran is mobilizing its troops. Britain and France have committed warships to the region to support ours. Israelis have been given gas masks in fear of an Iranian retaliation.   Unlikely, you say, but I say most probable. 




 Of course it will.  Nations have already made preparations for it and forces have been moved into place. 




 Being a douche to the person trying to keep you from dying prematurely sounds like a great plan. 




 It's hormonal. 




 Unfortunately, you can be fired or laid off at any time.  They do not have to hold your job. The position needed to be filled and they filled it.  You were expendable from the moment you left work. 




 That depends on which side of the fence you sit on and which side you find most credible.  Both sides defend their points of view vehemently and show "evidence" to support themselves.  Videos tell a lot, as well as the news reports of that morning in the US and in other countries reporting on it. 




 I didn't ridicule anyone, so your comment is unwarranted.  Judging from the appearance of presidents before and after holding office, it's definitely a hard 4 year stint. 




 Askreddit is the third largest subreddit in terms on number of subscribers.  I'm sure the admins/mods feel they're needed here. 




 I've come to regret voting for every president I've ever voted for. 




 If you want good care and information you're willing to wait for it.  Most people like that kind of thing and spend time with their physician to get as much information as possible.  Sometimes it takes more than 15 minutes.  




 I don't think there's any such thing as a quiet mind.  Our brains are phenomenal, always on and not built for intentional complete shut-down mode. 




 Politics.   




 Well then, since you have such a good plan, I suggest you visit the local prison and ask some guy who's been convicted of drug trafficking to tell you the name of his supplier.  Surely he'll share that info with you. 




 If you don't know where to get them you probably shouldn't have them.

 What more do you want?  They've already confirmed suspicions; it's a base for testing top-secret aircraft and weaponry.  You want UFO's, but  what if it was nothing more than some type of spycraft from a different country trying to gather intel?  There won't be any alien presence disclosed because they do not exist. 




 They're tolerated because there is no other choice in the matter.

 I'm only familiar with its' religious application. 

"Today, it is commonly used in reference to any prophetic revelation or so-called End Time scenario, or to the end of the world in general.  

The Biblical prophets' revelations show God's justice as taking place in the future or as imminent now. The genre of revelation aims to show God's way of dealing with humankind and His ultimate purposes, and its writers often reveal the meaning of present events in connection with the ending of the present age." 




 There shouldn't be any more taxes period.  We're overtaxed already.  If they want to make improvements they should start offering vocational classes and teach people how to do those specialized jobs. 




 If he actually follows through on the threat of engagement while everyone's telling him not to, probably so.  If he takes the negative responses he's getting and acts like a president, then no, probably not.

 My grandfather liked a particular story about when my dad was dating my mom.  My dad would sometimes walk to their house to see her and hang out or help my granddad around their place, just do whatever came up.  They lived down a long, dirt road with tall pine trees on both sides and they could see him coming.  One day my mom was sitting on the porch watching him walk towards the house, when my granddad burst out of the screen door with a gun, yelled for my mom to get inside, scaring her to death.  She saw my dad, then the gun, and started yelling, "No, daddy, no!" because she thought he was going to shoot him.  Grandad pushed her inside while holding the door open, when all of a sudden my dad started running as fast his legs could carry him.  He raced onto the porch just as the gun went off, but turned his head just in time to see the big black panther stumble behind him.  Grandad saved my dad from the jaws and claws of death.

 I'm one of those weird people that likes working on Black Friday.  I always volunteer to work and pocket some extra money because of it.  Not a single one of my coworkers opted out of working that day because we schedule time with family around our work hours.  My community benefits economically from the holiday season, as I'm sure most due.  It's crazy to make a big deal about this and blame the retailers for somehow being unjust to employees just because it's a holiday.  We work all the other holidays too.  Not everyone works in an office Monday-Friday.

 "All national parks would likely be closed, as would the Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo in Washington. Visitors using overnight campgrounds or other park facilities would be given 48 hours to make alternate arrangements and leave the park. Among the visitor centers that would be closed: the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Alcatraz Island near San Francisco and the Washington Monument."

 It was never necessary, it was just smart and fulfilled the needs and desires of people, just as it still does.  People still get married just like they always have and my sister makes her living off them.  She does very well. 




 No, it wasn't a mistake.  Small poodles get killed by other dogs often because they're annoying little shits.  Big dog probably had enough of the yapping and jumping and finally took care of him his own way.  Keep little dogs away from him.

 Older retirees will still have bills to pay, so no they won't.  They'll stay in their jobs until they die just to be able to live.  Utility bills and rent won't go down just because of Obamacare.  I think it'll make it even harder for young people to find employment.  I'm 57 now and should have been retiring at 62, but I don't see that being able to happen until I'm at least 70, if I live that long. 




 I've never had any problems with the police, just the opposite, actually.  I go about my life as I always have for the last five decades now.  I don't feel imposed upon, restricted or oppressed in any way.  I control my own money, decide which job I want or don't want, raise my kids the way I want and come and go as I please.  I have ample, good food, can afford my expenses and am paid what I deserve.  I have no issues with this country and am as free as I was since the day I was born.  I read these bad things but in my daily life they have no effect on me, so far.  I'm a happy camper here.

 Did your girlfriend dump you, is that why you're so angry at women?  Or is it because you can't seem to keep the attention of one?  No?  Did mommy treat you mean so you've decided to do the same?  Grow up boy. 




 There's no such thing as inferior people, we are all just people.  The equality you're referring to pertains to legal issues, not physical ones.  If there were no laws against violence towards women there would be far more abused and murdered women in the country and we have too many already.

 Don't delete her, she can still be your friend.  Speak to her when you run into her, but don't search her out.  Be cordial, be cool but don't act like you're all that into her.  Keep your options open and keep looking. 




 The hint is, she doesn't want a relationship and doesn't want you to get attached or to depend on her.  She has zero emotional investment and wants to keep it that way.  Just let it go, she isn't girlfriend material.

 You're treading on dangerous ground here and you know it.  You say there's nothing sexual about it, but you know there is, even if it's just a little curiosity.  I wouldn't tell your husband since you;ll end up holding his feelings against him.  On the other hand, you shouldn't have to hide things from him either.  My advice would be to let the past stay in the past and for you to stop chatting with this married man.  You two have a history together, but your husband is your current commitment and your future and he comes first.

 You see how monolithic, slow, burdensome and unresponsive our federal government is. How in the hell could you possibly think that letting some jokers run the whole world would be anything but an abysmal failure?  As much as I like the idea of a completely free world where everyone has constitutional rights, I dont trust the government to keep their promise. Its great in concept but in reality, I think if it were attempted to be applied, we would get a much different point of view that turns out to not be such a good thing. I dont think the guys that wrote our Constitution had that much faith in government either, which is why a lot of the things in the Constitution were written specifically to limit the role and the amount of power that the govt had.

1.) It would inevitably become perverted, corrupt, and totalitarian, no matter how it started out.

2.) It's much better to have a variety of government policies for the diverse cultures of the world than one single set that everyone shares.

3.) If a one world government was in place, it's not for the benefit of humanity. The elite, those above the government, these people you never see...presidents and other politicians are controlled by them. They only have their own benefit in mind. All they want from us are the power of our thoughts, our money and fruits of our labors, controlled and manipulated through media, entertainment, military and education. 




 Depends, did I look good? 




 Only the hired militants and sociopaths will turn their guns on fellow citizens.  I don't for one second believe the majority of police officers or military personnel would turn on our country or our neighbors. 




 Until something personally affects the daily life of the average citizen, they don't pay it much mind.  They don't get all worked up over things they read on the internet or the game-of-the-week played out by govt. politicians.  People can see the patterns, see the direction we're headed in.  But until it touches them, it's just not relatable. 




 Perhaps you generalize 'Us Americans' too broadly. 




 A declaration of martial law would change things drastically.  There are far more people opposed to the very concept of this than you can imagine.  Some authorities would be very surprised at the response they would get.  This country is heavily armed, by good guys as well as bad guys.  If I was in government I wouldn't want to give them all a reason to unite against me.  100 million people united in a cause could make serious changes to their status quo.

 I watched a video once where they took a bunch of plants and divided them into two groups.  They separated the two and hooked the second group up to electrodes that measured their electric impulses.  In an area separated by a wall, they chopped up a plant from the first group.  As they whacked away, the electrodes recorded highly increased activity in the plants that were separated, as if they were screaming whenever the plant was cut.  Weird stuff.  Also, the movement of plant roots as they grow seem to be purposeful movement and always head towards the nutrients, crowding out non-relative plants to the point of their deaths.  Some plants send out distress signals to predator insects while being eaten by certain insects, so that predator insects will come and destroy the insect that's eating the host plant.  Daughter vines can "smell" the type of plant they want to attach to, so my question is, how do they do all this without a brain?  It's purposeful behaviour.

 There are so many things in your comment that I disagree with, but I'll comment on this one: 

"Society cannot correctly set and achieve it's goals without the direction and vision of government because it is controlled by the ignorant horde that we know as the masses."

Do you not understand that you are also considered one of the ignorant masses?  Societies can't set or achieve goals *because of* governments like you're suggesting.  Politicians of any sort aren't ones to be trusted with the common good, just the opposite.  They enjoy their corrupting activities and having control.  They're egomaniacs who have only their own best interests in view.

 I'm confused on what you want to see.  You can see what anyone posts by clicking on their name. 




 Politics and religion. 




 I don't see much of that here. 




 "creationism is mocked and disregarded", I'm afraid that's what you'll get here, as well. 




 The notion that respect must be earned first, before being extended. 




 "religion makes people easier to rule".   I can't agree less on this point.

"I don't want to directly force religion onto people because that causes the masses to resent authority".  People resent authority, religiously oriented or not and you cannot force religious belief at all.  

"via, evolution God's means of creating etc" You cannot force someone to mentally accept what they do not agree with.

"government should be geared toward the advancement of human intelligence and ability".  No, this is not the responsibility of government, it is the responsibility of society.  It is generally agreed that the most important single function of government is to secure the rights and freedoms of individual citizens. Thomas Jefferson asked:  "Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with his wrath?" Government becomes primarily a mechanism for defense against bodily harm, theft and involuntary servitude. It cannot claim the power to redistribute the wealth or force reluctant citizens to perform acts of charity against their will. Government is created by the people, for the people, not for an oligarch.

  "Do you agree that the hyper-liberalism that is American liberalism will lead to a state of nature, and that though too religiously oriented and restrictive, American conservatism is more conducive to progress, simply because of it's ability to ultimately maintain a civilized society better than American liberalism in the long run?"

No, neither are conducive to progress, only to eventual self-destruction.  A completely new paradigm would be needed for "progress".

 I know how scary that can be. My dog started to have seizures out of nowhere.  Found out it was the RAID ant spray I was using.  I hope she pulls through ok. 




 Due to an ice/snow storm I got to go home 4 hours early from work.   I had a great nap. 




 There will be an Islamic caliphate centered in Istanbul, Turkey.  Erdogan and Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi are making great progress in setting this up. 




 Turkey was home to the 4th and last Caliphate, abolished in 1924.  The last was Abdulmecid II of the Ottoman Dynasty. He was replaced by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, know as the Father of secular Turkey 1923. He sought to westerize the country which conflicted with conservative Muslm beliefs.  This lead to an identity crisis for the country: go back to our roots in a glorious caliphate that was admired, or become a secular western country.  The man elected as the 12th President, Recep Erdogan,  doesn't like the secular model and is trying to return the country to a caliphate, with himself as the caliph. He views ISIL, and similar groups, as his way to achieve that.  




 They didn't want to have to run after him.  Takes too much effort for that.  Just shoot his ass, that'll stop him. 




 An instant mind-reading device. 




 I don't necessarily think they are.  There have been some ugly babies in our gene pool.
 




 Since Turkey is going to be the center of their eventual caliphate, I'd restrict them to Turkey, but they must allow for people to come and go as they please.  Not everyone supports sharia. 




 Not for years.  I must say, I do miss him cooking for me. 




 Treeninja.  It's a game I play with my niece.
 




 I watch ufo "documentaries".  It's ridiculous, but I do it.   




 The Star Trek replicator.  We still don't have it and my microwave will not synthesize meals on demand. 




 Chili-cheese dogs.  If you serve hamburgers you should also serve hot dogs.  They go together. 




 They'd be signing up for a chunk of alone time.  I don't like being around people for too long.

 In a new development Friday night, the Washington State Patrol said the boyfriend  a 38-year-old man from Miami, Okla.  had been arrested by authorities in Oklahoma late Friday and was booked in jail to await extradition back to Washington. 




 Tldr: Brian Williams' apology was NOT sincere.  




 You'd need to research whose financial investments are threatened by an analysis of data comparing the health of children vaccinated with those not vaccinated.  I doubt a credible study exists. 




 What a beautiful little child. Congratulations.  




 Must be kin to [this guy](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4019/4251885937_b84e8c0f0a_z.jpg). 




 Alrighty then, in that case, let me refer you to Wilmington, N.C. (great, safe community) or Virginia Beach, Va. (great weather, more jobs). The further south you go, the bigger the mosquitoes and higher the humidity.  




 Depends on what you mean by "mild weather'.  You do know we have high humidity and get hurricanes here, right? 




 Ghost ship. 




 What a beautiful place.  You really have a green thumb. 




 I'm late fifties worrying about nothing and enjoying this fine bottle of Pinot Noir tonight.  You kids shouldn't worry so much about your bills.  They'll get paid, one way or another,  Worry about the man or woman you're sharing your life with, if you have one.  If you don't have one, get a dog.  Or a cat. Or something that's alive and needs you.  Just be glad for this moment, this very minute you're alive.  It's fucking glorious, man.  So many people didn't wake up this morning, but you did.  Worry only gets you high blood pressure and long-term drug dependence, problems with loved ones, intestinal issues and surgery for bleeding ulcers.  Choose to be happy no matter your present conditions.  Go listen to some Pink Floyd and have a nice glass of wine with a friend.  Or alone, either way.  Life is good and it's good to be here on this Earth with all its' beauty and nice clean air and water.  Plus!, we have the benefit of Mexican food.  Holy hell,  we don't need anything else to be happy, unless it's a good blackberry margarita outside under the big umbrella with some fabulous Mexican food.  Life is so good.  I'm so glad I have it.  I might be a fucking hippie in my mind though, so there
 is that.

 NBC should find a more trustworthy replacement for her.  She can no longer be trusted to follow simple instructions for the protection of others and doesn't set a good example at all. 




 You're wrong; it is great.  Very nice when viewing silent underwater scenes.

 Trade-in  your old games at Walmart.  You get a gift card that you can spend any way you want.  I used mine for gas. 




 Here are some  articles that refute that premise:

Honestly, I'm not convinced by them either.  Perhaps this is a question better suited

 I've been paying $18 a month for basic tv for over two years now.  I had it shut off earlier this week and was surprised to find I receive even more channels without it.  With broadband I have no reason to spend the extra money.

 My bad. Thanks. 




 They should start asking for donations to help pay for the damages to the ~~Quik-Mart~~ QuikTrip.

 




 Tell that to the senator who tweeted "Fuck you" to the Governor. 




 Why are local police afforded more personal body armour and weaponry than military forces fighting in war-torn countries?  Shouldn't we be looking at the types of people being hired as police personnel if they're so very willing to follow orders and shoot at innocent civilians?  Who hires these aggressive people? 




 And yours are all anti-Israel in nature, so it doesn't help at all. 




 That bear has better posture than I do. 




 Ferris wheels.  It's just not the same when you aren't 4 ft. tall anymore. 




 Genuine love for other people in all shapes and sizes.  They aren't cutthroat, sleezy and they won't steal from you or stab you in the back.  They'll help take care of you when you get some dread disease and will come to your parties when asked.  They give nice gifts.

 Would you like ISIS, Hezbollah, PLF, Al-Aqsa, Al-Qaida  and Hamas to rule the world? Would that be better for you? 




 Wow, it's beautiful.  You did a great job. 




 No, they aren't always nice tags.

 "They took all the trees
 And put 'em in a tree museum.
 Then they charged the people
 A dollar and a half just to see 'em. 

 Don't it always seem to go
 That you don't know what you've got
Til it's gone.
 They paved paradise
 And put up a parking lot."

 What's the point of having it operate so differently on this one subject?  Who's going to decide what's important enough for threads like this and what isn't?  This defeats the purpose of the way reddit operates.  If I wanted randomized, I'd choose randomized.  I cannot tell what's new and what isn't.  I prefer it the regular way.  If I get overburdened with content of one kind or another I just scroll down and skip it.  This takes away choices and I do not support it. 




 From the article:

"A #BBCtrending investigation has found that many of these images are not from the latest conflict and not even from Gaza. Some date as far back as 2009 and others are from conflicts in Syria and Iraq."

 The US has counties larger than that.  It's only 998 sq. miles, so I don't think it could ever be considered a separate state. 




 We don't do that anymore.

 Superiority complex. 




 They're minor things, but everything helps.  After baking something, leave the oven door open so the heat escapes and helps warm up the area.  Also, I cut the leg off a pair of pantyhose and secure it around the end of the dryer vent hose.  The hose in the floor next to the washer blowing out. That heat is also used to heat the area.  I figure, I have to pay once for that heat, why not use it as efficiently as I can  




 Chacarron.  Go ahead...say it. 




 No, I do not believe all people worship the same god.  There is only one God and only one book He says is given by His inspiration, is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness.   




 There's no lost knowledge, it's been written for thousands of years.

The Bible has nearly 800 references to Jerusalem- called the City of our God (Ps. 48:1,8) Jerusalem is Gods city, the city of Zion, he has invested his name there (Daniel 9:19).

Jerusalem is called the city of the great King (Matt.5:35). YHWH is called the God of Israel, He is not called the God of any other nation in this manner, The God of Jerusalem is key to the Jewish people, to Jesus and to the end of the age.

Zion is called the city of God. Isa 60:14: and they shall call you The City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel. It is where the Lord has and will dwell again. Joel 3:21: for the LORD dwells in Zion. When the temple permanently replaced the tabernacle and was built in Jerusalem it became the place of his dwelling, his presence was there, thus name Zion.

Ps. 132:13-14: For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for His dwelling place: This is My resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it. Ps. 87:1-3: His foundation is in the holy mountains. The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God! Selah

 She probably can't find a bra that fits her.   




 I had a horse when I was a kid, a gelding.  Silly thing would fight the dog for leftovers (especially spaghetti) and tried several times to come into the house through the back door.  He could drink Pepsi from a bottle and hardly spill a drop.  He also bit me when I wanted to go left and he wanted to go right.  He bucked my sister off into a ditch filled with tadpoles and she came up with green slimey hair and tadpoles dripping off her face.  I gave him a treat for that one. He was a boss.
