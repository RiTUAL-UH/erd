 teeth gritting? 




 With the facial hair and the kind eyes you're definitely my type!! You're very handsome, 8/10 




 Brash but truthfully, thank you i appreciate that. I don't think i'm ugly so to speak, but there are definitely features that I would consider ugly and sometimes they're all I can see so it brings me down.
That's what it comes down to I think. My boyfriend always calls me pretty truly he does like any good boyfriend would! But i'm a woman and subsequently tend to be too hard on myself.. 




 And i take that as a huge compliment haha. I'm really flattered thank you :) 




 Actually, regal is a really cool way to put it. I honestly never thought of it that way 




 i must say, well phrased! thank you! 




 i may be somewhat biased because i absolutely LOVE facial hair, but i really do think it suits you quite well! I would keep it, you have the kind of look that needs a nice manly beard. Not enough me grow em these days! wear it proud :) 




 finally a numbered rate! thank you. As for my bulldog bite it is definitely there, it's receded to the point that is a few milimetres past my top jaw. Even with that though it shouldn't be past my top jaw at all so it still makes me fee; self conscious. Love to hear that it's not noticeable though so thank you :) 




 Keep the facial hair, really suits you and looks great on men in general! 




 Thank you, perhaps i have anxiety over looking different from the norm. There's always that "typical" pretty and i think just about every girl is looking for it aha. 




 I am a mix of German and English, half and half. Could that have anything to do with my jaw line? I live in Canada if that provides any context aswell haha. But thank you, didn't know there was a genetic line behind the trait! But i could have assumed.. 




 hahahaha. Thank you ;) 




 They do seem to be common and I have always wasted one, but that is the way I should be looking at it i suppose. My jaw gives me a very round/oval face and I have mixed feelings about that. But thank you a lot it's reassuring to receive comments like this! :) 




 Thanks! I grew up with a reeeally bad under bite, but i was lucky to have it recede on it's own to the point that it's only a few millimeters past my upper teeth. It's at the point that I wouldn't bother with the jaw correction surgery but it's still noticeable enough to bother me!  




 Thank you for the comment! He's my boyfriend of a year so he's not too difficult to attract haha. honestly I've just always been jealous pretty girls with cute pointy little chins! I don't have that but i think it's adorable. 
























 Everyone here complains about being lonely, but they resent seeing people happy and in a relationship anyways! 




 what's that?
 




 actually safest with him :) 














 I have this one outfit with a hood and an awesome bra that makes me look like a monster haha! But it's winter in Canada and it's cold now so i can't wear tutu's and stuff, I actually need shorts. 




 These are awesome!! haha :) I love seeing themes! I honestly never get pictures when i'm at raves, I do nothing but dance and glove, so this time I got a picture before i went! i'm jealous you have such an awesome pic durring the event! 




 thanks for defending me! You understood exactly. I didn't claim it was original and I know others dress similarly because it's a pretty typical attire at raves now, but I still think it can be made into a lot of fun and creativity. You can't see it in the picture but i'm also wearing a homemade mask and light up bow. So it's crafting too!  




 I invite anyone to post their costumes below!!! I love seeing new ideas! 









 A quick, to the point answer. Something I appreciate :) thanks! that's pretty cool 









 I think overbites are cute for some reason! But Olivia Wilde is a good example. Maybe i have less to worry about than i previously assumed haha 




 You look better without them, it draws the attention to your eyes which are very nice :) 




 well that's my smile so.... bummer. 
























 I wasn't planning on doing any red. I did plan on some orange but I decided against it because of a background i may put on it in the future 




 Thanks! :) like I said im really indecisive about it right now which is why im waiting to make a decision. 




 I changed my mind! I decided im going to add more the the background on the piece, likely some blue/pink/orange tropical flowers. So its actually going to be a larger piece now rather than just the bird on its own. Perhaps. Not truly decided yet which is why im waiting! 




 Thanks! Her name is Lisa dowling she works from her home in the GTA. She's been tattooing for 20+ years so I really trust her with my pieces! 









 My next sit is February 6th, so i'll post one soon enough! :) i actually found it to be the most painful of any of my tattoos, i have 3 others which are all black and white, this is my first colour piece. I found the most painful spots we're the top of the wings near my butt and the back portion of the bird. But definitely the wings were the worst.

Considering it is the largest piece i've had and also the longest sit at 3.5 hours i feel that was part of the reason it began to hurt quite a bit. It's also a lot of shading and colouring in one spot, but definitely a sensitive area to get a large piece like this 




 When my tattoo artist was positioning it she was actually talking about how important it is that the lines follow your natural curve. I agree with her, if not it makes your body look off. Im really stoked she played good attention to positioning! 




 She doesn't, she has a group on facebook but I believe it's closed now and only previous clients can view it. She hard to get! The wait right now is about 6 months... PM me and I'll see what we can do! Btw hi from Whitby as well :) 




 She used to work at sinful inflictions in Whitby but ended up getting a great client base and left to work from her home! She now has a studio in her house, fully licensed and whatnot. 




 Yeah I found it originally as a chalk drawing and loved it! Searched up the artist and saw the blurb and then was of course sure to switch it up and give my artist her own personal freedom on the piece. It translated into a tattoo really well! 




 Im thinking orange and some mauve as well. Like a tropical colour theme 




 thank you! I gave her the basic idea and said to get creative with it and she honestly hit it out of the park! It looks like a pastel/watercolour which I find really amazing. 




 Thanks! On the next sit she'll be adding some orange into the blank areas and colouring the tail feathers. Im also considering adding some drop shadowing, but im not sure yet. 









 How come a girl can't just like a hairy man? i hate the concept of manscaping, i think men are meant to be hairy and i don't expect him to remove his natural growth! 
























 Yeah thats the chalk drawing I saw of it first as inspiration. I then looked up the artist and found her deviant art page, read up on it and said she'd like it changed around for a tattoo. So as you can see I actually switched it up quite a bit with my tattooist.  




 Oops sorry!! I didn't realize this was risque in the traditional sense. I'll watch for that next time, thanks for the kind warning :) 




 The direction you're stepping in is outrageous for a first tattoo!! Firstly yes it would be very painful, the area around your eyes is thinly covered by skin and you would be tattooing right over bone which is the most painful.

But what you SHOULD be concerned about is the finality of tattooing your face. Tattoos are forever and your face is YOU, and how the world perceives YOU. there are a ton of things you have to consider before getting anything done neck up. Jobs, dating, social standing, acceptance of the people around you, and dealing with how people will inevitably judge you in a matter of seconds. It will reshape your life by having a facial tattoo, and this is what you really should be considering, not the pain level!

The fact that you're considering something this drastic for a first go based off of fantasy art on LOL makes me think that you're not ready for your first piece of ink. Dont do it! 




 It's covered haha so no fear here! 




 No no no lisa did not copy it, that was my original inspiration that I brought to her, but as the blurb on the bottom says I had it changed around quite a bit (colours, dimension, style) before tattooing it. Remember that i came to lisa with the idea, she didnt copy the bird because I asked for a quetzal 




 As I said previously, inspired more than anything because I still chose to change things for personal taste since it is my permanent decision. I was mostly inspired by their tail feathers and then afterwards the story. I gave my artist the basis and what I liked/didn't like and this is what we created :) 




 Haha I like that! That's exactly how im going to think of it now :) 




 Oh wow I had no idea that's a really cool story! I was aware the green had to do with flourishing crops but I hadn't realized the story behind the red belly. Being that it's yellow it's realistic that I could add a strong colour like red on top of it. But honestly I find red to be such a strong colour and it illicits ill feelings from me for some reason. 

Kind of overwhelms me, I think because my grandparents LOVED red and everything was red red red. They had these thick red curtains that blocked out all the light in the room I'd sleep in when visiting, and once I couldn't find my way out of the room because it was dark. I started crying and my mom ran in and turned on the lights and it was red everywhere and I just hated it after that haha. Kind of ridiculous what sticks with you from childhood. 




 It's your national bird right? And traditionally yes it should, but as you can see this isn't traditional in the strictest sense, its more so inspired by a quetzal and left to some interpretation from my artist. I kept the green because it's my absolute favourite colour and 70% of the bird is green, but I wanted to play with the other colours a bit. I'm not a huge fan of red either (surrounded by it as a kid) so that was the first colour I bumped. 




 I really like this. I like to think of it as "one blind, and one able to see", it's a nice contrast and kind of an artist way to interpret this. 




 In the GTA, Whitby Ontario. She's amazing but oddly enough she doesnt promote herself much! Just has a private group on facebook that im lucky enough to be a part of. She's really humble and has a loyal client base all by word of mouth. 

Recently she was featured as a great Canadian artist in a magazine and I was so happy for her because she never asks for recognition. 




 Wow quite the compliment! Thank you I appreciate that :) 




 Well this is definitely the place to be! Just make sure you switch yours up a bit and allow the artist some creative freedom once you decide on a basic design. You'll like it more once you make it unique to your tastes! 




 Thank you! I'd like to see it! Pm me a pic of it :) 




 Well firstly it is a beautifully coloured bird and a very feminine image to have on my body (even though this image is based on the male) which is what initially caught my eye. 

But also after looking into it, and as someone touched on previously by mentioning quetzalcoatl, the quetzal was viewed by the Mayans as the god of the air and believed to bring light and goodness to the people. I just really like the meaning behind that and what it once meant to an ancient culture. 





























 Yes! I hope we find people to craft with! Id definitely cone to your tent to make some kandi :) let me know! 




 Not a problem haha. Ill just give my boyfriend my order. He's 22 so he'll have no problem. 




 Holy shit that is a lot!! 




 Perfect! Not worried about the neighbours, more excited to get to know them actually! Honestly none of us would imagine bringing drugs over the border... i only plan on bringing myself, my supplies and a whole ton of kandi! :) I hate leaving g the purchasing up to chance though, ypu just never quite know who to trust..

I'm really happy to hear they allow alcohol into the camp though! That's perfect for us. Its also nice to hear you can carry alcohol around with you and dont have to stay in the pit, knowing that it'll be no problem getting some. Thanks so much for the informative reply! Love when experienced people are willing to help out :) 




 Myself, my boyfriends and a group of about 10 friends are going to be going to electric forest this year and we're absolutely ecstatic! Id like to say that firstly we're all really interested in meeting as many of you as possible and creating new friendships and experiences with this! :) it looks like there is so much music and culture to explore at this festival and that is definitely part of what got us so interested.

  So we've already read the festival guide that's on this subreddit and it is SO helpful so thank you to those that helped to put it together. We made a list of our own based on some of the points on there. But we still have some alternate questions that either weren't answered, or were answered very loosely. Firstly I was wondering, how much room do they allow for your tent/shade tent? If you were going with 10 people, would they allow you to put 3 or 4 tents in the same area with a shade tent in the middle or there abouts? 

Also, as Canadians not all of us are legal drinking age in the States. About half of us are, where as I and a few others are only 20 and won't be able to drink there. Is it possible to bring your own beer in and get it past the car check? How thorough are they and what do you suggest for success? Is it possible to get a beer from the bars on the festival grounds if you're not 21? Im assuming its like a beer pit and you can't.

Our last question regards the availability of substances at the festival. Since we must cross the border to get into Michigan there is no chance we will be bringing any substances like weed or MDMA with us. Though we could hide it well and it would be unlikely to get fully searched, if they found anything it would be automatically considered trafficking and that would ruin a lot more than just the festival haha. None of us are willing to risk it. My boyfriend and I have already purchased a test kit which I think is essential, but how would you prevent yourself from getting ripped off on different substances in the first place? If anyone knows of trustworthy people at the festival we'd love a pm about it, it would make us feel a lot more secure regarding the whole thing. I also understand that these things are more expensive in the states than in Canada, and if anyone has information on that, it would also be appreciated :)

And really that's all we have to ask! As I said, the guide was really well put together and answered almost everything. Mostly we had some Canadian specific questions :) I look forward to some answers from all of you experienced foresters, thanks everyone! :) see you in the forest! 




 Not all women like them, but if that the women who do, REALLY do. 




 I saw this on the front page something like 5-8 days ago with the same title... I feel like im going crazy how does this have upvotes at all! 









 Damn happy you posted and explained this. Im not sure how this isnt really common knowledge for adults! Or for women at least. Lady parts are a sensitive mistress! 




 This. I personally don't have this problem, but lightly rinsing and scrubbing it with just water is a common suggestion for women who are prone to yeast infections. Vaginas do a lot of self cleaning, so technically speaking you dont need soap, just a good wash! 




 Could you slow down? You're going fast. 




 The first sit was about 3.5 hours and the second one was only maybe 2 hours. A little less even. 




 I did in my last post a week ago! The picture had been previously posted on reddit so I know it is known, and I have no shame in discussing it when the original art is posted. If it were a secret I'd try to flag these posts or some other kind of ridiculous internet show of shame. 




 If you frequent /r/tattoos often enough you'll begin to realize that a lot of people's inspiration comes from other sources, just this week there was a guy who was on the front page for a couple of days with a watercolour painted style pheonix. He posted the picture he was inspired by and they were nearly identical. It's like a boost of creativity or an outline for what you might want, a lot of styles designs and pieces I see here are definitely partly inspired by tattoos before them. It would be ignorant to say I was the first one to work off of someone elses design for their own idea.

Also, if you look at her drawing and my tattoo the execution is very different, the only truly similar thing is the pose of the bird and I was very sure of that.

As I said, I found it as a chalk drawing and looked her up to find the original piece. She said she didn't mind it being used IF changed for a tattoo. So I used different colours and styles on it. I was sure not to tattoo the exact drawing on my body.

Edit: added context 
























 That is the BEST way to meet new people at shows! I had the same thing happen to me durong Wolfgang Gartners show here in Canada and I met a group of 4 really awesome guys and rahed with them for the entire night, now we go to a lot of events together! I hope the two of you are still raging g on together :) I love the story! 




 Epic pic haha! I love thay you introduced her to it and she ended up loving it, its so great when things work out perfectly like that :) im happy for you two, keep in keepin on :) 




 i was there and LOVED his set. No top 40 crap, lots of dirty house beats and he was a lot of fun to watch. So happy doing what he was doing. What did you think? 




 So happy to see best friends posted!! I think it's a really good idea to use a festival as your reason to meet up, that works perfectly and totally makes it worth traveling for both of you :) i hope you guys keep raging together, you look like you have a lot of fun and i love to see that! Don't lose that with each other. Peace and love dear! :) 




 very cute! love the collage and your outfit :) 




 congrats on the happy love story, that's a story book way to meet, but with a little rave in there ;) haha. You two are cute, and obviously comfortable together. Keep it up! Love and happiness :)

I feel like we dont really SEE enough of eachother here! A huge part of why I rave is to get to know a completely diverse group of people in a different setting. Its like we all become the same for a night but so many people have completely different stories! So I encourage all of you to post a pic with you and your favourite rave partner, ive post one of myself and my boyfriend to get us started! You can post a friend, boyfriend/girlfriend, or even a family member if youvhappen to be that lucky!

I also think it would be great if you posted a little blurb on how you met eachother/started raving together and what has made them so significant to you :) it'll be a little bit like a show and tell about your personal rave story! Alright go! 




 i tried to give 3 levels of done up, the first one is like full going out kinda makeup, the second is none and the 3rd is just mascara and bronzer 




 the one of me without makeup? I dunno i don't take many pictures of myself i have like none of my body too. Not sure what to put up here 




 Wow! That is extremely well done!! I have no idea how you made it look a little different on each side but that's really really great! :) thank you so much you can barely tell it was photoshopped at all.

Edit: a word 









 He walked in eating a cheeseburger hahaha 




 Of course! But my boyfriend didnt take a picture in time 




 In Oshawa Ontario!  





























 It's Canada right? Looks like mississauga 




 It took me a year to convince my boyfriend to let me do this! Something about it is just tons of fun :) it's something we don't have so I think it just becomes curiosity mostly. 




 no i live in Canada! 




 i'm not sure, but i'm not even mad. 




 I don't drink pop but i love my morning coffee haha 




 But,  it's me :( 




 i'm half german half asian. Compared to other mixed girls i've seen on here i can barely see it in myself! 









 I've always wanted to tell this story,  because I feel like it's a way I can kind of thank him. My boyfriend and went to Niagara Falls for a weekend last summer, as a small vacation while we were out of school. We're both in university and don't have all the money in the world, and since Niagara Falls was close for us it was a quick and cheap getaway we could enjoy together. Anyways both him and I love fine dining but don't get the chance to enjoy it very often. There was a beautiful high class gourmet restaurant in town that we decided to try and we were quite excited. 

We got all dressed up and walked to the restaurant and it was beautiful. Stunning decor and lighting, and the environment was very classy and comfortable. The menu prices were in the 40's-50's for entres. Since eating out was something that we loved to do but didn't get a chance to do very often, we decided to enjoy it and splurge some money because we deserved it, but still go for the cheaper end of things. The waitress came up and asked what we would like to drink and we both decided on a beer. While we were waiting we noticed a man sitting a few tables down with us, eating dinner with a woman and a young girl that didn't appear to be his. He smiled at us and we smiled back thinking nothing of it, just a friendly gesture! 

We then each ordered an appetizer and waited for them to arrive. After the man and his date had left the waitress walked up to us very surprised looking. She told us that the man had put a 200 dollar credit on our bill and payed for our entire meal. I was shocked, we hadn't even spent that much because we couldn't have afforded it. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and I started to cry. He hadn't even know our situation and I'm not even sure why he did it, but with that trip being all we could afford that summer it meant the world to me and all I wanted was to be able to say thank you. We decided to pay it forward by leaving about 50 dollars as a tip from what he had given us. It was the least we could do in the situation. That act of kindness still means the world to me, because eating there wasn't extremely affordable to us and he made the trip so much better.

TL; DR: random stranger pays for our bill at a very expensive restaurant after he leaves, put me in tears because my boyfriend and I had to save to go to this restaurant and he payed our bill 




 thanks! :) 




 same as my boyfriend haha, his creativity goes as far as tie dying some stuff, but i don't think it's as common for guys to have costumes anyways! 









 Awhh that is such a sweet story, love to see a husband and wife post here :) what a great way to get into electronic music, it's really life changing! If you're looking for a truly life changing festival you should look into going to Electric Forest in Michigan. It's a 4-8 day camping festival and gen. admission is pretty cheap for the length of it. But its SO much dofferent than any other festival. Just some friendly advice, id suggest you take a peek :) 




 Hey no worries, I raarely get a good quality picture with anyone at raves, pics are honestly my last worry. I like the story more than anything, I always love seeing two people adopt shows and festivals together :) keep it going, there are tons more left to experience! 




 She looks like quite the blast to party with, so I dont blame you. Whatever is going on there I hope you giys always stay in touch and keep it going :) dont lose your fave rave partner!

 Posted it, check my profile! 









 It wasn't at all! it was pan seared and finished in the oven :) 




 I'll post it once I'm home from work! it's actually incredibly easy. I make it through the week and it really only takes an hour or so altogether. 




 Best compliment I've gotten for my food yet hahaha 



















 TIL a lot of men appreciate green eyes  :) which is awesome 




 Truly I am... not offended? I understand his intentions and that's all that matters haha. 

If I had insecurities regarding the things he pointed out it may have been different though. But I do not :) 




 It's the highest form of compliment. 




 Well I've aaaalways wanted grey eyes! 




 Well I'm sorry that's all that matters to you.. 




 If you're living in Toronto you just might :) 












































 Oh I have relevant story for this! He actually did do competitive swimming for almost 10 years and he was quite good. The toe of course was no actual help with his swimming, essentially negligible. 

Well at one of the competitions he was in, one of the other swimmers noticed his freaky little toe and ran to the official and insisted it was cheating and he should be allowed to participate with an "advantage" like that. Official walked over and looked at his one connected toe and laugh, basically told the kid to shut up and that it was in no way an actual advantage haha. 




 Well if I do it, I'll be sure to provide pics of the process. 




 That's exactly what I think of!! I loved commander keep! Still run it on a Dos simulator from time to time :) 




 his mom had the option of separating them at birth, the bones are completely separate it's just the skin that holds them together. But she thought it was "unique" and kept them joined hahaha. 









 I don't care to see more of her, but the picture you posted is very clearly shopped. I don't know how you can't tell... 




 be a use its clearly been edited, this is "realgirls" shopped pictures shouldn't be in here 




 I work at a Tim Hortons and I've had customers complain to me about this several times. I agree that it is completely stupid to advertise their products on the menu board full of THEIR PRODUCTS, but I have had customers even yell at me regarding this. I feel like it's worth mentioning that we in store can't do anything about this. It's all down from corporate.
