 Watch out for nipple chaffing. 




 This should be in r/creepy haha 




 The one where Michael brainstorms different combinations of animals that people used to worship before god. I think it was in Fun Run. 




 He did lie about what had happened however, saying a gang attacked him. I think that if he had just come out told the truth at the beginning people would have been more sympathetic.

 I've always wanted the shirt that Dwight wears at Jim's wedding with the wolves howling. 




 Yes! And meeting Toby's brother, can't remember his name right now. 
























 I'd gladly face a shark in open water  any day than be trapped in the dark inky blackness 100 feet underwater  in a cave with no way out. Just the thought gives me shivers..

Now all they need is a study on how attractive they are.. 




 What was that last part? 




 Or the one of them in the nude hanging up at Michael's condo! 









 At first I was mad at the title of this post and was about to down vote, but the expression on that fucking dog's face...  




 Kind of an oaky afterbirth. 
























 Yup, that's interesting I've never noticed that my dailies are missing it

 And imagines that there is a giant groundhog looking at him through a microscope somewhere in space. 




 That situation you are describing, is not one I am familiar with. 
























 I would say 99 of the "benefits" people experience are placebo.

 OP has gone crazy, this could never work. 









 Same thoughts exactly. The OS on mine is still as fast as when I bought it, but lacking basic apps like Netflix make it hard to use as a daily tablet. 




 Wow that's a great idea, thanks! 




 I have an old BlackBerry playbook kicking around from when they were all the rage. As I recall they were pretty much useless, but does anyone know of anything I can use one for besides an expensive alarm clock?  




 Thought it was sped up until my third time through when I realized no one else was moving fast 
























 Exactly, the newsfeed is just full of stuff that was on reddit two days ago anyway.

 Just curious, why would you reset your counter after a wet dream? Isn't the counter just for time since last PMO? 




 Curious as well.

 Not my idea,  but in a thread a while ago, someone said that they stop and think about all the negative emotions and how bad they feel directly after PMO, whenever they are tempted. I've been trying this, and it honestly does bring you down from those euphoric feelings that accompany looking at P.  




 Could you see the other passageways branching off as you went down? Also any pics from inside the well? 




 Name checks out 




 I don't know why people are down voting, this is an amazing idea. 




 Shrooms/LSD may also work 




 Love it. 




 Wow, one of the coolest experiences I've read. 




 Apt 
























 Yeah :(

 What does the trigger do? 




 Is your badge correct? 




 Yeah I know, little confused as well. It mentioned Manga but I don't think that its porn. 
























 No the steak should be fine. 




 I see no problem. 




 Who forces a child to ride a mechanical bull anyway? 




 Suck on this. 




 Ethics matter I think  




 Can confirm. 









 Fuck on for better results 
























 Hahaha "Sorry we're out of decaf, do you want some gay?" 









 If I had a dollar for every time I saw this reposted... 




 So pretty much just shoving food down their throat?

 Kenny vs Spenny 









 The sun and all other stars are in effect thermonuclear bombs. If they get heavier than about 10 times the mass of the sun they eventually blow up as a supernova, so there is a limit to the size but it's a lot larger than anything we will ever build.
