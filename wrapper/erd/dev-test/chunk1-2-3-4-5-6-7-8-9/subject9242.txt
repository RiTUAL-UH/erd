 I just found out at 22 I was the child not of my father, but instead of my mother and a sperm donor who had Croatian citizenship at the time (the procedure took place in New Orleans in the early 90s if it matters). 

I automatically had American citizenship at birth by being born of an American and by being born in America, but now that I suspect I could get Croatian citizenship I am very interested in acquiring it. 

The Croatian bills regulating it suggest you need to settle the matter before you are 18, yet I did not know of my true origin. 

Also of note, I am not sure if he fled as a refugee in the 1990s, and I know a lot of the laws are different and written with the aim of resolving stateless citizens, so I am not sure if I could inherit citizenship if he was fleeing refugee wise. 

I should have access to proof of my origin via the fertility clinic, so is there a possibility of getting citizenship?  

I will link the relevant text of the Croatian legal code. 

The gentleman in question likely signed away the kinds of rights in regard to actions such as child support or whatnot, but I doubt that still includes the ability to confer citizenship. Is that the case?

I am older than 18 and not on the register of Croatian citizens, so I have no idea what to do and I presume this will involve a fair amount of paperwork even if I find all of the documentation. 

Thanks in advance.

 How?  Bernie Sanders has an economic platform that benefits groups in poverty, which are disproportionately African American and Woman American. 

By teaching people how voting Bernie Sanders will vote themselves money via common sense middle class economic ideas, like raising the minimium wage and expanding social security, Bernie Sanders can beat Hillary Clinton. 

It is just a matter of educating and teaching people why voting for neoliberalism never works.

 Agreed. I don't think he will run, and if he does he will be competing for HRC voters, not those of Bernie Sanders.

Glophosphate (roundup) DOES have legitimate concerns about overuse and the ubiquity with which it is applied, but it isn't dangerous in the sense that something like lead is. 

Glyophosphate only lasts for like a few hours before it denatutes and becomes harmless, it isn't something that would harm you if someone sprayed it on your food a week before it was harvested. And it isn't sprayed soon before harvest, so a lot of the baseless concerns seem to be ridiculous.

 What is fucked is that the elderly/"low income" people get these sweet apartments subsidized, and middle class or like 80 percent of the country get fucked. 

The luxury condos often are allowed to be built at a higher density if they have a portion that is below market rent. Now this goes beyond the federal affordable housing programs, and makes rhe upper middle class responsible for housing the urban poor,which is controveral in the firdt place. It is like taxing your home. 

What it also does is upbids and increases the price that the middle class has to pay, as there are even larger blocks of people who are taking up housing stock at a subsidized rate. 


Really I think zoning needs to be relaxed in many places to promote infill, smaller units, multifamily, and independently managed apartments. 


It is most profitable to only do luxury units because they make more money and have more stable clients, so when the government puts a bunch of red tape on a market that has little interest in it, it is pretty damn hard. 


I wish we had more unconventional housing in odds and ends,  on top of buildings, multistory, housing connected to workplaces and the like. 

Europe has a lot more housing like that, but instead we have our workplace/entertainment/housing rigidly seperated thanks to zoning in most places. My large street where I lived a while back had no food/gas on the whole street because all of it was zoned residential, and it seemed like such a clusterfuck not to have those amenities. 

Even the rental market is heating up a good bit, but there are so few units vacant and new ones are at a higher price point, so many people don't save money doing it. 

I will likely just get roomates well into my future as a young professional and invest the saved money. 

I will not pay 1450 a month in rent plus utilities and comcast to boot. I am more than happy to share a washing machine and actually keep my money. 

If housing prices weren't artificially subsidized by the mortgage interest deduction, the deductability of taxes on a house, and artificially low interest policies/zero interest rate policies, the value of homes would fall back into equilibrium. Somethinng like a lower multiple of average yearly income than where it is now.  




 A lot of communities that are older fear too many kids will raise property taxes, which fund schools. Having only seniors move into their city/neighborhood can in theory save a little bit on taxes in the short term, but really hinders the region. This kind of thing forces young and middle aged people to commute from further out if they are going to work a job. 

It really is discriminatory and needs to be cracked down on. It is highly ageist.

 Getting a roomate he basically knows he will make 500-1000 a month. Getting a mortgage for another property would add debt and the liability of taking care of the house, and what happens if real estate values decline and the house becomes underwater?

I just mean getting a roomie is by and far the most simplistic solution with little downside relatively speaking.

 Dad already has a house. A much easier solution is either moving out somewhere cheaper and renting the house, or getting a roomie for his current situation.  




 Stop the double payment, pay the minimum, and put that money that your dad had been putting extra into the mortgage into an IRA or other savings vehicle 




 How many rooms does his house have?  This may sound silly, but getting a roomate for a few years would give him a lot more cash flow and cut his expenses on things like utilities in half.

 Even a lot of the formerly good second tier cities are appreciating too much to make them a good value.

 Do what you have to do to survive. How many beds/baths is your place?  

I plan on either buying one of the few "entry" level homes for 130k and living in one bedroom while I rent the other.

If you and your wife life in a relatively large home/condo, getting a roomie may be a wise move. Even in a year or two you will have saved a bunch of cash without more hours at work.  




 Exactly. Even if you get one and it appreciates, unless you get a bunch of roomies and charge through the nose in rent, the taxes/HOA will eat you alive. Unless you sell, in which case you no longer have somewhere to live. 

But you might make a handsome profit.  




 One word. 

Bernie Sanders for President.  




 And consider that they may never be able to buy into the market like boomers did. People in nyc/sf/portland where the prices may grow 3/4 percent yearly mean that their income, even high ranking nationally, may not keep pace with prices.  A lot of people in these cities bought decades ago when homes were relatively inexpensive in comparison to income.  




 It is like any big industry. Buy up all the market and make the rules so nobody can enter the market and raise barriers to entry. 

Blackrock did the same on a national scale, buying up massses of rental properties.

Would something like this be too crazy?  The rest of the family doesn't want a pond in the yard.  I will keep the stocking rate something healthy for the fish, and I think in reality it could provide a very safe and healthy environment.

 The situation of owning a home.

If you can get a decent differential between renting out your main place and renting an efficiency, it can be a pretty sweet arrangement.

I know that couple, and even though they do not need to do that because of fiscal hardship, it is still a really great way to monetize their home.

Just look at how much your house would rent for vs how much you could rent a one bedroom for.  

I know you live in a cheap COL area, but I know people that are grossing an extra 2k/month from this if they have a nice house.  That would give you a lot more cash flow and equity on your home, even just in a few years.
