 Some "normal" protagonists have negative qualities that make them more foolish than "normal". Which protagonists do you think are "perfectly normal"? 




 [Ri Akitoshi](http://myanimelist.net/character/68553/Akitoshi_Ri) in Area no Kishi is Korean. (Ri is the Japanese pronunciation of Lee.)

Kim Daesun, who appeared as an opposing player for Tsujido Academy, is also Korean. His name less Japanized than Ri's, although both live in Japan. 




 Have you disliked an adaptation for diverging from the original? Have you ever thought that a significant change from the original made an adaptation better?

 Do you tend to like anime based on likable characters? A good message about life? Great animation quality? Enjoyability? Or something else?

 Just so I'm clear, I'm not asking for the most painful way to kill off your least favorite character. I'm asking what are good ways for a character to exit a show permanently.

Tag spoilers, of course. 









 I'm thinking of picking up Banks' Culture series. Do you recommend it as a must-read, or as an OK series, or not at all? 




 What books made you happy or euphoric (not amused or laughing) to have read them?

Some books that I liked are:

* The Stranger, by Camus
* The Unbearable Lightness of Being, by Kundera

I'm not looking for any horror, tragedy, or romance books, though.

 What did you use for making the map? 




 What did you use to make the map? 




 There are some long-running manga that either:

* Drags the main story to run as long as possible
* Starts new arcs that are not related to the beginning of the manga

What are manga that:

* Has a clear beginning, middle, and end
* The end is concludes the story from the beginning
* Doesn't drag 




 For anime that have a remake or a second adaptation, do you watch the original/first adaptation or the remake/second adaptation?

For example:

* Space Battleship Yamato
* Sailor Moon 




 And why do you keep watching it? 




 To be a good cross-genre novel, does it need to portray each genre well separately, or does it result in a wholly different genre than the parent genres? 




 And if so, what is the best example that you know of?

 Compared to other artists or groups. 




 The antagonist should be an individual, not a group or a concept. 




 For those who write fiction, how do you choose names for your characters? Names of people you know? Names with relevant meanings? Or names that you think sound good? 




 What novels have you read which made you least likely to think some passages could be cut without impacting the story? 




 Not necessarily *blind* optimism, but opposite of cynical.

 I'm getting tired of the usual cliches, so I'm looking for new ones. 




 I want to watch a movie with my younger brother. I can't watch R-rated movies with him (and he won't watch them), so I need to go below that. I would like to watch something that's intelligent or emotional this time, not really dependent on action.

We've already watched: E.T., A Beautiful Mind, Jurassic Park. I think we've both watched Spider-Man. 


































 Inverse of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/39ze0v/what_bad_anime_has_excellent_source_material/), because I'm not interested in reading good source material. 



























































 I want to watch or read anime reviews in which the reviewer is able to pick out what made the show problematic. *Not* a tirade or rant about how terrible it was. Any anime is fine, preferably well-known ones. 














 Four women are in the middle of town in bikinis, and all the men comment on how cool and strong they are. 









 Any soundtrack that both:

* Fit the anime so well that without the soundtrack the anime would be terrible
* Isn't so obtrusive that it overwhelms the reset of the anime? 




 Are there any good examples of an anime that has conflict but no evil villain? I don't like how some characters are evil for the sake of being evil. 




 Are there any good examples of a manga that has conflict but no evil villain? I don't like how some characters are evil for the sake of being evil. 









 If there can be OP characters, can there also be UP characters? 




 You love your favorite anime, but is there any part that was cliched? What would the anime be like if it somehow was able to remove that part? 




 A lot of anime have beach episodes (or pool episodes), hot springs episodes (or public bath episodes), and christmas episodes (or valentine's day episodes). What other staple episodes are there? 




 What novel had character motivation and emotion shown well and driving the story?

 Which anime has a good atmospheric and exciting soundtrack? 




 Television and film have a lot of things that novels don't, like the actors' portrayal of the characters, the cinematography, the soundtrack, etc. What do novels have? 




 Not "plot", but plot.

A good non-anime example for me is *Arrested Development*, mainly due to how the narration ties the different plot points together. Is there anything like that in anime? 




 Thank you, and [may](https://web.archive.org/web/https://i.imgur.com/KAk3PDW.png) [the Stu](https://web.archive.org/web/https://i.imgur.com/iXqzR9j.png) [be](https://web.archive.org/web/https://i.imgur.com/prp74Qd.png) [with you](https://web.archive.org/web/https://i.imgur.com/crJcSZh.png). 




 I guess AniChart is succinct, but to the point. 




 I use the synopses in anime previews in deciding whether I want to pick up an anime.

Here's Steins;Gate from [AniChart](http://anichart.net/archive/spring-11):
 
 Steins;Gate is set in the summer of 2010, approximately one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head, in Akihabara.
 
 
 
 Steins;Gate is about a group of friends who have customized their microwave into a device that can send text messages to the past. As they perform different experiments, an organization named SERN, who has been doing their own research on time travel, tracks them down and now the characters have to find a way to avoid being captured by them.
 
 
 
 (Sources: VNDB, Wikipedia)

From [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate):

 The eccentric mad scientist Okabe, his childhood friend Mayuri, and the otaku hacker Daru have banded together to form the "Future Gadget Research Laboratory," and spend their days in a ramshackle laboratory hanging out and occasionally attempting to invent incredible futuristic gadgets. However, their claymore is a hydrator and their hair dryer flips breakers, and the only invention that's even remotely interesting is their Phone Microwave, which transforms bananas into oozing green gel. But when an experiment goes awry, the gang discovers that the Phone Microwave can also send text messages to the past. And what's more, the words they send can affect the flow of time and have unforeseen, far-reaching consequencesconsequences that Okabe may not be able to handle...

 Have you read any novels just for the [wish-fulfillment](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment) value rather than to be enriched? 




 I'd like to know if you know of any novels that are introspective where you really get to know what the main characters are feeling, but preferably without someone suffering from physical conditions, mental conditions, or tragedies, or being a coming-of-age story. Ending on an optimistic note would be a bonus. 




 I keep reading that being introverted is not the same thing as being shy, but most examples I come across are when one is introverted but not shy. Is it possible to be shy and not introverted?
