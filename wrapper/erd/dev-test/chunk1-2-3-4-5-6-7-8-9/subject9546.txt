 That's not it at all... it's the quality of the match not the rub from just being in it, or the decision.  Good matches are happening and people are talking about them, and all the people involved. 




 I liked that quick jab at the beginning of the match when they were circling.  That screamed heel to me and the announcers played it off like it was a veteran move. 




 You do realize that Cena is going out there and saying what he is scripted to say, right?  He isn't just going out there and making it up on the spot. 




 You also have to remember that Kane is:

a. Older than he used to be so he can't take as much punishment
b. Not the same character as the guy who used to no sell chair shots

I get it if you have issues but make sure they don't make you sound like you are looking for reasons to just hate on Cena  




 Bring Back Funaki! 




 Brie once caught Nikki and Cena fooling around and yelled out "Come on Nikki!"  




 I hate that but I hate the Architect moniker more.  Hands down the worst moniker in recent memory for me. 




 The outcome isn't what matters... it's the quality of the matches.  He is putting on quality matches with each of his opponents.  We have gotten to see his go against a variety of opponents (Barret, Kane, Zayn, Neville, Stardust) and make them all look good as well as making the title look like something worth fighting for. 




 That was the other one that I was thinking of lol.  It was a toss up for me on which was worse. 




 Lawler vs Michael Cole at Mania 27 




 Bring Back Funaki! 




 Drew Carey... wait? 




 Top rope and springboard finishers are more of a face thing.  Having it be just part of his move set doesn't make it as much of a face move. 




 Couldn't even link the music huh? 




 I just like how fickle the wrestling fans are.  Before this documentary airs, people were hating on Rose so much saying how crappy his character is and how he should be part of the spring cleaning releases and whatnot.  Now this show airs and people flip flop to nothing but praise for him.   




 And New Day Smocks 




 I actually have no issue with the direction and the character.  IF you actually pay attention his feuds do have meaning to him as a character. 




 Yup because then you get this lol 




 There's no point in chanting his name when he is not there or mentioned.  It only takes away from the show that is going on.  I get he is missed; I miss seeing him too, but we don't need it being a distraction from the show going on. 




 Jericho looks like [Bon Jovi](http://www.m80radio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jonbonjovi_055horizprintwweb.jpg) 




 Abyss disappeared and then out of the blue his "brother" showed up looking for him.  After a while he started wrestling but wasn't much good at it.  Then on occassion he would get busted open and he would snap showing Abyss tendencies (i.e. using his moves like the Black Hole Slam).  This started happening more and more to the point where people caught on that he had a "split personality" and was really Abyss the whole time.  Joseph Park was his way of dealing with getting away from his violent lifestyle.  Then if I'm not mistaken it wasn't split personality but just Abyss pretending to be his own brother. 




 We'd have Rollins, Ambrose, and the fat guy 




 Austin's neck from the Owen piledriver, Bret Hart's head injury from the Goldberg kick 




 Big Dick Johnson 




 Rush featuring Bubbles and I'm sold 




 I think someone missed his nap today 




 That is no way to respond to someone who is legit excited and curious. 




 Same thing roughly but with Limp Bizkit's Rollin lol 




 I like the Dick on the hood...nice touch 




 If it is true... I feel so bad for him 




 Eh... not so much lol 




 That was my favorite part.  All this commotion going on and Ambrose is just off in his own world doing his thing moving thje table and chairs.  Then they all just look at him and he is like "What?"  That is the Ambrose that is so great. 




 I can never grow tired of watching that spinning cross body.  That is one beautiful move.

 It was intended to look like he threw all his weight against Taker to squish him into the steps.  It also helped explain why he was limping a bit during the match (in reality I believe he sprained his ankle earlier that day) 




 Yeah I remember hearing something about that... when done the way it was intended it works, but otherwise it just looks dumb.  And then you get moments like [this](http://i.imgur.com/QwFNEP2.gif) lol 




 What, no love for Smackdown's #1 announcer.... [Funaki!](https://whatistheexcel.com/wooobooru/_images/1bb03fc0d660984cffcd3cf4ec712778/1460%20-%20funaki%20pointing%20wwe.png)

 I liked Kevin Thorne but honestly preferred Mordecai more 




 Haha I knew someone would go there.  I was thinking of Pirate Paul, but part of me feels like Incest Paul could get over with the NXT audience too, but that would ultimately be more of a TNA thing lol 




 Kizarny or Paul Burchill 




 Jason Reso and Adam Copeland 




 So I have a sub that I created but my only mod for it was deleted.  IS there any way to access the mod controls for that sub?

 Let's Light It Up! 




 Although Jerry's face is priceless, I am enjoying the look the German announcer is giving her butt lol (it's the one third from the right) 




 I have noticed in the past few weeks, that the backstage agents are getting a lot of tv time, between breaking up fights (usually the refs do this) and other moments (Joey Mercury talking to HHH about his decision last week).  Do you think there is something more to this?  I can see them turning into H's goons a-la how McMahon had Briscoe and Patterson.  Thoughts?? 




 Nothing beat when H said... "Is that a hybrid?" 




 It's because in storyline, Brie is not employed, just a fan.  So a talent or authority member hitting a fan is bad 




 I like where this is going...however it felt very awkward and rushed. 




 I know huh!  It's like they were trying to escape from each other lol 




 The 619 part is just blah for me.  I loved when he hit the West Coast Pop though, because that looked amazing 




 Any move where you can hit it out of nowhere (i.e. RKO, Bull Hammer, Superkick, WMD, etc) 




 IT was most likely in TNA.  Bully Ray vs. Ethan Carter the Third 




 technically I don't think it's too much of a wrestling move, but the kip-up is something I always loved to see.  Back when HBK would do it, or the Rock after a ddt.  The last person to use it in quite a while is Daniel Bryan, but more people should do it. 




 His dancing on the announce table last night was awesome... the reactions of JBL, Cole, and Lawler were priceless, expecially JBL 




 Zack Gowen 




 Because he is allergic to maple syrup 




 I agree...it really set him apart from everyone else, which is a good thing.  In hindsight, did it really do anything to help his standing?  No...but that's the way it goes sometimes. 




 TNA has lost any and all "prestige" they ever had after systematically ruining their product over the years. 




 Well Finlay did shove him when Reigns was in the corner, so honestly that could have "storyline" made him angry after that fight with Kane 




 Are you serious??? 




 Woo Woo Woo...you know it!

http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s569/Frank_Boris/zack_ryder_zpsa30c2467.png 




 I like his gimmick a lot, especially now that he is starting to show more of the heel side.  That being said, I hate his damn face so much and want to punch him in it lol, so I guess he is doing something right. 




 I always thought it stood for Damien Death Tackle, in honor of his snake Damien 




 The rope rebound clothesline that Nigel McGuiness does and Dean Ambrose's one he does in tribute always look amazing. 




 Any kind of piledriver (with the exception of Kane and Taker's Tombstone), GTS (unless Punk comes back lol) 




 It is going to be the Wyatts...it will just take some time.  The Usos deserve a long title run not only because they worked their assess off to get to this point, but because it adds legitimacy back to those titles. 




 We're a Two and a Half Man Baaaaaaaaaand!!!!!!!! 




 Which diva is going to be the next to be Santino's love interest now that Emma is gone? 




 My buddy said he saw a wrestling action figure that is wearing a black suit, has one finger pointing, and in the other hand there are contracts or papers that say WWE on them.  He has no clue who the figure is of.  Does anybody out there know who it is? 




 The idea behind it was great in my opinion.  It got some good heat on Rusev and Lana, but something was missing.  MY question is why didn't they have anybody interfere and disrupt the ceremony?  They could have had Big-E come in and lay out the "ministry officials" and cut a great promo on being American and not backing down from the Russian.  But this is just my opinion, what do you guys think? 




 Can anyone make a gif of Big E and Rusev waving their flags at each other from last night's Payback?  If not, then does anyone have the footage of this happening?  Thanks.

 But reasoning changes and they can very well change their minds on certain talents that they have previously said no to.  They can also bring in older guys like they have with Rhyno or Kendrick to give a little boost to the star power there and give these up and comers established wrestlers to work with. 




 "It's time to clean the plates!" 




 What am I supposed to be looking for?  Every match listed [was announced last night](/spoiler) 




 By bringing in more big named indie talents to have those names as well as the normal development guys.  They have people like Uhaa Nation, Samoa Joe, etc coming in 




 True... the right mix of main roster and NXT women's wrestlers will make for an amazing match.   




 Actually Naomi, Nikki, and Alicia Fox are all good in the ring.  They just get put with others that aren't as good which holds them back. 




 It is meant to be that they are going to go for a back body drop  




 I care 




 I get why they let him go,  but ken Anderson 




 Because they stopped him wrestling 




 Like the hhh trunks or the scsa ones 




 It's not a myth but it's not super common knowledge 




 Yup Patterson put it right in that son of a plumber's pooper 




 But it's THE MOST ELECTRIFYING MOVE IN AAAAAAALLLLLLL OF ENTERTAINMENT! 




 Vince and Pat Patterson used to spit roast Dusty Rhodes 




 Wow! Dick much? 




 Except for Cena if I'm not mistaken 




 Some say Puppet H is hitting it on Road Dogg to this day 




 That's not what I meant by protected.  I meant it's protected in that it is rarely kicked out of, with the exception of big matches (i.e. Taker at Wrestlemania matches) 




 Tombstone, Stone Cold Stunner, Rock Bottom.  Pretty much moves that only get kicked out of in big time matches 




 That is all this guy does when he posts and comments 




 You're an idiot... they are putting these guys in competitive matches with cena that showcase them and that they can hang with the top guy in the company.  You don't have to lose to someone to put them over.  Yes it can be done that way but it's not the only way.  But I don't expect you to take anything anyone says as legit unless they 100% agree with what you are saying so I guess I am wasting my time on a lost cause that is you. 




 Cum on Nicki!

 This is legit the one thing that I had missed last night that I wanted to see... thank you 




 aka a "Gassy Canadian" 




 Because it's TNA and they are a sinking ship.  They are just falling hard.  And now there is GFW which has grabbed guys like Sanada and they are on the fast track to being better than TNA in terms of a company that is run well and in having a better product.

 I agree completely 




 Don't be a negative nancy 




 The curbstomp in theory is a good move... it just rarely if ever looks good when he hits it.  The set up is never believable in that his opponents would never irl just sit in that position long enough for him to set up and hit it.  




 I like how you just make up some bs about him being put in a comic tag team.   You have no clue what will happen with his character so stop jumping to conclusions 




 I was a fan before that... a Rosebud Hipster so to speak lol 




 "WHAT THE FUCK IS A HI-DIDDLY-DO!"  "NED FLANDERS IS YOUR HOOKUP, HOLLAR IF YA HEAR ME!" 




 Between injuries and being at times too outspoken I think they feel they may not be able to rely on him.  And I wouldn't say he is excellent in the ring.  He is good, but not excellent.  He can sell very well which he has going for him. 




 I never said anything about wwe being better or tna's being better.   Tna women's wrestlers could be the best in the world,  but if they aren't given the chance to go out there and give it their all then it doesn't matter if they are there.  




 It's supposed to be a play on tna changing people's names when they come in.   so William pumpkin smasher is Billy Corgan of the smashing pumpkins who is now doing creative

 LOLCENAWINS exists because some jabroni online decided they would try to be cool and create something because they were upset that someone was scripted winning matches. 




 after I did... you just said it better 




 The underhook facebuster... simple enough 




 Wyatt has been getting feuds, solid promo time, and a Mania match with Taker.  That is thriving.  Reigns won the Rumble and faced Lesnar for the title at Mania and is still in the title picture.  That is thriving.  Rusev had an extremely long undefeated streak and held the US title and is having matches with the top dog of the company.  That is thriving. 




 It was intended to be because he was bad mouthing the authority and so they were cutting his microphone to stifle him 




 So the fact that we have so many talents from NXT thriving on the main roster means nothing?   
























 Hey I put SPOILERS in the title.  You know the drill with that. 




 I honestly have never been excited to see him come out because I know it;s always the same thing.  "I showoff!"  then gyrations, then he gets his ass kicked, oversells, does his # moves of doom, gets beat on more, and occasionally hits the zig zag 




 And that is what is wrong with so many viewers nowadays.  They feel they are entitled to whatever they want from the company.  They owe you nothing other than to put on a show a few nights a week. 




 stop...HAMMERTIME! 




 That Rusev is injured, and so is Sasha Banks, and that Brock Lesnar is returning, and all the other stupid repeat posts people have been making all day long...

 I'm saying everyone has the right to post what they want on this sub given it is within the rules of it.  And the last time I looked fantasy booking was not prohibited on here.  And once again let me say that you chose to read this post even though you knew going in you were going to be negative about it.  And you offered no criticism other than saying you hate how people make these posts.  Instead you could have just kept your mouth shut and commented on other posts that are on the sub that "fit the mold" of what you think should be posted here. 




 You are a miserable one aren't you?  Who gives a shit if someone wants to fantasy book a match?  It has no bearing on you or your life.  You can easily tell by the title of the post that it is someone's fantasy booking and yet you still read it and why?  To just be an asshole to someone else?  I really wish this subreddit had a "no being an asshole to people who make a fantasy booking match" rule.

Bo: OK 




 Who let Steiner post in this sub? 




 I do like how they have had guys that take the US challenge kick out of it the first time, because it adds to how important that match for that title is. 




 True, but even when he wasn't just in big matches, it wasn't a move that would be kicked out of regularly.  But yeah I get what you're saying 




 And a downvote for you because you just had to say something lol 




 He got too drunk off of Steiner Screwdrivers and forgot his password 




 Tombstone... rarely kicked out of unless it is a big time match. 




 Ryder and Henry would be better... That's What I Woo Woo Woo! 




 He could always answer the open challenge.  A feud between him and Cena would be a breath of fresh air. 




 I know Gail Kim does it all the time in TNA and I believe she used it when she was in WWE both times but I could be mistaken 




 Reminds me of the movie [Daylight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_%28film%29) 




 Rated straight 




 Here we see Andy Levine, bagging groceries at a supermarket.   




 Apart from the Show thing he has been in title contention and in the main events and main even feuds.  I think the big thing is that he is coming into his gimmick more naturally now than when it was him doing vince promos every week. 




 Reddit does not ever stay on something for long without flip flopping.  Remember how much hatred there was for Reigns on here before Mania?  It was to the point where people wanted him fired and legitimately injured.  Now the hatred is so much less. 




 **Glass Shatters** 




 HE does matter... or else he wouldn't be getting promo and match time.  He wouldn't be getting feuds, he wouldn't fight Taker at Mania. 




 Sabin, Shelley 




 Uhaa, BReeze, Joe, Becky, Bailey, Enzo/Cass, Dubstep Cowboys 




 Joemoa Sam 




 Technically there was a point in TNA when Rhyno's character changed to this drunk alcoholic.  But that isn't really too much of a gimmick change 




 People worrying about his name being Owens now and I'm just sitting here wondering why Armbar is just armbar and not steen-alized? 




 But what about DX's tanks? 




 Hardy may not have gotten injured... he just had his other issues 




 It is really funny how absolutely true this is. 




 I have a theory on this... every time someone asks where he is, he is kept off TV a month longer.  That is why he will never be back on TV. 




 True... it was just Nash booking himself to do it that was the big issue 




 But they are already an established tag team that has beaten many teams.  Would you say the same thing if the Dudley's reunited at the same time, or if ShowMiz did, or Rybaxel? 




 And PTP do?  They have had a bunch of vignettes and that's it apart from the run in last Monday 




 Everything has come to life! 




 Nash ending Goldberg's winning streak 




 No I get it... I can't stand either because they both look so horrid to me.  But I guess if I had a choice it would be Spam lol 




 Wait, you'll eat Vienna Sausages but not Spam?!?! 




 Kevin Dunn and Vince Russo are now running NXT 




 Me no likey Cena.  Me never happy with anything.  Wah for you.  I and many others are not stupid and actually realize that things are changing.  You just need a reason to hate on Cena because you think it is the cool thing to do. 




 Vader... yes he works stiff but he is big, bad ass, intimidating, and surprisingly agile for a man his size (i.e. [Vadersault](http://i.minus.com/imzGizT5nqOJL.gif))

 May 19th is Kane Day.  There was a storyline years ago about how something horrible happened to him on May 19th and there was this presence that kept reminding him of it.  An imposter Kane showed up mask and all and the whole thing culminated in Kane throwing the imposter out of the building and taking the mask.  Then nothing happened with it.  Decent build but horrible outcome.  

P.S. The imposter Kane was played by Festus/Luke Gallows/Doc 




 What Stephanie was really doing during her absence from TV 









 The closest thing I can think of is not so much doing it before hand but having to do it because they were locked in it and couldn't get out.  This was Bobby Lashley in the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember 




 The first one, only because it was so innovative and it saw the Return of Shawn Michaels.  Also I have to give the runner up to the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember because it was the first time with the whole weapons in the chamber pods thing. 




 January 23 - XPac 




 HEY! WHAT'S ZACKIE E DOING IN THE IMPACT ZONE!?!? 




 Santino... I mean he beat Umaga for the Intercontinental Championship 




  Literally no one today on the main roster uses the powerbomb in any variation.

not sure where in here you said the word "finishers"? 




 Rollins does the turnbuckle powerbomb in almost every match he is in! 




 Harper does a sit down powerbomb, Rollins does the turnbuckle powerbomb... 




 Woods is a tag champ right now, so no go on him.  Neville is feuding with Bo Dallas, Stardust is seemingly on his way to going back to Cody, Harper is back to teaming with Rowan so they will probably find a way to be in the chamber.

 People are going to hate you for liking a commentator, especially JBL 




 Not sure if anything was said in there but you may run across some major negativity about something that happened. 




 I hope you are just trying to make a joke 




 Overall, no.  Good moments here and there. 




 I agree to a point.  It is tough though because there are too many people out there that will like the bad guys no matter what and will not boo.  But yes, there needs to be a resurgence in the amount of heel tactics in matches like eye raking/gouging, cheap shots, low blows, etc. 




 In essence yes, you are giving them a reaction.  But, there is still a fundamental difference between booing and cheering.  Booing shows your disdain for a wrestler while cheering shows your support. For example, if Barrett is facing Neville and he hits him with a Bull Hammer, he should not get a standing ovation.  He should get a rousing chorus of boos because he is the bad guy. 




 The bigger problem is people cheering for the heels.  You are not supposed to cheer heels, you are supposed to boo them. 




 I know, it's just sucky to read when I have experienced the whole cancer thing with family members and then these people who hide behind a keyboard just make a mockery of a heartfelt thing from Cena towards a kid with cancer.

 You get my upvote  




 Wow you are a pessimistic piece aren't you?  He was in no way saying it was him and his catch phrase that cures cancer kids or anything like that.  HE said he goes out there and does what he does for kids like that to give them inspiration.  HE said that message is what kids in those predicaments should remember.  How does it feel to be a heartless a-hole? 




 What a [Fat Ass!](http://tinyurl.com/ohpgnab)

 Frig off Donny! 




 If Dean Ambrose were a fruit dessert made of oranges and shredded coconut and sometimes pineapple he would be Dean Ambrosia 




 My bad... it was on facebook which was a fuck up on WWE's part.  However, I don't get my definitive info from their facebook page, I get it form TV or their app where they say what's actually happening. 




 You do realize that this crowd was supposed to be a house show crowd right?  They had bought tickets for a house show and then it got changed to the special event.  It's not like this crowd was going into this as a real PPV crowd.  That is why it wasn't explosive at everything, as well as the fact that there were plenty of reasons to not be cheering their heads off. 




 It was never announced as a title match 




 It wasn't really that big of a deal.   Not like that one thing destroyed the match 




 Let's go Cena fight Owens fight 




 Become a mod then so you can change it 




 GFW is a much better choice for him, as is NJPW.  At this point it seems like TNA is a sinking ship.

 So him saying he hates how people apply the logic of them making blunders, after I said how they make blunders is somehow him not saying I said that? 




 Did I ever say I think that they are bad now?  No.  Did I ever say I am ignoring WWE's blunders? No.  So stop putting words in my mouth.  I was responding to why people are not fans of TNA.  I know WWE fucks up a lot and I don't like that either. 




 Not everyone, but a good proportion.  Most likely because they are poorly managed and squander every opportunity that they get.  They hire too many old guns from WWE and instantly make them the focal point instead of making new talent shine.  They have just made too many blunders when they could have easily done much better.

 I have no problem having her and Rusev break up... I just hate that they have to pair her with Ziggler.  It's the same thing that happens everytime, they have a female wrestler/manager and they put her with Ziggler when they want them to get liked or whatever.  It just seems that that is all Ziggler is good for anymore to WWE is guy to put divas with. 




 Look I like some of the dumb things in wrestling... but this is just stupid 




 And fans get mad when people say wrestling is fake lol 




 So if I get what you're saying, you think that by moving to some cheap reddit knockoff that all the drama will somehow stop? 




 So the fact that Rollins has won MITB, was given the title at Mania (1st time ever btw), paired with the biggest heel stable in the company, has held the title since Mania, and has been in the main event storylines means that Reigns is getting pushed more than him?  Hmmmmm.....

 I remember how he was a great wrestler which in my opinion should not be tarnished by what he did.  He was a bad person for what he did and for that he should not be remembered.  But to outright dismiss what he accomplished in the ring is dumb.

 I would be fine with this if I knew for a fact that it didn't lead to a stupid arm wrestling contest. 




 Gotta pay for the young talent in Jarrett and Vader somehow 




 If they are consistently booked well like they should be they will do good.  I just have a hard time seeing how TNA will keep them booked well.  I get this feeling like they just brought them back in to get a boost and to make people ooh and aah for a bit.  Once that wears off I feel they will fall hard, and be gone again. 




 Morgan and Hernandez started as mid card giants but then toward the ends of their respective times in TNA were rarely on TV because TNA was too busy with other things.  And TNA's track record with giving older guys way too much money to do way too little is horrible so there's no doubt they paid him a ton. 




 So they bring back two people who they completely fucked over in terms of giving them solid booking (Morgan and Hernandez), some guy that is so old and washed up that always just booked himself to win and people hate (Jarrett) and another old guy that they are probably paying way too much to do too little (Vader) and this show is somehow fucking great again?

Sister Mary turns and moans, "Oh God, mine does!!!"

 Gotta love how people still think that this is the idea of the commentators.  Like Cole is just doing this on his own.  Every time they do this it is because they are being told to from the back. 




 I'd like to see [Ayako Hamada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayako_Hamada) but with the TNA past who knows.  WWE does seem to be lessening the blocking of ex-TNA talent so this could happen.

 Well that was dumb on their part.  The F-5 is far more devastating than Rollins' Pedigree and HHH's too 




 Oh agreed 100%.  Enough injuries already lol 




 Same reason Cena did 




 I'd love to see him use the [Samoan/Rikishi Driver](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/1319227/rikishi-driver-o.gif) but that is even more dangerous than the Muscle Buster.

You mean like his character was when he started?  He was never a full pro-Russian character.  That was a subtle character change. 




 [You think you know my grin?](https://whatistheexcel.com/wooobooru/_images/19f7e9d31a5562a6d4940bb5c1673c9f/4857%20-%20edge%20grin%20wwf.png) 




 Not just the stories, but his actual matches too.  Same formula.  Show up, gyrate and slick hair back, point to self getting in ring, slight offense, get ass kicked, oversell, comeback (clotheslines, corner splash, neckbreaker, yeahhhhh!) more ass kicking, occasional Zig Zag outta nowhere, get hit with finisher and oversell).  I'm not saying he is horrible, just boring and predictable (same could be said about others, i.e. Orton, Sheamus, etc).  HE could be used better somewhere else like GFW or ROH or NJPW, although he would make far less. 




 Every single person that has had a longer than 5 min match with him in which they kicked out of the AA. 




 Owens has the mic work to help carry the feud, whereas Neville doesn't.  Plus Owens can also work and sell and be a legit badass 




 You must have a lot left in the tank 




 No problem... best of luck with getting the promotion all set up. 




 Wow...racist much? 




 I don't hate him.  I am just bored with him because everything he does is the same thing over and over.  And it's not just on him; he does what he is told to. 




 Personally I am a fan of technical and lucha.  That being said, the lucha guys/gals should not only have other same styled opponents, but they should have bigger guys to work with too (not all the time) 




 Quality announcers that will call the moves

Good mix of wrestling styles

 




 The best part is the ref's reactions 




 Because the KO punch is easier to hit on opponents of all shapes and sizes where the Chokeslam is not 




 I mean I was talking overall... not just this storyline.  But yeah this one is pretty bad 




 It's Tuesday which means I will be watching [Chopped](http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/chopped.html) 




 I hope so... he has become so boring and disinterested.   




 So has Sting....

See I can do it too!

 I honestly didn't mean for it to be really negative.  More just frustrating because I want to pick one but the other is the overall better option lol 




 I can imagine... tough thing with brackets 




 Some of those matchups were stupid... Stone Cold or Christian?  Christian was awesome but you can't compete against Stone Cold.  Lesnar vs Mickie James?  Wow I wonder who wins that one lol.

 There is a big difference between speaking in a taped and edited backstage segment and speaking live in front of a crowd.  He needs to work on his live promo stuff, just because he really hasn't had much in the way of that. 




 frig off Mr Lahey 




 Can't be done... Kane run-ins are great 




 1.  Crappy WWE logic

2.  This question gets answered every single week.  He is under the ring.  When they play video packages and the arena is dark, ring crews come down to work on things and Bray dresses like one and then slips under the ring.  Lights go out...come back on...and there he is 




 So you conveniently ignored the highlights of his time after and focused solely on the bad parts just to further your argument.  That is fucked. 




 Dislike because he was one of the worst/most boring characters/personalities ever in the company.  Great wrestler though. 




 It was Seth Rollins overcompensating to make sure J J and Kane are on his side.  Chickenshit heel tactic to suck up to the people that "protect' him. 




 So we're ignoring his tag title run with Kidd?  So yeah you are ignoring things to shit on it.  And the plans have changed with Cesaro because he was doing tag stuff.  Now Kidd is out and he is doing single stuff.  So your logic is fucked. 




 You're just looking for reasons to shit on this 




 How is he ruining them?  By using them?  Sounds like the stereotypical "me no likey Cena" person to me 




 If the rumors about him leaving are true than this is WWE's way of making him look horrible on his way out. 




 Peanut butter and jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaammm!!!! 




 **ahem** Chokeslam from Hell

 That Becky Lynch armbar is pretty nice 




 I have no clue but it is fucking stupid 




 Sounds like the fans are to blame for where he is now.   




 I'm sure he enjoys it to a point.  Plus the $$$ is nice 




 I'd feel perfectly fine with it to be honest.  I wouldn't whine about it like you. 




 Ambrose 




 wow I can't believe yet another person is complaining about Stephanie. 




 FUCK FIN BALORRRRRRRRR! 




 It was one of his best... then I loved when the match started he just sat there contemplating almost like he was going to pull a Seven style promo where he would just drop the gimmick.  Then he snapped back into Stardust. 




 **fingers crossed** please be Zack Ryder 




 No it means they are joining another clusterfuck bandwagon that this site loves.  It just becomes the cool thing to complain about so everyone wants to do it to get karma. 




 Wow you are whining about the same thing hundreds of other have already whined about and made posts of on here.  You are a true original.
