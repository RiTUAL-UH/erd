 Whenever, already added you
 




 Appreciate!  




 Would you possibly be able to help me evolve my Seadra?
 




 Cool no hurry. Do you have perchance have Kyorgre?
 




 I can do a tradeback for Diancie  




 Awesome thanks man! I forgot about the tradeback.. super baked
*edit wait that wasn't even you... my bad....
 




 Cool cool, just out of curiosity what is it that the natures do? Sorry I haven't played pokemon since gen 2 prior to this game lol. 




 I have an Adamant Oshawott but my Fennikin is Naughty, is that alright?
 




 By sheer luck I actually have both of those in the few random extras I have bred!  




 [trade] I have all starters (all gens) and most of the Hoenn Pokedex. Also need a tradeback for my Seadra. Thanks! 




 LOL I have similar memories! 




 Hey sorry I went ark for a bit but if you're still around I could actually use one! Thanks.
 




 Thanks a ton mate! Really helped me out :)
 




 Whenever you're ready
 




 K just give me a bit to hatch it :) Sorry just multi-tasking up the waazoo right now lol
 




 Absolutely that's fine! I'll send over some random level 1's then.
 




 Sure just give me a few to breed an extra
 




 Thanks man! I appreciate it. :)
 




 added you! Don't see you on PSS though.
 




 Awesome thanks mate! What would you like in return?
 




 Thanks! Still after Lunatone, Seviper, Wigglytuff and Lileep. I think most of those are AS exclusive except the Lileep dual type fossil, which I took the opposite of.
 




 Phione takes foreeeever to hatch :P
 




 I can get you Kabuto I'd just have breed one real quick haha sorry! If time is no issue it's not a problem.
 




 For sure! I have an extra Tyrunt on hand, just gotta breed the Phione.  




 [trade] Alright so I need a bunch of pokemon for my Hoenn pokedex. I'm willing to trade pretty much whatever, I have almost all of the Hoenn pokedex minus this handful. I also have every starter from every generation.

Some other notables up for trade: 
Tyrunt
Anorith
Kabuto
Phione

Thanks :)
 




 Shit thanks mate! This was my first time participating in a giveaway and you my friend have made it tops! 
 




 Not even the weirdest thing about this picture.. 




 I would be willing to argue that most people here are actually aware that it's a blanket...you're kinda missing the point. 




 If it were a colour picture I bet it would look normal... just the contrast in black and white photos that makes things look unnatural. That said, this definitely belongs here. Weird photo composition as well, with her way out to the right of the frame facing away...  




 K then deposited. :)
 




 Okay, about to deposit a level 15 male Slugma. I can't gender lock, but I did level lock. Sorry i'm a noob to gts - do I need to fill in the pokemon wanted section? 




 aka every pokemon i'm not actively trying to catch. 




 Badass! The texture makes it seem almost as though it's made of stone. Either way, very good looking Blastoise!  




 I miss this emulator :( I updated iOS and now it no longer works. My FR team wuz the shit :( 




 Hmmm I just got all this free stuff from my loving family... I better go complain about it on the internet now. 




 Good to know man, glad to have you on my list :)
 




 None really come to mind, I'm sure there are lots but I only do a couple at a time, takin' it slowly.
 




 Thanks a lot man! Merry Christmas!
 




 k
 




 sure!
 




 thanks man!
 




 [trade] Yeah so I need a Lotad to help complete my pokedex. Going in systematic order now that i'm done the game. I do have every starter from every generation though if somebody wants one for the trade.  




 Because sleep is for the weak and I am an internet addict. True story.
 




 Thanks a lot man! Hopefully you'll be around when I finally get my Electrizer and Magmarizer :)
 




 [tradeback] Yeah so I basically just need help evolving these three via trade. If you don't have them already it will be for dex entries or if you do you could just help a fellow trainer out. The Clamperl will be evolving into Gorebyss.  




 Yooo sorry man I totally replied and then went and did shit thinking you weren't gonna be on! Anyway i'm around now. 




 Hey man sorry passed out last night, I still need a Chespin though if you're offering. What would you like in return? I have literally every other starter. (except Fennekin, have it but in a different game)
 




 Thanks for the trade man! Now all I have left is Chespin...that one will be tough haha. Not much love for that little guy.. 




 I added you, you still need to add me though so that it's mutual. Just enter in my friend code in the friends app and i'll initiate the trade, it's done through PSS 




 Kk I still need Oshawott, Got Froakie now
 




 haha sweet :) i don't even know what that is lol. I would have taken literally anything.
Thanks for the trade mate!
 




 damn how'd you lose your everstone?
 




 Nice third choice! :) Thanks for the trade mate.
 




 Can do :) have extras of all
 




 Cool sounds good, I literally just got froakie in a wonder trade hahah but yeah np just send over whatever along with the chimchar egg 




 Yeah man that would be great, and I can trade you all three of those of you want. They're all gonna be level 1 tho haha
 




 [trade] So yeah i'm looking to complete my Hoenn pokedex and I also want to get all the starters eventually so I'm looking for the ones mentioned in the title as well as Chespin and Froakie if anyone has em. Not picky about level or stats or whatever.

Can trade any of the original Gen I or II starters plus Snivvy, Piplup, Tepig and Turtwig. 

Thanks. :)
 




 I'm assuming it's done now... didn't get any but helped get a few new dex entries!
 




 Chances are i'll be sleeping by then but i'm not in a rush and if you're going out of your way to offer them free I can just wait until whenever's convenient for both of us. I'll add you tho 




 Yeah that sounds good, Try me whenever you're on, I'll probably be awake.
 




 for sure!
 




 gotcha. so in 15~min?
 




 Sorry i'm a noob to the Pokemon Reddit community, how do these work? 




 [trade] So i'm looking for Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander. I have for trade any of the following, bred from an egg level 1:
Snivvy
Piplup
Chikorita
Treecko

Also I have an extra ditto.

Thanks! 

Ps if you happen to have Totodile or Cyndaquil and want to trade for any of the above, that works too!  
























 ps your flooring is dope
 




 Nice one man! love the tv in front of the trainer lol. I have a similar setup for those long seshes! 




 You need to start living my friend
 




 I feel like this is when a large tv becomes useful
 




 Ayy you just read my mind. 




 I also think its more just to do with all the similar titles lately. Nice setup man!
 




 Alright, fair enough. He's not driving under their bedroom windows at night, I get that.

Just a weird teacher with some questionable social media practices.  




 At the basic level you are right: don't post shit you don't want others to see. But the issue here is more what an incredible display of unprofessionalism it is to monitor your students online presence unsolicited. And the fact that OP is clearly not aware of how negatively his actions are actually being perceived by anyone whose opinion is actually relevant to the scenario.  

 




 Wow nothing personal but I kinda hope you get fired. Sounds like you're not exactly cut out to be teaching kids when you yourself aren't finished being one.

You said you take "pride" in being in the know about your students, when in fact you are just monitoring their presence online without their permission or the official request of anybody. The fact that you admitted to needing to find out "who liked the girls ass photo" already betrays your creepy personal agenda.

Justify it however you want but you teachers who stalk students are the fucking worst. 




 I initially read it as a female teacher telling the story and still thought it was creepy as fuck. He literally applies the word "stalking" to what he is doing to his students. Nobody asked him to do that shit. At best he's well intentioned but needs to get a life, at worst he gets kicks out of following his students lives and still needs to get his own. 




 lol nice one! love the shadow being cast by your collectible  




 fuckin' dopee
 




 Seriously does it go back hundreds of years because of cultural tradition, or did it just start with a couple of furry animators and kind of snowballed from there?

I just find it so strange that bestiality is typically regarded as one of the most taboo forms of pornography, yet humans who dress and act (and in some cases even want to be treated) like cats are noticeably becoming more and more mainstream and acceptable, especially in Japan and amongst Japanese pop-culture enthusiasts. Why is this?
  




 Sometimes when I feel shitty about not going out I remember this is some peoples idea of a public outing and I feel much better. 




 Yeahhhh 




 lol ever heard of a bag?
you must be one of those dorks with saggy weighted down cargo pants
 




 just described my sleep habits
 




 lol I like how it's barren... Romans don't like snow

edit: nvm I think I see people just the resolution makes it hard to tell
 




 I feel like you haven't actually seen one then
 




 1   2 will always hold a special place in my heart. Still played 3 but didn't love it. Age of Mythology is still the shit too, bust it out a couple times annually for some comp stomp
  









 Club mate! luckyyyy. Can't get that shit at all in Canada. 
 




 Triple reddit?
 




 How do you run three monitors off of one laptop? is there any lag?
 




 I feel like shopping will never become 100% online because sometimes there are things you just don't want to wait for. I don't mind buying the odd jacket or whatever online but i'm not going to have a wardrobe shipped to me. If there are people like that out there that is weird..
 




 Here in Edmonton we still have ridiculously over the top malls. Case and point: West Edmonton Mall.  




 West Edmonton Mall is actually one of the few exceptions with a ton of attractions left. It still has an ice rink, amusement park, water park, arcade, iMax movie theatre, replica ship in the middle of a big flooded atrium that you can book for parties, and multiple mini-putt courses. Plus a hotel, nightclubs, casino, bowling and several sit-down restaurants. The only thing missing is a strip joint. But yeah besides that all our malls are pretty cookie-cutter. H M, VS, Starbucks, etc.

 Also idk why but I like chaotic battle stations like this as opposed to clean ones. Clean looks nice but also like they just moved into the room and then took the picture. I like a battlestation that's clearly been lived in and has evolved to fit the space rather than the other way around.  




 I'd love to have a tv parallel to the bed like that for those lazy mornings...
 




 I gagged
 




 Is the wife is cool with you splitting your time between your marriage bed and a gaming shack?
 




 Do you work at home? What kind of job would you need Rokit 8's for?
 




 My dream is to one day have enough desk space to have a perfect clean triple monitor setup like this....
 




 Those are some odd choices for discreet weapons
 




 I see a controller but no speakers o.o
 




 2 decks is so last decade
 




 So much asian in this pic
 




 Nice setup but it seems pretty spread out for live production 




 :(
 




 "make you" as in give you away. If someone undercover is "made" it means he's compromised. Poor word choice in hindsight.

 




 Back in the late 2000's almost every phone had terrible interference and sometimes you'd be sitting in class (middle school at the time) and when a text came through the radio interference would make you and the teacher would come take your phone away.. 




 I actually thought it was Felicia Day for a second... 




 Yo man your wife looks like Felicia Day... lucky guy.
*edit...Forgot this was posted in a sub specifically for women, assuming now that OP is in fact Felicia Day lookalike..
 




 Reminds me of "Sorry" a Wurmple I got from OT: Ashes Mom
 




 Sorry if this has already been posted and sorry for the quality of the video (There are newer uploads but the original is the only one with english subtitles - plus the shitty translation adds to the humour imo)

Anyways one of my earliest and best stoner memories is getting high for one of the first times and then stumbling across this video with a friend. Since we were both kinda nerdy we understood most of the references and sound clips, and it just made for an awesome random experience when I was young and new to the herb. Germans and I would get along apparently.  









 Alright cheers mate!
 




 Oooh yeah, that must have been it. I don't think you can get the primal evolutions in it and I had mine holding the mega stone. Want to try again? 




 Yeah not working :( says "There is a pokemon that cannot be traded in your party" even though it's not in my party in the first place. 




 Here lets try again, if it doesn't work i'll just send over whatever. Weird though, I literally just traded it  




 Weird it's not letting me trade him all of the sudden...
 




 Awesome! Last one I need. Any particular mon you want? 




 Thanks!
 




 Sounds good 




 Got it now, thanks for the offer though. :) 




 yup! Any dex entries you need in return?
 




 No, thank you! :)
 




 K sorry got distracted! Added you though.
 




 kk! Add you in a sec
 




 How do people usually go about doing that? Just let me know when you've caught it on here so we can do the tradeback after I guess.
 




 Sure man
 




 [tradeback] Yeah so i'm just looking for these last few to complete my dex. I've given up on a semi-living dex, just interested in having the little pokeball next to em' now.

LF: ~~Milotic~~, Huntail, ~~Rhyperior~~, ~~Jirchi~~, ~~Glalie~~, ~~Froslass~~

I have all of the OR exclusive legendaries and all of the starters available for dex entries. Thanks for the help! I could never have even got this far without this subreddit.

 




 I don't but if you still do I definitely could. Also I hate to be petty but I accidentally traded you my everstone lol
 
























 same here, dream-home material for sure
 




 sick reference 
 




 Genocide is the systematic elimination of a specific group of homogenous people who share a common characteristic. Not at all similar.

 Is this your first time dealing with human emotions? Fearing for our own mortality is a regular occurrence and has been for millennia. 




 Sorry, guess I'm unbalanced for being a little disturbed by the possibility of mass murder 




 I could see using a vertical monitor for plugins but it definitely doesn't make much sense for arrangement view 




 great selection mate!
 
 




 Very nice setup! Photo seems a tad bit contrived, like you're trying to show off all your cool hobbies at once. Or maybe you do just juggle producing, browsing, streaming and programming all at once. Either way cool rig man.  




 I kept holding out hoping for a less fucked up answer... but even I can no longer deny this seems like a mass murder/suicide :( 




 I've read more than a few comments to the effect of "I hope that scumbag murderer co-pilot rots in hell." Don't underestimate the ability some possess to rapidly condemn strangers to hell based on pure speculation.

Nothing wrong with harmless and educated speculation, but some definitely take it too far once they've made their premature opinion. 




 All these americans going "In the US we...." are soooo helpful  

 




 Cracked front windshield, cockpit depressurizes while the one pilot steps out, co-pilot starts emergency descent but then passes out in cockpit from hypoxia, pilot either can't get back in for whatever reason or does eventually get back in but then also passes out..plane continues unguided emergency descent into mountain
  




 There is still the possibility that even after the locked-out pilot regained emergency access, whatever incapacitated the co-pilot got to him soon after. Think about it... if it was a cracked front windshield causing depressurization leading to hypoxia like experts are now hypothesizing, merely regaining access to the cockpit wouldn't be enough to save the plane. It would likely just lead to more incapacitated people. 




 You're telling a recently deceased man to rot in hell before you even know he's guilty of anything? Fucked up dude. It still could have been lots of other things. Speculation now is that a cockpit windshield pane could have cracked, causing depressurization and knocking out those in the cockpit. 
 




 "Like exactly what I like or you're just a noob lolz"

Seriously though, I love Ducky but objectively, they aren't even well designed keycaps. The designer literally just made a bunch of jagged lines for the "cityscape" with the pen tool in Illustrator then plopped a monument or two in each depending on the city. And everyone still loses their shit over it. 
 




 Love it! Definitely reminds me of Unreal Tournament's soundtrack
 




 My other bike is a bike.
 









 Nice web, Mr. crackspider.  




 Sorry nooby question maybe but whats the thing on top of the Marshal? looks interesting
 




 nice man I figured from the setup you did something techno-y and your soundcloud didn't disappoint.
 




 B W filter and you've got yourself a Techno album cover 




 dude I looove these! 
 




 First thing I thought was PRIDE
 




 Korg Nanokey or MPK Mini's are great for le plane  




 Lots of classical music is what gets me. Stuff by guys like Ludovico Einaudi or Yiruma. Idk why..

I find the darkest of atrophic, nihilistic berlin techno to be more happy than that shit.

 




 Nice one man
 




 I'm a design student with limited extra cash for designer clothes (go figure) so I tend to wear a lot of plain, cheap dark clothes (plain black v's, drop crotch sweats, black slim fit jeans, black converse/high tops, dark scarves) and cheapish techy outerwear (think Superdry). If I had the money, I'd be decked out in DEMOBAZA, Rick Owens, and a Google Glass tho LOL..
 




 Edmonton, AB! New to this sub but long time lover of dark things so I feel right at home :)
 




 I think it's usually an indirect way of letting everybody know "I would have even more cool stuff if my money didn't all go to books/bars/subway"

At least that's why I would mention that i'm still in school.

 




 Soundcloud is the way to go my friend! Join a group or find a few artists you like and go from there. Most artists have contact/booking info right on their profile. It's really easy when you can see the likes of your favourite artist, just follow the trail to new stuff.

 




 oh Russia...
 




 nice but definitely not original. We actually learned how to use the pen tool recreating vector lotuses just like this at my school.  









 Woah! I've been using this as an avatar on a random music forum for years now. Cool to finally know the source. I think I originally found it on tumblr.

 




 Great photo! Made me hungry for some reason...
 




 Music producer and graphic designer... Wanna be my best friend? 




 oh yeah...wow, how about that?
 




 Love it :)
 




 more like hikikomori stations. The second last one made me laugh tho. Some 4channer eating frozen yogurt up in a crawlspace.  




 I lost it when I saw the calculator!
 




 Honestly probably not a whole lot, but they exist for the same reason luxury vehicles and $5000 suits exist. People like nice things. :)
 




 Oh man those are soo gorgeous.
 




 First thing I saw too
 




 zoomed in on the sticker set thinking it was something super cool..
 




 Also I LOVE the framed Starcraft race emblems!  




 I want to go PLP too but then i'd be covering up my monitors :( small desk/room problems..

Anyway nice setup, just made some student jealous ;)
 




 Hello, welcome to Gamestop....
 




 I love this! Simple and understated but you genuinely get the feeling that work gets done here. Not just another fap/anime station
 




 source? looks exactly like the kind of cheesy low budget cyberpunk films i've come to love so much.
 




 Are you afraid of it?
 




 didn't teach it any new moves hope that's alright
 




 I can help ya out!

 




 [item] Yeah so I just want to move my stone from my copy of X over to Ruby. Will trade it along with the charizard. Appreciate any help!  




 Great setup man! love the baman/piderman sticker haha.. nice touch.  




 Yeah until they realize how much fun it is to play MTG blazed...
 




 Nice! I was impressed and then I saw the pano and now i'm really impressed. I too hope to someday have a big 3 desk setup just like this for mixing, production and gaming respectively. Also I didn't know people stream their studio sessions on Twitch, good to know..
 




 all that beautiful desk space!
 




 Just imagining the possibilities if I had a desk that big..
 




 LOL I kinda got used to the hat for a while, since he could actually pull it off, but then back by season 4 I was like dude... enough with the damn fedora. He's dealing with the worlds most elite rings of thieves and he's dressed like a fucking Le Chateau mannequin. 




 I find the writing is consistently great and I love Neal and Mozzie, but the way they wrap up EVERY SINGLE episode with Jones and Diana busting in at the last possible second and then the "caught the bad guys" happy ending slow jazz track rolls out. I still don't even hate the endings, just hard not notice the pattern after 5 seasons..
 




 haha fair enough! I think tipping within Canada is different but yeah I could see the ones who go down for the winter on a budget tipping poorly. 




 I'm an apparently gullible Canadian and i'm genuinely curious as to whether you're serious or not.

 More of a techno goth. I think it was movies with alternative club scenes like Blade and The Matrix when I was little that really got the interests flowing.   




 Here's some stuff i'm into. I can't afford these particular brands so I settle for minimal, toned down versions of the look, but this is the kind of aesthetic I really dig.

 I disagree and personally hope this completely ruins her career. She straight up roasted that woman, that's the kind of shit that makes depressed people go home and off themselves. If only more rampant bitches were forcibly humbled like this maybe the world wouldn't be such an intolerable place for all us "regular folk." 

Not even on my worst day ever would I resort to that kind of language and behaviour, and i'm just a nobody college student not some professional whose entire image is based on public perception. If she was really half as smart and savvy as she's convinced she is she'd have never acted that way to anyone, ever..
 




 It's okay, I didn't know you could lock on to enemies until after Anor Londo
 




 I just meant if you're planning on starting the game on the trip 9 hours won't be enough to get anywhere in-game :P 




 9 hours - hah!

 Yeah i'm sure it's a good time, I'm not hating or anything just found it a little bit funny in my head.
 




 Yeah but meeting up to play videogames makes sense because you actually have something to do. :)
 




 lol I mean I love my mechanical keyboard but a bunch of people meeting up just to talk about and take pictures of their multiple keyboards cracks me up for some reason.
 




 Macbook Pro
 




 Yeah those dragonslayer archers are admittedly hard to get past, even if you know what you're doing. Also that fucking titanite demon in the cathedral one hits me even at 46 vit and full Havel armour in NG+ lol 




 First play-through I was having trouble up until Anor Londo. Then once I got to the big ol sunny city everything just clicked and I was taking out those giants and gargoyles like nothing. Farmed the painted world for little while and got a bunch of levels, got lucky and killed S O second try, smooth sailing from there on.

Now in NG+ I'm back in Anor Londo and S O are making me their bitch. 




 UP anybody? 




 play this every time by default
 




 Izalith. Fuck that titanite demon shortcut.
 




 I agree with pretty much the same things everybody is saying here. Dark Souls 1 is a more special experience in almost every way, the only thing DS2 has on it is updated graphics. 

The design, atmosphere, lore, combat, and overall consistency of DS1 is far better. 




 The Second Renaissance. It's a part of the Animatrix compilation. Short but well worth watching. I believe it's in parts on youtube. 




 holy fuck H M got a bigass sign now
 




 Behold, the great white towers of Detroith 




 love it, kinda reminds me of old Skinny Puppy. 808's all over each track and still managed to keep it deep and dark
 









 Also read up about the legendary nightclub Berghain. It's literally a standing temple devoted to hedonism and cheap overindulgence to this day. It  began as a sex club that happened to play music and evolved from there. It is what immediately came to mind when you described the sort of place you envision.  




 Anyone who plays the mainroom at Berghain. I recommend you check out some of the Reclaim Your City podcasts on SoundCloud to see if they fit your aesthetic. It's generally dark and future-industrial but still dancey club techno. It's the stuff the real heads are listening to, straight out of places like Berlin, Tokyo, Rome, etc. Idk if that's your thing or not, but I love it and I totally feel like it fits in with the whole cyberpunk aesthetic.

 Merely having billions of dollars is not my definition of a success. It depends what is done with it. And most people in the bracket we're discussing haven't done a thing to earn their fortunes anyways, most are born into it. (with obvious exceptions.)

I like Gates because he actually puts his money where his mouth is and donates the vast majority of his personal fortune to causes that benefit society. But this earth doesn't need more families like the Rothschild's or the Waltons, whether they admit it or not.  




 So you don't see the problem then, clearly..
 




 Nobody cares about the doctors taking home 400k for decent honest work. That's the American dream. 

It's the corrupt politicians who give their powerful friends breaks and enable the ultra-rich to get richer that people have a problem with. Sadly while being a billionaire is great, self made or not... you've gotta face the ethical qualms of having a personal fortune worth more than some countries entire GDP and still actively trying to get more.
 




 So you're not convinced there's a wealth gap at all because there's not a reliable source in the video to confirm it?

lol have you not seen rich people? have you not seen poor people?
 




 To most people it's not the doctors and lawyers that are the problem, but some of the more prominent politicians, bankers and CEOs who really make up the gross wealth gap. 

400k a year is still relative pennies to the super-rich "1%" (more like 0.0001% probably) who take home millions, in some cases billions a year. I say fuck those guys too.. nobody needs that kind of money in a lifetime.

As soon as I got close enough they were a piece of ez 
 




 I'm a melee knight and i'm rocking a Black Knight sword+5, which so far has been holding up great for the duration of the game (already went through Anor Londo with it). But when I go back to vs the Four Kings I virtually seem to do no damage. Do I need to use a transient curse or something? Or just find a weapon with magic damage? What do you guys recommend? I have virtually no INT..
 




 A good chunk of the world still has trouble feeding themselves.. This idealistic article fails to take into account that this technology will only be available to a relatively small percentage of wealthy people with expendable time and income, generally first world countries. Sure it's gonna be awesome for those who can afford it, but it's likely not going to stop any ideological wars in chaotic countries that don't even have adequate basics such as food, shelter, etc.
 




 Her ovaries just exploded

*scroll down.. see that jokes already been made in like 30 different ways
 




 Honestly all DJs have different styles and methods of mixing their music. Some mix straightforward, back to back with two decks. Some scratch or use creative use of effects. A hip hop turntablist is still a DJ, but the methods involved in mixing hip-hop are vastly different than say a 3,4 even 5 or 6-deck purist techno set with loads of loops and tools. 

Unfortunately, typically the bigger a producer DJ gets, the more he has to adhere to a specific sound, the one all the fans who started following him want to hear. That plus the insane logistical nightmare bigger shows have of lining up sets with lighting, fireworks, pyrotech, etc is what generally leads to more predictable "press play" type sets.

 




 If I had a dollar for every person i've heard say "DJs only press play" but couldn't tell me the first thing about what the mixer does...

Obviously there are fake/"unethical" DJs, but people act as though there's this race of magical mix-elves who pre record everything for the DJs and then they just have to go up on stage and hit play.  




 Sometimes it's better to stay underground with a dedicated and loyal following.
 




 You guys just made me sad :(

 How do you hook up your two external displays to that macbook with only one display port? I want an extra vertical monitor for reading but idk how to hook up a second one.

 I've been caught breaking the law (minor stuff like weed in public) three times now and every single time the cops let me off with a friendly warning. Always polite, never intimidating. I love Alberta cops.

 I recently read how as far back as Ancient Greece, philosophers have had theories about how reality as we know it could be an illusion, sort of like in The Matrix. How far back does this concept go and what caused humans to initially become skeptical of the world around us without any proof?

 goddamn that's exactly what I thought it was gonna be lol
 




 Yooo I want one
 




 Indeed, for me cyberpunk is more of an aesthetic than it is about the actual advances in technology! Until we get into cyborg territory that is. That shit is quintessentially cyberpunk.

 na dude particle board is super weak it was like an IKEA desk. 




 ah that sounds little too exploit-y, I just want some extra time to heal goddamn
  




 was it no bonfire?
 




 never the actual controller, but I had a particle board desk at one time until I "accidentally" put a few holes in it with the butt end of an xbox controller.
 




 yeah I fail at parrying and I'm stuck on him right now in NG+++

What's this pillar trick? :P
 




 As a heavy tank build I think Four Kings is probably the easiest boss in the game for me. If you get right up on them their hits only takes out like 1/15th of my health every time 




 I'm stuck on Gwyn right now on NG+++ and for some reason I just can't fucking get parrying down so it comes down to luck and rolling away in time to spam estus after staggering him..
 




 I finally picked up Dark Souls a few months ago and fell in love with it after hearing my coworkers rave about it forever. I'm now on NG+++ and about 150~ hours in. Haven't even gotten to trying multiplayer yet (on Xbox and don't feel like paying for live)

By contrast I picked up Dark Souls 2 SoFS after finishing my first playthrough of 1, played about 10 hours into it and quit. None of the things I loved about Dark Souls made it over to the new iteration. Working at a game store, I have met people who really love DS2 just as much if not more than the original, but I find the overwhelming majority of people say Dark Souls was definitely a more impactful game.

 Finally getting to Bigtits room and acquiring the Lordvessel is by far one of best feelings in the game.
 




 Yeah it's waay harder to kill Smough first! Every time after my first play-through  i've attempted to kill him first because I want Ornsteins set (NG+++ now) but every time I end up giving up and killing Ornstein first because I just want the damn lord vessel already. 




 Alright so I'm mostly a house and techno guy but come on who the fuck doesn't like hip hop?

Anyways i've been wanting to round out my rap collection as of late and my question to this sub is what are some of the must-knows of the digital rap world? What are the best places to keep up on both news and releases? 

I love to digitally crate dig and find new music; I know iTunes is usually the go-to place to actually buy the music but sometimes I prefer the more curated sites, ones usually run by the real heads in the scene. Any advice would be much appreciated.  




 omg I love this sub
 




 What he said ^
 




 Tough choice, both nice boards. I also kind of want a wasd with a little less loud switches haha. 




 ^ me on an alt
 




 lol ya
forgot to crop it out
 




 No I don't think so, Gold serpent ring would help though.
Sometimes I play a game where I take a hit every time I die... almost passed out trying to beat S O
 









 lol I still use BKS+5 as my daily driver 3 playthroughs in. I'm a str build tho so it scales well, out-damages all of the boss soul weapons save for Artorias great sword I think, which i'll never have enough int to use anyway :(

Ps love the username haha, Dank souls is the shit
 




 "Neither campus authorities nor police believed her. Combined with the fact that she is broadcasting her rape to the media, granting interviews to anyone who will ask (heres a video interview with Time), and using it to get an easy A grade on her thesis, its safe to conclude that we are looking at a false rape accusation by a mentally unstable woman. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this girl was not truly raped, and instead was sour about being pumped and dumped after giving up her anus to a guy she had the tingles for." 




 LPT: If you're going to comment on a story at least read it first.
 




 I hope that mattress causes her to lose her balance on a very tall staircase...
 




 lol yeah I killed them in my first play through but now I always just nope past em to the shortcut
 




 hell even the regular hollows are dangerous with their berserk move. And don't get me started on the skeleton hounds in NG++... fucking 1 shots even with tank build and fully upgraded giant armour  




 lol 




  I agree he's probably one of the easiest high level boss fights, next to pinwheel..

 Gameplay wise, Four Kings because you just have to go all in and it's a rush falling into the abyss for the first time not knowing wtf is going on. But Nito is definitely my fave. So badass plus finally getting to warp out of the Tomb of the Giants after finishing him is a great feeling.  




 media =/= real life
 




 TIL there are elitist South Park fans. Insecure people can be pretentious about anything I guess..
 




 I think you take yourself a bit too seriously m8
 




 Half the episodes are based on current events and pop culture. The quality is and forever has been hit or miss. Some episodes are brilliant others are just filler. I'm just saying as long as they keep poking fun at current events the show can never become irrelevant. 
 




 I feel pretty much the opposite way.. like it can never really get stale unless society stops doing dumb shit that can be made fun of. Which will be never.
 




 What if I told you it doesn't matter in the slightest. Like literally not at all.  




 nice, for a second I thought I was in /r/synthesizers
 




 I totally needed this at 4 am....not. haha

but seriously that's some fucked up food for thought. 
 




 As far as I could tell the robot was actually designed to intentionally purchase illicit items from the deep web as part of an art project/experiment. All the items, including ecstasy, a fake passport and a ballcap with a hidden pov camera were confiscated at the end of the project, in accordance with the plan.
 




 Check out some fashion designs by companies like Aitor Throup, Musee Noir, Rick Owens. They're expensive as fuck but should serve as good inspiration.

 I am the Dank Lord, Lord of Dank, and I sit at the top of the throne with my gold and silver laurel of hempen leaves and a regal emerald cloak with brilliant ermine trim and silver lining.

At the foot of my throne are my two most loyal protectors, the great and formidable knights Sir Maxime Le Bouclier, Royal Aegis to the Hempen King, and Sir Eric Faucille, The Righteous Eradicator. Both are inhumanly large and wear highly ornate steel armour in the style of late 15th century German Gothic plate. 

As you may have guessed, they fight along side one another as a defender and aggressor, respectively. Sir Maxime bears a great bell mace and gigantic greatshield carved with all of the dope conquests of the Dank Lord, while Sir Eric wields a huge (15') halberd with a intricately carved axe blade on the top bearing the shape of a great hemp leaf. Both bear the kingdoms crest, a golden hemp leaf created using only the most sacred of geometry, upon their jet black tunics.

Beneath them is the Divine Cleric Aitor Laux, the greatest magic healer and sacred summoner in the kingdom. Very little possess magic, and he has been trained from a young age by members of the royal court to only use his magic for the good of the kingdom and his fellow subjects. He does not wear robes because even magic users find plate armour too dank to resist in my kingdom. 

Finally, we get to the main army. At the top is General Staffan Auriculaire, who is at the forefront of leading the Royal Aurian Knights into battle. His right hand man is known only as Sigha, and is one of the most deadly assassins in the realm. He is not known to make appearances on the battleground, but will oft be found alone and outnumbered deep within enemy territory, only to return intact and with his mission carried out. He is one of very few in the Royal Order exempt from wearing the standard royal plate armour, opting instead for tight fitting and dark armour of fine shadowmail, doing little to impede body movement while still offering great protection and camouflage. 

The Royal Aurian Knights are an order of dank knights recruited from every corner of the kingdom. In addition to the standard plate armour and kite shield, the lower ranking knights wear a great helm and carry maces, pikes, axes, and bows. The higher ranking knights wear an ornate bassinet helmet and generally are armed with greatswords and lances or rapiers and bucklers. In addition to the combat gear, each knight also carries a simple wooden gandalf pipe and a fat bag of loud.

 Ok.
 




 Seriously. Fuck this place. This is just a rage/rant post so if you're looking for introspective discussion look elsewhere but damn. I'm a high str melee build and this place has made me rage quit like twice tonight. I haven't really had any real problems with DS2 yet but the bleeding from the aberrations + homing magic missiles combo in the obstacle ridden water proves too much for this heavy armour knight. If only I had the rusted iron ring...

 Strava bike app. I used to have such a hard time getting motivated on my days off to just go outside and exercise. Now with weekly goals and daily tracking it's like ongoing videogame stats and I'm hooked on exercise, even if it's only so there's no blank entries on the app.

 Pretty sure it's a WoW reference
 




 For me it was "A Dark Tower" 




 Lol I feel like thats why Dark Souls is so well received. It's a game about western fantasy tropes made by Japanese people, so they kinda fucked it all up in the best way possible. It has a certain degree of familiarity but the formula has also been shook up enough that you have no idea what to expect. 




 ugh she is the worst type of parent. Demonstrates she's a bad parent by leaving her kids unattended in public, then demonizes anyone who talks to them without knowing what it was about. Maybe that's the reason WHY good parents don't leave their children unattended.  




 I work at a game store and I have to be careful around the demo systems for this reason. Yes lady, the reason why i'm over here is clearly because I have the irresistible urge to molest your ugly little kid and not because he's fucking ruining our controllers and getting popcorn all over the store.


 




 Love her and the movie. Only thing that irked me was the macbook. 




 Thank you! Looking at the structure I thought it was waaay too large and advanced for WWI era construction.  




 Word
 




 I've always been enamoured with the nightlife of the future. I like techno a lot, and I imagine in the future techno clubs (not EDM, there's a difference) will be vastly more popular, especially in North America. 

So while high tech automation deals with lots of the monotonous aspects of daily life, this frees up a lot of time for artists/musicians and party goers, leading to a more developed and sophisticated nightlife culture.
 




 Looks alright but to be honest I can't stand that style of character design. Makes me feel like i'm playing a little girls fashion accessorizing game or something, just doesn't fit the genre.  




 JPs real life inspiration
 




 You seem to like the hypnotic stuff just like me
 




 great taste!
 




 If you're into the Berlin scene definitely definitely check out Reclaim Your City podcast, some top notch mixes from the depths of the underground.
 




 yeah the first gate they'd have to cross is already like 3 stories high and the glowing door is another good ways from that..
 
























 buy them on iTunes like I had to :P
 




 So glad i'm not the only one who thought this! As soon as I saw the two initial combatants I was like ofuck two-handed greatsword vs broadsword and buckler... obviously the guy with the buckler is just gonna parry riposte that big dudes ass. Forgot how real life plays out..
 




 I don't mind the ones who do it for fun but I work at a gamestore and some people definitely take their opinions on gaming too seriously haha. Like they're BFFs with Miyazaki or something.

 Dank Souls is my favourite video ever
 




 Where'd all the footage of the guy wearing the Faraam set come from? Was that included in the original version of the game or just promo material?
I'm late to the party and only have SotFS
 




 I was thinking the Loyce Knights
 




 I solo'd Sinh fairly easily and I was stuck on Fume knight forever until I got help so i'm fairly confident you got this
 




 Shitty nightmare man. I once had one too where I was in a catacomb-esque closed off arena fighting a giant version of my own character. I was unarmed and he had full havel and a great sword, swung it down on me and that's when I woke up.
 




 Different strokes :) That sounds pleasant too. And don't worry haha we have a special, lower table for drinks. 
 




 idk, my mates and I make a time of it. Takeout, drinks, loud music, tons of weed.. Basically a party with computers and gaming. Playing from the comfort and solitude of home is nice too though. 
 




 Is a tv a monitor? Not even trolling just curious if any display = a monitor to some people 




 people with friends 




 WOAh ACTING
 




 Lol when Jared's like "I love The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo." Not going to lie I thought she gave off that vibe too. It's great.
 




 Pretty hard choice... character game is strong with this one. I love Gilfoyle, Dinesh and Jared all for different reasons though. Gilfoyle is the relatable one, Dinesh is just pure comedic gold and as a huge Office fan I can't get enough of OJ either.
 




 Na, i'm gonna keep watching. It was a meh episode except for a few laugh out loud parts but i'd be lying if I said I didn't still want to see where it's going. 

As for reality.. I mean I know some of the hardcore nerds out there would love to see a tech show 100% based in reality but come on guys. It's not like only programmers and hackers watch this shit. That would be fucking boring to like 95% of the audience.  




 Same. The whole invisible man treatment with Erlich always cracks me up
 




 Every time.  




 I laughed during the show and then came on to this sub and decided I needed to be angry about it because it broke consistency haha
 




 lol yea I hear Ivory Crown is an even bigger pain in the ass. Not looking forward to the lightning unicorns.
 




 "Just bring me some cool ranch doritos and chicken nuggets" NO DON'T OPEN THE DOOR MAM JUST LEAVE THEM OUTSIDE
 




 Thank you to NonYaBeznez on 360! I was stuck on the Fume Knight for nearly a week. I literally bought gold just to get help with the fight. Yesterday I managed to summon someone but we both kept dying to him anyway. Today this dude pops up and absolutely carries me away to victory. I maybe took out a third of the health myself. Thank you again friend! Now on to the frozen wastelands...
 




 It took me way too long to remember where the titanite demon is in Anor Londo. Blocked memory I guess. Those 1 hit downward jump stabs...:(

 




 Second one is true Solaire.. the other was casul
 




 Oh yeah I think you're right... Oh well that's her problem, I never had beef. I usually save ladyboy for the end of the playthrough anyway.
 




 Yeah for DaS1 at least in the earlier playthroughs, you could get a LOT accomplished via suicide runs. Like killing pinwheel before gargoyles kind of shortcuts. DaS2 suicide runs to flip a switch or grab an item are still viable but the whole health loss thing is a bit more of a deterrent.  




 First 6~ playthroughs I almost exclusively used two handed greatswords. Last playthrough I went through with a baller side sword... like a totally different game.
 




 I never ever kill any of the Firekeepers anymore and I always use the Dark Seance ring to get to Gwyndolin instead of killing Gwynevere. Only people I kill are Vamos for the helmet and of course that fuck Lautrec where he sits in his cell.
 




 Same. And the spooky skellies definitely reminded me of the catacombs!
 




 FUCK ZE FUME KNIGHT
 




 I thought resins were the only way to buff melee
 




 Aitor. edit: And always a knight.

 




 I've been through Dark Souls about 7 times now on the same character, love the world and the PvE experience to death but now i'm starting to get bored and want to try my hand at PvP. Only problem is i'm on an outdated system and it's also a bit of a financial commitment since this is the only game I play on console these days. 

So my question to those with 360's is: Is there still an active PvP community for Dark Souls?

Also, i'm neearly done DaS2, just stuck on the Fume Knight. I assume since this game is newer there's still a fair amount of people playing it, is this a fair assumption? I'll try out pvp on both of them if I get live, but from what I've heard from friends the original Dark Souls pvp experience is the way to go.

Any input would be appreciated! 




 Man I've played though like 7 times on a pure melee character because ranged spell casting has never been my thing...only recently realized after seeing a youtube video that some spells actually just buff your melee weapon.. now I kind of want to start a new character just to experience sunlight blade haha
 




 Don't get too cocky around Pinwheel. I once lost like ~500k souls because I forgot to retrieve them in the bonewheel area and died to a surprisingly nimble pinwheel one playthrough.
 




 My first playthough I thought they were an item you had to pick up more of as you went along (no idea they refilled at bonfires), so I managed to keep my original 5 until like the Taurus Demon, wondered why it was so fucking hard..
 




 Only point I ever use a shield in DaS1 is for the fight with Sif. Otherwise two-hand for dayz
 




 I've never pvp'd but i've gone through to NG+7 with full giant armour, waay too much strength and two-handed GLS/BKS/Zwei. Pure melee, All about dem tanks and swings. Just don't forget to equip the mega weed ring!
  




 Solid advice, just one of those boss fights that takes patience I guess!
 




 I do roll a lot and two hand my weapon though! I just always fuck up once he's got his flame sword buff and usually die to him around 1/4-1/5th hp haha :(. I just need to git gud.
 




 Absolutely :)
It's like the bass massaging every part of you at once!
 




 Thanks man i'll definitely look into those books, the "flow" effect is something that very much intrigues me.
 




 Agreed!
 




 said the same thing yesterday when I got out haha
 




 But I don't mind.
 




 I agree.
 




 You are right.
 




 Wow I never knew this was a thing, thanks for the heads up I hated getting through this place enough as it was! Love Veldstadt though. Fave boss! 




 That's crazy! On a side note I hate this boss so very much. So many tries and still I can't beat the fucker :(
 




 I tried explaining this to some of my mates who aren't into techno and they just sort of stared and laughed. It doesn't really happen with groovier and more percussion based tech housey stuff (which I still love), but a lot of the time when I'm listening to deep, textured rolling techno like Abdulla Rashim, Deepbass, Ness, Polar Inertia, etc I literally just kind of drift off into this weird meditation-like limbo where my mind is completely void of thoughts and the only signals i'm receiving are the shifts in the music and the physical sensations of the bass hitting me. During this time I can usually drift off to sleep in an instant regardless of the volume of the music, and basically everything else melts away until the mix ends or the vibe is somehow broken.

Do you know what I mean?
 




 First off just let me say that I love Adam Beyer as a DJ and I listen to his radio show every week. He throws a great party and his mixes are legendary. However, as a label, he and his fellow artists' releases are just very predictable and similar. Sure I love the Drumcode sound, but it's definitely a formula they rarely deviate from whereas other labels are constantly trying to evolve their sound. Plus like someone else said, time and a place. People on this sub want the gems and rare tracks, not something they can easily find on a top 100 list on Beatport.
 




 New macbook background! :) Love how you managed to combine futuristic and traditional architectural elements instead of just giving everything the Starwars treatment! Comes across as more organic.
 




 Damn son nice one!
 




 Eccentric setup in a good way! Love the triple vertical setup and the variety of boards. Do you watch anything with those monitors configured that way or do you have a tv for that? 




 Alright never caught the bit about the ocean being dried up, makes a lot of sense then!
 




 First off let me say that I absolutely loved the movie! I got dragged along to see it not expecting much but I was quite pleasantly surprised both by the quality of the actual action/stunts as well as the intriguing setting and lore. Also loved that we had no lame romantic subplot shoved down our throats. It certainly turned me onto the franchise in general, I'm definitely going to have to go back and watch the others now.

However, I do have one question that's been gnawing at me. At one point in the movie they reach the edge of the Citadel's wasteland and say something along the lines of "we have enough supplies for 160 days of riding" yet it's still implied that they wouldn't reach their destination if they attempted to go that way. If the events of Fury Road are set in Australia, then wouldn't it only take like ~30 days max to cross the entire country by vehicle? Or did they just say 16 days and I misheard them? 160 days does seem awful long...
 




 Haha wow that's a pretty lame reason to ban someone... probably some vegan, needs more chicken in their diet. GET HYPE!

 
























 I feel you. The scenery is cool, but WHY GOD WHY another poison level? Also I wish they had more engaging and interesting enemy placements early on like the Drakeblood knights instead of relying on mindless zombie foot-soldiers like so many other levels. I agree it's the weakest part of the DLC. 




 Shulva isn't too bad but I save the other two for end-game, they're pretty tough. Except frigid outskirts. Did it once, never again. Fuck that place.
 
 




 LOL
 




 Weird, I named my charizard Drogon last play through
 




 Dankwald sounds like a dank place to live
 




 Yeah my friends just saw her at Movement this year too, she still gets out haha 




 First time: 15 hrs
second time: 2 hrs (once you do a couple NG+ playthroughs you'll be reaching Anor Londo in your sleep)
 









 lmao
 




 Drain it and throw a warehouse party! 




 Yeah, seriously I love a good mech but it's like some of the posters on this sub base their entire identities around keyboards..I just feel bad. 




 Well said chap!
 




 Wow I believed this too until I got further down the thread...
Btw thanks for doing this AMA, love you and the show!
 




 Fumey is a more challenging fight but Sir Alonne has my favourite lore  besides Velstadt.
 




 Sir Alonne is the master!
respect!
 




 Same here on my most recent playthrough. Summons just kept messing up my dodge timings, found it easier solo.
 




 Pretty slick, like the design.
 




 I know i dropped that nug around here somewhere.... 




 lol that explains a lot. I was so confused after reading all this shit about enemy placements in SOTFS and then never actually coming across them in game. (e.g. Heide knights before the Cathedral of Blue)  




 lol that's actually what I use as my chime! I haven't actually tried fighting with it though, I just love the way it looks. I'll give it a shot in combat today! 
 




 Xbox 360
 




 Really? I have only ever played the SOTFS edition and mine is still found just after the Pursuer boss fight.

I wonder if the PC and the console versions of SOTFS are different, because i've also heard things like the repair cost for Ring of Life Protection going up to 14k but it's still only 3k for me on 360...
 




 Yeah at first I liked the red cape but now I can't stand it after going through my entire first playthrough with it. I love Llewelyn, reminds me a lot of the Nightwatcher cloaks from GoT
 




 Not wallpapers but if you're a big fan of Stroboscopic Artefacts art you might enjoy this blog. It's super active and I regularly go on it to find links to artwork or just for inspiration. http://otakugangsta.com 




 Yeah you're right, one thing i've come to notice about the Souls games is that the best strategies for killing them are usually the lamest. Dodge around, wait for combo to end, attack or heal, repeat...

Dodging and getting down tight timings is fun, but I'd love to have a system that encourages head on fighting and more viable options for those who prefer aggressive tank play styles, instead of always just kite or be killed.  




 Lol I just tried out the grand lance against Velstadt. I ended up ditching the shield early in and just two handing it but yeah I rekt him first try, definitely a good suggestion! And may I just say damn what a difference agility makes with dodging in that fight. My first playthrough I never put anything into ADP and fights like Velstadt and Fume were soo much harder!
 




 yeah sorry I thought it was redundant but they're definitely Heides, got them whilst farming for the set.
 




 Perfect, I actually have the grand lance and lance already just for fucking around with. I'll definitely have to give them a shot. I like that I can have my shield up too.
 




 Alright so i'm well into my third play-through on my original character, and i'm just wondering if I could be optimizing my damage/protection a little bit more. 

I'm a str build knight with 40 faith for sunlight blade. I have been using a Drakeblood Greatsword+5 paired with the lightening clutch because the DBGS also has lightning damage already. I know certain weapons definitely do more scaling str damage outright (great club, mastodon GS, Zwei) but I find the agile moveset and low stamina-per-swing cost of the lighter (6.0) Drakeblood sword much easier for boss fights. 

Soo I'm sorta just wondering if there's an even better dps weapon for this sort of play style that I might have overlooked.

Also, for armour generally I do my own fashion souls thing but sometimes I need extra protection if a boss is just kicking my ass for some reason. Is there any better set in terms of weight to defence ratio than fully upgraded Drangleic? I've tried the Heide set, Drakeblood set, Elite Knight set, Loyce set... nothing seems quite as good.
 




 techno as fuck
 




 Seriously this is all I ever see on that sub now.  There were like two today. Why are all these bitches knitting gaming shit now anyway? 




 Is this feature only for Japan? 




 Just enjoy it for what it is, it won't ruin Dark Souls trust me. Definitely not as memorable a method of story telling or general atmosphere, but the gameplay is still as addictive as any other Souls game and from a logistical standpoint many aspects have certainly been improved.  




 Man I always knew BKS was amazing against demons but damn I didn't think it could one shot bosses. This was just in NG right?
 




 I agree with the points you made on level design, but personally I appreciate the difficulty of the new bosses like the Fume Knight and the Kings Pets duo. They're completely optional end-game dlc bosses, why shouldn't they put up a good fight? Fume knight is my favourite fight by far because of the large and unpredictable move set.
  




 Awesome! :)
 




 Depends on who you are I guess haha.
I love parrying, even in pve. Feels badass parrying a pursuer or a alonne knight. 




 It's not that hard, just comes down to timing. No better place to learn than FoFG 




 Yeah str builds are my fave. Makes every boss fight more intimate, ya know?

Oh and one last tip- If you're playing online don't always trust the highest rated message haha 




 Like others here have said, you just need to adjust your strategy a bit if you're used to playing BB. Up your defence game, get your dodge timings down and if you're really stuck go back and farm a few levels.

I find for the Lost Sinner, like most fast, small and aggressive bosses, it's easiest to dodge consecutive hits to the right (their left) and hug them with lock on. (make sure you can at least medium roll with an equip load less than 70%) This way you can quickly dodge behind them to either get in a few hits or heal up before they start the new attack combo. If you like using shields to block consider finding a spear, as you can thrust attack while keeping your shield up with them. 




 What are the giant sentinel things guarding Anor Londo in the hall then? They have the same armour as the giant set. Are they the same species as Gwyn or are they related to the blacksmith/Sens giants? 




 Learn how to parry if you haven't already got it down. It will definitely help down the road in certain circumstances, especially early game. 

High dps ranged magic or hexes trivialize a lot of the boss fights, if you prefer a challenge/more of a sense of achievement go melee.

And don't fight near wooden chests, if you smash them you lose whatever was inside and just get rubbish..


  




 I donno man, that kinda looks like he's repping the house of pride. :P 
I can see why they went with the look they did in the show, the armour is just more consistent with the Kings Landing aesthetic they've created.   




 ..O S are only the hardest if you don't do the dlc.. trust. Also they're a lot harder if you solo them, definitely look for npcs to interact with along your journey :P


They'll definitely give you a run for your money your first play through though.  




 What is your guy's "boss music?" Or do you just listen to the games score every time? I appreciate a good soundtrack and I definitely always listen to it the first couple times around, but sometimes it just feels so great when you're kicking a bosses ass to your personal favourite battle jams. For me its Berghain techno or UK dubstep, depending on the pace and the setting. Sir Alonne? battlemarch drum techno. Iron Golem? ass numbing dub vibes. What about you guys? 




 This would explain why she went off course to kill Stannis... You might as well complete all the objectives in an area before heading back to town for the exp.
 




 We need hypeman Petyr Baelish announcing them UFC style as they jog out into the ring to a trap remix of Next Episode by Dre and Snoop 




 YES 




 Every campaign mission I ever played ended like that last panel..
 




 I know i've seen that pic, I was jk 




 I agree, it wasn't very well thought out. I felt like the bonfires had better placements in the DLCs (for the most part), like you actually had to work to find them and the places they were in made sense.  




 Smough before he let himself go 




 Seriously? I did the same thing but killed Siegmeyer and went on to the next game like nothing happened. Cold as fuck.
 




 lol you really don't like that Sinners Rise bonfire do you?
 




 damn.
k thanks.
 




 I have my 35 loyce souls in my inventory but I get no new dialogue from Alsanna and the ice on the stairs hasn't receded at all yet. Is there something else to it i'm not doing right or did they increase the number of souls required in SotFS?
 




 I think it's because this type of post has already been done before (pineapple drawing handed in as school project and posted to r/trees) so to some it just seems like a rip-off to reap some karma. 




 Kill me now 




 I think Rush definitely gets the attention they deserve by now, they're the plot device to a Hollywood comedy for fuck sakes. Pretty much everyone in Canada knows a few Rush songs, for better or for worse.

 




 One time I reflex attacked Onion bro in the cathedral in Anor Londo. Super sad :(

Glad in DaS2 they gave you a bit of leeway with accidentally hitting npcs.
 




 If you like fantasy stories about knights and lords with lots of weapons, armour, combat, power struggles and demons/monsters then you can't go wrong. Also it's Japanese so expect lots of fucked up sex scenes and gratuitous gore/disturbing imagery.

Story is on point though, it hits home for a lot of people. The characters aren't black and white, or pure good and pure evil, which makes things more interesting and less clichd.

 




 Right? I was picturing a robot ninja like the one from the movie Robot Ninja...
 




 Am I missing something? All this video did was demonstrate that we have the ability to use a robotic arm to precisely mimic human arm movements (which shouldn't come as a surprise to people given we already use them to laser cut complex designs to perfection). It's not like the machine bests him in a standoff. Barely even shows what the human was capable of, anybody can hack apart bamboo stalks or slice an orange in half for a camera...
 




 I just watched the Eclipse scene with 0 foresight into what was going to happen and damn... that escalated quickly.
