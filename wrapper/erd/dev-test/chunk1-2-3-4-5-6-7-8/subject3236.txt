   Its winter in Australia right now

hahaha sorry I didn't thought about it.. I recreated the logo from scratch. [here the psd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3jagjlacGj2MXQzUmdpeE41RGc/view?usp=sharing) 




 I run Win 7 x64 with 8 GB Ram and with Photoshop CC 2014 I didn't have any problem. Then I did a format and upgraded to CC 2015. Since then I can't render videos when I send and animation to render and photoshop crashes once in a while in various cases. Is anyone experiencing similar situations?

 I tried.. http://i.imgur.com/lJJZ0tK.jpg 




 Your welcome, and sorry for the mess.. 




 nope, I believe that we all have the right to love anyone we want and get married with anyone we want, I don't critisize people for who they love, I just don't like the idea. Freedom is for everyone and that's my opinion. Sorry but please don't continue the argument, we have opposite opinions and that's not a reason to ruin this gentlemans request. 




 I learned something from this picture, that's why I mentioned it. Please read carefully before commenting, people tend to get aggressive in these topics. 




 and that's exactly why I believe in freedom of speech! You did very good job there, looks great! 




 thanks 
























 [Here you go mate! UltraRealistic](http://i.imgur.com/4kMPBlI.jpg)

 A stable internet connection is also required. I'm basically paying anyone who can help me download a pdf collection. I'm from a third world country so I'm unable to download them due to service. I'm not paying much but it's quick money. Please send me PM if you are interested. 




 if someone could colorize it to it would be great http://i.imgur.com/6cofxZb.jpg 




 ok then 




 your welcome 




 what do you mean by saying 'interesting'? [Image](http://i.imgur.com/BHpsGbn.jpg) 




 patch tool http://i.imgur.com/VS2GCeP.png you can use it to remove pimples from faces. it actually does a smart copy and paste so the skin (example) will fit exactly were the pimple you selected was including most of times shadows and lighting thas why I used it there so I can actually create a smooth back ground like the first image 




 I don't have much time but check this one http://i.imgur.com/mzXD9FG.jpg otherwise I'm sure someone else will do it musch better for you
