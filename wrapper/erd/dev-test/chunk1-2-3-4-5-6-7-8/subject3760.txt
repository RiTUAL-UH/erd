Have tried an ASUS Strix with a 6 pin to 8 pin converter, and it works but the card doesn't run anywhere near full power.

 In an earlier post I mentioned that I'd been an F1 for the better part of four decades and that this period included Mansell vs Prost, Senna vs Prost, Hakkinen vs Schumacher, Villeneuve vs Pironi, Jones vs Reutemann, Hill vs. Schumacher and much more.

 Many people think that distribution of money is to blame for the troubles on the F1 grid. This is a brief explanation of how the money actually works (and why even distribution wouldn't make much difference to the mid-field teams).

The profit is split 60/40 in favor of the teams (63% of 1.18 billion in 2012 and around 60% of 1.4 billion in 2013). The remainder is then split again into two types of payment and distributed among the 11 teams after Ferrari receive an ex-gratia payment ( this was $17.5 million in 2013).

- Category 1 payments which are shared EQUALLY if you finish inside the top 10 for 3 years in a row.
- Category 2 payments which are based on racing performance but require being in the top 10 WCC at the end of the season.

**2013 Distribution**

- In 2013 10 teams received $34.12 million in Category 1 payments. 

- Marusia didn't get anything because it had not yet had three seasons in the top 10. 
- Caterham didn't get any Category 2 money because it was outside the top 10. 


- Of the teams allegedly in trouble now Sauber got $58 million, Williams $51.2 million, Force India $64.8 million, Lotus $71.62 million. 


- Of the bankrupt teams Marussia got $13.6 million, and Caterham $34.12 million.


**Equal shares**

If the fund had been shared equally each team would have received $62 million - which is not enough to make a serious difference to Sauber, Force India or Williams - in-fact Force India and Lotus would have received LESS.

This is a big difference for the bottom two teams, but not much difference for the mid-field ones. F1 teams don't go under for the lack of a few million, they go under for the lack of tens of millions.

**2013 Prize Money List** 

- Red Bull $98.97m 

- Mercedes $88.72 

- Ferrari $96m 

- Lotus $71.62m 

- McLaren $68.22m 

- Force India $64.8m 

- Sauber $58m 

- Toro Rosso $54.6m 

- Williams $51.2m 

- Marussia $13.6m 

- Caterham $34.12m


To provide some idea of costs, Caterham is spending $60 million a year, Mercedes is spending $300 million. HAAS is entering in 2016 with a planned first season budget of around $200 million.

The real problem is costs, and even then this only applies to teams that don't have any other underlying business backing the team. 




 I'm in the market for secondhand card. 

- It has to be NVidia (its destined for a Mac Pro and drivers are more widely available).
- It has to be one card, or so cheap I can afford 2 - no SLI with OSX
- It needs to support 3 monitor outputs.
- I have a budget of 200.  














 I've wanted a genuine Mac to replace my somewhat unreliable Triple Monitor Hackintosh for some time, and I've been looking at 2012 Mac Pro's for around 1300.

However I found a 2009 4,1 2.66 GHz Quad Core Xeon/8Mb/GT 120 512Mb at a second hand store for 249, knowing they sell for 4 - 600 on eBay I snapped it up. 

It benchmarks  around 8000, my existing system is around 12500. Because its the single core model the only economic upgrades right now are to the 4 core Westmere 3.33 W3580 and an NVIDIA GTX 780 6GB which come in at around 450 which means it will loosely match my Hackintosh minus USB3 and SATA 6Gb. 

An upgrade to the 12 core model comes in at 500 with the graphics card and processor that tops out at 1050, at which point I may as well have bought the 2012 model which is better in some respects.

Main pro is that it gives me a genuine Mac to fill in the gap while I save for a 2013 Mac Pro or better. Main con is the loss of SATA 6Gb and USB 3.0.

 A decade of attempts to prosecute Patrick Head and Adrian Newey failed to clear up the cause of the accident - IMO we would have been better off without a prosecution looking for fault. In the years that followed the conspiracy theories surrounding the crash muddied the waters enough that anyone with a genuine interest in what happened couldn't ask even the simplest question about it and get a sensible answer. 

The broad conclusion seems to be that the last minute modifications that Senna had requested to the steering column were badly executed, failed, and that caused the accident. Williams contend that the column failed on impact - but there was certainly some kind of cover up involved given what happened to the [black boxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Ayrton_Senna#Trial). That said there were certainly other factors both sporting and otherwise involved. At least three of the cars in that race, particularly the Benneton that Senna was racing, were running [illegal software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Formula_One_cheating_controversy), there are some questions over the tyres and the condition of the circuit - but accidents are never caused by just one factor. 

For me the worst part is that had the angle or speed of impact been fractionally different he probably would have survived, just as the 4 other drivers who had 180 mph crashes just there did. 

The files from [the trial](http://www.ayrton-senna.com/s-files/trialidx.html) are worth a read, particularly the testimony from the 4 other drivers that crashed at Tamburello in the years preceeding the 94' accident, and its also worth reading [Beatris Assumpcao's](http://betisesportsworld.net/2014/05/01/senna-what-bernie-really-said-to-leonardo-senna/) (Ayrton's PR) first hand account of the conversation between Bernie and Leonardo Senna after the accident (bear in mind only one person in that room was a native English speaker). 




 Well, its informative at least. The main point behind it was to highlight the cast of characters involved in the race - and it was a great race. 



















 Oh pretty much. This same fight has been going on since the sport began. Complaints are always the same - costs too high, too many rules, bad rules, dominant driver 'boring', dominant team 'boring', rules making body evil, people in charge demonic, money/tyres/engines ruining the sport etcetera, etcetera.

Its all happened before, and will happen again. 




 At the point both of those were written no one would have predicted HAAS becoming a Ferrari B team. Things change. 














 The wisdom in this sub seems to be that HAAS will be back of the grid, but looking a Sauber's performance this year I'd suspect mid-field, and aiming to challenge Lotus in a couple of seasons. Heck looking at Sauber this year, they could buy their 2014 chassis and still be mid-field with the Ferrari engine.

Equally interesting is the idea that they might partner with Dallara on a chassis - which could spell the beginning of a true customer car effort for F1.

I can't see why Raikkonen would go there unless he is very desperate for a seat, I also can't see why HAAS would need to pay that much for an experienced driver when there are many cheaper experienced driver options. Then again Hill went to Jordan - stranger things have happened in F1. 




 I agree, and I've advanced the same argument myself regarding family tickets because I'd love to take my kids to Silverstone. To do that I'm looking at 350 in tickets, 400 for accomodation, at least a 70 tank of fuel and spending money on top of that. All up it's around 1000 - 1200 for a race weekend. Average earnings are around 475 a week.

A 1991 general admission ticket for Silverstone cost me 35, plus 60 travel, 50 for accommodation, and then spending money. At the time I was earning about 250 a week. 

So the price has increased substantially, obviously, but it wasn't exactly cheap to begin with, and having worked at Silverstone for a decade marshalling stands I can't honestly say that motor racing fans in general are working class - we're not NASCAR.

TV is expensive - 700 per year for a sky package - or 139.80 a season for Now TV, and I do think it puts fans off, but it also pays for the show. Its easy to make the argument that anything is too expensive, because everything is, but we do have to face the financial reality of the sport. 




 He's a pretty good guy and loves the competition. He seems to be loving the competition with Alonso, even if the car sucks.

Fascinating insight from him about Hamilton considering how closely they raced at McLaren. 




 Theoretically, yes, but they still have to deal with this season's costs. They're not going to turn down sponsors and money. 




 They just announced a 40 million loss, any revenue is helpful.

I like Hulkenberg, but they have a tradition of pairing rookie's with more experienced drivers and, sad as I am to say it, I don't see what they would get from Hulkenberg that they couldn't get elsewhere for less money and the prospect of a longer career in the team. 




 Godaddy is leaving NASCAR, and they'll be sponsoring her personally rather than the team she drives for after leaving. They're focussing more on international markets - which makes some interesting possibilities!

I hope Speed stays where he is and I'd love to see JEV back in an F1 seat, but I suspect with the 600lb Gorilla that is Merc behind him that Wherlien will find a drive quickly. 




 Thats a truly absurd one. 

I'm quite interested in the idea of Danica Patrick to HAAS, would shake things up quite nicely. Certainly create some positive noise and controversy in the USA market, which will only help bring fans along.

Mercedes are very keen on Pascal Wherlien since they funded Force India's testing to get him some kilometers - he'd have to be in the running if Bottas left Willams, or for the other HAAS seat. 
























 "But you will see a more determined Lewis at the next race. I remember with Lewis that when we had a tussle in a race or there was an issue between us or with the team, he would have a really bad race and be quite outspoken and emotional. And at the next race he would destroy me. He would come back stronger than ever."

"Initially, he is an emotional character, and he will be quite hurt, but he comes back strong. After a bad race he would arrive at the next one very quiet, and then go out and blitz it. He will do the same in Canada - he will probably be untouchable in Canada. And he likes the circuit."

There are quite a few variations of partial quotes knocking around the media sphere but that's the most complete one I could find.

http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/formula-1-button-predicts-hamilton-will-destroy-rosberg-canada-after-monaco-rift-1450272

http://www1.skysports.com/f1/news/24181/9327816/jenson-button-feels-an-unhappy-lewis-hamilton-will-be-untouchable-in-canada 




 This is the peak of Rosberg's F1 career - he has the best car, the best engine, the best team, and enough money to buy the best trainers and sports psychologists. 

Every advantage you could want as a driver is his - his future is entirely in his own two hands. So, while I do feel some sympathy for his obvious difficulties, its not a huge amount. 














 True. But its also not an uncommon setup Renault are based at Viry-Chtillon for example. Mostly I suspect they would want specialised facilities and a place to house their backroom staff in Europe. 




 I suspect Lewis knows what's up already. As one commenter put it yesterday, he is in God Mode right now. 




 Jensen said that if he beat Lewis, Hamilton would be quite emotional after the race, then simply "destroy" him the next time out. 
























 Likely as not McLaren don't have the facilities they need - Mercedes did their engine development at a separate facility. 





























 Why do you post so consistently like a Rosbergette then? 




 I post positive and negative stuff about Rosberg, Hamilton and plenty of other drivers - there certainly is no 'campaign'! 

You're just sore because the driver you like isn't winning the war. 
 




 The team aren't allowed tell him where the button for that mode is anymore ;o) 




 We all have. Hamilton's anger in losing is directed at himself and he uses that on the track the next time out, although sometimes it gets hold of him for long periods - but its an outward reflection of an inner disappointment.

Rosberg gets pissed off at everyone else, does dumb stuff on track, plays tricks that backfire, and/or says something stupid, then lashes out looking for an external source to blame for his errors or lack of success. 

Rosberg is supposed to be the engineer and thinker - but I can't see any evidence that is the case. As /u/cock-a-doodle-doo says, Lewis is in God mode at the moment, nothing Rosberg has in his arsenal is making a dent and blaming Lewis appears to be his only refuge right now. 




 I'm beginning to think he has a preference for that type of car. 
























 Sad but true. Nico really needs figure out how to put up a proper fight or accept number two status - I don't think his head is anywhere near either of those things right now. 
























 See explanation here http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/33ozaa/are_you_enjoying_the_return_of_sparks_to_f1/cqn3cey 




 "The purpose of making them out of titanium is threefold: Firstly, it's safer, because if they do come off they are about a third of the weight of the existing ones. Secondly, the titanium wears some 2-2.5 times more quickly than the metal currently used. Thus cars will have to be run a little bit higher to manage wear and teams won't be able to drag them on the ground quite as much as they have in the past. The third effect is that you will see a lot more sparks, which some people think will look a little more spectacular." **- Charlie Whiting** 









 In the days without refuelling a car's weight would change drastically during the race. 

To avoid damage to the underside of the car when it was heavy with fuel at the start of the race the teams employed magnesium strips between the rear wheels. These would wear away during the race leaving the correct floor profile once the car was light enough to run in optimum trim.  




 Planks were introduced in 94' principally because of Senna's accident, the car's speed needed to be kept down for safety reasons. There are other factors too, no one really wants to fund the technology race stepped floors would bring with them.

If you [look at the plank](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Honda_RC-F1_2.0X_bottom_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg/1920px-Honda_RC-F1_2.0X_bottom_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg) you'll see there are [metal parts in it](http://f1.imgci.com/PICTURES/CMS/24100/24139.jpg) - there have always been metal parts in it - its just that they didn't spark. 




 We designed engines that output fantastic amounts of heat - the more powerful the engines became the more heat we had to deal with.

Then we designed aero that streamlines the cars movement, but throws off extremely turbulent air.

Then we discovered that a consequence of both was that you would destroy your tyres, and also your brakes, getting near the driver in front - you could barely establish tow anymore - so overtaking became impossible.

DRS and narrower cars and rear wings are a technical solution to a technically generated problem. Push-to-pass is just another solution to the same issue. 




 They simply changed the metal skid block in the planks to titanium rather than a heavier metal - it prevents the teams running the cars too low and it causes less punctures. 









 I suspect he's thinking of the 60s and 70s when people would buy and old chassis and jump in for a couple of races.

Would certainly enliven the driver market as it would open up a few more seats and allow some rookies to show their stuff. I don't think its a horrible idea.

Caterham, Marussia, and similar teams have basically been in a separate F1 class for a very long time, improved reliability has robbed us of the heroic back of the grid podium drives that you used to get when the front four blew up or crashed out, so why not. 




 According to [Charlie Whiting](http://en.espn.co.uk/fia/motorsport/story/167205.html) they're not just for show, the sparks are welcome side effect of a downforce reduction and safety measure.

That said according to Brundle Sainz and Ricciardo have said you need to keep your visor shut when following other cars now - the sparks do seem more extreme than they used to be (edit: I'm wrong on this last [point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmgMxqZd9jw) thank you /u/AutoEngineer22 for the reminder).

"To explain: the plank is the long bit of wood, the skids are bits of metal within the plank. The skids have formerly been made of a heavy metal, which has been very resistant to wear, and they put the skids around the points in the plank where thickness is measured. Planks have to start off at nominally 10mm thick and they can't be less than 9mm thick. However, we only measure them around certain holes in the plank. So they position the skids around those holes.

"This metal is extremely heavy and when pieces detach they can be extremely harmful. We saw two punctures in Spa previously because of bits of this metal that lay in a kerb and caused damage. In a worst case scenario they could fly off and hit someone.

"The purpose of making them out of titanium is threefold: Firstly, it's safer, because if they do come off they are about a third of the weight of the existing ones. Secondly, the titanium wears some 2-2.5 times more quickly than the metal currently used. Thus cars will have to be run a little bit higher to manage wear and teams won't be able to drag them on the ground quite as much as they have in the past. The third effect is that you will see a lot more sparks, which some people think will look a little more spectacular."

edit: here is what [the plank looks like](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Honda_RC-F1_2.0X_bottom_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg/1920px-Honda_RC-F1_2.0X_bottom_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg) on Honda's RC-F1 test car. Crashtor provides us with another example [here](http://f1.imgci.com/PICTURES/CMS/24100/24139.jpg). 




 Its a cost reduction effort. One engine per race would quadruple the engine costs. 
























 I realise that's the meme on costs but where is the evidence that this is a new problem?

Most say 'teams are going under' - since 1950 there have been 137 official F1 constructors, only 10 remain active and the median average constructor competes for 3 seasons, in 20 races, with 5 drivers wins nothing, and scores no points.

'Costs are increasing' - In 2003 Jordan Ford's annual budget was around [$79 million](http://www.economist.com/node/2785546), in 2015 dollars thats $101 million, which is about the annual budget estimation for the mid-pack teams today, some are as low as $80 million. 

Ferrari by comparison were spending $300 - $400 million in 2003, and they're spending around $250 million this year. 

Overall that suggests that costs have slowed or remained the same rather than climbed as steeply as everyone seems to imagine.

People also bang on about the race fee, but FOM has cut sweetheart deals for most of the old european circuits, and has covered Hockenheim's losses since 2009 to the tune of 27 million Euro. People act like the race fee is pure profit that is being drained out of the sport - again no evidence - F1's profits last year were $398 million on $1.6 billion revenue - most of the costs were money paid out to the teams. 
























 Classic Senna move from Massa 




 I honestly don't know how I missed it - first time I've ever been grateful for youtube follow up. 









 Massa had the racing line and was more than half way alongside, Coulthard should have pulled out and gone for him at the next corner - he was running out of road and assumed Massa didn't want to crash. 
























 "If he doesn't I'm going to kick three colours of shit out of the little bastard."

Nice considering Coulthard drove into Massa. 




 Everyone is a pay driver, its a distinction without meaning anymore, truth is it's been that way since the 70s. Getting sponsors, getting into a young driver programme, or both is now as much a part of the race as performing on the track. 

Young drivers are having to form investment companies which sell portions of their future earnings to raise the cash to compete.

Sponsors go to drivers and drivers bring them to teams for all but the top four. Alonso bought Santander to McLaren and Ferrari leaving them behind when he left. 




 Which I've pointed out elsewhere in the thread. 

But, the 5th engine was agreed in Malaysia according to Horner and is just a formal fax vote away. So in reality its going to be 3.8 (4) engines a race.  




  20 races / 4 engines = 5 races per engine.

German Grand Prix has been cancelled so its a 19 race season, not 20.

 




 I imagine they were anticipating that coming along, and losing the German Grand Prix means they have one less race to manage, but that still means each engine has to last 3.8 races rather than 4.75 (obviously 4 and 5 races in practice).

Its going to be very interesting to see how the end of the season plays out. 




 Of new engines, sure, they'll still have re-conditions. 

It also suggests that the might have some reliability concerns and some worries over Mercedes development rate. 












































 Its actually quite a big difference in cooling. The helmet winglet disrupts airflow into the vents on the side of the airbox and the airbox itself, area's which have become very important since 2014. 

RedBull actually tested wingless helmets this year to see if they could eliminate helmet lift some other way, but you could see the air displacement in flow-viz. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/33dqa5/hondas_radical_formula_1_engine/ 




 Yes, I missed the essential detail.

People could always read the article, oh wait, this is reddit. 




 Happy to see this story, many people tell me that drivers don't influence the design of F1 cars. Nothing could be further from the truth. 




 Because they knew Ferrari had little chance of getting to Hamilton if he built a lead, but a 100% shot getting by Rosberg. Look at [the race strategy](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2015/04/could-raikkonen-have-won-bahrain-and-did-mercedes-leave-rosberg-at-vettels-mercy/) report, if Kimi had got into P2 in quali then he had a very decent shot a the win. 

Nico wasn't racing Hamilton, or in with a shot at racing Hamilton.  














 And Stuttgart. Marketing is marketing. 




 It was McLaren's publicly stated intent to acquire another British driver, just as when Mercedes talked about buying a team they said they wanted an all German line up. 




 Teams make marketing decisions, and its important within Germany that they're seen to be supporting German drivers. Its really no different than McLaren choosing an all British line up. 




 They'll want at least one German driver, when they launched the team the thinking was an all German lineup, and Rosberg was the only available driver at the required level to partner Schumacher. If they replace Rosberg it'll be with Wehrlien assuming Vettel is unavailable. 




 Equal status is about opportunity, not on track realities, it means the driver in front gets preferential treatment - the drivers job is to make sure he's the one in front. 

Though, as we've seen in the last two races Rosberg has received pit priority when his strategy needed it, and so went ahead of Lewis. You don't hear Hamilton fans complaining about that... 




 If you read the Nico [can't hide my 'disappointment' article](http://www.grandprix247.com/2015/04/22/rosberg-i-cant-always-hide-my-disappointment/) you'll find he says it is in his contract. Judging by his results against Schumacher it always has been. 



















 He started from the pit lane and retired after thirteen laps. 



















 Parade laps don't count you have to cross the start line after lights out . 




 If you're bothered the information is on just about any F1 records site and on the wiki. Its hardly secret information. 




 They'd seen the brake temperate issue from the very first lap, I don't know if they'd been told to expect it, but as I said, it wasn't that the didn't have any brakes, its that the brakes they had changed all of a sudden. 




 Believe it or not he hasn't been in F1 long enough to break 150.

His run started at Monaco 2008 and he's done 126 consecutive starts to date. 




 Lewis, in his BBC interview, and Toto in his post-race on Sky, both said that the car does have brakes when the system is in failure mode, but that the pedal travel goes from short/hard to long/soft. 

This is fine if you're expecting it, as you can drive to it, but Rosberg's went in the middle of the braking zone so he had no chance to adjust. Lewis remembered some kind of switch combination which managed to bring his back. 




 Interestingly this is just about the only F1 top 10 that doesn't feature Schumacher, his runs at this record ended in:-

- Italy 94' excluded for two races for ignoring stop go penalty and a black flag. 
- France 96' with an engine failure on the formation lap.
- Austria 99' missed 6 races with a broken leg. 




 The mistake is at the website end - the quote in the title is from Max, I posted it earlier with the original title and got flak from the anti Jos circle jerk crowd, now I'm getting the opposite and downvoted to boot. Can't win! 




 - Riccardo Patrese - 187 (BEL 1982  AUS 1993)
- Jenson Button - 179 (FRA 2005  CHN 2015)
- Fernando Alonso - 176 (FRA 2005  ABD 2014)

 Yep:

For the otherwise highly-impressive 17-year-old Max, it has been a frustrating start to his career with three car failures in four races.

Maybe thats a record, the young Dutchman smiled wryly. Its a bit ridiculous. Of course Im worried about the future.

I try to stay positive, but now my fist is hitting the table. This cannot continue, but I know they understand that too, Verstappen added.
 




 I'm not disagreeing with your logic, but even the 'great' drivers have off years. There are a lot of reasons behind them, but I don't think you can genuinely separate driver from car from team.

For me at least, its *team* sport - part of the race is getting into the good teams with the great cars and learning enough along the way to deliver on track. I've never bought the argument that you could stick any driver in a great car and they'd win - maybe because I've seen too many pairings that prove otherwise. 




 Clark had his off year in 1966 coming 6th in the WDC with Team Lotus - he wasn't beaten by his teammate because he had 8 other drivers and three different engine manufacturers during the season. 

Senna's worst year was 84', his first year, where he came 9th in the WDC. Just like Clark he had multiple teammates that year (3) so wasn't beaten by his teammate. 

Teammate comparisons don't really hold, because its only recently teams have equivalence - most of Senna's teammate's were not anywhere near his class - just reliable number twos. 




 I wish more people understood this point. 




 James Allen produces a race report every tuesday after the race that contains this kind of information. Weirdly few people seem to be interested in it. 




 Consequence of a powerful engine and fast car IMO some of the reasoning behind the new wing is keeping turbulent hot air away from the tyres. 




 Toto also pointed out that they saw the brake temperature issue right from the start of the race, so keeping the pace down would likely help keep the brake temperature under control. 





























 I'm beginning to think its part of their fairness strategy. 




 Its going to make Canada very interesting. 



















 Strongly suspect a commentary career beckons for Mr Button when he's done racing! 







































 He said they were dangerous himself yesterday evening. When Williams started to best him in Q2 I thought he had some kind of problem - it's his favorite circuit so I was expecting him to beat Lewis this time around. 




 I'd argue that when they have a WDC winner in the number one spot they look for a reliable second tier driver to back them up in the WCC stakes. 

But as I've said elsewhere Ferrari seem to have realised that their own orthodoxy is getting in their way. All I'm really saying is that a younger generation's input into their engineering team would not be out of place - many other teams seem to benefit greatly from it. 




 Actually a season long qualifying competition isn't a bad idea. There is a pole position trophy already so it might be fun to spice it up. 




 So Hamilton took his 4th pole of the season and Rosberg got beaten by Hamilton, Vettel, Bottas and Raikkonen at various points in todays sessions. Ouch. 

This happened at his favorite circuit and one he's been on pole at two years in a row. Double ouch. 




 'Shut up and drive' never had more meaning for an F1 driver. 




 "I want the Ferrari's to be closer" - famous last words. 









 I think, since its Williams Martini, rather than Martini Williams, that they're making a smaller contribution than one might expect. I'm certain they don't have an ownership interest in the company, as Williams is publicly listed. 




 Ordinarily I'd agree, but I think Ferrari may have realised that 'their style' is actually a problem for them and so they need to question their own orthodoxy.

Its been pointed out by a number of pundits and commentators that the new drivers have a somewhat different style, 'feel', and approach to racing lines than most of the senior field. I think some of that is down to their having grown up lionising the attacking styles of Hamilton and Vettel rather than the more fluid (in the corners) Schumacher. 

Equally Red Bull and McLaren have done very well out of fast promotions, Ferrari not so much, so I suspect they'll be having a conversation about getting the next generation in the door early on. 









 I've always thought that it wasn't bad luck that Alonso has ended up with the cars that he did but poor feedback from him, and a preference for difficult suspension geometry. 




 I'm so disappointed that JEV didn't get an F1 drive!

So yeah, I'd see him in a Ferrari seat alongside Vettel. It's going to be interesting to see who HAAS take and I can see Lotus abandoning Maldonado which would create some more seats.  




 I'm sure he's also in the frame! It's not an exhaustive list. 




 I didn't see any sector times in China that couldn't be explained by tyre deg or strategy. F1 isn't, and never has been, about pure speed, it's really about carrying speed through the corners better than the opposition. That's what Red Bull were very good at. 




 Drivers have a lot more input into car development than most people on here seem to appreciate - drivers move car development as much, if not more so, than car development moves driving style. 

It's also a challenge to build a team around you, as a driver, that can deliver reliability and win.

 




 I don't think that's fair looking at 2008, and the number one driver situation at Ferrari has been true for decades. Any driver going in there knows where he stands.

Kimi's 35, even he wasn't sure he wanted to race longer than 2015, and he's been happier at Ferrari than any other team. 




 I'd like to see him outrace Massa consistently but he and Ricciardo  would definitely be in the frame. 




 Too much is made of the Hamilton/Ferrari possibility. 

There are plenty of other young drivers worthy of Ferrari's consideration, that Vettel would be compatible with, that would save money in the short term and deliver in the long term. Organisationally they are focussed on the next 5 years, not the next two. 

Verstappen springs to mind, as do several GP2 drivers like Stevens and Wherlien. The younger generation of drivers are really quite different in style than the current senior generation and Ferrari need that input. 




 I do. 

Aside from the fact that Red Bull are *notorious* for making late decisions about driver line ups, there is a straight commercial advantage in ensuring drivers don't take their secrets to other F1 teams. Looking at the way they've played the Renault situation it also fits with the way they think about going racing.

Leaks were a big concern of RBR's when Vettel left and Prodromou departed for McLaren - an entirely justified one as this season has demonstrated so far looking at McLaren's front wing and chassis - but its now obvious that Red Bull have problems deeper than the PU.

It's also worth pointing out that the brain drain from Ferrari over the 2010 WDC benefited Mercedes enormously, and it's a straight line from there to Mercedes 2013 success - Mercedes real innovation was getting the chassis right. They already had the most powerful engine in the two years before 2013. 

In essence Ferrari fired the wrong people in their rush to find someone to carry the can for their 2010 failure, and avoid blaming senior management or the drivers, as was finally noticed at the end of last year. Equally Red Bull appear to have a blame culture problem that extends from the very top of the organisation down. 




 I can imagine Webber is - he never struggled for an opinion! 




 Its a pity that you don't. Although I really enjoy Brundle's commentary I'm beginning to find Crofty at little irritating.

Part of me hopes that Button will take up commentary when he retires - he always has sensible, well informed, things to say. 



















 He did, and as I say, I don't want to take away from Ricciardo's achievements, which are many and impressive. There is an unfortunate tendency these days to view saying that, for example, Hamilton is a 'historic' driver as implied criticism of Rosberg - when it isn't. A fast glance at the F1 driver record books is enough to settle that debate.

I haven't lived in Aussie since 2005, but I do remember Murray Walker doing a Channel 10 special with Alan Jones on one of that era's races - perhaps it was just a special. Since I was travelling at the time I wasn't really in touch with TV. 




  It's not just the recession, it's the fact that the budgets have climbed so high that nobody wants to pay for the majority of the budget through sponsorship.

Nonsense. In 2003 Jordan Ford's annual budget was around [$79 million](http://www.economist.com/node/2785546), in 2015 dollars thats $101 million, which is about the annual budget estimation for the mid-pack teams, some are as low as $80 million. 

Ferrari by comparison were spending $200 - $400 million in 2003, and they're spending around $250 million this year. 

Which, overall, suggests that costs have slowed or remained the same rather than climbed as steeply as everyone seems to imagine. 




 Yep, on a circuit with two long straights Merc were always going to win if they made the right strategy calls. I was hoping Rosberg would do a better job at the start though and get closer to Hamilton in the opening laps.

Interesting reaction from Rosberg to the Ferrari threat though.
 




























































































































 His manager walked into the F1 paddock in Spain, was asked a respectful question, and answered it. 

How is that hassling the family on any level? 




 Pretty damning indictment of old Ferrari isn't it? I thought he had been kicked out, but I guess this changes my opinion. 




 That's usually how it works, they don't give it away for free, there is a payment of some kind involved but its often a promotional trade off.  









 The last tyre war wasn't very good for the drivers or the sport, so I'm not convinced thats a solution to a problem the sport has. 

Pirelli were asked to get us to three stop races, and they've done a pretty good job of meeting that target. Speeds always increase through time as the teams find engineering solutions to the constraints of the rules. 









 Higher than you'd think, its actually a relatively common occurrence - Brundle said something along the lines of 'we've all experienced that and learned the hard way to throw them clear of the car' toward the end of the Sky coverage.  




 Pretty amazing work from Merc save for Hamilton's balance issues.

Ferrari seem to have completely fluffed the upgrade cycle, left themselves with no idea what works and what doesn't, and not made the expected gains as result. 




 They were the first to press, its a direct quote from the manager rather than the paper, and you can find the same story with the same quote in dozens of other publications right now. 




 Read about any of the top driver deals over the last couple of decades, those are the common terms. Price range will be with the confines of the Vettel and Alonso deals, give or take performance bonuses etc.

Jenson was able to keep the BGP car because it was in his contract for example. 




 Increased wear = heat = expansion. They're bound to be using a material that keeps any expansion to a minimum but even a small amount could affect the seating of the gun on the wheel fastening. 




 Somewhere in the 120 - 140 million over three years range including performance bonuses, keep the trophies, keep any WDC winning car, media and sponsor work to a minimum - typical stuff for top drivers. 




 Looking at the media speculation Hamilton's team are seeking a deal similar to Alonso and Vettel, the Mercedes board seems to be choking on it a little bit. 




 And you won't, because both of those things are extremely unlikely given the type and severity of the injury.

Looking at the media stories there haven't been any similar quotes from her since December.  














 She said

"There are small improvements, but the road is still very long."

This a woman who is extremely close to the family and who has spent each day since the accident fending off almost any media speculation or stories about Schumacher. So for her to actually comment and say something positive (however small) is really good news.

With the type of injuries suffered by both Schumacher and Bianchi all you can really expect are (very) small improvements. A member of my family, sadly a child, suffered serious brain trauma and it took four years for any real progress to manifest itself. 



















 Try deleting the app downloading it again and restoring the subscription. This worked for me. 




 What kind of device do you have it on - are you relying on wifi or cellular data? 




 You have a source for that? I thought I'd seen his post drive chat with Button - was there an interview I've missed? 














 Ted K mentioned this in his [notebook](https://youtu.be/yufbj7NWojA?t=13m35s).  




 Since the potential field only includes people with 6 - 10 billion to spend I'm not confident there is a good solution. 




 IMO testing liveries don't count! 



















 They were all pretty huge, although the angle of the photo accentuates the size. I believe that at the time you had more choice of [rim size](http://www.smcars.net/attachments/formulas-png.81696/) because there does appear to be a wide vairiation amongst the cars of that era.

The innovation was the mounting of the engine at 3.5 degrees to assist ground effect - something [copied more sucessfully by the Ferrari F10](http://www.auto123.com/en/racing-news/f1-the-striking-1979-arrows-a2-that-inspired-the-2010-ferrari-f10?artid=115830). 




 He does, and he's had career long bad luck! 

But he's amazingly quick - the other guys at the front of the grid hadn't even hit puberty when Kimi got his first F1 drive. 







































 6th 




 You've missed the point of the entire discussion that was taking place. 




 True, but more recently the wind-tunnel issues demonstrated where their real problems lay. 

The engineers said we need a new 60% scale wind tunnel, management said make do with what you have. Basically the next four years were a write off! Management simply didn't understand the needs of the team - using alternative facilities whilst fixing their own basically cost five times as much.

It's one example, but it highlights the problem. The decision makers just didn't get it. 




 The whole reason that Schui was trying to bully his way past Wurz was that he wanted to chase Mika, he certainly thought he was in with a shot! Hakkinen made mistakes and had brake problems, if Schui could have put him under pressure then he might have forced an error.

Schui had start problems for years - it was one of the biggest problems in his early career and something he worked very hard on, especially after 1995.  




 Absolutely! For the first time in 30 odd years of watching I actually like the team. 

They seem to have finally addressed the internal power structure problems that have dogged them since the 90s - all it took was the racing team sinking the flotation. I guess these issues were easy to ignore when they were winning with Schumacher. 




 Well, it's killed a few engine components and had a credible attempt at munching on Maldonado. 




 6 points is almost half the deficit! That Ferrari also wasn't as good as the McLaren in fast corners and was hard on its tyres. He could have won Monaco had he shown more patience.

You also forget Schumacher stalled it on the grid in Japan before the puncture. As I said, if he and the Ferrari had performed better he would have sealed it, but the car let him down and he made too many unforced errors. The DC crash hurt, but he had plenty of chances. 




 You are correct on the points. But reliability really cost him, he had the championship in his own hands that year. 




 He finished the season ~~24~~ 14 points down. Arguably his over aggressive attempts to get past Wurtz at Monaco, two mechanical retirements, three thirds and a fifth cost him the WDC rather than anything DC did.

He and Ferrari had the championship in their own hands. 
























 I think the feeling was mutual, much like the antipathy between [Schumacher and Alonso](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2010/03/alonso-and-schumacher-renew-hostilities/). But taking Damon Hill out etc - he had an angry streak for a very long time. 

Even as late in his carrer in 2010 he almost put [Barrichello](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8875352.stm) into the wall. 




 He was far from cool as ice in his younger days. Quite the hothead for a few years. 


































 Considering Ferrari fired Aldo Costa because Alonso lost the 2010 championship, and he went on to be the Engineering Director responsible for the W05 and W06, Mercedes might discover a sudden need for catering staff! 














 It is, but choosing a new engine, and having one blow up are quite different. 









 Fascinating read, thanks for that link!

 




 Several reasons:-

- Voting for this may allow them to make a deal on something they want now, or in the future.

- The extra engine might be helpful to Mercedes.

- Sporting considerations - everyone wants a competitive series.

- Having several teams able to test new engines (which may have upgraded components compared to race engines) allows Mercedes plenty of room for development and curing reliability issues.
 




 I doubt Ferrari are a serious factor in Mercedes decisions on this one because they seem to have good reliability, and Merc want/need the competition for the sake of the show. 

Its more likely that Mercedes would be influenced by their customer teams needs. Down grid, RBR and McLaren are a potential threat to Lotus and Williams - both teams where money plays a more significant role and data gathering is helpful (though not dramatically so). 



















 Thanks. I was beginning to wonder about him! 




 That's wide of the mark. His results look more like Alonso's than anyone else's - 2nd in the WDC four times, 3rd three times.

He was a *brilliant* driver just without that tiny little extra margin, and he hit his peak at the same time as Fangio which didn't help.  




  James Allison tried his damndest to keep Alonso

He and Alonso have a relationship going back to Renault, but [I always thought that](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula-one/22470411) it was Alonso that wanted Allison rather than the other way around.

James Allison starting at Ferrari on Sept 1 as chassis tech direc will likely help pacify a certain Spaniard today, bet the phone's been hot - Martin Brundle

Of course Vettel had a stated preference for Kimi.

Id prefer Kimi. I need to be careful now. Nothing against Fernando, I respect him a lot as a driver but I think I respect Kimi on track and off track because hes always been very straight with me and from that point of view it might be a bit easier. 




 Seb's always talked of being a Ferrari driver, even when he was in the German BMW formula, there is an interview somewhere but I can't lay my hands on the link.

Interesting though, I'd long suspected that Ferrari had an informal deal with Vettel [because of his relationship with Schumacher, and Schumacher's dislike for Alonso] that when he was ready to move they would open the door. This also confirms that Ferrari left Alonso rather than the other way around.  




 Ah, no worries! 




 Rabid?! I'm very fair and balanced when it comes to Rosberg ;o)

Although if you severed me in two I'm pretty sure that underneath Formula 1 it would read Senna - Mansell - Hill - Hamilton - Button, then England Rugby. 




 Stevenage is mostly a *very* middle class post war new-town (concrete and unpleasant). Its actually about an hour and a half away from London by road or rail. 




 Jeez what a mess! 














 That BMW's next test driver would be a 4 time WDC, and Alonso wouldn't win the championship in the next 8 years. 




 Haven't NASCAR implemented a similarly weird system now - only x number of races count towards the championship? 









 I only bothered to downvote because you were being an ass. 

GM School Bus Yellow is a shade of orange, not yellow, so you were wrong about that too. 




 Ferrari just seem to have pursued a completely different car concept. 

If I understand RBR correctly they relied on the short nose solution to deal with the turbulent air over the front wheels, couldn't get it through the crash tests, and the car is a dog without it. Hence their thinking that they will see major gains now they have it working. 

Ferrari appear to have focussed on unleashing last years aero-compromised engine, improving the suspension geometry, and getting the cooling right, rather than expending staff time and money on the nose. 



















 Nice work editing the original comment and then deleting and reposting your reply. As is obvious to you now the context wasn't clear, hence my response.

In actual fact one owner was told by a former McLaren mechanic to use ['GM School Bus Yellow'](http://paintref.com/cgi-bin/colorcodedisplay.cgi?style=print type=paint paint=79904 ditzler=2785 syear=1975 smanuf=GM smodel= sname=School%20Bus%20Yellow cols=simple rows=150) on his M6A - as you can see from the link it is the correct colour. 









 To Torro Rosso - CASIO, and Pepe Jeans to Red Bull but the links are all on the site that cannot be named!

His first team was BMW Sauber. He had a slightly unusual route into F1 through several German series, but I believe it was actually BMW that funded his test driver seat because they wanted a German driver for their own F1 team. Of course by the time he was ready they were pulling out. 









 Thing is I don't see that Hamilton is putting himself in the spotlight in the way you suggest. You can't have a relationship with a major celebrity and not be in the spotlight no matter how hard you try. If you look at what he puts on instagram or twitter its pretty standard fair 




 It was Ron's second F2 team, Project 4, that took over McLaren rather than the other way around. The MP4 designation [originally meant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery) 'Marlboro Project 4', and was later changed to mean 'McLaren Project 4'. This only goes to show how deep the relationship with Philip Morris was.

Even now their current logo is a [stylised version of the Marlboro Chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) - because that's what they're most remembered for. 




 I was surprised! I knew Damon, Eddie Jordan (and I think DC) used to play pub rock together in bars after the races but I didn't know he'd recorded anything. 




 I think they only had two cameras and shared them around at each race - the damn things were so expensive back then. 




 Sorry. I was referring to his first F2 outfit Rondel Racing and the context wasn't clear - but you're correct, I got his age wrong, he was 26 at the time. 




 No problem - my context wasn't clear in any case.

My partner is Black as is my closest friend and as a result I've become more aware of the subtleties of racism, or what could better be described as racially motivated criticism, than I otherwise might have been. 

Much of the commentary directed at Hamilton carries a tone of 'otherness' with it - its seeking to highlight aspects of his character, tone, style, and personal behavior that are different than what is perceived to be the 'norm' if you see what I mean. If you want to undermine something you raise questions of validity and highlight things that are seen as outside the mainstream of opinion.

For example. You could say that 'Schumacher was a great driver, but not a great sportsman' - if you wanted to acknowledge the greatness but undermine the validity of his considerable achievements by attacking his character. 




 My example wasn't specific to Moss's comments - I had meant in general, sorry if that didn't come across. 

I'm also not labelling *any* criticism directed at Hamilton racist, much of it clearly isn't and I share your feelings on this. But, there is quite a lot flak sent in his direction over the gold chain he likes to wear, certain celebrity friends, flat peaked baseball cap, 'hip hop' (i.e. not specifically music but black music), etcetera. I do feel has a racial motivation behind it because, broadly, its highlighting behavior or ways of dressing that are common in the black community but not in others, and the tone of such commentary is always critical.

Equally when you compare the media and fan treatment of Mansell, Hill and Button (basically national treasures in this country) with the way Hamilton is spoken about the contrast is quite stark. Hamilton is arguably the most successful British racing driver ever to have hit an F1 track, yet the validity of his achievements is constantly questioned in a way that other recent British champion's haven't been. 




 Umm, the owners were Bruce McLaren and Bruce McLaren. In fact the first McLaren cars to appear in orange were their CanAm series cars, although they did make some customer cars for the series. 









 The point is that such things are used as a form of criticism of Hamilton, as /u/jimbodeeny demonstrated above when he said:

Probably something more like a racing driver Dan Blizerian than #blessed hip hop star Hamilton.

This kind of thing wouldn't be said in the same way about a white driver, its being used as a 'dog whistle' for less pleasant language and is clearly racially motivated. 

Damon Hill, for example, played guitar with George Harrison and Def Leopard while he was driving, in fact he appeared on the opening track of Def Leopard's 'Demolition Man' album. He and Eddie Jordan regularly played music together at post race events - this was never used as criticism at the time or since. 




 Schumacher [did not like Alonso](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2010/03/alonso-and-schumacher-renew-hostilities/) but respected him as a competitor. 




 Completely agree. 




 Yeah, it was interesting to learn Ferrari took a new engine for Bahrain. I don't think Mercedes are holding back, they're still learning the tyres and there is only so much power you can use at high temperature/humidity tracks without creating deficits elsewhere. RBR won with a relatively underpowered engine. 




 Yep. Its not good, and it makes me very sad. 

My grandparents lived into their mid-nineties and didn't say or believe things like this. Age doesn't make it acceptable to be sexist or racist - in my experience people who were remain so in old age. 




 Its good PR, makes some noise and collects a few column inches. 




 Nasr already has two junior championships a 2nd and two 3rds under his belt - those are better junior results than Rosberg (2 championships and one 2nd), and only one junior championship adrift of Schumacher (3 championships, one 2nd, one 3rd) at the same stage.

Yet he gets branded a pay driver? 




 Its the 'it's ok for old people to be a bit racist' argument. 

But it isn't. 

He's not dumb and he knows what he's saying is a long way out of touch with modern Britain. 




 In sheer terms of the number of F1 driver records held, the only people ahead of Hamilton (52) are Schumacher (100) and Vettel (72). 

He's already eclipsed Clark (36), Senna (37), Lauda (16), Prost (42), Mansell (29), Stewart (14), Fangio (37), Ascari (20), Hill (5), Hkkinen (17), Alonso (46) and many more. 

If that doesn't make him one of the great drivers of the sport then I don't know what does.  




 Yep. To be honest I'm disappointed in him, every time Moss opens his mouth on Lewis or women in motor racing something crass comes out. 

When people like the English Defence League are putting your quotes on T-Shirts you should wonder if your views aren't a little out of touch. 


"In those days we were proud to be English. It's different now, there's probably only about ten million of us Englishmen left. All the others have come in here from God knows where....."

On women in motorsport:

"We've got some very strong and robust ladies, but, when your life is at risk, I think the strain of that in a competitive situation will tell when you're trying to win. The mental stress I think would be pretty difficult for a lady to deal with in a practical fashion. I just don't think they have aptitude to win a Formula 1 race."
 




 That happened [yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/34szhw/arrivabene_why_do_i_need_hamilton_when_i_have/) 




 Being in a development program doesn't relieve young drivers of the need to bring sponsors with them into the program, or into teams at higher levels in the sport.  




 Lauda did the same thing! 



















 I agree. Team principal of his own F2 outfit at 26, and the most experienced team leader in the sport today. Always interesting to listen to what he has to say on matters. 




 22 years. Interestingly it was Emerson Fittipaldi that bought his personal sponsor Philip Morris to the the team and thats what led to the Marlboro McLaren livery and all that history. 









 Amazingly McLaren only used this livery for [four seasons](http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/blog/alan-henry/changing-face-mclaren-f1-car-liveries/) - yet its stuck in the fan consciousness.

The colour scheme was shortlived: McLaren only ran in orange F1 livery between 1968 and 1971, incorporated a notional orange streak into its Yardley-liveried cars of 72 and 73 and phased it out completely when Emerson Fittipaldi brought the full red-and-white might of Philip Morris Tobacco onboard when he joined for 1974.
 









 I thought he'd just lost the back on the straight, maybe hit some oil or a less grippy part of the track. As you say, odd.

Stunningly lucky marshall. 









 The more people know, the less happy they are. The curse of the information age.

 You get that you're actually costing the teams money, not Bernie? He only has a 5% share, even the controlling interest amounts to less than 35% profit share.

60% of all FOM revenue goes to the teams, which last year amounted to around $1.2 billion net.

 I seem to have created a monster.  









 I feel the same way about Bottas as I do about Magnussen, I just don't see them as contenders, their results on track don't seem to justify the hype. 

Anyone want to fill me on the cause of all the fandom? 




 The [video isn't any less terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1pJo3sLpVk) than the photos.

Only yesterday I was pointing out that of the 29 regular drivers that started the 1968 season alongside Jacky Ickx, 13 died racing or testing in the 7 or 8 years that followed (though only a few in F1). Driving was a brutal career in those days.

They were: McLaren, Rindt, Clark, Solana, Schlesser, Rodrguez, Spence, Scarfiotti, Bianchi, Siffert, Bonnier, Courage, and Moser.

In May 1967 Bandini was racing at the Monaco Grand Prix, running second to Denny Hulme on the 82nd lap, when he lost control of his car at the harbour chicane. He had just entered an S-turn when his Ferrari's left rear wheel hit the guard rail, sending him into an erratic skid. It impacted a light pole and overturned. The car hit straw bales which lined the harbour side, rupturing the fuel tank, and sparks ignited the fuel as the car rolled over, with Bandini trapped beneath it. Marshals flipped his car upright and pulled Bandini, unconscious, out from the flaming Ferrari. It is thought that, during the effort to right the overturned car, gasoline leaked on the hot brake line or the exhaust pipe and exploded. A second fire occurred when the gas tank exploded after Bandini had been pulled away from the Ferrari.

Bandini's burns were extensive, with third degree burns covering more than 70% of his body. The worst burns were on his arms and legs with slight burns on his face. Doctors were forced to wait for twenty-four to forty-eight hours before resolving to move Bandini to a hospital in Lyon, France, which specialized in the treatment of burns. Other options considered, by the doctors, were flying in skin grafts from Italy or a specialist burns unit team from East Grinstead in England. The burns caused severe lesions. He also sustained a chest wound and ten chest fractures.

Three days later, Bandini succumbed to his injuries. He died at Princess Grace Polyclinic Hospital in Monte Carlo. There were concerns about the promptness of Bandini's rescue. However, investigators from the Principality of Monaco ruled on 10 May "that the security operation had functioned properly." The straw bales, having been banned from all Formula 1 races in response to the accident, were replaced by an extended guard-rail the following year.

Bandini was buried in Reggiolo on 13 May. 100,000 people attended the funeral. 




 Thank you, I've fixed that!  




 Mercedes dropping away, or other teams catching up on their development depending on how you view it, in general thats the long term effect of the rule changes on the engineering side. There is basically one or two good ways to get the best out of x rule inside x car concept, and the competition is to see who can find and balance that against the rest of the car more quickly.

According to legend Hamilton was convinced by the factory tour, just as Alonso was by the same thing at Honda. Both appear have felt the engineering commitment sufficient to put them in contention for wins.

30 odd years watching says you can never count Ferrari out (for the first time in those years I have a positive view of Ferrari), and they appear to be on track for a good 2016. Personally I don't take the potential move seriously - but you never know. 




 Schumacher, Hamilton, Alonso, Button and a whole lot more all went to teams less successful than their previous one. Its not about the current season its about the next 3 - 5 years.

Also its Ferrari, even Hamilton said that only a fool wouldn't consider driving for the most successful team in F1 history, no matter the circumstances.

- Schumacher to Ferrari (Ferrari 3rd, Benetton 2nd in 1995)
- Hamilton to Mercedes ~~(Mercedes 4th, McLaren 2nd in 2011)~~ (Mercedes 5th, McLaren 3rd in 2012)
- Alonso to McLaren (McLaren 3rd, Renault 1st in 2006)
- Button to McLaren (McLaren 3rd, Brawn 1st in 2009) 




 Tell that to Seb, and Schumacher. But you're missing the point of what I said. 




 Neither is more important than the other. If you want to watch a spec series, there are plenty to choose from. 









 I'm really looking forward to this race, especially as its around the corner. Nice price too. 




 I don't know. I wonder if they need to go back to the car concept drawing board, 2014 seems to have wrong footed them, its easy to blame the power unit, but their problems are self evidently more than skin deep. 

The engine installation seems to be off, mapping, brakes, balance, the car seems to be a dog. I also have to say that IMO the attitude of the team management is helping their cause at all, and it may be time for a change.

I do hope that you're right though. 




 Absolutely, but it appears to me that its the power delivery rather than than the bhp that is the real difference. Merc had by far the best power unit in the two years preceding 2014, but didn't have the chassis to match it. But they were focussing on 2014 and little else.

I'm not counting RBR out in the slightest and I believe they'll get a lot out of the B spec car, but I don't think they'll be racing at the front because of it. Will certainly enjoy finding out though. 




 I disagree. Even now, after 14 years driving, Kimi is one of the fastest drivers in the business, and has driven 40+ of the fastest laps ever achieved in F1 races - he deserves his seat. 

One year of bad performance doesn't erase his career. Especially when you consider he's racing three drivers who hadn't even hit puberty when he first got into F1. 




 I've sat through the same [expletive deleted] arguments about Hill/Schumacher, Mansell/Hill, Hill/Coulthard, Prost/Senna and dozens of other driver competitions and team pairings. 

You don't get to be a four time WDC winner and beat Webber consistently by accident.

Seb is a great driver, and I'm having a lot of fun watching he and Kimi race.  




 Indeed - that's what I mean - it appears that Ferrari chose to invest their time and money in other parts of the car rather than chase the short nose. You'd have to say that decision paid off for them.  




 According to your underlying theory Seb couldn't handle a bad car and his results suffered (which was still 5th in the WDC, not shabby at all by anyone's standards), but Riccardo could drive the same bad car to success because he's the better driver.

Hows that theory working out for you this season?  




 I'll bet Ferrari are holding their updates until after Monaco - the package they have right now seems well optimised for the hotter races and could do very well there, especially with their excellent cooling setup. 

Interestingly Ferrari don't seem [bothered by the short nose](http://www.espn.co.uk/f1/story/_/id/12622228/james-allison-explains-ferrari-nose-design). Red Bull were having issues with the crash tests and, I guess, built the car with that kind of nose in mind. Perhaps that's why they're expecting such large gains from it. Ferrari seem to created have a different car concept entirely, rather than investing a lot of staff time into a crash tests and such.

I do wonder if there wasn't a price elsewhere on the RBR car for getting the short nose done. 
























 Livery change confirmed. Hello Jennifer. 



















 I'd left Hulme out only because he lived to an age, even though he died racing, he survived his era so-to-speak. 

Obviously you're correct. I'd tried to phrase it so it was clear-ish (i.e. racing or testing without qualifying the series) that relatively few died in F1 cars but didn't succeed! It was commonplace, even expected, in that era to drive in multiple series though. 

Its an awful list, and that was just one season's drivers, almost all were dead before 1975. Sad. 




 I bet it's ultra contemporary , non cluttered

[Nope](http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/ron-dennis-house/view/bing/) more castle like. 




 That's because SAP is a team sponsor, but they're one of a shrinking number, and only three of 10 teams on the grid have a title sponsor right now (Sahara don't count as they own 40% of the team).

What SAP specifically get is proof their cloud solution works in one of the worlds most data intensive professions, and their competitors in that field, Microsoft, also sponsor F1 extensively. But SAP's real involvement is with McLaren Technology group and their F1 and road car computer systems.

However none of that is what we're talking about at all. Sponsors are increasingly funding younger drivers as a low cost, high value, route into the sport. Santander for example funded young Alonso - he took their personal sponsorship to McLaren (and left them there, where they picked up Button), and to Ferrari, where he again left them. Maldonado bought in PDVSA who are major sponsors of his old team and new one. Teams very often give slots on the car to drivers management to place, and increasingly so. 




 Most of the drivers that competed alongside him died that way, in that era you had less than 40% shot at surviving your racing career. Many successful drivers walked away after a WDC win, not wanting to chance their luck any further.

Ickx, started in F1 1968. Of the 29 drivers that completed more than one race in that season 13 died racing or testing in the years that followed - 46% of them. They were McLaren, Rindt, Clark, ~~Hill,~~ Solana, Schlesser, Rodrguez, Spence, Scarfiotti, Bianchi, Siffert, Bonnier, Courage, and Moser. 

Edit: As /u/meowlong points out, not all of these drivers were killed in F1, but its worth saying that this is because it was commonplace at the time to race in multiple series. This isn't a comment on F1 safety specifically. 




 Yeah. Its tricky to find pictures because most of the race photos are black and white or so grainy the grey/silver looks white. But I beleive thats him! 




 Here's a shot of [Fangio driving the Mercedes W196](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One#/media/File:Gro%C3%9Fer_Preis_von_Europa_-1954_N%C3%BCrburgring,_Juan_Manuel_Fangio,_Mercedes_(3)x.JPG) in the 1954 German Grand Prix. Fangio won two drivers championships with the team.

The 'Silver Arrows' name came from their domination of the old Grand Prix series in the 1930s, and they entered F1 in 1954 with Fangio switching from Maserati to join the team and immediately dominated the 54' and 55' seasons winning everything in sight. Sterling Moss partnered Fangio in 1955.

This should also sound familiar, past is prologue for Mercedes!

Sadly it was the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR that [went airborne and killed 79](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMoh5hZAaZk) people after hitting the back of Lance Macklin's Austin-Healey at the 1955 Le Mans, their Magnesium Alloy body work increasing the severity of the post accident fire. The crash wasn't their fault, but they took the hit for it, and withdrew from all motorsport afterwards. 




 He can, but most vary rather than change. 

If you think that drivers have nothing to do with sponsors then you simply haven't been paying attention to how the sport actually works in this era. The whole point of sponsoring young drivers is to gain entry along with them to the top level of motorsport. 




 Yes you can. Changing liveries is connected to sponsors, which funds more and better development, ergo liveries do have an impact on performance. 




 I highly doubt it. Project 4 bought the McLaren team rather than the other way around, plus when you look back at the logos through the years its clear where the chevron came from 




 [This car](http://www.historyofmotorsport.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lemans-1966.jpg) 




  Who owns the Hill helmet config?

Damon Hill - which is the point. The sport needs to improve driver branding, because that's the main method by which sponsors are coming to the sport these days.

It's ridiculous no matter what excuse you use.

Only if you have no idea how marketing actually works and how sponsors are coming to the sport.
 




 More people does not equal better work or more productivity, in fact the adding more people just delays projects further. See the [The Mythical Man-Month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month). 




 It does today, but not [originally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery). 




 They [altered the meaning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery) after Malboro left the team to McLaren Project Four, but it originally meant Marlboro Project Four (I beleive Marlboro funded the chasis development).

Even today the Mclaren logo is a stylised version of the [Marlboro chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) 




 Nope, that's failing to understand what Ron actually said.

Why would the team go *back* to a livery that they have barely used in the modern era, in fact a livery that they only used for two years, and has little association with the team for most fans - what would it get them? 

Even now their current logo is a [stylised version of the Marlboro Chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) - because that's what they're most remembered for.

However, most people now associate the team with the silver/grey livery so they made a decision to stick with it and add in some Honda branding, the black appears to have been part of a deal with Johnnie Walker or SAP that fell through looking at their previous sponsor branding. But really the whole thing was a message to Honda and to sponsors - we're willing to change it, but you need to get on board and pay us in order to do so.

FYI the silver colour is for Mercedes, West's branding always appears on a white background. 




 Nope. They want drivers to have the same helmets because the drivers are the driving force behind team sponsorship these days (Alonso brought Santander in, Maldonado PDVSA, Hamilton got Bombardier and IWC in the door, Will Stevens has the sponsor slots at Manor). 

Basically the driver's 'brands' have become more important to the sport than the team brands and one thing F1 can do to support that is increase the association between drivers and their helmets thus strengthening their brands. Fixed driver numbers is a tilt at the same thing. 




 I find the commentary a bit difficult, always seems so casual to me compared to F1. 




 Can you give me the 101 on what a superspeedway is exactly - I've never really understood the track types. 




 If you like big numbers then this is the way to go, but it won't solve any of the problems that the sport actually has - only make them worse. 




 At no point in F1's history has that ever been true. 137 official constructors since 1950, and only 10 remain. The vast majority of F1 teams are there surviving. The median average F1 team competes in 20 races for three seasons, uses 5 drivers, wins no races and scores no points. 




 That livery was really the result of the Marlboro sponsorship - even the MP4 designation meant Marlboro Project Four at the time.

Project Four was Ron Dennis's old team, he did a reverse takeover of McLaren.

Edit: Downvoters, [you're wrong about this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery), the meaning was altered after Marlboro left the team. Even today the Mclaren logo is a stylised version of the [Marlboro chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) 














 Love the attitude from Claire - every inch her father's daughter. 
























 We came close to doing that in 1994 - banned all of the traction and driver aids that 'purist' fans said were ruining the racing, and had little in the way of meaningful aero - look what happened. 

Sincerely, the cars were simply too quick and powerful to be controllable in general, and even modestly safe when something went wrong. Senna's death disguises a [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSI27en56tg) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yUxMLIbtIk) [terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xumw9c5j-3A) [accidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd-nSWjdpHI) and on track [incidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxMtYyNZ6Q) during 1994 that are rarely talked of anymore. The pit lane speed limits, and downforce reduction measures we see today all came from that season's racing.

"Its going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesnt happen." - Ayrton Senna, during the 94' pre-season.

The 94' season left two drivers dead, one in a coma, one seriously injured marshall, five injured spectators, and a seriously injured ferrari mechanic. 




 There never has been a period in F1's history where anything resembling unlimited racing occurred. 









 Button to Mercedes confirmed ;o) 
























 Frankly I'm not the one being a dick about it and straight downvoting other people's posts every day. If you have a problem with what I'm posting or the way I'm posting it then contact the mods, otherwise just move along and read someone else's content.

But personally I'm very tired of hearing from you, you're *not* the content police. 




 Its only a repost if you don't actually *read* the article, which you routinely don't.  

But apparently I'm going through another /u/musef1 bitching phase. Nevermind, I can't be arsed with bitches today.

/get off my lawn 




 There were 4 other 180 mph crashes at Tamburello in the years leading up to Senna's crash - all drivers survived with the worst injury being a severe concussion. Its a flat out corner with a river behind it, hence the concrete wall. Arguably the severity of Bergers crash foreshadowed Senna's but all of the crashes involved some kind of technical failure, and all look very similar.

- [Piquet 87'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLyAKkeA25Q); 
- [Patrese 92'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCcf_aTuldY) ; 
- [Berger 89'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVxnkaqqO2c); 
- [Alboreto 91'](http://flatoutcombr.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/alboretocrash.jpg). 

Which is all by way of saying that Senna crash led to F1 managing downforce and thereby speed, but all of that was really a consequence of the driver aids ban. In many important respects the FW14B remains the most technically advanced F1 car ever created.

Both deaths led to the HANS device as they were both on a [long list of drivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HANS_device#History) that sustained basilar skull fractures. Senna's death wasn't caused by the skull fracture though. 

















































 I think what you say is fair comment, but if you think back to the commentary of those races there was always a clear separation between the teams shod by one manufacturer. The problem that led to Michelin leaving was that they were getting bad PR for always being worse than the other supplier. 




 With cost controls come limitations - it really is that simple. 

Any team will argue in a meeting that x rule is fine so long a we outlaw x behavior because that will drive costs. I do also think that newer fans tend to believe historic grand prix had less rules and were therefore purer - that isn't necessarily the case. 




 As I said nine hours ago:

Based on what you had to say there is no point in disagreeing with you - there isn't anything anyone could say to you that would deter you from these uninformed talking points.

And so it has proved to be true.
 




 I did address your points in my first reply to your comment, the rest has just been you blustering along trying to pretend that you didn't lose the argument first time out. The links you've add here are not verifiable data - they prove nothing of what you originally stated.

To paraphrase a famous winner 'please proceed Mr DevilishRogue' 




 We tried it during the tyre war. Essentially one manufacturer's gets it right, the other doesn't, and any team using the latter's tyres suffers badly. Basically it ruins the racing and leads to nonsense like the [2005 US Grand Prix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_tyres#2005_United_States_Grand_Prix_controversy) 




 Basically, robbed of the DM and the DT you can't substantiate any of your claims with actual facts. 

There is a reason for that. 




 No. What I've provided to you is facts and examples backed up by verifiable data and foundational economic principles that are known and used for decision making worldwide.

What you have provided is fact free bluster, the usual kiptard whining because your opinion isn't demonstrable fact, the world doesn't work like you think it should, and your corporate welfare ridden bibles the DM and the DT can't be used to substantiate the price of fish. 




 Still fact free blustering I see.

Typical DM reader.  




 It doesn't matter - graduates will still earn more money through their lifetimes than those with a lower qualification. The average graduate salary is 31,041 compared to 17,899 for non-graduates even if they are working in non-graduate jobs.

The number of official graduate places in the workforce is not an argument against obtaining a degree level education. 




 Once you look at [the productivity numbers](http://static.squarespace.com/static/541ff5f5e4b02b7c37f31ed6/5429942de4b0455e57050a1b/542994cde4b0455e57053198/1412011213400/Measures-of-productivity-2-2003-12.png?format=original) its quite clear when productivity fell. 

Young people tend to be hit hardest by a recession and recruitment for that generation never returns, hence the 'lost generation' of the 90's and 2008. 

But we're also in the bottom three countries in the OECD rankings, our oldest workers have better and more marketable skills than our youngest, and the fault there is the fall in university places combined with the rise in the cost of education. Both of these factors are a drag on productivity. 





























 No worries! 




 She's been an Assembly Member for 16 years, and just announced she's standing down. So I suspect she might offer a highly informed perspective on the coming campaign. 




 Might be also be useful to see if Val Shawcross would be up for an AMA, we and the AM candidates might learn a thing or two. 




 The number of Graduate positions is immaterial to the benefits to the individual and the wider economy of obtaining a degree.

95% of all degree graduates get a job, the average graduate salary is 31,041 compared to 17,899 for non-graduates even if they are working in non-graduate jobs. 

Salaries for every kind of education below degree, including the vocational courses and apprenticeships are much lower [Source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-333261).

Even the much hated on 'Media Studies' has a 93% employment rate, second only to medicine - that's a better figure than Engineering or Architecture graduates.

Biased nonsense from the DM or DT isn't proof of anything, examine the actual data for yourself without the righty spin. Consider also that just because you had this experience in the employment market, not everyone else does.

 




 Thanks! I was only aware of three of them before I got this email, a surprisingly wide field 




 Still with the factless quoted blustering I see.

Your opinion on education policy is simply wrong. The current government's own figures show that to be the case as does the experience of every other developed country on the planet. Degree education is the path to growth and improvement in living standards.

The target of your ire, media studies, actually has the second best employment prospects in the country but you still can't admit you're wrong. 




 As I said there is no point in disagreeing with you - the reason a bunch of people downvoted you without replying is that no one wanted to be bothered with this whole quoted nonsense.

In any case, I provided a well argued refutation of your original points, and you've not managed to provide anything substantial in response but blustery factless nonsense.

Incidentally in 2013 among those who completed their course Media Studies has a 93% employment rate, second only to medicine. 

95% of all degree graduates get a job, the average graduate salary is 31,041 compared to 17,899 for non-graduates even if they are working in non-graduate jobs. Salaries for every kind of education below degree, including the vocational courses you reccomend are much lower [Source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-333261).

See, that's a source, not the biased claptrap trotted out by the DM and DT.

By the way, you complained of being downvoted but are still downvoting me because you disagree with what I have to say.

 




 The point is that despite knowing nothing at all about any of these departments actually do you assume these talking points are true because pavlov style you've been trained to believe that and trot out the DM style responses. The sheer ignorance of all of your comments above show that to be true.

Also you can reply to a comment without quoting every single line of it.  




 You think there are a limited number of graduate jobs because that's the only metric you're looking at. The present decline in those positions is mainly down to the long term effect of 2008 and the increase in unpaid or low paid internships for those leaving education - most of these positions are being funded by the benefits system.

Degree education improves your *lifetime* earning power - not just the few years after you leave university. It doesn't matter if you get a graduate job or not you still earn more from the moment you hit the employment market.

 Its looking more and more like the IDS/Hague/Howard period where the Tories kept electing ideologically pure candidates because it didn't recognise that electorate had changed.
 




 I think they expected a Tory minority government. When you examine the changes they made in the fixed term parliament act - removing dissolution of parliament for a defeated queens speech, defeated major legislation and the like they clearly had in mind the problems faced by the Major government. 




 Based on what you had to say there is no point in disagreeing with you - there isn't anything anyone could say to you that would deter you from these uninformed talking points.

To be brief: 

Lower educational numbers are a drag on productivity, even Osborne recognises this. Courses that you apparently don't consider valid (possibly because your interest is in dismissing the label rather than understanding the course) result in higher earnings and higher economic productivity in the long term - this directly affects GDP and the nature of the courses doesn't actually matter, its the level of study alone that works.

The same is true in employment related courses - the Farage favorite of stable hand qualifications and hairdressing courses. These improve wages and enable employment mobility i.e. if you can demonstrate your experience on paper you stand a much better chance of getting a better job with better pay. FYI a qualified salon colourist able to mix their own dyes earns 90 per hour, the reason it's a BSc course and not a BA is that a substantial part of a colourists job is chemistry.

The bloated middle management talking point is simply nonsense when discussing an organisation with 1.6 million staff. Small numbers of senior management can't possibly make decisions with enough focus to run an organisation on that scale without middle management - the same is true in any large private sector organisation. The example you cite '5 a day coordinator' may seem silly to you but the organisational role is about improving preventative healthcare and education i.e. saving money before it's spent.

International aid is 10 billion in a 700 billion budget. This is a talking point because some people don't like who its spent on and lack the wit to understand why it's spent and what benefit the country derives from it. For example, DFID was a major donor to the LUBILOSA Programme which developed a biological pesticide for locust control in Sahel zone across Africa. This developed a commercial product in conjunction with British scientists (which provided funding to British Universities) and was commercialised as a product by British and French companies. So this one programme created jobs in the UK, provided jobs and experience for graduate scientists, improved the agricultural output of a swath of Africa (which assists in famine prevention and thereby reduces emergency aid in the long term), and resulted in British and French companies creating lasting partnerships.

I appreciate that these things seem daft to you, but the fault lies in your understanding of what's happening and it's outputs, not the way the money is being spent. Perhaps look at the world through another lens rather than DT/DM headlines. 





























 Both men seem to have gained an appreciation for what their collective hubris cost them in 2007. 

Ron lost control of the team that represents his life's work, Alonso lost a guaranteed shot at four further WDC's, and results that were at least as good as Ferrari's, potentially better with him in the car.

So I suspect that, older and wiser, they really have set aside their differences because they both need each other very badly indeed. Neither has any other move left. 









 He isn't wrong, apparently fear of a functioning democracy in Scotland is a major driver for English voters, which is simply sad.

The problem amongst the LibDem's appears to be that the parliamentary party views the coalition as a heroic effort to save the country from a minority government whereas their voters simply view them as traitors. 

When the Libs lost 25% of their membership post the tuition fees fiasco, or when they were annihilated in the council elections two years ago you'd have thought they would have reversed course and thought about their supporters - apparently not - equally apparently the parliamentary party don't seem to have changed their view of the coalition since the election. 




 The weight and number of the fuel rigs that have to be moved around. The fuel is mostly shipped by their fuel suppliers. 




 Yesterday was the day when everyone officially announced their candidacy. I'd have preferred an email with some more information, but completely understand the approach. 




 Yep. Also an email from Tessa Jowell. I'll be supporting the Tessa - more info [here](http://www.tessa.london/). I like Sadiq but I'd rather see him in the Shadow Justice Secretary role. 









 Vettel gets [33.7 million in the first season](http://www.totalsportek.com/f1/sebastian-vettel-ferrari-contract-worth-240-million/) but much less in the following two, Alonso is apparently on [25 million a season](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/jenson-button/11288225/Jenson-Buttons-salary-slashed-but-McLaren-driver-is-raring-to-fight-for-world-title-again.html) 









 Whatever billionaire you're talking about according to the press, especially the MOS, they're corrupt. 

Most of the people complaining, just as you are, are sore because they were on the wrong end of a deal and didn't get what they wanted or what they thought they were due. Thems the breaks. Ultimately you have no proof of anything merely a bunch of tabloid gossip and the usual heroes and villains narrative. 




 Refueling rigs are expensive to buy, you need a team of four additional people to maintain and operate them during the race, further people on the FIA end to inspect them, people to pack them up, more people back at base to optimise the fuel delivery, additional vehicles to transport them to and from the airport or seaport, and the air and sea freight is expensive.

The teams, according to RBR, have five versions of their race setup on the ocean or in the air at any one time. So its not just one rig you need to buy five. They also have two versions of their pit crew so thats at least eight additional staff to hire, transport and accomodate.

There is also additional work, parts, and maintenance on the cars to consider, and more work for the team's own safety officers.

In any form of business staff are always the most expensive component.  














 Heroes and Villains mate. Everyone else is always the innocent hero in F1 deal and Bernie is always the evil villain. Funny thing is the world generally doesn't operate that way. 




 You're claiming Bernie wanted a bribe, that sounds terribly corrupt, when in fact was he was offering was a deal to stage a race.

Grands Prix are mostly run on 10 year contracts, so offering a resign at the 8 year stage is pretty reasonable especially if the commercial environment has changed - in the case of Adelaide the transport fees had increased steeply thanks to the oil market. So, as **you** said, they were offered a deal, dithered over it, and lost the GP and lost as a result. 




 Basically in F1 the manufacturers pay for the racing and form the basis of the grid. They subsidised 50% of the cost of the engines in the V8 formula, and they're still heavily subsidising the cost now. Without the manufacturers the sport simply wouldn't exist. The foundation of the current Formula was laid the day BMW exited saying this:

Premium [brands] will increasingly be defined in terms of sustainability and environmental compatibility. This is an area in which we want to remain in the lead. In line with our Strategy Number ONE, we are continually reviewing all projects and initiatives to check them for future viability and sustainability. Our Formula One campaign is thus less a key promoter for us - Norbert Reithofer

In other words the sports strategy needed to change, particularly in the light of the global recession, in order to keep the manufacturers we did have and hopefully attract new ones. 




 You can find all of those things in other series - IMO it sounds like you'd enjoy Indy more than F1. 




 I see - in your mind 'race fee' is equal to a 'bribe'. Got it.

FOM pays for all the safety work, FIA oversight, stewards, medical staff, transport and shipping, hotels, basically the cost of getting the personnel and the show to the venue and back. But mainly 60% of its revenue forms the prize money the teams get - so when you support a team calling for more money you also support increasing the race fee.

In short Melbourne outbid Adelaide. By your own admission they were offered a deal to resign but dithered over it and Bernie went to Melbourne who wanted the race more. Business is business. 




 In other words Adelaide couldn't make up its mind about the level of support and lost the race - how does this constitute Bernie taking a bribe? 




 No matter what room he's in Galloway is always the biggest cunt in it. 




 He brokers the deals, and he's pretty bloody good at it. No one would have F1 without him, and F1 will miss him very much when he's gone, its just going to take a while for people to realise that. 




 He made it, he gets to do mostly what he wants with it, and for the most part he's looked after his bit it pretty well. 

Personally all I see is a bunch of armchair quarterbacks who have little idea about the realities being faced crying because they didn't get the rules mix they thought would solve all of their issues. I've listened to it for nearly four decades, and no matter what solution is offered someone is always sore, someone else claims it isn't proper racing, and it'll all be Bernie's fault no matter who made the decision or what governing structures were in place. 

But really this whole thing is about rich teams, rich manufacturer's, rich team owners and slightly richer business people making a deal where everyone gets a bit of what they wanted.

Big business is corrupt full stop, its less corrupt than it used to be, but it just is and saying you want one rich guy to die isn't really changing anything is it?

What will Bernie's death change anyway? FOM doesn't dictate the rules, Bernie rarely gets everything he wants (which if you listen to the details is often more in touch with what the fans want than the teams). Bernie will be replaced and things will carry on.  




 Neither of those teams had a $1 billion dollar business supporting the them, and neither of those teams had a Ferrari engine, parts, and support. Looking at how competitive Sauber have been so far this season I don't think they're stretching the truth. 




 Why on earth would you wish for someone's death just because you disagree with them? 




 Because we'd like to have engines made by people with expertise in cutting edge engine technology rather than some 30 year old design cobbled together because it sounds good and the bhp meets the arbitrary expectations of large number fetishists  














 I think Mercedes new safety car includes concepts from the W05 engine? 




 The 2002 Arrows A23 chassis carried on through two further teams and was racing again in 2006. Stoddart discarded it after buying the IP, and from there it went to SuperAguri.

I don't have a problem with the customer car effort. It's hard getting a team established financially and anything that can bring in teams, and allow them the financial space to get going and develop, will help the sport in the long term.  




 /u/trollabot 














 The sporting rules contain a list of parts that must be produced in house - the list exists to prevent customer cars. 



















 I'm not disagreeing your statement about the individual cars - the elements of the coke bottle design were evident throughout the late 70s and early 80s grid in their evolutionary forms. But the MP4/4 and 4/5 along with the 640 really kicked off the shape of the cars to come, and spread the design downgrid. 














 Done. 









 Hulkenberg had the most consistent junior career, but his results are only comparable with Hamilton's at 5 championships each. I beleive Hamilton remains one of the very few drivers to have won every series he's entered. 




 By junior championship win's: 

Grosjean (7), Hamilton (5), Hulkenberg (5), Massa (4), Alonso (3), Bottas (3), Nasr (3), Maldonado (3), Ricciardo (2), Raikkonen (2), Sainz (2), Kvyat (2), Rosberg (2), Ericsson (2), Button (2), Magnussen (2), Vettel (1), Verstappen (1), Prez (1), Merhi (1), Stevens (0).

For comparison Schumacher had 3 junior championships.

Availability of race seats matters though - Raikkonen, Verstappen, and Vettel barely competed in the junior categories. Its not a hard and fast rule, but RBR drivers tend to have shorter junior carrers because RBR have 4 seats in F1 and promote/discard quickly. 




 Schumacher won 3 junior championships, as did Alonso, which is only one championship adrift of Nico Rosberg(2) and Nasr (2) for comparison's sake. Hamilton and Hulkenberg, by contrast, won 5 championships each.  




 The 6 month leadership election fight in 2010 allowed Cameron and Osborne the space, assisted by Liam Byrne's idiotic letter, to define the recession as local rather than global. 

A public keen for someone to blame lapped up the message as it played into the general air of incompetence that had built up around Brown. 

It remains to be seen if the current leadership cycle will allow the Tories to define us again, but the large number of candidates isn't helping. 














 Sure. I'm not disagreeing with your statement about the individual cars - the elements of the coke bottle design were evident throughout the late 70s and early 80s grid in their evolutionary form. But the MP4/4 and 4/5 along with the 640 really kicked off the shape of the cars to come, and spread the design downgrid. 




 Yep, and with better production values. 




 True, but neither are entirely recognisable as a modern F1 car, and not everybody went that way. McLaren and Ferrari got it right in 88/89 and then everyone else followed suit - hence my title. 




 In the overwhelming majority of theatres profit isn't a consideration at all. 

The only way most shows get staged is through fund raising, the arts council, or other charities. Profit left the building 30 years ago. 




 Speaking as a former Theatre pro, there isn't really a problem with the industry. People outside the major cities, especially young people, simply stopped going to the theatre for fun in large enough numbers for it to be sustainable. In an environment where there is so much competition for the entertainment  rep theatre simply lost (so did pubs and the music industry, but that's another story).

Rising costs to the public in terms of tickets, transport, food and drink, obviously didn't help. The fact that the sheer effort involved in organising an evening out increased as working hours lengthened is also a factor, as is parents keeping teens on a tighter leash. But the reality is you can stick a good HBO show on your HD TV, or download a good movie for 4 and be just as entertained as going out to the theatre without any hassle. In fact you can be *reliably* entertained, and the same can't be said for rep theatre.

The result is virtually the only shows that are sustainable are large scale musicals, pantomimes, and new writing (things you can't watch on the TV at home). That being the case basically all the rep theatres are closing or merging and all that remains are regional receiving houses and even those are under threat.

People do love the idea of the theatre, they simply don't go it and then act unhappy when the local theatres close. Theatre seems to be entertainment for *other* people. 




 Scottish union members are almost certainly going to leave Labour for the SNP this year, particularly as we're going to get wiped out in the Scottish parliamentary elections - we've had a declining vote share up there since 2003 - something the English party has simply ignored. 









 Its easy to be cynical about this, but the electorate has apparently changed significantly which is why the pollster's models didn't work.

The [election results show](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9418) that Labour areas became more polarized and the same thing happened in Conservative areas. Previously Liberal areas went Blue en masse, and the downward Labour trend in Scotland since 2003 accelerated massively. 

It's going to be fascinating finding out what exactly has changed and the drivers behind it. 









 It is of course, but electric cars powered by self generation or mains electricity are far cleaner because the emissions can be effectively controlled and the generation type includes a far stronger renewable component.  




 He's facing a political reality where there are two main right wing parties in England that hate him and one main left wing party that merely dislikes him quite a bit. 

So I suspect comments like this are, as you say, him trying to appear relevant to his members.

All that said, he isn't wrong in what he said, and the fault lies in the failure of the party to bring the Unions with it as it progressed over the last 50 years. Something that's simply resulted in the Unions becoming more and more extremist as the party has moderated. 




 The point being that engine costs were going to increase substantially when the cost cap arrangement ended in any case. 

Most fan argument places the V8 cost at 8 million, ignores the subsidisation and its impending end, and argues the cost of the new engines is 20 million (which is still a subsidised cost) is too high and the increase too great for the non-works teams to bear. In reality the V6 formula is only a small amount more expensive than the V8 formula would have been without Mosley's cost cap.

Essentially the fan argument contends one group of rich people (the teams) is more deserving of cost reduction than another group of rich people (the manufacturers) and expects the latter to pick up the tab for the former, whilst conveniently ignoring the fact that they have been paying for the sport's existence for a long time. 

The wider point is that the manufacturers and teams do not make a profit from being in F1 directly - it's a marketing platform for virtually everyone except Sauber and Manor. Every successful outfit has a strong underlying business, all of the so called 'minnows' do not, and it's telling that Williams resurgence is closely aligned with its development of a technology business.

Of the 137 official F1 constructors that participated since 1950 only 10 remain active - costs and rules were a problem in 1950, and they remain a problem today. Realistically the sport needs to look hard at what is and isn't a successful business model for a team when it considers new entrants.  









 It was an FIA led deal negotiated by Mosley. F1 got cost capped engines, the manufacturers were allowed to supply more teams.

Google FIA Mosley Cost Cap if you'd like to know more, although this is being discussed elsewhere in the thread. 




 In effect they subsidise the sport. They make back from the sport about half of what they spend on being in it. F1 is a marketing platform for them. 









 F1 teams were, and still are, receiving subsidised engines and the v8 version of that deal expired. The v8s actual cost was around 16 million as season, but the teams got the engines for 8 million. So the terms of cost reduction in much of the fan argument are very relativistic. 




 It really depends what new technology eliminates when you want to claim something is dirty vs something else. Hydrogen, for example, is extraordinarily inefficient when compared to batteries [here's Elon Musk explaining why](https://youtu.be/Y_e7rA4fBAo?t=10m21s). 

Between Tesla and Apple battery technology has improved dramatically in just 8 years.

Home batteries that can charge overnight and power the home during the day have arrived. This reduces demand, which eliminates power stations, and makes them cleaner than the current solution. 

Every car manufacturer has gone hybrid, and cars will be mainly electrically powered within the decade. That eliminates not only fossil fuels, but the transport systems that support its delivery, and the environmental damage caused by its discovery, refining and extraction. Because of this batteries are actually cleaner than current solutions. 




 The ignorance displayed by some fans over the v6 engine move, noise issue and fuel saving is quite simply astonishing.

 














 Labour led four Lab/Lib coalitions in the Scottish Parliament, each garnering less and less support until the 2007 wipeout. Of the 73 constituencies in Scotland, only 20 are now represented parties other than the SNP. Labour had to rely on regional lists to get its seats the last time around.

The evidence suggests that trend will continue in 2016. 

IMO you're completely right, it would have been had we had the sense to send some of our best back to Scotland or keep them there in the first place. Sadly Westminster was always the priority.  




 Its very easy to say that, particularly with justifiable disdain for the other political parties involved. But members in Scotland quite rightly ask what did our support for those MP's and Prime Minister's deliver *for* Scotland - I hear the same questions asked in the North of England. I can't point to anything, can you?

I chuckle a little as I hear the millennial generation criticised for being selfish and self absorbed by a generation that bought them up that way, it throws the 'small britain' politics of the day into sharp relief. Everyone seems deeply concerned that someone else is getting something they're not. No one believes their voices are being heard or their issues attended to, I don't see the party offering a solution to that narrative as the different wings sharpen their sticks for the leadership election, merely playing to it. 




 While I have every respect for Murphy and the work he's done, it would have been better effected two or three years ago, perhaps 20 years ago. 

One has to ask what the Scottish contingent of Labour MP's were working on for the last few years that was more important than working *in* Scotland? 

If the truth is (as I suspect) that the leadership and the Scottish contingent did not realise the work was necessary until halfway through indyref, then we deserve what happened north of the border. 




 In 1996, around four hours after registering at uni in Edinburgh, I found myself listening to Alex Salmond speak. All of the main parties had been invited to student hustings to encourage party registration but only Salmond turned up.

Already being a Labour member (grandson of trade unionists, I had a lifetime membership three months after conception) I was campaigning for the devolution referendum a year later. What I found was quite shocking. The branches barely met, had no policy ideas, and mainly operated as a poorly attended social club. 

On the doorstep allegations of 'red tory' were common and you would really struggle to disagree with them - the elite of Scotland were all Labour voters and had no interest dealing with the extraordinary poverty on the sink estates surrounding the major cities or the complexities of life in remote communities.

By 1999 Dewar had returned from Westminster to lead the Scottish Assembly. He was a popular figure, but many in the party struggled with the fact that he had left Scotland for career, like so many other young people, and was only now returning for a coronation. Just like Murphy, Cook, Brown, Darling, the list is endless.

Listening to a friend who had gone to Scotland for the independence campaign describe the state of the party in Scotland it was clear to me nothing had changed. The leadership could best be described as the 'z' team, many in the party supported independence, the branches remained social clubs, and the members were disengaged from a campaign that had nothing to offer *for* Scotland but 'their figures are wrong', 'don't do something you'll regret'.

Alex Salmond wanted the referendum date, Cameron wanted straight Yes or No, Labour wanted DevoMax. Salmond and Cameron did a deal and placed Labour in a trap, and we walked straight into it without a second thought. 

Neither Unionist party could present a positive vision for Scotland via a new Scotland Act so Darling waged an entirely negative campaign fighting for the status quo with vague promises of a new settlement after 2015. Communities were divided, friends and families stopped speaking to each other - a deep anger bubbled to the surface. Quite obviously the 'victory' was pyrrhic - literally bonfire of the vanities.

Parachuting in Murphy at the last minute with nothing new to offer was just more of the same garbage that Scottish voters had been hearing for the last half century and I'm not at all surprised it didn't work.

If Labour wants its voice heard in Scotland again it needs to be a voice *from* Scotland speaking to England fighting for Scottish issues and not the other way around. We need a strong Scottish Labour party that believes in the union and can say in a single sentence why the union is worthwhile. The exact same thing is true in Wales. If we can't provide those voices then independence should happen now. 









 Farage was attempting a similar stunt to the Labour 'stone' when the crash happened - flying a plane with a banner on it in an attempt to get free media coverage. 

Lets just say that the stunt exceeded expectations. 









 Probably why Farage crashed his plane! 




 If you want to get a party message into a print media that will only print negative stories about your campaign, then something like this works very well indeed. The press print the photo with the message intact and it's free media from there on. 

Whomever you're opposing doesn't matter, because the people open to the message, in this case 'promises set in stone' unlike the current government, will get it. 




 This is a media trick designed to deal with overwhelming negative coverage in the media. 

Basically Labour couldn't get any positive message into the print media, so it tried the immigration mug. All of the press printed the photo of the mug complete with the 'strong on immigration' message, and from that point on the tone of the story didn't matter, the voters read the message.

The stone was a step too far, but again the media printed the picture with the messages on it intact. Had Labour won it would have been quite a clever way of getting 'promises set in stone', which is a wedge issue with certain voter groupings, into wide circulation.

Likely an Axelrod idea - think the Obama 'hope' poster - which worked very well in the states. The Tories did it in 2010 election with the DC posters and UKIP at the EU election with their posters - left media exploded and they got a ton of free media from their ad buy. 




 Too damaged (and damageable still) by association with her husband, too last 10 years to be useful in an election. Essentially a more of the same thing you've seen under Miliband and Brown, but with a more acceptable face candidate.

We need to break away from the past, and another former minister who is easy to paint with the woes of the party won't help. 














 I suspect the reason that Tessa Jowell stood down might be is that she intends to run for the Mayoralty. 




 The electoral landscape shifted against the party in an extremely difficult to surmount way - we would now need 13% swing to get a majority, the Tories only need 6%. 

The electoral system was tilted against the Tories through the last couple of decades because Labour and LibDem supporters in marginals were prepared to vote tactically to keep the Tories out, and many LibDem seats were Lib/Con marginals with the Tories in second place. All of that is over.

We lost votes to the Tories in former Liberal seats, to the Greens everywhere, and notably the SNP in Scotland. Liberal votes went Conservative en masse, and the remainder to the Greens. UKIP hurt us rather than the Tories, because we lost votes to them and their vote turned out to be softer than expected allowing the Tories to win. The Labour vote is being squeezed at the top, bottom, and middle.

In Conservative seats we needed to win there was a swing *to* the Tories, and in seats we already held there was a swing *to Labour* - we got piles of votes where we didn't need them and lost votes where we did. 




 Apparently the 'letter' is missing, so he didn't meet the requirements of the party's constitution. 

My working assumption is that Carswell was being looked to as a future leader in order to divide the work involved but turned out to be a pain in the backside - just as he was in the Conservative party. 




 Zero chance of the Tories putting up a big beast for London Mayor after the last two rounds of local/national elections - 45 Labour seats vs 27 Conservative ones.

Anyone standing on the blue team will essentially be a sacrificial lamb. 




 He's very close to Tessa Jowell, she stood down from Parliament with the Mayoralty in mind, so I very much doubt he would cut across one of his political mentor's plans. 









 Hello fellow Streathamite. 

More to come on this I suspect. Seems a very left field decision for someone who was selected for leadership potential. 




 Those rumours have been around since he stood - mainly fueled by certain streatham lib dems during the 2010 election. Mostly seem to be driven by the absent girlfriend. 







































 I like EJ because he provides experience and an informal style that's absent in the Sky team, I think DC was shaping up to be a great foil for Brundle before the Sky move.

I watch Sky for the 'grown up' Brundle commentary and Kravitz's notebook, but it's a bit of a sausage party, Crofty and Lazenby really getting on my nerves, and only Kravitz, Hill, and Herbert actually look comfortable on camera.

I wish they would let Hill provide more insight and stop playing up the Herbert/Hill comedy duo. 




 Isn't this the reason that Mclaren, Williams, and Mercedes (and some others) have fins on their sidepods? 




 He had a very hard race, he told the sky commentators that the water system wasn't functioning on top of all of the other problems so he would have been extremely dehydrated at the end of the race. 




 Basically every time he hit the throttle, no matter how much, the back snapped out. 




 Of course they're going to say positive things, that's how the world works. Had the been more realistic people would just piss on them. They have made positive gains, they just haven't hit the points yet, but it'll come. 




 People in this sub seem to expect miracles from McLaren, and I don't know why! It takes about 3 years to develop an F1 engine, Honda have had one year and 5 test races.

In terms of on track performance they've gone from 5 seconds of the lead to around 1.6 seconds since the start of the season - which is a huge leap! So they've made a lot of progress, but still have a long way to go. 

I really don't know why everyone is so disappointed. 




 Most of the aero effort seems to be going into the front and rear wings! 





























 I agree. As I said, because the fuel sensors are relatively new and so is the analysis of their data, I suspect that the FIA are seeing information that can't be easily explained and this has lead to some suspicions and the improvement in the rules governing the fuel system. 




 The scrutineers had the opportunity to go over all of the cars thoroughly (because of the test) and found nothing of concern. Since there is no name attached to the complaint, at least publicly, I suspect that it's just concern over unexplained data rather than the teams doing something to get around the rules.  




 Yes, after Alonso's emails had ended up in Bernie's inbox, from where they made their way to the FIA. This is what prompted the second formal investigation and the very pointed request for the driver's information.

On the 2nd of November Alonso announced he was departing McLaren, just 5 days later Renault are charged with possessing McLaren's confidential information, a charge on which they were found guilty.

Who ran Renault? Briatore. Who's Alonso's manager? Briatore. 

You do the math.

By September of the following year Briatore and Alonso were fixing races. 




 Absolutely, it was all a made up conspiracy to deny Alonso his third WDC. Nothing to do with Alonso's behavior and *regal* expectations.

/sarcasm 




 Awful news 




 I see Alonso derangement syndrome is alive and well.

You believe whatever you want to. I'll believe actual facts and the legal records of the hearings that were published by the World Motorsport Council.

Yes the FIA employed and independent scrutineer [at Alonso's request], because Alonso tried to blackmail his way to a WDC got the team fined which put jobs at risk back home, and then expected the engineering staff to treat him normally afterwards. 




 Emails which Alonso then sent to Bernie, and Bernie sent to the FIA. This is a matter of record in a hearing at the World Motorsport council - these are facts and not in any form of dispute.

Also, your attempt to correlate the dispute in qualification and turn it into a blackmail situation has no basis in reality, and has no proof backing it whatsoever.

Again this is a matter of legal record in the World Motorsport Council and is not in dispute. The row occurred in Ron Dennis's motorhome at the race, and happened because Alonso held up Hamilton.  




 No, I mean to say that his holding Hamilton up on track thereby ruining his quali, and then when confronted over it, his threat to Dennis to ruin the team's season and McLaren's reputation unless his demands were accommodated show that he's a bad guy - or a least he was at the time.

Strange also that Renault somehow came into possession of detailed technical specs of McLaren's 2006 and 2007 cars later in the season. I wonder how that happened. 




 You're thinking of the first case which was settled on 26 July 2007 and resulted in no penalty for McLaren (Mosley was unsuccessful).

I'm referring to the second case was heard on 13 September 2007 and was entirely built on the Alonso/De La Rosa/Coughlan emails.

Somehow Alonso's emails had been sent to Bernie, and somehow or other Renault had also obtained extensive technical information on the 2007 McLaren car. I wonder how that happened. 




 Not the case at all. 

There was no proof that the information had been used until Alonso forced Ron's hand. The damning evidence were the emails between De La Rosa and Alonso as these proved the information was beneficial to the team. 




 No. Ron Dennis was doing that in the early 80s, most famously with Prost and Senna - Many years before Merc were even a modern F1 team. Its one of the most famous things about the team.

In fact, given the McLaren/Mercedes history together, there is a very decent argument that Mercedes modelled their team operation on McLaren and this was the nature of the dispute between Brawn and Lauda/Wolff and Lowe. Brawn being a famous team orders man. 




 Alonso wasn't whistleblowing. 

The emails Alonso was threatening to turn over were those exchanged between himself Coughlan and Pedro De La Rosa actually using the Ferrari information between themselves. What he wanted in return for not revealing them was number one status. Dennis refused to be blackmailed and turned the team into the FIA himself. 

Until that point McLaren's story had been that they received the information, but no one actually used it (at least there was no proof that was the case). Since Alonso and De La Rosa had actually used it, and Alonso could prove it from his own email account, that's what blew the case open again. 

The assertions that Dennis treated Hamilton better than Alonso are basically nonsense - Dennis has a very long history of letting his drivers race fairly whereas Alonso was expecting number one status - his treatment after the row with Ron over Spygate was completely understandable as he had basically pissed all over the team and no one at any level of the organisation could tolerate that.

Lets not forget here that Hamilton turned in the best rookie season the sport has ever seen, frequently beating an experienced double world champion with 6 more seasons of F1 experience. Without the team's tyre mistake at the Chinese Grand Prix, he would have won the WDC in his rookie season. 




 No problem. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/35hwqn/alonso_brake_failure_caused_by_visor_tear_off/ 




 Didn't help himself? 

He couldn't cope with being challenged by a rookie so tried to blackmail Ron Dennis, which led to McLaren being disqualified and fined $100 million. 

The only reason he wasn't at least disqualified from that years championship or worse (it was he and De La Rose sharing the data) was that he gave evidence against McLaren for immunity. 




 What's funny, when you've been watching the sport for several decades, is reading these comments and remembering that's what was being said about the likes of Prost, Senna, Schumacher and Mansell during their careers. 




 Like Alonso and Piquet, Prost was his own worst enemy. 




 Its one of those 'letter vs the spirit of the rules' situations (if it's actually happening at all). From what I can gather of the camera pods, the were only a couple of millimetres larger than the rules required.

But that's F1, complain about good ideas first and then duplicate them later. 




 I don't have any emotional investment in Nasr, but I have been impressed by his and Sainz potential. I also think, thanks to Maldonado and a lot of people who don't really understand how the sport works, the label 'pay driver' is being thrown around in a very ignorant fashion at the moment. 

Nasr got sponsorship because he's Brazilian *and* good, not because he happened to be the only Brazilian in F1.

As I've pointed out elsewhere, it was Fittipaldi that bought Philip Morris to McLaren, and Alonso who bought in Santander. 




 Good point, I failed to filter out Keke, so Nico has 16 and Keke has 3. 




 At the junior stage of his career it makes his results better than Rosberg's at the same stage, which is what I said. 




 No, but I'm not surprised it wasn't mentioned, without a name of the complainant attached such things haven't been mentioned in the past. 

I don't know if one or more teams has complained, or something the stewards have seen in an engine has made them suspicious - I would suspect the latter. They timed the announcement well, since everyone is hanging around in Spain for the test it gave them the opportunity to have a really thorough look at the cars. 




 Fittipaldi bought his personal sponsors Philip Morris to McLaren, Alonso bought his personal sponsors Santander to McLaren and Ferrari, both left the sponsors behind when they left. 

*Everyone* is a pay driver at some stage. Gaining sponsors is a competitive advantage in getting an F1 seat, when moving teams, and in paying for a junior career. Even for drivers in a junior programme.

If the debate is that results matter, Nasr has the results. 









 It looks radical for sure, but the fundamental that led to this design is still dealt with in the modern era with less obvious imagination, but imagination non-the-less.

It's not the only six wheeled F1 car, but it is the only one to race - there's the [March 2-4-0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2-4-0), [Ferrari 312T6](http://s183.photobucket.com/user/Starcowboy/media/Enzo/312t2-6a.jpg.html), and even a Williams. Ferrari even tried an eight wheeled version of the [312T6](http://pixgood.com/ferrari-312t6.html)

Funnily enough the reasoning behind the 6 wheels was dealing with dirty air better to reduce drag, these days we do that through the complicated front wings. 




 Nasr. He has two junior championships a 2nd and two 3rds under his belt - those are better junior results than Rosberg (2 championships and one 2nd), and only one junior championship adrift of Schumacher (3 championships, one 2nd, one 3rd) at the same stage of his career. Yet he's branded a pay driver. 




 In which case it doesn't make sense that Fangio still holds so many records, compared to Jackie Stewart who entered 48 more races than he did.

Equally Hamilton holds more records than Senna, even though as of last week, he has entered 152 grand prix compared to Senna's 162. In this case Hamilton and Senna can be directly compared and Hamilton wins that particular contest.

Fangio competed in 52 races over and eight year career winning 46.15% of all the races he entered - no modern era driver can hope to come close to that, so the bias you refer to has a reverse. The result is that many of the records Fangio holds like oldest driver to enter, highest win percentage, cannot be broken in the modern era. Likewise there are some modern records, that Fangio couldn't get near - total laps led, number of consecutive entries.

Finally, if 'chances' mattered then Barrichello, having entered 326 races should hold more records than anyone else, but he only has 19, Alonso should also hold many more records than Hamilton having entered 240 races.

What's really interesting though is that if you knock out the percentage stats, and records that couldn't be broken in the modern era Hamilton is the second best driver ever behind Vettel, because Schumacher holds a lot of records simply through the longevity of his career - which is also a record. 




 I suspect a lot of that is down to Briatore's influence on the young Alonso. 




 In terms of the total number of F1 driver records held, the only people ahead of Hamilton (52) are Schumacher (97) and Vettel (72). 

He's already eclipsed Clark (36), Senna (37), Lauda (16), Prost (42), Mansell (29), Stewart (14), Fangio (37), Ascari (20), Hill (5), Hkkinen (17), Alonso (46), N. Rosberg (16) and many more. 

He's also the only active driver increasing his count of records at the moment - adding 4 in 2014, Vettel was down 5 in the same period.

Statistically at least Hamilton is the third best driver in F1 history. 




 Yep, they were conservative and didn't want to risk the position. I understand the reasons and from a team point of view they make sense, from a racing point of view they don't.  




 Spotting the parking manoeuvre (the drivers can't see the nose), and watching for un-noticed problems. 




 For much of the 94' pre-season and virtually the whole of the season teams were concerned about safety because active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control had all been banned and no attempt had been made to curtail speed. 

*This is fact*, its not disputed by anyone with direct knowledge of the season, and in all of the incidents I highlighted speed and load on vehicle components were the defining factor of the crashes.

All of the on track incidents occurred because of critical component failure under load or simple loss of control i.e. the cars had been designed for electronic stabilisation systems that were no longer available. Williams remain unable to directly attribute Senna's accident to component failure (although all of that remains murky), and there remains a credible argument that, under pressure on a flat out corner with a bumpy track, he lost a difficult car that he was not yet comfortable with.

Weather was not a factor in the crashes of Senna, Ratzenberger, Barichello, Wendlinger, or Montermini - all of which were avoidable and severe. 




 All Lewis needed to do was put him under pressure, Rosberg has a history of making costly errors in that situation. One spin would have done the trick. 





























 They race under a German licence as a German company, the board who make the decisions are German. Ergo the contract would need to be compatible with German law if one or both of the parties chose to prosecute it there.  




 In my experience (which is around 5 years of working on improving business processes for contracts inside law firms) the client end of a sports deal involves about 10 lawyers of various ranks plus associates, support staff, and an outside team of accountants. 

There will be a number of different components to the contract and each will require singular expertise their field i.e. you'll have someone on personal terms, someone on image rights, someone on sporting terms etc - a large contract such as this may even involve multiple law firms working together. 

The majority of the term negotiations between the parties are conducted by each side's lawyers and accountants within the direction set by their clients. You only involve the principles when there is approval required, a disputed issue, or to finalise a component. 




 We came close to doing that in 1994 - banned all of the traction and driver aids that 'purist' fans said were ruining the racing, had little in the way of meaningful surface aero, and teams could run as close to the ground as they liked.

Ultimately, the cars were simply too quick and powerful to be controllable in general, and even modestly safe when something went wrong. None of the circuits were ready for such high speed accidents. Senna's death disguises a [series[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSI27en56tg) [of[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yUxMLIbtIk) [terrifying[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xumw9c5j-3A) [accidents[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd-nSWjdpHI) and on track [incidents[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxMtYyNZ6Q) during 1994 that are rarely talked of anymore. The pit lane speed limits and downforce reduction measures we see today all came from that season's racing - 1994 defines modern F1.

"Its going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesnt happen." - Ayrton Senna, during the 94' pre-season.


In the end the 94' season left two drivers dead, another in a coma, one seriously injured marshall, five injured spectators, and a seriously injured mechanic.

No one wants the spending war ground effect floors would bring, and no one wants 1994 to happen again. 

Be very careful what you wish for in this regard.
 




 Theoretically, sure. But everyone would be in the same boat, wearing at broadly the same rate, the pace of which is dictated by the lead car. 

So ultimately you'd end up in same situation whilst handing an unfair penalty to anyone with a puncture or who had to stop for other reasons. 




 Thing is it doesn't really work like that. You always lose time pitting, its an automatic disadvantage, so extant other circumstances that would cause you to pit because you had to, all teams would run the race on one set of tyres. 




 Yes. At this point of development tyres can do pretty much anything F1 would like them to. So in that era they were spec'd to be quick and last the race by design, but it was quite dull. 




 I used the word team to imply that more than one person is involved (as is blatantly obvious). 

Yes, his staff will be dealing with non-vital terms and contract minutiae - he won't be negotiating every single line himself. 




 We've had those. They make for incredibly dull processional racing and further penalise the drivers for racing incidents, punctures, and wing adjustments that require them to pit. 

The problem is it's very hard to overtake on the old European circuits, as we've just seen, so increasing the pit stops adds variables and makes for better racing.  




 Any contract will have to apply in Germany, where Mercedes is based, and in Monaco, where Hamilton is based. To achieve that you'll need lawyers for both parties at both ends, assistants to handle messaging, arrange meetings, check amendments, and even negotiate non-important terms (i.e. things that you wouldn't trouble Lewis about) and a variety of other minutiae.  

So while Lewis doesn't have management and is negotiating the important parts of the deal directly, he will have lawyers, financial advisors, and personal assistants that help him structure the whole thing - hence the perfectly acceptable use of the word 'team' in my comment. 




 Team, as in team of lawyers and personal staff. 




 I read that at the time, but Fernando didn't answer the posed question directly and the report from Shanghai was unsourced. Having it from Allison confirms the speculation was true - and many people on here have disputed these earlier reports.  









 The *idea* that this was the case is old news, but I don't think that we have had confirmation from Alonso or Allison that it was actually what happened, hence "Allison admits" in the headline. 





























 Most of the list is looking back at things the sport has done before which is always bad news. 

Personally I think the formula is great, the speed always comes back as the teams develop the cars, I'd just like to see closer racing. 




 I'm from Northampton, although I live in London, and have been to about 15 BGP. Totally worth going, even if its your first and only time. General admission tickets have very decent views depending on how early you make it to a spot (go *very* early, take a friend, plan your spot in advance). 

Don't take the train - rent a car - place is a buggering nightmare to get to by rail.  









 Now there are [photographs](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CGxHDWwXEAA3Tos.jpg:large) 



















 From a recent [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2015/05/31/f1-revenue-accelerates-past-fifas-to-16-2-billion/) article:

Research by the Express newspaper last year revealed that Mr Ecclestone has signed deals worth an estimated $23.4 billion in the 30 years since he took over the helm of F1. It is understood to be more than any other individual in the history of professional sport has raised.

Pretty impressive record

Mr Ecclestone is directly in charge of bringing in new business across all of F1s major revenue streams. The sport has no chief marketing officer, no press officer and not even a deputy chief executive or successor for its 84 year-old boss. He says he has no intention of retiring and whilst he is delivering these kind of results it is little surprise that CVC too doesn't want him to give up the wheel.

You won't replace Bernie with one person. There simply isn't anyone who could do what Bernie does at the level he does it, and across the different disciplines involved. The board would restructure FOM into a more modern business with separate people in charge of the major revenue streams. 




 You can pay Now TV (which are a Sky brand) 6.99 for a one day pass or 9.99 for a week pass and have the high quality stream in the UK. It's pretty good and honestly its both cheaper and better than having the full Sky package.

The problem is the way rights are negotiated both historically and currently with national level broadcasters by region on ten year contracts - this type of licensing runs across many sports and is in general 'the way things are done' in the industry.

If you wanted a centralized streaming solution then FOM would have to come to an agreement with *every* regional broadcaster over a licensing fee on the pictures (because they've already licenced them from FOM), and another separate agreement over the commentary (the IP for which is their property of the broadcaster), and a third over how and when the revenue is distributed. 

You could negotiate for FOM to hold the streaming rights exclusively, but FOM then wouldn't fetch a good price on the rights, and it would lower the quality of the TV shows because, as a business, the broadcaster will have to start to question the value of shipping a team of 30+ people around the world to every race in order to produce a show that it realises little or no cash flow from.

Achieving a global streaming deal would be a hugely complex effort and take years of negotiations - not only that but a centralised solution isn't necessarily in the financial interests of FOM or the regional broadcasters both of whom are buying the rights to a product they can repackage and sell at a profit. It may, however, save everyone the costs of producing and marketing their own apps and streaming and that might be attractive in the long run.

The new F1 app broadcasts commentary in multiple languages so I do believe this is the direction they are moving in, but you'll probably have to wait until the each regional contract is renewed for it to happen globally.

$1 a race is completely unrealistic pricing wise though, it wouldn't even cover the production costs of filming the races let alone provide enough revenue for everyone to make money - remember the TV rights make up about $6 - 700 million of the team's prize money - hurting the value of the TV rights directly hurts the teams. 




 No, but the engines can be reused unless they had to be changed because of a failure. You could take a change and then re-use an engine for a low power circuit. 




 There was a proposal to allow an extra engine for friday practice only, but it didn't go through. 




 10 place grid penalty per new engine. 




 In 2014 $398 million on $1.6 billion in revenue. 














 It won't - the FIA bidding document is seeking a sole supplier only. 




 I'm very disappointed in Max's reaction to the crash - he keeps doubling down on the braking claim. He declared on his instagram feed after the race that he believes he was brake tested and that it cost him points he 'deserved'. 

That claim provoked a response from Lotus proving he was wrong and then a response from Grosjean, rightly asking what he would gain from doing it - the answer to which is nothing at all! Especially at Monaco where tiny mistakes plant you in the wall.

Two days after the instagram post he said in an article on his own website.

"After an unlucky pit stop, I was charging through the field, before I got brake tested and had a hard crash into turn 1."

The only reason that this is still an issue is that Max keeps repeating the lunatic claim that he was brake tested - and the fact that no one has talked him down suggests that he's surrounded by 'yes people' and that doesn't bode well for his future.

Hopefully criticism from F1's most experienced driver will hurt in a good way and bring him down to earth. 




 From a sports perspective you have to brush this sort of thing off and focus on the next race. That's really the biggest improvement Hamilton has been able to make in his racing. 














 To translate some of the figures the article puts Jordan Ford's 2003 budget at around $79 million, in 2015 dollars thats $101 million, which is about the annual budget estimation for the mid-pack teams today. Minardi was pegged at $46 million ($60 million in 2015 money) and again that's about the budget of a 2015 back of the grid team.

Ferrari were spending $418 million in 2003 (equivalent of $617 million in 2015 or double Mercedes current budget), and they're actually spending around $250 million now.

Overall that suggests that costs have slowed or remained the same, accounting for inflation, rather than climbing as steeply as everyone seems to imagine. In other words the cost reduction efforts have been very successful.

FYI Read that article - it could have been written today. 




 Adelaide 1986 - last race of the season and an absolute [classic](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8vjjg_f1-adelaide-1986-rosberg-and-mansel_auto). 

Keke Rosberg almost won what was his last ever F1 race but retired with a delaminating left rear, Mansell just had to keep 3rd to win the WDC having been elevated from 4th by Rosberg's retirement but lost his left rear 2 laps later in spectacular fashion, leaving the WDC to Piquet (the defending champion), or Prost. A precautionary tyre change from Williams left Piquet too far behind and he lost to Prost by 4 seconds having closed 11 seconds of a 15 second gap in the closing stages.

Amazing race, gutted for Mansell. 




 Villeneuve the driver was terrific, Villeneuve bloviating, bitter, and endlessly negative commentator not so much.

He's one of 'those drivers' now. It's a pity because his post F1 career has been pretty good and he's one of the very few with a shot at the motorsport triple crown. 




 I remember Raikkonen's rear wing flying off in a chicane - Kimi has the worst luck! 




 Given that 2010 caused Ferrari to fire Aldo Costa who went on to be the Engineering Director responsible for the W05 and W06 it was definitely worse! 




 Mansell's tyre exploding and costing him his second WDC. 

Equally bad was Mansell's car stalling on the last lap of Canada 91'

Absolutely gutting. 




 If there had been double points in the last round of every season Raikkonen would have beaten Schumacher in 03', Hamilton would have lost to Massa in 08', and Alonso would have beaten Vettel in 12'.

Those, incidentally, are the only WDC's that double points would have altered between 2000 and 2013. 









 Its got little to do with the regs and everything to do with the driver position in the car - the height of the driver and their seating position affects the weight distribution significantly. /u/Blanchimont has a good summary of what can be [done](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/38dypt/merhi_bemoans_weight_difference_to_f1_teammate/crusb6l).

There are some things that the regs can balance driver weight wise, but its very hard to regulate for driver height not least because you have to alter the car to get the seating position right. Its questionable these days if Webber or Coulthard would make it as far as they did given they're both about the same height as Hulkenberg. 




 He, from his perspective, didn't have any worthwhile choice. In the end it was drive for Toyota or leave. 




 Its a negotiation ploy. No matter how badly your career is going you don't leave F1 unless you have no other choice. 




 Force India have said that they'd like to keep their current line-up. 




 The WDC would remain points decided, just with bonus points awarded, and that would bring it into line with other major competitions like the Six Nations. F1's present system is countback - which also rewards race winners above non-winners but is only used when there is a points tie.

A large chunk of the money teams get is based on their WDC points, the more points you get the more money you get - this would provide a mechanism to achieve that without renegotiating the concorde agreement which will remain in place until 2020.

In any case my point was that one group of people say that x is a problem, those in charge attempt to find a solution that fits within the frameworks in place that solves the problems put forward - at which point the teams fail to agree, put a broken version forward and everyone goes mad. 



















 It didn't so much as get neutered as Red Bull broke it up. 




 My point really is that people spend so much time and energy on Bernie and being cynical and/or foolish about his motives that they fail to notice the actual politics of the sport and who really makes the decisions. The failure of the teams to agree on anything is the only real problem the sport has ever had - that was as true in the 1950s as it is today - and the teams should receive a much more critical press than they actually get.

Double points last year was a case in point. Bernie's proposal was for a bonus points system for race wins delivered through medals and double points through the last three races of the season.

The issues that proposal was trying to solve were three fold:-

- That the WDC winner should also have won the most races;

- That the mid-grid teams are struggling financially and more points means more money delivered from FOM; and

- That all but the top three ceasing development late in the season made the racing dull and more points available would incentivise continued development while spicing up the drivers championship.

These are all things widely supported by both fans and the teams, and all big issues.

The Strategy group and the F1 commission (i.e. the teams) could only agree on double points for the last race so thats the broken plan that went ahead - everyone went crazy at Bernie for a decision that wasn't his - and problems were only created not solved.  




 Whomever holds the presidency of the FIA and the Chairmanship of FOM will always be labelled 'the biggest problem the sport has' because it's very easy to blame them for any problem you choose to. 




 People act like Bernie and the FIA are the same thing, and this isn't the case at all. Secondly unanimous agreement is required. 




 They never have been able to agree throughout the history of the sport - thats why Bernie was so successful. This is just another episode in the motorsport equivalent of Eastenders.

 









 That is true, and I do take your point. As ever though the teams find a way around whatever [regs are in place](http://adamcooperf1.com/2015/05/24/fia-clarifies-process-for-power-unit-reliability-upgrades/). 














 You can, but this has been heavily abused by the teams, and as a result the FIA has come down hard on this in 2015. 









 Did Ferrari take a new engine for Monaco? I didn't catch that, they're on three this year so far? 









 I think that while RBR were winning everything in sight and were, to an extent, the big financial force in F1 they successfully sought to split FOTA and negotiate directly with FOM - as a result of their political machinations other teams followed suit and the 2013 Concorde agreement was formed. 

A key part of their effort was the fallout from the various trials that Ecclestone went through over the sale of stakes in the commercial rights - I think there were three attempted takeovers a board level - mostly centring on the 15% stake owned by the Lehman estate rather than CVC's controlling interest. My bet is that Mateschitz wanted to acquire that along with another 20% stake which would give him the chairmanship of FOM's board and the controlling interest. Bernie successfully fought off those efforts and CVC retain control at the moment - but I don't think this is where CVC wanted to end up and I don't think they quite know what to do - there is considerable pressure from the teams for them to sell.

At the same time RBR lost a key political battle over the 2014 rules and we're seeing the fallout from that on the track. It appears to me that Mercedes were able to form an alliance with Renault fighting a successful rearguard action to set the direction of the Formula in the interests of the manufacturers. I'd be curious to learn if Honda were involved in the background of all of this. 



















 Its rather like RonSpeak. If you listen and think very carefully about what's being said you'll understand the context and tone of his remarks - problem is most people don't listen or think, they just dismiss. 




 I think its all very well to criticise Bernie - he takes a lot of flak for decisions made by the teams and direction from CVC - but people fail to consider the alternatives.

In many respects Bernie is F1 - he's the chief deal maker - he has enough clout to bring important people to the table and keep them there and he's a very tough negotiator for the sport. 

Were Bernie to go there isn't anyone in the background that is both a sharp political operator and has the clout to drag people along. 




 It seems that neither Torro Rosso or Lotus are interested in selling to Renault (they would be the ideal targets in terms of infrastructure with Sauber as the third option) but Manor would make a lot more sense than entering a new team entirely. 

Lotus and Sauber come with a chunk of debt because Genii and Kaltenborn would want their investments returned at a profit - this makes them less than ideal takeover targets - but makes them interesting investment opportunities.

I've been wondering for a while if Mercedes might leverage its engine deal with Lotus to use them as 'B' team seats for its nascent young driver programme (the fly in that idea being a potential takeover of Lotus by Renault). For all the talk about McLaren and Ferrari 'B' outfits, people seem to have missed Mercedes obvious need for one of their own. They appear to be flirting with Verstappen again, Wehrlein is in the background, as is Ocon, and they can't do anything with them without F1 seats to put them in - as their 2014 attempt to get Verstappen demonstrated.

The timing of the FIA opening up entries seemed interesting. I thought that Renault might seek to enter an entirely new team if they couldn't find an existing team to buy, but going for Manor makes a lot more commercial sense. For all their lack of infrastructure they have an entry, basic facilities and staff, all of which is better than nothing.

If Mercedes invest in Lotus (both of their drivers appear to be out of contract this year), McLaren Honda bring in ART GP, and Renault take over Manor it will make for a very interesting couple of years ahead - this will put RBR under extreme pressure.

I've suspected that the background to the RBR 'exit' talk is their maneuvering for control of the sporting regulations against Mercedes and Renault - both of whom wanted the v6 formula. It appears to me that RBR lost a political fight they felt certain they would win over the 2014 regulations and unable to get the regs they wanted, a works deal with another supplier, or sell the team, they find themselves trapped politically and commercially. 









 Considering the Tory Majority is built on less than 20,000 votes it would be unwise to completely ignore polling. 7 of those constituencies went blue by, in total, less than 900 votes collectively.

People forget that the polls are +/-5 in margin of error, and that is not so far from the actual result in the recent election. Talking to friends who are normally reliable Labour voters a number switched to the Greens in the polling booth because they had so little confidence in the Labour leadership. 




 He's one of those good/reliable drivers who's been unlucky that there was always someone absolutely stellar ahead of him. 




 They broadcast the BBC when they're televising the race live, and Sky the rest of the time so it was good. The stream seems to vary by country though. 









 If you subscribe to the F1 app it streams commentary to your device - used this to listen to Monaco whist taking the kids to Comic Con. Worked very well indeed!  




 I've been wondering for a while if Mercedes might leverage its engine deal with Lotus to use them as 'B' team seats for its nascent young driver programme. They appear to be flirting with Verstappen again, Wehrlein is in the background, as is Ocon, and they can't do anything with them without F1 seats to put them in.

Renault seem interested in buying Lotus, but the Mercedes deal might prevent that from happening immediately, at all, or mean they take a stake and convert to a works outfit for 2017 or beyond once the Mercedes deal is over. 

If Lotus aren't willing to sell, and nor are Torro Rosso, then the timing of the FIA opening up entries seems interesting. Perhaps Renault might seek to enter an entirely new team - could this be the project Berger is working on?

Grosjean is out of contract at the end of the season, and Maldonado must be close to the end of his having signed in 2013 for one year and then extended for 2015. 









 Ultimately the track position data was wrong about where Hamilton was on the circuit which made the result of any calculation performed with that data wrong - or have an unacceptably large margin of error depending on your view.

Either way its perfectly acceptable to describe the data as wrong. 

You also can't blame a group of people used to trusting a system which has churned out accurate information numerous times for not catching the error when they had to make a last second call under extreme pressure.

Everybody's an armchair quarterback on this - and no one has a right to be.  




 GPS doesn't work at Monaco because of the terrain. So their computer system was relying on the timing beams for track position data, that introduced a large margin of error into what would normally be an accurate calculation, so their data was indeed wrong. 









 Force India appear to have a deal with Mercedes and want to keep their current line up, Sauber with Ferrari, and Manor/Marussia are basically getting people to drive for free - once they have a 2015 spec car they might be useful to someone, but most likely Ferrari. 




 I don't think the author is writing in his first language. 




 And he's provably wrong - he wasn't brake tested. He tried a junior move on a circuit where you can't get away with that kind of thing. 




 Verstappen declared on his instgram feed that he beleives he was [brake tested](https://instagram.com/p/3KKmnkSqjv/) and that cost him points he 'deserved'. That claim provoked a response from [Lotus](https://twitter.com/AlanPermane/status/603518447595737089) and then the response contained in the article linked to above from Grosjean (rightly asking what he would gain from doing it - the answer to which is nothing at all! *Especially* at Monaco where tiny mistakes plant you in the wall).

In the same [article](http://verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht id=2134 lang=en) quoted by you on Verstappen's **own** website, published two days after the instagram feed claim, Verstappen includes the line:
*"After an unlucky pit stop, I was charging through the field, before I got brake tested and had a hard crash into turn 1."*

The only reason that this is still an issue is that Max keeps repeating the lunatic claim that he was brake tested - he doesn't accept that he made an error - which is very concerning. 
























 Its far from unique in racing series the world over. It's not even unique in F1, Super Aguri were effectively Honda's B team and financed almost entirely by Honda in much the same way as TR until the recession hit. In fact the first three decades of the sport were built on a model where drivers and teams bought their cars from works outfits.

But the reality on the ground is RBR weren't allowed to have TR function as a B team in the way they wanted. They share information, but not designs, mapping, development or day-to-day engineering staff etcetera. They kept the team because the racing seats were worth more to them than the team itself.

RedBull might be very successful (est. value $7.2 billion), but the largest company in F1 are Mercedes-Benz at $22.5 billion, Fiat Chrysler (Ferrari) are worth $20.69 billion. 

To put RedBull's value in perspective Hyundai are actually worth more at $8 billion. 




 The rationale for GP2 was having a feeder series that travelled with F1, provided a support show, got the drivers used to being part of the 'circus', and allowed the teams to meet and use them as test or Friday practice drivers at no extra expense.

It solved a lot of problems, and has hugely increased the quality of the drivers, but it's not the same as driving an F1 car. 









 http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37tpl7/kehm_explains_schumacher_media_strategy/ 




 Personally I've never had a problem with customer cars - it worked just fine in the 60s and 70s, provided an entry point for a lot of great drivers, and made for interesting racing at the back of the grid. 




 I suspect the latter. But that's about as much context as you'll get from twitter. 




 The 'B' teams, by regulation, are independent - look at TR. 




 As I've said elsewhere don't discount Mercedes, they're aggressively pursuing a young driver programme and need B team seats to put them in. 
























 In fact it's a marketing platform for supercar and sports car manufacturers, everyone else makes up the numbers.  




 Participation should be justifiable based on the state of the sport in and of itself

But that has never ever been the case. F1 is a marketing platform and it has never been anything else at any point in its history.

 




 Why does it need to be fixed?

Why does F1 need small teams that are unable to compete on track or be successful enough in the sport to gain investors and stay afloat?

We need teams like HAAS that are prepared to take a patient approach to entry and have a strong underlying business that can benefit from the team's participation whilst supporting the team financially.

All of the successful outfits in the sport have a strong underlying business, all of the teams struggling to stay in don't. There is a reason for that.

137 constructors have participated in the sport since 1950, the average team competes in 20 races for 3 seasons with 5 drivers, wins 0 races, and scores 0 points. 




 2004ish - they were sharing data with Toyota (who were banned from the WRC for a similar cheating scandal). 



















 http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37miit/beautiful_1990_williamsrenault_f1_car_offered_at/ 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37onbu/door_open_for_indian_gp_return_as_ecclestone/ 




 Yes. They're also the only team who have previously been involved in a wind tunnel data-sharing scandal. 




 Interesting that so much of the recent FIA clampdowns seems to have Ferrari at the centre of them. Wonder if someone is complaining or if someone suspects there is more to their recent return to form. 




 I don't disagree. Though Kvyat seems to have found his form and might be up to the challenge - he put in a great drive last weekend at one of the most difficult circuits. 

RBR only hung on to Verstappen in 2014 by promoting him to TR. Mercedes are aggressively pursuing him again, it would seem, so this pushing him into the top might be how they keep him in the RBR family. 














 Ted K was saying, in several of his notebook pieces at Monaco, that Berger has suddenly shown up at recent races talking to a lot of people and hinting that he's 'up to something', I think it also came up in Brundle's grid walk. 

Berger's a very popular figure and he'd be a great choice to lead a new team. I suspect this would lend credence to the idea of a McLaren Honda ART GP team moving into F1 as his history is with McLaren. 




 I did wonder when I posted, decided to play it safe! 




 Very little of what Bernie has done over the years justifies the idea that he's only in this for the money - he's the guy that does the big deals with serious people.

Whilst I don't disagree that it's time for a change, I don't think there is anyone with Bernie's clout or ability in a position to lead the sport, and anyone that has enough political talent to get in won't have the clout or experience to make real change happen. 




 I'd say there was some flexibility in that policy. Thanks for the interesting info, I thought he was much closer to the points he needed. In any case my overall point is that they're trying to build a young driver programme and need mid/back of the grid seats to put them in. 




 Basically. I believe you can stay within the rules and still buyout the whole car. Stoddart bought the 2002 Arrows package in the hope that it was better than what he had at the time, when that didn't turn out to be the case he sold it to SuperAguri who raced it in 2006. 




 If only... 




 I think they could manage it - theoretically you could sell the IP on an old Merc chassis to another company for change and start there - it's been done before. Wouldn't be easy but you wouldn't need to be competitive in the early phases. 




 The fifth engine business would allow the extra engine for Friday practice only, but the deal they were seeking on it's wider use would have seen the engine supplier rules relaxed going forward. 

(obv. this is all gossip and supposition) 

The rules relaxation in return for 'something' deal has come up a number of times in separate fights and was on the table during the token fight at the end of last season. Mercedes seem very keen on it, and I can't see who they would have as a customer that they don't have already, so perhaps they're thinking of the future.

Merc paid for Force India's testing so Pascal Wehrlein would be in a position to meet the new superlicence regulations, they were trying to snag [Verstappen](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2014/09/mercedes-pushes-young-driver-programme-pascal-wehrlein-new-f1-reserve-driver/) and Ocon in 2014, and I can't see why they would do that without having seats to put them in (RBR kept VER by bumping him up to TR). 

I've been wondering for a while if they might do a deal with Lotus (Grosjean is out of contract this year, Crashtor is obviously Crashtor) and move their young drivers there on the back of reduced price engines. That would be difficult if Renault are keen for a buyout (unless they take a stake instead and move slowly towards a works team). 

Anyway - all of this together makes be think moves are afoot for a Mercedes B-team. 




 See my comment [above](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37mldq/breaking_news_fia_opens_new_selection_process_to/cro2ei6) - just replied to the same question. 




 Technically. But they appeared to be offering a deal over the fifth engine a few weeks ago that would see that requirement relaxed (Lauda mentioning they were happy to supply the whole grid etc). IMO Mercedes are keen on customer cars, keen to supply more engines, and not too happy with Bernie's leadership... 

Also a Lotus buyout by Renault, [which seems likely](http://www.grandprix247.com/2015/05/28/have-renault-already-bought-lotus/), would leave them room for manuvre in the existing rules, they also compete in DTM with ART GrandPrix. 




 I don't need to imagine, this was what F1 was like until the late 70s. 

Medical cars didn't even appear until the mid-80s. 




 I wouldn't discount Mercedes, they have some talented youngsters struggling for seats and the money to start a team from scratch.

Renault seem to want a works team by 2017 and if they can't buy TR or Lotus perhaps this is a route they might use.

One of these might be the 'Berger' project Kravitz was hinting at over the Monaco weekend - hopefully something else entirely - could make for an interesting 2016!

 Sadly. 



















 The stat is for tracks, not races. 




 Formula One moved around a lot more in Prost's day than the current era - we now have 10 year contracts for staging races - in the 80's it was much more random affair. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, 6 different American tracks, 3 different British tracks, Austria, Switzerland, even Portugal to name a few. There were also plenty of one off and non-championship races at a wide variety of locations.

Its equally true that teams would have as many as 6 drivers in a season, just look at the [teams and drivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Formula_One_season#Drivers_and_constructors) in the 1980 season.

That's one of the reason's it's taken 22 years for this record to come close to being broken. Prost had a 13 year career with 199 race starts, Lewis has had an 8 year career to date with 154 starts. 














 I don't see it - the stewards would have noticed something like this - brake testing is a serious matter. Also what would Grosjean gain from doing it? There would be no guarantee of a finish for him and, as his contract is up this year, he needs the points. 




 Painfully true isn't it. Strongly suspect Jensen has been looking forward to measuring himself against the driver of the decade. Thus far Alonso isn't delivering the fight everyone expected!. 




 He was having front brake/balance issues at the start of the race, I did wonder if there was a remaining issue with the car when he hit the position board. Lewis does seem to have some issues hitting his marks in the Merc and I've thought more than once that it might be a setup issue. 




 Alonso fans too. There are some spectacular reach arounds going on in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37c9g5/vettel_eclipses_alonsos_best_after_six_rounds_as/). 




 Don't underestimate the dodgy behavior that was going on in the 1994 season. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Formula_One_cheating_controversy 




 Data apparently shows Grosjean actually braked later than on the previous lap. In any case the stewards would have been down on the frenchmen like a ton of bricks if there was a shred of evidence. I also can't see what Grosjean would gain from doing it.

Quite surprised that Max repeated the allegation! Midfield handbags at the ready!

The data shows I actually braked five metres later than on the lap before. I was braking as late as I could with my tyres as they were.

 Honda seem to have fixed their drivability problems, next up is power and reliability. Small gains each time out appear to be the order of the day. 




 That's simply cutting the facts to fit your argument. 









 Any NFL or NHL game is geoblocked in the areas around the stadium - they would like you to buy tickets, not watch at home. 




 Greece - as I've identified above simply didn't reform its economy. Spain and Ireland's problems stem from their respective property booms and they both had pretty well managed economies. Italy is just a mess politically and no one had their hands on the controls.

Arguably the Euro played a role in all, it helped in some places but not in others, and none would have survived without Eurozone bailouts. I'm afraid you can't lay all of these problems at the door of the EU and pretend removing the Euro from the equation would have solved their problems. 



















 http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/373zr7/photo_of_the_day/ 









 You lost me in the first two lines of your Greece argument - the real problem wasn't the Euro, the problem was that they had 20 years to reform their economy and labour practices and failed to even start doing it until it was far too late. 

Tax avoidance was a national pastime, their public sector was massively bloated and people routinely held jobs but did little or no work.

Closed professions were also a serious problem which caused massive price inflation compared to the rest of Europe. Truckers, pharmacists and those wishing to join 68 other professions had to buy one of a limited number of [licences](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/world/europe/15greece.html?_r=0) costing 500,000 euro or more. 

The truck licences alone made goods ludicrously expensive to transport and that was a drag on everything from manufacturing to general retail. 




 TBH I'm not hugely enthused by the whole field.

Burnham will always be painted as too close to the Unions, Cooper, also close to the Unions, is inextricably linked to Balls and that will always be used as a mighty weapon against her - both will quickly be painted with the failings of the Blair and Brown cabinets they both bore collective responsibility in. 

I haven't enjoyed Kendall's stridency thus far, and am a *little* more swayed by Creagh. I do think it would be valuable to have a female leader and someone who represents a Northern constituency with irish roots would do very nicely in terms of drawing a contrast against Cameron and Osborne. She can speak to a geographic area in which we have start performing well from experience, and speak with authority on the EU. Reading a little of what she's written in the press it appears she 'gets' Scotland.

I like her position on business, she's good in the Commons and lands punches well, her background means she would be taken seriously on the EU and its is difficult to assail her with the usual 'metropolitan-elite' attacks despite her Oxbridge education. 

 









 I'm assuming from the uninformed nature of your comment that you didn't actually read the article, or the version of it written by every other F1 news site. 




 As Button said after quali: "Coulda, woulda, shoulda". Its very easy to be wise and armchair quarterback after the event. That they considered what might happen if Ferrari pitted is wise, its unlikely that it was the most persuasive factor in their decision in the end.

Drivers don't "complain all the time" drivers tell the team what's happening from their perspective, with the limited amount of information they have, and send messages to the stewards and race control via the only means of communication they have available to them.

With so little time to make a decision it's easy to make a mistake. Brave of Hamilton to maintain composure and say the right things despite what was obviously a devastating loss after a long weekend of very hard work and brilliant driving.

Looking at the threads after the event people are seizing on insignificant things like the team photo and the position bollard and using them to make completely uninformed criticisms. Hamilton put out an amazing quali finding 3 extra tenths over Rosberg twice, then pulled out a 20 second lead over Rosberg during the race at F1's most difficult circuit. Simply amazing stuff. 




 The team have the final say and they have access to information that the driver does not - ergo its the fault of the team, not the driver. 




 More than likely the terrain prevents it working effectively.  




 I don't see how you can claim that it's a widely held view that Hamilton was suddenly and unexpectedly told to pit or that he was at fault. His part in the decision was noted in the race commentary, in his comments after the race, and virtually every article on the topic written since. 

Discussing if it's sensible to pit isn't the same as requesting to pit and many people in this sub are using this as an avenue to criticise Hamilton (who drove an imperious weekend) - especially the Rosbergerttes.

[James Allen's analysis](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2015/05/talking-point-how-will-mercedes-make-it-up-to-hamilton-for-lost-monaco-victory/) (emphasis mine) below. Interesting because it includes the timings (20 secs to make the decision), introduces Nasr's stop as a factor, and explains the parameters of the decision from the team's perspective. 

Also of note is that Toto revealed last night that the [teams don't have GPS at Monaco](http://adamcooperf1.com/2015/05/24/toto-wolff-we-got-the-maths-wrong/) which would have affected their decision making ability.

Hamilton was part of the decision making process, as he confirmed after the race, telling the team that the soft tyres were losing temperature and pressure behind the safety car and *if there was sufficient gap to easily pit and rejoin on new, warm supersofts for the final 12 laps, it would make sense.* The team was protecting itself from a possible move by Ferrari to pit Vettel onto supersofts and then have him attack them at the restart, when he would have been right behind on faster tyres.

The top line is that there was a transition from Virtual Safety Car to Safety car; at the end of Sector 1 of the lap on which he pitted, Hamilton had a lead over Rosberg of 26.802 seconds, more than enough to pit with a comfortable margin. A pit stop at racing speeds takes 24 seconds at Monaco and at Safety Car speeds you only need a gap of around 17s to make the stop and retain position.

*What happened was that Hamiltons Sector 2 time was slower than he or the team expected; he took 53.240 secs to complete that sector, while Rosberg took just 44.5 secs. The gap came down from 26 seconds to just 18.*

Hamilton lost time behind the Safety Car, in other words, when it picked him up. He then lost another 1.5secs in the pit lane, thats how much slower his stop was than his first stop (which had been the fastest of the day). Nasr went past in the Sauber just as he was due to be released, which added a little to the end of the stop.

As soon as it happened, everyone realised that the move had been a mistake, but as Toto Wolff says, the calculations didnt keep up with the eventualities. Alarm bells should have gone off when Hamilton came through the Sector 2 beam and the gap had been reduced to 18 seconds  this made it a risky move to pit Hamilton. There was little time to think; Sector 3 takes 28 secs to complete across the finish line at Safety Car speeds and so they would have up to 20 seconds before he would need to enter the pits.

As for his reaction many people seem to have forgotten he lost the 2007 WDC on a team call to stay out a lap longer than he should have on tyres that were down to the canvas. I doubt the similarities of the two situations will have been lost on him. 




 You say potato etc. 

Money is unlikely to be a major issue for anyone in this particular situation whatever anyone needs they will get, and it isn't necessarily up to RBR depending on the contract terms he has already - Jos is a canny man.

Williams admitted two races ago that Lotus were faster than they were in a post race radio call, both teams are currently outpacing RedBull handily, both have better engines and better development tracks.

Generally speaking for GP drivers the more promotional work the worse off they are, and it's something that the older they get the less work is in their contracts. 




 Either team would represent a move up the grid from TR. 




 Fair point, but the SNP aren't a single issue party. 




 Button's comments on the same situation last year:

But is Lewis strong enough to come back? I really think he is. You will see a more determined Lewis at the next race. Canada is a circuit he loves.

I remember with Lewis that when we had a tussle in a race or there was an issue between us or with the team, he would have a really bad race and be quite outspoken and emotional. **And the next race he would destroy me, he would come back stronger than ever**.

The mind games people play on him will not work.

Initially, he is an emotional character and he will be quite hurt but he comes back stronger than ever.

Monaco is a really special race for Hamilton, especially as he's had such poor luck there. But he's a lot tougher than he used to be and Rosberg is the one that chokes under pressure. 




 Toto issued an [explanation](http://adamcooperf1.com/2015/05/24/toto-wolff-we-got-the-maths-wrong/) - interestingly they have no GPS at Monaco so their calculation was a few seconds off. 3.5 seconds off to be exact!

The simple answer is we got the maths wrong, said Toto Wolff. We thought we had a gap which we didnt have when the safety car came out, and Lewis was behind the safety car and the calculation was simply wrong.

It was the teams decision. We are all in this together, we make decisions together and it is not one person to blame and we win and lose together and that is clear. In Monaco you have no GPS and this makes the whole exercise more difficult, so this is why we got it wrong when we switched from the virtual safety car to the safety car. 




 Hamilton built a 20 second gap over Rosberg at Monaco - *Monaco* - that really says everything you need to know about the pair.

Basically Rosberg wins when something goes wrong for Hamilton. 




 Anyone with any sense wants Max, but only RBR have the race seat. Merc's options would have to be paying Lotus or Williams to take him on in order to steal him away from RedBull. 

I suppose both of those things are possible in 2017 (Massa's contract ends) or if Lotus tire of Crashtor. In fairness someone somewhere must be having a conversation about Grosjean's future as his contract is up this year, so perhaps both Lotus seats might be available in 2016. 




 Real problem for Farage is that actually having a referendum removes the rationale for UKIP's existence for voters, especially in the EU elections. Whichever way the country voted in a referendum UKIP would be spent as a political force.  




 When you look at their longstanding platform and voter base they pretty much did. One would have to say hubris driven by their best ever election performance. 

Vince cable described what they got during the coalition as "crumbs from the Tory table". The membership of the party could have overridden Clegg at conference on several occasions both on the Coalition deal and on policy. So what I take from this is that, rather than stand up and vote for what they believe in, both the politicians and the party faithful were willing to compromise any position they held in return for those 'crumbs'. 









 I don't think the team need Hamilton yelling at them to know how badly they screwed up. The look on Toto's face said everything. 




 They don't need to rule it out - there is no army to send, or budget to pay for it. 




 Basically the article is an opinion piece based on the beliefs of a recently departed staff member and there is no evidence to back it up, it doesn't even mention her position or salary, merely her judgements on others working status. 

The rest is a mish-mash of claims about a group of companies that mostly consists of non-profit NGO's specialising in project design and aid-delivery who maintain staff in the regions where aid is delivered and actually have a pretty good reputation in the aid sector. The 52,000 in the headline is based on the alleged average salaries of the staff at some of the companies, but is completely unsourced.

The remainder is a rehash of claims made by the DT in 2012 along with some sexy sounding, but obviously biased words like 'fat-cat' and 'barron'.
 


































 I don't see a road back for them at this point. What's the rationale for a LibDem vote after the Coalition? Voters know they will compromise every principle they have. 









 The giant global recession that began in 2008. Economic growth has not returned strongly enough so companies need to keep cash on hand incase of another downturn or other economic 'weather'. Households are doing the same i.e. they have less money to spend on the sponsored products.

Equally true that many western countries have hit market saturation for many products and the law of diminishing returns applies - one of the many reasons F1 is going to new countries and new markets in order to tempt sponsors along.

Sponsors won't really come back until the economic climate improves. 














 To be completely honest I'm a little bit happy about being shorn of the 'Scottish Mafia' - a group that has held sway over policy and strategy since the dawn of the Blair era - perhaps this will help the party to new thinking. 




 I don't think they would want to be seen as interfering in the political process - now everyone knows this is happening people will demand the publication of the report in full, and its unlikely to be favorable to the eurosceptic position. 




 True. But public perception is everything. 

Balls has never been popular, he was about the past not the future as far as most are concerned because he was so closely hitched to Brown's train. 

It was a dreadful mistake to allow him to camp in the shadow chancellor's seat for five years - there was no greater signal to the public that our economic position had not changed and we had failed to learn the lessons of the past. 




 I'm curious now. I thought the same but given how [busy the airports](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/irish-people-are-travelling-home-from-all-over-the-world-so-they-can-vote-to-legalise-gay-marriage-10268990.html) turned out to be with people returning home to vote that might be enough to change the result.

 We have not resigned our seat, but we have no genuine influence within the Security Council. Thanks in large part to our appalling behavior in going into Iraq with Bush, the joke that was our military performance whilst in Iraq and Afghanistan, our absent Navy and outdated airforce. We have nothing serious to offer anyone - as our laughable part the Libya operation proved.

The City of London has been on fire since the recession, little has been done to combat the cultural problems that led to 2008 and it's the banks that have the power, not the treasury. Just look at HSBC's startling intervention in the election campaign - it feared a backlash from no one. An EU exit will lead to the serious players leaving en-masse. Preparations for such an exit are well underway at a number of companies I work with.

We sold Oxford, Cambridge and Sandhurst to the children of dictators and international students when we ceased properly funding higher education. Every university is entirely reliant on private funding and income obtained outside government to stay alive.

We are almost exclusively reliant on private finance, charity, visitor centre income or EU funding to preserve our world heritage and nationally important sites. I had a conversation with English Heritage last year seeking emergency help with a literally collapsing 400 year old listed monument - no money, unlikely to be any money for a decade, I was advised to apply to the EU or the lottery 'thats all we do'.

We remain culturally influential but we're not taken seriously in any office outside Downing Street. The idea of the special relationship is a thin and distant memory because it relied on our ability to influence Europe and military support. 




 And the team. 

But a point most people have missed over the last few years is that RBR were winning with an underpowered car and relying on aero in the corners for speed - so there is more than one valid approach. Many of the problem RBR are seeing this year are issues that they've had plenty of time to resolve, they just didn't consider them big enough issues in the past. 




 The realities of design, testing, and manufacture. The tyre compounds are designed a year in advance, more even. While the tyre companies can tweak during a season they can't fundamentally alter their approach - we've seen the same thing with engines over the last two seasons.

In essence whomever gets the approach right at the start of the season will win, anyone else is screwed. 
























 Yes, senior members of UKIP think so too. UKIP failed to convince 600,000 voters who actually did vote for UKIP at the Euro election to so again at the general - losing support throughout the campaign.

While the figure nationally is impressive, but it failed to win the seats it had a good shot at. Even Carswell lost support. 




 12 months ago UKIP were competitive in 11 seats, in February they hit a poll high of 17%, and fell to 12% at the end of the actual campaign. By any reasonable standard thats a failed campaign, more people wanted to vote UKIP at the start of the campaign than actually voted UKIP at the end of it. UKIP supporters would do well to think about why that was.

Interestingly their polling bounced briefly on each debate, but fell sharply in the week afterwards. 









 They did lose 600,000 voters compared to the European Elections. 




 Also doesn't require 6 buses of riot police to escort rugby fans to the ground! 




 Admittedly its taken 24 years for an active F1 driver to compete in Le Mans, but Hulkenberg just finished the race [not mentioning the result]. 




 True. We're just as bad though. England fans have [sung anti-IRA chants at Scotland supporters](http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/nov/19/england-fans-anti-ira-songs-scotland-match-audio), Celtic routinely sing [pro-IRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82MXTJrJtTY) chants and sectarian songs.

If you offend easily don't go anywhere near an old firm derby in Scotland and avoid Millwall fans like the plague. 




 I suspect he's in the running to replace Kimi if Ferrari don't pick up the option in July. Ricciardo's availability is uncertain, Williams almost certainly have an option on Bottas, so Hulkenberg would certainly be in the frame. 

Having a driver with long experience of the Mercedes powertrain would certainly be attractive to Ferrari, which might swing their thinking away from Ricciardo. 




 The BBC reported the story as it affects the UK and none of the victims were British - the problem here being teenagers becoming radicalised, not waves of suicide bombing victims.

I really don't see the issue with their take because the greater tragedy is that he's not alone and others are being groomed as we speak and that will only result in more victims. 
 




 In law the licence fee is a tax and because of that the BBC has the same prosecution power HMRC does. 









 What she was alluding to was power structure and privilege - the currency of distribution and decision making rather than overt racism or gender discrimination. The two are very often confused, but also often intertwined.

I'll give you a real world example this goes back to the 80s. 

My father belonged to a village golf club near the large town I grew up in. The golf club wasn't open to female members unless signed in by male players and there were no BME members despite the nearby town being highly diverse. It was in modern terms actually sexist and functionally racist even if the latter was only partially intentional.

My father was not wealthy, upper class, nor were the other club members, but his job involved the distribution of public money into building projects. All the work went to other club members, while deals were not done on the golf course the relationships that drove the decisions were made there and only there. The councillors who made decisions on projects were members too - all very cozy - not actually nor intentionally corrupt but functionally so.

Over 30 years that meant that enough public money to build around a quarter of a million housing units went to the denizens of one very small village golf club and seven or eight businesses located nearby. Those relationships persisted for more than a quarter of a century. That was just the way things were, and are, done. 

Basically there was a privileged power structure around the club which was both racist and sexist in some form and completely exclusionary.

This wasn't some well known gentlemen's club for the super rich, or a parliamentary cabal controlling the country, it was simply how things were done everywhere. The vestiges of that power structure remain - they are far less overt in the 21st century but they absolutely exist.

In short form all she did in a professional context was make a poor choice of words on a university twitter account 'white trash' which she admits was wrong, and ask white people not to attend a meeting specifically BME women. There were some additional tweets, but those were on a personal account, unconnected to her work and are indeed how that community expresses itself.

 




 That's a straw man argument you've constructed around what *you* think her job is. As a white male I'm not offended nor am I injured by being *asked politely* not to attend an event specifically designed for BME women, its actually a very reasonable request.

As to her comments in the video response she's completely correct - it's a highly academic view and few will understand it expressed in the way it was, but it is accurate. In my society I am not robbed of opportunity by my race or gender - many people are and without good reason. Many right wingers will argue that isn't the case because of positive discrimination and what they see as reverse racism, but they don't exist in a society where the appearance of their name on a CV causes it to be removed from consideration, nor do they exist in world where there is debate over the validity of their Englishness because their parents were immigrants or they were born into a given religion. What most right wingers complain of is actually perceived loss of power.

His job is to teach and mentor. Half his student body is female, as are many members of staff and colleagues on his advisory panels. Expressing this opinion is utterly disabling to that work and basically means he can't do that work without concerns over his partiality. 




 Yes, its referred to in the original guardian piece. 




 What he said was not merely controversial, it was absolutely wrong no matter the context, it is an outdated and thoroughly incorrect gender stereotype for which there is no justification whatsoever. He accepts this.

Had, as he now claims, his remarks been intended in a jocular, ironic way, one would imagine he was attempting to start a discussion over the role of women in science. Instead he dismissed the contribution of his female students and colleagues summarily and now complains that he has been dismissed equally summarily, even going so far as to suggest labs should be segregated. 




 No they weren't. He didn't conduct a discussion on the matter with the audience, he didn't invite questions, he simply made his speech and left. 

He is now claiming the greatest hits - moment of madness - remarks were meant to be humorous - not sexist etcetera. 




 We apparently believe as a nation that this kind of treatment has been warranted for politicians or other public figures for more than 30 years - this treatment is the raison d'etre of the tabloid press. 

Nobody raised an eyebrow over the countless people the Daily Mail or the News of the World did this to - celebrities, we are told, deserve it because they have 'chosen' to be public figures. Social media has allowed that standard to apply to every walk of life. It might be wrong, but the way you're applying it, is a double standard.

The point is that it's obvious to any reasonable person, in the light of his comments, he is unable to do his job with any credibility. 




 Bahar Mustafa isn't a senior academic and doesn't have a role in educating and mentoring the next generation of scientists. Its not the same thing at all - and her words were met with equal derision and scorn. 




 Turned into?

Where have you been living all these years - have you seen the way we operate the criminal justice system let alone the tabloid press? 




 You missed the part where he called for a sexually segregated workplace. He made it very clear that women have no place in *his* lab.

He seems unaware that he summarily dismissed the habits of every female scientist at his academic institutions and the workplace behavior of every woman he has ever practiced alongside in two sentences. His female cohorts were not given any quarter or any right of reply - so why should he receive different treatment?
 




 There was no ambiguity in his remarks, he left no room for doubt about his opinion of female students or women in the workplace. How can he possibly operate in any 21st century workplace having said what he did? 




 There is no justification for his remarks - he admits that himself. 

His complaint is, in essence, that he has been denied due process and the speed of his dismissal was cruel. 

He seems unaware that he summarily dismissed the habits of every female scientist at his academic institutions and the workplace behavior of every woman he has ever practiced alongside in two sentences. His female cohorts were not given any quarter or any right of reply - so why should he receive different treatment?

He cannot, having said what he did, have any shred of credibility in the classroom or as an adviser.

The problem, he proposed, was that men and women fall in love in the lab and that this was disruptive to science. Moreover, he said, women cry when their work is criticised. For the good of science, he suggested, labs might be sexually segregated.  









 Its funny that the more people know about what's actually happening with the car the less happy they are with the racing.

Pretty much all of these arguments were deployed each time we've had a major engine shift since the 90s - I heard some of the complaints made in the first turbo era! The whole point of shifting the technology platform *is* to slow the cars down. The speed always comes back. 

Yes, the racing has become dull, especially this year, but its simply a need for closer racing. 

In the 80s and 90s everyone was going nuts because engines lasted 5 minutes and the cars were held together with tape. Now everyone is getting upset because the engines and cars do last. Having whinged endlessly because hard tyres made dull races, fans apparently want them back. The same goes for refueling and whole host of other things. 

The world and its wife is wishing mortality would catch up with Bernie whilst lionising the age when he did actually have full control of the sport - in this era the teams are in charge but the problems are all Bernie it seems. 

Everything old really is new again!

Murray Walker talking about the 1986 Spanish Grand Prix in 2013:-

It was a race that was all about fuel management and tyre wear - don't let anyone tell you that the current era is the first in which drivers have had to take care of their cars during a grand prix! 




 Remarkable how quickly Cameron has turned into Major.  














 I don't disagree, but I was referring to the period following the election. 




 Given the only budget areas not affected by Osborne's latest cuts will be Education, Health and International Development the plan seems to be to cut so hard and so deep everywhere that no one knows what the hell is happening. 

The plan, such as it is, appears to be the Teapartynomics pioneered by Bobby Jindal in Louisiana and Sam Brownback in Kansas - ultra low taxation and spending on the grounds that allowing the super rich more wealth means they will invest more. It has unsurprisingly failed spectacularly and killed growth stone dead. 

Interestingly Kansas actually has a law requiring a balanced budget, similar in nature to Osborne's blatantly political Mansion House idea. 

I grow more concerned with the policy ideas of the atlanticist faction of the Tory party each day. 




 It depends on the system but under most forms of PR UKIP would have gained 80 or so MP's and the SNP 30. You can argue about the electorate, but ultimately 35% of the UK electorate *chose* not to vote including  29% of the Scottish electorate, despite the stakes involved. The gap between the yes vote and the general election vote is more credibly explained by lower turnout and a divided vote among the Unionist parties.

The fact remains that the SNP would *still* have a majority in Scotland in any Westminster system you choose, and the Scottish Parliament elections yielded a similar result to the GE even under PR. My libertarian friends would describe that as the tyranny of the majority (I think they're nuts) but that's where it is.

If you take the Indyref and general election results together with one eye on the manifestos then Scottish voters voted for either DevoMax or Home Rule - certainly the latter is what is being sought by the SNP and the polling on independence since Indyref shows a narrow majority in favor of separation. No credible observer of politics doubts there will be another referendum in the next decade, but the SNP need to build a credible fiscal case and solve the EU membership issue. My bet is they will seek a federal setup and then argue for independent membership of the EU.

You can't sit there and ignore the size of the victory based on a felicitous argument about PR whilst pointing at the 29% of Scottish voters that gave up a say in the matter as if that proves something.

Personally I favor PR with mandatory voting and a none of the above option. 




 I haven't argued that the FPTP system isn't unrepresentative - in fact I've been a lifelong supporter of PR and would rather have had AV than FPTP even if the electoral reform offering was the worst form of PR. 

Its certainly the case that this election was the most unrepresentative result in British electoral history - but that doesn't make the SNP's achievement any less of a success - it certainly is a vote for some form of independence. No matter if they achieved 59 MP's or a more reasonable 30 MP's it's still a landslide any way you look at it. 




 I really don't see how you can argue that with growth down, recepts down, debt, borrowing and deficit up, employment growing but only at the bottom end of the job market, and facing a guaranteed period of economic uncertainty driven by the referendum that the UK is well placed to handle shocks. 




 Well, in actual fact you're the one choosing the goal posts. Since your original point was that the FPTP is easy and that's why the SNP won - you've since gone on to argue that FPTP is easy for the SNP and difficult for UKIP. 

My point was that the Scottish result is a massive achievement - a landslide victory for the SNP in every possible way. If you really wish to contrast the two the SNP removed a manifesto commitment it has had for 20 years and moved to home rule agenda driven by the result of the referendum. UKIP moved further right than it ought to have (according to their own people) and, riven by internal schisms, failed in 9 places where it had a very decent shot at victory. In essence, buoyed by fleeting successes, it tried to compete everywhere and split its focus. Basically UKIP tried to run before it could walk and would have done much better had it pursued the SNP's more focussed strategy over the last 5/10 years.

You also can't argue that the SNP benefited from the referendum and not acknowledge that UKIP benefited from the Euro elections and two by-elections in a similar fashion.

The SNP has sought PR throughout its history, UKIP having had a campaign failure, has suddenly seen the light on PR and I have little sympathy for its position for that reason.

Clacton wise Carswell had 53.0% of the vote in 2010, 59% in 2014, and *fell* to 44.5% in 2015 - still a massive result, but it has a great deal more to do with Carswell being a trusted MP than it does UKIP policy, given that UKIP had no national manifesto at the time. Indeed Carswell, having failed to become UKIP leader seems poised to leave the party. 




 I don't disagree that the election system is unrepresentative for small parties, but you're attempting to use this fact to argue that the SNP vote is not a major achievement. 

UKIP won the votes of just under 7% of the English population, whereas the SNP won the votes of just under 30% of the Scottish population - the SNP's success was far larger than UKIP's.  




 So you're arguing that FPTP is an easy electoral system for the SNP, but a difficult one for UKIP. 




 No it isn't. You need an extraordinary swing 8% to move the needle especially when there are two strong parties in the same spectrum. As a result of the Tory and UKIP position at the last election Labour would need at 10% uniform swing to gain office, just as the Tories have complained of bias because the collective strength of Labour and the Lib Dems has meant they would need a similarly large swing to gain a serious majority.

The SNP managed a 30% swing - unprecedented in the history of British politics. 




 No. All of the polling conducted since the referendum shows greater than 50% support for independence, even among unionist party voters - it really is quite extraordinary.

It would appear that many in this sub can't accept what is happening in Scotland. 




 Nonsense. Last quarter's growth sank to 0.3% from 0.6% in the previous two quarters - the reason was the construction sector shrank by 1.6% again! Despite weak growth in services. Construction seems to be Osborne's bte noire.

The employment market is recovering but at the bottom end not the top end, which is affecting treasury receipts. More minimum wage jobs are being created than well paid jobs, and youth and graduate employment remains disasterous.

Borrowing is up, spending is up, debt is up, growth is down, the wrong kind of jobs are appearing. I can't think of a single one of his promises he's actually kept to! I don't see how you can possibly claim that Osborne is either well regarded or vindicated. 




 The downgrade in outlook is really a warning that the UK is very poorly placed to absorb any economic shocks. The uncertainty over a Brexit would form a potential shock, and a Brexit itself would be a giant economic shock. 














 Arrivabene has said there are [no guarantees](http://www.crash.net/f1/news/219831/1/arrivabene-we-have-drivers-that-can-jump-into-a-ferrari.html) over Kimi's seat because there are other options.  














 Its normal globally, and the UK has relatively low levels. Social housing, major infrastructure like crossrail - those two alone amount to around 20 billion in government spending during the last parliament. 

All major housing developments have a social housing component and to make that affordable for developers each receives some form of government assistance (profitability and cashflow on development is narrower than people think).

This is one of the many reasons government spending isn't like household accounts - if your home stops spending at Tescos you don't have to worry about Tesco going under. 




 To be honest most of the people I speak to think the nation has an overdraft and a credit card. Its embarrassing. 




 Default is unlikely but not impossible. The rating directly affects the amount of interest paid on the national debt - lower ratings = more interest.

What made the credit rating agencies look foolish was using the argument you outlined as a reason not to downgrade, and that was a very large part of the causes of the 2008 recession.  




 Osborne cut infrastructure spending to the bone which immediately caused a collapse in the UK construction sector, at which point he started pouring money into it all of a sudden despite his pre-election and 2010 promises not to. 

There were external problems as well, as you say, but no serious economists thought Osborne's initial zeal was wise in the circumstances. 




 Basically Balls was correct - Osborne cut spending, particularly infrastructure spending, too quickly in 2010 which tanked the construction sector and nearly tipped us into a second recession. He spent 2011 and 2012 backpedaling and the consequent rise in the deficit and spending hurt his targets badly. The 2013 credit rating downgrade caused a further rise in debt interest - these were among the reasons that he couldn't meet his deficit reduction targets. 'Plan A' went out the window very quickly indeed despite his rhetoric to the contrary.

The downgrade in outlook is really a warning that the UK is very poorly placed to absorb any economic shocks, and a Brexit would be a giant economic shock. 




 A very large part of the 2008 recession was that the ratings agencies didn't downgrade their outlooks or credit ratings so there was, in effect, no warning of the coming storm. 




 Wiping out the [deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Sector_Net_Cash_Requirement), officially known as the  Public Sector Net Cash Requirement, isn't the same thing as wiping out government debt - [debt vs deficit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25944653). Osborne intends to wipe out the former (around 80 billion) but won't be able to do much with the latter (1.36 trillion). 

Removing the deficit brings down the interest paid on the debt. The economic discussion is about how fast you can do this without destroying parts of the economy because that affects growth (low or negative growth increases the deficit). For reference government spending is around 46% of the economy down from 55% in 2010.

The credit rating applies to government debt bonds, if the rating falls too low then banks are not allowed to invest in them and it also directly affects the value of the interest we pay on the debt which is currently accruing at 2 billion a week thanks to the deficit - the lower the rating the greater the interest. There is a decent explanation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating).

This is very bad news as it indicates low confidence in the financial stability of the UK and its ability to meet its obligations. 



















 You could make the same argument about virtually any policy area you care to mention. 

The point of a democracy is for those in power to make a case to the public for the policy direction they wish to take (I don't believe this is done enough anymore). The public won't accept a direction they don't agree with and it will just end up in a giant fight, just as climate change has. 














 The grand prix there is going ahead in 2016 according to the site that cannot be named. 




 God I hope not. We need a clean break from the Blair/Brown governments. 




 I agree - but I'd also point out that the grey generation are some of the largest users of medical weed out there - and that's resulted in opinion changing among that age group significantly too.

Tipping point is almost there, we'll see it in our lifetimes. 




 Have a look around - most of the recent polling hits the same notes. I chose that particular link because it was the most detailed I could find - there is wide support for cannabis policy reform but little else.

My point was there is too much variation on the issue. Most of the polls on reform come out around 50 - 59% - not solid enough ground *yet*, but it's coming. Once the polling moves up an order of magnitude and the 2010 intake become senior then the main parties will change their approach. 




 You'd have to get the public to vote for a manifesto commitment to *really* change the core approach on drugs policy and there just isn't enough public support on the subject for real change.

You can fiddle with it a little, I'd much prefer an evidence based approach, but it's simply too controversial. Just look at the debate on prison reform. We can reduce recidivism by 90% with proper community based sentencing for non-violent offences, but the public don't want to hear it and the debate takes place over rapists and murderers just as the drugs debate focusses on dead teenagers, gangs, and evil drug lords.

For the LD's and Greens who have absolutely no influence on major policy its the easiest commitment in the world because there is no chance of their implementing it. 




 You can blame the main parties all you want to but the reality is it's [50/50 or very close to that](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2011/06/16/drugs-policies-dont-work/) across most public polling on the subject - which basically makes it a lose-lose issue. Until public opinion on the whole canon of drugs policy moves beyond 60% in regular polling governments won't touch it. 

Regular polling on Gay marriage hit the tipping point at around that mark. Drugs are well on their way to an evidence based approach after the 2020 general election thankfully. 









 Such is right wing thinking on drugs I'm afraid. 




 *Only* 50% really? 

We haven't had a national government with more than 41% of the vote since Major - according to the commentary three of the victories since 1992 were landslides and they had at most an 8% swing, 30% is unprecedented. The last time a national election turned out a 50%+ result was Stanley Baldwin in 1923.

The SNP discovered that talk of independence or another referendum were indeed a turn off for voters and removed it from their manifesto, they were given a mandate instead to fight for greater fiscal autonomy, their manifesto commitments essentially add up to home rule.

As I said earlier the Indyref and general election result taken together with the independence polling since the referendum appear to be a rejection of the timing and the plan for independence, but an endorsement of the idea and of moving in that direction and attempting to answer the key fiscal questions whilst resolving the EU membership debate. I would be very surprised if the SNP don't attempt to move for independent membership of the EU during this parliament.

The SNP are already moving toward fiscal autonomy, and the national government will either be forced into a federal approach or Scotland will move toward independence once there is greater evidence of Scottish national solvency. Any way you examine the outcomes it is a vote for independence or effective independence. 




 Thats not the case, this is just their latest prototype. They admitted a while ago that their dyno wasn't correlating with the track work and they couldn't figure out why. 




 The trade union conversation has really become about money more than policy. Labour members were asked during the last election to donate (a bit too frequently in my view) to fund the campaign. I certainly did - and that's what it comes down to. 

If we are going to decry the influence of money in politics be it left or right then we, the membership, have to be prepared to put our money where our mouths are.  




 They achieved a 30% swing and took 50% of the Scottish vote with 1,454,436 - double the vote share of Labour and fully half of the electorate on 71.1% turnout. In any electoral system thats a landslide. 

Personally I favour PR but you can't sit there and pretend this wasn't a landslide and a clear statement of intent from the Scottish Electorate. If there is a majority in Scotland for the Union it's an extremely narrow one 50/50 at best. Were the voting trends we've seen since 1997 to continue there will be independence in a decade or less. 




 What on earth are you talking about? 

The SNP won all but three Scottish seats under FPTP - one of the hardest systems to achieve that under! 







































 I think you may be underestimating the amount of switchers. 




 Perhaps unionist voters stayed at home, but if they did it would have to have been in small numbers, some Scottish seats saw 80% turnout! I really think you can't look at the Indyref and general election results together and not see them as a vote for home rule and eventual independence. The result also matches a trend in SP elections that has been going on since the first Lab/Lib coalition post 1997 - declining unionist votes.

Even looking upon what the unionist parties have to offer Scotland kindly I can't see a resurgence for them in Scotland without a very big screw up from the SNP that forces the electorate to look elsewhere for leadership. 




 16% lower turnout in the GE than Indyref easily explains the gap.

An overwhelming landslide in favor of a party that has had Scottish Independence at its core for 20 years might also be an indicator of intent. 
























 The level of population in remote areas has nothing at all to do with the expense of maintaining and delivering infrastructure to those areas. 




 What's amusing about your statement is that the eras many people in this sub think fondly of are all eras where Bernie had more power over the sport than the teams did collectively. 




 Interesting to note that the modern conservative party logo bears a striking resemblance to the [Tory Party](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Royal_Oak.png) logo 




 If you believe GE was not a vote for future independence then I have some beans you might be interested in purchasing. 




 The argument (as its made in this sub and elsewhere) is that Scotland receives more money from Westminster via the Barnett formula than Wales or Northern Ireland and therefore is well off. England is, in essence, a generous parent and Scotland should be happy with what it has because it couldn't do better on its own. It is as patronising and paternalistic of an argument against independence as exists.

The point of the remaining statement, as is quite obvious (because that's what the barnett formula pays for), is to serve as an example of why the basic infrastructure required in Scotland is quite different to that required in the majority of England.

If you have an opinion on what I've said state it plainly, I'm not playing the quoteback/leading question game. 




 The GE and Indyref results taken together suggest the people of Scotland were convinced of the idea of independence but not the timing or the details of the plan presented for it by the SNP. 

The fact is that if the referendum campaign had run another month or two Scotland would be independent now - that cannot be ignored. 




 Its rather like the Eurosceptics that argue that we must repatriate powers from Brussels. Ask them what powers and the response is "all of them", ask what problems this causes the UK and the response is "big ones" or "we must free ourselves from the EUSSR" - its a definition free debate.

So Cameron has said he wants treaty reform, but hasn't defined what that looks like (same situation for Thatcher and Major), allowing him to get what he can and either claim its the path to treaty reform which is a slow process, or claim that this is the best deal we could get, and declare victory. My bet is the latter.

Arguably this is what Thatcher did with the rebate and Major did with the Social Policy exemption. Thatcher regretted her decision and 1970s support by the end of her premiership.

Ultimately we want the trade and military support without the federalism and don't see that as a lack of reciprocity - just a recent surveys have suggested the British want free access to Europe without Europe having free access to the UK. Its a very tiresome position. 




 Its wealthier per head only because some wag created a self serving argument that allowed the English people making it to paint themselves as generous and superior. As an Englishman I'm embarrassed to hear such an argument made.

Anyone with any actual experience of living in Scotland realises that nothing could be further from the truth. Not least because England doesn't have to deal with the realities of getting emergency healthcare to a community 4 hours from the nearest hospital, or delivering education and utilities to villages so remote they are closer to Oslo than London. 




 Independence is inevitable.  




 The UK broke up in 1914, everything done since then regarding policy towards Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been part delaying tactic and part nation building. 

During the referendum campaign no major party leader could articulate a single sentence answer to why the Union is important, or a positive vision for the future of Scotland within the Union. The people of Scotland saw that and voted accordingly. 




 Precisely what Thatcher and Major did when confronted with the same problem - get some kind of concession and declare victory. 




 That is exactly what led to the FOCA/FISA war, the rise of Bernie from team owner to leader of the sport, and the invention of the modern FIA.

What the teams wanted was a team led sport, they got it, could not agree on anything and so left it to Bernie. 

The teams wanted control again in the early 2010s and that led to RedBull effectively ending FOTA, the creation of the F1 strategy group, the current financial settlement, and the present demands to leave it to Bernie again.

Past is prologue, especially in F1.

Bernie will give you exactly what you want and merrily watch it burn down around you whilst playing both ends against the middle. The object lesson being be careful what you wish for - you might just get it.

 




 There is every chance of his going full Schumacher. The reason that Ferrari are the only team to support refueling's return is they know there is more to running a big team than the car - data is key - and to win again they not only need to improve the car but also disrupt the rules in a way that affects Mercedes ability to calculate strategy. 














 To both you and /u/Kingy_who/ i'd point out that those nominations add up to only 162 of the 232 parliamentary party so there are still 70 MP's left to declare an allegiance. 

If past is prologue those members will declare for Corbyn and Creagh in order to ensure a debate. 




 The 7 most marginal seats have Tory MPs but with a collective majority of 900 votes. The next 20 have a majority of less than 10,000 collectively. 

It wouldn't take a dramatic improvement in the fortunes of the second place parties in the most marginal seats to wipe out the Tory majority. 









 Only 31 of the 137 F1 teams that have ever existed have won races, only 22 of those have won more than two races, and only 13 teams have won more than 10.

Even Porsche only won 1 Grand Prix.

Top 5 most wins in the history of the sport:-

- Ferrari 221
- McLaren 182
- Williams 114
- Lotus (58' - 94') 79
- Red Bull Racing 50
- Brabham 35

Only 5 of the 22 teams that have won more than two races are still active in the sport. 




 Get the election results spreadsheet and have a look at the bottom 100 seats. Even under FPFS the shift in the second placed parties combined with the change in electoral landscape make the loss of 100 or more Tory seats likely in any case. 

That's the real message behind this election - the Tories played well and scored a majority they didn't expect whilst everyone else fizzled out and arguably fear won the day - but the electoral landscape over the next two election cycles look very poor for both of the main parties as neither can count on their core vote in the way that they used to. 









 For the reasons stated above - in all the permutations of voting systems the Tories won the last election in terms of seats. However 7 of those seats are based on only 900 voters, the next 20 marginals less than 10,000. Their win is razor thin and they know it - 10,900 voters actually decided a Tory majority rather than a coalition.

They may actually need the additional votes nationally to count going forward. If the LibDems were to improve in only 2 seats, and UKIP in 5 and Labour 5 their majority is gone. Electoral reform might actually offer a hedge against UKIP depending on the system. 




 Rosberg to Ferrari  Bottas to Mercedes 









 I think the Tories are about an inch away from going for electoral reform themselves. What the Tories like to call the 'bias' in the FPTP electoral system - two strong left of centre parties meaning they would need an unlikely swing to win - has now reversed with the collapse of the LibDems and the rise of UKIP. 

The implementation of boundary commission's review is now not so attractive as it would create new and uncertain marginals and cost them 8 of their 12 seat majority at a stroke.

The inherent risk in the referendum is that it shatters the internal Tory coalition and does for UKIP what the IndyRef did for the SNP - creates a 'neverendum' situation with the added perils of defections to UKIP. 

The only way they might cling on were UKIP to become stronger is something like STV. 




 Well, they charge the traders, not the bosses. What we actually need to do is go after the people at the top - only then will the poisonous culture in banking change. 




 In the USA, Canada, and Australia illegal immigration is the serious problem. While we also have an illegals problem it's nowhere near as big as it is there. But we realise that interrupting commerce with draconian searches is a much more costly problem than the immigration.

We already have a points based system, it's based on the Australian system with the addition of tiering, and it works well - it's just a byzantine nightmare to navigate and it's very expensive to the user.   

Cameron's embarrassment is twofold - you can't crack down on non-eu immigration (which is the largest part) without hurting the economy, and open borders is a red line for the rest of the EU even though in many respects they have a larger problem with immigration than the UK does.

The bigger problem, from my perspective, with the amount of oxygen the ludicrous debate on immigration is sucking up is that the global economy is weak, the banks are far from under control, and if the pattern holds we are three to five years from another recession. 

Wasting time on a referendum and its attendant crowing will do nothing but put off businesses investment and allow the tories to ignore the economy whilst tearing the hair out in public. 









 Depends on the timing. If you could get it into a period along with several other big events, Pride for example and the Hyde Park concert series, Formula E, and maybe resurrect the British Empire Trophy as an LMP race, all while sharing logistic support, routes and facilities there could be a way. Having it around the British Grand Prix weekend would also cut shipping costs.

I've often thought staging the European Grand Prix as a series of events on road courses and moving from one capital city to the next - London - Paris - Madrid - Berlin - each year so the cost isn't entirely on one city might work. There are promoters who would take it on. 




 And yet their system often prioritizes unskilled workers - and the fact remains that the points system is only one of several systems!

The second study was one I mentioned, from the UKBA Migration Watch Committee because it's conclusion is complimentary but focusses on only A8 data. If you actually read the study rather than the hyperbolic press reports it too concludes that:-

We find no association between working-age migrants and native employment: (i) in buoyant economic times; (ii) for EU migrants; (iii) for the period 1975-1994. By contrast, we find a negative association between working-age migrants and native employment: (i) in depressed economic times; (ii) for non-EU migrants; (iii) for the period 1995-2010.

So outside of recessionary periods (Q2 2008 - Q2 2009) when there is positive growth there is no link, and looking at the wider dataset, as the first report does rather than just considering A8 data, there is also no link.

Youth unemployment has been a problem for some time - especially since the credit crunch struck in the mid 2000s. Looking at the geographic data it's mainly focussed in inner cities where educational attainment is poor. The shadow economy is also a factor - those employed in illegal enterprises still show up in the figures along with gap year students and young people working in the voluntary sector or caring for relatives.

Companies are less willing to train staff, less willing to hire younger people, and often have young people working in internships who are entirely supported by the benefits system or the bank of mum and dad. Public sector job cuts also disproportionately affect young people as the public sector is more willing to hire the young.

My good friends daughter was forced to work through four years of unpaid full-time internships prior to finding a job, another friend's daughter went for one of this government's much vaunted apprenticeships only to discover it was a complete con and she was stuck as the tea girl for a year both received JSA and were classed as unemployed throughout.

The reality is the majority of young people with good educational attainment are not competing for the same jobs as migrants. 




 My original claim was that the ''Australian' style system actually prioritizes many professions that UKIP considers to be unskilled and unworthy.' The points system doesn't consider skilled or unskilled it simply prioritises the professions the economy needs more of to expand and fast-tracks those, there is also a secondary general immigration system in place that takes 18 - 24 months to complete, and a third system dealing with de-facto partners and family. At the moment you'll get very high points if you're a general labourer or hairdresser because those are in demand.

Your point was that 'Points systems are designed to bring in skilled workers, not just to make up the numbers.' And that simply isn't the case - skills are not the issue, demand is, and you can still immigrate fairly easily anyway.

Odd that the highest periods of youth unemployment were between 1992 and 1998 and between 2008 and now. Quite how a quote on Labour's early 2000s immigration policy supports your argument on youth unemployment is as mystifying as your *highly* dated view of what working class is.

The Major report on the subject by National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is entitled Examining the relationship between immigration and unemployment using National Insurance Number registration data.

It concluded:

Our results seem to confirm the lack of impact of migration on unemployment in aggregate. We find no association between migrant inflows and claimant unemployment.

Overall therefore, our results indicate a lack of any significant correlation between migrant inflows and changes aggregate claimant count rates, in line with the general message emerging from previous research that migration has had generally negligible effect on unemployment rates.

In fact studies by The Borders Agency Migration Advisory Committee, NIESR, and a review of the data by Oxford Universitys Migration Observatory all found no significant link between immigration and youth unemployment or employment in general. 




 They had talks on this in 2014, Westminster Council is actually running a consultation on it this year - there are serious moves afoot. 




 You very much mis-understand the post war landscape and economy based your commentary. Especially the Blitz, London was the worst hit city with over a million homes destroyed, but that amounted to less than 10% of the housing stock, in Coventry only 2,306 houses were destroyed and all of that had been rebuilt or replaced by the end of the war - not in the post war years. 

Given your quote on points based systems "Points systems are designed to bring in skilled workers" you have been proved wrong - the point of a points based system is to focus on the economies *needs*, not to differentiate between skilled and unskilled. 

Youth unemployment is always high after a recession, it has zero to with immigration. Kippers do love to have it both ways - we're allegedly awash with unskilled migrants and they're competing with educated British youngsters for the same jobs. Hmm. No serious research substantiates this and no serious economic thinker believes it - the same thing happened post 1992
 




 Yes a great deal of people had been killed in the war, but we still had to embark on the largest national housebuilding programme ever completed to accommodate the returning troops, refugees, and foreign troops that fought with us - in excess of 1.5 million European people including 180,000 of the 500,000 German POWs who chose to stay despite being used a slave labour after the war.

But the fact remains that we had 16 working people for every pensioner in the UK in 1948, by 2000 that number had shrunk to just 2. Far from 'maintaining industrial productivity' we were desperately trying to rebuild industry of all types - everything had been repurposed for the war and the country was virtually bankrupt.

Right now our working age population is 32.7m out of an estimated population of 63.7m, fully one half of the population are financially supporting the other half.

Points systems are designed to bring in skilled workers, not just to make up the numbers.

Points based systems are in fact designed to flex with the needs of the economy for almost all of the 2000s Australia's most sought after skills in the points catalog were hairdressers and general labourers. Since the majority of net migration is non-eu and our system is already points based that would suggest that UKIPs assumptions about the needs of the economy are somewhat out of step with reality. 




 Our birth rate had sunk so low that we were a decade away from population shrinkage, and our pensions (75% of the welfare budget) had become perilously unaffordable. We needed more working age people between 25 and 45, there is only one way to achieve that.

Filling the population gap with immigrants is exactly what the 'Australian' points based immigration system was designed to do.  














 Probably around the time Farage stops dismissing losing manifestos as drivel, and stops making NHS policy, and other policy on the hoof.

But UKIP does have ideological ground based on its recent manifesto - authoritarian, statist, neoliberal-ultranationalist-conservatism.

Actually what bothers me about the UKIP manifesto is the ignorance of it. We already have in place a points based immigration system based on the Australian one and we have had since 2008, all non-eu migrants on a 3 month or longer non-tourist visa already pay a 200 annual fee for health insurance prior to entering the country, in addition to being required to have travel insurance with repatriation and medical expenses cover. Those from the EU are covered by a reciprocal system - presumably Farage is aware of this as thats how he's covered when working in the EU. 

Apparently UKIP is seeking this 'Australian' style system, even though a whopping 23% of Australia's population is foreign born and their system actually prioritizes many professions that UKIP considers to be unskilled and unworthy of in work qualifications like hairdressers, general labourers, stable hands, and horse groomers.

The list of policies in the UKIP manifesto that are already in place is actually very long indeed. Having read the document it seems to be entirely based on what UKIP supporters think is happening in the country as opposed to what is actually happening.

In general UKIP places, morally, what the UK taxpayer pays for, what UKIP considers to be foreign citizens, above what EU governments pay for our citizens, even though the number of UK citizens claiming benefits in the EU outnumbers the amount of EU citizens claiming benefits here and our system is less generous. The party also gives not a moment of thought to the stresses placed on EU government systems by the 2.1 million UK nationals living in the EU even though 400,000 of those people are pensioners and the population we've acquired in return is 98% of working age, but lionises the alleged stresses placed on our systems by migrants. In other words UKIP likes to present itself as a party of fairness, balance, and reciprocity for work but is nothing of the sort.

Its also deeply amusing to me that under UKIP's manifesto if Boris Johnson or Daniel Hannan were prosecuted for speeding they would be deported - both being foreign born citizens - no matter their immigration status.  




 I should have added 'fear' - it seems to be the strongest motivator for UKIP supporters. Just exactly what are you afraid of?

There are 2.34 million EU Nationals living in the UK, and 2.1 million British citizens in the EU (400,000 of which are pensioners). Our age dependency ratio has finally recovered to a point where we can actually afford our pensioners and that wasn't the case in 2000 when we had two working people for 1 pensioner (in 1948 we had 16).

Of the UK citizenry as a whole 11.9% are foreign born (a group that includes Daniel Hannan and Boris Johnson). That's a lower percentage than the USA, Canada or Australia.

UKIP supporters keep jumping up and down and claiming the world is on fire and the surest sign of that is apparently immigration, not the state of the global economy. Frankly the gut-wrenching small mindedness of the party's platform as a whole makes me weep. 









 Fundamentally I agree that we need to be fairer to people, but thats not the rhetoric UKIP is famous for. 




 That experience includes several hundred hours of online debate and 70 hours of doorstep campaigning in Croydon Central during the last election. So yes, it is solid evidence. 




 What he actually said was:-

"motivated to some extent by racism," while others voted for UKIP out of "despair," believing they were "some kind of anti-establishment party".

Having debated with UKIP supporters for some time both of these statements are entirely accurate. Many of the UKIP supporters I've spoken with fixate on the notion that someone, in essence 'less deserving, is getting something they're not. It often appears that the heart of their arguments is an unfocused feeling of loss of power.

Many UKIP supporters - particularly those on the DT - refer to 'The Establishment' in a negative context and claim their party is funded by its membership. They're often upset to discover that the party's major donors are all members of 'The Establishment' and all donate to 'LibLabCon' - you might be forgiven for thinking that those donors are only after a peerage.




 




 I think if he's consistently qualifying the car below its potential and not challenging Seb regularly in the next few races then Ferrari will give more serious thought than they appear to have at present to replacing him this year. 

Personally I believe they already wanted to replace him at the end of this season, but it depends who they want to go with next, and what's in the way in terms of that driver's contract (Seb is also a consideration). Bianchi obviously put a crimp in their long term plan.

If he can't get his qualifying sorted out then, were I Ferrari, i'd go find a younger driver with good speed and hire them on a short contract. Hulkenberg has the speed, Ricciardo or Bottas would make excellent long term replacements. 

If they wait a year Rosberg would be out of contract (it's *so* hard to challenge Lewis in the same machinery - I wonder if he's sending a message), and Verstappen or Sainz might be ready for the big time - both have been very impressive. 




 The point is that other drivers could deliver more in that seat than Kimi has this year and do so more reliably - Ferrari drivers generally leave the team when there is a large gap to their teammate. 

Massa for example was consistently earning points, but placing 6th in the WDC when Alonso was turning in 2nds or 3rds. Kimi's situation isn't that bad yet, but it is moving in that direction, and his qualifying is a serious problem - it might easily make the difference between 2nd in the WCC and 3rd. 

So the question is twofold - Is he justifying his salary, and is he helping the team more than hurting them? Right now Ferrari could acquire a driver with more potential on vastly less money and still achieve the same or better results.

Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of Kimi's, I'm not saying he's a bad driver. 














 Hamilton on Vettel in 2012:

"I think hes a true champion," 

"Hes polite, hes never in trouble, hes squeaky clean and a genuinely nice guy. He speaks incredibly well and carries himself really well. And at the end of the day you have to do the job even if you do have the best car."

The most dominant car/driver combos in F1 history are (in order of percentage of victories in a season):-

- Ascari's 1953 Ferrari 500 (75%); 

- Schumacher's 2004 F2004 (72%); 

- Jim Clark's 1963 Lotus 25 (70%);

- Vettel's 2013 RB9 (68%);

- Fangio's 1954 Maserati 250F A6GCM (66%);

- Schumacher's 2002 F2002 (64%);

- Jim Clark's 1965 Lotus 33 (60%);

- Vettel's 2011 RB7 and Hamilton's 2014 W05 (57.89%);

- Fangio's 1955 Mercedes W196 (57.18%).

So right now he's tied for 8th on the all time dominance list with Vettel. The distribution of those dates says quite a bit about the history of the sport. 




 Its a more complicated calculation than 'is he delivering on track' - he's a great driver no question, but is he delivering results and experience at Williams another driver couldn't? Not really.

Williams (have said publicly, indeed Massa himself has said publicly) that they've hit the point where money is more of a drag on the team than driver experience.

Massa is also 34 and at the end of a three year deal, from his point of view he remains marketable in other series with his current results (but knows that won't hold forever), from the team's point of view they could hire a driver on a third of his salary and still deliver the results they're getting. So it might be good timing for both to part ways.

Younger drivers also tend to come with sponsors that could help the team (I don't mean pay drivers), and are generally more attractive to sponsors. Its equally possible Mercedes might cut them a sweetheart deal on engines to take a Merc young driver - they're making a play for Verstappen. 



















 Singapore + Melbourne + Monaco  









 It won't hurt either, that's a fifth of their losses last year - 10 mil is not pocket change. 




 Totally awesome! 

I've been wondering if the reticence at Lotus over the Renault sale might be an early sign there is an investment coming from Mercedes or a Mercedes aligned business - they will be wary of the Ferrari/HAAS effort and need a guaranteed seats for their young driver programme.

Ricciardo would make a great choice for a resurgent Lotus. 




 I agree - its a much more complicated calculation than just results. 

Every time Rosberg says it's hard to race Lewis in the same machinery I wonder if he's telegraphing a message to Ferrari. If they did keep Kimi for another year Rosberg would be out of contract at the same time that they would be looking for a replacement. 

Really unlikely though, as you say. 




 I think thats what they'll probably do. 

But it's possible for them to make a calculation and take in a youngster now who has potential, or a cheaper driver that could produce reliable results without challenging Seb.

When you consider Kimi is on $26 million a year including bonuses, Rosberg on $14.8 million and Hulkenberg is on $4 million and Bottas $1.1 million there are considerable savings to be had. 

Might be fun for Ferrari to make a play for Rosberg!! 




 Its a more complicated calculation than 'is he delivering on track' - he's a great driver no question. 

Williams (have said publicly, indeed Massa himself has said publicly) that they've hit the point where money is more of a drag on the team than driver experience.

 I totally agree, they owe him for all the development work he's done. But they've reached the point of diminishing returns on the development and, at this point, its the money more than the experience holding them back. 

Equally on track Bottas is starting to overhaul him more regularly and overall, they could get better shopping around. That wasn't true last year. 




 All true. Really I'm saying that he isn't extracting the maximum benefit from the car for the team reliably enough and that's what generally does for Ferrari drivers. That spin allowed Bottas within 20 points of him in WDC, which is a big deal (as you say though, not 100% his fault, but it does beg a question).

Equally Ferrari could hire Bottas, Hulkenberg, Ricciardo or Button and likely achieve more reliable results for less money. 




 I think it's mainly the qualifying performance for me, along with a few too many avoidable incidents like the spin. Really if Kimi still had the *reliable* pace he used to then he'd be worrying Seb for third on the grid in quali every time out and I just can't see that happening on a regular basis.  




 Senna had 162 race starts, Hamilton is on 155 as of yesterday and Vettel 146. 

So, no, they have not had more 'chances' than Senna.  




 Seb to equal it first, Hamilton will surpass it first. 




 Plenty on eBay and Gumtree - also check out the coach trip packages from nearby cities. 




 Kimi is one of my all time favorite drivers and he deserved three WDCs (Damn you McLaren reliability). 

But even I think that he isn't performing well enough for Ferrari after the last few races - what changed my mind is that, looking at Seb's racing, other drivers could do more in that seat than Kimi. 

Same thing applies to Massa. Williams would be foolish to keep him in that seat much longer. 









 Couldn't agree more. 

I get that the candidates are 'taking out the trash', jettisoning and disowning anything that proved to be poisonous or that we lost the argument on, in order to allow the party to build a new platform but we're beginning to sound like the Conservatives. 

I can't help but think that the leadership candidates all come with the word 'interim' etched all over them.

We appear to have lost more than the economic argument. 









 What has Red Bull gained from its media 'war' with Renault - nothing but bad publicity, loss of faith in the team once it was clear that the chassis was also a problem, and the regular embarrassment of its senior team members when they were caught out blaming everything on Renault.

So I'm with McLaren on this one. Honda will get there eventually and its not worth blowing what will likely be a fruitful partnership once they get the engine working. 














 I don't see how its unfriendly - all the race data (and an amazing amount of it) is within a couple of swipes and thats a very tricky thing to handle UX wise. The menus and the rest of the app are quite annoying, but the in race stuff works very well indeed.

They even have text *and* audio commentary and allow you to download and replay the race. I used it a couple of weeks back to follow the race whilst taking the kids around Comic Con. 




 Both at the same time! 




 This is available in the current F1 app. 









 This places him 5th in the all-time list and less than 400 laps adrift of the 4th spot which is held by Vetell. If the season carries on the way it has so far he'll surpass Prost and possibly Senna in this record.

Hamilton had 49 entries in the driver record books at the start of the season and he now has 57 - the only people ahead of him are Vettel and Schumacher. 














 These are 5th components so I would assume additional 




 And about a dozen radio stations. 




 This went out on the RBR twitter feed just now - which is where the link is from. 














 I'm a British fan and Sky F1 is British channel with a British audience - there is plenty of non-British commentary to choose from. 




 Last year he definitely did, as I say he kept locking up. This year is a different story though. 




 It depends on what country you're in. I paid 20 quid for the year mainly for the live timing during races. You can also pay monthly. The app itself is free so you can download and have a look. 





























 They get taken out as time penalties - so he's gotten dropped to the back of the grid and has a 10 second stop go at his first pit stop. 




 Look none of what you've had to say so far is at all correct - especially what you've written above. I strongly urge you to read up on the *actual* history of the sport, especially the concorde agreement, the formation of FOCA and the FOCA/FISA war, again.

You'll note this year that FOM has launched a social media effort, which is actually pretty good. What you don't appear to have understood at all the complexity of the commercial rights behind it. The point Bernie was making last year - was that social media, while desirable, is expensive to implement, staff, and isn't going to make the teams the kind of money necessary to enhance the sport and it is therefore very low down on the order of priority for FOM. 




 You are right of course - ultimately businesses that are friendly to the community will have to advertise that is the case instead - there is already such a scheme for B B's. 




 I don't think anyone is really arguing that people should be forced to do things they are uncomfortable with. After all the fundamental of the LGBQT marriage debate is that people who disagree with LGBQT marriage don't have the right to force that opinion on other people's lives through the state or the church.

But if you're not a gay friendly business then you *should* advertise that fact to avoid embarrassment for both parties - but bakeries, just like B B's, don't want to advertise that they're not LGBQT friendly because it might hurt their business.

Therein lies the rub - those unfriendly to the LGBQT community are well aware that their views are outside the mainstream and that once this becomes known it could damage their business even amongst the straight community. Not only that but several of the bakeries have said that they have no problem with LGBQT customers, they just object to wedding cakes - that is a perilous line to tread - your money is only good for some purchases, but we won't tell you that unless you ask.

A little over a generation ago people were refused service by churches and many wedding businesses because they were divorcees seeking marriage - interestingly that was treated as an absolute wrong and the debate surrounding it was a lot less angry than this one even though the fundamental issue is identical. 




 I used the official F1 app to listen to the race commentary whilst taking the kids to Comic Con London the other week - stream cut out frequently but it worked very well indeed. 




 The teams needed to be incentivised to improve reliability. 




 Because when any driver does that much overtaking it always ends up being labelled a demolition derby - happened to both Hamilton and Rosberg last year.

Points mean prizes. 




 Craig Scarborough is suggesting its been an ICE change. 









 You're thinking of gearboxes - thats a five place penalty. 




 No, if they are fitting a new unit and Eric Boullier used the word 'new' then he'll have to take a penalty (assuming this is engine 5). If Eric misspoke and they're installing a reconditioned unit then he'll get away with it. 




 I have a feeling we're watching the early days of a Hamilton/Rosberg style duel that will be fought out over a number of seasons in the future - something that may suck for Ricciardo.

Totally agree though I'm not questioning Verstappen's natural talent, but he'll struggle to get anywhere with the attitude he's been displaying, just as a certain Spaniard has. Many have pointed to this attitude being displayed by other champions - but they had established themselves first.

 




 Honda confirm its the 4th on twitter + Mclaren's account using the word engine - assume they would be more specific if it was just the turbo or MGU-H

https://twitter.com/McLarenF1/status/607170579037343744 




 10 for a new engine isn't it? 




 It turns out they are fitting a new engine and I guess that means a grid penalty - no FP3 for Alonso https://twitter.com/LauraLeslie23/status/607170597853007872 









 Or a demolition derby.

I've been very disappointed by his reaction to the Monaco crash, and it's not lost on me that Sainz is beating him hands down right now. 




 You only get to a position like Bernie's by being constantly successful at cutting deals allowing you to build a power base. He made it from a driver to team owner to the de facto leader of the sport. No one else in professional sports has been able to achieve that while managing the complex politics surrounding sports management, which is why no one else has a comparable record.

Bernie became powerful because he's very good at what he does and that makes his record all the more impressive. 




 It would be a 15 place drop, if he doesn't qualify high enough a time penalty too. 


































 The NI ban is heading for a [Judicial Review](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/northern-ireland-gay-marriage-ban-first-uk-civil-partners-win-judicial-review) so I imagine it will end up happening the same way as it did in the US. 

The last assembly vote was 47/49 against with four SDLP members failing to vote despite the whip. After the Irish referendum minds will have been changed - as I said its a question of when not if. 




 Aside from Keke Rosberg (far from mediocre) who won only because the other contenders died racing, can you point me to these mediocre drivers that have won the WDC? 

Looking through [the list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers'_Champions) I can't see a single one. 

Edit: Pironi was appallingly injured, Villeneuve died. 




 The most dominant car/driver combos in F1 history (in order of percentage of victories in a season). Your point stands as this only looks at car/driver rather than teams - but its interesting non-the-less:-

- Ascari's 1953 Ferrari 500 (75%); 

- Schumacher's 2004 F2004 (72%); 

- Jim Clark's 1963 Lotus 25 (70%);

- Vettel's 2013 RB9 (68%);

- Fangio's 1954 Maserati 250F A6GCM (66%);

- Schumacher's 2002 F2002 (64%);

- Jim Clark's 1965 Lotus 33 (60%);

- Vettel's 2011 RB7 and Hamilton's 2014 W05 (57.89%);

- Fangio's 1955 Mercedes W196 (57.18%).
 









 They have had several close votes in parliament, but the executive has decided not to press ahead with legislation, mainly because they really do have much [bigger problems](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/02/northern-ireland-crisis-talks-fail-resolve-stand-off-welfare-reforms) to deal with at the moment. But there is a majority in the assembly for same-sex marriage so it isn't a question of if, but when. 




 If you want split hairs about the status in the UK then have your claim, its wrong, and all but a small amount of the population have access to same sex marriage, but there you go. 









 It didn't. We've had civil partnerships nationwide since 2004, same sex marriage in England and Wales since 2013, Scotland and the Pitcairn Islands since 2014. The only laggard is Northern Ireland where same sex marriages in performed in the rest of the UK are treated as Civil Partnerships.

Also notable that it didn't take the UK Supreme Court to decide the issue, our democracy (mostly) did its job. 




 I didn't realise it was them - I could never get a good enough look at the logo without attracting unwanted attention. Have they rebranded? 














 No. The type of leaflets and magazines they hand out are.

There are so many people involved, and the quality of the leaflets is quite high, I've been wondering where the funding is coming from. 




 Is it me or does there seem to be some kind of Christian Fundamentalists outside every London train station during rush hour? 

The two who stand outside my local station sing (not very well) - not the most conducive addition to the morning commute 
























 People simply aren't that original. Examine any online password dump and you'll discover that much. 




 Personally I see this tension as the core of the issue. 

There are groups that want to view marriage as a purely religious construct and therefore their rejection of LGBQT marriage or anything associated with it is a matter of personal freedom of choice and therefore protected - but that simply isn't the case and it hasn't been for a very long time because of the depth of legal status of marriage in national and international law. 

Attempting to limit access to marriage denies fundamental freedoms to LGBQT people - freedoms so fundamental that most people barely think of them or realise that they're even there until they don't have them.

Ultimately everyone is free to accept or reject LGBQT marriage in their personal lives, but they don't' have the right to impose their beliefs on other people in society and thereby limit other's freedoms for no good reason. 

Why wouldn't a baker, for example, that doesn't wish to service LGBQT couples simply put a sign in their shop window to that effect? This would save everyone embarrassment! The reason is that they know that such a sign would hurt their business even among the straight community - in other words they *know* that there is a difference between their personal beliefs and the functionality of their work.

On the company issue, I don't have a problem with your position and I don't think it's bigoted, but I do think it's unrealistic. Can we really live in a society where the personal religious views of a company's CEO affect *your* partner's ability to receive part of *your* pension should you die? Equally if that is the standard then why couldn't a company turn around and refuse to pay survivor benefits to anyone regardless of their sexuality - these things cut both ways. 




  Your MP is someone who will steadily sacrifice all individual rights in an effort to defeat invincible encryption.

This is cynicism. You failed to even attempt to understand this person's perfectly reasonable position and dismissed it out of hand. I don't agree with her position, but I at least recognise it as accurate from a statist standpoint.

I say this as a 20 year IT veteran. *There is no privacy* the idea that there was at some stage some kind of privacy in our lives was a construct based on security by obscurity i.e. government and private enterprise was in possession of much data in paper or quasi-digital form but lacked the tools to centralise, regurgitate and mine the data in a meaningful way - obviously that has changed significantly.

Recently a security firm went out in Victoria Street in London and asked people for their passwords and email addresses in return for a free coffee or a chocolate bar - 78% of respondents provided those details - that is how little people care about their own privacy, security, and that of their employer. 









 Is there a real need to be cynical about her response? While I don't agree with what she has to say her position is reasonable and any party in power, or with designs on power, would hold exactly that position given the security briefings they receive and the diffuse nature of the threat. 
























 Its a very big thing indeed - its all very well for people to argue that marriage is a religious status alone but that simply isn't the case in modern society - so many of our legal systems and international laws are built on conveying rights via the simple term 'marriage' that those without the ability to marry are quickly deprived of basic rights by simply stepping over an international border.

Survivor benefits could indeed be conveyed by contracts but there are a couple of big problems with that. Firstly it's within the discretion of the company - Apple will pay out, Hobby Lobby won't. Secondly when it comes to insurance its a matter of the legal term - legally they're only required to recognise the status of certain relationships and without a change in the law that doesn't happen because it would increase costs - this leads to LGBQT people paying more for certain kinds of insurance and having to have specially drawn up wills etcetera.

 




 Yes to the former. The term 'marriage' is codified into so many international laws, treaties and intra-legal system recognition agreements that LGBQT couples literally need to be in something called a 'marriage' to obtain basic rights when travelling or moving overseas.

To be clear a same-sex couple with a civil partnership conducted in the UK could not emigrate to Canada as a married couple because the UK law isn't recognised there. If the same couple were travelling in Canada and were in a serious accident the partners would be unable to make medical decisions for one and other, and in some cases their family (if they disapprove of the marriage) may seek to prevent one from even seeing the other (sadly this has happened).

Re:survivor benefits - if your marriage isn't recognised you wouldn't be able to obtain life insurance payouts, death benefits from an employer, pension payouts etc. This leaves the surviving partners in a very tricky financial position. 
























 I think 'came out in favor' is a bit strong, they punted - hemming and hawing, until it was clear which way the wind was blowing. Nikki Haley showed more leadership than every single one of them put together! 

Have to say its also very convenient for everyone that the zeitgeist was about the flag and not the dead bodies or racist militias. 




 I'm aware of the irony but on level I'd rather pay into a system I do believe in even if it is, relatively speaking, expensive. I get far more value out of R4 alone than 12 quid a month could buy elsewhere. 




 Personally I only pay the licence fee for Radio 4 as I don't watch TV at all anymore. 

I'd happily pay a separate licence fee just for radio. 




 Done. 




 The flip-flopping on the flag issue was so huge that you could hear the floundering splashes of the GOP candidates from England!

I agree on the marriage issue but punting it to the states is the classic get out clause. In world where married persons need their marriage to be legal and valid when they cross international borders and partner benefits can mean survival is that Libertarian position tenable? 




 If anyone is able to identify the buttons and controls visible I would be very grateful. /r/formula1/ also wonders if that is an early sequential shift or manual 'H' configuration with the gate removed for fast shifting. 









 It is. But...

Here in the UK Churchill (a lion of the right wing) didn't consider the NHS or Welfare State Socialist, and wrote as much. That's not a position that a modern Conservative in England would recognise. Our right has drifted further right in some policy areas to the point that in policy terms, thanks to inertia, there is no recognisably left or centrist party - I'm beginning to wonder if left/right is even a useful distinction.

In the US the GOP has gone *so* far right/authoritarian that it's practically a fringe party - but the Democrats are, as a function of that drift, being pulled further right in order to hold their electoral coalition together. So Obama's Democratic party are essentially occupying the same economic space as Reagan albeit with a much more liberal view of society and individual freedoms.

I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing to be honest with you. 




  galvanise them like crazy

Wild ride for sure, but these decisions combined with the confederate flag issue just force almost all the GOP candidates into the ideologically pure far/fringe right.

I can't see a GOP candidate being taken seriously in the general with any of the positions these guys are taking. 




 I'm curious why the liberal side of the court limit the ramifications of their decisions this way. Is there a strategy to the method i.e. they are doing it to satisfy a particular justice's preference, or limiting the usefulness of the president in future cases? 




 Big win! With the distribution of subsidies in the tax code any future president could have wrecked the law easily. Thanks to this decision, which specifically says the tax rule was not required, the Republicans are completely done and cooked - they can't attack the law even if they win the presidency. 




 Oil / brake fluid maybe?

I imagine it must have been pretty hot in there! 









 Renault takes a stake, perhaps the 25% it sold recently, the team work through the Mercedes contract and take the Renault PU when its ready. 




 Ok, show me the evidence in token spending rate that the problem is actually the freeze (this year there is no freeze) The teams are free to spend their tokens as they like right now, yet they are not doing so... 




 - Its a democratically accountable team led sport and has been since Red Bull broke up FOTA.

- The role you've outlined for FOM is exactly what it does already. 

- The role you've outlined for FIA is exactly what it does already.

- The sport tried the arrangement you're suggesting and it was a disaster.

The only problem F1 has is that the teams cannot work together and can't agree on anything - and that has been the case since 1950.

F1 really only works when the FIA and FOM are aligned - Bernie then brings the teams together by fair means or fowl. 









 Mercedes made an offer of a deal on the 5th engine, the other teams did not agree with the terms, and therefore Mercedes would not vote for a fifth engine. *This is how governance by committee works*.

We had a FISA dictatorship, that lead to the foundation of FOCA and the FOCA/FISA war, the formation of the FIA, and that is what propelled Bernie into the position he holds today. 









 The strategy group **is** composed of the teams, FOM, and the FIA. 

All that notwithstanding the 'golden eras' of F1 that the fans in this sub seem to lionise are all eras when F1 was a dictatorship. 









 Its the same every time the engine formula changes, it just takes a while for everyone to catch up, and we had great racing last year in any case. 

Everyone is complaining about the engine regs, but, looking at the rate of token spend, the problems Renault and Honda have are way more fundamental than even unlimited development could fix. They can't make the systems they have work.

Also F1 is a business as are the teams. From Mercedes perspective they've invested four years and close to a billion dollars on that car - how is it then fair to ask them to basically cease their development and allow the other teams to catch up? 




 I don't think that, given the circumstances, this was an option. Whatever actually happened it was clear that trust had evaporated between Alonso and the team. Equally, with Kimi, it wasn't clear that his driving was a real problem for the team last year given the dog of a car they had produced for him. 




 If you look at Austria even the Mercs couldn't follow each other such is the dirty air pouring off the car 2 seconds in front. I agree with much of what you say but I think the front wing changes between 2014 - 2015 haven't helped the racing, and therefore engines are not the only problem. 




 Ultimately its a business decision - Raikkonen's performance issues have dragged the team's media coverage into negative territory for two season's straight - drowning out positive coverage of Ferrari's nascent improvement this year and becoming constant distraction for the team.

I say this as a huge Kimi fan who thinks he should have been a three time WDC winner. Kimi is a serious problem for Ferrari. He isn't delivering on track and he's not promoting the team well either - his 'fuck you' approach to media was refreshing when he was delivering in races, now it just looks foolish and unengaged.

Ferrari could get a more consistent driver which would do more for their image and performance elsewhere very easily. Bottas appears to be the obvious choice, IMO it should be Hulkenberg or Ricciardo, but at this point any of them would be better than the present situation (Sadly. Very sadly in fact.) 




 What the Police 'know' and what they can prove to a sufficient degree to make the information public are two very separate things.

Making the information public also makes the suspects scarper quickly. 




 I'd contact your local MP and cc their parliment.uk email on any email communication/complaint with the police. Letters with the portcullis logo on or emails that CC parliamentary addresses tend to focus minds.

Also find out the name of the chief constable and then contact them directly via email cc'ing your MP, the format is usually firstname.surname@domain.name (minus the www). Its surprisingly effective. 




 Yep, the barrier has been there in some form since the advent of colour copiers and printers. 









 But relative to wages (which are 1,418 lower in the North) the problem remains the same. 




 Telegraph and Mail took the same line. 




 No. That was Bernie's point about social media last year - the much derided Rolex comment. The point in plainer language is that engaging socially might be good for fans (and this isn't a reason why we shouldn't do it), but it can't provide the revenue or cashflow needed to operate F1.

Race fees and TV rights make up (50/50) $1.3 billion of F1's 1.6 billion revenue $1 billion of which is distributed to the teams. No amount of advertising or sponsorship on youtube or another streaming model will replace that kind of revenue. 




 Don't forget that the value of those TV rights is 50% of the prize fund that the teams rely on for a large chunk of their income. 



















 In terms of HGV's, buses and coaches we actually already do upgrade the safety features - the regime being implemented for HMO's is actually built on the same framework.

 









 Not quite - HMO standards are about implementing basic personal safety standards in housing, just as crash standards for vehicles are about implementing basic personal safety standards in cars.

 




 I get the point, but applying the argument you're making to cars would suggest that mandating crash standards for vehicles is a bad thing because it increases their price. 














 Totally agree! 




 Mainly to stop negligent landlords from killing people - which happens all too frequently even in this country. 




 I very much doubt that you have any experience or knowledge in the sector given the crass nature of your remarks and total ignorance of the law as it pertains to contracts and housing. 

What I said was that statutory protections for *tenants* would be a good place to start. Statutory Government safety standards for types of rented accommodation are *not* protection *of* tenants *from* landlords any more than the British Standards Kite Mark is protection of the consumer from harm - they concern quality standards and/or safety of product, not individual rights in a dispute. 

The only way a tenant can fight a non-financial, eviction, or semi-financial dispute with a landlord is in the civil courts (you would know this if you knew what you were talking about). I really don't know why the SCC is so important to you - it offers a service to landlords for rent arrears and has little use for tenants.

Anyway this isn't a discussion, you're completely wrong in what you had to say, and saying it with crass embellishments just makes you sound dumb.
 




 HMO works are a result of changing government standards which are enforced locally by the council. 

Actually both the government and the councils are victims of increasing house prices and private sector rents as they have to fund the housing of the poor. 




 Umm, no. I can see you have absolutely no experience of such matters and a poor attitude - 'hand holding' - really? What an ignorant thing to say.

There are standards for HMO's, which in *some* areas have to be licenced and inspected prior to letting, and there are standards for private rented accommodation which *should* be observed but these are *not* statutory protections for the tenant with criminal penalties attached - they concern the council's relationship with the landlord alone and the enforcement is exclusively civil. 

A tenant can complain and environmental health might turn up in 6 months and issue a letter to a private landlord requesting changes and threatening legal action if they don't undertake the prescribed work, but enforcement only takes place for serious multiple breaches and its a ponderous process. This does not affect the contractual relationship between landlord and tenant - it most certainly does not overrule the contract in the slightest which is an entirely separate legal document dealt with mainly by the county courts.

As to the small claims court you cannot take landlord/tenant (act) disputes to it, as it deals with money alone. You can pursue debts that way so it's of little use to tenants but very popular with landlords. 




 Not at all, if you know a little of computers and cars, the article is completely correct. It's distressingly easy to hack into cars - it has been for decades - and the problem is only getting worse. 




 Actual statutory rights for tenants (contracts are only worth the opposite parties ability to prosecute the contract in civil court), and a legal service that resolves landlord/ tenant disputes without dragging them through the county courts for years at massive expense to both parties would be a good start.

Protection from predatory landlords and letting agents, working environmental health services - the list is endless.  




 I think you can take that view if you wish but [experts in the sector disagree](http://www.propertyreporter.co.uk/property/could-tackling-multiple-home-ownership-assist-housing-crisis.html). In reality multiple home ownership isn't a symptom at all but one of a number of primary causes - lack of house building is another - all of which need intensive action.

We cant keep building to accommodate demand, land is in short supply, particularly in locations where people most want to live. In reality, there is plenty of property, but with some investors owning numerous buy-to-let properties, prices continue to rise making it impossible for first-time buyers to pull together enough deposit to make that first step. (Michael Riley, a former Head of Sales for Savills and Head of Operations for Romans in the Thames Valley) 




 That would be Bangladesh. We are [53rd in the world](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density) by population density. 









 The idea itself is not so fanciful, its basically what we do with a large number of shared ownership properties in the social housing sector - short term tenancies are a disaster for many in generation rent, disrupt social cohesion, and a fix for that problem is badly needed.

And in fact he does get it. There is a housing crisis in this country - private let landlords have benefited and continue to benefit from [14 Billion in tax breaks](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/landlords-14bn-tax-breaks-buy-to-let-expansion-mortgage-interest) - they are a group that has grossly profited from their own shrinking of the housing stock which by turns pushed up house prices whilst pushing locals out.

Personally I'd much rather listen to some radical ideas on the topic than the baleful ignorance of Cameron and co whilst they plunder the working poor and disabled. 
































































 Fully paid is a bit of a stretch - there are bursaries available but most nurses don't get anything like their full ride paid for. 

Presently we do train  20k nurses a year, but you're correct retention is a major issue and to be completely honest no one brings their kids up to tolerate the conditions in the health service. 









 You could argue the same thing about any trained profession but, as you say, retention is a huge problem within the NHS because (having half a dozen nurses in the family) many trusts treat nurses extremely poorly, pay is relatively low, and conditions can be dreadful. There is little flexibility so nurses like my sister, despite having the PhD level highly specialised qualifications required for top end intensive care nursing, end up in 9 - 5 desk jobs because the trusts can't think of a better way to handle her having a family.

All that said its also true, from a UK economic perspective, that people who receive degree level training earn far more through their lifetimes than people with lower skills qualifications and contribute more to the economy. So it actually doesn't matter if they stay in the profession the country still benefits economically.

Non degree average starting salaries are  17k compared to  31k for those with a degree. 




 If you think what they're doing in this area of policy is bad you should see the utter balls up Grayling is making of the criminal justice system!

I was hugely disappointed that there was no examination of the coalition's record in government during the election. Health is a mess, immigration, environment, education and criminal justice are very unfunny jokes. 




 There were 20k nursing places last year and over 50k applicants - we have plenty of people who want to be nurses we just don't have the commitment to education needed to train them because its expensive.

In the meantime a temporary solution to fill the skills gap has become the norm. 
























 I wouldn't call it poor at all but it can be a little simplistic. 














 Bernie doesn't own the rights to stream anything, streaming licensing is organised at national broadcaster level e.g. Sky in the UK, RTL in Germany etcetera.

This is why a global streaming solution isn't happening. If FOM wanted to do this they would have to amend the terms of every existing F1 broadcaster contract and/or pay the broadcasters for the privilege of streaming their own race. Even that would only solve half the problem. FOM provides the TV pictures as part of their licensing agreement but it's the broadcasters that own the IP for the commentary and the would have to be paid for that.

50% of the prize fund that the teams get comes to F1 via broadcast rights, so you would also have to be careful not to hurt the teams financially when making the deals to put a streaming solution together.

TL;DR Streaming F1 races has nothing to do with Bernie or FOM because of the way the broadcast licences are organised. 




 Car hit a crowd gathered for an F1 event - many killed sadly. 




 Are his comments on German TV much different than in English? I've always wondered how much not speaking their native language affects what people like Lauda, Alonso and Massa have to say and how they come across in interviews.

Seb's generation obviously grew up speaking English from a young age and his command is amazing - he has colloquialisms, understands and uses sarcasm, tone, inflection etcetera - many other drivers don't seem to have as much depth. With Massa especially I often wonder how much we're missing of what he's really thinking.

*This isn't intended as criticism of anyones English - just an observation.* 




 I love that he's willing to get in the mix be positive and back people, too many of the older drivers seem to spend their time being negative about the current era and questioning if the drivers are any good. 




 I was honestly amazed no one else had posted it!

Thanks due to Ernie Black the F1 poet https://twitter.com/TheF1Poet/status/612249373511143424 














 Basically the safest most conservative strategy that would get the to the end of the race with the maximum result. In essence no stops and as little overtaking as possible with all the work done in quali.

That's really the problem and the reason we have to mix up the rules all the time - to increase the challenge and disrupt the team's data models. 




 All empires do - its simple inertia.  




 I completely see your point, but if there was such a point they would have found it already, we're about where we're going to get with degrading tyres. The real problem is dirty air. 




 Sure it is, but you saw the consequences of too conservative tyre choices in Canada - 1 stop races and long stints. 




 I don't disagree, but that is the way the sport has always been. Fangio's trick was winning at the slowest possible speed. 

Moreover that's not the debate we have i.e. the debate in this sub and among fans is frequently utterly uneducated. All of the things I listed above are allegedly ruining the sport - only that wasn't the case in the 80s or 00s.

The only difference is people are more aware of what the drivers are actually doing. 




 The News summed up: 'Good Morning, here is a list of reasons why it isn't.' 




 You're going to need to explain that one! 









 Yet the sport has been there before and it was profoundly dull! There has never been an era in F1 where drivers were on the limit every lap. 




 Many fans claim the 80s and 00s were golden eras of F1 yet these are periods where tyre and fuel management really was to the fore, third placed drivers were often lapped, a small number of drivers won everything in sight, and the organisation of the sport really was a bi-dictatorship between Bernie and Mosely.

The more people know about what's happening the less happy they seem to be.  




 Some have run the power deficit numbers and say that the chassis is as good as Ferrari's.  














 Even Schumacher didn't care about the records, the top drivers really don't - they just love the racing. 




 When you look at her actual complaints it's quickly clear that the BBC were simply ahead of their time with reporting standards and language control - all of these things can be found in every modern news broadcast. 




 Eurosceptics have been conducting a public campaign against EU membership since 1992, arguing that they haven't had enough time to make their case is ludicrous. 












































 This is presumably why the No camp wanted a separate date from the other elections going on in May next year.  




 In this case we have [tracking data going back to the late 70's](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/11617702/poll.html) to back it up. 




 Whilst I agree, by the standard you're applying Cameron wanted the Scots to leave the UK. 

Cameron wanted a straight up or down vote, Labour wanted DevoMax put to a vote, Salmond wanted the out campaign to be 'Yes' and the date. It turned out to be a very profitable deal for Cameron and Salmond. 














 Yes. 





























 Its a pity its yet another proboscis - the Mercedes nose looks far smarter. 




 Because they're human beings. 




 The people who come first on any housing list are those whose need is most urgent - homeless people's need for shelter is vastly more important than my desire to buy a home. 

I have a roof over my head and a warm bed to sleep in, I certainly wouldn't take up any scheme built on the backs of people less fortunate than myself no matter their nationality. 




 Couple of things. For one many EU nationals that end up homeless in London are actually working homeless, they're just too poorly paid to afford housing even 'sheds with beds'. This is symptom of the housing crisis and there is plenty a Mayor of London can do about that.

For another many mayors when facing similar problems create repatriation schemes or stage advertising campaigns in other countries to dissuade people from coming to begin with. 




 I've (and many others) have said it time and again - the benefits to 'ordinary' working class people for free movement of people and more generally an open immigration policy NEEDS to be made.

I think most people especially in this sub, from the way 'ordinary working class' is routinely used, think of the working class as those engaged in un/semi skilled manual or industrial work and forget completely about the working poor. The definition is in fact those without the ability to live on accumulated capital. That includes increasing amounts people especially with the continuing housing crisis and the piles of student debt being accrued. You've got to throw down 5,000 to get a HGV licence these days on top of 2k to learn to drive a car - a near impossibility for many people at 18 no matter if you're working or middle class.

As far a the benefits of freedom of movement go for 'working class' people go, you have to be in a position to move to realise them.

Care workers, oil rig workers, IT workers and the like are all part of the modern working class can, and have, realised benefits by moving overseas where they are better paid or gain better quality of life - but the reality is that if you're on an hourly waged shift work job in a factory in Northampton freedom of movement is only going to put your wages under pressure. The only way to change that is to educate better and ensure access to education and skills training is freely available to all.

 














 75% of the welfare bill is pensions, much of the rest is working tax credits which fill in for employers who want the staff but not the bill. 

Employment benefits are not the problem and never have been (but they are an easy target) - Tory's like to forget this when making an argument about how undeserving the recipients of these benefits are - universal credit will only make the situation less transparent. 









 Indeed. But many UKIP supporters claim that the party is funded by its membership and that it is an anti-establishment party. Nothing could be further from the truth. 




 Nico was done psychologically after Spa last year - any time Hamilton can put him under pressure he cracks like an egg. 




 As you say, it's mostly based on sentiment rather than actual information and a lot of that is media desperation for heroes and villains style stories driven by near complete lack of facts or context.

The good stuff about Europe - the fact that its the only consumer regulatory force in the UK and the only force dealing with anti-trust, appliance energy ratings, tyre ratings, limiting the power of credit card companies, crash standards, road safety almost never gets any kind of coverage - very few even notice it actually comes from the EU. 









 It [isn't](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/11617702/poll.html) thats a claim based on one recent poll, and looking at 30 years of tracking data shows it to be a foolish claim. 




 Exactly right - it has been on the BBC London news though. It'll only make the national news if it's very big and something significant happens.

That said they allegedlly ignored [this protest last year](https://tompride.wordpress.com/2014/06/21/bbc-and-press-ignore-massive-demonstration-against-austerity-in-london/), only [they didn't](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-27962963) at all. In fact that march was also reported in the Guardian, Telegraph, and the Independent.

People on the right and the left always claim the BBC is biased against them, if they can't show intentional bias, then its biased by failure to report, or failure to give the story or story angle they see as important enough attention.

IMO it's mostly the bias of the person complaining showing, not the BBC. 









 Its the classic Es*sex* *Anal*ytics problem - filtering is hard. Trying to filter the web is a fools game. 




 Interestingly both Carswell and Hannan were born overseas, both spent most of their childhoods overseas, and both have one Scots parent. 









 - UKIP received 4,376,635 votes at the Euro Elections in 2014, a national scale election, but received 3,881,099 at the general election - a *loss* of 495,536 voters.

- In Thanet Farage received 16,026 votes, Thanet North and Thanet South together cast 28,123 votes for UKIP, but virtually the same area elected a UKIP council with 54,230 votes.

- UKIP was polling at 17% in January but only received 12.6% of the vote.

- UKIP didn't get a poll bounce from the leaders debate, and actually dropped in the polls immediately after the challengers debate.

- UKIP performed poorly in all 12 of its top target seats and was beaten into *third* by Labour in half of them.

- It actually *lost* vote share in four target seats based on its 2010 and 2014 performances: South Basildon and East Thurrock -4.43%, Croydon Central -24.45%, Rochester   Strood -11.6%, Clacton -15.3%

In other words Farage isn't nearly as good of a campaigner as people think, and the major UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler (who paid for the campaign) was correct when he described the election as "a failure". This is the reason why there was a leadership coup following Farage's un-resignation. 




 It doesn't need Farage to polarize it and looking at a list of UKIP donors the party is basically paid for by *The Establishment**. 

Just look at yesterday's shenanigans in the House of Commons. Basically the Eurosceptics can't even agree on the rules amongst themselves let alone with anyone else. We have two years of this nonsense to look forward to and the public are already exhausted by the clap trap spewing forth over the issue.

* UKIPs main donors 2001 - 2013 (total, of which less than two million came from other sources, 9,554,314): Paul Sykes, Stuart Wheeler, Julian Blackwell, Sir John Craven, Lord Neidpath, Viscount Michael Cowdray, Lady Yvonne Vinson, Lady Yvonne Collin, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Clare Barbour, John Malcolm Richards, Christopher Mills, Robin Birley, Crispin Odey, and Andy Brough. This is basically a list of bankers, brokers and the landed gentry - all of whom are seeking UKIP Peerages. 





























 This is how you advertise you're available in F1! 














 Hahahaha!

The lengths Kippers will go to in denying the facts never cease to amaze.

Its almost like you haven't read the news or followed whats happening in the party. 




 You've had the proof, you just can't acknowledge it. 




 You were done and cooked halfway through the argument - you haven't had a leg to stand on throughout. 




 Give up mate, it wasn't a misquote and you well know it. 

The man is a former Express journalist and the party's communications director - he knew *exactly* what he was doing. The quotes were given in a deliberate interview which included similar attacks from a number of senior UKIP members.

Its very sad that you've allow yourself to become this deluded. 




 At this point in the discussion its up to you to demonstrate I'm wrong about O'Flynn and since I was right about his comments you can't do that so now you're simply denying reality.

You can't accept that the election result was actually a failure for UKIP. 









 Aww what a desperately cute effort. None of the argument I've made rests on the Farage / O'Flynn relationship.

Attempting to suggest that UKIP's GE Campaign Director, MEP, and Director of Communications, a former journalist has no relationship, or hasn't previously been supportive of the party leader is simply ludicrous.  




 Oh dear oh dear, is that the best you can do? What a pity. 




 What an utterly laughable claim you've made there. The man resigned over the attack!

I know kippers tend towards an alternate reality, but this is beyond the pale. 




 O'flynn said:-
[Farage] Had become a "snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive man"

He went on to say

"The team around Nigel himself need to reflect why it was that Thanet voted in a Ukip council but didnt vote in Nigel as the MP for Thanet South."

Similar attacks were made over the leadership un-resignation and GE results by Diane James, Suzanne Evans, Stuart Wheeler and Paul Nuttall.

It is you who don't have your facts straight, and have a somewhat rosy view of the election result. 














 I think you need to read the article and the quote. Wheeler described the campaign as "a failure" in an interview, which I've linked to, in The Times immediately after the election. Patrick OFlynn launched an extraordinary personal attack on Farage at the same time - both over the poor execution of the campaign. Pretending this didn't happen or that Wheeler or O'Flynn don't fit the description of a senior members of UKIP is simply ridiculous.

We're taking the GE as a baseline for two reasons firstly its a comparable national scale election, secondly just about every UKIP shipper on this sub has claimed that the Euro elections were a predictor of UKIP's performance in the GE - they're right. 

Labour's performance in the EU election made it look much more competitive in the GE than was the case. The only pluses from the Labour perspective is that it took every Lab/Con marginal, and the 7 most marginal Tory seats were decided collectively by 900 votes. The very most marginal seat went blue by only 47 votes! The next 20 most marginal seats were collectively decided by less than 10,000 votes. That means the Tories are highly vulnerable - Labour or the LibDems could easily call a by-election in a marginal they hold at the right time and sell it as a referendum on Cameron's leadership.

The whole GE was a great deal closer to a coalition than it looked. 




 Stuart Wheeler is a *very* senior member of the party, one of its longest members, and its largest donor - the UKIP equivalent of Lord Ashcroft. Patrick OFlynn was your campaign director - there are no two people in the party more senior save for Farage himself.

You're under the impression I'm criticising the party or its platform - in actual fact i'm offering an analysis of the result from an electoral standpoint - whine about the electoral system if it makes you feel better but the system we have is the system we have and UKIP must play that game. 

The purpose of an election campaign is to convince voters to vote for you taking the euro election as a baseline UKIP actually lost votes, seats, and saw a 5% drop in national support. 

Bluster all you want but it is the truth - Farage screwed the pooch. 




 Well, obviously you won't accept any criticism of what you perceive to be a major victory and confirmation that your position is well supported and valid. But the electoral truth is somewhat different, UKIP could have scored up to 10 seats, should have in fact looking at the tabs on the exit polls. There were back channel discussions with the Tories on this basis alone.

UKIP left the election red-faced and more importantly powerless.

But when one of your [party's major donors levels](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4440215.ece) an accusation like that at the leader's closest aide and calls for Farage to [face a leadership election](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/nigel-farage-facing-a-coup-over-ukip-leadership) because he fluffed the campaign, you would do better to listen rather than reject out of hand.

Edit: The paywalled Times interview above is the one in which Wheeler called the campaign a failure. Wheeler has donated close to 1 million to UKIP meaning he is solely responsible for 1/7th of the party's income since 2012. 




 Kassams detractors accused him of being a divisive Iago-type figure, dripping rightwing poison into Farages ear that harmed the partys chances of winning over moderate voters.

The accusation inside the party mostly exposed in the leadership contra temps post election was that Kassam pushed Farage too far to the right because he wanted a Tea Party Style campaign and this is what cost them the votes they needed to win seats.

Its been very easy for party supporters to blame the electoral system and focus on the national vote (UKIP after all loves grievance), but when you look at UKIP's performance during the campaign there is no doubt that the campaign cost UKIP votes - the polls show that.

UKIP lost a seat it had and should have won, failed in 9 other seats, lost 600k voters who were willing to vote UKIP (the hardest part is getting people to change their vote), and Carswell having received 59% of the vote in 2014 was elected with only 44%.

Thats the internal discussion inside the party - not the national performance, because the national performance doesn't matter in FPTP. 




 Indeed. I was mostly thinking back to the days when I lived on the Gorgie Road near Tynecastle stadium. Behaviour outside the grounds hasn't improved much though.
