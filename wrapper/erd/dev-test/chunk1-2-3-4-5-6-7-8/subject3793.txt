 Well, that was fast. 




 Named Arf Vader! 




 Yeah, but... is the health inspector a zombie too? 




 Perhaps he just alters his density. 




 Okay, so he's a legit butcher as well as a creepy zombie brain drug dealer? 




 In Eobard's defense, he didn't have time to bury Wells anywhere else, nobody suspected Wells was dead, and the first rule of murder is *never move the body*. 




 Okay. So next week Joe decides to just rob a bank. "Oh, it was... uh... my evil twin. Because there's this super speedy guy, so why not evil twins?"

And the week after that Singh burns down a building. "Oh, that happened because... of... a flaming ghost pig. I mean, there are shapeshifters, so why not ghost pigs?"

Just because weird things can happen, it doesn't follow that they did happen. 




 But this is the couple that is suing. 




  How strange would it be for a guy with a phd etc., to donate sperm? Pretty darned strange.

No, not really. You can make good money that way. Lots of people with degrees are unemployed or underemployed. Gotta pay off those student loans *somehow*. 




 They don't know Wells knows they know, though. Because they're stupid. 




  I don't think any kid thinks being sick or in pain is "cool", and I'm sure that once they're older than three or so they're aware that this is why people take medicine. 




 Good job, Eddie, for telling Iris at least part of the truth. You get a cookie.

Everybody else? WHY DO YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT WELLS AT STAR LABS? That can *not* be a good idea. You fools! 




 That almost looks like it could be a real word.  




 2024 isn't as future-y as it sounds, not anymore. 




 Did you think she was just hiding around the corner the whole time...? 




 That love story certainly would be worse than most, because ew. 




 No doubt they dropped the curtain on it when they saw her coming up the elevator. Down the elevator? 




 The kids at elementary school love to play "blastoff" which involves jumping off of things, and the main character's father is, among other things, famous for smuggling a peanut butter sandwich onto the space shuttle because he was tired of astronaut food, even though of course there's the issues of crumbs. 




 I think it's more important to model appropriate pain management than to model false stoicism. 














 I can see how you got that idea, but in truth there are people who really will argue, for example, that painkillers are unnecessary during circumcisions because "they can't feel pain" or "it doesn't hurt like it would an adult - they just cry a little and forget". 




 LOL, it happens :) 












































 Did you mean to say that you're NOT knocking weed? 




 No, they think it's okay for medical uses. Some applications of marijuana for medical reasons, like cannabidiol, don't have THC and thus won't get you high.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-big-trend-in-medical-marijuana--products-that-don-t-get-you-high-162609966.html 




 Yeah, if those were medicinal. 




 Hm. Maybe The Enchanted Forest Chronicles, Patricia C. Wrede? 

























































































 Peeing in the street is unlawful, and certainly unhygienic, but criminal? Not so much. What's criminal is the fact that there aren't enough facilities for people so they don't need to resort to nature's method. 




 Okay, it's a stupid law, but why were you walking around 24 times with a cup of beer after the first arrest? 




  she SHOULD be in an adult prison. she is dangerous

By that argument, every 36 year old dude who sold some pot should be in a juvenile facility. 




 Just checked wikipedia. Series 1 was released in 2010, Series 2 in 2012, the Christmas mini-episode in 2013, and series 3 in 2014. Series 4 is expected for 2016, so they're going about two years between series (using, of course, the British term instead of the American). 



























































 Although public urination is super gross, I feel like a better solution than fines is more public bathrooms in safe, more-or-less clean locations.

If it is decriminalized, I hope they have some plan for that. 




 Well, the place where the WTC is now was underwater in the 1400s. So you wouldn't. 




 Maybe they just don't like you. 




 Looks more like a rag than a legitimate news source. 




 Perhaps actual news from actual news sites? I mean, this might as well come from a friend-of-a-friend on Facebook. 




   Many don't sit down on the toilet but instead poop while standing on the toilet seat.

Just like how in the US, many don't sit but hover over it. People think it's cleaner because, you know, no butts. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of those people are simply more used to squat toilet.

  And they don't use toilet paper so instead wash their butts in the sink ala bidet.

I always did think toilet paper was a funny custom. If I get poop on my hands, I don't wipe at them with a piece of paper, I get them wet and scrub them down with hot water and soap! 




 Yes, it does, but I think we all eat things that aren't chock full of vitamins from time to time. 




 Oh, it's nothing. I award myself one fake internet point every time I get a book right on the first shot, so I'm motivated! 





















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 Been there, done that. Also: Kim Peek, inspiration for Rain Man, was *not autistic*, and do people ever listen when you say that? No, no they do not. 




 Spelling and writing are more "crystallized" than speech and take longer to change. Also, our orthography is something we are explicitly taught long after we have learned to speak.

Finally, the question you need to ask is "considered right by whom and in what context?"  Many words are roundly condemned despite being in common usage for a very long time. Consider "ain't" or the "aks" pronunciation of "ask". There is no official body to say "this is right, this is wrong". Instead, right and wrong are largely considered on the grounds of what wealthy, educated people consider to be right and wrong... which, unsurprisingly, overlaps strongly with how they perceive themselves as speaking and writing. 




 Iris is pretty light skinned. Her children, especially if she marries a white guy, could easily come out looking lighter than she is. And if they continue the trend, there's no reason her grandchildren couldn't look white. And if they look white and identify as white, they effectively *are* white, race being a social construct and not any sort of science. Quite a lot of people who consider themselves white in America are walking around with black ancestors, they just don't know it. (Or they do know it and don't consider it terribly relevant, because unlike in Jim Crow days "one drop" is just not that important to us.)

At any rate, Eobard is ~16 generations removed from Eddie, not 1 or 2. (Going by the wiki, which says he's from the 25th century, and assuming 25 years between generations. That's the rule used for gathering demographic data.) 




 What. 




 It was so futuristic he had no idea where to start.  




 It's tragic what's happened to Grimm. 




 He may have actually found bodies, but it's claimed he specifically found the bodies of Major's two dead kids, so either way he's definitely using these people as a cover-up. 




 On the one hand, clever way to move those missing kids! Well, until people notice that kids are *still going missing*, which they *will*, and then it's just going to scream "cover-up".

One question: How'd he place the bodies there fast enough to be "discovered" without being seen? 




 I'm faster than your av-er-age bear. 




 Yes, it was definitely one of his grayer moments. His Maquis opponent was right on the money, too - the Federation *does* "assimilate people and they don't even know it". They just wake up one day, drinking the root beer. But Sisko is so deep in root beer that he can't see that this might be a problem, ethically speaking. 




 Eobard went back in time specifically to fight the Flash in, I guess, 2024. He's really from the 25th century, according to the wiki. 












































 Oh, yeah, because *that* wouldn't tip him off. 




 So maybe The Flash killed his mom. Or maybe a third speedster did it. Or maybe his dad did it, and he made it up, and coincidentally it looks like the marks left by The Flash. Or maybe....

"It was a speedster" is not going to clear things up without a name to attach to the speedster. 




 It's part of his costume. Because he doesn't believe - hey, that's how Iris figured it out! Barry didn't believe strongly enough and broke the fiction field. 




 If we don't believe that people in costume are unrecognizable, all secret identity plots fall apart. That not only takes down a great number of superheroes, but also huge swaths of opera, Shakespeare, and the occasional fairy tale.

I'm not willing to destroy Western culture for the sake of Iris West. 




 But lots of people work with Eddie, Joe, Barry, and Cisco - namely, *the entire station*, and also the pizza guy and the janitors if we're using the "dropping stuff off = working with you" definition. 




 Not as valuable a hostage as Iris, who was *standing right there*.

Though point 1 makes sense. 




 Wait, does she know that he's buddies with all of Barry's friends? (And hey - doesn't Barry have any pre-lightning friends who *aren't* Iris?) 




 Hm. Shouldn't that put him at a higher risk of cancer? 




 Why would he bother to save Eddie - who has been dead for centuries, naturally - if Eddie isn't in a direct line of descent? 




 Usually run through the schools, which lately have become paranoid about letting unrelated adults in. 




 And evidently, if you DO follow comics you shouldn't worry either, because they don't make any sense. 




 This sub will never give Iris credit for anything. She could save the world and they'd just bitch that she was a whiny Mary Sue. (Admittedly, if she DID save the world that'd give some real credence to the Mary Sue argument.) 




 It must be a relief after having to play Wells for a decade and a half. 




 Maybe Iris suffers from voiceblindness.

http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128412201 




 I eventually googled it. Short answer? He's crazy. Long answer? He's *really* crazy, and also a bit of a sociopath (in the informal TV definition). 




 So, again, Eobard could've just strolled right through, so long as he didn't vibrate or run. 




 Okay, so why did Barry *run* into the thing to test it? Why not just stroll up and press his hand against it? 




 If time travel exists in the future, it exists now. People who aren't time travelers simply aren't able to use it. 




 The Central City Bocce Club. 




 That's a big assumption to make considering that about 40 - 50% of marriages in the US eventually end in divorce.

Even if it does shake out that way, that doesn't mean that Eobard couldn't exist. Eddie could cheat. Iris could die young, causing Eddie to remarry without divorce. Eddie could donate sperm to a friend or stranger (who happens to also be one of Eobard's ~65,500 ancestors alive today). They could have fertility issues combined with a wacky mixup at the clinic. They and Barry could form a stable poly relationship.

Lots of options! 




 Yes, and? We're talking *hundreds of years*. One drop is just not that strong. 




 Then why did they let Barry careen into it like a nitwit? 




 So... wait. Cisco made a forcefield that stops people when they're speedstering, but not when they're moving at a normal pace? What the hell is the point? Surely he realized that Barry and Eobard can walk like normal people when they choose.

Also, them in the vault: Look at the cool costume! Check out that byline! Yeah, glad to see you guys have your priorities in order.

Edit: AND WHY TELL IRIS TO GO HOME? RF knows where she lives! Tell her to go to a hotel! 



























































 It is? Which rule is that? Can I see the book you got that from? Who wrote it? 




 Same reason he needs to actually hold a tricorder rather than using holographic tricorder eyes. 




 Well, that's you. I don't really care about the weird aliens or the technobabble unless the *people* have a compelling story. If it's all about aliens and technobabble, why have a constant cast? Why not just do stories like on Outer Limits or Twilight Zone? 





























 They were toxic, yes, but the one does not preclude the other. They took child abuse to a pretty heavy level.

Also, how many "things" did they do? Did they go on an outing every weekend, or one every year? They certainly were with Harry more often than not.  




 Aaaaah, could it be one of the Lisa, Bill, and Jed mysteries by Peggy Parish?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Parish#Liza.2C_Bill_.26_Jed_mysteries 







































 Well, do Trills have a, um, non physical afterlife? 




 And one on Dropbox or something. Seriously, guys, get it together! 




  But he's also an antisocial square, devoted to a conception of personal honor that he hasn't realized is just set dressing for a culture of political thuggery that has repeatedly spurned and assaulted him....

Putting aside your main question, I want to take a second to defend Worf here. 

I think Worf really *does* realize as an adult that Klingons do not all match up to the ideal he formed in his head as a child. The trouble is that his personality was formed as an adopted Klingon child living on a Federation colony. He didn't fit in, and he didn't fit in with Klingons, and like any child he rather simplistically decided that if he could just live up to everybody's ideals, he could fit in with everybody instead of his actual situation, which was fitting in with nobody at all. 

So he threw himself into being Worf, son of Mogh, SUPERKLINGON while simultaneously trying to be Worf Rozhenko, FEDERATION. The end result is, well, Worf the grown-up, whose idea of meshing the best of both cultures led him to be quite a serious individual. And an epic buzzkill. Even when he grew old enough and knowledgeable enough to realize that Klingon society isn't all honorable all the time (and that humans don't all live up to their vaunted ideals either, nor does any other species in the Federation or out of it), he'd put too much effort into this to easily ditch it and become somebody a little less uptight.

This is still probably a bit healthier than the path we see for other Klingons (or part-Klingons) raised primarily by humans, such as B'Elanna's approach of simply rejecting everything she perceived as "Klingon" in her personality or Alexander deciding to just randomly sign up on a Klingon ship despite being really *really* underqualified. 

Now, with that said, I can see why Worf and Jadzia would take up with each other, and even why their relationship works on a storytelling level. From Worf's perspective, Jadzia is somebody who can accept him for who he is, both Klingon and Federation. She enjoys Klingon culture on more than a superficial level, and she also appreciates Federation ideals. They have a realistic level of culture clash. I don't know that their relationship would have really lasted all that much longer if she hadn't been killed, but it's not all that uncommon for people to enter a marriage and figure out three or four years down the line that they screwed that one up, should've remained friends. Not every long-term relationship on TV has to really be forever. That's what's really unrealistic.

(Alternatively, they could have continued to try to adapt and make it work, and had they gone that route it probably would have lasted if she hadn't been killed.)

The one thing I find really unrealistic is that despite them both having been married before, neither had the common sense of a gnat. Before getting married, you should discuss all major issues like "what about vacations" and "childrearing practices?" and "budget!" (not sure if this is an issue for starfleet, but I never really believed they have no money) and, oh yeah, "what about the afterlife, are we both going to the same place or what?" 




 Well, it's in the public domain, isn't it? 




 That's a survivorship fallacy if I ever saw one. You look at the few ones we remember decades later and take them as representative. 

Additionally, who's to say that they'll last another few decades? They certainly might - once something has been in print 50 years, it'll probably be in print another 50 - but sometimes things do fall off the cultural radar. For example, although kids today certainly do know about Michael Jackson, do they know about MASH? (Source: Have two young nieces, had to endure months of Michael Jackson worship. They've since moved on to Katy Perry, which isn't really any better.) 




 It's psychosomatic. 




 Has he ever been punched before? 




 "Compensate!"

Uh, yeah, I hadn't thought of that. Good thing we have you to give the orders around here. 




 He gets along great with Janeway too. It's apparently only *Sisko* he can't stand, though I doubt Ben's crying himself to sleep over it. 




 That whole episode fixed on a ridiculous misunderstanding of evolution, but then, does anybody on ST understand evolution ever?

There was the one where Worf's (adopted) brother was trying to save that species and Picard was initially all "can't, prime directive" about it. Yes, I'm sure an uncontaminated culture will be a *huge help* when they're all *dead*! (And any other episode which runs along those lines can equally go rot.) 




 I thought nobody died, they all managed to evacuated in time. Plus, it wasn't made uninhabitable, just uninhabitable *to humans*, meaning that they were able to swap with the Cardassians. In the long run, probably made both colonies safer as they were effectively out of the war, couldn't be invaded. (Well, except by the Jem Hadar, I suppose. Or by some other Federation species that wasn't human. Or by some other species entirely. And I guess there's always the Borg, but you know what I mean.) 




 Boredom. Isn't that always his motivation? 




  I agree with a lot of what you are saying, but remember that the Federation does not equate to Earth and humans only. The Vulcans are part of the Federation. 

As are the Andorians, aren't they? And now the Bajorans. A Vulcan (or Andorian, or Bajoran) colony would be one set up by those governments either pre-Federation (prior to joining the Federation for the Bajorans) or that is limited largely or entirely to those species. (Which sets up an interesting question. Can or will the Federation charter a colony that is set up to be just one species?) 




 In Deep Space Nine, during the baseball episode, we find out that the Captain's Vulcan nemesis heads an all-Vulcan ship. An all-Vulcan ship in Starfleet. In Enterprise and Voyager, viewpoint Vulcans give us an idea of how frustrating it can be to be a Vulcan surrounded by non-Vulcans.

It seems plausible to me that some species, such as humans, are more willing to be part of a mixed crew than others, such as Vulcans. Since humans aren't likely to be interested in watching a show that's 100% non-human, we see the human-dominated ships, with the human captains. There is no guarantee that this is the majority of all captains, though. 

Additionally, as much as it's possible for some species to have an easier time living with others than other species, it seems likely that some are simply more interested in space exploration for its own sake. This can be backed up by looking at the stats. The Vulcans have been flitting around the galaxy since 900 BCE, the Bajorans since the 1600s (at sublight speeds), the Klingons sometime between the 20th and 21st centuries, the Andorians since at least the 20th century. Yet the galaxy is not full up on Vulcan (pre-Federation) and Bajoran and Klingon and Andorian colonies. There are still plenty of worlds for the Federation to site colonies on. 





























 It's not a fish tank, it's a self-contained ecosystem. So long as light goes in to keep the plants growing, it just keeps going indefinitely. 




 The Woman in the Wall 




 Except many people don't have the freedom to live in an area without an HOA, because they need to live in a certain area and all neighborhoods in that area have HOAs. 




 I live on Staten Island. No HOAs. Our sidewalks are maintained, we have playgrounds and parks, garbage and recycling is paid by taxes, the garbage truck picks up large items once a week (Mondays, same day as recycling, Thursday is just for regular trash), we have community yard sales and parties and all organized by the community frequently throughout the summer, and our block has an annual block party.

HOAs are not needed for quality of life. 




 Some of us are lucky enough to live in parts of the country without them. 




 Ooooh, with the Powerpuff Girls? 




 That's the same argument that's been used to bar selling homes to blacks/Jews. 




 Because in some areas, if you want to buy a home, you pretty much are stuck with one under an HOA. And if you already are signed up for a job in that area, you can't just say "screw it, I'll commute in from Maine instead" (or wherever). 




 In some areas, it's pretty much impossible to buy a house that's not under a HOA. Rather than blaming the victims, why not *rein in the HOAs*? 




 Some people with disabilities really can't wait for a toilet. They are incapable of holding it in, or holding it in will give them a huge bladder infection.

If you have a choice, it's better not to use the disabled toilet. You definitely shouldn't use that one if you think you're going to be there a while.  




 Person first language.

Okay, I get the reasoning. Sorta. I think it's really *weird*, but I get the reasoning, and more than that, I understand that a lot of people think it's always the best and most polite way to talk about PWDs. That's what they've been told, that's what they believe.

Me- and I'm not alone in this - I find it stigmatizing. You don't call somebody "A person with Asian-ness" or "A woman who happens to be beautiful" or "A man who has homosexuality". No, that sort of workaround is restricted to disabilities. 

I also think it's weird and insulting that something that is a huge and important part of who I am, more important than my gender (and people can't get through three sentences without labeling you as male or female!), should be treated like it's minor and unimportant in the name of  being "polite".

But because I am polite and have good manners, I'm not going to jump all over people who use person-first language. They mean well.

Now, is it asking so much to want them to show me the same basic respect? If somebody says that they are "an autistic individual" or "a blind dude" or "a Deaf woman" and the very first words out of your mouth are "I think you mean *person with autism*" (or whatever), you are *doing it wrong*. If they had meant that, they would have said that, and you are being *so* rude and disrespectful.

Don't do that. Don't be a jerk. Also: if you know for certain that somebody prefers this usage over that one, try to use that one! But definitely don't "correct" them. 




 Though it's important to remember that many individuals with various disabilities *loathe and detest* person first language. I, for one, find it overly stigmatizing. Nobody speaks in a funny way, after all, when referring to positive or neutral traits. 

It's not God's gift to human discourse. 




 There's a diversity of opinions on the subject, as you might expect.

Two things to consider:

1. It is possible - I don't know this boy (I assume he's a real kid, not a character?) - that what's making his life difficult is not the autism per se but the disabling attitudes of society. (When you hang around with entirely the wrong crowd, phrases like "the disabling attitudes of society" come trippingly on the tongue as easily as "hi, how are you!")

2. The real concern about a cure is not that a cure might be available, but that it might not be *optional* - or that at *best*, it would only be optional *to the parents* and the autistic individual themselves wouldn't get a say, being cured (or not) before they can make their own medical decisions. 




 Kind people, when told "stop doing this", don't whine about it. They just *stop doing it*. 




  I've been told by DOCTORS that I don't "look autistic".

What do they think autism looks like? 




 Interestingly, the majority of main Ferengi cast members were played by Jews. So I guess the stereotyping is okay...? 




 Lawns are convenient places to feed your pet goat. 




 And where you can't hang up a clothesline, like, ever. FFS, HOA's are freaking unAmerican. Whatever happened to freedom? 




 Well, if they'd *scanned* all those books into a database by now, they'd be safe. 




 Not to be all PETA about it, but I bet the boars aren't sobbing. 









 Which is why it's such a silly choice for lawns in arid areas. 














 But also assholes. I mean, Hermione is a spiteful, vindictive *bitch*. What she did to Marietta was really unjust, and the birds? OMG the birds.

Not that she wasn't provoked that time by the fact that Ron was being a jerk, just like he was back in third year. Or fourth year, for that matter. Actually, he had his little moments fifth year as well, as I recall.... 




 McGonnagal had a muggle father. Her mother and all the children being magical caused no end of family strife. She may not have been an unbiased source. 




 Nobody else was with him for ~3,500 consecutive days. 




 Wow. That... actually makes sense. 

I mean, I think it's more likely that Petunia was just a narcissist at heart and that she probably *had* been overlooked and ignored in favor of her sister (familial dysfunction is frequently inherited), but both things can be true. 









 During a drought??? 




 HOAs oughta be outlawed, or at least their powers *severely* limited. 



























































 No, it was called "the orient" because Asia is to the east of Europe, and orient in that sense means east.

At one time it was common for maps to be made with east at the top, one reason that "to orient" means "to find a direction", but that's not relevant. 




 Maybe next time you could use do not link.

http://www.donotlink.com/

Why give them increased visibility and clicks? 




 That man certainly has a bad case of stripes. Luckily, as I learned from the book of the same name, he can cure that condition by being true to himself rather than trying to fit in with the majority or worrying that his preferences will be considered "weird". 




 H. M. Hoover is an underrated author. 




 Nope, NYC. And the first grade teacher was Brooklyn-Italian. The logic was that it counts as a vowel in pairs like aw or ow. 




  
 
 
 
 But if we're arbitrarily categorizing letters, can we at least exclude y from the vowel category? I never really thought of it as a vowel letter anyways. 

You certainly may, but other people aren't likely to go along with it.

Interestingly, when I was in first grade I was explicitly taught "and sometimes y *and w*", which apparently nobody else ever was taught.  












































 There was also that one where they met the evolved dinosaurs that fled Earth.

Okay, theoretically possible... but there's *no way* that the Holodeck could predict the one and only "evolutionary path" for them to have, uh, taken.  




 Here's the thing to remember: The writers weren't/aren't any smarter than you are, and they think the viewer is damn stupid. If it's making your brain hurt, just assume they didn't understand it. 




 Sorry I couldn't save you from that. 




 Beast, Donna Jo Napoli 




 You don't really want to watch it. 




 I'll believe it when I see it. 




 Let's back up. You said, and I quote:

 Ask the majority of English speakers how many vowels English has, and they'll say 5. Just because they never took a linguistics course doesn't mean they're not wrong. 

As near as I can figure, you're saying that the *mainstream definition* - the one used by normal people who aren't speaking in academic or linguistic terms - is *wrong*, and those people who speak casually are simply *wrong*. It's not that they're using a different definition of the word (one that runs "a vowel is a member of the category of letters 'a-e-i-o-u-and-sometimes-y', every syllable has at least one vowel"), they're just wrong.

Which is rather akin to saying "Tomatoes and bell peppers and cucumbers aren't vegetables, they're fruits" and getting pissy when people say that in normal parlance, they're culinary vegetables.

Also, not sure where you're getting "English has 11 vowels" from. Different dialects surely differ. Is this some sort of average, or...? 




 What were you doing, regenerating? 




 I'd watch that. 




 Worf would *have* to be grieving to make jokes that bad. 




 Warp drive is sci-fi handwavium to explain away relativity precisely so nobody has to worry about that sort of thing. 




 Just a major hub. All the Borg get destroyed (more or less) in one of the novels. 




 Wait, wait, wait. You're saying that there is only one correct definition of "vowel", and that's not the one in common parlance?

Where did you get your degree again? 




 Yes. Except in the Mirror Universe, where I think she crowns herself empress...? 




 Well, Seven *and* all the knowledge she brought, but still, she still could've shown up sooner in Seven's human lifetime. 




 I always figured that she got to Earth, sat down, and said "That's it. Nobody's going to EVER drag me off-planet again!" 




 Its not well-enough written to be visionary. To be visionary, it has to be *consistent* and *believable*. The currency situation on Star Trek is neither, even within the episodes from a single series. 




 DS9 didn't have credits, and latinum was used by the Ferengi and other non-Federation (or, at least, non-human) species.

Which sorta works, until you ask "but... uh... how on earth were the humans getting root beer out of Quark?" I mean, they had to have been compensating him somehow!

It may be possible for a complex society such as the Federation to operate without any form of money. It is not possible for the Federation *as written* to do that, no matter how many times they tried to shoehorn "no money in the future!" into the script.

Also, I get that they're post-scarcity, but post-scarcity doesn't mean that everything is available to everybody. If you want to eat at Sisko's Creole Kitchen, and so does everybody else, there has to be some way to determine who gets a seat and who has to wait. Post scarcity means that everybody gets food, but it doesn't mean that everybody gets Syrup of Squill during the shortage. Everybody gets a roof over their heads, but they don't all get 1,000 sq ft of prime waterfront views right in the heart of the most fashionable neighborhood. Everybody gets an education and health care, they don't all get the best teacher and doctor... and there has got to be some way to allocate who gets the most desirable things and who gets the merely functional ones. If they're not using "money" as this system, then they've done a darn poor job of explaining what they ARE using instead. 




 She was playing it cool, secretly taking pics so she could post them later all "The Flash showed up, and I acted like an adult instead of badgering him for his autograph, this is the coolest city ever!!!!" 




  How do you know whats a vowel and a consonant if you ignore the sounds?

"A vowel is the letters a-e-i-o-u-and-sometimes-y"

 I thought that for whatever reason, letters were arbitrarily divided into these categories. 

That is exactly what most people think. 




 But not HIV, chlamydia, syphillis.... 




 I've got a copy of it on my bedside table right now. 




 And what if your daughter gets raped? 




 Because they might be raped.

Because when they get older, they'll probably, at some point, choose to have sex, and it's better to already be vaccinated at that point.

Because why not? 




 A lot of girls just get vaccinated when it's due, not because they made the choice but because their parents did. 




 Heroes of the Valley, Stroud. 




 You do that :)

Though I won't hold it against you if you forget! 




 Highly recommend everybody watch that video, as it's pretty awesome. 




 Bats and dolphins can do that via echolocation. Neither of those species is blind, of course, but they could be and they'd still be able to navigate pretty well. 




 Pretty much. His super power is "not being blind". If anything, his "sight" (echolocation and just generally extremely good hearing, sensitivity to temperature, a terrific sense of smell... I think....) is better than most people's. 




 Oh, good, I was worried I'd entered lecture mode and just annoyed the crap out of you. (I'm working on not doing that.)

And yes, by all means you should go to the doctor you're comfortable with. Besides, taking up space in a clinic if you don't *need* to is unfair to the people who don't have a choice as to which doctor to visit. It's not first world problems, it's... compassion for people who hate waiting!

I have my fingers metaphorically crossed for a good test result.

 So it's hard to push own the thoughts that I'm already unlucky so of course I'll get cancer. 

Well, bad things come in threes. Anxiety attacks are 1, ovarian failure is 2, and losing your insurance a while back after having that jerky ex is definitely 3 - so maybe you're safe :) 




 I know the feeling. It's just looming over you, like Schrodinger's STD. But you know of course that once it's over, at least you'll know. It'll all be hunky-dory, or it won't, but at least you'll *know*.

Ugh on taking a whole day off of work. Maybe a clinic in your area has weekend hours? 




 Exactly which STDs do you think this vaccine prevents OTHER THAN HPV? 




 Well, I suppose so? The elder kiddo got hers done recently, we didn't even say what it was for, just "Look, at 11 you're due for two shots, so let's get 'em done and on the way home we'll grab a doughnut." 




 Sometimes STDs aren't a matter of being responsible, but just of bad luck. What if you get raped, say, or you're in a monogamous long-term relationship but don't realize your partner is cheating on you? 




 Religious conservatives, mostly. They think that if you get your kid a vaccine, or teach them about condoms, then they'll just go out and screw like bunnies. If you keep them utterly ignorant and unprotected, though, they'll stay home and knit. Or something. 




 *hugs*

I know it's scary, but you should go anyway to get checked out at Planned Parenthood or someplace. 




 Don't worry about that. Even Terry Pratchett got that one wrong - and that is *not* something I have cause to say very often. 




 Eobard doesn't consistently have his speed back, making operations based on speed dubious at best, and this is the first rule because moving the body is suspicious behavior. You dig up the body, leaving evidence that *something* was left there. You transport it great distances - even at superspeed, somebody might notice something, and when Barry gets news that "The Flash" was seen somewhere he *knows* he wasn't, he's going to know something's up. 

Trying to hide the evidence carries the risk of leaving more evidence around.  




 That's a fascinating question. On your next watch-through (if you're here, I take it as given that you intend to watch the series a second time!), put on the audio description and find out. Then you can report back if you're so inclined. 




 And for reference for people who have never heard of Robert Moses, let me say this: despite being dead for the past 34 years, there are people who *still* actively curse his name, who spit it out only to state how much they hate him and what he did to the city.

I just headed to /r/nyc and searched up "Robert Moses" and a rough tabulation of comments that are effectively "Fuck him" is enlightening, to say the least. 




 HIS heart? What about OUR hearts?  




 Maybe he wasn't really that guy. 




 It's called a *loveseat*. 




 Turn too many people into zombies, though, and you start running into supply issues. He wants clients, not  a horde. 




 *Really* awful. Continuous time in solitary is roundly condemned as inhumane, and it does terrible things to the mind. Plus, they don't even have any toilets in there, or books, or TV, or ANYthing. There is not even any pretense of rehabilitating them so that the least criminal of them could ever rejoin society. 




 Yes, it seems odd to me that in a show with a female protagonist, we rarely see either of the other two female characters. 




 Okay, the show is wrong. Ring Around the Rosie is NOT based upon the Black Death. That little story didn't show up until some time *after* the first appearance of the song, which itself didn't show up until a couple of hundred years *after* the Black Death - and, as it's an oral tradition, you should be unsurprised by the fact that its first appearance sounded nothing like the most common iteration today. No ashes or falling down.

 He's certainly getting paid for his show. 




 He was right, though. That video *is* pretty damning. 




 Yeah, how *did* this guy know where Barry lives? 







































 Or if you just don't loathe her. Seriously, the Iris whining is worse here than on the show! 




 Stupidity? Joe's a control freak? Needless plot drama? 




 You definitely have them mixed. Her knowledge was never an issue, Joe's investigation was. 




  I think it's even worse for female characters.

Noticed that, have you? 




 And that cost would be 100% the same if Iris was hurt due to her ignorance - or with no regard to whether she knew or not.

Let's look at the people who know his secret identity. We've got one, two, three, *four* supervillains. Do you really think any of them would hold off on Iris because "after all, she has no clue"? She's *already* been threatened by two supervillains and had somebody she worked with killed, and this despite her ignorance.

Barry woke up and told two virtual strangers (Caitlin and Cisco may have known him for several months, but as he was in a coma he certainly didn't know them) before telling his best friend/foster sister/love interest. That is *cold*. 




 Why does Eddie believe Eobard, though? I mean, by his shocked look he does, but not only can any doofus mock up a fake newspage but clearly, if Eddie is Eobard's ancestor, he gets *a* girl. And Eobard is a murderer. Who knows how he blows off steam? Maybe casual emotional cruelty is to him what checkers is to normal people. 




 This is a guy who poked brains at a decaying zombie while crouching above her. I watched that and *cringed*. Surely a sensible person would have laid on their stomach and scooted? 




 Geez, is this supposed to make sense? And they say soap operas have convoluted plots! 




  Like she said she could help if she had known, but trying to help the Flash is the easiest way to get kidnapped or killed.

Then she could have *known that* and known *not* to get involved.

 I mean if I was a superhero I definitely wouldn't tell people about my identity because knowing automatically puts them in danger.

It does not. Supervillains knowing puts your loved ones in danger. Your loved ones knowing does nothing of  the sort. That's a silly conceit that needs to die.  




 If Iris had laughed it off, they'd be pissed. If Iris had kept it to herself and said "I'm sure it's important to him, he had a good reason for not telling me", they'd be pissed. If Iris hadn't figured it out after that spark, they'd be pissed. If Iris had really known all the time... well, you get the picture.

Rightly or wrongly, this sub's hatred for Iris goes well beyond "she has bad writing" at this point. 




 Why? 




 Well, if it's any consolation, plenty of autistics are awful at math and computing, not big on gaming of any sort, and/or are extroverts. I have no data on how many autistics have lots and lots of friends in high school. 




 They certainly are more qualified to speak for "everyone else on the spectrum" than you are.

However, I would really like to see a statistic that "most" autistics are "low-functioning" (or however you're trying to phrase it). An actual citation, that is. 




 Yes, actually, it's quite common among autistics.

http://www.autism.com/symptoms_toe_walking

But it's not *universal* - and honestly, out of his scare list, it's definitely the least harmful. Might shorten the tendons, I suppose. 




 The previous system wasn't really working. You'd hear of kids "moving" from one diagnosis to another - well, under the diagnostic criteria, that should not have happened. I'm not saying this system is better, time will answer that, but the DSM-IV system was seriously flawed. 




 If you fit the diagnostic criteria for autism, then you ARE autistic. If you have received an autism diagnosis, but don't fit it, then probably this is because you need the services anyway but whatever your real diagnosis is *won't get you the help you need* and an autism diagnosis will. People do not get their children diagnosed - much less themselves diagnosed - for funzies. 




 The rise in cancer has nothing to do with "our bodies trying to adapt to how the world has changed" and everything to do with greater longitivity and better screening. If you don't die of cholera, war, childbirth, polio, SIDS, or the plague, then you'll probably live long enough to die of cancer. And if the doctors are good enough to prevent all those other deaths, they'll probably see that you have cancer sometime before you die of it. 




 Many older autistics were never diagnosed. Others may have been diagnosed (either as children or adults) but simply don't disclose that information to everybody. Still others who need more support did receive a diagnosis and were institutionalized, meaning the odds of people outside their family meeting them are slim.

At least one study has shown that when you take adults and use current screening methods, you find the same rate of autism as you do in children.

For the record, my grandfather was autistic. My mother has a second cousin who was almost certainly autistic. I strongly suspect both parents, both grandmothers, and my maternal uncle are part of the "broader autistic phenotype". I have several friends who are older than 30 who are autistic - and I only met about *half* of them on autistic-specific fora. But if you don't know what you're looking for, and you also don't ask, then you'll never know. 




 It'd be very strange for a child to be diagnosed as autistic for pointing given that it is *lack of pointing* that is typically associated with autism.

These are the actual diagnostic criteria for autism, as distinct from the ones you made up in your head: http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html

Note that examples are "illustrative, not exhaustive" and that it is not necessary for a person to hit every single note to obtain a diagnosis, and it is possible to obtain a diagnosis even if it is "by history", that is, not something they currently do. 




 Just because a person may appear to be "less autistic" than another person, that doesn't mean they don't "really need help". 




 Sorta. Asperger's only became a diagnosis with the DSM-IV. Prior to that, it wasn't listed as a disorder and many people who would now be diagnosed as autistic didn't receive any diagnosis at all. 




 Twenty years ago, inclusion was not as popular as it is today, and disabled children were more likely to be segregated. 




 Recent studies have shown that genes for intelligence are linked to genes for autism: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150310105232.htm

And when you give IQ tests that aren't biased towards verbal skills, autistics do as well as NTs: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hidden-potential-of-autistic-kids/ (I had a better link at once point, but that was two computers ago)

So your therapist suggesting this has nothing to do with your intelligence, real or perceived. 

Additionally, many autistics have had healthy relationships and professional success. Of course, you can show every possible trait for autism, and if it's not negatively affecting your ability to work, go to school, or generally live your life you won't qualify for a diagnosis. Still, I assume that you had *some* problem that led you to a therapist. It wasn't unreasonable for him to try to figure out what it was. 




 Not all autistics engage in scripted speech or echolalia. Not all autistics are "obsessed with routine". Not all autistics toe walk. Not all autistics self-injure. (Actually, only 10 - 15% of autistics self-injure.) 




 Well, no argument here on the "educational environment" front, but I disagree that giving a clear label of "autistic" is "segregating an entire portion of humanity". I think it's no different from people being labelled as gay or left-handed. (But then, I'm a big fan of the social model of disability.) 




 We've known for a long time that autistics usually have family members with autistic traits, frequently people who merit a diagnosis themselves. And we also know that if you take the adult population and use current diagnostic criteria, you get the same percentage of autistics as you do in the youth population. I think it is unlikely that prenatal vitamins have anything to do with it. 




 You're talking out your ass. My grandfather was autistic. He absolutely fit "today's criteria". If you're going to use the 1:68 statistic, then you have to include the *entire* spectrum - not just those who are most obviously autistic. Most children getting diagnosed today would not have qualified for a diagnosis under the DSM-III. 




 Most young autistics don't bang their heads against walls. Not chronically, anyway. 




 Wait. You think it's the *having a diagnosis* that keeps autistics from being employed? It's not the autism, it's the diagnosis? 




  If I were growing up today, I'd have had the ASD label slapped on me as soon as I entered public school. Instead, I grew up 30 years ago, when my "uniqueness" was not just tolerated, but appreciated and nurtured by my teachers and parents. Did I have problems? Yes. Did I grow up into a successful, happy adult? Also yes.

You're lucky. I mean, you're *really* lucky. There are many more people who grew up the same time as you, and *because* they had no official label they did not have their uniqueness tolerated at all, much less nurtured. They got labels, all right - "stupid" and "bad" and "lazy" and "weird". Autism is a better label any day of the week. 




 You are way off base. Autism has a number of components. Trouble with social skills is only a small one (and, anecdotally, many autistics have no trouble at all socializing *with other autistics*, only with NTs). Even if you could induce the social symptoms, you can't induce most of the comorbidities - sensory processing disorder, dyspraxia, auditory processing disorder, faceblindness.... I'm just listing things off the top of my head, of course. 




 Yes, and also the average age of the paternal grandfather - that is, men who are older when they father children are more likely to have autistic grandchildren. To my knowledge, the jury's still out on whether this is something changing about the sperm or simply because people with autistic traits tend to be older than their NT peers when they start their families. But I haven't obsessively followed this stuff in a few years. 




 You're quite mistaken. The CHAT (checklist for autism in toddlers) has as a starred entry *not* pointing. Indeed, not pointing at things is one of the two classic hallmarks of autism, along with lack of eye contact.

http://www.autism.org.uk/working-with/health/screening-and-diagnosis/checklist-for-autism-in-toddlers-chat.aspx 




 Yes, there was. I don't have the original source to hand, but I do have a report in the popular press: http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AutismNews/autism-epidemic-challenged-uk-study/story?id=13518453 




 Pretty much. The diagnostic standards have dramatically changed in two ways.

First, they've changed to encompass the idea of an autism "spectrum". Many of the kids getting diagnosed today (and the adults as well!) would not/did not get a diagnosis 30 years ago simply because they could speak. They got a diagnosis of ADD or they got no diagnosis at all.

Secondly, even for those "low functioning" autistics, it is much easier to get a diagnosis. It used to be the case that the default diagnosis was *childhood schizophrenia*, that if you didn't hit enough criteria, that's the label you got. And if you're about to say that the two are nothing alike - you're right! But that's how it shook out. Other autistics were misdiagnosed as mentally retarded, which is kinda a catchall.

Additionally, reporting was half-assed back in the day. When the diagnoses started going up, mandatory reporting was improved. Then people realized how much more common it was than they had thought, and that made them look for it harder. It's a little feedback loop at this point in the story. 




 Do you know what her IEP entailed? They generally don't consist of "dumbing things down". For example, many people have IEPs that allow them unlimited time on tests. Evidence shows that for people who do not need those IEPs, unlimited time offers them no advantage. That's not "dumbing down", that's leveling the playing field. Some people have difficulty concentrating in crowded lecture halls and need smaller classes. Well, that might make working in an ER impossible, but there's no reason they couldn't be a pediatric nurse at a small practice or something. 




 You are incorrect. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of autism in adults is the same as in children, once you bring adults in to be diagnosed.

I once made a long comment about this, and lucky for me I saved it to my computer because now I can't find the original. Just gonna c+p it here for you:

Okay, now people have been screaming about the rising diagnosis rates for autism since the mid-90s. They say that increased awareness cannot possibly account for all the increase. I submit that it certainly can and probably does for several reasons.

First, starting with the publication of the DSM-IV in the early 90s the diagnostic criteria for autism changed significantly. It became much easier to obtain. Previously, if you did not perfectly match the criteria you got a diagnosis of the catch-all "mental retardation" or even of "childhood schizophrenia" - and if you're about to say that autism is nothing like schizophrenia, don't bother, I know. But that's how the diagnosis was back then. Since it was easier to get a diagnosis of autism, naturally, diagnoses went up. (And every time I say "diagnoses went up", remember that this means awareness went up as well.)

Secondly, at that same time, "asperger's" as entered into the DSM, and the whole concept of an autistic spectrum emerged. Plenty of children who would have received no diagnosis at all prior to this, or who would've been diagnosed as ADD or as OCD were now obtaining diagnoses such as Asperger's, HFA, or PDD-NOS. (This actually happened to me. My parents dragged me around to doctors for years trying to get me diagnosed (my mother had apparently worked with autistic students for a while, and they'd read some books by Temple Grandin), but back in the day you basically couldn't get diagnosed as autistic if you could speak, especially if you were bright and/or female. When I got diagnosed as an adult I was told it was really pretty obvious. Trust me, I don't act more autistic now than I did as a kid!) Of course, the thing to take away from this is that diagnoses went up.

Thirdly, prior to the 90s, reporting of autism was sporadic at best. Many states made no reports of cases of autism, or only half-hearted ones. But as awareness continued to rise, more and more states started making better and better reports, allowing us to get a better grasp of new cases being diagnosed. And this, of course, in and of itself led to increased awareness.

Increased awareness is, of course, the fourth piece of the puzzle, the one all the others lead to. Doctors, as we know, are told "when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras". Sound advice in most situations - if it looks like a cold, it probably IS a cold. But the problem comes when what you think is a zebra is really a horse.

Prior to the DSM-IV, doctors were told that the autism risk was something like 1 in 10,000. And parents didn't really hear about it at all, or if they did they thought of "Rain Man", and if their kid didn't match that profile perfectly (given that Kim Peek, the inspiration for the character, wasn't autistic they shouldn't expect that), assumed that the term "autistic" didn't apply to their child and didn't ask doctors to look into it. (I am certain that if I had been given the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers as a toddler I would have been diagnosed much sooner. I would have failed it at 18 months. Heck, I would have failed it at 8 years, and that's not an exaggeration. Now it's standard, but it wasn't when I was a child.) Because the doctors parents went to assumed it was rare, they didn't look for it, and so they failed to diagnose it. But as awareness continued to rise, doctors were more and more likely to look for autism, and thus more and more likely to diagnose it. And when the alarmist bells started to ring about how autism is "increasing", doctors and parents BOTH started to look for it a LOT more.

Now, of course, this all doesn't show that incidence is the same as it has always been, simply that incidence could be the same as it has always been. Anecdotally, though, I will say that it is a very common story among adult autistics to be diagnosed only after a child in the family is diagnosed. Sometime during the process they start to realize that everything that applies to this kid also applies to them, and then they get diagnosed. Not so anecdotally, at least one study has shown that the rate in adults is really no different from the rate in children: http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AutismNews/autism-epidemic-challenged-uk-study/story?id=13518453 (I've seen other sources, but it's been a while since I avidly kept up on autism news).

Another note: Many people on my family match the broader autistic phenotype. My maternal grandfather was most definitely autistic. Last time I said this, the person I was speaking to literally replied that this was impossible because autism didn't even exist until Kanner started studying it in the 1940s. I suppose that is the logical conclusion of "rates and incidence are always the same", but I laughed right in her face. Kanner himself noted that the parents of the children he worked with showed autistic traits. (It is this observation that led to the monstrous "refrigerator mother" hypothesis  which has now been thoroughly debunked, but the observation itself was quite correct.) You can see, though, if you haven't thought of it, that we really only have accurate information about autism going back a few generations at best. It's only recently, for example, that we've found that men who are older when they father their first child are more likely to have an autistic child (that applies to my father!) or grandchild (and that one applies to my mother's father). The jury is most definitely out on why this should be so, though - is it because something happens to the sperm as men age? Or is it because men and women who show autistic traits are slower to enter into relationships and take longer to start having sex? That is also most definitely possible - just as it is possible that people who show autistic traits prefer to be in relationships with other people who show autistic traits, a form of assortive mating, and one that is evidently true within my own family, though I cannot speak for how common that really is. 




 Incorrect... or, at least, only partially correct. Prior to the DSM-IV, people with Asperger's couldn't get diagnosed, and thus weren't included in the statistics... which, back then, were fairly patchy.

It's fairly common for adult autistics to only get a diagnosis now after a child in the family is diagnosed. Heck, my parents *knew* I was on the spectrum, and they tried to get a diagnosis back then, but it just didn't happen. I was a girl, I could talk quite well (well, if you don't consider that an inability to switch out of a formal register and a marked difficulty with figurative speech are problematic) and so little things like the fact that I didn't make eye contact or point to things at the age of eight were overlooked. 




 Note: Autism isn't a mental illness, it is a developmental disorder. 




 Not gooood, grooood. 




 She didn't make things worse this time.  




 There's a big difference between "keeping secrets" and "lying". Every time he spoke to her as The Flash, he was implicitly lying to her. (And I've said it before, but here I'll say it again, when somebody says they don't want a romantic relationship with you, you need to back off, and so does your costumed alter ego.)

Additionally, Barry had a moral obligation to inform her when her ignorance was putting her in peril. Which it *was*, precisely *because* her life had been threatened. With that information, maybe she could've gone on an extended vacation abroad, away from the RF's reach. 




 Yes, Kira rocks. But she wasn't a captain, and she only wore a Starfleet uniform for a few episodes. Where you gonna get a Bajoran uniform? 




  Yeah, that's a clever dodge, except that Trek didn't operate that way until the Abrams films, so the writers of that episode did wipe out the timeline in favor of that new one. 

Oh, didn't it? I present [Exhibit A: Parallels.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_%28Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation%29) As seen in that episode, diverging histories lead to divergent universes. The multiverse is, and has been canon, and not just the mirror universe. As further proof, we have [Deadlock](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Deadlock_%28episode%29) - two Voyagers enter, one Voyager leaves. (And nobody ever brings it up again, which is odd, but par for the course.)

To our knowledge, none of these alternate worlds were caused by time travel. However, our knowledge is patchy at best. We don't know the exact circumstances that created *any* of those branches in the multiverse. Therefore, it could have worked that way from the beginning. You certainly cannot assert confidently that it did *not*.

As proof that Janeway did care, the people who were in on her plan had made plans for the future. They expected to keep on living even if she succeeded in her one-woman mission. Barclay did not run off to Risa, he continued teaching. The Doctor didn't immediately run and tattle to Starfleet Command, he only told Harry. Kim did not laugh madly as he decided to help her, he pointed out he would get "demoted to ensign" once caught.  




 If it'd been photoshopped on, don't you think she wouldn't've worn the purple turtleneck under it? 




 That wouldn't help you very much with learning a new dialect or language. To eliminate or alter an accent you'd want to deal with a vocal coach. 




 You don't have to personally kill the rats, just  go down to a pet store and get feeder rats for snakes. Or heck, put out a few snap traps in the alley and call it a public service 




 1. Ravi becoming a zombie. Has potential. I kinda ship Ravi/Liv anyway.

2. Maybe it's because Iris finally found out on The Flash about, well, The Flash, but I'm big on bringing people into the loop. Specifically, Major. Major needs to be brought in on this whole zombie thing. (And eventually Clive does as well.)

3. I knew zombie!Arthur had a 50/50 shot of being bad news.

4. What the hell did Blaine mean "she has her part to play" or whatever exactly he said? 




 The 25th century. He came back in time to kill The Flash, because he's crazy and going back in time to kill people is, according to the wiki, pretty much how he solves all his problems. 




 It's enough to give anybody trust issues. 




 I'm thinking most men would've been more upset as well if their best friend did this to them. 




 ...a wizard did it? 




 Except for the whole keeping Iris in the dark thing. Well, at least that's finally over. 




 He kinda *does* have to go help everyone at every time. He's a superhero, that's the job description. He certainly has to help his substitute father figure. 




 Or at least, I don't know, *use* them. 




 He hasn't eaten in *centuries*. 




 Well, after living in a sewer we should just assume he IS dirty. 




 You know what would've happened if they'd done that? She would have said the exact same thing I'm about to say: Her life wasn't threatened "if she knows Barry is The Flash", her life was threatened "if you (Joe) keep digging into this". And Joe kept digging into it and didn't tell her anything!

If he really wanted to keep her safe, he should have told her *everything*. Knowledge is most definitely power when there are people who have threatened your life. 




  
 
 
 
 Wells talked him through that vibrating through solid objects trick--it's something Barry should be able to do, but not something he can do at the drop of a hat right now.

He ought to be practicing new tricks at home or something. 




 Maybe Grodd came to his own conclusions about that one. 




 So maybe if he already threatened her life, *as she pointed out*, she would have been safer if she'd been kept in the loop! 




  the fact that she wiped out an entire timeline at the end of the series in order to satisfy her own selfish wants and desires is in itself reason to detest her and not want to emulate or champion anything about her.

So did Jake Sisko, but he doesn't get this level of hate. Neither does Harry Kim, for that matter. (And if we believe that the new Star Trek movies exist simultaneously with TOS - which is what the writers insist is the case - then surely Janeway did the same thing. She didn't "wipe out" a timeline, she just created an additional one that runs alongside the first.) 




 No. No, it wasn't you. It was /r/botsrights. 




 He didn't tell Eddie that!

Also: Iris is a grown woman. She does not need her dad to be her marriage and dating gatekeeper. She does not need him to be her matchmaker.  




  Shining voyager far from home....

That's a great episode where nobody at all angsts even a tiny little bit about breaking the prime directive, even though you'd think they'd at least give it some lip service. The plot is better for it. 




 Only by breaking the temporal prime directive! 




 Not lost like "destroyed", lost like "misplaced". I think ending up in the Delta Quadrant is pretty darn lost!

(At any rate, given that she did end up admiral, I was mostly engaging in snark rather than seriously suggesting that she should've been demoted.) 




 Well, then? You tell us who is supposed to be punishing them and I'll send whoever it is a strongly worded letter to that effect. 




 She lost her ship! She could hardly expect to be promoted to admiral upon her return, could she? 




 Sometimes smart people can be incredibly stupid. The blog isn't unethical, it's just risky. 




 In real life NYC, the rising costs of housing is a VERY real issue. Anybody making moves to kick low-income renters out of their apartments, even without the violence, really *is* a villain to the public. 




 Not as main characters and you know it. 




 Yes, but which half? 




 Who knows what that did to its digestive system? 




 Yeah, but what a stupid messiah. All she does is show up when it's time to land on a planet? Seriously? Who the heck has a religion like that? 




 That's dedication for you. 




 Living well is the best revenge. Have yourself a marathon!  




 Maybe he gave it up like the time Riker was Q and decided he didn't want to stay Q. 




 Because she can be the captain and drink coffee. Duh. 




 Well, I walked right into that one. 














 God, who *doesn't* love the Satanists? 




 If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?

NO SENSE.

And I never understood any of Kissed By A Rose. None of it.
 




 I must say, only eating orange food is a new one by me :) With toddlers, so often they'll only eat white foods (rice, pasta, cheese sticks, plain chicken breast) or only eat brown foods (chicken nuggets, peanut butter, chocolate chip cookies). Orange at least gives you room for healthy foods, even if many of them will turn her orange! (But it's harmless, seriously.)

I would suggest that if she is eating fewer than 15 foods and this has been going on for longer than three months, or if this is severely impacting her health and/or ability to function, or if you have reason to suspect that this might be a component of a broader disorder such as autism, reflux, or sensory processing disorder, that you speak to your pediatrician about getting a referral to a speech-language pathologist (yes, even if she has no speech issues) or an occupational therapist to help with the "pickiness". 

That's not intended to scare you. I suggest it every time, because so often parents don't know where the line is between "normal pickiness" and "not normal pickiness" is.

If you're confident she's in the normal range, then what you want to do is start with baby steps. This might mean having her get through dinner without screaming that you put some green beans on her plate and don't you KNOW she HATES those. Or, if she is willing to sit with those things on her plate, it might mean getting her to sniff the green bean and maybe put it in her mouth before quietly spitting it out. Baaaaaby steps. 

What sort of foods does she eat right now? I'm thinking squashes, sweet potato, carrots, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, oranges, tangerines? Anything else? 




 My own mother went (so she says) three years on pasta, salami, mushrooms, and apples. Her parents figured they were doing a good job getting her to eat and didn't stress it. "Disciplining" children for food issues is counterproductive - it just turns the dinner table into a battleground and entrenches their rule to "never eat that yucky stuff".

Oh, and in my mother's case? She hadn't "decided to be picky". She had undiagnosed asthma and only ate foods that she knew from experience she could eat without having to chew too long, because if she had her mouth shut she *couldn't breathe*. There are many reasons for a child to go through periods of refusing certain foods. Many aspies, for example, go through bouts of only eating foods of a certain color, and it's terribly common for children of all stripes to be unable to eat certain textures of food. Rarely is it them "deciding" to be "picky". 




 Best place to start is this: what sort of food do you like to eat? No matter how healthy it is, no matter how much of a budget it is, it won't do any good if you don't like to eat it. We start with the foods you already enjoy, then we branch out.

So... what do you like to eat? Maybe we can figure out some ways to make 'em cheaper and healthier. 




 Yes, they do need to talk about it on the show. (Also about Cisco's ridiculous little crush. I think that entire blog is freaking adorable as heck.) 




 Why is there a /r/botsrights sub? 




 Except you need to put up quite a bit of money up front. When you're living hand to mouth, you don't have that - especially when you have no idea how long food takes to go bad, or whether you can pay the electric bill this month, or if you're gonna screw it up and end up with inedible hockey pucks.

You're not doing a good job of putting yourself in other peoples' shoes. 




 I meant that you don't prefer. Is there any part of the US that only gets the native species of wrens and blue birds? (Serious question, because I surely have no clue.)

 edit: starlings also aren't native, but I leave them alone.

That makes you unusual. I've tolerated starlings (not a birder, but I know the general opinion of them) ever since I saw one rescue a mourning dove by flying right in the face of a cat, but.... 




 Are you allowed to pull out the nest and eggs of "anything else nesting" if it happens to be a dispreferred native species? 






















































 My mother (who has a mean sense of humor) hid her key under a *neighbor's* door mat. Well, until we found out and made her stop.

She also spoke about getting a collection of those fake rocks and putting useless keys in 'em. One of these years somebody's gonna break one of her windows. 




 Well, if it's official canon I take back much of what I've said about those prisoners not having any TV. They get movie nights. And it is adorable. (Still, it's illegal detention and more or less solitary confinement and dubiously ethical as hell.) 









 His procedure took two months, and has a high failure rate, as seen by those episodes where Jack et al. show up. (It's stated, iirc, that the success rate might be better if they could get this done legally... but "better" doesn't necessarily mean "without high risk". We don't know what the failure rate really is.) We have no idea how long it would take in utero, nor if the success rate would be any better. We cannot assume that because *this* condition can be easily treated in utero - more easily than after birth - that *another* condition is the same way. 














 Yeah, but Paris considered his Starfleet father to be emotionally abusive. Weren't they estranged at the start of that show? 




 But if you're not going to eat those things before they go bad (or get too freezerburned), you've wasted that money.  




 Ground beef where I am is $6/lb, easy. I could buy the huge family packages and get the price down to $4.50/lb, but I have no place to store that much ground beef. My freezer isn't that big.

Tomatoes surely aren't $1/lb either unless I get the hard ones that taste like nothing and are a waste of money. Actually, I'm pretty sure those are $1.30/lb anyway.

That cheese looks off too, but I don't know for sure. I'll check at the store. 




 You can rinse it and pre-soak it, that will cut down the cooking time. 




 You're speaking like somebody who knows how to cook :) 




 Oddly, there are many people in the US who don't have consistent access to a fridge or a stove. People in shelters, people who are living in motels, people who are renting a single room in some woman's house... these people are kinda stuck. 




 And don't forget, if your budget is that strapped, you don't want to have to throw food out. What if you screw up the rice? What if your kids decide they won't eat the beans? Hamburgers are safer, because they always taste good. 




 It's not very healthy if you need to eat low-carb, say, due to diabetes. And you're really underestimating the food ignorance out there - I cannot tell you how many times I've suggested to somebody that they start off with dried beans only to be told that they can't use an entire pound of the stuff at once and are afraid what's left will go bad. 




 We saw them fix the spinal defects. Are mental defects such as the one Bashir faced as easy to fix? 




 Mmm, "orphan" can mean a child who has lost one out of two parents. That's not the usual definition, but it has been used that way, usually in the context of "widows and orphaned children" where one presumes that we care about the orphaned children even if their widowed mother is still alive. 




 It's canon that everybody has enough food and medical care and a place to live and clothes and leisure time and an education. It is not canon that everybody gets everything they could ever want.

Let's suppose that only a tiny minority of doctors is capable of doing this sort of genetic engineering - perhaps one for every thousand babies. No amount of going "but we're post scarcity!" is going to make that number higher. 




 Why would we need to be able to do that? 




  Good thing the Federation is post-scarcity and thus everybody can "afford" it.

Post-scarcity doesn't mean "everybody gets what they want". It means "everybody gets what they need". 

 There is nothing inherently bad about becoming super-human. All it means is that we are objectively better than we were before.

"better" is not by any means an objective word. 






















































 Maybe it's really hard to do it right, and there's 99 failures - even with legitimate doctors instead of the back alley approach - for every "success". 


































 It's the oldest one we've found, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is the first. There may have been others which have been lost.

 




 I read that book at least once a year. 














 When were you in the 4th grade? 














 Yeah, sounds like a lot of victim blaming in your family. It's more likely than you think.  




 Space is big. Really big. Really, really big, and three-dimensional as well. So long as the Krenim aren't causing any substantial trouble, the Zahl probably don't think it's worth the effort to try to track them down.  




 And Tuvix, who gave a reasonably good deathbed speech. (Not that good, but, y'know, he was pressed for time.) 




 Okay, first of all, you're assuming that Julian is utterly truthful about how impaired he was before the procedure. That's the assumption I usually make as well - no exaggeration, he's not misremembering. However, in fairness, it is *possible* he is mistaken somehow.

So you've more or less asked two questions resting on that assumption.

The first is, why on earth didn't Julian merit genetic treatment under the law? And that is an *excellent* question, because that's pretty darn impaired. Exactly what sort of therapy or help *was* he entitled to? No answers on that front, and I wish there were. I agree with you wholeheartedly here. Julian Bashir should have had *real* help for his *real* problems. Had he been able to get that, this whole second question could have been avoided, because he probably would have ended up as average instead of as a super genius.

The second is about whether or not it's moral to punish the child for the sins of the parents. In this case, I have to disagree with your conclusion. If you only punish the parents, you run the risk that pushy parents are going to risk it anyway to give their children an edge. And if the pushy parents do it, then a great deal of non-pushy parents are going to feel they have to do it as well just so their kids can keep up! Remember, Julian's parents didn't ethically stay within the spirit of the law (if not the letter) by simply having his impairments corrected, no, they made him *special*. And that's what every other parent would end up doing if there was a loophole. You can't be honest if everybody else is cheating. The only way to ensure that people don't break the law is to make sure that if it's caught, it all comes for nothing and *everybody* involved, parents and children, gets punished - the parents by being imprisoned, the children by being locked out of the best jobs. It's unfair, but at least that method has a chance of working.

One note: We have no idea if his genetic changes are heritable. It's not unheard of for people to carry two genetic codes. There's a case of a [woman who was accused of welfare fraud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Fairchild) because genetic testing on her children showed they were somebody else's! It wasn't until they tested the third immediately after she gave birth that they realized her reproductive organs had a different set of chromosomes than the rest of her body. There's no reason that this might not have been done to Julian. (But was it? I have no clue.) 




 Thanks :) 




 Yes, but do you really think that schools are unsegregated today? Not in NYC they're not. 




 Oh, god, I had teachers like that. Fuck 'em. 




 All trains of thought eventually hit the racism station, have you noticed? 




 Until recently? 




 Because if we accept that dialect we're "dumbing down" English.

If you ask what the hell that even means, they go "It's common sense".

If you point out that they used the phrase "it's common sense" rather than explaining what the hell they mean, they whine that you're mean. 




   The assumption that there's anyone on reddit who's unaware of this controversy by this point.

They may as well ask if we've heard of Jesus Christ. 




 That, my friend, is why I exclusively say "from the gecko". I mean I don't, but I think it in my head. 




 Is your aunt, um, all right? I mean, I don't want to make fun of people who are *actually*, you know, not... right. 


































 Alternatively, you will see a world where police are even more obsessed with covering shit up, because they're scared of the collective punishment. 




 Punished by whom? The cops? Yeah, right. Buffy? She's got a blind spot a mile wide when it comes to people she cares about. The Watchers? To be honest, I'm not sure they *care* so long as they don't call too much attention to themselves. So who does that leave to do the punishing? 




 Her mom loved this other kid she made up in her head, her *son*. She was in huge denial over the real kid she had living with her. It's not so surprising she didn't want to accept the suicide, especially as suicide is also widely considered a major sin. 





































































 LOL, I'm not criticizing, though if you think it's better we can just delete everything and pretend it never happened. I'm just gonna assume that anybody interested in the subject *is* caught up. 




 Yeah... of course, if I hadn't, that reply would have given away everything. That's why I didn't bother with spoiler tags, because their very existence gives away everything :P 




 That title is too long, and spoils the ending. 




 Really? Do you have a link? I'm surprised Einstein has an opinion on this!  




 Oh god that's painful to read. 




 Yeah, if he's the only one doing the zombification.  




 Okay, but nobody else knows she's in the loop yet because that just happened, and since she had to figure it out on her own I don't think that counts. 




 I could never stand Kes. Seven at least doesn't give off this air of being mystically perfect. 




 Except for Iris. EVERYBODY IS IN THE LOOP BUT HER. (I don't care if you like the character or not, that's just not right.) 




 Liv has met two zombies. Each of them did the "how do you get your brains?" thing first time. Whats-his-face-Bad-Guy said he got his by grave robbing. Lowell says that a guy at the morgue will look the other way for cash. We know that Whats-his-face is lying. 





























 Honey, if somebody is "rejecting your kindness" that's because you're not actually being kind. You're being a nuisance, and they want you to stop.

And yes, kind people are nice to everybody.  









 The ! part means not... though not in IPA, where it means an alveolar click. (Wait, am I [reading this right?](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/IPA_chart_%28C%292005.pdf)) 




 It's gonna be a cover *now*. Doubtful it was involved in the brain "farming" before. 




 Oh, I'm sure it's an excuse. I'm just saying that the fact that it's an excuse doesn't actually preclude them finding bodies on the property. 





























 And it doesn't actually work. Torture is not a solution. 




 Killing Blaine = huge power vacuum. Simple murder is not the solution here. 




 Maybe he just think it's cooler that way. 




 Torture doesn't really work. I mean, at least in this scenario they really know he's the one who is doing the bad things, and they have a good idea what those bad things are, but when you torture people they say whatever they can to make you stop and you're stuck with the difficult job of determining which, if any of it, is true. 




 That's not really the consequences of her cowardice, more like the consequences of Lowell's impetuous stupidity.  
































































 LOL, no worries. Turns out the actor has a role on a new series, so the odds of him being alive are dropping to zilch. Booo. It's not even a series I'm particularly interested in watching, to add insult to injury here. 




 Stop ruining my hopes and dreams. 




 True enough, I suppose. 




 That's because she didn't know him that well. She had been planning to *marry* Major. 

If nothing else, she and Ravi need to sit down and discuss the issue of disclosure, with Ravi pointing out that keeping Major in the dark is putting him in danger. 




 Thus making the producers the most diabolical supervillains ever. 




 How do we really know he kept his promise not to tell his sister?

Barry's real problem here is that he gave up his side of the bargain first. If he'd said "I've destroyed the physical evidence, but I won't destroy the digital evidence until after they're in the new place" then things might have turned out differently. 




 Maybe Cisco has been transgender this whole time. Which would be a remarkable move for a TV show. Really, I'd remark upon it. 




 Apparently, the only way a test pilot could ever go missing is if he's Hal Jordan, who is the Green Lantern. (Did I get that right?) 




 No, most likely this is part of his diabolical plan. 




 He took the train.  




 Either sex or more money than Barry's got in his account. 




 Also, the more I think of it - if they can't destroy the future device, can't they blow up the particle accelerator, make the future device useless that way? 




 Maybe he's not sure either. 




 True, very true. But look at Ravi. He supports her - and he's known her for much less time than Major has. 




 We didn't see if it was a headshot. 




 No. Nobody else noticed that. 




 Geez, thank goodness I have you guys to go "OMG GREEN LANTERN!" because I would have never known. I mean, I guessed it was a reference to *something*, but I thought it was Arrow-y. 




 Oh, Major. You're sweet, but so very, very stupid. 




 Completely lost track of time, watching it now.

1. Poor Eddie looks broken. Aw! Eddie! *hugs*

2. Was that whole convo with the DA just so we could be told "Yup, we know that the prison thing is dubiously ethical *at best*"? (Even with the movie nights.) Because it seems like it was shoehorned in.

3. Maybe I shouldn't, but I really like Snart. I mean, *really*.

4. My goodness, what was it Barry couldn't agree to? Large sums of cash? Weapons? A three day free-for-all? A date with Lisa? A date with *Leonard*? ARGH! I WANNA KNOW!

5. Actually, Snart/Barry would be kinda hot. I mean cool. I mean... you know what I mean. I'll be in my bunk.

6. And you guys all say that *Iris* is pointlessly emotional. Mind, I'd be pretty upset by that revelation myself.

7. WHY THE HELL DON'T THEY LOCK THE DOOR??? Or put up some surveillance or *something*? Geez!

8. Now Barry's having a meltdown. And you all say... oh, never mind. I suppose anybody would be upset by current events.

9. Caitlin, I was wondering the same thing. Barry never resists a chance to yank off that stupid thing, reveal his identity to the world but now he keeps it on? What, is he afraid of somebody walking in? THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IF YOU WOULD LOCK THE DOORS!

10. Geez, Barry was right to roll his eyes, Caitlin *is* really uptight. Is now the right time to be worried about who kissed whom?

11. Did they... not even warn these folks in advance about what was going to happen? Cisco! You have movie nights and disco with these guys! Joe! You want to rehabilitate them! Barry! You're irrationally concerned about saving their lives even as you violate each and every one of their basic freedoms and human rights! Geez, guys, pretend to be upstanding citizens already!

12. FFS, and they didn't restrain these guys at all in the truck? Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I thought these people were supposed to be smart, all of them.

13. Well, Snart was smart. Man, I probably shouldn't, but I *really* like him.

14. Ah, the big showdown!

15. Ollie, Barry IS moving!

16. God, I love a good fight scene.  Now I just need to watch next week's previews. 




 Because humans have a steady supply of more humans from the Federation. Talaxians in an asteroid don't... except when they literally do in the form of Neelix. 




 I admit, I giggled when I caught the joke. 




 It wouldn't have worked, not really.

If she had shot him, then all the zombies relying on his brain service would have had to fend for themselves. Some of them - particularly his muscle - would have tried to go into business for themselves. More zombies would have been created. More people would have been outright murdered. Sooner or later, there'd be a horde chomping its way down the streets of Seattle.

Blaine is evil, no doubt about it, but he represents order and stability for Team Z. Take him down without a plan to handle his little kingdom and your little problems rapidly become BIG problems. 




 Sorry about that, by the way. I just feel *really* strongly about this. I won't so much as buy a particular brand of potato chips because they donate a portion of their proceeds to you-know-who. 




 I can think of exactly one thing. This year, during the measles outbreak, they came out and said people should vaccinate their kids. Ta-da!

Ten years I've been reading articles about them, and this is the only one that didn't make me want to cry and/or vomit. 




 Gee, what a surprise. 




 I'm in NYC, so I don't know much about Alabama specific charities. A quick glance at their website didn't show that they're aligned with that particular super evil organization (I feel really strongly about this) so they're probably all right :) 




 Hallelujah.  




 It'd be one thing if they were ignorant, but given that they've been doing this for ten years I think they know darn well what they're doing and just don't care. 




 Please don't. Set it up so that the money goes to the Autism Society of America or the Autism Self Advocacy Network instead. 

Only 4% of the funds AS takes in go on services to help autistics and their families. Their board members have salaries higher than the norm for comparable organizations. The flyer posted upthread gives a good rundown of some of their issues, but believe me, it's just the tip of the iceberg.

http://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Autism_Speaks_Flyer.pdf 




 Because they are evil. I do not throw that word around lightly.

Let me tell you a funny anecdote. Two years ago I read an article about a woman who had gotten a new job. It was a great job, and she just had one small issue. She asked - asked, not demanded - if she could leave work a few hours early one day a week so she could meet her autistic son on his early dismissal day. She wanted to work from home in the afternoon that day, or perhaps come in a couple of hours earlier and make up the time that way. For simply *asking* if this was a possibility, they rescinded the job offer.

I posted this story on my blog and asked some real life friends this question: Which not-for-profit is involved here?

Obviously you know, because I wouldn't tell this story without a point, but they didn't have the hints you did, I just dropped this subject in out of nowhere. Would you believe that out of the twentyfive people I asked, *every single one of them* got it right on the first try?

Do you know why? Because it's always freaking Autism Speaks! When you hear that a kindergarten teacher led the class in voting out an autistic student, do you know which is the sole autism organization not to condemn this behavior? Autism Speaks! When you hear that a facility in the US has been condemned by the UN for shocking its residents, do you know which is the sole autism organization to recommend this facility to parents? Autism Speaks! When you hear that one organization gives its board members a higher salary than comparable organizations, and in fact gave them a *raise* in the middle of a recession, when similar organizations were cutting their costs, which organization is that? Autism Speaks! 

I'm not even mentioning the Autism Every Day debacle. (http://www.veoh.com/watch/e133765ejW4nXnh?h1=Autism+Everyday) In the wake of that little film, two autistic children were murdered by their parents in the US, Christopher DeGroot and Katie McCarron. Christopher's parents *locked him in his room* and set the house on fire. They didn't serve any prison time. Given that the film shows a mother stating *in front of her verbal autistic daughter* that the only thing that has kept her from killing herself and that daughter is thoughts of what it would do to her NT daughter (which is tacky, if nothing else), the whole situation was a public relations disaster. And do you know what their response was? "Every parent of a child with autism secretly wants their child dead."

Bullshit. 

I have been following news stories about Autism Speaks since they arrived on the scene. Not once in ten years have they not been utterly and totally in the wrong. That's an impressive track record. I'm dead serious, I'd sooner give all my money to the Scientologists and go live as a clown than let one penny of mine enter Autism Speaks' grubby little pockets.

If you want to donate to an autism related organization, I suggest either the Autism Self Advocacy Network or the Autism Society of America. 




 Oh, it's a *total* copout. Among other things, aren't they a good 40 years from Talaxian space at that point? How the heck did the Talaxians get there so fast? (And isn't that tiny colony worried about having a profound genetic bottleneck?) 




 Ow. 




 Aren't there two or three VM books by now? 




 Well, here's the thing.

1. His home planet was utterly nuked in the war, along with all his family and childhood friends.

2. His species and all or most of their official planets are occupied territory.

3. He had spent a lengthy period of time on Voyager by the time Kes left and formed friendly bonds with most of the crew. 

So no, he didn't have anything better to do with his life than be a crewman on Voyager. 




 Yeah, Blaine definitely makes a great villain.  




 No more than he was before. 




 Damn, I hope Lowell isn't really dead. They didn't show the body either this time or in the previews, so maybe not.

AND FFS, LOOP MAJOR IN ON THE ZOMBIE THING! I'm *so* sick of major characters not being told crucial information - and yes, I'm looking at you, Flash! Ignorance doesn't keep people safe. 




 Better than being the "Kes is so adorable and perfect!" show. Blech. 




 Spooooooky. 














 YES. They're freaking adorable, that's why. 




 My goodness, they really do. In *all* the subs. 




 I made the same mistake at first. 




 Maybe she has a closed circuit monitor in there. 




 Like the time Harry blew up Aunt Marge? 




 Well.... 




 Every time people link to the Daily Fail, I feel like pointing out that's the newspaper *Vernon Dursley* reads. 




 My god, it's really everywhere. You cannot escape it. You say "Okay, I just won't read /r/flashtv for a little while, let everybody get it all out of their systems" and them - bam, here it is in /r/news! 




 Wow. I remember the first season. I watched it, thought it was an interesting enough premise, figured there was no way they'd be a success if they tried it a second time. 

This is why I don't play the stock market. 




 That'd be a great argument if ignorance could keep her safe. 




 And it's the only wizarding school, period. Scared your kid might reveal all to the muggles? Your only other option is homeschooling. Do we really believe Crabbe and Goyle were given anything like a decent education prior to Hogwarts? Maybe if they'd been in a *school* somebody would have flagged them for special education and they'd be doing better by adolescence! Muggle home educators in the UK at least know that testing and evaluation are options. Wizards often seem a little behind the times, socially. Do they have any idea how to treat learning disabilities and the like? 




 The Wizarding World isn't really big enough for healthy competition in the business world. There's one "reputable" daily paper, and perhaps only a small handful of people with the skills and inclination to write for it. 




 Every freaking week I go "Aaaaaaah, now I have to wait a few months for the next one!" and every week I'm wrong. 


































 Did they? I didn't see it, thanks.  







































 This is how some people enjoy themselves. If you don't like it, move on. "Relax", as you say. 




 Didn't sound like it from the joke. 




 Yes, and just like Duncan I utterly forgot about him when posing that question. 














 Okay, so who's Duncan in this scenario? 









 Except they didn't. They've been steadily rolling back reproductive freedom over the past few decades. 









 No, abortion isn't murder - abortion being murder is generally held as  a *right wing position*,  btw, not a left wing one, and so has nothing to do with "social justice warriors" - but, again, those countries which ban it *cannot* allow it in the case of rape without revealing their own hypocrisy, as the only reason they have for such a ban is "well, it's murder".

They can allow it to protect the life of the mother without looking terribly hypocritical, but that's it. 




 Seems a little inconsistent.

If you're anti-abortion because you think it's murder - and many do think that, even at very early stages where there's no brain stem, much less brain *activity* - it's not suddenly less murder because the mother was raped. 

Either elective abortion (that is, abortion not because the fetus has a condition incompatible with life or is already dead and not because the mother's life is at risk) at various points during pregnancy should be legal or it should not. Those who are anti-abortion can't *afford* to cede on the rape front because that shows their position as hypocritical. 




 Until the more-or-less "Federation" ex-drones decided, in the name of peace and cooperation, to forcibly drag all the other ex-drones back into their little makeshift collective-of-sorts and we're left wondering how independent the individuals will *really* be in the long run. 




 Consider the Ferengi, though - three out of four onscreen mirror Ferengi are nice and reasonably charitable.

 Mercola is a nitwit, not a researcher.

And autism *isn't* on the rise, ffs. I've already addressed this, and I'm pretty sure I did it in response to you. If you use the current diagnostic standards and sift through a randomly chosen group of adults, you will find the same rate of autism as you will in children.

Come to think, I'm pretty sure I addressed the Amish myth to you as well. The Amish have just as much autism as anybody else - and they get vaccinated at the same rates as the rest of the population, and their food is NOT organic. They use GMOs and conventional farming techniques, the same amount of pesticides and herbicides as anybody else.  




 Man, Quark gets some good speeches.

Not in Washington, except with federally licensed firearms dealers, and you can find out about that if you scroll down to the summary of federal law section. Suffice to say, the guy selling the gun may not even have been breaking the law if he makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms. He just does these sales in alleys for kicks. 




 Oh, man. Be sure to post here on the most recent episode thread when you figure out who the main villain is. I wanna hear your reaction! 




 : ) 

















































 Yeah, but Wells and Barry aren't the only ones they need to concern themselves with. 




 Anything with seeds is a fruit, except strawberries. Strawberries are not a fruit. They are pseudocarps. (Because the seeds are not contained in the ripened ovary of the plant, that's why.) 




 How does that relate to my comment?  




 Except, oddly, it didn't really mean that even then. I strongly suggest you read some of Kanner's work. I found the experience illuminating. 




 The idea for inclusion is that it's beneficial for all students in the classroom - not just the ones with disabilities - and that it helps the children *academically*. It's not just so people "don't feel different or bad about themselves".  




 Autism is generally apparent by 18 months - and they're working on screening that can catch it earlier. So, no. 




 What researchers? Can you name them? 




 Okay. And where are you getting your stats that high functioning autistics are less common than low functioning? 




 In my experience, most schools have bullying, for all they say otherwise. And most schools don't handle inclusion the way they ought to. However, because most parents and children are stuck with schools and don't have the option to do something else, inclusion is the better option for many of them. 




 Given your other comments, I'm not certain you know what the diagnostic criteria said in the DSM-IV, much less what it says now, nor that you have much idea of what the implications of the new criteria might be. 




 So you believe "some article" over the actual DSM? 




 The word is "inclusion"... and while I do think that inclusion is generally the way to go, I *also* believe firmly that if a child is being maltreated that being educated at home and having socialization outside of school may be the better approach.

Bullying during childhood can have lifelong effects. 




 But he never received an autism diagnosis? 




 Exactly how are you defining "especially high functioning"? 




 While I'm inclined to agree in principle, "a suit from a ring" is one of the cute little things that shows up when you upvote comments. It can't be that much of a surprise. 




 Bananas split! Bananas unite! Banana to the left, banana to the right! 




 I keep reading that as "nasty in the pasta". Never gonna eat rigatoni again.

 So over in /r/flashtv people are talking about iZombie, and over *here* we've got folks talking about The Flash.

I can't tell where I am anymore. I should probably be more worried about this. 




  I know Blaine is a big bad but I'm kiiinda into the whole look it's probably Spike related.

Yup. 




 No! Barry/Cisco otp 4eva! 




 Do people in your part of the country not have lube? 




 Well, all people grow and learn, including autistics. However, it is important to remember a few things, most of all that autism is not solely about socializing and that socializing "normally" is not always the goal.  




 Oh, I see. Well, it's pretty common among autistics, especially those of us with gross motor issues. I don't know what else could cause it, but I'm sure there could be any number of things. It's *really* common for people who are interested in the subject and think they might be on the spectrum to start attributing anything and everything to autism - but it's equally common for people who don't know about it or who are in denial to strenuously insist on any other explanation, no matter how far-fetched, for anything that looks "autistic". (This paragraph is mostly pedantry, do not assume I'm saying you do any of this!)

 what can I do about it other than develop compensating habits

If this is something that impacts your ability to work, you may be able to qualify for specific accommodations with a diagnosis. However, not everybody finds that necessary or useful. 




 For a fun, anecdotal version of this: http://www.backfromnature.org/2015/03/i-gave-my-child-autism.html

Notice it took her several years to put the pieces together, and even then, somebody had to outright suggest it to her. She was open to the suggestion. Many parents of autistic children are in strong denial about their own place on the spectrum.

From my own life, after I started pursuing a diagnosis I started having a lot of conversations with my mother that went like this: 

Me: This article, bah, it talks about this autistic kid and it says he 'doesn't play with his toys, just lines them up', which is ridiculous because - 

Mom: Yeah, it is. That's how children play!

Me: Um, sure. If they're autistic.

Mom: Well, that's how I played as a child, and my brother did too, and so did you!

Me: Uh-huh. Well, we've established that *I* am autistic....

(In point of fact, my mother had established that in my infancy. Nobody bothered to inform me of this, despite actively seeking a diagnosis during my childhood. It was very character-building to sort it all out on my own as a teenager. I never want my character built ever again.) 




 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2083102/ 




 Not really. The assortative mating theory of autism... well, I disagree with the essential premise that actual incidence rates of autism are increasing, however, it's backed on sound evidence.

Autism does have a strong genetic component. It is common for autistics and members of the broader autistic phenotype to self-select friends and spouses who are also on the spectrum. (Anecdotally, that's how I got here. Hi.) That's all.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2083102/ 




  I think the general consensus is that forced socialization of ASD kids is to the benefit of both ASD kids and regular kids. 

Does that consensus come with the input of autistic adults...? 




 It is known that men who have children later in life are more likely to have autistic children and grandchildren, yes. 




 It is known that men who father children later in life are more likely to have autistic children and grandchildren. However, to my knowledge we have not yet determined if this is because the sperm changes or because people with autistic traits simply have children later in life than NTs, or both. 




 There is no evidence that the actual incidence of autism is increasing. That's what this article is about. 




 Evolution in long-lifed species such as humans simply does not work that quickly. 




  For a terrorist.

For an anybody. Also, I think the preferred term is "freedom fighter". 




  In Trek timeline corrections are pursued to repair a broken universe, such as in "City On The Edge Of Forever" and "Yesterday's Enterprise", or the characters wouldn't go through the bother of trying to fix what went wrong.

Or perhaps they just want to go home to their own universe where they understand everything, or simply aren't 100% certain of how this whole time travel universe changing works. (And that does NOT mean that Janeway is being reckless. Admiral Janeway has more information than we do, because she's lived longer.) We don't know that these "wrong" universes cease to exist when "fixed", you're just assuming that. 




 It makes sense to most people. Of course, it's entirely possible that both factors are true. 




 I think we're saying the same thing differently. My comment was more "autistics start fitting into the same bell curve as NTs when tested differently". 




 You are the one stating that "they are diagnosing kids too much", and then stating "if they're doing that, it's just lazy". You're assuming the premise. That's what's really lazy. 




 That's nowhere in the diagnostic criteria. 




 You might try asking in /r/aspergers.  




 Damn, it's been years since I've heard about the Amish. Where do I start?

Well, let's start with the fact that if you know what you're looking at, the Amish have autism rates about the same as everybody else. They simply don't diagnose as much.

Even if they DID have a low rate of autism, they also have one of the highest rates of polydactyly in the world. Why? The founder effect. So that could also explain it - a founder effect that leads to reduced cases in autism. (But doesn't, because they don't have less autism than the rest of us.) 


































 Interesting fact I only recently learned: Apparently, Q Jr. was played by John de Lancie's actual son. The things you learn at 3am when you ought to be asleep. 




 And how many of them did she get involved with, in the end? 




 Maybe his aim wasn't that good. 




 But Gideon doesn't know what this Barry Allen should do. Gideon knows what *that* Barry Allen did. 




 How can light be both a particle and a wave? 

The answer probably is "the writers didn't sit down and plan out a coherent idea of how time travel works beforehand, they just went with what they thought looked cool and, yes, advanced the plot". Which is unfortunate, but I've decided to turn off my brain regarding that little detail. (It's okay if you don't take that route.) 




 I suppose. 




 Unethical? I don't think so. She has a pretty strong case for necessity here.  




 THAT IS UTTERLY BEYOND THE PALE. Ew, ew, ew. 




 Not Grodd, G- oh, wait, nevermind. 




 Many - indeed, most shows - do in fact end on a giant cliffhanger. They want to make sure you tune in in several months.

*Do you have any idea of any concept of time? time doesn't just break*

No, and you can't go into the past either. Except that this is fiction and you can, and time can do whatever the heck the writers want because they're making it all up. 




 He said 136 years, but really, lots of people say lots of things. 




 Speedforce? 




 It's sorta going by the parallel timelines rule, and it's sorta going by the timey wimey rule, and in this particular instance it's definitely going by the back to the futures rule. 




 These are people who don't understand *locks*. Simple logic and probability is equally out of their reach. 




 Jay Garrick hates Eobard and wanted to kill him (or arrest him, or beat him up) and so Eobard decided to get while the getting's good? 




 I did *not* anticipate that ending.

On the one hand, wow, I was shocked and crying at Eddie's sacrifice.

On the other hand, I really liked Eddie. I don't know that I want him to be dead.

On the other other hand, even people with little knowledge of comics know that dead people come back all the time. 




 I didn't see that. I'll have to rewatch later :) 




 Oddly, the only Q episodes I actually *enjoy* are the ones on Voyager. The rest... meh at best, rage at worst. 




 While you're on your do-gooder streak, don't forget to let people know about those girls in Cleveland. 




 Yeah, it is, but I think Clive has the capacity to be pragmatically rational about the whole thing. Once he gets over the initial squick factor. 




 Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.  




 Well, we already knew that bodily fluids would do it. 




 Now, if only there was a rational reason. Creepy and yuck. Seriously, who *does* that? There is a *limit*, man. 




 That's exactly why she dumped him, she mopes about it for a while. 




 Oooh, whatshisface is zombiefied? WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED? Now I guess the only thing to ask is this pre-creepy bloodlicking or post? 




 Fuck, you called it! Good job! 




 Gosh I hope so. 




 Yes. 




 How else is she supposed to do it? It's not like those people need them anymore, anyway. It's like organ donation. 




 No, don't, you'll get zombie cooties. 




 Thank you, Ravi, for initiating The Talk with Liv. You keep pressing that point... although, in fairness, unlike in a certain other CW series I could mention this season, Liv managed to make a logical point about why she thinks ignorance may be safer.

Edit: You know, Clive's pretty smart. They could benefit by bringing him in as well. And maybe Clive could help them convince Major. 




 Your point *is invalid* because you are *not correct*. Many people who went west had no intention of settling  and *all* of them were implicitly going to wage war on the existing inhabitants. Many of those people brought their families. Nitpicking word choice and saying "you made a mistake so you're wrong" is almost as childish as downvoting people who disagree with you. I may as well say "your point is wrong because there is no such thing as the "*oregan" trail." 

You can keep repeating "they all went to settle, they all went to settle, they all went to settle" at the top of your little lungs, but it's not going to make that statement any more true.

Furthermore, even if that had been the intent of every single emigrant who went west - so what? It is not morally better to put your child at risk because you want to "settle" than because you want to "explore". If you're trying to make that claim, you need to have some sort of argument to back it up. And, to be clear, an argument is not "settling isn't exploring! settling isn't waging war!" You need to provide some basis for why the two activities are morally different. (And it *was* waging war, ffs, so, again, that argument is utterly invalid. Why the heck do you think there are so many forts along the Oregon Trail?) 




 I'm not missing your point. I'm saying I *disagree* with it. Contrary to what you might believe, when two people disagree it is not always because one doesn't understand the other.

Among other things, your point is invalid because not every settler who went west - even those who brought their families - had any intention of "settling new territory". Many of them planned to go out for a time and then come back and had no intent to "make a new home". Your analogy is false. An argument based on that analogy fails at the start. 




 Not all of them actually planned to "settle" and "colonize". You'd be surprised how many just intended to make a quick buck and go home - and yes, many of them still either brought their kids with them or made more while they were out there!

And they *all* knew the risks of the behavior and the high child mortality rate. Choosing to go from London to America with your children, or from New York to Utah or Oregon (back in the earlier days of those movements), was putting those children's lives in more than usual danger, and their parents absolutely knew it. They made their choice. It's not like it's somehow a more responsible act to increase your kid's chance of premature death if you plan to settle than if you just plan to explore. The end result is the same.

Really, what *is* the child mortality rate for Federation children being raised on starships? I don't know. Do you? My guess is it isn't much higher than that of children raised on planets - and it's much lower than that of people on the freaking Oregon Trail. 




 Well, if you accept that the last two books exist. 




 If you're not interested in having a serious discussion about TV shows, why are you here? No sarcasm, I'm actually quite curious. If you don't want to take it seriously, you don't have to, but you're not going to get very far responding to somebody who is having fun doing just that with "it's just a TV show". 




 And many of them had to wage war to survive (kinda goes with the territory when you're the invaders) and many more didn't survive. 




  Did Lewis and Clark bring 4-year-old children with them on their expedition? Did Magellan? Would it be a good idea?

Sacajawea did. And yes, while 4 is a little young, children Wesley's age and younger were employed on exploratory vessels and warships when Columbus and Magellan were sailing around the world. We speak of "men" serving on those ships, but by our standards many of them were *boys*. It wasn't that uncommon for them to still be in their single digits, only eight or nine years old.

http://www.thepeacefulsea.com/life-at-sea.html

 If I had my kids aboard the Enterprise, I'd sure be getting them off at the next starbase after the auto-destruct countdown in Where Silence Has Lease. Imagine telling your children they were going to die (or not telling them) and getting down to just a few seconds... for a normal person, that would be a traumatizing experience, but for the Enterprise crew (and civilians, and children) that's just Tuesday.

So you stay home, and because "home" is a colony in the Borg's path, you all get assimilated.

Or you don't, but the Dominion invades and you lose everything.

Or the sun explodes and you all die.

Or somebody is really pissed about the sun thing, so he goes back in time, comes to your world and, logically, pays you back by destroying your sun. (Man, what a stupid thing to do. Why not give Romulus a head's up so they can begin fixing the problem before it starts? Well, I guess that's why the baddy wasn't a Vulcan.)

Or your kid likes to play Parisi Squares, and they get into an accident and die.

Or a visiting alien brings a disease they picked up on some other planet, something undetectable and with a long incubation rate, but highly contagious, and everybody dies. (Don't think I pulled this one from an existing ST plot, so don't ask.)

The point is, there are no guarantees in life. Death comes *unexpectedly*, that's kinda the whole point. You think it's gonna hit you on the Enterprise, so you decide to go sightseeing on Earth, but it turns out it's waiting for you in Samarra the whole time. Whoops.  You can't really be safe, no matter where you go. 




 You are by far the most useful bot I've yet encountered.  




 DS9 has the "arc-based" storytelling that we're used to nowadays, the other series are much more episodic in nature. For that reason, I for one find it an easier watch than the other series, in which every episode unrealistically has a reset button and they always seem to end on a joke no matter how many hapless ensigns have been killed by the space monster or the cunningly disguised social allegory *this* week. (Yes, this is a hugely broad brush I'm painting with. I'm not actually intending to insult anybody's favorite Trek. Each series has its good points and its low points, its shining episodes and its clunkers.)

However, if you're going to *start* with DS9 you'll miss some of the references that you're expected to just know. Might as well go watch Babylon 5, right? 

Sooooo, even though TNG is not my favorite series by a long shot (notwithstanding the fact that Patrick Stewart is terrific in every part he ever plays ever), I'd say start with that. Just feel free to skip over any episode, especially in the first couple of seasons, that is excessively stupid or cheesy. If you're still cringing after the first ten minutes, read the synopsis at Memory Alpha and move on. 




 There's some overlap. 




 Well, not usually. Breeding is a form of evolution and it is "goal directed", but people tend to forget that. 




 Correct word, though not commonly used in American English, we might say "a laugh" or just "it is also hilarious". (But most of us know what the word means, so you're fine. This isn't criticism, it's language geekery.) 
























 Unimatrix 0 probably would make a more interesting TV show than Unimatrix 351. 




 While hiding in the grass giggling? It could happen! 




 That's because they usually do it backwards. Instead of plotting it out and then writing the scripts to fit the arc, they write the scripts, through in a whole bunch of "mysterious" elements and arc-seeds, and then try to get it to all fit together by the end, hopefully wrapping up all the storylines.  




 Can they really? Huh. I did not know that. 




 Yes, remember that episode where the Doctor had a holofamily and learned the moral lesson that real people can't just shut off their lives like a game of The Sims to avoid pain and then *never visited his holofamily again*? His son was hanging out with Klingon friends and listening to god-awful popular adolescent Klingon music. 




 What, *seriously*? Clearly, I have been avoiding TNG at my peril. (I admit it, it's not my favorite Trek, and I've yet to watch the whole thing from start to finish. But I'm sure we can all get along.) 




 Given the state of Sesame Street today, maybe our society IS stagnating. I like to pretend that show ended a few decades ago.  




 Well, that's pointless. Most of the Federation is not part of Starfleet. Not all spaceflight is contracted through Starfleet either. How are those people protected if the great mass of all spacefarers can do whatever they like?

Unless Data meant, perhaps, that "The Prime Directive" applies to Starfleet, but civilians have laws in that area as well? That seems like the excessively pedantic thing he'd do. 




 Flotter might prove the OP's point. Samantha Wildman played (experienced?) Flotter holonovels as a child, and now her daughter is doing the same.

Then again, parents frequently want their kids to read and watch things that are one generation or more behind the times, what they themselves grew up with. 




 Is that officially stated anywhere? 




 Nothing. Remember why they wouldn't intervene directly during the Occupation? What Cardassia did on Bajor was officially considered an internal problem and none of their business.

My guess is that within recognized Federation space they put up warning beacons or some such stating that no contact is allowed and violators will be charged with a crime, but they may not be able to enforce that outside of more heavily populated regions of space, and there's nothing they can do for pre-warp cultures in neutral territory or otherwise outside of the Federation, even if the planet happens to have been surveyed by a Federation ship first.

But it's possible they have some sort of treaty with the other major players regarding who "owns" surveyed planets that aren't clearly in one group's territory, where the one who is in control of the planet (possibly by being the first one to register that they've surveyed it - this is all my thinking as I type on what would be the most likely approach) gets to make the rules. 




 Alternative answer: Earth is currently going through a fad for history and past cultures. (We have no idea if this trend is widespread through the Federation. All your examples are of humans.) Everything old is new again, and in another two decades the fashion will be to be stunningly up-to-date and profess ignorance of history.

Alternative two: Like before, except that it's not "Earth" it's just "Starfleet", perhaps under the influence of a couple of prominent captains and admirals, such as Picard, that everybody wants to emulate and that happen to have an interest in the past. (Except it's too obvious to be obsessed with Shakespeare and classical music and jazz because Picard is your hero and Riker is your runner-up, or baseball because you've read everything you can on Sisko who is SO awesome, so instead you focus on rock music or Cold War spy dramas or the Alamo or, I don't know, King Arthur.) It's "cool" to have an esoteric interest in the past, and the more individualized, the better. 




 If the ending did happen, I like to imagine Kara just ducked behind a tall strand of grass and giggled her butt off when they started looking for her. 




 I am doing something about it. I'm supporting this proposal. Hey! 




  A city is already a highly disrupted environment. With current technology, it can't be a low-human impact environment no matter what you do.

Indeed, but the light pollution from a city impacts rural land for a *long* way out. Light pollution, by its nature, is not compact or concentrated.

Additionally, as pointed out, there are real health risks. Do you know that women who live where they can read outside at midnight have a 78% greater chance of developing breast cancer than those who live where there is little light pollution? 




 I don't know if it is firmly established in canon that the military and Obsidian Order are typical of all Cardassians everywhere. I wouldn't base my opinions of Americans on our CIA and Marines, you know?

But let's say they are more backstabby in general. As you say, their backstabbing takes the form of "active betrayal for the benefit of themselves and their family". Humans aren't immune to that! (Equinox, amiright? Also, who the heck is behind these names? A ship named Voyager goes on a long Voyage. A ship named "equal night" does evil things. A ship named Defiant defies the Dominion. What's next, a ship named Lollipop? That'd be a good ship!) But Seska doesn't do that. Seska betrays everybody just 'cuz she can.  




 I suppose it would be interesting to have the bad guys win for good for a change. Might make the rest of the season a little depressing, though. They'd have to change the title from Star Trek: Voyager to Borg Collective: Unimatrix 351.

Now I can't get the thought of Borg television out of my head. Actually, that would be interesting. We know so little about what the Borg do other than assimilate people and, in the case of the Queen, be creepily sexually frustrated. 




 Tim Russ acted the hell out of that job, but there isn't much character development or range when you're playing an excessively straight-up and literal-minded interpretation of a Vulcan. 




 Is it? We see a wide range of Cardassian personalities on DS9 - Cardassians who wish to force their people to recognize the crimes committed on Bajor, Cardassians who want to institute democratic reforms, Cardassian soldiers who are stolid and unemotional and lacking that certain creativity needed to engage in productive backstabbing (that's Damar)....

Tangent: Now that I think about it, DS9 is as much about the Cardassians as it is about Bajorans.

The two Cardassians we see the most are Dukat and Garak. I'll tackle Garak first.

Obviously, Garak is capable of backstabbing people with aplomb. I'll take it as given that this goes with the territory when you're a member of the Obsidian Order. I'll *not* take it as given that every Cardassian is equally capable of being a member of said order, no more than every human and Vulcan is capable of being a member of Section 31. However, on the show, how often do we really see him backstabbing people? And when we do see it, do we *ever* see him doing this just because he had a whim to do so? If you ask me, the one defining feature of Garak is his steadfast loyalty to his people and his willingness to suffer to improve things for Cardassia. That's his own never-ending sacrifice. If he does betray people, he does it for what he has determined is a good cause - not just because it seems like fun.

Then there's Dukat. And Dukat is so backstabby that his own superior officers didn't trust him not to flee if the station got blown up. Good call. But two things. First, Dukat is crazy - and if that episode where he hallucinates proves anything, it proves that he's been crazy a *long* time. The hallucinations might be new, but they're just gravy. Secondly, even Dukat doesn't just backstab everybody just for the lulz. Consider his relationship with Kira. He promised her mother that he'd look out for her children. Pragmatically speaking, he didn't have to keep that promise. Really, what was the woman gonna do if he violated it, complain? But not only did he keep it, but he continued to keep it (according to the novels anyway) after her death. Kira may be right that Dukat is a selfish bastard who doesn't know what love is, but he certainly made the effort. Or consider Ziyal - actually, let's consider Ziyal in a separate paragraph.

Ziyal is a sweet, friendly young woman who couldn't backstab an armadillo. Yes, you're thinking, but she was half Bajoran and raised Bajoran. Consider the years in the slave camp, though. The other Cardassians freely warned her that her father might not save her. They didn't betray her, they gave her useful advice. And when her father *does* decide to bring her home, he sticks with her, even though this does him no favors with his family. Dukat clearly has the capability to refrain from casual sociopathy.

Now, let's look at Seska. Seska backstabs everybody all over the place, and for what purpose? Her actions have no chance of gaining her anything, and she keeps doing it even as they make her position more and more precarious. FFS, when Chakotay told Janeway that little parable about the scorpion and the frog, he wasn't talking about the Borg, he meant Seska! The Borg were more reliable than her!

If Seska had sought to improve her situation without considering how it affected others, that would be at least consistent with the more backstabby Cardassians we see, such as Dukat. But she just betrayed people for kicks! Stupid and pointless. Not the hallmarks of a compelling character, and not a terribly convincing portrayal of the Cardassian mindset either. 




 We all have to make sacrifices for the greater good. 




 No, instead they had their fairy tale ending with deities. Or something. Not really sure.... 




 Paying people is contrary to his utopian vision of Federation economy. 




 Except for that last season. Ugh, what *was* that? 




 And Seska. A Cardassian infiltrator rightly disliked and distrusted by both sides, forced to stick it out with them anyway on the chance of getting home in 70 years - that could've been interesting.

Instead, she was just another Cardassian infected by chronic backstabbing syndrome.  




 There are multiple benefits to reducing light pollution, as listed upthread.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627884/

 If you see it as such a big priority, and if it is really so easy, why don't you so it for them? If you pay for it out of pocket and handle the installation, I'm sure plenty of buildings would be more than happy for you to install some energy saving equipment.

Whatever happened to personal responsibility? 




 Nope, the lamest thing you can do is insulting others based on them "residing on the first floor of a tenement", whether or not that happens to be true. 




 Whole spices last longer and are generally a better investment. I also generally find they're less expensive because I am more able to buy them in bulk, however, ymmv. (I use a dedicated coffee grinder if I need them ground.) 




 Okay, so when you shine lights all around and it affects my health and the environment and my ability to see the stars, that's the free society. But when the government says "shut down the lights if you're not using them", that's "butting into people's lives"?

So you can butt into my life, but the government can't butt into yours, is that it? 




   No one would pay New York any mind if it weren't for its built form and buildings

That's a completely ridiculous assertion and you know it.

But if it's true - I say, bring it on! Let's ditch all the fucking tourists! (And, as a bonus, we get to get rid of *you*. Win-win all around, I say.) 




 I can't stand that "warm orange glow". Makes me feel like I'm walking around in an oddly colored horror flick. 




 It's not enough to use LEDs, you also have to design the lights so the light goes directly down and very little is directed sideways or up.

Having the lights on a motion sensitive dimmer might also help - say, if they were dim normally, but brightened up a little when a person car went under them. But I don't know how feasible that upgrade would be. 




 Indeed. Incidentally, I believe that when referring to Deaf culture, one uses a capital letter. 









 Marco's Millions. It's the prequel to The Boxes. 




 Good for you. For a while, no joke, paperback was hovering in the $80s. 









 It goes for an insane price at Amazon, or at least it did last time I bought a copy. 




 It's been sixteen days. Are the weeks longer on Bajor? 




 Sure, there are more of those jobs now - but nearly all the job growth since the recession has been in low-wage service industry jobs. Jobs that people will quite blithefully declare "don't deserve" a living wage to do.

Our society will take decades to adjust to post-scarcity economics. By the time it reaches us, I'll be dead of old age. In the interim, things are gonna *suck*.  




 I didn't ask for a list of jobs, I asked which ones are in the list of most common jobs in America.

http://www.ranker.com/list/most-common-jobs-in-america/american-jobs

None of your list are on the list of most common jobs in America. Since the recession, nearly all job growth has been in low wage service industry jobs - not in computer *anything*. 




 No, not based on reality. I think you're either making this up wholesale, or heavily exaggerating, because the statistics - as compared to your anecdata - says that there's no such thing. 




 That, in a nutshell, is why I buy Orson Scott Card's books *used*.

My rule of thumb is that if I'm pretty sure they're still doing whatever terrible thing it is (or would still be doing it if they had the chance), then I won't financially support them. If they've stopped doing it (or are dead), then so long as the art itself doesn't glorify rape or abuse, I'm okay with it. Other people will have different personal approaches, and that's all right too. 




 Well, unless the Deaf activists all set out for their own colony where they can preserve Deaf culture in perpetuity. 

...like that novel Blindsight, but with less of a dystopian vibe, and without the blindness. 




 Welfare queens are a myth. They don't exist in any sort of actual numbers. They never did. 




 Perhaps like in that extremely preachy DS9 two parter where they go back in time and the captain replaces a rioter? 




 It's a city, not a corporation. It doesn't have or need a "brand". The city is made by people, not buildings. 




  If it were recessive, wouldn't that mean that squibs cannot be born to two magical parents?

Not necessarily. It might be that a certain "squib gene" blocks magic in individuals that would otherwise have had it. 




 Oh, I think dimming the lights certainly will have an impact, as will improving our street lighting. 

And why should we leave the skyline alone? Are you also suggesting we should never put up new buildings, as those affect the skyline? Or that we should never tear down old or decrepit ones?

Keeping the skyline as is to appease one dude on reddit seems like a very silly notion. 




 Why not? 




 Light pollution interferes with our ability to view the night sky (so anybody interested in astronomy cares), disrupts ecosystems (so environmentalists care), and has health effects (so anybody human either cares or ought to care). 




 No such thing is required in any state, although IDs may be required for certain activities, such as driving, buying various controlled substances, and voting. 




 Then they lied to you. 10% of Americans do not have any form of legal identification. They are not breaking any national or state law.

Some people will say any old thing. 

http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2014/02/do-you-have-to-carry-id-with-you-at-all-times.html  




 Yes, with the right documents. And what if they can't obtain those documents? What if they can't get to the DMV? What if they don't have the fee? 




 Would you kill your daughter if she got pregnant? Would you kick her out of the home? Would you exile her to Tranquility Bay? Would you lock her in her room and deny her all contact outside the family until she turned 18, and *then* kick her out and not pay for any form of education or support?

Oh, no? Well, then you're not the reason young women need to be able to make this decision without parental input if necessary. 




 You don't need to show an ID to get medical treatment. If you show up to the hospital with a broken bone, but you're one of the 10% of Americans without an ID, they don't just send you home. 




 10% of adult American citizens do not have an ID. The trouble is that once you're in that hole, it's hard to gather the points of identification needed to get an ID, because many of those things are not available without an ID. If this sounds Kafkaesque, that's because it is. 




 Maybe we can be the biggest and the best at *not being wasteful*. We can take pride in having *visible stars*. 




   When the personal computing revolution happened, a lot of jobs were made obsolete, and yet many new jobs were created through the economic growth that computers have driven

Most of those jobs seem to have been in trucking. A great number of other jobs were in low-wage fields such as cashiering and waitressing. How many genuinely *new* jobs are common nowadays? Say, in the top 50 list.

I can name one - software engineer. 




 What new occupations have been opened up in the past decade? 

 Ideally with enough automation, no one would need to have a job to sustain a comfortable lifestyle anyway. 

Post scarcity is gonna be great, sure... if we all survive the interim which is filled with people saying "If they don't work, they don't eat" and acting like this is compassion. 



















































































































































































 I'm thinking about it. 







































 These are people who have apparently never heard of locks. It takes a special kind of person to work in STAR Labs. 














 Yup. I'd love it more if Liv spoke to other female recurring characters more than once every other episode. 




 Stupidity. Sheer, crushing stupidity. 




 Sure, why not? 




 Kinda has to be. How many authors have the initials V. V. V.? 



















 No wonder that customer said the visions were "boring"! 




 Like in Heroes...? 



















 Have you read the article? Because it certainly is explained therein. 




  the difference between 6 months and 8 months really isn't a big difference to me or anyone.

At 25 weeks of pregnancy the is a 50% chance at viability with medical assistance in case of a premature birth. At 32 weeks, that chance is at 96%. At 22 weeks, the chance is 0%.

 It's right there in the article that it won't change abortion legality when it comes to certain medical conditions, rape, and incest. That's the point.

Elective abortions are still legal - if rare - at 21 weeks. And don't forget that in addition to the closing of abortion clinics throughout the US, many states have mandatory "waiting periods" between when you go in to get an abortion and when you are able to have it done. Those can push you closer to the 20 week mark. 

It's not terribly uncommon for a woman to not know she's pregnant until three or four months. My own mother didn't know she was pregnant with me until four months, because she was traveling and she always had a late period when traveling! Women who have irregular periods are especially prone to not realizing that *this* time it's late because of a pregnancy. 















































































 Abortion and also the most effective forms of birth control, because those "might" really be abortions in disguise (even though all the science indicates that they're not). 




 Elective abortions at eight or nine months aren't legal, so I don't see what you're arguing about. The only abortions at that point are when the fetus is already dead, or has a condition incompatible with life that puts the mother at risk if she tries to carry to term anyway.

You're creating a false connection between "abortions at 21 weeks" (rare, but legal, and generally for medical reasons instead of elective reasons) and "abortions at 8 months" (not legal except where medically indicated). That's like if a vegan shows up and tries to claim that my eating some fried chicken is *exactly the same* as my eating elephant steaks because, you know, elephants are an endangered species and highly intelligent. 




 Yes, you'd probably know, but in many states there is only one abortion clinic. A poor woman might need time to gather up money and resources to get over there and have it done. 






























































































  I trust the immune system I was born with.

Most of the dead children in this world were born with that same immune system, but they still got a now-preventable disease and still died. 




 Yeah, but the one big one is a *doozy*. 




   From a completely practical standpoint, there are not many reasons to own a physical media collection.

Nobody can delete or alter your DVDs and printed books without your consent. 




 I'd rather spill oil or extract or milk on a cookbook than on an ipad. 






























































































 Mostly because I think it has a lot of good lines, and also it doesn't make me cringe in embarrassment the way some of the other light-hearted ones do. DS9 doesn't do light-hearted very well. 




 Yup. And he didn't have to do it. He could've said "Hey, listen, since Kira will die if she goes to the past, and she's not strictly necessary for this colony to exist, why doesn't she stay here with all the tech you're not bringing with you?" 




 Except it doesn't make much sense. Since Kira dies without descendents, it's not necessary for her to go back in time. They'd already offloaded all their junk that hadn't survived the original accident (but that the colony might need), so why not offload Kira as well?
 




 Well, he kept winning the Alamo. 




 And it worked! Q never came back! I bet Picard wishes now he'd thought of *that* little maneuver. 




 Which is admittedly the best of the silly non-Ferengi episodes. 




 Nah, Harry's death was worse, because it didn't stick. 









 Is it?  

















































 You'd be amazed how often you have to explain what most means. 

Now that you've been exposed to "on accident" you'll probably hear it everywhere. That's what happened to me the first time I found out about "If you *would have* done this and that" where I would say "If you *had* done" and so on. 




 Wasn't he hiking the Appalachian Trail? 




 Thanks, will delete. 




 Here I am in NYC, where I've lived nearly my whole life, and I hear it frequently from the younger crowd, and back when I was the younger crowd (early 30s here) I heard it occasionally from people my age and younger.

But of course, when I say that it's heavily weighted towards the younger end of the population, I don't mean "all kids and teens say this", just "it's much more common with kids and teens and young adults than it is with older adults". Like if I say "most new yorkers don't have a car" and you *do* have a car (well, you don't, because you can't drive until you're 18 in the city, but you know what I mean) you're not doing it wrong, you're just in the minority. 



















 Sure - and other subs function very well where they aren't. 




 I do, actually. That's just how I roll. 




 But comments have two options, an upvote option and a downvote option. Arbitrarily asking us to ignore one of those options is ridiculous. 




 Of course there is. On accident is heavily weighted towards the younger end of the population. Older folks more usually say *by* accident.

Associated with younger people = ignorant and stupid. 















































































































































































































































 Finally watched it.

Liv, tell him *again*. You already did it once, and sure, you were hallucinating, but you based your hallucination on a real person. He's already primed, you just have to ease into your explanation. 




 Well, that's it. We didn't expect *two* hallucinatory friends! 




 The closed captioning had her saying "That's me", but I guess that line was cut. 




 Okay, well, as we don't know when your friend was in the 6th grade that's not very helpful. What year was this? 




 God, it's gotten to the point where I can no longer distinguish between people saying that sarcastically and people saying it sincerely. 




 Definitely, the Pit Dragon Trilogy. (There is technically a fourth book. It is not worth the paper it's printed on. I re-read all three of the previous in preparation for book 4, but I don't believe Yolen bothered to do the same.) 




 It's a pretty good book. 




 That evil space station episode makes no sense. Who made it? Why did they make it? Why not use a more conventional power source? Why does nobody seriously ask these questions? 




 Hogfather, of course. 




 Yeah, they're called pigeons. Or sparrows, or crows. 




 It's a bot, isn't it?

Of course, he does primarily fight blind and blindfolded boxers. 




 I'm not 100% certain that I'd want to walk the mile from 59th to 34th in bad or cold or hot weather, just because it's technically in the same area. It's two train stops (edit: guesstimate), and my *guess* is that the train, with your ability to not get hit by a car, might be a bit safer for a blind person than the streets. (I'm just guessing, though.) 


































 We don't read the comments, that's how. 




 Climate change is a huge contributing factor to the Syrian civil war.  




 I can only assume Quark uses replicators to deal with those weirdly shaped mugs. Can you imagine trying to clean those? 




 That's got to count as cruel and unusual, though. 




 Well, Dukat certainly does. 




 I'm sorry for your loss. 




 This pair of statistics sounds shocking, but there's a possible explanation. 

The population which got a second opinion comes from the 30% of Americans who don't feel confident in their doctor's advice and do see a need to gather additional information. 

We don't know what the results would be if the 70% who trust their doctors got second opinions. It might be the same, or it might not. 




 (Thanks!) 




 Train stations have [blind people bumps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_paving), so he's safe on the MTA! And it's only a short train trip to 34th street, where I know for a fact that the Loews has audio description. (I was there ten days ago for my niece's birthday. Thank *god*, she's old enough that we didn't have to sit through the movie with her. I claimed poverty and went to the bookstore instead.) 




 Wait - tuna fish is turning some people to stone? (Real world question, is this a comics thing?) 




  Also, wouldn't you be at least a little upset if you knew that your body (or the body of your SO, parent, or sibling) was free for anyone to do anything with after they die?

No, I wouldn't. They're not there. They're dead. Their body is just so much meat. To me, this is like asking "Wouldn't you be at least a little upset if you knew that your house (or your mom's house) was free for anyone to do anything with after you move?" Why should I care? I've moved! So you can repaint in colors I hate, or screw in what used to be the nursery, or tear the whole thing to the ground for all I care.

What's the alternative? Stick the body in the ground until the worms and maggots devour it? Leave it on top of the ground for the vultures to eat, a so-called "sky burial"? Or burn it to a crisp and then deal with the cremains? They aren't just ashes, there are bone fragments, and prior to burning any internal devices, such as pacemakers, have to be removed.

Nothing that happens to the body after death is pretty. Thankfully, we're no longer there to experience it. My body isn't who I am, it's just where I live. 




 In the Paralympics, yes, but blind fighters such as wrestlers can and do compete with sighted opponents.

http://blindsports.on.ca/sports/wrestling/

Some sports are easier to accommodate for visual impairments than others. 




 The Edge Chronicles. I don't know which book in that series it's from, but it's from that series. 




 Theaters nowadays do offer audio description on movies. 




 With Braille Playing Cards.

 She would have mentioned if she had friends? So would Ron, I imagine. Given that Harry was still meeting people in his own house or year as late as OotP, it's entirely possible she did mention friends and Harry just didn't notice and so we never got wind of it.

I'm sure she didn't have that many friends, because her social skills are really poor, but Harry is an amazingly blinkered individual when it comes to other people. 




 Do you remember the first book? Vernon's scared of *Petunia*. She's the one with the abiding hatred at that point. People have this fanon that Vernon's the driver in all this, but it's not backed up by facts. 




 Dumbledore doesn't really get people, though. I mean, this is the guy who thought it was appropriate to inform a woman of her sister's death via a baby and a *note*. I don't care if they *were* estranged, that's the sort of thing that merits a personal visit! 




   Have you noticed Hermione didn't seem to have any muggle friends before going to hogwarts?

Why, because she never mentions them? Does that mean Dean had no muggle friends? Neville and Seamus and Ron had had no friends of any sort? 

 No they are nice people, she goes skiing with them in Paris and things like that during the summer.

Skiing's not really her thing.

I have no idea what sort of people the Grangers might be, but I really dislike it when people assume that superficial things - like going on vacation with your child - mean that you're a good person or a good parent. Plenty of people who are subpar parents or actually abusive take those kids skiing and whatnot, for lots of them it's more important to *look* like a good parent to others than to *be* a good parent to their child.

(That doesn't mean that the fact they took her skiing makes them BAD parents. It means that the skiing and the vacations are no proof one way or another.) 




 Do they? We hardly even see them in the books... and to be honest, I have trouble thinking too highly of people who blithely send their daughter to live with a boy during vacations after she's been away at boarding school the entire year.

They could be nice people. They could be emotionally distant. They could be abusive. They could be giant stuffed cabbages for all we know. 




 I completely agree. I'll add to this the fact that, over the course of seven years, she spends less and less time each year with her family at home and more and more of her vacation time with the Weasleys. Hermione is not so subtly trying to distance herself from her roots, and it shows. 




 Never can tell what people know and don't.

And that's nothing. After *years* of carefully avoiding all mention of two girls, one cup I finally had to sit through two kids talking about it on the bus. Never in my life wanted so hard to reach over and smack somebody. 




 I asked why he wouldn't be good at touch typing, and you responded that he didn't have an incentive to learn. I think one of us misunderstood the other, and that's not a snide way of saying "you misunderstood me". 




 Results from the recent past can be a little more illuminating than results from the more distant past. Right now there has been little job growth outside of the service industry. That doesn't bode well for the "well, they make more jobs in the long run!" mindset.

And while I, too, look forward to our inevitable post-scarcity paradise (well, assuming we don't hit the equally inevitable climate-change fueled dystopian horrorland instead, and yes, I know what inevitable is supposed to mean :P), the years between now and then are gonna *suck* as we transition to new assumptions and ways of living. 




 That's a funny definition of "normal". By that definition, it's not normal to be against marriage equality, because you are most definitely in the minority.  




 There, there. Happens to the best of us. 




 Okay, this is not terribly likely, but maybe Zahrah the Windseeker?

If you have any other details, no matter how trivial, they can help. 




 A greater number of people report having had same-sex experiences than call themselves gay or bisexual.

Conclusion? Surveys that rely on self-reporting aren't as accurate as you might hope. We still don't know the real number, although we do know it's greater than .5%. 




 That's been the case before, but past results are no guarantee of future success. 




 Do you remember when you read it? 




 Straight people have anal sex too.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/06/anal-sex-heterosexual-couples-report_n_1190440.html

A sizable minority of straight men and women have engaged in anal sex. It really is normal human behavior.

You and I aren't alike. I don't have a prurient fascination with other people's sex lives. That really isn't normal human behavior. 




 More than 50% of the US population approves of marriage equality, and that number is rising.

https://xkcd.com/1431/

You're in the minority, I'm happy to say. 




 Do you even *know* any blind people? Because the blind people I know, even those older than Daredevil, use computers all the time. Heck, most of 'em I met *online*. (Most of my friends are people I know online, you know how it is.)

Blind people have just as much incentive to be independent as sighted people - especially those blind people who also happen to be *lone vigilantes*. 



















 Why wouldn't he be good at touch typing? It's not a difficult skill to learn. 









 Can we please not juxtapose "gays" and things being "shoved down our throats"? It's just such an awkward combination and certain parties use it *all the time*. In the case of the homophobes, it's probably freudian somehow. 




 Whatever happened to not taking the bait? 




 Mmm. It's certainly true that less than 4% of the US population self-identifies as gay or bisexual in surveys.

However, that doesn't mean that less than 4% of the US population feels any same-sex attraction.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orientation

Dealing with self-reporting can give you odd results if people feel a pressure to identify as straight.  




 Oh, bless your heart, you are *so* oppressed, you poor thing!  




 There've been a lot of them on HGTV for well over a decade by now. My mother used to joke about it. If a couple came on that wasn't interracial she'd be "OMG! They're the SAME!"  




 (s)na(rt). 




 Gosh who doesn't? 




 I suppose that's part of the gay agenda too. "If you don't accept your children, they'll become SUPERVILLAINS."

Which would be much cooler than what frequently does happen to gay and trans kids whose parents can't accept them. 




 Some people do that, especially if they've been dating awhile before the engagement 




 1/7 of the US population is in an interracial marriage, and yet when that adorable Cheerios commercial came out, omg the idiotic outcry. 




 It didn't seem terribly forced to me. Replay it in your head. If he'd said his "girlfriend" or "wife" wanted him to eat healthy, you'd consider it a throwaway line and probably not even notice. 




 And it wasn't even a big thing. She asked, they answered, and it was *done*. 




   But damn, some people treat it as if any mention of sexism/racism/homophobia is this blatant attack on everything they know and love.

That's because deep inside, they liked it better when everything they knew and loved was bigoted as heck.

It's like the people who whine about "PC" and when you look at the specific thing they can't stand it's nothing more than *good manners*. 




 Oh, yeah.

http://www.evula.com/jokes/homosexual_agenda.html 




 Wait, did you really not know about that before? 




 A minor character mentions his fiance, what, three times and this is being "forced" on you?

Sounds to me like you're the one with an agenda. 




 Gotta love how these folks always think that having nothing but straight people (or nothing but non-interracial couples, or nothing but whites, or nothing but men, or whatever it is they're whining about *this* week) isn't pushing an agenda at all. 




 There was a bit of an outcry when Netflix released Daredevil without audio description - and Netflix *did* know this kind of thing exists, because people have been asking them for over a decade to include it on some of their programming.

As with closed captioning, some providers are required by law to produce a certain amount of programming every year with audio description. Netflix's argument was that they are not included in that law (that was the same argument they used about CC until they settled out of court), but after the media around Daredevil they have agreed to add audio description to some of their shows and movies, including Daredevil.

It costs between $2,000 and $8,000, IIRC, to provide audio description for one hour of scripted entertainment. 




 Blind people can use the internet. Why wouldn't they?

 Ouch! Do you correct them when you hear them, or walk on by? I'm frequently bit by the pedantry bug, and just cannot resist the urge. (Which I'm aware makes me probably a jerk, but I can live with that.) 




 And you don't know the half of it. Needless to say, I was more than willing to never see him again. 




 Our mutual dislike was so great that when I had him again he pretty much immediately suggested I do self-study instead and report in to an entirely different teacher to boot! 




 Demons, spirits, afterlives, none of that have any bearing on whether or not there are deities.

If you define "gods" as "beings who can do things I cannot do", then by that definition Superman is a god. Heck, so is my *cat*. She can see in the dark. (Of course, she's terribly nearsighted, like all cats, but such is life.)

Perhaps you define it as "beings who can do things I can't do and also can't explain". My cat is off the pantheon, Superman is still on. I sure as heck can't explain how that dude can leap tall buildings in a single bound *without* leaving giant holes in the pavement every time he lifts off.

Merriam-Webster defines "god" as follows:

a being or object believed to have more than natural attributes and powers and to require human worship; specifically :  one controlling a particular aspect or part of reality 

I suppose that does knock out Superman (finally), but it still leaves the field marvelously open with all sorts of beings that aren't conventionally considered deities of any sort.

Additionally, even if you acknowledge that deities exist, it doesn't follow that you acknowledge that you, personally, ought to worship them.  




 Audio description? 




 I can never unsee that. 




 I know the term, but I couldn't give you a precise definition. Caitlin's probably in that group. She has a vague idea, but she wanted more details. 




 The year I graduated high school was 2002. Had a jackass teacher who insisted on calling it 'Ground Hero'.  












































 I don't think so. It looks like price gouging is only illegal in NY during "an unreasonable disruption of the market". Being stuck on line waiting hours to get into the memorial probably doesn't count.

Failing to list prices, now, that may be illegal. Don't know how to google for that. Hold on.

Edit: Yes, it looks like not showing prices is not legal.

 I don't think people *do* have an intrinsic right, actually, to control what happens to their body once they're no longer using it.

And yes, I think you can do pretty much what is necessary to survive so long as you're not hurting anybody else. She isn't. Dead bodies aren't people. There's nothing left there to hurt. 




 She's at an amusement park. She's a customer. The park's sole purpose is to entertain customers. It's not to enforce arbitrary rules. Simply requesting a seating arrangement that makes her more comfortable is ipso facto "unreasonable"? 

I don't subscribe to "the customer is always right", but it seems a poor policy to act as though any request to alter SOP is automatically "unreasonable".

Now, this request may have legitimately *been* unreasonable. Especially if the park was crowded, they may not be able to accommodate repeated seating requests without delaying everybody else and making all their other customers unhappy. But her simply *asking* is not unreasonable. Unless you ask, you don't know what the response will be. 




  Next time I go to Luna Park I'll demand at any congestion stand I'm at not service animal products. I'm sure they'll understand because of my beliefs, right?

This is more like asking if they have veggie dogs than asking them not to serve anybody else meat. 




 Even if they *didn't* respectfully ask, the correct response is "We cannot accommodate that request. If you'd like a refund, I can get a manager."

There's really no excuse for escalating the situation. 




   As I understand it, Muslim women aren't allowed to speak to men that they're not related to (how did they order pizza before seamless? The horror...)

Islam isn't a monolith, and not all Muslims are equally religious. Just like with Christians, for that matter. Some Christians - think the Duggars - won't let their children go on unsupervised dates with their fiances. Others are okay with premarital sex. 

Plenty of observant Muslim women have no problem speaking to unrelated men, and there really are Jewish and Christian women in this country (and not immigrants) who *do*. (Seriously, Christian patriarchy is a real thing.) 




 GB has fewer than 5% of the population being Muslim. Italy and Norway have fewer than 4%. If 4 or 5% of your population is "too many", I suggest it may be the remaining 95% of your population that is "the problem". 




 Yes, asking not to be seated next to a man is *exactly the same* as blowing shit up. 
























 Wait, do they really grow rice in California? That's insane. That cannot be true.

 YOU ARE MISSING OUT.

Seriously, the expression on his face as he eats it is the same as the one on my face when blintzes are half price at the supermarket! (And those aren't even really *good* blintzes!) 




 You can get them in the freezer aisle in a box of 6 for $3. 




 Oh, man, you've never had? Okay, get some applesauce and some sour cream to eat with them. Gonna buy them frozen or try your hand at making them? (I've never made them myself - scared to!) 




 Blintzes are delish, aren't they? 




 Looked like a blueberry blintz to me. 




 In the late 60s.

Well, let's look at the crime stats. These are national - your own area may be more or less safe than this.

http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm

In 1969 there were 7.3 rapes and 18.5 "forcible rapes" for every 100,000 people. In 2013 the numbers were 4.5 and 25.2, respectively - and there's some serious evidence to suggest that rapes haven't increased, but reporting has. (Certainly, the FBI numbers on rape will start to change now that they count rapes of males instead of just of females.)

In some areas, the numbers are slightly higher than they were in 1969. However, they show a marked decrease from the highs in the 1980s and 90s. 

The truth is that the US has been experiencing a decrease in crime for the past decade and a half by now. There are many ideas for why this might be. Me, I favor the lead hypothesis - an increase in leaded gasoline caused low levels of led poisoning in crowded urban areas, which cased an increase in violent crime 20 years down the line, and when we removed lead from gasoline we saw a corresponding decrease 20 years after that. 




 And it's funnier if she doesn't. 




 And then JKR is going "Oh, that's just, you know, innocent stuff!"

Like when you're 12 and realize that ANOTHER word that "starts with f and ends with uck" is "firetruck" and insist on making that joke all the time because, after all, it's "not dirty!" 




 You know, clean? So it doesn't smell bad when you, you know, fuck it? And it's "horn-y"? 









 Bread, a centrum, and also your entire daily dose of sugar in one serving. 









 Yes, good point. 




 Well, the stereotype of rural types is that they, um, screw their livestock. Aberforth keeps goats, so.... 




 Maybe, but wouldn't that take some time to set in, much like the peroxide look? 




 Probably because you're utterly wrong. The average age for marriage in the middle ages in Europe was in the early 20s for both men and women. That's the number that's *everywhere*.

Aristocratic families often married earlier... but they didn't consummate their marriages right away, so it's a moot point. 




 Oh gosh, yeah. The movie was great!  




 Simply "struggling to speak in social situations" isn't autism, it's social anxiety.

Mind, social anxiety is common among autistics (and it's about 50/50 the disabling attitudes of society - being bullied for 12+ years of schooling will do that to a person), but they're not the same thing. 




 Now that you're better, feed yourself and not the troll. 




 Okay, I ask again - do you have a *source* for that? 
































































 Ah, well, don't let me harsh your squee. If you love it, more power to you :) 




 How/why would they *lose* blood?  




 Aaaaaaand then she skipped merrily away from the cop shop and into her DOOM on the advice of a *text message*. Didn't even call up to confirm that the guy on the other end really was who she thought. 




   Season 2 of Veronica Mars is one of my favorite season of any show.

Too bad Season 3 blew it. 




 He's fighting the good fight, him against the world! (I've never been so tempted to cram the word "whilst" into a sentence in my life omg.) 




 Well, I do know that our knowledge of how to treat autistics has improved.

 All I know is that the first one was in much worse shape than the third one.

And there could be many possible causes for this, yet you concluded there was exactly one cause and you knew what it was. 




 Definitely the latter. 




 And it all started at the same age for each of them? And in the 14 years between the first child and the third, therapies didn't improve at all? 




 And did none of them have any treatment or therapy? 




 It's both. 




 Mostly in wealthier areas, where the cops have loads of free time and the neighbors can spend hours sitting at their windows waiting to call them. 




 Geez that's a long-ass trip. 




 When were you a kid? 




  Putting a 10 year old in charge of a 6 year old is definitely neglect.

You can babysit - like an actual infant - at 12 in nearly all jurisdictions. Why not watch your own sibling at 10? 




 From dusk to dawn? Were you vampires? 




 Yeah, it was looked at. Google "refrigerator mother". It's no longer being looked at because all the evidence shows that it's utter bullshit. We don't need to retread old ground here, that hypothesis is as dead and buried as the MMR hypothesis. 




 Interesting that you didn't even think of /r/autism :) 




 Thanks :) 




  Haven't humans traditionally had their first children as teenagers in most cultures?

I don't know, HAS this been the case?

 It seems like I see a lot more children diagnosed with it now days.

That's because you do. However, an increase in diagnosis is not the same as an increase in incidence. 




 To paternal age, and to the age of the paternal grandfather. 




 Your comment is predicated on the false idea that autism is primarily a *social* disorder. 




 The diagnostic criteria for autism changed, significantly, between the DSM-3 and the DSM-4. That's all. If you use the modern criteria and look at adults, you find the same rates among adults as you do among children, it's just that many autistics 20 years ago either got NO diagnosis or got an inappropriate diagnosis such as "mental retardation" or "childhood schizophrenia". 




 Is that the only thing different? Or did she, perhaps, have her children diagnosed earlier each time around, and get them therapy and assistance sooner than their next older sibling had? And that therapy and assistance, over 14 years, was bound to be better as we know more than we did then. 




 Yes, that hypothesis was brought up in the article. 




 You think that "lacking male role models" leads children to have speech delays? Or to be unable to wear clothing with tags or to be unable to be in a room with blinking lights?
 




 How do you know none of their kids are autistic? 




 It's not completely random, in fact. We know already that autism is highly hereditary. 




 Almost certainly, but we don't know that from a single family.

That single family, for example, could have all been exposed to something in utero, or it could just be a freak coincidence. 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5

Indeed, they do diagnose it as ASD nowadays. 




 You're not going to be able to get an Asperger's diagnosis. It's not in the DSM anymore. 




 Yes, and I know a guy who says the secret to living to be 95 like him is to drink like a fish, smoke like a chimney, and never wear a seatbelt.

I'm not taking his advice. 




  So does that mean that in the medieval era where the average bride was like 16 and the groom was like 50 there were higher risk of autism?

Do you have a source for this factoid? 




 No, actually, not only is it not lower in the UK but studies conducted in the UK show that numbers of adult autistics mirror those of young autistics.

However, when you were a child, more "low functioning" autistics were more likely to be institutionalized or at least taught separately and more "high functioning" autistics frequently didn't get a diagnosis of any sort. 




 Yeah, but no. Wakefield didn't have any statistics, he made up the numbers from whole cloth. 




 It is extraordinarily unlikely that at this point autism (discounting Fragile X) will be found to be caused by a single gene. Evidence is pointing to autism, like height, being a multi-gene trait.

 I once worked teaching Autistic kids and most of the parents seemed pretty... uh... off.

Kanner made that same observation, and came to the same conclusion.  




 What does "correct for multiple testing" mean, if you don't mind explaining? 




  Calling everyone an "actor" doesn't sound inherently male, because Actor/Actress isn't Male/Female, it's Vague/Female.

I don't know about that. I wouldn't be surprised to find that some people do find "actor" an inherently male word - not a "vague" word. 




 My mother tells me the story of her first catechism class (which apparently is the initial root of her eventual departure from Catholicism) where the earnest nun told a room full of Puerto Ricans, Italians, and one Walloon girl (my mother), all of whom were bilingual, that history was from "his story".

She was six years old, sitting there looking at the other classmates thinking "No it is NOT", but she didn't know how to tell Sister Whoever!

Folk etymologies are actually really fascinating sometimes. That's what I tell myself, anyway :) 




 Many people think that. Some of them argue quite vehemently when you point out that they're incorrect. "I heard it from a guy and it's just common sense" always seems to trump "historical evidence" in their minds.

 




 Oh god, he *is*. I don't want to ever see him taken out! 




 Boy, it sure would be nice if we had some grenades, don't you think?

OH LOOK HE HAD SOME GRENADES. 




 A cure he was in control of. This ain't it. 




 Let's see how *you* react when your ex-fiancee, who has been lying to you for months, turns you into a zombie without your consent despite knowing you hate them.

 First the hooded hostage, and then she doesn't even have the decency to tell Major "Hey Ravi is working on a cure, so we just need to be patient and wait and keep eating dead people brains for a little while and everything will be alright."

That would mean fessing up that Ravi's been lying to him as well.

 Holy shit, suddenly everyone thinks only you can save your brother, yet only you know that you CANT. How is she going to explain that she can't give her blood?

Fess up that she has contracted the sort of disease that prevents you from donating blood. She hasn't told anybody because she wanted to handle it herself. She doesn't have to state that it's Zombieism. She could easily hint it's HIV, that can linger in the body for ages (especially with treatment) before it manifests as AIDS. There are other disease that preclude donation, such as hepatitis or TB, but her mother would probably recognize that she doesn't have those symptoms. 




 Except they have some leeway between healthy and raging. How many zombies can there even be in Seattle? If most of them are wealthy, as Blaine preferred, then they could easily simply decamp to other cities, one or two zombies per city, and make use of local morgues.

This would involve getting their own hands dirty, which I'm sure they wouldn't like, but I doubt many of them would really prefer to go on a rampage. 




 The freezer that's been bombed and has a broken window, that the cops will be swarming all over in a few hours? 




 Does eating zombie brains actually work?

Plus, this eating brains thing isn't like google. 




 Major is, indeed, dumb as a box of rocks, but his heart is in the right place even when his head isn't. 





























 I got an abortion last month, and I *wasn't even pregnant*! It was fun!

 That must have been quite a while ago. The earth's population as of 2013 was ~7.125 billion. We hit the 7 billion mark sometime in the middle of 2011.

 A culture without money isn't unworkable. Certainly, such cultures have existed.

The Federation *as written* doesn't seem to work very well without money, probably because the writers simply tranplanted American culture and said "oh, yeah, but no money!" rather than planning out how it functions. 




 I learned something new today. I'd thought "meteor" referred to the whatever-it-is before it falls, and was about to out-pedant the pedant, but apparently:

 Most of us probably have seen meteors or shooting stars. A meteor is the flash of light that we see in the night sky when a small chunk of interplanetary debris burns up as it passes through our atmosphere. "Meteor" refers to the flash of light caused by the debris, not the debris itself. 

http://hubblesite.org/reference_desk/faq/answer.php.id=22 cat=solarsystem

So I learned something new! And also, meteors aren't the things that are falling, although I'm never, ever going to say that again. When is that ever going to be helpful to a conversation? 







































 Perhaps they should be. 




 It's not political correctness. It's *manners*. 




 If that makes you happy, why not? 




 So? We're not talking about math. We're talking about interactions with human beings. The kind path is *always* the correct one.

And I happen to like squirrels. Cute little things! I mean, they're territorial as fuck, and they're not as vegetarian as people believe, but they're clever. 




 You're not asking questions in good faith, you're JAQ-ing off. 




 Strangely, not. While we don't know exactly what percentage of the population has mosaicism, some studies show that it's more common among transgender individuals - they literally have some cells xx and some xy. 

And there are a surprising number of people out there who present externally as female but are xy. Nobody does a gene test before naming the baby. They just glance at the body and move on.

Not to mention the fact that there are some differences in brain structure from male to female, and transgender individuals have brain structures more like the "opposite" sex than their assigned gender. 

Science shows us that transgender is based on real, provable things.

Regardless, I fail to see how your argument has merit. Let's say they were absolutely making things up. Does it harm you to say "she" instead of "he"? Of course not! So why spend over an hour on reddit commenting about it? 




 Science actually doesn't have an opinion, which is good, because science shows that a surprising number of people with external genitalia that appears to be female are male, and that there are a large number of people with two sets of genes in their bodies. We're only just now finding out how common mosaicism is, and the answer to that is "more than we thought". 




 Mmm. Transgender acceptance is lifesaving, literally. Transition is the accepted treatment for gender identity dysphoria, and is associated with a reduction in suicide and all sorts of other bad things. 




  People can believe whatever they want to do. It just doesn't make it true.

Indeed. You, for example, believe that somebody's genetic makeup is more important than their self-identification. You believe that something you say you don't care about is more important than good manners. You believe that this sort of argument is more important than other people's happiness and general well-being.

I believe you're a nitwit. One of the two of us is right in our beliefs. It's not you 




 Look, if you came up to me and said "squeek squeek I'm a squirrel", all I'd say is "You want a peanut?"

This is not the hill I'm willing to die on. If somebody tells me they're a man or a woman, it's a lot easier - and certainly more polite - to just go "yup, okay" than to argue with them. Because they care and *I don't*. So why not go with the flow? It's not important to me, after all.

Edit: Peanuts and sunflower seeds are not good for squirrels. Do not give peanuts to squirrels. Excessive consumption of peanuts is linked to bone deformities in squirrels. If you want to feed the squirrels, tree nuts are a better choice, along with lentils, seeds, and dried corn in moderation. Some fresh fruit will also not go amiss. I use the term simply because it is more euphonious than "You want some pecans and maybe a small amount of lentils?" 




 And why do you care? Seriously, if I decide to call myself Emperor of New York, so long as I don't levy taxes what business is it to you? 




 So it does bother you. It bothers you enough that you would rather call somebody by the pronoun you've decided is correct rather than the one they prefer. 




 Surgery is not a common option. For one thing, it's apparently not terribly effective, and for another you can't exactly show it off like a tattoo. It doesn't accomplish her primary objective, which is to have the general public see her as a female rather than a male. Nobody does that by ordering folks to drop trou, they just eyeball it.

 Reddit code is a little opaque. If you click the link that says "formatting help" on the right, directly under your comment, it gives you a cheat sheet without causing you to lose what you were typing.

 You use your own best judgment. By the later series of Star Trek, the Prime Directive had become a crutch so that Star Fleet could wash its hands of having to use *any* judgment at all. "Too bad, so sad, prime directive!" It's morally equivalent to using "zero tolerance" to expel kids for playing tag. 




 And yet, in a way they revisited the idea later when Tuvok was in that accident that wiped his memories and skills. When the Doctor found a cure, that Tuvok wasn't 100% behind losing his *new* personality and going back to the way he had been either.

And nobody ever mentions this episode, as near as I can tell. Well, that Tuvok was slightly more willing to go with the procedure than Tuvix had been. Why the heck did Voyager do the same plot twice with the same character? 




 They were already dead, like this horse we're beating.

 "If we screw this up, those people might become... *religious*". (Not an actual quote, but man, that's the vibe I get sometimes from Federation humans. Religion, it's like some embarrassing disease that everybody else has to pretend doesn't make you stinky.)

Okay, Rodenberry, I get that you're an atheist. I'm an atheist. We're all atheists... or we will be in the future, anyway (I'm actually an atheist today and have been my whole life). Atheism is awesome! But can you stop being a snotty *jerk* about it? Sheesh.

(Of course, I find it hard to believe that humanity just tossed religion en masse. I just can't see it.)

Also also: Clive isn't stupid. He's going to figure out that something's up, sooner or later. 




 One ep, I think - the promo calls next week the finale. 




 Plus, by rendering those two planets uninhabitable by their respective enemies, Sisko effectively removed them from the gameboard. The relocated Federation colony was guaranteed not to be troubled by Cardassians again, and I bet even the Dominion left them more or less alone (at least when they were playing at being friends with Cardassia.)

Likewise, their Cardassian counterparts had no fear of reprisals by the Maquis for anything Cardassia did.

 The explosion of the Romulan sun. Definitely, 100% tied up with that, unless we declare all of Enterprise out of continuity with New Trek.

 I actually know somebody who got measles three times. Didn't stick. Natural immunity is not as foolproof as you believe. The only way to know if you are still immune to measles is to get your titers checked. 




 As a *person*, he's great. As a *character*...? No fault of his, nor the actor, but the writers never bothered to do much with him other than set him up with every not available chick in the Delta Quadrant. 




 Incorrect. They could go and have their titers checked at the doctor, and then selectively have a booster shot of any disease they are no longer immune to. 




 A dozen comments down the line and *now* you don't want to "pollute star trek"? C'mon! Star Trek is all *about* modern day social issues and heavy handed messages. You can't pollute it with more of the same! 




 You know, I never got that episode. I mean, if you accept the premises it's a great ep, but the premises don't make any sense.

Crazy cult leader talks about how "we have more supporters than you think", and indeed, *somebody* (who didn't deign to travel with them) invented that device. (And a different group of people with broadly similar aims sabotaged Risa that time - really, I'd love to have seen Star Trek tackle its malcontents more.)

There must be billions and billions of humans in the Federation, and god knows how many other biologically compatible (you know, fertility-wise) species. Even if her actual number of supporters was a ludicrously low percentage, she surely could have gotten actual *volunteers* to live in her low-tech colony in the boondocks. Even if they couldn't get an official Federation charter, they could've still "crashed" the ship in the usual way, except they all would have been more prepared for roughing it.

Even for a crazy cult leader with delusions of grandeur, she certainly doesn't seem to have approached this logically.

 No, no. Cut them in half, cover with a maple-dijon sauce, roast at 350.

Alternatively, if you like to saute things, saute with bacon until good and caramelized, let cool, mix in sour cream. 




 Same as you roast any other vegetable - cover with oil and spices and perhaps a sauce, toss it in the oven at 350 until cooked. 




 Well, all dark leafy greens, even those not related to the brassica family, do tend to have similar nutrients.  




 It's a myth. Is it true you guys boil yours instead of roasting or steaming them? 




 Nice. You should crosspost that at /r/infographics 




 Mustard, the condiment, is made from mustard seeds and other things. You'd want to eat mustard greens to get the benefits of kale without eating kale. 




 Yes you are. It's a root vegetable, like turnips (another brassica), but less peppery. You can eat it raw in salads, or you can roast it just like you would a potato (or turnip). It's very crunchy, with a mild flavor. 




 Mustard is certainly a brassica, along with the above list and also turnips, bok choi, and (more distantly) radishes.

If you see mustard greens in the market, you'll see they're similar to turnip greens and kale. And if you ever plant cabbage or cauliflower, you'll see the seeds are very similar to mustard seeds. 

Wikipedia is the one in error if they don't list mustard as a member of the brassica family.

 Welcome to the wide world of discontinuity.

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity

For example, pretty much everybody agrees that Threshold never happened. It's an awful episode. Throw it out the window!

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discontinuity/LiveActionTV

If you scroll down, they have a lot of examples of popular "nope never happened" occurrences in Star Trek. 




 If you have to stand around waiting for the paint to dry before you can leave, you're still painted into it for the duration. 




 Those episodes are at least female-centered, so I'm okay giving a half-pass. (Other opinions may vary, and this is okay.) 




 Buffy fans argue all the time. I mean, maybe not your mom, but on the whole. 




  It was the execution that failed.

I suspect that's the crux of the Voyager hate. I mean, it's not a bad series - not great, but hell, there are plenty of episodes from each series that are really awful. But when you compare what might have been to what we got... geez.  




   I don't like Neelix and Kes together  it works on paper, but they have absolutely no chemistry together.

You know, if they'd settled that issue properly, that would have made sense. Neelix and Kes hooked up because of the whole way they met and how she got rescued. This is not such an uncommon story, and oftentimes couples that start this way find out later that they're not suited for each other. 

But they never resolved it properly, which means that instead of a proper story we have... a couple with no chemistry and you don't know why they stay together. 




  Paris works quite well, though towards the end of the series it's ridiculous how many things they have him doing or being an expert it.

Yes, it is. There's no reason they couldn't have fobbed some of that off on Harry, given him something to do besides lack any form of growth. Harry could've been the more or less competent medic, and we could have seen that all those Holodeck programs were the combined efforts of Harry and Tom together rather than Tom being a good writer and a decent programmer as well.

That's two complaints with one fix. 




 You know, Jeri Ryan is a surprisingly good actor. You keep thinking she's just male gaze eye candy, but she just keeps surprising you! 




 The Q episodes on Voyager are the only Q episodes I am willing to watch. (Well, other than the single scene where Q get punched by Sisko, that's great.) Which is good, because I utterly refuse to watch any episode with the Borg Queen, so it evens out.

Ugh, the Borg Queen. If she's going to be creepy and sexually repressed, I want to know why she doesn't just modify a drone to... well, anyway, those episodes make me cringe in all the bad ways. 




 The good episodes could be really good, and there weren't too many cringe-worthy clunkers.

Unfortunately, most episodes were just... eh. They weren't good, they weren't bad, they were simply watchable.

However, I will point out something I really liked, although it's hard to explain why. In one episode on Voyager, the whole crew is going crazy trying to solve this brain teaser puzzle. On TNG, a fad like that had a decent shot of being an evil alien conspiracy. On Voyager, it was just a fad like the last one Paris spread around - yo-yos! I don't know why, but that tickled me pink. 




  Can you honestly say you'd be entirely happy continuing the relationship?

Well, I'd be a little weirded out, but I like to think that I'm dating/married to this person for who they are, not how they look. If I'm not going to split up with them for getting into a car accident and losing a limb, or for growing older, or for suddenly developing an inconvenient allergy, or for getting cancer, then I certainly hope I'm not going to ditch them for a relatively minor cosmetic change!

How shallow do you think we all are, anyway? 




 Or 3 - Star Trek diverged from our universe somewhat earlier than previously supposed. 




 Actually, people do like them. Comics with Miles Morales *sell*. That's why they're introducing him in the main universe. 




 Buuuuut that's exactly what we're talking about - Peter Parker training Miles Morales as Spiderman. Did you read the article? 




 It's not making Parker gay. It's bringing Miles Morales into the main universe, and they're only doing this because stories with Miles Morales sell. I don't even *read* comics, I gleaned this all from my nieces, and it makes perfect sense to me.

They're doing what *makes money*. That's what they *always* do. 




 You do realize that the original Annie was a blonde, right? And that Thor was a frog for a while? 




 He's saying that Spiderman shouldn't be Miles Morales. 





































































 You're looking at a correlation and assuming a causation. There's no evidence for this.
 




 How odd. I don't know how that happened, thanks for catching it. 












































 It's the context. People only ever say that to imply that so-and-so got the job due to their race or sex, and not on their merits. 




 Because people never say that in a vacuum. Instead, they say it specifically to non-whites and women to oh-so-subtly imply that *really* those people only got the job due to affirmative action and not because they are the most qualified.

It's all about the context, and just about the only context in which people say this is to insult those they believe - on zero evidence - should have let a white man get the job instead. 




 Worse news for the refugees, I should think.

The developed world is facing a population crunch. They're going to have to either accept more refugees and immigrants or watch as their numbers dwindle into irrelevancy.

They're reluctant to do the former because they're worried about the new demographics, but the latter isn't actually a viable plan. 









 That's very close to 1% of the worldwide population. 









 You're assuming that DarthGregor wasn't raised by two men or two women already.

And yes, I would say that in front of my mother (or my father, were he still alive). I'd also say I'd be just as happy had I been switched at birth with some other kid, because I would be. Why not? I wouldn't know any different.

And don't forget, most gays  who want kids adopt. A child in foster care would be grateful for *any* permanent, loving family. This isn't an either/or proposition for them. 




 You are aware that half of all gay people ARE women, right? 




 We certainly can't if your response to people who disagree with you is "oh, I think you're lying, welp, best stop talking about it!"

Drives me batty when people throw these things out like we'll all agree, and then refuse to engage with people who don't.

The difference between you and me is *I know people who grew up in households headed by same-sex couples*. I also know people who were raised by grandparents, or by their aunts and uncles, and I know people who were raised in foster care. That last group is the only one that spends much time worrying they would have had a better childhood had they been raised differently, because *any* permanent family would have been better than being shuffled around. 

I don't need to resort to hypotheticals, because I have observation on my side. 




 These people don't interact with the world in any sort of meaningful way, as near as I can tell. I know people who have grown up with gay parents, they're as happy and well-adjusted as anybody else. I know people who have grown up in foster care, they'd've been happier for ANY permanent family, no matter what the composition. 

And I've got the studies to back up the observation of my life. These people don't, which is why they have to rely on random hypotheticals, because they apparently don't realize that there are people who already live their oh-so-scary lives and are just fine. 




 Probably would be if more people were aware of them. They're harmless, and they're reusable. 

There are a few potential problems here, though. For one thing, not all women can use menstrual cups, and for another, those who can aren't all shaped the same way and a cup that works for one might not work for another. 




 They're reusable. You probably ought to boil them if you've had a yeast infection, and some women prefer to boil them every cycle, but you don't need to do so - simply washing with soap and water at the end of your cycle is sufficient. 




 It's not solely due to lack of funds. I mean, if that were the case I'd be glad to donate a freaking case of Divacups, but our damned punitive mindset... geez. 














 Sadly, it's normally racist. 




 About 3% of the population of the US identifies as gay or bisexual. 

However, there is a glaring problem with this number, and that's the fact that it depends on self-identification. We just don't know how many people have same-sex attractions but are unwilling to admit it, even on an anonymous survey. Heck, some of them might not admit it to themselves.

Edit: Google suggests that the percentage of people under 35 who identify as gay or bi is slightly higher than 3%, this is consistent with my speculation above. 




 Alex, I'll take pointless hypotheticals for $1000, please.

If I had two dads, that would be my normal. I'd be okay with that. If i had two moms, that would likewise be my normal. If I was raised by my grandma, or by Ma and Pa Kent, *that would be normal to me*.

No matter how we grow up, that's our basis of comparison. So long as they're loved, children thrive. 




















































































  I think it's important to recognize people who have done great things for America. For example, I'm Jewish. I can't really name a Jew who's done something major for America, even though I'm sure there are buttloads.

Albert Einstein.

 It's certainly going to be interesting to see how the maps get redrawn once this all shakes out. I mean, we're in for a long wait on that front, but.... 





































































 At least, once they were taken to the edge of the valley and shown they weren't "real", they worked out that whoever programmed them probably made it so they'd never explore too far. 




 Have you considered a graywater system for flushing your toilet? 




 Into the ocean, mostly. It IS a closed system - but you and I can't drink salt water. 




 Like Sandy?  




 You're forgetting the part where coastal flooding will be *salt* water. 




 Most of the planet is oceans. Most rain eventually hits an ocean - not land. Once it hits the ocean, it mixes with the salt water there and becomes salty. You can't drink salt water. You can't irrigate your crops with salt water. 




 We are. But you can't drink salt water. 




 You skimmed, didn't you. 




 Picture group therapy.

On the one hand, a mixed group will have a lot of women who, understandably, may not be comfortable discussing their rapes in front of men.

On the other, you have men who as a result of their rape may be feeling emasculated or other things like that and might feel even more uncomfortable by the unspoken implication that only women get raped.

In this particular case, it makes sense to have two groups. 




 When you're stimulated enough, your body responds, whether you want to or not. A woman can certainly manipulate the penis until it gets hard or even orgasms. Difficult as it is to believe, there doesn't have to be desire for this to happen. There are many cases in war-torn places, for example, where men and boys have been forced to rape their sisters, daughters, or grandmothers. Obviously they didn't want to do this.

Women can also force cunnilingus or anally rape others. 




 In Sweden, or...? 




  Problem is if everyone is guaranteed basic income it'll never work, Inequality is practical essential for an economy to work

 Yes, and were replaced by other things. Where are the replacements this round? 




 Well, perhaps all that money does make people stupid.
