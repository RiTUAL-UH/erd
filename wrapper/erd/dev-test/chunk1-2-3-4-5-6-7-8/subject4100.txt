 I'm here to answer questions, mainly, but I do want to respond with one thing. Apostasy is something that is not supported anywhere in the Qur'an. What you are getting that fact from is the Hadith. The hadith are scriptures people wrote 200 years after the Prophet Muhammad died, and claimed he said this and that. The specific hadith this is coming from stated that if a muslim deconverts, kill him. 

That'd probably look true, if it didn't contradict the Qur'an itself. In the Quran, it is stated that killing a man is like killing humanity. The only two reasons it is justified in that text is when one is under attack and needs to defend himself, or if the man is causing harm humanity itself, under which a trial needs to be set forth with a judge. 




 Concerning your first link, these articles are mainly going into not what the Qur'an is saying itself, but what Islam itself has said about science, and how people of Islam have committed to modern science. One thing this article does say is that a group of people were saying that studying science from a point of nature leads people astray from 'God's path', which is completely disagreeable by me. reading these articles themselves, you can find that scholars and scriptures in Islamic history have condoned and encouraged to learn more about this universe we live in.

For the second link, I read the criticism of science in the Qur'an,and it all came down to evolution as the argument. This leads back to the book's statement that though life has evolved through natural selection, which is agreed both by modern scientists and the Quran today, humans had their own path of evolution. The criticism here is that the Qur'an is basically preaching Creationism. I don't see this as a case of complete creationism.  




 I do believe in this. I can give the verses from the Qur'an that actually support this statement. The exception was man in this common descent. Humans had their own descent, is what is basically believed by muslims. 




 I believe in evolution, and the fact that Homo Sapiens have indeed changed over time. The timeline in which Adam and Eve existed according to the Qur'an is thousands and thousands of years ago. They definitely did not look the same. The differing part here is that what the Quran states is that humans evolved in their own way. They were the ones who were different, having a conscience and a soul. Hopefully that answered your question. 




 An array of personal experiences and the thought that pretty much anything is just belief when one is something as small in this universe as a human. I chose not to state the fact that God is there and that I need to make sure everyone knows about this, but I chose to believe that it is possible he is there.

And by personal experiences I don't mean seeing Muhammad on my toast or anything. Hope that doesn't throw anyone off. 




 I actually finished the arabic translation of the Qur'an when I was 8, but I don't speak arabic. It's one of the reasons I never truly went tolearn about it in the first place. 




 I'll look into those readings, thanks!


And just out of curiosity, can you lead me somewhere that supports Islamic studies against science? 




 This I agree with. It was something I kept in mind while reading the Qur'an. What it stated in its text was, rather, that the universe itself was created within six days, and no mention of God resting was given, considering the fact that for something to be so divine, it must be perfect in its own way too. Though I think the six days phrase was given to give the people of Muhammad's time an estimate of how long it would take for Him to make something so vast.  




 For clarification, I was referring to the part where God created the earth 6000 years ago, and then put animals on land first. 

EDIT: To make things clear, I get that people are gonna bring up arguments against me, but if that happens, please give me something to argue with. If you disagree with the fact that it is parallell to scientific discoveries, then let me know how. Give context. I'm not downvoting anyone here, but don't take advantage of this and troll around. Let's actually talk. 




 I get what you're saying. But to me, if this is the case, then all religious people can be considered agnostic. They choose to believe in something divine and have their own ways of believing.

However, I also think this can apply to atheists as well. As much as many people can claim to know that there is no god, or a religious person can 'know' there is a god, it is beyond any human's capacity to know the truth. Like Carl Sagan has said, we are nothing but this pale blue dot. We can't ever truly know what caused this universe, but given the evidence and explanations we have, we can make a belief.

Stephen Hawking himself has said that there isn't a necessity for a divine being to have the universe created. A certainty for that, however, is still always debated. 




 Check conundri's comment for the response. 




 In short, yes. I am a religious person, but a big factor I want to highlight is that the main reason I returned to be religious was because the religion itself valued science. Your question's better answered in the response I gave to conundri somewhere in this thread. :) 




 So like I said, being a muslim and not knowing much about its background and logic caused me to look back at religion as a whole, and atheism as well.

I'd find time to try and learn different things and see what I fit with. For example, at a hotel I tried checking out the Bible, which resulted with me stopping after two pages of Genesis. 

As for Islam, I went back and read it's history, read the Qur'an in the many translations I could find. I read annotations, philosophies, and the writings of Islamic scholars. In the end, after choosing that God is real to me, Islam made the most sense for it. I'll answer any questions of the religion itself if you want to go into details.

One big thing, though, was the fact that Islam let me keep my belief in evolution. I was reassured by the fact that Islam was parallel to scientific facts and encouraged studying life straight from the Qur'an itself. 




 Pretty much the story. I've been raised as a Muslim, and had a point in time a year back when I turned agnostic and went into trying to learn everything I could of religious and alternative perspectives on life.

I've been a Redditor for almost a year now, and tend to visit r/atheism quite a bit along with other subs (you guys have my sense of humor). I haven't really seen many religious people having conversations with atheists that are as intellectual as I'd hope for them to be. Maybe I can answer your questions in a clear way considering I've been pretty open with both theist and atheist views. :)

EDIT: It's 12:30 AM here, and I have class in the morning. I promise I'll get to answering questions tomorrow, whenever time allows me to. Thanks to the few who are criticizing in their questions, but debate respectfully!  




 Haha, nah I get it now. I'm just sleepy.

Pretty much, I was 17, and around that age, pretty much everyone starts to question things. When one's learning, his mind is gradually taking in ideas that become more and more unfamiliar with what he's already used to. With me being raised as a Muslim, I never really went into studying other religions, or atheism itself. I'd always see atheism as this 'OMG HOW COULD YOU NOT BELIEVE IN GOD' thing, actually. 

But around that age, it was my turn to start questioning things. I started thinking that if I'm devoting my life to this one religion, I honestly don't know that much about it, and the things around me are making me feel like there might not be a divine being to begin with. At that point, when I wasn't sure, I was an agnostic.

Eventually, I wanted to find a place to settle, whether that be Islam or something else. I researched many sides, and to put it in short, I chose to believe in a god. Once that was over with, I settled at Islam  because it made sense to me.

Hope that answers it! 




 I think I'm doing both that and r/atheism. And I don't exactly get what you're referring to when you say 'why?'..

 Hah, no we've all been in that spot before. It happens with me, no worries. But I've gotten that a lot, that my drawings are really sketchy. In a way, I kind of go for that. I'd like to call it my style. My art teacher would always have to deal with it when we had to do natural, or photographic drawings. 

The whole caption thing isn't the idea of it though. What I'd do with the quote is design it around him. I made it more blank space for that, because otherwise it does look boring. It's more of a part of the sketch,  rather than a caption at the side if you know what I'm trying to get at. Thanks though, man! 




 I actually don't think that highly of it. I started on this thing two hours ago after wanting to do it for so long. This isn't really anything to make me feel like I'm bothering anyone here. You guys *are* the ones that choose what happens. Just downvote it if you think otherwise. 




 That's actually really interesting. 




 I love this one. I thought of it as well. I'm trying to pick out which might be the best. It was between this and the Captain Planet one that I can't decide for now, unless someone gives something different. 




 So I pretty much feel like this guy is about to make history, and I highly, highly respect what he does. I also like drawing. So I decided to put that stuff together. I have his portrait pretty much done (I wish I could have edited a few things, but I do my stuff in pen), but I want to add a quote and design it around the sketch in a way. 

tl;dr: **What's a good quote to design over a sketch of Julian Assange?**

It doesn't really even have to be from him. Anything emphasizing his message can be suitable. One I had in mind was the one from Captain America you guys upvoted a while back:

"When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world - 'No, you move.'"

 **A Thousand Suns** - Linkin Park


Yeah, I said it. Downvote me. 




 Sharia law has become the cause of some of the worst ways to handle crimes in Islamic countries today. Not for what it stands for, but for what these guys have turned it into. I don't think there is one reasonable Islamic scholar helping countries like Iran out with their ways of law, or otherwise we wouldn't have shit like this happening: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/02/iran-stoning-sakineh-mohammadi-ashtiani
 
So we're gonna have people stoned for adultery, right? Because that's what the hadith, the said spoken words of the prophet Muhammad himself,  say in context to Sharia law? Alright then. Let's play it that way. Hopefully those countries still at least read how to do this whole stoning thing, right? Because what they've done so far is a completely half-assed job so far. Let's check the rules.
 
**1. If there's ever even a case for adultery, then there needs to be *four* witnesses of said case.**
 
But that's completely stupid, isn't it? Why in the world would two people ever have a legit affair in public? Especially in Iran? Oh, they just decided to get shit on in the middle of a public place in one of the most oppressed places in the East? I guess some people do roll that way. Okay, fine. So we have our criminals prosecuted. Let's get to the stoning?
 
**2. Only a sinless man may be the one to throw the stone.**
 
So here's where shit is supposed to go down. Except only someone who isn't guilty of sin themselves are allowed to throw the stone. Which is funny, because I've always thought we all are sinful. Aren't we? Isn't that the point of being human?
 
Damn, why was this stupid law even made? Why was this punishment made if we can't even get through with it? Is a divine being out there really hell bent on having his creations brutally murdered for being unfaithful? 

Or, to take a different way to look at it, was this law really made by a god who instead, made this punishment so hard to get to, that it has even other people look back at themselves before throwing that stone? Was this law simply made to give the human being a look on his own mistakes, before being the judge and executioner of someone else? By doing so, was this punishment even made to never be able to hit the criminals, the adulterers, leaving them to an open path to seek forgiveness?

If the latter, I seriously think it has been used in the wrong ways. From an outside perspective that takes a punishment like this at face value, it is one of the most barbaric rulings mankind has ever set, let alone a god. Then again, law was never made for stupid people. Everything has to be looked into, with detail. The above is the conclusion I came to about this ruling, which for me made it seem like it has reason embedded in it. To me, maybe these laws were set to be granted to a sane, responsible, and intelligent decision maker. I doubt those exist at all in the shithole of governments stationed in the Middle East.
 
So for the guys who control the way Iran works, take a good perspective at the way this whole stoning thing works. I really, really doubt one of you douchebags are completely clean yourselves. If not, I honestly pray you guys end up taking your own lives out of depression because there is absolutely no way you are benefiting life on this earth. If you were gone, life would be better preserved and protected. We are better off without you.
 
And don't call yourselves Muslims either. You guys sucked at that too, and you're making life harder as a Muslim for me.

/I know none of this may even get to the actual leaders. It just helps me focus when I actually direct the thing to the actual people. 




 I completely do. This guy's a great man and I'm glad he's getting attention. All I'm saying is he should have gotten it earlier. Before all this. 




 It is interesting, I agree with that. I guess I just feel irritated that it's when something this intense happens that we all of a sudden give him his spotlight. I would never, ever, ever hear of him like that back before he started hitting headline stories.

 Once I was walking to my car after working at a studio in school. A cop stopped and started driving idly next to me to ask me what kind of guitar I have. I told him, and he asked me if I know any Johnny Cash, who happens to be one of my idols. We then go off into a conversation that lasted a good five minutes, naming any songs by him, whether I can play them, the AMAZINGNESS of the Walk the Line movie. The cop then wished me a good day and drove off. 

Most of these guys really are just normal people doing what they gotta do. I've got respect. That conversation made my day.

I deleted it because it was getting downvoted for whatever reason. I call out my guy friends everytime they make another borderline pathetic "make me a sandwich" joke, and I make damn sure I respect everyone I have the pleasure to meet; man or woman.

But in case guys haven't noticed this either: *we* are part of the problem as well.

 I don't know about you, but reading this random submission on Reddit just slapped me in the face to get back up and work on my goals. Reading those words from his dad gave me hope in fulfilling my goals to be as good of a father as I can be in the near future.

 I don't listen to you guys much, other than your Umbrella cover, but my brother has always been a huge fan. Just wanted to say thanks for coming out and doing this. It's always awesome to see someone from a big band come out and take the heat from people on the internet to answer questions for their fans. 

My question is, I'm aspiring to be an artist sometime in the future as well. Either through music or film. What advice would you give for someone who doesn't necessarily want the fame or the big life, but to at least be heard for what he does?

Thanks! 




 I may not listen to All Time Low, but my younger brother happens to be one of their biggest fans, and he's always been the one to pick up after the shit his friends do, and look after his friends because of the stupid stuff that they do. He's the one who makes sure our family stays sane in times of tension, and he's always been there for anyone he loves. My brother is 16 years old, and I can already see more balls in him than I can see in you, if I was even to be given an entire biography on your predictably sad life. I'm willing to bet on that.

 Sorry for the incredibly late response. Studying took me over the past two days. But hopefully you read this.

Okay, so these passages were the passages I knew people would ask about, and there is good reason to. If I read something like this, I'd surely feel threatened too. So why is it in the Qur'an? The defenders of the Qur'an will always tell you you have to look into the context, but that's an overly stated and under-explained argument, in my opinion. I'll try giving you the full reasoning.

The Qur'an was not released as a book back in it's time. The Prophet Muhammad was given, so we believe, these passages over a series of an Islamic lunar month (which you may know today as Ramadan). They were speeches given to him by an angel named Jibrail who made him memorize these passages. This was a time of war for him and his people. It wasn't a great time for them either. People didn't like that Muhammad was speaking of the idols they worshipped as false, and that he was asking them to see that there is one creator of the universe. It turned into the dark ages for them. Muhammad's many family members and friends were actually killed and tortured for the sake of angering him. These conflicts escalated, and during that time, people looked to him for guidance because he's been their leader this far. They trusted him. 

The passages you gave (2.191-93) was given as speeches to him to guide his people down the right path as they entered this war. And the thing is, these attackers could have murdered their families beforehand, yet this passage specifically ensured that the Muslims kill only when they're being attacked. If anyone surrendered at all, then show no hostility to them. This passage wasn't given as an order to kill any disbeliever anyone sees, but an order to fight with defense against an army in a time of crisis.

To make the best metaphor I can out of this, imagine your parent's parenting history put into a book. Should I have gone back and read that your mom said "I'm going to beat you", I'd be all 'WHOAA. CALL CHILDRENS AID. NOW.'

The exception is when I would have to go back and read the history of what was happening at that moment, when you probably did something to get her mad. The main thing the Quran has in common with what one learns from his parents is that they both have issues that deal with everything. There's violence, and peace, but all of them are told through interconnected stories to bring through one message: be a good person. 

As for believing in god or going to hell, I have my thoughts on it as well. We all interpret our religions our own way, and I think that these people would have had the proff right there for them. They've seen Muhammad cut a moon in half, and miracles that would be unbelievable. The disbelievers in the time of this scripture tended to be unkind people, and I think the Qur'an, as well as any other scripture, stated that if one has seen the truth, but chooses not to believe it, would await whatever judgement that god sets on him. In the end, I honestly think it comes down to be a good person, and to help humanity. The Quran gave passageways that explained not to ever forcefully place an ideology, even Islam, onto a person, and Muhammad carried this out by making Constitutions with monks and christian villages that established freedom of religion. But that's just my two cents on it.

I'll end this with another passage that can hopefully sum up howthe Quran is not a book of rules and guidelines on a list, but rather a series of stories from times of hardship and basic human problems and the morals we must overall learn from them, whether we believe in a God or not. 

  If anyone slew a person unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land it would be as if he slew the whole humanity: and if anyone saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole humanity.

This was one passageway that allowed me to choose this religion if I'm going to believe in a god. I like the fact that it's struggling for the better of humanity as a whole.

Let me know if i made anything unclear. Again, sorry for being so late!

 




 Wow man. You're a douchebag. 




 Your friend was trying to match it together to make it seem as if God really did just want us to decrypt the science out of the book. My view is basically the assumption you made of the Quran being a metaphorical book of signs. And by the way, please don't hesitate to ask me on any passage, nasty or not! I want to do the best I can at explaining those too. And thanks for being respectful while making criticism. :) 




 Which is why i read it first. I simply said translation to clarify that I read it in Arabic. Sorry for the misunderstanding. :\ 




 I do think that is a valid assertion, like the many subreddits we have here, people see things in their own ways, and people fit text with meanings to see something in their way. I've done this myself.

To make it clear, nothing ever convinced me that God (or Allah) is real. I am not at a point where I know for sure that there is a god. I was faced with a simple question: whether there is a God or not. From everything I've known and experienced, I chose to *believe*. Choosing Islam was a second step. Basically, it supported what I *wanted*: belief in a divine creator, and the fact that religion and science can come together. I gave it the most recognition. It made sense to me. This won't be the case with everyone. 




 I think I spoke in the wrong way. I was trying to state that it was brought up in a metaphorical way. Agreeing with what you said.

I think in order for humans to understand something so great, metaphorical poetry was necessary. It's a way to connect. The Quran is not a book of science, but a book of understanding the picture. Science is the anatomy which we have been told to study. 




 I like this. 




 I don't think you understood the part where I said during my agnostic phase, I was studying everywhere about this. Agnosticism = knowledge. I get it. AMA still relevant. 

And sorry, but r/atheism isn't some secret club where you need to present yourself in a certain way to be 'accepted' by the community. People come, people talk, regardless of belief, if it's on the topic of atheism. I came here to hopefully give people a better idea of what a religious guy can be like. I'm not an asshole. I came to talk like one would at a bar. Thanks.

I don't think all religious people are as easily offended as you think they are. 




 Another person replied to you talking about how Lasers basically sounds like the studio made the album for him. It's because they did. Lupe Fiasco was in a legal battle with Atlantic for about a year or so before they would even let him release Lasers because of their disagreements over what should be on it. Lupe himself has not only admitted, but spoken out on his dislike for Lasers. 

I went to a concert of his about a year before Lasers came out, and it was a concert actually promoting the then-expected album. The T-shirts for the tour had something called 'The Lasers Manifesto' written on the back. Look it up if you have the time, because it really is a nice message to see on the back of the shirt other than just the tour dates.

Basically, Lupe hated his own album, and promised his fans that the next one will be what both he and the fans wanted. 

And with that, I ask you to listen to his newest album: Food and Liquor II. It'll definitely change your mind on whether he's still an amazing lyricist or not.

Let's have a toast for the real terrorists out there: a toast to the conservative talk radio hosts that fill the minds of idiots up with ideologies that every brown skinned turban-wearing citizen in our country is out to destroy our beautiful country. Thank you, again, for setting more people out there to act like dogs on their unjustified hatred for people who don't look, dress, or live the same way they do. They couldn't have done it without your help. 




 I'll post mine. [J. Robert Oppenheimer's commentary, after having witnessed the destruction his atomic bomb can cause, is short and powerful.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8H7Jibx-c0) I can't imagine what he felt at that moment. 




 I'm not asking for a video based simply on gore or shock value. I'm also not necessarily asking for something that can find itself onto an episode of Ghost Hunters. I want you guys to post a video that truly hit you to the core; something that made you realize how destructive and scarred people can make the world, or themselves. 




 OP here. This was posted on Facebook by one of my friends in Jordan. Even he thought this was ridiculous for what he usually sees. I'm a Pakistani-American myself so I tend to see some crazy drivers over there as well. 

But this.. uh. 




 You must be a really cheerful guy in person.

Oh, and the person that shot this picture took it in Jordan. Your shallow comments shouldn't even offend anyone because you obviously have no clue what you're talking about. 









 Are you sure you're not just listening to the preview? The song's over 8 minutes in length.. 




 Are you sure you're not just listening to the preview? You do realize the song is over 8 minutes in length, right..? 




 Oh hey! Something else I had no earthly clue existed until a Redditor brought attention to it! 




 Whenever I get impatient about something and someone says something along the lines of "Don't worry, just wait.", I instinctively cut them off with "I DID MY WAITING. TWELVE YEARS OF IT.

 It's 5:44 AM, and I'm laughing more than I should have been when I got to Schumacher.

 If you want to be rest assured with how much difference there can be between the quality of a movie and it's poster, take a look at these two:

 This is a bit late, but I'm the guy that originally wrote this picture. The original post is in my username history. Yeah, it's Plano, Texas. 




 It's like DanielOnFilm said in this thread. Pixar's characters have identity. It's not sound editing, or anything being extra done by the voice cast. The characters are simply written brilliantly. 

I'm the other way around because of it. I can't watch any other Tom Hanks movie without thinking about Woody in the middle of Omaha Beach or trying to capture Leonardo DiCaprio. 




 (Dat mean he luv her moar den 4eva) 




 JUST STAY OFF THE SET YOU FUCKING PRICK. 




 Yep, that was my intention. Somewhat of a remake of that storyline. I've given it more of a Middle-Eastern/South Asian influence to replace the Irish influence given in the Scorcese movie.

Thanks! 




 Thank you! Working on it. 









 Into the West - Howard Shore and Annie Lennox. I'm pretty sure it's the only song to ever have made me cry. 




 Out of all the changes that have happened in the time between the release of *Blink-182* and *Neighborhoods*, what was/still is one of the hardest things to deal with personally and professionally for you as a band member and as a friend?

 What about [There Will Be Blood](http://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/movie/movie_poster/there-will-be-blood-2008/large_gULACAZnPnyauix3mgMKG63UkXt.jpg) and [No Country for Old Men](https://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/images/info/80/2008_01_picture_nocountry_big.jpg)? 




 For anyone that's interested, this is the full track that plays when Simba meets Rafiki and [has one last talk with Mufasa as father and son.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE_1NGhMwHQ) It comes from an unreleased extended version of the Lion King soundtrack. 




 A few people have brought up the notion that the score heard in the trailer doesn't seem as memorable or as melodic to them as the original Superman theme by John Williams. There was widespread praise, but every good work is subject to critique.

Sorry, I worded my thoughts wrong on the title by saying "complaining". For the record, I can't stop replaying that trailer. It's incredible just for the music. 




 You're right. I think I worded it wrong in the title. I meant to refer to the notion that his music has more recently become music that we typically can't find ourselves "humming" along with. At most times, especially with The Dark Knight, his music ends up being a perfect complement to the film, even changing the way the industry works at times (see the overuse of *brrraahhh* in movie trailers today, or the emulations of the anxiety and suspense inducing cello string for the Joker's theme); but looking back at it in a musical perspective, it ends up being almost forgettable to someone who wouldn't remember the context of the movie.

I never fail to get a chill down my spine when I listen to "Rise" from the TDKR soundtrack, but it's because I remember that ending scene, and what emotions that moment gave me as a viewer. It's different from when I hear the theme to "Jurassic Park". It's a melody that invokes beauty on its own to such a large audience without having to know any context at all. 

I always get frustrated that I can't find a good way to play the theme to The Dark Knight on a piano. Most of the time nobody would be able to recognize it when I play at a bar; but I've had a number of people asking me what I just played when I play the Jurassic Park theme, and tell me it sounded beautiful.

This is just my thoughts from what I've experienced as a musician and filmmaker. I don't mean to state any of it as fact. I put a link to The Lion King up because it invokes that same feeling I get from a John Williams track. People fall in love with the melody of The Lion King, or even "Time" by Zimmer, without necessarily having to remember or know the movie. I wanted to remind people how capable of that he still is.  




 [This set image of him as Electro was also released a few weeks ago.](http://i.imgur.com/AGDJXzQ.jpg)
 









 The Social Network won best soundtrack that year. 




 Sounds so soulful, don't you agree? 




 I see it as the story being told from a different perspective, or through a different lens, when told by Galadriel at the beginning of Fellowship. There's a certian theatricality in the way Sauron was forging the ring and fighting the Last Alliance that made it seem like the story was told in a perceptive way. 


The difference in the way Bilbo found the ring in The Hobbit: AUJ can simply be argued as how it looked from Bilbo's perspective. He was telling the story from the beginning, after all. 


In a way, it lets the audience decide what was actuality and what was perspective. It's like we're allowed to imagine things out in the movie universe as if it's still a book. That's refreshing to me. 




 Thanks for doing this. A lot of people are bringing up the the negative points in your career, but I wouldn't worry too much about the people that are just trying to get a reaction out of you.

That being said, I'm an aspiring writer/director, and I wanted to ask about the beef you've had with with people in the industry. How does it affect how you work? How has it affected the direction of your career? Is that sort of publicity something that becomes significant in how it affects you based on what your career's been through? 




 She'll wait a couple months and she gon see 




 How you see the film in 2013 is how it looked right down to the bone when it was shot. The increased contrast and saturation was a common thing used in films, and it worked and looked good for the medium.


When they have to digitally convert the entire movie for IMAX and 3D screens, it becomes problematic for two reasons. One is that when blowing the images up, the adjustment in saturation and contrast will result in a grainier look not fit for bigger screens. The other is that the grading of the original wouldn't convert well into 3D at all. Think of the 2013 version as the clearest, normal image they could work with. It's an emulation of how films shot digitally look today.


The color grading is also starting to be used by different directors in this style if they want to make the film look old for their narrative. Ben Affleck does it with Argo by blowing up the picture to make it grainier, along with shooting it in film to give it that exact lush color grading. 




 That statement itself is an absolute. 




 You were just so excited to show us your comment that you couldn't wait past 6 minutes to screenshot it. 




 You guys are the bane of my existence. 




 DFW here as well. The speed is consistently good the closer I am to the city. However, it starts to teether between EDGE and 3G by the time I get around Richardson or Plano. 




 Have Echoes, Silence, Patience   Grace. I'm checking out the other. 




 ...aand I fucked up on the spelling there. Forgive me.  









 I would have been euphoric myself in that moment.

 The reason they called themselves Lincoln Park in the first place was because they wanted to make sure people don't associate their name with a certain type of music that they play. That the names a name, and they progress how they feel with their music. It's because the domain name for a website was too expensive for them that they changed the spelling to Linkin Park. 




 In their defense, the song 'Iridescent' was completely fucked over after they remixed it for the movie. It ruins the buildup of an otherwise good song with decent lyrics with the same shitty pop beat layered over the entire thing. [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpt7RJUGpdE) the actual song if anyone wants to try it out.  




 Mike is the most versatile member, a co-producer of their past three records, and the member who contributes most to the music industry through different business partnerships, but that shouldn't detract him from the rest of the band when it comes to Linkin Park's music itself.


Mike Shinoda had the opportunity to graduate with a college degree, but Chester grew up witnessing a few of his friends die and knowing a few that committed suicide. He had a time when he was addicted to crystal meth shortly before the band found him by luck through a newspaper ad and hired him. He never really ended up venturing beyond that when the band kicked off.


Even then, he's come a long way. He's always the most well spoken person in any interview the band is given. 




 Put it on top and make sure you have Sarif on.  




 I'll be updating you as soon as it's ready.  




 It comes with Sarif! The lock screen alone is worth it.  




 Sorry about that. The link's up now. I'm going to work on one for the 4 and 4S too, so hopefully I'll have it up by tonight. It's 12 PM here right now. Thanks for the patience! I'll update you as soon as I'm done.  




 Oh, damn! I'm sorry man. I was up studying at around 3 AM when I wrote that, so I was a bit delirious. Anyway, I edited the link in now so it should work. Hope you like it! 




 Update: I just got the okay from [Cody Gordon](http://reddit.com/user/WhiteBaron) to go ahead and upload the mod. Here's the package specifically edited generously by him so it's as convenient to install as possible. He told me to let everyone know that they will have to move the lockscreen wallpaper (bg_ip5.png) into Sarif.theme if they want to use it. The mod is also designed only for the iPhone 5.


https://www.dropbox.com/s/whkgyym4uwct9ly/Sarif%20Black.theme.zip


I'll try making one for the iPhone 4 if you guys ask. Hope you all like it.

EDIT: Just wanted to give a shoutout to the developer of Sarif. He's been looking over what I sent him to make sure it's done right so you guys don't have any problems. The guy's awesome. I strongly recommend you buy the theme and support him, even if you don't want the mod I worked on. It's a sick look on the phone, and something anyone can really appreciate.  




 Good stuff, man. I like the wallpaper. 




 I'm sent a message to the original developer for permission before I send the mod out. I'll have it posted as soon as I get the okay! 




 Will do. Just a heads up, I didn't mean icons from outside sources. I was referring to the icons that come with the Sarif package itself, the ones you have to buy. The custom wallpaper and keypad is the only thing I'm giving out.  I altered the theme so that you have to separately buy Sarif in order for it to work. I'll check with him first, though. Thanks for the information!

Edit: He got back to me letting me know it's fine. Thanks for helping me with contacting him again! 




 Let me get to you in about an hour when I get out of class. I'll edit into this comment with a link to the theme and hopefully be able to help out with the icon packs. 




 The icons are provided by the creator of the original theme. You can go to the website [here](http://codylg.com/work/iphone/sarif/) and find information on how to get them. They come in packages and get updated pretty often. 




 I'm really picky on themes, but [Sarif](http://codylg.com/work/iphone/sarif/) was an instant buy for me because of how thorough, professional, and simple it is. I did want it to fit my "all-black-everything" taste, though, so I designed a makeover that essentially replaces the brown wooden look of the theme with a black wooden look instead. It fits in perfectly with the Black UI mod that Sarif comes with.



If you guys like it, I can put up a link for the theme package itself for those who ask. You will need to download Sarif for it to work, but it's completely worth the $2.00 and I highly recommend it. 









 I didn't think he could pull it off, but I didn't notice Samuel L. Jackson as Samuel L. Jackson at all in Django Unchained. I absolutely hated the man he was playing on screen. Every time he was on screen, I just wanted to beat the shit out of him. And then I realized that this actor is still amazing at what he does: suspending my belief. 




 The first time I ever saw him in a movie was when I watched The Lost World: Jurassic Park as a kid. Naturally, now I only see him as that guy from Jurassic Park everytime I see him in a romantic comedy. 

Also, I can't take The Lost World seriously anymore everytime he shows up in it now. 




 You... have an iPhone 5... 




 I'm having trouble downloading and opening the shared.artwork filr in Safari or Dropbox. Can someone help me out with this?  




 Looking through this thread, I'm seeing that many people don't really know the full story that made Trent Reznor do this, so I'll try filling it in.


The reason Trent found it wrong was because while he was touring with Nine Inch Nails in Australia, he came across a record store that had his album for over $30, while there was an Avril Lavigne from the same respective label being sold for $21.99.


When he called Universal asking him why there's a price difference between the two, their response was, "It's because we know you have a real core audience that will pay whatever it costs when you put something out -- you know, true fans. It's the pop stuff we have to discount to get people to buy."


This is what made Trent do what he did at that concert. He's not another guy saying "Fuck you, establishment!", but he is challenging his label executives on the morality of their business. 




 It's not about the currency exchange difference. Looking through this thread, I'm seeing that many people don't really know the full story that made Trent Reznor do this, so I'll try filling it in.

 I hope Mike Shinoda comes back to work on the score for this film as well. 




 The Dark Knight Returns. A good rendition of Frank Miller's novel would be incredibly engaging. It'd be good to see that, keeping in mind that it's geared toward an older audience. Batman has become something that people of all ages have come to love. This would be a good one for the more mature population.

I'm always late to these posts. Damn. 




 I loved it. If you think of The Lion King as a Disney's retelling of Hamlet, like others have pointed out before, then thinking of Simba's Pride as their retelling of Romeo and Juliet is a cool way of appreciating the storylines and themes of the two movies. 




 *Karm- 

Oh. 




 You must be great at parties. 




 3:10 to Yuma (2007). I usually tend to get dulled out by westerns, but this one was highly enjoyable. 
























 [Here's the link](http://society6.com/Maazcon/Chemistry-Hjg_Print#1=2) to it! I just set it up on my society6 account. 




 WAIT IT'S MY CAKE DAY?

oh^and^thank^you.. 




 I turned it into the two BrBa subreddits I visit most frequently. It's awesome to hear you saw that post too. Thank you! 




 Thank you. I want to see how it looks, by the way! 




 That puts my mind to a lot of rest. I've been obsessed with Yoji Shinkawa. He's the kind of artist i don't think anyone can ever accurately emulate. I feel lucky even to be close enough to give him a subtle homage.  




 **EDIT 2:** [Here's a link to my Society6 account](http://society6.com/Maazcon/Chemistry-Hjg_Print#1=2) for those that want to purchase it. I updated the work so it doesn't have my artist info anymore. I'm still looking for a vendor through where I can hopefully make it more affordable for you guys, so if anyone knows of a good one, let me know! Don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any questions about purchases either. If you guys just want to check out some more stuff I tend to post online, [here's my portfolio](http://mconpictures.com)

**EDIT:** I'm still not really awake at the moment because of the all-nighter I just pulled earlier, so this might all come out a bit weird. This is the first time that one of my artworks has gotten this much recognition and feedback, so I'm still in a phase of "HOLY SHIT" right now. 

I know that r/breakingbad implemented rules for artwork to be diverted to another subreddit. Since the mods do say they "may make an exception" for certain works, I wanted to take a shot at it, but this is honestly more than I could have asked for. 

For those of you asking about purchasing it, I want to try making that doable. I'll try having something set up by the end of today. I want to make sure it's in a good enough quality to be printed first, so I'm going to work on sorting that out. I do have a society6 account, but if anyone knows of another similar way to sell artwork online, let me know. I like society6, but I don't know how I feel about the prices. I want you guys to be able to buy it affordably, so I'll take the best route I can find to do that.

Seriously, the fact that there's people out there that want to own something I worked on myself is still something I'm trying to comprehend. Thanks again, everyone.


**Original post:** Yo, guys. I don't know how to say it, but thank you for the response to this, the criticism, everything. I uploaded this after finishing a 10 page essay and this is insane to wake up to after a sad attempt at two hours of sleep before class. I just keep refreshing the page right now because I honestly didn't think this would be getting hits or generating discussion at all that quickly. 


I promise i'll be responding to each one of you personally when i get out of class because you guys made my morning a lot less stressful. I feel too grateful. Thanks for all the feedback!



 




 The bulk of this was drawing Walter digitally.  I had renditions done first of him in every form of appeareance he took on. What ended up in this was mainly full on Heisenberg and Mr. Lambert. The coloration came afterward, and then I messed around (and perhaps got carried away) with layering it and distorting it from different angles. I've been obsessing over Metal Gear Solid artwork for a while now, so this got my graphic novel/cyberpunk inspiration running wild. 


Thank you so much, by the way! 














 Calm down, guys. Let's not start any treble here.  









 This all seems like it's about to come down to a conflict between Jesse, Hank, and Walter. I think the [painting](http://i.imgur.com/LAOANQ1.png) at Hank's house is about to show significance. 




 This is absolutely heartbreaking. 




 guys its the internet 









 If the CGI looks even just as good as it does here, I'll be sold on this approach to the big guy. It's a difficult task finding a way to bring the iconic "man in suit" look Godzilla's had for over 50 years, and working it into a movie that has to appeal to audiences in an age of high-budget sci-fi films focused mostly on computer generated VFX. 




 I'm 21, so I'm only a student right now. But besides my parents, our entire extended family lives overseas, so I get to visit places near in and near the Middle East every three years or so. This was my first time visiting Saudi Arabia, however.


Honestly, I'm incredibly lucky and fortunate to even have the chance to visit those places. I'm thankful that I get to see my cousins as often as I get to. 




 Mecca. In Saudi Arabia. It's connected to a hotel and directly faces Masjid Al-Haram, which is known as the holiest Islamic landmark in the world. 




 Yes sir. '05. 




 It'd be awesome if you guys put up screenshots of what they look like on your phone, by the way. I love the fact that other people out there like my work enough to want to keep it as a background. I'll have more for you guys soon! 




 Right on! Took it from a parking garage near the Riverwalk.  




 Got it taken care of. That picture was from a month or so back. I put together a new one just to ease everyone's mind, hah


...except for the SRS light. That's next week.

 This is pretty much a subreddit for all mobile wallpapers. Not just iPhones. 




 As a PSA for everyone, get your hands on VSCO Cam right now if you can as well. They're giving it for free because of a new update, and they have a promotional cut from $16 to $6 going on for their entire IAP bundle. It's worth shelling out the money for. The best results for me came from that app. Afterlight's been my go to editing app for a long time as well. Both are awesome.


Glad to hear they look good so far! I'm on a jailbreak and waiting for the OS to be finalized before I get it, so I was a bit nervous about how the pictures would look on iOS 7. I can't wait to see how they came out on the parallax. 




 I don't mind at all! You can use my twitter handle if you'd like. @drcon 




 If you're losing interest in your own work, then you know you've been staring at them too long on your own by now. You don't even really need Reddit to start with. Show them to close friends. Post them on your social networking profiles. Feedback from good friends, family and anyone around you is a big step forward. 

Making a website to build a portfolio out of them once you've really learned a few techniques and have a few sets of photos to work off of comes later on. Post them to reddit for feedback and criticism, whereever appropriate.

[r/photography](http://reddit.com/r/photography) has some great links to tips and guides on building on your work, if you want to check it out. 




 Thank you guys tremendously for the feedback. I'm glad to know that these were pretty well received. I'll try putting together another set in the coming few weeks! 




 Sure thing, man! This isn't really iPhone sized, but it is my favorite shot I've taken of the skyline. Let me know if you want me to size it for an iPhone.

Afterlight is great too, if you want a fast, clean, and cheap editing program. It works great with Instragram. 




 I take them because I like taking them. I tried doing photography as a job, but then it just made me hate it so I stopped. Now I just carry my phone with me and capture anything I find worth shooting, and i love it. It becomes an addiction when you know you don't need an SLR to make something cool every day.


Also for karma.

 14 was a worm's eye view of the inside of a dome of Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina. I had the opportunity to see it while I was in Saudi Arabia. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. 




 [2](http://i.imgur.com/h5in1HU.png), [5](http://i.imgur.com/BLQGnLQ.jpg), and [23](http://i.imgur.com/nLsniSk.jpg) are of downtown Dubai. The one of the building was right next to the Burj Khalifa.

[10](http://i.imgur.com/Yq8bsFS.jpg) and 12-18 were taken in Saudi Arabia. I was there last March. Some of the pictures in the album are of Masjid al-Nabawi and al-Haram, from the inside and outside. If you see the b w shot of the man walking under large umbrellas, those are put out there to keep people under the shade outside the mosque. It's amazing to see. The pictures don't do those places justice.

The shot of the [mountains](http://i.imgur.com/8eGiIvah.jpg) was taken in switzerland, somewhere in the alps. The rest were a collection of shots from Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas. Dallas is where I currently live. I'm really glad you guys like these. I'll make sure I post more soon!
 




 Mostly the default camera. A few were shot with Camera+, and I touched them up using VSCO Cam and Afterlight. 









 Anytime! Here's my [website](http://mconpictures.com) if you want to check out some more work I do. :) 




 If there's one thing that Dallas has taught me, though, it's that you can find a good shot in anything you see around you. Even home. Keep a sharp eye out for what you find beauty out there and the pictures you take will follow your cue. And thank you, I really appreciate that, my friend!

 This song has such a sick beat. I really do think *A Thousand Suns* gets too overlooked. It's their best album, in my opinion. 




 I thought it'd have been said by now, but **Recovery** by Eminem. 

No moping, no self-loathing; just all out "I'm getting back where I should be" kinda feel when I listen to it. And 25 to Life was genius. 




 I made a mistake in the title: this is the oldest established university that's *still in continuous operation,* not the oldest university in the history of ever. Sorry!

 I noticed the blurriness too. It's a bummer. I thought the OIS would be more helpful in fixing that problem, but it's still really apparent in this phone. Either way, it hasn't really bothered me, but fixing that would have made this camera near-perfect. 




 Hey, John. Big fan, so thanks for your work.

You were considered for the role of Walter White in Breaking Bad. What ended up happening there to where you ended up not playing him? Bryan Cranston's done phenomenal, but I think you would have given the character an entirely new flesh.  














 Maybe next time I can try getting the point across without saying as much. Not that I didn't try here either.  




 That title describes exactly what the post is about. Did I admit that it's got a cheesy title to make the post more accessible for people? Yeah. But I don't see how that's me admitting it's a misleading title.

Whether it's blogspam is up to you to decide. I can't upvote this more than once, even if I tried. I put it up to hopefully help someone out there that could use a few tips, and I'm guessing a few people did find it useful.  









 *"In just 5 minutes, this young man will change how you view your life forever."* 




 I should have been a bit more clear. The biggest reason I haven't been able to use the 5D for a while is because a lot's been going in terms of school hours, LSAT stress, and work issues. I haven't been able to focus on photography as much as I used to. Having an iPhone 5 (and then eventually an LG G2) helped fill that void since it's something I always have on me either way. 

It wasn't because of the iPhone 5 that I stopped using the Mark II. But I did start using the phone more when I had to stop using it.  




 I was focusing more on scenic photography when writing that article. When you're at something like a dinner with friends and you want to get a group photo taken, I don't care at all about using the flash. Someone else commenting on the article brought up the iPhone 5S as a good example. Flash can be helpful as hell when it's used at the right time.

It's the same way using flash on a DSLR is appropriate when you're shooting something like a wedding. That would be different from taking taking a picture of a scene you want to capture in its natural look. 




 Hey, guys! I'm the author of this article. I just needed to address a few things:

This isn't really an article I wrote for photographers. I wrote this for people that don't know anything at all about photography. A lot of my friends that want to do some photog as a hobby don't tend to have actual cameras. I wrote this for them as some basic tips so they could get a kickstart with their phones, at least.

The way I see it is most of the time people don't tend to think of their phone as an actual camera so they just treat it like a point-and-shoot, where they would probably try going into learning more about actual photography tips if they had a DSLR. I remember treating every picture I took on my phone like that before I started using a Canon.  




 *I FORGOT ABOUT AFTERLIGHT.*

Ever since moving to Android, I've been waiting for it to come out on that. Afterlight is fantastic too, but I wouldn't use it for filters. The editing tools are what I love on it. They're the best I've seen on an app. I always took my photos for editing there, and then to VSCO for the finish. But yeah, Afterlight is definitely worth it.

As for the filter pack, look through VSCO's website and see how they describe the filters and what they're typically used for. It gave me a lot of ideas to start off with. A really useful thing I've also learned is if you've got a bit of noise noticeable in your picture, choose a filter that has a good fade to it. It takes out the noise and gives it your photo a more solid look.

 




 I don't regret it one bit. I was ready to buy them again when I realized I didn't have my purchases transfer from iPhone to Android until I found a way to restore them. 




 I really should have included this one. I never leave my house without a lens cloth now. 




 In theory, yeah. I targeted it towards smartphone users because it's the most common demographic. It's meant to be a short basic set of guidelines for people that wanna get a kickstart into photography with what they've got. 

...Hence the Buzzfeed-sounding title.. which I'll admit with guilt. Marketing classes.
 




 [You'll use it.. when I say you'll use it.](http://i.imgur.com/BNZELhP.jpg) 




  Color balance. If there are people in your pictures, do them a favor and move the color balance to the right (warm) 2 or 3 ticks. It will improve their skin tone especially if your photo was taken under harsh light.

There's also a skin tone pack you can download for free! It adds a skin tone adjustment in the editing tools. I've been using it every time i have a picture with faces. 




 I'm on the LG G2 here. I literally use this phone for almost everything now.  




 Yeah, a lot of my friends that want to do some photog as a hobby don't tend to have actual cameras. I wrote this for them as some basic tips so they could get a kickstart with their phones, at least.

I remember treating every picture I took on my phone like that before I started using a Canon. 




 Oh, hell yeah. When you're at something like a dinner with friends and you want to get a group photo taken, that thing is amazing. I was focusing more on scenic photography when writing that article.  




 Any progress is always progress. There's so many times I feel embarrassed when I compare my work to the things I see other people doing online. That's what drives me to get better at what I do; knowing there's always someone better. 




 An artist is someone who practices forms of expression through different mediums. Synonyms for the word 'artist' include 'creator' and 'originator'.

There's no specific guidelines to what makes something art. We're all artists, and we can only become better at it by working on us. What I wrote in that blog were just small guidelines and steps that someone can take in order to get themselves in the hang of the game. If your pictures aren't turning out like the way you see it, then build on it and find a way that works for you. You can't lose from there. You only lose when you tell yourself you're incapable of it. 














 It's awesome. I'm really biased towards stock Google android, so I wanted to get the Nexus 5. But put a custom rom in the G2, and it runs like a beast. As for the stock LG software that comes with it, it's still powerful. It depends on what you prefer when it comes to software, but in terms of hardware, this phone is more than enough for my uses. 




 I'm an idiot. Sorry, guys. It being 6 AM when I uploaded this after exam cramming must have gotten me. This is I-35.

 I love your interpretation of it. I took a lot of time to focus on the differences in color each rendition. The last one of him was the palest because he felt like such a ghost by the end of it; at least to me!

 Hi, Mr. Hanks. Let me start off by saying that you're my absolute favorite. It's not even funny how much of an impact you've made in my life, from childhood to adulthood, so thank you for that.

What is one movie role out there today that you would have taken in a heartbeat if it were offered to you?
 




 Here's a look at the original sketches used for this. http://i.imgur.com/RviqwKf.jpg 









 I literally just had the first three sales of my art career today. Thank you so much, man! I'm really glad you liked it. Knowing things like that is one of the biggest things that keeps me focused on getting better with every piece of work I do. 

I really hope that print comes out amazingly in XL! :) 




 The updated artwork on the link should have no more of the artist text. Thanks for pointing that out. 




 I'm not that happy about those price tags either. I'm still trying to find a viable way for you guys to be able to buy it and being able to afford it at the same time. So far, that website's been the best I can find. I'll let you know as soon as I find a way for the prices to drop! 




 Good question. I just realized that may look out of place on a large print. I'll update the site with a print free of that text. I think it'll just be replaced with a small transparent signature. Thanks for bringing that up.  




 Thank you for the feedback on it! I had the file set at a printable resolution and sent it to my Society6 account. They automatically select the size ranges that the file's suitable for, so all the ones that are doable should be shown there. I'll be using it as the vendor for now, so [here's the link](http://society6.com/Maazcon/Chemistry-Hjg_Print#1=2) to it. Thank you for your feedback on it too, by the way! 
























 The great thing about it going to Netflix was how much creative freedom was given to the show itself. Normally, we'd assume it'd be a complete risk to take a show to a streaming company, but Kevin Spacey and David Fincher didn't even hesitate. 

I really hope Netflix grabs more projects like this.

 Nah, I just put that there as a draft. The logo's meant to be standalone when it all comes down to it. As for the monochrome, that's the big thing I'm trying to solve right now. 

Edit: by standalone, i mean that I'll have 'Art   Politik' written and placed differently to complement how the logo is sized and placed itself. 




 Awkward. That is a P... 




 Thanks for that. I also found /r/Logo_Critique. I'll give both of them a shot.

 Hah, I wouldn't say it was awful! It definitely needed work on keeping consistent with how emotionally ignited the opening scenes were, but the script still managed to keep people seated with what it offered.  But damn, they really should have utilized Cranston and Watanbe more.

Thanks for the feedback! 




 He did. The context is that he started realizing he was losing heart for it as filming was taking place. There's a quote by him from a biography cited on my page if you want to read exactly what he said.  














 I'm with you on that. As much as I'll criticize that movie, The Lost World is an irreversible staple in my childhood. I just watched it again a few weeks ago after finishing the book, and I still love it. 

The movie's got its glaring flaws, but it doesn't mean we can't enjoy it for what it is. That scene with Julian Moore was pure classic Spielberg. From all the summer movies that come out these days, I found myself appreciating scenes like that a lot more.

 I completely agree with you. I hope I didn't come off as otherwise. I didn't mean to say that photographers shouldn't act like that because it endangers rights; I was only writing about how it does.

When I was writing it, I used the paparazzi as more of an example to remind us that we need to watch how we act when we shoot in public. It was to show that we need to remember to be respectful because doing otherwise just makes us look bad and hypocritical. I pointed out the danger it has to rights to show a secondary consequence of it as well; that's why I had the title include that the activities of paparazzi are dangerous for 'photographers *and* their rights'.

Hey. I have one song that I finished production and vocals on just last summer. I haven't been able to work more on music because of school and work, but I'd like having a mastered copy of that track, at least. It'd be great for it to get a bit of publicity. 




 You just have a very condescending phone.

 Thanks! Represent.

 Your photography is sick. It's great to see you reach out to your fans like this. Rock on, man! 




 WAS GETTING CAUGHT PART OF YOUR PLAN? 




 Thanks for that. Exactly what I've been thinking every time I go back to this. 

I noticed you've got a track up too. I'll check it out in a bit! 




 Do you mean the delivery itself, or the effects put on it? I'll be honest; back when I did this, it was the first time I ever did vocals on one of my tracks, so I've got a lot of work to do there.  




 [MCON - Dogs of War](https://soundcloud.com/maazcon/dogs-of-war) 

This is the first and only full song I've completed so far. I'd love some feedback from you guys on it while I'm working on newer tracks. Just hearing what others think helps me out. 




 It's got an amazing drumline, man. I think it'd sound incredible if you highered your bass when the vocals hit. 




 I'm really feeling the sample. Try toning it down just a bit though, so your drums can get heard more clearly!

 Hey, guys. I'm the original artist behind the picture. I'm still building a website to put my full portfolio, so I don't exactly have one yet, but you can check out my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/maazcon) for now. 

I didn't realize this was getting posted in other subreddits until now. It's awesome to see it get this much feedback. I'll be back with more. Thank you guys! 




 You guys are awesome. Don't think i forgot to answer the rest of you; I'll be back soon. Thanks so much for the feedback! 




 I've got a it at a higher resolution on the website. I still can't guarantee it'll be the best quality because the source image had to be more blown up, but It shouldn't have any artifacts. I put up the [print of it here](http://i.imgur.com/mlueCDW.jpg) so you can test it out before going for it. If anyone's a bit uneasy about this, I'd say to check that link because it's the size for the poster. And if anyone has tips on correcting anything, then tell me as soon as possible because I can update the site before anything ships if it's soon enough. Thanks! 




 Year Zero was all that was playing in my head while making this. 




 Just put it up on Society6. This is the only way I have so far for selling artwork, so I'm sorry if the prices are a bit high. If anyone knows about a better way to distribute prints, please let me know. 

http://society6.com/maazcon/the-airstrike_print#1=45 




 No way? I literally just titled my last piece "The Radiator" ten minutes ago. 

That's a really cool way to look at it. It reminds me of the way the camera messes up at the [end of this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRCR6onaASU). 




 I do if people ask!

I have a [shop up on society6.com](http://society6.com/maazcon) where I sell a few, but I can't speak for how good it'll come out since I don't make the prints myself. The prices there are also a bit on the high end so I'm sorry for that in advance. 

If anyone knows a better way to distribute prints, then please let me know.  But until then, I'll be putting the artwork up there as soon as it's ready! 




 I do this thing where I take a picture of something mundane and try making something out of it. Whatever I've got in my head at the point, I try making it look like that. So this one started off as a picture of a telephone pole outside my house. And for me it ended as the view of a city under attack. 

But you probably saw something different, and that doesn't make you understand this any less! I'd rather you saw it your own way, because that's just awesome to think about. 




 It makes me happy that this got to be the exception! Thanks, buddy. 




 NAW YOU FUCKING MAGNIFICENT. 




 This one's by me. I'm still working on a website for a portfolio, so I don't really have a page I put my work up on. The closest thing I can give is my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/maazcon) feed for now.

Just a note: I'm not really in the business of selling work right now; I usually put my work up if someone requests to buy it. Problem is that I currently don't have my own way to sell them, so I use Society6. If there's anyone out there that knows a more accessible way to  sell these prints, please let me know.

For now, I hope this way works out fine!

 Hey, man. Please send me a message. I want know more about you. Let's talk.  




 The scene with the Inferi deserved that PG-13 rating more than almost anything in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. 









 I was in Mecca recently, at the shops outside Masjid al Haram. There's guards posted up there outside the entrance to every building. Each of them just have a stern posture that makes them seem as unapproachable as any stereotypical guard you might think of. 

I'm walking past and see a frail old man walking up to the one of the mall's entrances. The guard there immediately broke his stance and smiled at the old man as he passed by. He smiled back. Not that big of a deal, but seeing respect like that made my day. 




 not with that attitude 




 I think you need to relax a bit. I posted this as a warning to be careful because of things like this, and not to rely on Sony if you screw up because they won't help you at all.

Go back and show me where I put the blame on Sony for any of this, because you're the one twisting my words up here.  




 I made sure to look up everything about the phone when it came to its warranty. Xperia phones have an international warranty, as long as you have a proof of purchase of the phone from the country it was sold in. 

What happened here was that my phone was shipped from the factory itself, and any phone that comes out of the factory and not from a Sony store is absolutely void of any warranty. Normally you'd be right here, but my phone has no warranty even in the country in which it was sold. 
 




 http://i.imgur.com/9wxz6Q2.jpg

Here's the best picture I could get of it. It comes off completely clean. I think the port was glued to it with an adhesive. There's no damage done to any of the parts.  




 It does have an international warranty. As long as you have the proof of purchase and what country the phone's originally from, the warranty still runs.  The problem is that my phone ended up being one of the phones that was shipped directly from a Sony factory instead of a Sony store. In the representative's words, the factory models come without any warranty. 

But the TLW you linked seems like it should apply here regardless. I'll try contacting them again and bring it up.  




 This entire ordeal really made me appreciate whenever I've dealt with Apple. I've had iPods replaced free of charge even if they were a bit past their warranty expiration. Sending a device in for a diagnostic didn't mean paying a fee, either.

Sony's got great phones, but it won't gain any new customers with support like this.  




 I recently purchased a Z1 Compact online from the US, since it isn't sold here. I bought it brand new from a seller through Newegg.com, and after using it for two months, the magnetic charging port got pulled out by the charging dock itself. 

Now, I've already been taking extra caution with my phone; dealing with overseas shipping for repairs or replacements would be another hassle on its own. This phone hasn't had a scratch on it since I've gotten it, and of all things that ended up defective, it was the magnetic charging port.

I called technical support, and I was told that my phone had no warranty at all after giving the IMEI number because it was from a Hong Kong factory. I've searched everywhere online for this policy, and I haven't found anything about it. I was told to send it in for an evaluation (with a $25 fee) to figure out how much it would cost to repair it.

When I asked the rep if there's any way at all for a Sony center in the US to help me out with repairing the phone, her response was:

"That is actually something that we don't (but should) have access to. Sony has not compiled a map or even a list of authorised locations for Sony Repair."

The Z1 Compact is a great phone, but the sad reality is that owning one in the US means you'll barely have support for it at all. There's a lot of people out there that want to buy the Z2, as well, so I just wanted to give this as a warning: wherever you buy it from, make sure it's coming officially through Sony. They're incredibly strict as it is when it comes to warranty, and if you're not covered, you're going to end up paying for everything.

And if you do get it from a reseller online, most of them offer their own warranties hat cover accidental damage, as well. BUY THE COVERAGE. Now that I'm finding out my Z1 Compact has absolutely no warranty from Sony at all, I'm regretting not getting the reseller's coverage while I had the chance.

**TL;DR: If you're in the US, be careful when buying an Xperia Z1/Compact/Z2 from overseas. Get any third-party warranty coverage if you can. Don't ever rely on Sony for warranty support, and put a case on that phone as soon as you get it.**
