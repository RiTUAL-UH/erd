 No, not at all! He's just a jokester 




 Thanks a lot! 









 Is there an official tier list? 




 Does anyone know how to make the score list that long? 




 You have your hobbies, and we have ours 




 Friday because everybody is lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend 




 Pokmon because I HAVE TO CATCH 'EM ALL 




 Off-topic, how did you get the score chart to show every score instead of just eight with a scroll bar? 




 It's all fun and games until a deer head falls on you. 




 Pichu and Daisy 




 Off topic, but what is that box with all of the civilizations' emblems at the bottom of the screen, and how do you enable it?

 Are the mega evolutions likely to be final smashes? 




 Do the 3ds pictures just look like this because it is supposed to be "3d" or will they actually have a different appearance than the wii u game?

 I don't see the Ice Climbers there 
























 I found it!!!!! Ten years later 




 This is the same exact situation with me ._. 




 If my calculations are correct, you've spent over an hour and a half on the game every day since release. 




 At least his picture is smiling :) 




 Came for comments about #14 in blue.

Was satisfied. 




 I was just joking haha. I like the new ideas in the game

 They should replace Beyonc with Solange 




 I think that's what it was in mk7 




 Oh that makes sense! 




 My Neopets are all basic, but what trade would I expect to get for a green Aisha named Vyfy? 




 What does that mean? 




 It seems odd that there are only 3 ATVs when there are so many karts and bikes. It also seems odd that there are so many lightweight characters. 




 OMG! 




 Haha, Jake didn't even hear that Carson asked him to introduce Tim McGraw. "Love you guys!" 




 I don't get why people are saying it's cheating since it was before the live show even started. 




 But i like Mario Party :( 




 I think its with every copy of the game 




 Wind Waker HD since I have all the others 




 Oh okay, thanks! 




 So does the replay not show the whole race? 




 Why does 150 CC look so easy? :(

 Do a lot of people actually not like him? (Besides on here) 




 I wouldn't get one if you were only interested in one game. However, you are interested in three games with a lot of play time without getting bored, so I would

 That's what they're thinking

 I am thinking about trading my 4L Pirate Krawk for a WN Woodland Xweetok. Is this a fair trade? 
























 Um, have you not seen the Spongebob Squarepants movie? 




 It's one of my favorites! 




 If you have a 3DS, get Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Your characters can visit each other and you can play mini games, watch stars, etc., and it's like you are on a real date! 




 You should post this to /r/wiiu and maybe /r/nintendo to get more responses 




 You're my new favorite person 




 People on /r/smashbros do, at least  




 Well, who doesn't do that? 




 Do you know the tier of schools where kids who excel in classes and tests but not in extracurriculars should apply considering it is so competitive at places like Harvard?

 It just feels wrong to me that there are water and fire but no grass starters 




 Someone has a case of the angries today! 




 There's actually 38 




 I like seeing fan art though. :( 




 Does this mean there can only be 8 players at once? 




 I honestly think that the characters who have been in only pictures or in videos for a split second (like Game and Watch) are going to be the "hidden" characters of the game. 




 Rhode Island? 




 Woooo! Happy birthday us! 




 Me! We all must unite! 




 Yeah! 




 Thanks! 




 The 30th! 




 General consensus seems to point to Fire Emblem as a first choice! And if I can get any more games, it looks like I should decide between Kid Icarus, Wonderful 101, and Donkey Kong. Thanks for the responses so far! 




 Is it easy to find online matches? 




 Okay, thanks! And I have a question on Kirby, did you think it was too easy of a game? I've read that in a few reviews 




 I'm definitely considering fire emblem now as it seems to be a well-liked game! And I love Animal Crossing as well! 




 Thanks! Is earthbound a virtual console game? 




 I'm going to get a few games for my birthday, but I am not sure which ones to ask for! I am considering the following:

Fire Emblem: Awakening

Kirby: Triple Deluxe

Mario Golf World Tour

Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze

Kid Icarus: Uprising

Wonderful 101
 




 Yeah it is probably a good way to measure intelligence within your own school, but who knows the different teaching styles and difficulty levels between schools? 




 I think you would have to be reasonably smart to get a 33. I don't think that just being able to find context clues constitutes getting almost every answer right. 




 It's okay, I appreciated your post 




 Ai-Ai! 




 "Double ya" (w) 




 Yay! What does that mean 




 I think my life is complete now 




 I'm going to download this for my ~~boy~~ girl character.

 You can type in the Pokemon you want on GTS if you go to the bottom of the alphabet list 




 Which one besides Washington and Oregon? 




 Thanks! 




 Does anyone know how to fix this? Peach literally jumps in the air and then floats back down without doing anything. 




 No presents?? Why? :( 




 You could just give them to me 




 You can do that? That seems unfair LOL! 




 If I reset my game to choose a different starter, can I get another shiny Beldum? Or could I just transfer it to Pokmon Bank and then onto my new game even if I delete my old save file? 




 Okay, I will preorder king DeDeDe, Ike, and probably Toon Link anyway. 




 Would it be a good idea to preorder some wave 3 amiibo online? 




 Oh I thought it was an online game or something and I thought there might not be many people online 




 That's what I was afraid of. 




 Is it still worth getting now? 




 YOU DONT GET IT 




 Well honestly I don't blame them if someone called them a geek. It hurts your feelings.  




 Thanks LOL 




 What is it like against all CPUs? 




 Is it worth it to get Smash U now if I have Smash 3D? I am definitely going to get Smash U, but I am wondering if I should just wait and ask for it for Christmas from my family. 




 Yay, CPUs! #nofriendswhoplay #ormaybejustnofriends 




 Thanks! 




 I am currently debating spending an extra $50. 




 What's the title for the matchup? 




 I play soccer, and the season is almost over since it's winter. I don't have anything to do besides homework. What do you guys do during winter (sports, hobbies, etc.)? 




 How long did they take to arrive after you got the shipping confirmation? 




 Can there be ai in smash tour? 




 Betsy (for Ganondorf) 




 I read something about if you plug your ds in like it's charging, the lag isn't as bad. if you want to try that. 









 I mean, I'll take it if you don't want it. 




 So can you only play this when you streetpass someone? 




 What if I play on all three teams?
