McGILLAN, JOHN M. "SHORTY" - Delirium Tremens - Died Aug 22, 1891 - Age 30 Years  

He Never Blamed the Booze! 

His liver needed scraping and his kidneys had the gout, He swallowed lots of bitters 'til at last he cleaned 'em out, His legs were swelled with dropsy 'til he had to cut his shoes, He blamed it to the doctors, but he never blamed the booze! 

Then he had the tremens, and he tackled rats and snakes, First he had the fever, then he had the shakes, At last he had a funeral and the mourners had the blues, And the epitaph they carved him ..."He Never Blamed the Booze!"

"An advisory alert has been issued for a remote  volcano in the western Aleutian Islands after dozens of earthquakes were reported in the area, an early sign of volcanic unrest. 

The change means that five volcanoes being monitored in Alaska are now simultaneously active, the most in recent memory, said Matt Haney, a research geophysicist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. "

Too many quakes from Indonesia to the southern Islands, Chile, Acapulco and volcano related swarms in the Aleutians.

 /r/StormComing is simply this: an Archive of Earth Changing Disasters and Events, manmade or natural.

It's not a place for HAARPtards, Climate Change Deniers, Flat-Earthers, or Eschatology/Rapturists to post theorems. And as we want to attract sane, logical redditors, we don't want to hear about how radiation is good for everyone.

This sub is best read using 'new' rather than 'hot' or 'top' as it is an archive of events.

We cover these types of global stories:

* Extreme Weather (including watches/warnings), torrential rains, record breaking wind events, temperatures, tornados, hurricanes, etc.

* Geologic: Landslides, earthquakes, sinkholes, etc.

* Floods and flood watches/warnings.

* Solar: Solar Storms that may have impact on Earth.

* Disease: Disease outbreaks of all kinds, including rabies threats.

* Food Recalls.

* Near Earth Objects: Upcoming close encounters with Meteors.

* Mass animal die-offs.

* Nuclear accidents and events.

* Oil and chemical spills/explosions/fires.

* Wildfires.

* Drought and impacts of drought, ie: agricultural impacts, etc.

If you want to add an Earth-changing or disaster story from the news or reliable source, please do. Since headline writers often fail, feel free to editorialize titles to fill in important details from the story- especially the location.

We have already heard from someone who saw a flash flood forecast here that saved them from swimming home from work. Other redditors have been alerted to Tornado Outbreaks and took safety precautions. So we feel we are fulfilling the purpose of the sub.

As /r/StormComing is an archive of events, there is nothing subjective about it. Downvoting anything here would be as stupid as downvoting an encyclopedia entry.

Feel free to x-post to other reddits, especially reddits that are geographically related to the area the event or warning concerns.

If you mod a related sub I'll be happy to share sidebar links. If you would like to co-mod this sub, send me a pm.

 Over the past year I have been noting rainfall records broken worldwide. People describing these events use the words: torrential, apocalyptic, unusual, extraordinary. I remember an elderly Japanese lady describing one such event (in Japan last year) in this way "The water was coming down so hard I could barely breathe, I felt like I was breathing water."

As stated, I started noting a drastic increase in these events last year- out of past 40 years of serious weather watching. 

[Here is the post I made on it 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/1jzh7q/unheard_of_rains_861388_2013_a_few_samples/).

----------------------

Note from Kolby:

The anomalous movement of the Jet Stream continues to reflect the findings of Jennifer Francis (Rutgers) and her associates. 

In a nutshell: that warming in the Arctic is creating deeper meandering loops in the Jet Stream (Rossby Theory) and that this is *slowing* the Jet Stream, leading to 'stuck' highs and cut off lows. In other words, weather systems that would quickly pass or not be as intense are now intense and longer lasting. For example: two weeks of intense rain instead of an hour or a day. These deeper loops are also pulling in weather systems from deeper south or farther north.

Great little explanatory video: http://youtu.be/_nzwJg4Ebzo

In this case, it is superheated air being pulled up into the UK from Spain by a deep 'loop' in the Jet Stream.

 I have a good friend I have been gaming with for some time. He is an Iraq War Vet who did 6 tours. He cannot work now and lives in a very tiny town. He very much relies on his friendships in Warcraft for companionship and to provide 'something to do every day' in his life. 

His old laptop completely quit a few days ago and he has a HP Pavilion DV6 2057 cl - that he has been trying to get the game downloaded to ever since. He says it just needs a hard drive, but I think it is too old. It keeps giving him an error that states the Javascript cannot be found and another message about the graphics card being out of date.

I desperately want to do something but am in an extremely tight spot, financially. I don't even have a tree this year. 

I am heartsick that he will be spending the holidays 'alone' more or less. I thought about requesting assistance from his online friends- but he is very proud and would be upset if I did so. He needs a hard drive for the HP or even a cheap laptop that is just good enough to run the game. 

Any assistance or advice would be highly appreciated.  Thank you very much in advance.

To clarify, I posted disturbing images of health officials leaving the Ebola patients apartment in Dallas- making comparisons to recent images. 

I posted to /r/Stormcoming, x-posted to /r/Dallas   /r/texas 

The Stormcoming was immediately upvoted . 

The Dallas and Texas posts were immediately- within minutes of posting- downvoted to oblivion.

This is not something you would expect from regular redditors who want to know what the hell is going on in their areas and would have no reason to want to hide anything. 

Now I see the one on /r/Stormcoming is getting hammered.

Wtf is going on here? 







































 A few days ago- right after the Dallas Ebola patient was diagnosed, [this image was in the news.](http://static2.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1961092.1412271234!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/ebola.jpg) It shows 'Dallas Health Officials leaving the Ebola patients apartment'. 

([from this news story](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/80-people-dallas-monitored-ebola-article-1.1960700))

They are in normal business wear. There is no 'clean' station in sight, no hazmat, no gloves, not even shoe booties. You can assume from here they got in their cars and went back to the office, maybe stopping for coffee or lunch along the way; who knows?

Now today we see [this story.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/dallas-ebola-case-spurs-concern-about-hospital-readiness/2014/10/03/4afa10b2-4b30-11e4-a046-120a8a855cca_story.html?tid=pm_national_pop)

I found it fascinating that 'before the gate of Lud' Jesus will kill Satan. This is in Islamic lore. The town is called Lydda now- but the Gate of Lud still stands. I am going to explore more about this today.

But it is sadly ironic that people would try to block others from learning of a really interesting connection. Especially when a clear trend in Kings stories that the characters with blinding, personal dogmas tend to be the true villains.

 Kristie Baugus Moon was dating Michael Pearcy when she disappeared 10/27/1999. [According to her mother, he was the last one to see her.](http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/m/moon_kristie.html) 

In 2001, Sherrif Ron Wyatt and his partner stopped Michael Pearcy.

["Wyatt and his partner stopped a car driven by Michael Pearcy who was wanted for questioning by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation."](http://www.bpnews.net/4392/bivocational-pastor-recovers-from-roadside-shooting)

Michael Pearcy shot Sherrif Ron Wyatt and Wyatts partner then shot Michael Pearcy to death.

[Michael Pearcy is the son of Mark Pearcy- both Mark and Jeff Pearcy are under arrest for being accessories and accessories after the fact in the Holly Bobo kidnapping and murder.](http://www.wsmv.com/story/26480995/remains-found-in-decatur-co-belonged-to-holly-bobo)

It is difficult to find anything on Kristie Moon. It doesn't look like there were serious searches or investigations held. It's as if no one even wanted to acknowledge her disappearance. This is the exact opposite from the Holly Bobo kidnapping where hundreds of people turned out to search and the police held numerous press conferences.

Here is where it gets strange. Sheriff Wyatt, in three different interviews over the years (all before the Bobo kidnapping), has given three different explanations as to why he pulled over Michael Pearcy. Once for 'bad tail light' and once because Pearcy had been "doing something illegal earlier in the day." The original article states that Wyatt pulled Michael Pearcy over because he was wanted for questioning by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Which I presumed was over the disappearance of Kristie Moon. 

Now from the Associated press - a statement by Sheriff Wyatt thats a jaw dropper:

["Rita Foley with The Associate Press said that Sheriff Wyatt never expected something like this to happen in the small tight-knit community. He was visibly shaken by the news of Holly's disappearance."](http://www.examiner.com/article/holly-bobo-big-city-crime-comes-to-small-tight-knit-community-safety-tips)

Excuse me? This sheriff was shot by Michael Pearcy, the suspect in the disappearance of Kristie Moon and son of one of the guys busted in the Bobo kidnapping. 

And Sheriff Wyatt acts all surprised, like nothing like this had ever happened in Parsons, Tennessee?

Why did Wyatt give several reasons why he pulled over Michael Pearcy in the first place? Was the TBI investigating Pearcy in Kristies disappearance? It's very hard to dig up any information on this. 

We can't ask Sheriff Wyatts partner- he was killed a few weeks later while investigating a car wreck.

I just know that something stinks to high heaven in Parsons, TN.

Pheonix = 'supposedly'.  




 What the fuck language is that?
 




 Being stopped for no reason is humiliating and destroys police-community relationship.

I remember being taught in school that we were fighting the Cold War because in 'those evil countries' the police could stop people on the street for no reason, spy on them, arrest them on the smallest pretense. We went to Vietnam supposedly to prevent the spread of that behavior around the world. My beloved Uncle died for this. Now to see it codified into law and todays law enforcement officers performing it is both enraging and deeply saddening. 

Stop- just stop. This is not fascist/soviet Russia.

3. What is the origin of unique, advanced technologies that are discovered on occasion (such as the [Antikythera Mechanism](http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr))?

4. What is the origin of similar ancient stories of massive wars that occurred on earth, many of which involved [air transit and nuclear type damage](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/23630-ancient-atomic-bombs/), such as the Indian Vedas. 

I have been considering this since the 1990's.  




 So I was watching [a video on youtube of police officers shooting a pregnant woman](https://youtu.be/UKJZanyNUhE) who had a knife. 
I am always interested in comments and saw this interchange between Russians, and translated it:

   **Once again, afraid so killed a man/woman shoot to kill, this nation can be defeated in less than a month**

 
*Roman Brovko 1 day ago*

   Executing = fright?

 
*Antonioni Bardzini 1 day ago*

   + Roman Brovko they could safely shoot in the legs but they always shot in the chest, let the will of man will kill.


So it is how I see this 'new generation' of police officers in the U.S.. They can't manage themselves and have a strong streak of cowardice- and so they use the gun. Interesting that others, including these Russians, now see American males as cowards.

**Attorney: North Charleston police officer felt threatened before fatal shooting**
-----------------------------------------------

Slager


A North Charleston police officer felt threatened last weekend when the driver he had stopped for a broken brake light tried to overpower him and take his Taser.

Thats why Patrolman 1st Class Michael Thomas Slager, a former Coast Guardsman, fatally shot the man, the officers attorney said Monday.

Investigators collect evidence after a North Charleston police officer fatally shot a man Saturday morning.

Slager thinks he properly followed all procedures and policies before resorting to deadly force, lawyer David Aylor said in a statement.

   This is a very tragic event for all of the families, Aylor said. I believe once the community hears all the facts of this shooting, theyll have a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding this investigation.

Mondays developments filled in some of the blanks in what was South Carolinas 11th police shooting of the year. Authorities publicly identified Slager, an officer with the city since December 2009, and gave his reason for the traffic stop that led to the fatal confrontation. Police documents also revealed that Slager announced within seconds why he had fired.

Shots fired, and the subject is down, he said into his radio, according to an incident report. He took my Taser.

Walter Lamer Scott, 50, of Meadowlawn Drive in West Ashley died soon after the encounter near Craig Street and Remount Road.

He has been arrested about 10 times in his lifetime, mostly for failure to appear for court hearings and to pay child support.

The only indicator of violence in his past came with his first arrest in 1987 on an assault and battery charge.

Slager, 33, served honorably in the military before joining the North Charleston Police Department more than five years ago, Aylor said.

*He has never been disciplined during his time on the force, the attorney added.*

Slager was on a boarding team when he served in the Coast Guard in Port Canaveral, Fla., his personnel file showed. The 91 pages of documents were released Monday after The Post and Courier filed a S.C. Freedom of Information Act request.

He passed courses on how to use the Taser X26 when he was hired in North Charleston and performed well on shooting tests with his .45-caliber Glock 21. Supervisors indicated in performance reviews that he met expectations as an officer and kept a tidy patrol car.

Of the two complaints in his file, one dealt with a residents allegation of unnecessary use of force.

Slager went to the mans Delaware Avenue home in September 2013 to investigate a burglary. When the resident opened the door for Slager, the burglary victim yelled that he wasnt the suspect, the documents stated.

The man also insisted that he wasnt the perpetrator, but he later told internal investigators that Slager threatened to use a Taser against him if he didnt come outside. When the man followed the order and stepped outside, he said Slager Tased (him) for no reason and ... slammed him and dragged him.

But another officer there said Slager had been forced to use the device during a struggle. The investigators exonerated Slager of wrongdoing.

Slager will keep working during a State Law Enforcement Division investigation into whether Saturdays shooting was justified, but Pryor said he would be on administrative duty.

While the police released Slagers file, one lawmaker said the episode again points out the need for body-mounted cameras whose footage can stave off community speculation.

The city is expected to get 115 of the devices through $275,000 in state funding for that and other anti-crime initiatives.

Rep. Wendell Gilliard, D-Charleston, said it cant come soon enough. Gilliard has authored legislation to require police agencies to outfit their officers with cameras. As an alternative, he also offered a bill calling for a study of such programs. But he expressed frustration because the measures had not advanced.

People will say Im using this (shooting) as a springboard, he said. But Ive said these types of incidents will continue, and when they do, its going to be unfortunate that we are not using modern-day technology to stop the speculation and rumors.

The authorities have not said whether anyone else saw Slagers struggle with Scott.

No one called Charleston Countys 911 Center after the gunfire, and Slagers communications with dispatchers will not be made public until SLED approves it, county spokeswoman Natalie Hauff said.

SLED spokesman Thom Berry said prosecutors also would have to review the recordings and be agreeable and amenable to their release.
Quickly escalated

North Charleston community leaders have mentioned the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in urging residents not to grow violent in light of Scotts death. But, like Missouri police said of Brown, Slager saw Scott as a threat when the officer decided to pull the trigger.

Around 9:30 a.m. Saturday, Slager noticed a Mercedes-Benz sedan with a brake light that was out and not working, the police spokesman said. He stopped his cruiser behind the sedan that had pulled into Advance Auto Parts at 1945 Remount Road.

What started out as a routine traffic stop quickly escalated after the driver fled, Slagers attorney said.

Scott ran down Craig Road, which parallels the stores parking lot and stretches southward toward the Singing Pines community. A passenger in his car stayed put.

Slager told other officers through his radio that he had gotten into a foot chase, according to the report. The police have not given details about the confrontation that followed behind the Mega Pawn shop at 5654 Rivers Ave.

But with other officers on the way to help, Slager announced on his radio that he had deployed his Taser, according to the report. But it didnt work.

The statement from Slagers attorney, though, did not say that Slager actually fired the device. Aylor said he could not offer further clarification until the officer talks with investigators.

When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser  as trained by the department  and then a struggle ensued, Aylor said. The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser.
Felt threatened

Seconds later, the report added, he radioed that the suspect wrested control of the device. Even with the Tasers prongs deployed, the device can still be used as a stun gun to temporarily incapacitate someone.

Slager felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon, his attorney added.

The report indicated that Slager fired multiple times, but it was not specific.

Backup officers did first aid and CPR on Scott until paramedics showed up. But Scott was pronounced dead.

Loved ones have said that Scott was a family man who recently got engaged. They insisted that he wasnt violent.

His most serious arrests came decades ago, according to his SLED rap sheet.

County police officers arrested him in 1987 on a charge of assault and battery, and he was convicted in 1991 of possession of a bludgeon.

Ten years passed before he was arrested twice in 2001 on contempt charges. He would face several similar charges occasionally during the next decade until his last arrest in 2012.

He also had convictions from 2008 for driving under suspension and having an open alcohol container in his car.

Anthony Scott met with the police near the scene soon after his brother was shot. The report did not specify, though, whether he had been the passenger in the Mercedes.

The police took his cellphone as evidence. The next day, he promised in a public statement to find out the truth about what happened.

 I will be posting warnings / reports through the day here as long as I can. 










































































 A large number of companies capture voice prints of anybody that calls them and have been doing so for a number of years. None of them disclose that they are capturing your voice print even though they allegedly are doing so as a form of two-factor authentication. Then they can associate that voice print with accounts, purchases, etc.


When combined with voice prints from other companies it becomes easier for something like the NSA to be able to identify an individual by voice print - they don't have to have their name - regardless of whose phone they may be using. Plus that allows them to associate that individual to the person whose phone they used. That would include identifying people speaking on conference room phones where many individuals can be speaking over the same line on the same call from the same phone.


If recording devices are built to produce voice recordings using the same telephone voice structure the intelligence agencies could then potentially identify all of the people speaking in a room for example without there being a phone at all if a listening device were there or nearby. 













































































































 I see more and more posters to this sub taking screenshots in dark, poorly lit places or worse, under colored lighting. No one can see the colors of the Op's x-mogs, rendering the post basically worthless.  

Leaves me wondering if the x-mogs in these dark, blurry, poorly lit screenshots look horrible or great. 

Now, get your toon to a nice, naturally lit area, (Dal, Elwynn, Jade Forest, Barrens, to name a few) zoom in so your toon is not 1/8th of an inch high in the pic and turn up your graphics. Click and post.

Thank you!!

Third text chat: Oh I meant 5'6". 

 




 The type is not the same and the flag bars are distressed on the target one. The colors are the same, but printing white on Black is very common.

Wow.. so this means [I could distress these circles a bit, switch up the font by a hairsbreadth](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v1/1604256868/Factory-directly-selling-Captain-America-superhero-tee-shirt-font-b-avengers-b-font-font-b-sign.jpg), print this shirt and sell it without license from Marvel Comics! It's just some generic circles and triangles.

 Creative directors (in my experience) are middle managers that know nothing about design.

Well just call me a unicorn. My experience is in the material arts in the 80's, graphic arts in the mid 90's, digital design experience leading to the founding 2 graphic arts and web design companies in NY. During this period I was a contracted as a writer and graphic arts developer for Jupiter Media (Graphics.com) and started designing advertising and developing marketing programs for the Palms in Vegas, among others. 

Then got an offer as Executive Creative Director with a company on the west coast. 

An Executive Creative Director that doesn't know design is like a doctor that doesn't know anatomy. 


 




 That *one* line in my post was in *response* to business-woman bashing. If you are smart enough to breathe and type at the same time you know that. If not, deal with it.  




 So are you saying that like;

"But usually they're retarded." ?

or 

"They type with their dicks." ? 




 And with resource shortages looming with climate change, keeping as many people poor as possible (less resource competition) while controlled and contained. This is my sneaking suspicion as to why they are militarizing local police forces. 




 The ones on high horses were the ones attacking this woman and casting unfounded and unreasonable accusations at her, when she was obviously wronged.

Coincidence? Did you even bother to go read the news articles or [look at the image](http://www.opposingviews.com/i/social/oregon-woman-finds-her-t-shirt-design-sold-target-without-her-permission)? It's exact. 

I isolated the design and did a google image compare: there are no designs out there exactly like this besides the one at Target. 

And 'it happens' is no excuse when fucking with someones livelihood. Kicking someone when they are already down, from the safety of your keyboard anonymity, is cowardly and horrendous.

It's' also clear to me that the design is copyrighted to her under the electronic copyright act.

Source: I am an Executive Creative Director. 




 Nope - she is very attractive: http://www.opposingviews.com/i/social/oregon-woman-finds-her-t-shirt-design-sold-target-without-her-permission

The only reason I even mentioned it was because of the neanderthalic "She needs to stfu and get back to the kitchen" sort of remarks. 




 No, assholes who kick people when they are down or on the basis of half-formed bullshit make reddit bad. I don't care if they are male, female or donkey.  




 "Absolutely not. In fact, I'd increase it if I could..because I could care less about this place or the people here. As long as I can keep paying for my 7 mansions in other places in the world, fuck California." 

Fixed it.  




 I was - 30 yrs ago. He stuck the bag in his pocket and sent me on my way. That moment killed my naivet about how the world really works. 




 Perfect OP name for this. 




 Why not? He can afford to live wherever he wants with the proceeds of fucking CA in the ass. And he certainly won't live someplace that is dried up. Same with all of these assholes who are profiting from wrecking the planet one area at a time.  




 http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/35pq9j/my_friend_who_sells_tshirts_through_etsy_found/ 




 Like the young woman yesterday who had her best selling t-shirt design obviously and without doubt being printed and sold by Target.

 Redditors viciously attacked her, attacked the design as 'ugly' and 'unoriginal' (as if their fine sense of aesthetics mattered), attacked everyone selling on Etsy, attacked Etsy itself, claimed repeatedly that she didn't have a leg to stand on (when attorneys in the news articles that said she *did* have a case). 

Worst of all the top poster, doing the usual shitty job of playing reddit detective, claimed that she ripped off the Tootsie Roll Indian (on another shirt). That design is actually over 80 yrs old and has been in public domain for years. Despite this being pointed out, hundreds of neck bearded assholes jumped on the bandwagon, calling her a thief and worse. They were so horrible that she literally pulled that shirt from her store. 

This lady is supporting her kids from her screen printing operation in her garage. And these fuckwads attacked her - viciously. 

For what? Being female? Starting her own business? For doing more with her life than whacking it in moms basement? It was inexcusable and inexplicable. You would have thought half the commenters worked for Target. I am wondering if it ended up having a negative impact on her livelihood. 

I am just about fucking done. 




 Maybe I should have put an 'Irony Warning' at the bottom of the post to clarify it for people such as yourself. 




 And if you aren't terrified already- here is everything they didn't (dare) teach you in school about this great country.

 They are doing what they can to make it illegal to be poor. At least to make their lives as much a living hell as possible.  




 And according to [Gary Webb](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-levin/gary-webb-was-right_b_6024530.html), and now accepted as fact, the CIA helped bring crack, heroin and cocaine into the US to sell to poor communities to finance the Iran Contra Affair. 

The results of this was [horrifying for south america and us](https://youtu.be/azYxPf_Ahp4). That song was written by Bruce after visiting SA during the wars being brought there from the US. Some surviving villagers told him of the villages people being locked into their church and it being set on fire- children and old people to burning alive. We brought utter hell down on those people - and it was Reagans boys who did it. 
 




 If God turns out to be a woman.. you are in deep trouble, boy. 




 Revelations was written by the Apostle John of a series of visions he had of the "end of days". 

There certainly weren't enough people on earth when it was written to have a huge environmental impact. That is why it fascinates me. Because now we do have enough people and are having a drastic impact. 

Strong's Concordance states the translation for 'earth' basically means: 4a) the earth as opposed to the heavens 

And the word 'destroy' (the earth): 

to rot thoroughly, to ruin (decay utterly, destroy, perish).

And the largest disaster NASA had was when they underestimated the effect of weather on an O-ring seal.

 I had no idea, until this moment, that my 'religion' had a name. 




 The average American woman miscarries at least 12 times over a normal lifetime. Most of the time they don't even know it has happened. 




 Or as I used to ask people who asked my opinion on legalization:

"Would you rather run into some Hells Angels high on pot or drunk on Jack Daniels?" 




 This pope has been different about the whole 'rich lifestyle' thing. He got rid of the papal throne - the gilded robes - drives his own old car and lives in a 2 room apartment instead of the luxurious papal residence. At that apartment, filled with priests and bishops, he eats at the cafeteria with everyone else. He also 'fired' a bishop in the states for spending a lot of money refinishing an upscale residence. 

Maybe you should read up on someone before just automatically blasting them. You might be surprised.

 Actually, it is related to one of Gods last acts toward man, according to Revelations:

 The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. 
 
 The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small-- 
 
 and for destroying those who destroyeth the earth."
 
 Rev. 11:18 




 The Tootsie Roll Indian is over 80 yrs old and in the Public Domain. Glad you aren't on my jury team. ffs. 




 I am not talking about the victims. I am talking about the News paper. I have 100% sympathy for the victims. 

I just think that the news organization was stupid for trying to turn this into some sort of spiritual event using this part of James 1 about two people who died horribly in a storm.  




 It's labeled 'Tootsie Roll Indian' and that Indian is in the public domain. It's over 80 years old ffs. 




 Actually no, she doesn't. She talks about purchasing good quality, high thread count t-shirts to use as a base for her designs on her website.  




 Whose work did she take credit for? 




 Maybe she should buy some sheep. loom the wool. make the shirt. grow some cotton etc etc.

Yes she hand screen prints the shirts. Exactly as advertised. 

ffs. You would think reddit absolutely hates everyone who even tries.  




 Who did she steal them from? Link to designs or designers? Anything? You are accusing someone in an open court of opinion here. Prove your accusation. 

And the Indian is over 80 years of age and is in the public domain- so that does not count.  




 It's only strong enough for her to support her children on out of her garage workshop. 

Not only do you not admire that- you are obviously an asshole on a circle jerk. Let's see some of your brilliant designs.  




 It's public domain. Once again Reddit hangs an already hurting person from the nearest tree. Nice.  




 She is. The Indian is a public domain image.  




 It's a public domain image. No harm no foul. Except for the knee jerks kicking her on reddit. Fucking classic though.  




 Someone thinks its cool looking - she is supporting her kids on the proceeds instead of being on welfare. 




 Your edit came a little too late - now hundreds of people are blowing this off because they think she 'stole' the indian design.  




 Context and intonation- which you weren't there for.  




  A lot of people also claim they've already seen that #MERICA design on other shirts from other businesses.

That reason?

oh ok.

Too bad that absolutely 0 claims of this were accompanied by links to images.
 




 yw 




 It isn't an American Flag with the word 'America' on it. 

It's a minimalist design of the bars with #MERICA in the space of the stars. And the design she made a year ago is copied exactly by Target- right down to the font type.

Here is a successful and similar lawsuit won by an original artist against American Eagle:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/29/aholsniffsglue-american-eagle-artist-lawsuit-copyright_n_5627862.html

 
 




 You can say the same for Marvel Comics Capt. America t-shirt designs with the American Flag. Does this mean she deserves to be ripped off and they don't? 

Oh- the American Flag has been used before - so we don't have to license your design. 

Or- I don't like the design- so it deserves to be ripped off and monetized by this multinational corporation.

Doesn't fly.  




 Show me where her exact design has been done and I will agree with you. So far I haven't seen it. A lot of companies use variations of the US flag- and all of their art is protected. Why shouldn't hers be? Because she isn't Marvel Comics or the NFL?  




 And neither does the 'artistry' of the design. Yet that argument is throughout this thread.  




 Then tell the licensees of Capt. America flag t-shirts that they no longer have to pay for that particular style. Captains, America, and Flags are everywhere- right?

 Her Etsy page and website has been linked in comments from this morning, they are also linked on the ABC News story- if you bothered to read it you would know this. Since you didn't bother to read it, how you could be so self-assured in attacking this person and her small business? 

Obviously I didn't ask for a selfie. 

I haven't seen any other shirt design like hers yet- outside of Target. 

18 years ago the use of the term 'merica' was unheard of as well as the use of a hashtag. 

So I am very doubtful of everything you posted previously. 

I am familiar with US design copyright law having known a person who did a design for fabric wall hanging sales- and found her design on an online poster sale site - a clear rip - just as what happened here.

 She did sue successfully. Hopefully this woman will be successful as well.  




 Obviously you didn't read the story or watch the ABC News video. 

http://abcnews.go.com/US/oregon-woman-accuses-target-graphic-shirt/story?id=30983944

Searched the hell out of Google. I can't find any other T's out there similar to her design except at Target. 




 Why don't I see a pic of your shirt that is 'exactly like this'? Hers has a hashtag on the front of the Merica- she has a whole line of these. [I didn't know Hashtags were popular 18 years ago.](http://www.sandilakeclothing.com/products/merica-adult?variant=1093863397)

 /u/14YearOldsAreHot has one link karma. 

I am seriously thinking that Target has done the same thing that other corporations have that have negatively hit the front page. Sent in a PR team to lead the conversation against the small business owner and manipulate the up/down votes.  




 There is copyright on the art. She could put this on a wall hanging and still be protected by US Law.

 Beyond the point that Target ripped off a small business design.

It depends - you want a shirt that lasts a few months or a few years?

If you read the article or watched the ABC news video you would see that her t-shirts are individually screen printed by hand using  high-end inks on t-shirts with a much higher thread count than Targets. In other words- her shirts will last much longer than Targets.  
 




 Wrong. She has been selling this design for over a year on Etsy - to help support her kids rather than going on welfare.  




 I bet they don't steal NFL logos. And why should the NFL have any more protection than any small business owner in America?

 Spent some time here researching on different image searches. She definitely didn't copy anyone elses design and has been selling that shirt for over a year. 

You work for Target, btw?

All these rather new subs attacking this woman is getting on my nerves.

 Then they aren't doing their basic homework as a corporation.  




 There are multiple sites out there that give the data what are best sellers on Etsy in different departments. Don't need to google it.  




 So reddit converges on this magazine- viciously attacking it on their twitter feed and Facebook feed over lack of attribution to the band- and it's a pr stunt by the band.

And then this same 'reddit community', a few days later, viciously attacks a woman whose art was actually ripped off and monetized by a major corporation?

I smell a big fat PR team rat.  




 We have a woman successfully supporting her children by creating designs (whether it's to your taste or not doesn't matter) and screen printing them, individually, by hand, in her garage. Then selling them on an online outlet. 

We have a multi-billion dollar, multinational corporation finding the design, probably using [one of the sites that lists the top selling items on Etsy](http://www.handmadeology.com/top-100-handmade-etsy-sellers-2014-by-number-of-sales/), copying it and profiting by selling it nationwide. 

What is your 'Case in point' that makes the small business owner wrong and subject to ridiculous attacks while reddit absolves the multinational corporation? I really want to see it. 

Obviously she is protected by law against this sort of thing. Or did Target send some PR teams in to lead this circle jerk attacking her, attacking Etsy and even attacking Etsy sellers? It won't be the first time a major corporation has manipulated reddit. 

Electronic copyright law says she is protected.

What the fuck? We had a band complaining last week about a web magazine that posted their music video without attribution and Reddit was up in arms about it.

Now we have a multinational corporate box store stealing this persons design and selling it nationwide, at a profit, and the 'top' posters on the Reddit story are excoriating and attacking:

a. The person who made the design, 

b. the design itself (as if personal sense of taste mattered to the story), 

c. her online sales outlet (as if that mattered),

d. and all of the other small business people who sell on this sales outlet.

What the heck ?

Are redditors now commonly, en-mass, protecting multinational corporations over the average, hard working person in American who is trying to develop their own business? 

Or are there a bunch of pro Corporate, anti-small business PR people sent to reddit to lead the conversation and up-down votes on stories that make the front page?

This rabid reaction makes absolutely no sense otherwise. 




 Oh jesus I thought it said 'Making a mini sword out of a snail."

 Testing of Your Faith

2 Count it all joy, my brothers,[b] when you meet trials of various kinds, 3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.

5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. 6 *But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.*

9 Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, 10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass[c] he will pass away. 11 *For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.*

12 Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him. 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, I am being tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. 14 *But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. 15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.*

https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1 version=ESV

16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.[d] 18 Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. 
























 I live in a rather bohemian city (very small) in the mountains. This was a new, small business- so I decided to go there in support. We do crazy liberal stuff like that. 

So the guy is talking about how he had a shop in L.A. but decided to move here because it was 'cooler' (literally- we are in the mountains). Then he started talking about local politics in a kind of denigrating manner (while enjoying a glass of the cleanest tap water in the US and breathing some of the cleanest air).

I just maintained a neutral face, to see how far he would go. He apparently took that for acquiescence and said something about how we needed to get rid of all those 'hippies' to "change the liberal politics 'round here". 

Despite the fact that those 'hippies' are the ones bringing in entertainment, creating businesses, painting cool murals, holding art events, fairs and farmers markets, promoting local growth and keeping out the big box stores- everything that brings people here in droves to drop a lot of money into the local economy.

And so I knew where he was going from there - and I was done.

 They used to call themselves 'Tea Baggers' until they found out what it meant.

 I had no idea Kansas had a liberal oasis. Kind of like Austin in Texas? I guess I wouldn't mind living in Kansas. 




 We still have the guild. It's one of the oldest ones in the game. Pretty retired though. A few old players pop in to say hey every once in a while. I am not going to close shop though till the game ends because we have a few members who passed away (accidents/cancer, etc) and I promised their families. 




 Could it be a foreigner with a new drivers license?
 




 This is exactly what we were asking for.  




 Hey. I have chicken thawing right now to make chicken and dumplings.  




 I was there. This vid gave me chills. He also showed up at Ironforge and that was a helluva fight at the gates.

Also remember flying on a taxi bird to Winterspring and saw below this giant flame dog farting and belching smoke and flame. I rode back to where I had seen it and all of a sudden there was this boss, Kruul, walking toward town. Called on guilds and we took him on, about 20 of us. Wiped us completely out. So we called on some more people and ended up in a 40man competition raid with the Horde to see who got him first. 

We wiped-
They wiped

Then we brought him down. 

edit- found a vid some group made https://youtu.be/knwZl7my-NY

25 years ago my Uncle Duane became our family genealogist. He had money from a pharmacology business and traveled to places in Europe and the Mormon library in Utah. He traced us back to Olaf the Tree Hewer. My mother and I were fascinated with this as we continually produce tall children with bright blue eyes. All of the men in my family line are well over 6ft. We also have this tendency toward rebellion. Sample of this at the bottom of the tree, below. Some of these links are spoilers as they contain the lore.

Present day sample: My great great Uncle [Harry 'Slim' Sallee](http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/f5ef8e5d). Pitcher for Reds, Cardinals and finally for the Giants during the 1917 World Series 'Black Sox' Scandal. [His picture.](http://i.imgur.com/nACpt.jpg)

Slim barely spent a calm, normal day of his life. Constantly in trouble from the day he was born:

When the routine of practice got too strenuous, Sallee would leave St. Louis' League Park and walk across the street to a social club known as the "Grass Eaters", housed only 100 feet away from the clubhouse. Sallee often "exercised his rights as a member" of this social club. One clubhouse boy said that during games Sallee would lower a bucket over the fence on a rope to a confederate who would fill it (with beer) at the social club.

The players were not allowed to drink, by contract. But Harry would tell stories of being hung out of hotel rooms by the other players, run to a bar and get liquor and come back to the hotel and climb up bedsheets to the room. 

 




 Not with over 40% of Americans now living on Minimum wage. I am sure they are eating anything they can afford; mostly high fat, high sugar crap.

Where are you from, Mars? 




 Chicken. 




 Sorry, it's proven that people in the US are getting fatter and fatter from eating poorer foods and trying to make up for vitamin/mineral deficiencies by eating more. Also the food choices for the poor are overloaded with fats and sugars to make cheap bulk.  




 Just wait.. they are going from fat shaming to poor shaming. Just as bad and as likely they will end up there the way things are going.

I don't know what has happened to reddit lately either- but the most shameful thing is the attitudes.

One note- Poverty is the living, breathing proof of failure of the political and corporate system in a country. To set people up to blame the poor is absolving the politicians and corporate heads of their failure. Don't do it. 




 I knew a woman from West Virginia who moved to a northern city. She married at 13 and had her first child in WV. She didn't know what birth control was or how to prevent pregnancies- knew nothing about it whatsoever- until her first visit to a northern city doctor with her third pregnancy a little over 3 years after the first birth.

This was in the early 1960's. 




 Uh huh. 




 Then they should lie to assholes like this about incipient testicular cancer to prevent them from breeding. 




 Here is another one. [This was hysterically funny.](http://i.imgur.com/eA2QeC0.jpg)

When they first made snowballs in the game the targeted toon would flip over onto it's back. Everyone loved them. 

Also, as I discovered when my friends and I went to have a snowball fight on the SW/IF Tram, snowballs travelled at exactly the same speed as the tram. So the result was that once everyone got off the tram they would be hit by every snowball thrown at them during the ride. 

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM - the target would be doing flips in the air, totally stun-locked.

So we would lurk around the station, wait till some poor, unsuspecting player got on, get on the last tram car and start pelting snowballs at them. I'm laughing right now thinking about it. 

Also we discovered that if you threw a snowball at a target at the moment they mounted a taxi bird, the snowballs would hit them as soon as they landed - anywhere. 

And blizzard stopped it.. such a bummer. 




 I have a very strong suspicion that all of these new people Activision hired are people who have never actually been able to afford to play the game. Maybe in India or another code sweatshop type operation.  




 You reminded me of [this.](http://i.imgur.com/WkD6yNt.jpg).

My second toon I made a few months after beta -she ended up being a 19 twink and had her little rogue partner (usually my daughter or hubby at the helm of that one.)

Best story I have is;

"Back in the day, mages had unlimited sheeps on the battleground. You also had set battlegroups and would regularly play against the same players.

One day this Troll was speed hacking (a method where they would dc quickly/repeatedly and lag the game for other players) and we caught him alone in a hut on WSG. So I repeat sheeped his ass in the hut while my rogue partner stunlocked and killed everything that tried to come rescue him. 

We laughed ourselves into hysterics. 

Next time we encountered him we did the same thing. From then on out - until they changed the battlegroup system, it was game-on between me and him in every bg we ended up in together.  




 Leveled 3 100's. The rest of my alts I have locked at 90. Not going there. Unsubbing before my next pay date. 




 That's because old school players are accustomed to getting things like Ulduar, Firelands, new zones, Emerald Dream Dragons and Blackrock in a patch. Not selfie cameras. 




 Maybe he is a blizz employee. 




 I am not referring to the 'floating dead' aspect. I am referring to the lack of education, regulation and poverty that let's this continue.

Corporate/Banking groups (mostly multinationals now) are spending millions lobbying for low wages, ending the EPA, ending pollution regulations, ending work safety regulations, destroying what is left of labor power, ending supplemental health care, etc.

This is all part of the "Make gub'ment smaller!" movement.

The result of this, if they are successful, is exactly what you see in India and Bangladesh. Very few ultra rich at the top, wholly unregulated (who never see these streets) and masses of people in poverty.

EDIT: If you have an alternate point to make, man up and debate this instead of dv it. 
 




 Believe it or not- poor people in America are shitting in the streets now. They just haven't been doing it long enough yet to do it in the open. 




 Uh huh? 

How about a debate?

 Everything you said, and:

Second, ungate professions. Put fixed gem slots back on gear. Give us our enchants back. I don't understand why reforging, meta gems, and most enchant slots were removed. I LIKED having to invest some time and resources into my character. These days, getting gear is boring as hell.

I will add; "Slow Down", and reserve Heirloom gear to a few slots, like trinkets, gloves and belts.

Leveling speed and ease is ridiculous. Now there is no reason to level professions, because why bother to slot a gem or enchant or make a piece of gear you or your customer will only use for a couple of hours? This also means none of the made items can sell on the AH. When leveling and moving through new areas/dungeons was challenging, these items were important. Now you never die.

So now there is no reason to revisit old raids and dungeons where rare patterns drop. Or travel to different areas to farm materials, gain various faction rep for some recipes and make special items. That's a huge chunk of the game that is just gone.

I have 10 yr old toons with enchanting, alchemy, leatherworking, who have rare and very cool old school recipes that are now worthless. There was no reason to take this away from players- and it is a slap in the face of those who have invested time and money. 




 A few stacks of dynamite and a bic.  




 Go through the old patches from back in the day. Every few months brought major new content: http://www.wowwiki.com/Patches/1.x

At bottom of the page you can click on 2.x, 3.x etc to see those patches.  




 10 yr player. I already feel burned.  




 The farm was cute- but anti-social and had nothing personalized about it. Fixing just those two things and anchoring it in SW or IF (for ally) would have been awesome. For personalization you could get plaques with achieves or pics of some of your fav screenshots on the walls.  




 They did not give us exactly what we wanted. What we requested was the option to have a 'place' that we could bring others into; up to and including our guild members. That's all. 

We didn't want mind numbing missions that virtual followers would go adventuring on. We wanted missions that our groups/guild would go adventuring on. We didn't want them to kill professions along the way, either. 




 Never did buy this. Wow is not a 'closed ended' game that you 'finish'. I remember we (me and my beta partners) deliberately took our time to level up- no rush. Why should there be? We wanted to explore - quest and see *everything* the game offered. 

This whole 'people too busy now to play long time' is a fallacy that has led blizz to believe everyone needs to be able to lvl to max in a week, when we took months.  




 Content content content. This is why wow was exciting:

 Flourishing? I am ready to start inventing recipes. Shrimp Chips, anyone? 

I am not sure. This is a non co2, planted tank that has an Eco Complete substrate (20b) layered with some natural sand / dirt from the river out back (Sierra glacial stream) + fluorite (20lb). 

ph 7. Other parameters good. Temp around 77-78. 10-15% water change once a week or so. I use a little flourish once a month + plant tabs at base of larger plants. 

I have several different kinds of mosses- normal java moss, subwassertang and some mini fissidens that I got to attach to the castle roof.

They eat whatever they can scavenge plus 3 algae tabs 2-3x a week. Wardley Pleco tabs- aspirin sized ones. 

The shrimp were a couple of baby hitchhikers that came in on a little bundle of plants. Took me a while to figure out where they came from.

Now I have a colony in my low tech 29 bowfront. Must have hitchhiked over when I was moving / trimming plants. 




 You are saying we torture animals because some people are egotistical, arrogant dumbasses.

Gotcha  




 The top line (8 degrees) is if we do nothing at all.

The other two values (2 and 4 degrees) are what we get with slowing and stopping carbon fuel burning combined with a massive, global geoengineering program to recapture CO2 using technology that hasn't been invented yet. 

None of these take methane release due to melt or any other feedback mechanism into account.

 Your post just gave me a flash remembrance of something I read decades ago. Just now looked it up and it is how I remembered it. 

 In Russia there comes the hope of the world, not as that sometimes termed of the communistic, or Bolshevik, no; but freedom, freedom! That each man will live for his fellow man! The principle has been born. It will take years for it to be crystallised, but out of Russia comes again the hope of the world. (1944) No. 3976-29
Edgar Cayce.

Now when he spoke this and even when I read it (in the 70's) Russia was the great evil on the earth.  




 I have noticed the ones that use that word the most are the ones who ultimately vote to keep the most unpatriotic things in place. With the GOP stacking congress/senate we are screwed. 




 This is the entire point to developing a fascist system. And it is exactly why they get entrenched and are hard to remove. 




 The whole 'bad women' and 'crazy feminists' stories started hitting about 6 months ago. Right about the time Hilary started hinting at a run for office. I believe it is deliberate astroturfing by GOP PR groups.  




 Zero growth rates are only a part of the equation. [Right now we are on track toward an 8 degree C warming.](https://youtu.be/8akSfOIsU2Y) That's a planet killer. Right now the 'survivable' 2 degree mark relies on development of a carbon sequestration technology that doesn't exist and isn't even being worked on by any scientific organization or country.  




 I think we should make them all use tin cans with string. 
And we can take their drivers licenses and cars away. And make them wear flour sacks with a yellow 'P' (for Peon) sewn on so we can tell them from the real citizens. Then once they are completely castigated from the rest of society we can put them in labor camps.  









 All mosses can help with the nitrate cycle. Marimo is just a lot of cleaning packed into a small ball.

Get a tiny heater, plenty of plants- a little java moss. In this one the heater is under the substrate. 




 One option is to get a couple of java/marimo moss balls to keep in the tank. http://www.fishlore.com/fishforum/aquarium-plants/103662-what-point-moss-ball.html

It will help your tank re-cycle and in the future help prevent another crash if you lose power again. 




 It is wonderful to see goldfish in a proper environment. These guys have suffered from so much disinformation over the years it's mind boggling.

 Thank you Kate. I was wondering about that this morning.  




 So weird how the second the word 'nuclear' is in a post there are suddenly more comments than usual - pretty rapidly too.

I have actually tested this on long dead threads and seen an influx of nuclear supportive type comments within minutes.

 Hi. The 'lacy' moss is plain Java moss tied on with cotton thread. By the time the cotton rots away the moss is imbedded on the driftwood. The little grassy plant is a micro sword. 

The floating plants are common duckweed (Lemnia Minor) and Miniature Water Lettuce (Pistea). The water lettuce has the longer roots. 

Red plant- as long as lighting and fert. requirements are met, Alternanthera Reineckii var. mini is nice. If it gets too big just trim it. I have the large type in the big tank. Another option is a mini Cryptocoryne. They tend to be more brown than red usually.

The thing with red plants is the proper fertilizer balance to maintain the color. 

Also- none of my tanks have Co2. I cover them during the day with fitted plexiglass and run a light bubbler at night.  




 Thank you! I started working at it when I was 12. Started a couple of other businesses some years ago but I will always be a hobby keeper. It is living art.

 Anubias are low light plants. Even though some lights look bright to the human eye, the key for plants is the correct spectrum. This is also a very deep tank, which is going to make a big difference on your lighting needs. 

Also Anubias don't need the correct strata for rooting. 

If you want a planted tank, a few suggestions.

Make sure you have the correct base for them to root in.

Research lighting and apply it (could be a bit expensive).

Research fertilizers and apply. (also slightly expensive).

Don't keep soft plant eating fish if you want plants such as anacharis. 

You can never add too many plants at once. Stock it up. 

10 hours of lighting will lead to an algae nightmare. No more than 5 hours of correct spectrum lighting a day. 

Otherwise you can stick with low light plants, such as anubias. Research low light plants if you plan on only having two tubes on the tank. 

Definitely change out your bulbs for a plant spectrum bulbs, regardless. 




 Here's the deal with 'hungry' fish. Since they have to hunt for food most of their waking hours (in the wild) just to stay alive, they do not have a 'shut off' switch in their brain telling them that they are 'full' -like humans do. They don't need one. 

Since you are artificially feeding them please ignore the begging if you know they are actually eating every day. Check bellies after dinner. Unfortunately, consistent food begging by fish has killed more than I like to think about.  




 Very pretty! Nice job. And bettas never hold still. Had to figure out high speed settings to take pics of my fish. 




 /u/msgreyson got it. One more thing with mystery deaths to check is cleaning products. Turn off filters before using heavily scented or odorous cleaning products, dust spray, bleach, ammonia, etc. Always make sure soap is rinsed off the hands before contact with tank water.  




 Do you have a water softener?

One thing you can do is add a very small piece of (dead and bleached) branching coral to the tank to add a bit more naturally dissolved calcium. About an inch per 10g. You can also add a level teaspoon of pure epsom salts per 20g. This can help with snails with thin shells as well. Just keep an eye on your ph. 




 Beautiful! Wonderful that you have given them a proper habitat.

I was working at Byerly's when these were first imported to the states. Back then only males in breeding mode would color that nicely.  




 Because people get mad when you fuck with their internal fantasy worlds? Ya thanks, was in the tropical/salt fish business for 30 yrs. 




 Bet you fed the guinea pig lettuce.  
























 It's a new defense called *The Firing Squad* defense. 

If you have 13 people shooting at someone - make sure the other 12 get off on lesser charges (or no charges) and throw the book at the 13th (to calm the mob). 

Then when the 13th person goes to trial the prosecutor can shrug and say 'We don't know beyond reasonable doubt if *this* guys bullet is the one that killed the victim".

So make sure if you ever go to commit murder to bring at least 12 friends along. Apparently in America it's a "Get out of Jail Free' card now, seeing as it is enshrined in precedence.  




 I stated:

 If you think that running from the police should automatically mean a public execution, on the spot, maybe you are in the wrong country.

 Never heard of 'roid rage'? Seriously. 

Of growing concern to physicians and psychologists is the mounting evidence that anabolic /androgenic steroids cause severe and sometimes permanent mental disorders. The addictive nature of steroids often leads users to administer progressively higher doses and more exotic combinations of the drugs to maintain and increase the initial muscle building effects.

***Abundant clinical and anecdotal evidence suggests that steroids often lead to unusually aggressive and irrational behavior.***

And using steroids isn't a problem for a guy who straps on a gun every day and goes out to deal with the public?

Just using a little common sense here.

 The really sickening thing about this case is this. I have relatives in medicine- one is a coroner. He has autopsied 2 'hero' police officers killed in the line of duty. Both of them had cocaine in their systems. One exhibited long term steroid use. 




 You forgot a 0.

By the narrowest measure possible  in which we give police every benefit of the cause of death doubt in incidents where they Tasered or restrained suspects  85 percent of the sampled incidents were the sort of police killings the government might be expected to keep track of. If we include other arrest-related deaths (and theyre included in Bureau of Justice figures), then 93 percent of incidents qualified as police killings.

Applying these percentages to the total count at Killed By Police would imply that officers acting in the line of duty have killed in the neighborhood of 1,250 to 1,350 people since May 1, 2013. Thats about 1,000 deaths per year.

 113?

 It is *exactly* like saying "it's ok". It sets court precedent that automatically justifies future shootings, chokings, beatings, etc by the police.  




 One thing that everyone seems to overlook here. Every single one of these cases in which a cop is found not guilty of killing a civilian stacks the deck on precedence in a court of law. 

If this keeps up, police will be able to show justification in any court of law for killing anyone for any reason- due to precedence of prior case law. 

And it won't matter what color you are. 




 I have one issue with the mannequin element. There were 5 shots to the womans head that was not on the mannequin for some reason. 




 officer reported that was not the case and at 10:47 p.m. radioed: Passenger just put his hands out asking us to stop. He does not have a gun. He has black gloves on, the officer said, according to the transcript.

Theres a red pop can in his hand.

 It was a plainclothes cop in an unmarked vehicle attempting to pull them over for not using a turn signal. That's what started them running. 

If some stranger in street clothes tried to get you to pull over, would you?

 Pine nuts are the little seeds between the 'shells' on the pine cone. Take a fully dried but fresh pine cone (like just off the tree for a week or two) and hit it hard on something- they fly out. Pine nuts sell for about 12-15 bucks a lb around here.

Washoe   Paiute Indians [make pastes and flour out of it](http://travelnevada.com/sites/default/files/styles/rotator_detail/public/field/image/PineNuts_Paiute.jpg?itok=py4U05Og) and you can eat them raw like regular nuts. Delicious and very good for you. 




 On a related note, my kitten can't hunt.

Obviously he CAN CATCH TREE BABIES. Of course he can hunt. 




 You see about the end of the Harry Potter segment the other band just leave like fuck this y'all can have it.

 This is why old people look like hell. All the hugs. 




 Obviously the point of the matter isn't the deed, but the *justice* or *injustice* of the deed combined with viewers personal immersion with the character.

You are trying to shift the point of the matter to fit some pre-defined political stance.

People *did* go out of their minds at the Red Wedding - because of perceived injustice toward innocent people. 

People *didn't* go out of their minds with the golden crown scene, because the brother was a violent, stupid dick who sold his little sister to barbarians.

People *did* go out of their minds when Ned was beheaded, because it was unjust. 

People *didn't* go out of their minds when Ramsey (justly, give or take) tortured Theon, because Theon killed or had killed hundreds of innocent people who were nearly family, including 2 little boys.

Sansa? It wouldn't matter if she were raped or had her hand cut off or was flayed or poked in the eye with a pin. 

It wasn't the *details* of the act that mattered. It was the *unjust* violence against this wholly innocent girl who has been with viewers since the beginning- and who has already been through total hell. 

Capiche? 




 Of course we didn't. Point being that nature has managed to generate an exquisitely balanced series of symbiotic relationships within biological and geographical systems that functioned pretty damn well before humans came along. And will continue to do so long after we are gone- if we don't succeed in utterly wiping it out.

To imagine that nature 'needs' us to keep things straightened out is the height of arrogance. 




 Santa Barbara did a study on coyotes killed because they had become urbanized  - autopsies to check their dietary habits. Out of 200 coyotes they found that 80% of their diet was rodents. Rats, wild rabbits, mice and shrews. The rest was mainly garbage. No cats. No dogs. 




  Coyotes only expanded to most of the United States relatively recently, and as a result of us killing off wolves. 

You just made my point. You kill off an apex predator- another will come along and fill its place. "Nature balancing itself out." And the prey animals, rodents to deer, will overpopulate until that occurs. 
 




 Ok I'll make this clearer.

Bob kills 100 people, including 2 little kids. He gets the death penalty. 

Everyone shrugs.

An innocent, 15 year old girl does nothing wrong. She gets the death penalty.

Everyone raises hell.

Obviously the point of the matter isn't the *death penalty*, but the *injustice*.

 Sansa is a naive child who has been pretty much harmless her whole life. She lost her entire family in horrible ways and has been used as a pawn for 3 years.

The man Ramsey mutilated and tortured killed most of the people of Winterfell, men, women and children that he grew up with, including his teacher and weapons master - then had two innocent children killed and bodies burned to hang on the wall - in front of people who loved them (they didn't know they were farmers boys)

So of course peoples sympathies are with Sansa. Peoples sympathies are always with the innocent. Has nothing to do with sex.

 If Nature doesn't always balance itself out- what the hell happened before these oh-so-wise humans showed up?
 




 That's an important point. People got to know each other. You couldn't server hop, no blended servers. To ninja or act like an asshole back in the old days would get you shunned. 




 I lived in a hay growing area in NV. One year the good ole boys had a 3 day coyote hunt. For 3 years afterwards they lost tons of hay to Jackrabbits.

Coyotes are native to every state in the US. Best to leave shit the hell alone. It will balance itself out. That's what nature does.  




 I saw what someone else posted to the wow forum and it was right on. http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17346427864

 I would flawlessly recreate the Vanilla servers. The only elements of new content I would add is reforging and transmogging. Besides these, this game would follow the original game, right through WotLK. No LFR or LFD. No player/server phasing. Recreating the sense of community is a goal here.
 
 Other content that was hinted at, but not followed through with, would be added; like the Emerald Dream. This would extend the time frame of events and add new content within the old framework. 
 
 It would be available to all players for a one time fee of $10, same for returning players. And I can guarantee there will be returning players, millions of them. So many would come just to see the Emerald Dream fulfilled.
 
 Upon log-in players would have the normal choices of servers and characters- but with an added choice upon making a new character- in Vanilla. This would be the fork in the road that players who paid the $10 fee could choose.
 
 This would not eliminate the new game, it would still be available for ez mode players. 

This would make me so goddam happy. 




 I saw this yesterday and posted it to reddit.  I would immediately drop $10 make a new toon on this and never look back.

 Blackrock chain running- actually sparked my fear of heights. I would hold my breath all the way.

I just realized how badly lfr/lfg impacts immersion.  




 These weren't created when we started. It was full on guild run to the dungeon. Damn those were fun times- killing shit along the way. 




 I noticed [this chart of subscriber stats](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/) just yesterday and noticed that the downward turn started in '10. Right about the time lfr/lfg started.
I wondered about a connection, seeing as lfr lfg had such a huge impact on player experience. 




 I loved ST. Hate what they did to it.  




 Traveling to get to the dungeon was the first half of the adventure.  




 But they were pretty much color coded shortly after release. 




 Is there such a thing as power leveling any more? You can sleepwalk through it and it happens so fast you barely see half of the world.

Not in Europe.

 Funny story about LBJ.

A very good friend of my mothers was the (young, pretty) widow of a gentlemen who had been in French politics. She and her dead husbands brother were invited to a dinner party at a major hotel after a diplomatic meeting in France and LBJ and his retinue was there. Things got drunkenly boisterous and flirtatious as the evening went on and she eventually retired to her suite.

An hour later she answered a knock at her door and there stood LBJ, in a silk bathrobe with a bottle of champagne, a bouquet of flowers and a huge cigar- with two secret service men flanking him.

He said "Madame, your President has come to pay you a call."

And she let him in.

When he left in the wee hours the secret service men were still standing there outside of the room.

She said he "was not pretty, but he was very persuasive". 




 Early 40's through late 70's. They raised 4 children. They bought one home and then they had a large home built in the mid '50s on 10 acres. They took two week (or longer) vacations every year. They could have been the poster children for "The American Dream"

It had a strong union. I remember my grandfather going out the door to a strike with a lead-filled baseball bat. And he was white collar system designer.

My grandfather had briefly played for the Pittsburgh Steelers (back injury) and my grandmother was a Rosie the Riveter who got her degree between having babies.

They retired before NAFTA - after which the plant moved manufacturing overseas. 




 "**The question is whether it would make them fear for their safety, or the safety of those around them..**

[A criminal threat,](http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/criminal-threats.htm) sometimes known as the terrorist threat, malicious harassment, or by other terms, occurs when someone threatens to kill or physically harm someone else.
 




 
Sure people need electricians, etc. But who is going to design the systems in the first place? 




 The only reason we won WW2 was because of our massive and innovative manufacturing base. We needed a large number of educated people to design, innovate and create for those manufacturers. 

Now we cannot even make umbrellas. 

WW3 is not going to be won by ranks of baristas and we cannot maintain superpower status with herds of burger flippers.

The US produced large quantities of military equipment into late 1945, including nuclear weapons, and became one of the strongest, most technically advanced military forces in the world. In addition to out-producing the Axis, the Allies produced technological innovations including radar (instrumental in winning the Battle of Britain), sonar (improving their ability to sink U-boats), the atomic bomb (eliminated the need to invade Japan) and the proximity fuze. Five times as effective as contact or timed fuzes, the latter was devastating in naval use against Japanese aircraft and so effective against German ground troops that General George S. Patton said it "won the Battle of the Bulge for us."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_production_during_World_War_II 




 My grandparents worked for a major appliance manufacturer here in the states. They both had degrees and would not have had their positions without them. 

It's not that we have too many people with college degrees, we no longer have an innovative, massive manufacturing base to support them. This is what needs to change. 




 I know someone who works for them- this melt is exactly what they have been waiting and planning for so they can move in to drill.

 How about the best Pranks Blizzard ever played?
 
Corrupted Blood Plague (actually a glitch- but funnier than hell, regardless). https://youtu.be/RxDvxKeLWlA 
We would actually go fight Hakkar just to port hunters back to main cities to spread this. 

DK Plague:
https://youtu.be/7DUzJklzJ0Y?t=13s

And the Zombie Plague (actually part of the scourge invasion):
https://youtu.be/zdT3Tert6DQ 




 Under a 14 yr old boys bed. 




 One of the main ones was kiting dragons and mini bosses to main cities. 

Blizzard ended up tethering them. But the fun and excitement of doing it- or other people doing it and the spontaneous mini raids that would form to kill it were part of the excitement of 'whats going to happen today?' when you logged on. 

The last one I was able to kite was Shan Bu to the Emperors Step. Someone forgot to tether him or they thought it couldn't be done. He stayed there through the weekend until re-set. 

Album: http://imgur.com/a/4vqEV

The other prank, also removed, was snowballs. 

[This was hysterically funny.](http://i.imgur.com/eA2QeC0.jpg)

When they first made snowballs in the game the victim would flip over onto it's back. Everyone loved them. 

Also, as I discovered when my friends and I went to have a snowball fight on the SW/IF Tram, snowballs travelled at exactly the same speed as the tram. So the result was that once they got off the tram they would be hit by every snowball thrown at them during the ride. 

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM - the target would be doing flips in the air, totally stun-locked.

So we would lurk around the station, wait till some poor, unsuspecting player got on, get on the last tram car and start pelting snowballs at them. I'm laughing right now thinking about it. They would fly through the air- same speed as the tram - and all catch up once the victim got off the tram.

Also we discovered that if you threw a snowball at a target at the *moment* they mounted a taxi bird, the snowballs would hit them as soon as they landed - anywhere. Took exquisite timing. Best was when you and a friend were going to taxi somewhere- let them mount while you pelt them. The cursing in pm when they landed .. freaking hilarious. 

And blizzard stopped it.. such a bummer. 




 Holy shit you don't know what you are talking about.

'talking about'? I am looking at a graph that is basically in a constant state of plummet, besides a few bumps, since end of WotLK. 




 Interesting, LFR and LFD were rolled out between 2009 (lfd) and 2011 (lfr) - about the time that blizz had 11-12 million subscribers. 

By Q2, 2012 they had dropped to 9 million subscribers. So that's pretty damn interesting. The only times it has come up above that number is briefly during expac releases before going down again.

Hell, maybe it did kill the game.
 




 So basically it is losing a million subscribers a month. Unless they do something drastically imaginative, the game is dead by fall. 




  the biggest rise of subscribers ever?

Do you have a link for this? I don't know of any 'rise'.  If it were different, you would not have stated this:

normal servers are already struggling.

I know of a lot of players who came back, hopeful, then left again.

Here's the numbers: https://youtu.be/8dOsT8x6iy8
 




 From your post of 6 days ago:

Yeah, but Lich King dropped a weapon for every spec and class. Therefore, all players had access to slightly higher item level weapons and no specific classes were left out. Same with Spine/Madness in Dragon Soul - between the two bosses, all classes had access to a weapon/trinket of the same ilevel to their peers. 




 Normal servers are struggling to maintain a player base after losing millions of players due to WoD. This could refresh that player base. 

If you didn't like Vanilla, that's fine. You don't need to play it. A lot of people did and still do love it. I know a lot of old school players- all but two of us are on WotLK servers. As one of them put it "If Blizzard won't do it, someone will (and has)."

ps How did you get from Vanilla to WoD unless you played it through? If so- it obviously wasn't 'bad'. If you never played it- how would you know? 




 Thank god people blinded by nostalgia can't decide what Blizzard does or doesnt do.

If you enjoy WoD, how would this impact your game? 

I think the post is brilliant. It takes nothing away from the current game, while giving a lot of people what they want. You have a personal problem with that?

I have watched players unsub for months now and know more old player friends who are now on WotLK rogue servers than in the official game.  









 I like how you put that; 'chupacabra'. 

It was while studying the Jarrell that I first discovered Gravity Waves in relation to amping up storms. I have a fascination with resonant waves and effects so it is very interesting.

I had heard of Jarrell, but had not really studied it until during the 2011 outbreak one of the tornados took a 'backward' track and I went into research mode. I cannot recall which tornado that was now. 

Thank you for your info. I did not know the other tornados you mentioned were also linked to gravity waves. 




 Except for the Republican crabs, who all sit around and chant 'DOWN WITH SOCIALISM!' as they slowly strangulate. 




 Unbelievable that we have gotten to the point of nearly killing off our prime pollinator. Sometimes I feel like I have stepped into a different dimension. A bad one.  




 In Ohio my mother was married to a top end blacksmith. He did ortho horse shoeing with a veterinarian. He had an aussie named Sassy and Sassy would sit on a stool in front of the horses, literally calming them to the point that they looked hypnotized. 

 This was good because he would have to work on them for longer than standard shoeing would take. 

Very smart dogs. 




 ..potential to be really, really bad had there been any sort of population center in the way.

Like Philadelphia, MS.

I am very sorry to hear about your illness. I hope you get through it quickly and come out the other side better than ever. When you are feeling up to finishing your posts, I'll be here if you want to chat. Meanwhile, lovely to meet you and welcome to StormComing :) Message me any time. 




 Thank you for this information. I will look into this event, it seems extraordinary. 

I have had a serious love/hate relationship with tornados since 1974. I was 14 and lived just outside of Xenia. 

I had just asked on /r/stormchaser if you were *the* stormstalker of the blog. I am so glad you are. I am a big fan of your blog. It's extremely well written. If you ever have any questions about Xenia,  I'm available. I remember it very well and possibly remember a few things that haven't been written about. Like the 're-planted tree' in a neighbors field.  




 Are you StormStalker from https://stormstalker.wordpress.com? 




 Possibly more like the Mussolini style of Fascism. Where certain corporations ruled the government- and quietly kept competitors subdued.

 What is it called when corporations have to get permission from the government to sell something? Let's see.. it's not capitalist.. must be a word for it.

 Besides, Japan hates those fascist bastards. 




 schooling
skooliNG/
noun
education or training received, especially at school.
"his parents paid for his schooling"
synonyms: education, teaching, tuition, instruction, tutoring, tutelage; 

In the late 18th century, Thomas Paine was amongst the earliest proponents of universal, free public education, which was considered to be a radical idea at the time.

Apparently, for some who want us to go back to those days of uneducated masses and slavery, it's still a radical idea.  




 Of course you know that a tornado can double back when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core. In this case I believe it had to do with the massive gravity wave to the south east -that generated a strong pocket of localized shear as well. 

If I seem wrong on any of this, please correct me. I am always learning. 




 That's another option- trees or bushes ripped out of the ground, leaving holes. Pretty brilliant actually.  




 Report to whom? The priest was a priest for a corrupt police dept.  




 Yes, I suppose we don't need all of this silly edumacation, seeing as it has done nothing for U.S. advancement in the world. Yep. Education, business development, scientific research leading to technology breakthroughs, maintaining a lead on other countries, etc. is all just something we should be cutting costs on.
 




 Did you ever go up into Jarrell? 




 Have you seen the video of the Philadelphia MS ground scouring? 

https://youtu.be/AcIqU6w-_04 

This was thought to be created by sub vortices within the main. 

I will revisit a map and images to see the orientation. 




  They deserve the "college experience" right?

Actually our country deserves to have the brightest kids with the best education moving out into business creation and the workforce. Our former high levels of affordable education is what grew this country in the first place. As it fails- so does the country.

 




 Yes, apparently it was at 2mph when it hit Double Creek. I was thinking that possibly those divots were from surface removal - apparently they also had to remove top layers for recovery purposes in some areas. The clearly circular patterns, though, seem odd for this.

Also, the [gravity wave effect study](http://homepages.vvm.com/%7Ecurtis/Jarrell/Jarrell.htm) is fascinating in regards to 'backward motion' and the low shear, high CAPE of that day. I had just posted a story on /r/StormComing on this http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/36azjw/the_incredible_jarrell_tx_tornado_probably_one_of/

  




 That's a possibility. I am going to scan more aerial tornado damage images to see if I can find anything similar.  




  no one (read: employers) in America will recognize your school.

And why would anyone want to go back to work in America?

Germany: The law requires a minimum of 20 paid days of vacation annually, but some companies give much more than that, sometimes as much as 30 paid days.

Paid sick leave is six weeks, during which you will continue to receive your full salary. After that time, health insurance pays 70% of your last salary until you either return to work or have to retire because of your health.

Mothers are allowed six weeks leave at full pay prior to the childs birth and eight weeks at full pay afterward. The mother or father is then allowed up to three years of unpaid leave to stay at home with the child.  




 We adopted 2 young sister cats - both preggers. They gave birth within 6 hours of each other. We had set up a long clothes closet for them to do this and have privacy- one cat at each end. Within a day one of the cats had moved to the other end with the sister and sisters kittens. 11 total. Thereafter it was just one big nursing cat/kitten pile. I don't even think they knew whose was whose after a while. 




 Thanks. I was thinking the same- about the spacing and regularity. They just look very odd. 




 I know 4 'top tier' Americans currently studying abroad, and one more getting ready to go to Germany.. Americans studying abroad has become, once more, the thing. Mostly because of the high cost of native universities.

And once there - a lot of them decide they want to stay. One of my friends ended up with the Berlin Orchestra and married. Another is currently at Oxford, teaching.

Do you happen to have statistics of what you claimed? Europeans coming to American Universities in droves? And students from third world countries do not count. They are escaping a bad situation as much as anything. 




 I have noticed in several ground 'after' pictures of the Jarrell TX May 27 - 1997 there are these odd round circles on the ground. I am familiar with cycloidal arcing, drag marks, etc. but don't recall seeing these before in tornado damage images until Jarrell. 

https://extremeplanet.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/jt-dc-1.png

Is it possible, since Jarrell was a multi-vortex, that these are touchdown 'suction' marks from small vortices within the larger body? They seem very tightly clustered. I just can't figure out what else they could be. 




 Ok if american tax payers are so fucking tight fisted- the smart kids will go to other countries and they will benefit.

 The class capable of chipping in is a ten ton elephant at this point - and since it is the 'job creating' class it will benefit the most.  




 You know what? Fuck Chase Bank   Wells Fargo, fuck the brain drain they have created, fuck high college tuition rates. 

"...the German government fully funds the education of its citizens -- and even of foreigners."

"..Finland charges no tuition fees, and it offers a large number of university programs in English.

"French University programs charge only a small tuition fee of about 200 dollars for most programs (covers everything but off campus living situations).

"Norwegian universities do not charge tuition fees for international students. 

So fuck the banks and any kind of possible excuse you can come up with for them.  




 College finance loans were originally designed to be non-crippling- at 1-2% interest when I was in college.  




 Thank god maybe we can start catching up with the rest of the civilized world. 




 The Jarrell Tornado has also been called the Dead Man Walking tornado from [this image.](http://lssn.us/image/JARREL~1.png)

By the time it passed through Jarrell, Tx. it had cleanly removed yards of asphalt from the road. Fragments of human victims were mixed with bits of formerly living livestock. Human chains of recovery personnel slowly moved across the landscape, combing through mud and debris for every trace of remains that could be retrieved for identification and burial.

The Jarrell tornado had another unique identifier, [it actually reversed course at one time- moving 'backward'.](http://homepages.vvm.com/~curtis/Jarrell/Jarrell.htm) 

In my years of experience in studying storms the Jarrell tornado is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, of tornados spawned in the United States.

 That's a very crafty bird right there. 




 Don't get too relieved. We had laying hens and I had a few that I raised from the egg. When I would come out and sit on the porch they would come running up and compete for lap room, just like small dogs. One would lay her head up on my chest for a cuddle. No food involved. Just feathery cuddles and low cooing noises. 




 Did that with my Warcraft account 10 yrs ago. 

So this year they sent an ugly Orc statue to some poor asshole at a pizza place in downtown Detroit.

  This time, though, Maskell didn't bring Wehner home. He navigated his car past the Catholic hospital and industrial buildings that surrounded Keoughs campus and drove toward the outskirts of the city. Eventually, he stopped at a garbage dump, far from any homes or businesses. Maskell stepped out of the car, and the blonde, freckled teenager followed him across a vast expanse of dirt toward a dark green dumpster.
 
 It was then that she saw the body crumpled on the ground.

 Socialism as in collective buying in order to streamline, save money and improve efficiency. Unlike the American Consumer model where everyone is expected to buy their own 'thing'.

Wealthy people and corporations practice this type of socialism on a daily basis. If you ever spent time in a wealthy neighborhood you will soon see that none of them own a lawnmower. They all use mower services. And most corporations have a fleet of cars that are used by mid-level management on up. 

It's only the lower classes who are discouraged from this by accusations of 'socialism'.  




 Another part that they missed- the part after they are 'raptured'.

The Apostles ask Jesus where they will all go and he answers:

 Where, Lord?" they asked Him. He said to them, "Where the corpse is, there also the vultures will be gathered." 

Luke 17:37 




 We should have left Saddam and his wood chipper the hell alone. 









 Thing is, Saddam was a Secularist and a lot of the folks that were in his 'torture prisons' were hard core islamists who wanted Iraq to toe the line with the rest of the Islamic fundamentalist nations. Some of the IS that were captured had spent time there. 




 in 25-50 years, they'll just say "Who could have known? The science wasn't in."

 If you think about it- if the GOP got every single wish fulfilled - the US would resemble Bangladesh in a few years. 




 The U.S. Military is one of the most 'socialist' organizations on earth. No one seems to notice that part though. 




 Somehow they missed the last chapters:

The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. **The time has come** for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small-- and **for destroying those who destroy the earth."**

Rev. 11:18

 Hey! I was right in the framing of that statement. You had me second guessing myself for a minute there. 

[Prey Animals](http://digital-desert.com/wildlife/prey.html)

The term prey refers to an animal that is sought, captured, and eaten by a predator. A predator is an animal that hunts and kills other animals for food in an act called predation. Smaller predators, such as mice and lizards can be, and often are, prey for larger predators. 




 High school debate?

Give it up dude. Basic statistics already wrap all the things you tried to state into a big bullshit burrito and flush it into a cesspool of hyperbole.

  I was wondering what was so NSFW about a tornado. Brazil just had one last week. 




 There are.. in Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands, UK etc.

Just not in the [U.S.](http://consumer.healthday.com/senior-citizen-information-31/senior-citizen-news-778/u-s-seniors-health-poorest-global-survey-shows-693917.html?lexp=true utm_expid=38353063-4.pIV1hUrQR8K_MJ1_OqjLag.1 utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) 

 




 I got hooked on trains when I had to go to Chicago from San Fran. I had the time and something about it just seemed appealing. I figured if I didn't like it I would get off in a major city and hop a plane. 

I got a cute little sleeper (came with three great meals a day) and I loved every second of it. It was like a mini vacation and was almost the same price as flying. That decided me. 




 I had a friend who lived near a private area used as a shooting/training range for the Michigan Militia.

If they started shooting before 6 am he used to aim his speakers out the upstairs window and blast the Barney Song. 




 I live in a resort area and have to go to san fran regularly. I used to drive it- utter nightmare. Now I take a nice bus to the train, have breakfast on the train, catch up on emails, Skype, prep for meetings. Get off refreshed and ready to go. It's wonderful; and cheaper than supporting a car. 




  Mussolini, who is credited with creating fascism, often said that fascist governments should be "corporatist" regimes, essentially ones that were run entirely by companies and the elites of society.

Fred Koch, father of the Koch Bros helped Mussolini develop this style of Fascism. Then came back to the US to spread it here via the John Birch Society and, apparently, his sons.  




 My idea of [glorious miles](http://www.iamtonyang.com/1208/concord_coach_bus_interior.jpg).

Got rid of my last car a few years ago and have saved around 6k a year ever since. Haven't regretted one moment.  









 This is not good.

 According to Ibach, the farm has been quarantined and the birds on the property will be killed. NDA will work with Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality to ensure proper disposal of dead birds. The likely method is burial at the site of the infection.
 
 In addition, facilities within about 6 miles will be quarantined and those within about 12 miles monitored. 





























 The National Weather Service says a 9-inch rainfall over a three-hour period may happen only once every 500 years; meteorologist Melissa Huffman said Clear Lake received 11 inches over three hours Tuesday evening. 
























 [Overflow from Tahoe into the Truckee river.](http://www.truckeeriverkeepers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Truckee-Tahoe-boca-900x600.jpg) Normally it is up around those tree banks.

Probably want to get out there soon. The two tributary rivers behind my house that feed Tahoe should be about 4ft deep right now. They are about a foot deep at most. That much because we got some rain this month.

edit: site with more info http://www.truckeeriverkeepers.com 




 They must have gotten permission to dredge. Last I heard the coast guard grounded her due to shallow water after she was stuck on the sand bar. I am glad you had a good time. 




 Bit more than that:

 East coasters [need to see this](https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU)- the reason behind these stuck weather patterns. 




 Tahoe is so low it is no longer feeding the Truckee river and snowpack was officially 0 this year. They have had to dry dock the tourist boats because the water level is too low to get to dock. 

The water is really algae-murky too near the shoreline. It's a complete mess. 




 The overflow from Lake Tahoe into the Truckee river- which feeds tributaries to this- hasn't been flowing for a year and a half - Tahoes water level is too low. Add 0 (zero) snowpack this season and Nevada is cooked.

Such a shame - this area of the sierra foothills was so beautiful. I wonder how the tribes are handling it. 




 You never explored the unfinished map of the Emerald Dream. It's amazing. And no - not all green. Giant plants and flowers though. 




 If I were a teacher forced to teach creationism I would include major creationism stories from around the world, including the Aztec, Navajo, Babylonian, Sumerian, Dogon, Chinese   Indian creationism stories, with an emphasis on similarities.

 Some people are just too mean to die. 




 What I meant was that fennel and kohlrabi have an allelochemical defense mechanism against peppers and they don't do well when grown near each other. 




 That ain't Jesus calling him...and why he's afraid to die. 




 Yes I have noticed for the past two summers there is a preponderance of it in those states. 




 What are they planted near? Don't plant peppers near fennel or kohlrabi.

I  would dig a little natural compost in around, make sure they have good drainage and just give them some time. You might want to try a little epsom salts (half teaspoon per gallon of warm water) and water them once a week for a couple weeks with that. 

Be careful with nitrogenous fertilizers though. If you over fertilize peppers with nitrogen they will get lush leaves and no fruit. You might want to try a dry vegetable mix fertilizer at half recommended dosage. Make sure to get a fertilizer with usable iron and sulfur. 




 I live near the mountains now and we have wild ones. But I did grow hybrids in my rock garden (in the midwest) with alstroemeria, dog-tooth violets, lady slipper, yellow and purple dwarf siberian irises, johnny jump ups around the base of them -and purple and yellow columbine.

I loved that garden. 




 Spinach always grew like crazy in my raised bed. (I let my chickens bed on it for half the winter and tossed wood ash from winters fireplace in it) I learned to toss it into darn near everything. Scrambled eggs? Go grab a couple double handfuls to toss in. Fried Rice? Same. And every single slow cooker meal. It especially goes well with pork dishes. 




 I had some morning glories come in through my kitchen window from a trellis of it in my annual bed. I loved the sunlight shining through the petals in the morning. 




 Bright Angel Point? 






















































 And this shits safe to drink, huh? Unless you are a plant.  









 And just try posting anything that could possibly be perceived as even 7th generation criticism of Warcraft or Blizzard on /r/wow. It's blatantly obvious that it is corporate controlled at this point. I was shocked at some of the very mild statements that I and others have made lately that were dv to death. 

It's not a circle-jerk as much as a dick sucking contest.

Edit: Ok I had my coffee. Got it.  




 I started noticing an anti-female 'anti-feminist' astroturfing campaign about 8 months ago. I'm in marketing. 

So about 2 months ago an old colleague contacted me about references. I asked him what he had been doing and he said he had been doing PR postings for the Republican party under a media group contract. I asked him why he left and he said it was because it had been turned into a *'Woman hatred, feminist hatred, made up stories fest 24/7"* in "prepping" for a Hillary run. He said they were even posting as rabid, crazy people claiming to be 'feminists' to make them look bad.

He quit when met someone and fell in love, and realized that he was posting, ultimately, about her, and his mother, and his sisters. 

A lot of people fall for slick 'advertising' - even redditors. Usually a clue is when all of a sudden you notice a clear trend popping up.  




 All of the achieves in Draenor includes:

Mythic Draenor Raider

Complete the Mythic raiding achievements listed below.
Mythic: Gruul Mythic: Oregorger Mythic: Hans'gar and Franzok Mythic: Beastlord Darmac Mythic: Flamebender Ka'graz Mythic: Operator Thogar Mythic: Blast Furnace Mythic: Kromog Mythic: Iron Maidens Mythic: Blackhand's Crucible Mythic: Kargath Bladefist Mythic: The Butcher Mythic: Tectus Mythic: Brackenspore Mythic: Twin Ogron Mythic: Ko'ragh Mythic: Imperator's Fall 




 Me too. I guess I will go sign up again. Still not thrilled with the garrison thing- but it at least shows someone was listening. Or maybe the numbers were beating them over the head. 




 Economic, social and technological.

Warning: long.

People pretty much stayed in the same places. My great grandmothers home was built by her father in 1920. She lived there until a few weeks before she died in 1983- when my grandmother cared for her in the house *they* bought in 1958. 

There were long term familial and neighborly support structures in place. People knew each other, and helped each other. The routine in the evenings was to go sit on the porch after supper and people who were out walking would stop and visit, and tell stories and talk politics or whatever. If you had a big porch like my great gran you had a few pitchers of cold tea ready. Same people, same faces, going back to the depression/war era.

Part of the reason for porch sitting or taking walks was to see people, part of the reason was AC wasn't common back then and it was nice to cool off in the evenings outside.

The generation of people older than me by 8-10 years; when they graduated college and got jobs, companies started moving people across the country. That was the beginning of the breakdown of the support system.

When I graduated HS I worked at a local pet shop for a few months, then got my own place. A very nice little rental that was comfortably paid for with one weeks check. There were no 'credit checks' back then- it was inconceivable that you could not afford a place to live with even the humblest of jobs. I was able to go to college part time and save back for the downpayment on my first house.

In the 2000's, when an artificial economy was built on the housing 'market' - driven by higher and higher property values (how are you going to *grow* an economy on stable values?) suddenly people couldn't afford to purchase homes, hell they could barely afford rent.

This also means that people move around a lot. More social breakdown, combined with technology that keeps people entertained in their artificial environments. And people having to work more than one job at a time that leaves little room for socializing with neighbors struggling to do the same.

 And here we are today. 

When I see pictures or google maps pics of European cities in which there are a lot of folks out and about, socializing, I know they are doing well. It's a thumbstick measure I have internalized. 




 My guild killed a lot of bosses over time. A lot of those moments were memorable. [We were always doing stupid, fun, wild stuff, from vanilla right through MOP.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/11499710@N00/)

But about epics, I'll put it like this: 

What if you were Indiana Jones and went on an adventure, endured some grueling moments, challenged fate, monsters, your skills and the elements and finally emerged victorious with a glorious, magical ring.

So you go back to town ... and half the people are walking around with the same ring, having barely done a thing to achieve it.

First off, there is definitely not the same sense of achievement and pleasure for the people who didn't leave town or even break a sweat to get the ring. The excitement and joy would be diminished. Ho hum, just another bit of gear.

Secondly, Indy would just be like.. fuuck. 




 I didn't unsub because of the hunter issue. My unsub was in protest of this xpac. I have 3 100's. One at 675 so it is not like I didn't give it a good shot. 

We paid 20% more and waited 14+ months for an expansion that removed more playable / fun content from the game than it has added:

1. Flying

2. Reforging + Item Upgrades

3. Scenarios

4. Character Abilities

5. Valor/Justice Points

6. Daily quest hubs

7. 10 Heroic ('Mythic') Raiding

8. Guild levelling/perks

9. Repeatable rare mobs

10. Gathering professions for over half a year and counting

11. All old school unique professions scrapped in all future 'content'.

12. Decent ilvl gear from world bosses (650?)

13. Previous expansions' content scrapped: MoP legendary questline, Garrosh heirlooms, Isle of Thunder solo scenarios, MoP challenge mode content, old raid item drop nerfs

14. "Promised"/Delayed content:

Farahlon

Karabor/BladespireIron Docks quest hub

Tanaan Jungle

Trial of the Gladiator

Battle Pet Breeding/Epic Pets

Multiple garrison features: the ability to put your garrison is various locations, renaming your epic followers, garrison Trophies for killing rares/elite mobs in Draenor, Building Garrison Defences, Diablo 3-style transmog system 

------------------------------------

 Not sure how anyone can reconcile this. Never in the history of WoW have so many features been removed or scrapped. 




 As a child of the '60's I can tell you that people were out more and interacting. In neighborhoods and city streets. I watched that change and have some theories on it. 




 Aunt Thomasina. 




 Ok get the other one. We can still dual wield. Get the glowing green feathered shoulders and the green mail robe and gloves (LW pattern) and hang out in your main city - with a green pet. :) 




 Yes, it took two mini patches. Thanks! 




 See http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3995xq/new_to_this_game/ 




 I think the writer is full of shit. I have known two black players on the game - one of whom was my exclusive running buddy for the past 8 months. Well past the time we hit 100 we used to pop in and do LFD to help strangers get their Leeroy. My friend? He would have said something if he sensed any racism about it. He thought it was funny as hell.

 




 My raider in vanilla was my pally, mage for bc / wrath (hunter was pvp) then I reversed that with hunter and mage for cata. MOP Hunter/pally raiding. 

I decided to focus 100% on the hunter last half of MOP and started her first in WoD, not knowing that they would fuck the Beast spec so badly that a dev even apologized on twitter and did an early mini patch to try to help fix them.  




 My point being, if I have a minimum range limit with the bow then I need to effectively melee. That means proper weaps- ability. AP used to be the go-to stat.  




 The hunter dead zone is impossible in several encounters in dungeons or raids. But if we got our unique pet abilities back and were allowed to melee and dual wield again, it would be fun in pvp. 

I played with that 'dead zone' for a long time on my hunter. It just can't be done without bringing the other elements back, including proper traps instead of the bullshit we have now. 

Edit: about my first sentence there. Here is an example: The [End Time in Cata](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugSVZK-k4PM/maxresdefault.jpg). You had to be within the circle of lights on the encounters, remember? If you were within those- as you needed to be - you were too close range to shoot the boss.  If you stepped back to where you were at closest range to shoot- you were outside the light and only did about 10% to 20% damage. 

It was like an Anti Hunter encounter.  




 I absolutely agree with everything you said. Not only have they made classes homogenous- they did the same thing with hunter pets.

One of the Fun things about having a hunter was going out and getting elusive pets that had unique abilities (like horn toss for rhinos or snatch (disarm) for birds etc). These abilities were then useful for different encounters, battlegrounds, enemies, etc. It was part of being a well-rounded hunter. 

Now all the pets are just buff machines for the raid.  

Give me those pet abilities back- plus the hunter melee abilities we used to be able to use, including dual wielding for close encounters (I still have my Edge of Chaos and Sundered Bone axe in the bank) and full-on aggressive mode for pets- and I will gladly give up my several yards.

I used to love parking my cat at flags - on aggressive and prowl (stealthed with burst damage coming out) and watch it pop out -stunning the crap out of the would-be flag stealer and wrecking them while I threw traps and arcane shot. Yea, I'll give up my close up yards for that. But I don't think you would like it. 




 As a player with a 100 druid healer- I applaud you for posting this.  




 I'm hostile about it because it's the first time since I started playing that - for any toon - the ability imbalance forced me to play a spec I never wanted to play. It lost the element of fun. Same thing that many others are complaining about. 

I am pissed because Blizzard, to my mind, has ruined the game to the point where I had to unsub to protest after 10 yrs consistent subbing. I even kept my sub through business trips overseas and hiatuses when I couldn't play at all or took a break for a few months.

They decided to chase a trend of social network/Facebook style games instead of sticking to the formula everyone loved.

It's like Paul Sams (former COO Blizzard) said in his first interview this week after leaving Blizzard:

**Paul Sams**: 

First and foremost, *I learned that you must put game quality and player experience first in everything that you do.* Gamers are not driven to buy games because they have a clever business model, they buy games that are *fun and immersive that deliver on what was promised.* I also learned that being a trend chaser or first mover is not a key to victory. 

*Force feeding a development team to chase a business model or game type trend* when the team doesn't love it is a likely losing proposition. A happy and motivated team that is making a game that they absolutely love *with a leadership team that doesn't force them to ship their game before it is ready is part of that formula for success.* 




 We used to co-raid with Conquest, Kilrogg. They had a kid in there like that. Awesome player and everyone would think he was a 30 yr old raider .. until he got on vent.  




 Nice attitude there Chuck. 

Maybe you think people should just get a whole suit of epics simply for buying the game? 

Part of what is wrong with the game now is the loss of a sense of accomplishment that comes from spending time excelling and focusing on a task, then succeeding. Those are the memories that stand out and make you smile. 




 I unsubbed this week for the first time in 10 yrs. I have always, until now, been able to play how I wanted. I won't play again until blizzard gets us back to the WORLD of Warcraft instead of the Facebook/UI/game WoD turned it into. 




 Old school trick. For the first trip to Menethil from IF we used to jump off of one spot on the dam at Loch Modan. It was a death leap but if you did it right you would end up at the GY at Menethil. Bingo flight path. Saved the run past those damn spiders, which killed you anyway, most likely.  




 So I am in a WoD dungeon the first time. My Hunter - I have been playing and raiding with her since July 05. 

We get in there - first pull on a group mob- all is clear behind them.. I set my pet on the target - pet hits the target. Then I use Barrage- same main target ...and the ammo is going *through my body* to hit a mob that is across the room behind me. I swear to fucking christ if the DL hadn't seen it himself and started laughing and freaking out I probably would have been kicked. 

Next area. My pet and the Lock pet both start going crazy in the room- like they are stuck on these paths like a tram on rails and going a hundred miles an hour. 

Fuck me if we didn't pull every damn thing there. Thankfully we were with old school experienced players that knew stuff was bugging out.  




  level ranks gone, and fuck buying spells.

I really loved level ranks for spells. For example with a pvp mage I kept lvl 1 or 2 Blizzard and Arcane Nova keybound and could constantly pop around or blizzard areas to uncover stealthed enemies and only use tiny amounts of mana. Also, if a lower level wanted mana/health food I could make that for them. I can't do that now. 

There were benefits to all of my toons to be able to access lower level spells/abilities.  




 All hybrids. I loved my shockadin.  




 Seriously? But.. cheetahs are the cat that does go supersonic- so that makes absolutely.. oh yea.  




 I think the Deer travel form art and animation is some of the best done in the game. Someone studied deer/elk.  




 My bear ass still looks like a pointy pentagon. 




 Hunter

Lore: Cry havoc and unleash the Stampede of war.

Player: Fucking Blizzard, making me go Marks when I been playing Beast for 9 years. 

How I felt throughout Highmaul.

 No dude. Tanking Wars were worse than worthless in tm vs ss. 




 Fucking brilliant, praise Uther! 




 Not only legendaries- but it used to be getting a purple was a big deal. Now there are low lvl new people running around decked in purps. I will never forget the first one that I got - at lvl 60 in Vanilla MC. 




 As an economist once said, "Both a poor man and a rich man can choose which bridge to sleep under." 




 That's the one I was considering. Especially if she has psychically picked up on Jons true parentage. 




 I don't know, man. She is so evil- I had a suspicion that she is possibly doing all she can to eradicate the Baratheons. We will see. 




 Weird. I have adblock on and got no message. If I had I would not have posted that particular video. I'm sorry bout that. 




 I thought I was the only one that tried to use google to see if I could locate a place and see what's still there. Howdy!

Amazing how bustling and busy everything looked back in the day. Streets look positively empty now. 




 Same for some of us women. I need quiet like a polar bear needs ice. The hubby can never take a clue on that it seems. I think this is more a 'human' issue than male/female. 




 Yes but we don't leave our hand in our bra, cupping our boob, for upwards of 30 minutes - heh. 




 I taught a class on Nostradamus. I taught them that this 'sept' did not mean "7th month", that was a crock. 

Also, when calculating the difference between the calendar of Nostradamus day and ours - 1999 would actually be 2001. "King of the Mongols'' is also wrong.

I taught this class in the mid-1990's. 

L'an mil neuf cens nonante neuf sept mois,
Du ciel viendra un gran Roy d'effrayeur.
Resusciter le grand Roy d'Angolmois.
Avant apres Mars regner par bon heur.

The year 1999, Sept,
From the sky will come a great King of Terror.
To bring back to life the great King of the Mongols,
Before and after Mars to reign by good luck.

Your post just reminded me of this. Now back to your regularly scheduled program.  




 I don't think I could ever 'cull' any. They just hang out and breed and have a good time. I feed them Wardley pleco algae tabs a few times a week. Otherwise they eat leftovers. 




 I keep thinking that after she kills / removes everything from Stannis, once he is a completely broken man, she will declare another person the 'real king'.  




 I absolutely agree with you- having read all of the books multiple times and now watching the show. 

I don't know how anyone can make dany out to be a villain...if anything she was too kind in not executing every one of the masters- or letting the slaves do it. 

And Stannis is an rigid, arrogant, uptight, unfeeling asshole who just watched his only child burn to death.  

Let it begin.  




 At one time Route 19 in Florida had massive Jacaranda tree tunnels over long stretches. The ones from Crystal River to south of New Port Richey were astonishing. Bigger and more lush than in the picture here. But the greed heads came through, cut them all down, widened the road and stuck malls and mall parking lots all up and down the stretch. Some of those are abandoned now.

They could have made a secondary road for not much more money. Apparently someone hated trees, especially giant, lush purple blossomed trees that people would drive down from all over just to see.  

 




 Something like this happened in the early 60's to someones daughter that I knew. But the 2 cops took her around the corner and felt her up.

So the dad, grandpa and a few cousins and brothers went to the station and waited out back for the weasels to get off work. When they came out in their civvies they drug them into an alley and 'gave them the beat-down of their lives'. Along with a threat to do it again and worse. 

People are too complacent these days.

 I was thinking, just strip down in court.  







































 First one I experienced was sitting on one of those cement benches outside the San Fran airport by the drop off zone. Thought at first that there was a big truck rolling up - but it just kept rocking. 




 Some of the worst after-disaster injuries I have seen were to the feet- hurricanes and tornados. I suppose house damage is all the same- lots of broken glass, nails, etc. At least have a pair of heavy soled shoes waiting by the door.  




 Ramsey gets turned into a white walker. White Walker Bolton. You only thought he was bad before. 




 You missed just a few things:

* Tyrion is introduced to the captive dragons. They love him because he is actually the son of Joanna Lannister and Aerys Targaryon. He sneaks down during the Pit fight and releases them. They all frolic like puppies together then go burn all the masters to death. No one makes fun of Tyrion, the Dragon Rider, ever, again.

* Jorah Mormont wins the Pit fight like the man he is- then discovers that dragons blood is the cure for Stone. A dragon graciously dribbles a little blood on his patch- curing him. He and Dany kiss and make up.



 




 Start with the events that leads to this:

Aegon: Yield now, and you may remain as Lord of the Iron Islands. Yield now, and your sons will live to rule after you. I have eight thousand men outside your walls.

Harren: What is outside my walls is of no concern to me. Those walls are strong and thick.

Aegon: But not so high as to keep out dragons. Dragons fly.

Harren: I built in stone. Stone does not burn.

Aegon: When the sun sets, your line shall end.

Issue with that big community center. It is closed on Sunday and closed on Saturday unless you rent space for an event.

It's only open until 7pm the days it is open. So for working folks, guess what? The million dollar facility does you absolutely no good at all. Seniors and soccer mom hours. I understand now what this man is trying to do.

 I would probably start at the wiki that is on her and go from there. 




 Oh I was so upset about it when I saw the first news article. And it was about gopher tortoises in florida- endangered. Poor things.  




 Tortoise. And they can't swim like turtles no matter how many stupid fucking idiots throw them in ponds. Which I just found out this year was happening all over the south.  









 General? These posts were made within a few days of her abduction in 2011.

9 Miles NE - is exact. (to Zach Adams property)

Near/in a hunting preserve - is exact. (Eby's hunting preserve borders Adams property)

Tall, energetic (almost manic) man with reddish blond hair, blue eyes, ruddy, florid complexion, always kind of "wound up" - is exactly [descriptive of Zach Adams.](https://billwarnermyblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/2c29b-1795590_737386016306812_1563872713_n.jpg)

3 men altogether being the main perpetrators, two younger and one older - is exact. (and not normal in serial killer cases)

All of them are well known in the area - is exact.

That they have been arrested for breaking and entering, drugs, etc - is exact.

That they were part of a club/cult - is exact (the A Team, they called themselves)

Father/grandfather owning the property - is exact.

15 miles NE (where they found the remains) - is exact.

Video, pictures, media being important to the case - is exact.

That she was decapitated - is exact. 

That military or government land is involved - is exact. (where they found her remains is state property and also behind the Adams property, intersecting the Ebys Hunting reserve, is federal property).

Orange being a 'big' color as well as red - is exact. (Zachs grandfathers house and barn/storage area have a bright orange roofs- starkly stands out on the map. Zach had a red vehicle.

That birds - bird names are involved - is exact (Adams house is bordered by Duck Farm road and Eagle Creek)

That they would be caught - is exact.

Fairly general? I would say it's damn amazing. I would also say you didn't bother to read my post, but came in with a pre-concieved belief system and were really responding to that, rather than the facts.





 




 How it's never been mentioned that suspects in the Holly Bobo case are also somehow involved in the Kristie Moon disappearance:

 Kristie Baugus Moon was dating Michael Pearcy when she disappeared 10/27/1999. According to her mother, he was the last one to see her.
 
 Michael Pearcy is the son of Mark Pearcy- both Mark and Jeff Pearcy are under arrest for being accessories and accessories after the fact in the Holly Bobo kidnapping and murder.

That is from an article I wrote after digging around for info on the Bobo case some months back- at:

http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2fxx1l/kristie_moon_disappearance_connection_with_holly/

I haven't yet seen mention of this in any articles. It's like they want the Kristie Moon case to just blow away with the wind. And the Holly Bobo case is just fucked beyond recognition.  




 Fabulous write up. Thank you, it's a fascinating bit of Americana.

Could you (or would you) post the address so we can see the house on Google Maps? This is probably as real a haunted house as any recorded.  




 The worst stories of inhumanity I ever read were of the Ustase.

 Great and gorgeous. 




 We had shots of our smoking court in my late 70's yearbook. It was not a big deal back then. 

There was not a plethora of uptight, thin lipped, disapproving, unbending, tightasses lurking around every corner waiting to smash anything outside of the right wing, talibanish, christian coalition or left wing 'gotta control people for their own good' elements. . Everything was so 'live and let live' back then. 

What the hell happened? 




 All of us. I take that back. One boy died from falling off a parking garage after a concert and another had a rare brain aneurysm at age 22 that killed him instantly.  




 Reminds me of an old torture method used by (either the Japanese or Koreans- can't recall right now) where they would starve two military prisoners and then offer each the chance to feed the other a piece of bread or eat it themselves. Either starve or let your combat partner starve.

This is just about that fucking disgusting and egregious. 

I'm finding the advertisers and calling all of them. 




 they have been working hand in hand with the multinational and 'too big to fail' corporations to turn us into a large 3rd world labor force.

Haven't you noticed the massive astroturfing against Unions and labor protections? The massive inequality? Pulling the safety net (actually an outright war on the poor lately), turning 'low education' people against those in poverty- against union and labor and pollution protections? 

It keeps up and we will be as well off as Bangladesh. 

 




 Wouldn't it be cool to have a massive walk-in closet? 

Another thing sorely lacking in garrisons  :D  




 Not back when we had unlimited sheeps with no cd :D 




 Why, yes. [Yes it does.](http://www.newlanark.org/uploads/image/CLT3.jpg)  




 Well he was off by half an ocean and 20 hours. 

Edit: I just found his video. He actually [dated it for the 30th](https://youtu.be/E7zUdVouS4A?t=5m35s)

And weirdly enough, he said for not only the west coast of the US but [for all of the pacific areas that are prone to earthquakes.](https://youtu.be/E7zUdVouS4A?t=8m50s). And we had this [large Japan Quake today, the 30th.](http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201505300062)

So. Not sure what to think of all of that. So far the guy is 2 for 2 as his unedited Facebook page also predicted the Nepal quake to the day and almost the hour. 

This is not the sub for this, agreed. But I am always interested in a bit of #wierdness.  

 









 You beat me to it gereth:) West coaster here.

   boars are relatively rare.

No, they aren't. A lot of people have them but don't ride them because of the animation.
 




 It actually makes me extremely sad to see my favorite game turned into this.

Me too. I did't mind dropping money for store mounts until now. And that purple cat is my favorite. But I won't buy it from principle. 




 I don't know. I did ogre beads for the real ones. 




 I still have [Carrot on a Stick] on two toons banks. Hoarder in game. 




 *grabs cane and puts uppers in*

...And I did the same with my gnome, for a cat mount. But it was harder because my legs are shorter. And people on my server had never seen a gnome on a massive cat before me, and it was good. But no one ever asked me to dance. Anywhere. 




 I swear I have been wondering if they hired some 3rd world hack/code company for the '250' new developers. I about cried when I saw what they did to my NE female. She runs like a linebacker- on quaaludes. They all look horrible. I have to keep the new art turned off- too distracting to play.  




 Apparently so do the WoD mount animators.  




 Reminded me more of a McDonalds wind up toy. 




 Old school doctors used to commonly give family members 'pain pills' to help people along who were dying of painful illnesses. Like, "..be careful, more than 5 of these will stop the heart." Unspoken but understood. 




 That's why I started /r/StormComing. There have been so many extreme weather incidents not being reported - starting a few years ago it seems - that I thought there needed to be a place for them. 




 If these millions in payouts were coming out of the FOP Retirement funds this shit would stop yesterday. 




 And I am sure it scarred her daughters for life- as it did her husband.  




 Exactly.  




  I still oppose assisted suicide.

This is fine, for you. But you should not oppose it for others if that is their choice. All I could think of while reading this is please do not let me go out this way. I will bypass chemo or any level of modern medicine besides pain meds to go quicker and less traumatically- just as most doctors do. I have thought about this for a long time now- and this story just reinforces it. 
 




 I would have played more and harder, gotten closer to some people and enjoyed it while it was great. 




 Now THAT was pvp :) 




 Asbestos was an awesome guild :) 




 Text from a post about this:

A little trip down memory lane. 
Flickr Album: https://www.flickr.com/photos/11499710@N00/

From early 40 man raids through the surprise appearance (and downing) of the BC launch Bosses, to massive Horde/Alliance raids and battles to the Shan Bu World Tour, (kited by Amaruca and my hunter, Astromeria.)

If you were with Angelic Reign, Conquest, Still Life, Angelic Crusade (Angelic Reigns Raid Guild), Asbestos, Circle of Truth, Reservoir Dogs and some others- you might see yourself in these shots.

Enjoy: 





























 Bring in some alligators and charge a few bucks at the gate. That's what they do in Florida. 




 Incredible shot. Thanks for sharing. 









 You forgot the /s :) 




 and the numbers are still higher than the end of MoP.

[End of MOP 7.4, end of March, 7.1.](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/)

Reforging was a method of fine tuning and personalizing a character. *If you didn't want to use it, you didn't have to.* And as MOP RNG was not as whack as it is in WoD, not necessary. As bad as RNG is in WoD (especially Highmaul gear and random stats on made items) it would be a welcome relief.

A lot of people enjoy spending time fine tuning and personalizing their character so that they were not just generic copies of other Pally's, DK's, etc. For instance, I loved my shockadin.

There was no reason not to leave reforging in the game. 




 We are in a minimal El Nino right now. As in,[ it is weak to moderate.](http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/anomnight.current.gif)

Compare that to a [strong El Nino](https://youtu.be/9rPqIuXlWuA?t=44s)

There is a 80%-90% possibility we may get a strong El Nino in the near future, but it will take a little time even as it strengthens to generate observable effects.

There is an approximately 90% chance that El Nio will become enhanced or strong through Northern Hemisphere summer 2015, 80% throughout 2015. 




 After leveling 2 toons to 100, I boosted my old druid to 90 who, embarrassing enough, was still at 60 from 40 man progression. I leveled to 100 through WoD.

Since there were areas of the world she missed through that, I did a ground mount only run from Ghostlands to Booty Bay last week. I wanted to enjoy the music and scenery and take my time- hitting every raid in between, from Zul Aman to Zul Gurub. 

I opened it up on the LFR and had three people by Zul Aman (all 100's) who had never been in ZA (shockingly to me). From there out we ranged between 10 and 15 players the rest of the way. Mostly 100's. 

People ended up leading mini tours through their favorite areas, and it just kind of happened that way. I showed them Rausche's grave and it was pretty goosebumpy. Then another person wanted to show everyone something else and it just took off from there. 

Best day on wow in months and months. 




 I leveled 3 100's and have blocked my other alts from progressing past 90. I don't go to draenor any longer- haven't for over a month. And I cancelled. 




 It was Blizz fault the moment they decided to blend server populations.  




 Blended servers :( 




 Oh yes, and they hate FEMA. Not a good mix.

Edit: Ok so not always. Ted Cruz voted down FEMA and emergency funds for Hurricane Sandy, but is screaming for federal funds for Texas' current disaster. http://thedailybanter.com/2015/05/ted-cruzs-mind-blowing-hypocrisy-on-texas-floods-shows-idiocy-of-republican-philosophy/ 




 face the consequences for doing so.

Blizzard is 'facing the consequences' right now- losing over 3M subs.

Actually since you aren't a professional pollster, remarks such as "Not a SINGLE person liked reforging when we had it" and all of your other subjective remarks are absolutely worthless. 

I and every other player I know, from casual to raider, liked reforging. The 3rd party apps just simplified it. 

And.. I have never, ever heard or read a player complaining about flying. That is inconceivable to me as a 10 yr player. 

I have seen a lot of blizzard apologists lately. Considering that many of the more rabid ones ("I HATE FLYING!!") are probably Blizzard employees sent out to try to prop up a dead horse- you are pretty damn extreme.  









  I don't understand why people are so dramatic when it comes to cancelling your subscription to this game.

I have one of the oldest guilds on an original vanilla server. Through the years we have made friendships - some 10 years old now. We have also lost a few people due to tragedies and illnesses. 

In our case we lost 2 friends to long term illnesses that were made a bit more bearable by the game. In these cases family members came on and met us after their passing, to request that we never remove them from our roster. And they are still there. 

So the whole "just cancel your sub and quit whining, it's only a game!" doesn't always meet with reality. 

 




 This is a great, illustrative post reflecting exactly how I have seen the evolution of the game since cross-realm. 

And the streamlining? I leveled a new toon last week to check the leveling process- I never died, I needed no help to do any of it and I popped a new level about every 3-5 quests- never finishing a quest chain. 

You can bypass entire sections of the world now. What a waste.  




 When we used to know other players, (no cross-realm) and have mount parades in IF, kite dragons/bosses to major cities, have snowball fights in the tram, etc. etc. 




 Unfortunately  I hear it is one mass apex grind for the most part. 




 In 10 yrs I never, ever heard anyone saying the game was 'too social'. Quite the opposite, a lot of people said the social aspect was what kept them in the game at periods that the content grew stale. 




 Because we screamed, yelled and threw a huge fit. One spec being 10 times more effective than the other spec? That was bullshit. 

Blizz actually apologized for this screw up.  




 ok... 




 Yep.

Point being- it's fun to swoop and fly through the air with your friends into a gorgeous sky, over a remarkable landscape. 




 They had said they were going to make an MOP style start- flying at end level but ground mount through leveling. I had no problem with that. If they had told the truth I never would have upgraded. 




 This was my concern, that a 'stuck' weather pattern may not ease up on this for some time. Just like the 'stuck' weather pattern that brought the drought to Ca and the months of flooding to the UK last year.

The reason for these stalled weather patterns is here:
https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU 

It's not what you might think. But it's the only thing that makes sense.

 Ok, if you insist.

C/P from the Warcraft forums says it all: WoD has been a contraction. Not an expansion.

Fixing Stormwind

----------------------------------

Has this expansion removed more than it has added?! We paid 20% more and waited 14+ months for this? Can anyone reconcile this? Never in the history of WoW have so many features been removed or scrapped. I think the community deserve an answer. 




 This whole 'anti-flying' thing is so strange. They are so vicious about it. 

No one is stopping them from walking-ground mounting anywhere they want to. 

It's almost like blizzard put a bunch of their 'new developers' out there to belittle and attack players who like to fly to try to lead the conversation. 




 Yep.. I am just one of going on 4 million players who have quit the game. Why should blizzard care about that?

From the nasty attitude of white knights like you- it apparently can't happen soon enough. That's another thing I miss about old Wow. How cool and friendly most players were. Now too many of them on the forums act like 4chan rejects. If you want to walk- then fucking walk- no one is stopping you. 

 




 Yes they did.  









 Henry Lee Lucas looks like George W. Bush in some shots. 




 Notice that all of the advertisements for the new purple cat mount show it flying over Shadowmoon Valley in Draenor?

 I guess when you have been paying a monthly fee for 10 years to a company you get to feel a little 'entitled' to get at *least* the same level of service you got from the preceding years. 

Or perhaps you are the kind of person who pays for a steak and is afraid to complain when the waitress flops a hamburger on your plate.

 




 10yr player here. The continual addition of unique content and expansion of capabilities, like flying, is exactly why I and millions of other players re-subbed month after month for years. 

 




 Pre-purchase for Draenor included a Raven flying mount and a promise by developers that flying will come 'later on'. 

It's like pre-purchasing a meal that includes a steak knife as part of the deal, but the dinner consists of stale bread and water with a promise of a steak 'later on'. So you then you get to 'later on' - and they don't even throw you a crumb. 

https://youtu.be/UqJdkV6iiFA 




 I have been reading the forums for years. I have never, ever seen this many upset players in all of those years. Something went terribly wrong here and it is time for Blizzard to fix it if they actually care more about the game and player base than the stockholders. 




 I was wondering about this. I am unsubbing when my last month is over. The news about flying was the final nail in that coffin, on top of the no-content train wreck of WoD. I was wondering if anyone at blizzard would be curious as to why I am unsubbing after 10 yrs.

About the 'no flying' bit:

I had a buddy who was doing design for Blizzard and she talked about the time and creativity it took to allow for play on the Z plane. 

They had to hire extra people and put in extra hours to prep areas like Elwynn forest for flight because they have unpatched, untexturized landscapes that can't be seen from a riding mount and that need finished for flight. There are also elements to coding and design that make it a bit more difficult to implement than simple ground tracking.

The (until Wod) incredible content and finish of the game is why I have paid them a monthly fee for 10 yrs. I am not going to go backwards and forego a real pleasure of the game in order to keep developers 'happy' at this stage, or save blizzard money in developer salaries.

If anti-flight players want to walk, go for it. I'm not stopping you and neither is blizzard.
 




 I did too. We used to re-train promising, 4-6yr old retired race-horses as hunter/jumpers. Getting a bit long in the tooth for more than a little pleasure and trail riding now, though. My last two horses are totally retired. Did you ever ride with your mom and sister? 




 That is gorgeous. What a joy.

I used to do 3 Day Eventing in the midwest.

 Notice all of these 'life goals' go toward supporting a system that you didn't create and that benefits people and groups that run that same system. 




 Recently an upscale family owned restaurant in our area sold and had a re-design, now the logo on the sign (stylized CW) looks like a kangaroo fetus from the road.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/26/world/africa/hero-rats-sniff-out-landmines-and-tb/ 




 I was being a bit sarcastic, but the basis is true:

The precedence set here is: "Too many bullets from too many directions hit this couple for us to determine if the defendants gun fired the actual, killing blow, therefore it doesn't meet the standard of 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. 

Court precedence can be used in any future court case to justify defenses in other cases, regardless of the status of the defendent/citizen.

 
























 My first memory. Seeing grown-ups, grannies, moms and dads standing around crying. Coming to our house to watch our TV and worse, my dad crying in his room, walking in on him.

 Or is there a connection between dreams and reality that we cannot yet adequately explain?

I collect prophetic dreams from various places online. Here is one of them that I am sure relates to the Japanese quake and tsunami of March '11.

 7-30-90 A friend of mine was told in meditation to expect 400,000 casualties in the future. I meditated on it to pinpoint the event.

 Meditation: I called Babaji to confirm or deny the previous vision of my friend.

 A. He said, "We will use this as a testimony to the future."

 I saw many, many oriental faces. All of them were running from the right toward the left. They were all saying, "You are right, you are right, you are right"

 I saw some kind of game going on. The voice said, "I haven't done this in quite awhile. Slow down, slow down."

 I saw a three dimensional map. The voice said, "There will be a radioactive factor of 80%".

 I saw a circus in the foreground and great destruction in the background and it came to me that this referred to the 'Olympics'.

 NOTE: 1998 is the first Olympics to be held in Japan.

 NOTE: 1998, THE Olympics were held and there was a SMALL earthquake. Nothing of any consequence occurred there.

---------------------

The interesting thing is that the Japanese had to convince the Olympic Committee that the Fukushima radiation was not a danger in order to be chosen for the next Olympics 'against a backdrop of total destruction'. 

About the "I haven't done this in a while." The areas flooded in 2011 closely matched those of a tsunami that hit Sendai in 869.

People running 'right to left' would be from the ocean, inland (to escape the tsunami).

So I find prophetic dreams/visions to be very interesting. Maybe complete coincidence, but maybe something else. Either way they fascinate me. 




 Well thank you!  




 Guess what? I spent a couple of years studying the links. What countries suffer this, what countries do not, what are the links and similarities and dissimilarities. 

 I didn't do it for you- or to write a thesis, I did it for my own curiosity without intentions of even discussing it. 

Now. I have spent enough time handing you my thoughts on this.

Take it or leave it. Looks like you are already seeing through a biased lens so I well know I am completely wasting my time.

It is simply not a credible source for information on psychiatry or psychiatric drugs.

It has legitimate citations- which are FDA, etc. That page just puts them all one handy link. I don't care if it's a monkey writing in his shit on the wall- if it has good citations then I am good with it. But that's just my legal research training kicking in.

 I have studied this intensively. There are several countries where school/mass shootings have never happened. Some of those countries allow guns. 

Here is one thing that I have dug up that all US school shootings have in common: The shooters are all on prescribed psychiatric drugs. Every one of them. And I found this:

http://www.cchr.org/sites/default/files/International_Warnings_on_Psychiatric_Drugs_Suicide_Homicide.pdf

Those drugs are banned or highly restricted in those aforementioned countries. Our Columbine shooters were on a total of three of them. Klebold was on Paxil and Zoloft, both. and 

Harris became obsessed with homicidal and suicidal thoughts within weeks after he began taking Zoloft, according to Dr. Tracy.  Due to his obsession with killing, Harris was switched to Luvox, which was in his system at the time of the shooting, according to his autopsy. However, the change from Zoloft to Luvox is like switching from Pepsi to Coke, Dr. Tracy said.

 [Markleeville](http://www.ebbettspassadventures.com/places/markleeville.html) - Ebbetts Pass. My favorite stomping grounds. Feeling bad here. 









 They are protesting having their water and electricity shut off for periods of the day as well as lack of basic medical care. In a lot of the poorer regions the water has been privatized and they have to pay for cold water instead of it being covered (as previous) by taxes.

Like one man said- they were trying to get help for a firefighter and the hospital couldn't give them cold water- they had to go buy it to cool him off. 

This is one of my serious pet peeves- the privatization of anything that can impact human health and welfare. Because the people profiting don't give a fuck if you die in the street- profit margin trumps life every time. 




 Wow. This is horrifying.

 The fact that were seeing multiple toxins at the same time, were seeing high levels of domoic acid, and were seeing a coastwide bloom  those are indications that this is unprecedented, Trainer said.
 
 Scientists suspect this years unseasonably high temperatures are playing a role, along with the blob  a vast pool of unusually warm water that blossomed in the northeastern Pacific late last year. 
 
 This is new territory for us, Ayres said. Weve never had to close essentially half our coast.

  The French Resistance undertook nearly 1,000 acts of sabotage in the hours after the Normandy invasion began, and the damage they inflicted on railroads and other communications played a crucial role in preventing German reinforcements from arriving quickly in Northern France. 
 
 And every time a German troop train was sabotaged, a nearby French village was likely to suffer horrendous retaliation -- like the town of Tulle, where a hundred men where seized at random and massacred three days after the Normandy invasion, or the village of Oradour-sur-Glane, where 642 citizens, including 205 children, were killed the day after that. The men were shot; the women and children were burned to death in a church.
 
 "We were depending on considerable assistance from the insurrectionists in France," Eisenhower remembered. "Throughout France the Free French had been of inestimable value in the campaign. ... Without their great assistance the liberation of France and the defeat of the enemy in Western Europe would have consumed a much longer time and meant greater losses to ourselves."

 My great grandmothers big victorian house was built by her father on several acres in 1920. My great grandmother lived in that house until the 1980's when she passed away.

Sometime in the late 1940's she had a medical issue that made it hard for her to climb stairs, so her husband built this little, one bedroom cottage with a bay window and all of the amenities a ways back on the property where she could recuperate. He built that rose trellis, planted the climbing roses and planted a garden around it (unfortunately is not visible in the pictures)

After grans recuperation the 'little house' was used for everything from family members needing a resting place from troubles to honeymoon quarters.

Sorry about the potato quality pics. 
 









 Not sure if you are familiar with 2010 heat wave, or the 2009:

By the time the heatwaves had ended in late October 2010, about $500 billion (2011 USD) of damage was done, in the Northern Hemisphere alone. The heat waves had caused around 17,905,000 deaths globally, with 3,000+ direct, 17,821,672+ indirect, and 21+ unconfirmed deaths

Russia: On July 30, wildfires killed 25 people, leaving more than 2000 people homeless. The fires were still burning on 1 August.

Likely in part due to the heat wave and smoke from forest fires, Moscow recorded 14,340 total deaths in the month of July, 4,824 more than the number recorded in July 2009. Pollution levels in the city were five times higher than normal.

 A lot of people think differently, but it takes a brave soul to express it. 




 This is the problem with mass poverty. When people are poor they cannot escape climate or geophysical catastrophes. If they don't work that day- their families don't eat that day.  




  Debate isn't the definition of freedom of speech, your right to say, think, write, and create whatever you want is your freedom of speech, and it should never be limited.

Your free speech is limited every day. You cannot, for example, speak in a way that threatens the life of another or incites rioting or panic.

Another way it is limited is by peer pressure - this is an internal limitation created by our instinct to 'go along with the group'. This is a safety instinct that all people have to a greater or lesser degree. People who internalize a lot of fear or self-doubt are more willing to 'go along', even despite their real feelings. 

See: Lord of the Flies. 
 




  ppl you never imagined as racists will start flying it at their houses just to make a point.

Best answer to that? Make fun of their ignorant asses to the point where the only 'point' is how stupid they are:

As John Oliver said: 

The confederate flag is one of those symbols that should really only be seen on t-shirts, belt buckles and bumper stickers to help the rest of us identify the worst people in the world.  




 This is because you have a population that is suffering, financially and under a great deal of stress. People are angry.

Then you have groups who are subtly misdirecting the source of the pain and anger toward those people they can lash out at - easy targets because of their skin color or sexual preference. Much easier to get mad at those gays or blacks than to try to go after a multinational banking system.

Then you have some marketing genius that came up with the term 'SJW' which is used in a derogatory manner to black-label people. A lot of redditors are cowed by that. 

I saw someone make a genius post about racism that was nearly on the level of a Martin Luther King. His post was highly accepted but then suddenly he was shouted down and bum-rushed the moment he was called an 'SJW'. 

Many Redditors, for all their proclamations of 'FREE SPEECH' are more groupthink creatures than they would ever admit. 




 I just posted this to someone else - but here goes

 StormFront is the opposite of free speech. There are no arguments against racism allowed on StormFront. Just try it and see how fast your free speech is banned there.

 Open forums where people can argue pro and con is free speech, which is why Reddit, even though it has some putrid subs, is not banned in Germany, Italy or France.

 




 StormFront is the opposite of free speech. There are no arguments against racism allowed on StormFront. Just try it and see how fast your free speech is stifled there.

  And do you remember the reactions of the citizenships that had 'no idea' about the terrible things being done?

It's like a german told me in the late 1960's when I questioned him about this.

He said that the attacks on the jews started with flyers - papering - being delivered that said negative things. Then eventually it reached the radio and newspapers. So everyone everyday was reading bad things about the jews and beginning to believe it.

In his neighborhood - there were 3 people on his block repeating these things, then 10, then eventually the majority, repeating them so often that even the most open minded began to believe or at least pretend to believe so as to not come under pressure.

And that every german adult with 'half a brain' knew exactly what was happening. They had just been 'primed' to not care and turn away.  




 Re-read my post. I didn't say that at all. 
I said that Sites (such as [StormFront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_\(website\))) are banned in countries in which negative PR against certain races was propagated to the point that a world war and genocide resulted. 

I can't criticize their choice to do so seeing the historical result that they experienced.

Reddit is not banned because on reddit there are many people of many creeds who go to racist subs and provide alternate viewpoints. Sites such as StormFront forums are a solid wall of hatred with no alternative viewpoint allowed. 

See the difference? 




 Did you see this? http://www.discogs.com/artist/2337287-Jim-Salvati 




 I was looking at some of your old newspapers of that era and they are so focused on this subject (anti-alcohol) that the stories and cartoons are almost Onion-like in their fervor. 




 The story of how Burnett's Mound protected Topeka from Tornados until they dug out the side of it for a water tank.

 It was always told by Chief Burnett that the mound must not be disturbed because it was a sacred place watched over by the Great Spirit and those who have past on must always be respected. The people of Kansas believed that by respecting the Chief's wishes that the mound would protect the city of Topeka from the devastating power of tornadoes.
 
 In 1960, Chief Burnett's mound was disturbed with construction at its base for an interstate bypass. Upon Burnett's Mound itself, it was cut into at the top of its north side, perfectly visual for all Topekans to view as its desecration continued to fit a 5 million gallon steel drum reservoir water tank. In the following years, building began to slowly progress around Burnett's Mound. 
 
 At 6:55PM on June 8, 1966, a tornado of immense power struck the city of Topeka, destroying all within its path. It lasted 34 minutes ending at 7:29PM. The F5 tornado was a half mile wide, as about 820 homes were destroyed and 3,000 damaged. Entire blocks were leveled to splinters in seconds. The tornado's violent winds had estimated at around 300 mph. 
 
 Total cost was put at $100,000,000.00 making it at the time the costliest tornado in American history. Even to this day, with inflation factored in, the Topeka tornado still stands as one of the costliest on record. The tornado claimed 16 lives, injured over 500 people, and left over 3500 homeless. 




 I'll just drop this on ya: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 




 There is no debate in Germany, Italy or France. They have had experience with this that lead to a World War and the genocide of millions. Hate sites are banned in those countries. I can't judge them for that, knowing their history.

I can't say for sure that Roof would have become racist from encountering racism in other ways, maybe meeting someone and being invited to a KKK meeting, for instance. I can just go by what he wrote of his personal experience in his death manifesto.  




 Roof said explicitly in his manifesto (that was released a couple of days ago) that he was not raised racist and he 'woke up' after discovering a white supremacist website online. 

So basically he would not have found the sanction and encouragement to be as racist as he became - racist enough to go on a shooting spree. 

What the hell can I say? It's a fucking shame, but it's a fact.  



















 Yea.. that damn horse is long gone. 




 Excellent response. I am so sick of hearing right wing commentators newscasters and politicians jumping through flaming hoops and tiptoeing over beds of nails to avoid mentioning 'race' in this incidence. 




 Identify and fix problems? The day it happened I posted about the problem of 24/7 racist sites - including subs on reddit- and how they can impact the weak minded. I got d/v to hell. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3a9ec9/charleston_church_shootingmanhunt_megathread/csbhgmt

When I was young I listened to Germans who escaped Germany talking to my great grandmother on a regular basis. I know what the effect of 'papering' (as they called the dissemination of racial tracts) can do to drive race-hate. People can deny it all they want but they need to face up to it. 

Once an belief has *sanction of approval* by seemingly large numbers of people or government action the believers tend to multiply like cockroaches and start acting out. The Confederate Flag on government land is one type of sanction of approval.  




 Everyone's just rushing to shut that fucking barn door, aren't they? 




 For a sec I thought the mom was on the right.  




 You would have to ask the red pill guys about that.  




 It's saddening really.

 Much better. I would widen the moons to match the width of the font lines. Perhaps even join them top and bottom in a sort of overlap. Also, work with each letter separately to make sure your [kerning](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kerning) is correct. It's somewhat off. 

Also shadowing- it can be a serious issue when you go to have any printing done. Ok for website work but not print. 

That being said, you might want to rethink the colors of the moons. 

A couple things to do while working: 

In between changes, take 5-6 steps back from the work and look at it from a distance. Also, take it down to 100px at it's widest and make sure it is still readable. 

GL- much better! 




 Very difficult to read. Dump the shading for solid blocks of color. Some letters fat others skinny and pointed. Way too much 'busy-ness with the moon overlays'. 

Remember- a logo is not supposed to be a work of art. A logo is an *impression hit*. Bam. Your viewer needs to be able to absorb it, mentally interpret it (and remember it) in a split second. 

Anytime a viewer has to spend even a whole second or two trying to interpret the impression, you lose. I had to 'work' on this one to read it. 

Needs a do-over. 




 I was trying to reply to the original commenter and missed the mark there. Yes we are.  




 Looks like my current desktop. A picture that I took in Antelope Canyon. How is the lake, btw? 




 I come from a long line of progressives and we had volunteers in every war up to and including Vietnam (although I think that that person only went because of the people we had in ww1 and ww2 and a belief that we were protecting the country as we had back then). We also had people a generation back march with blacks in Selma and my aunt used to take me to anti-war protests at the university. 

We also have a few gun owners in the family who keep them for safety. 

Watch the broad strokes there is all I am saying.  




 He went to the police and asked them to arrest him just before the events. They wouldn't because "he hadn't committed a crime." 

He had beat his wife twice. But back then in Texas it was not a crime to beat your wife.

edit: a letter. 




 I would never put red in an eye image- especially a cross-hair. 




 I always design for new (or lesser known) companies an iconic and text 'blended' logo that can be combined or stand alone as an icon or as text. 




 Exactly what I came in to say- trees gotta go. Change up the text a bit - you nailed it SolaVirtus. 




 I pointed this out- linked to /r/coontown - and people got huffy as hell with me for pointing out that some parts of the internet have provided a great deal of encouragement for guys like the shooter.

 30 years, man. Been doing this stuff too long.  




 For once, Disney designers screwed the pooch with this one. Even if we aren't calling it a 'logo' the design is bad. Hard to believe that they did this. The silhouettes are poorly placed   sized and combined with all of the little stars it looks very messy and distracting.

 I am very sorry to hear about your mother. I think it may help you to read this essay on a mans journey through his wifes cancer.

[Here.](http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a34905/matthew-teague-wife-cancer-essay/)

I decided years ago that if I had invasive cancer I would opt for palliative care only, following what our family doctor of many years did. Most doctors avoid aggressive treatment under these circumstances. This was only recently affirmed for me after reading the essay I linked above.

What I am saying here is that perhaps your mother felt this way also. And she took her own way out, not yours. 

All I know of Reiki is that there are some practitioners who work with a University medical center/hospice near me. I very much doubt that they reject standard medicine. 

I had a friend who was diagnosed with HIV in 1985. He was a Peruvian, but had been living in Utah for decades. He rejected "western medicine" and went with alternative therapies, marijuana, diet modifications, etc. This had nothing to do with 'religion', it was just his choice.

We went hiking and mountain climbing in 1999 and he looked and performed like an athlete. He wore me out.

In 2000 he went to the hospital for minor emergency surgery to remove his appendix. Surgery went great. He died a day later from an accidental overdose of morphine from the wrong setting on the self injection machine. 

It would have been easy for us to rage at standard medicine, but none of his loved ones chose to do so. 

I hope that if I get cancer that my children will be accepting of the choice I make and do not hold the people who assist me in that choice accountable for my death. 

And I truly hope you are able to release your anger and find some peace.

Watch it again. The car didn't move until rambo jumped out of his cop car and started shooting into it point blank. *Then* they tried to back away. 




 You be really careful out there. Stay hydrated and make sure you can wet yourself down.  




 Some cities [pay millions in lawsuits every year](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/14/charlotte-north-carolina-police-jonathan-ferrell-black-man) brought by bad actions by cops. 

If that money were coming out of the FOP Retirement funds instead of taxpayer pockets, this shit would stop yesterday. 




 They weren't being 'disobedient' to this cop. Their car was parked and not moving beside the other cop car. Until he jumped out of his car and immediately fired on them. 




 They were sitting there, parked beside the other cop car, until the shooter (cop) pulled up, jumped out of his car and started shooting at them point blank. *Then* they tried to back out. 




 I was just looking (and found his dad) but a lot of people drown on the Connecticut River. Something about how the water channels run that creates a suction kind of current. I am a great swimmer and would never go in that river without a life preserver after what I just read.

Apparently this artwork is going to be featured on the official podcast and the BBC Special. Her art was already featured on the Dr. Who 50th anniversary BBC special.

Damn amazing artist. Last I heard from her she was struggling to make money to get back into college. She was on the Deans List until she ran out of funds.

edit: The art is featured on Clonecast - start at the last 6 minutes for that particular remark: http://clonecast.libsyn.com

 Did you actually think I was 'slandering' the internet? I have been on the net since 1997. What I meant - and I shouldn't have to spell this out- was that with the proliferation of racist sites in the dark corners that people like this kid can get all the support he needs on his way to some hellish act or another.  









 Oh I see, I should never post blatantly racist subs on reddit to redditors. Is that the message? Or I should have posted something like [StormFront.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_(website) because it is off-reddit? 

Or are you saying that this isn't relevant? [Racist Internet Forums Linked to U.S. Hate Crimes](http://time.com/67840/racist-internet-forums-linked-to-u-s-hate-crimes/)

Because it is going on 24/7 on the internet and it is having an impact on weak minded individuals.

edit: and it's a week later and my remarks on the influence of online racism/white supremacy groups is absolutely correct.. you know.. the observations I made on this post that got down voted to hell by non-thinking, knee jerk redditors? gj there.

From his manifesto:

I was not raised in a racist home or environment......The event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case. I kept hearing and seeing his name, and eventually I decided to look him up. I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was. It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right. But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words black on White crime into Google, and I have never been the same since that day. The first website I came to was the Council of Conservative Citizens. 

There were pages upon pages of these brutal black on White murders. I was in disbelief. At this moment I realized that something was very wrong. How could the news be blowing up the Trayvon Martin case while hundreds of these black on White murders got ignored? 

From this point I researched deeper and found out what was happening in Europe. I saw that the same things were happening in England and France, and in all the other Western European countries. Again I found myself in disbelief.

 This is really a climate change joke in disguise. 




 I have just watched a couple of these and they were so cringe-worthy I could barely stand it.

One that sticks out was this harridan owner who was just horrible to her help and her husband. They had this menu that was just jam packed with all of these different meals that the chef could not cook and they could not keep up with in the kitchen. 

I would be interested in knowing if that one was still open or not, if anyone can recall it. 




 Thank you! Very cool. 




 With this [kind of 16th century ignorant bullshit](http://www.reddit.com/r/CoonTown/) going on 24/7 on the internets he probably thought he would be hailed as a hero, coast to coast.

edit:  It's almost a week later and it turns out that Roof wasn't raised racist, he adopted hard core racism from white nationalist websites   forums.  Exactly what I was pointing out in this post. Fuckers. 




 You mean like the guy shot in the back? 




 It amazes me that they aren't starting any desal operations on the west coast.

If return of salt is a problem, melt in the arctic is adding too much fresh water- I am sure barges can take salt north and slowly add it. Possibly as part of cargo operations of some kind or other. 









 And North Korea is going through a horrible drought. The massive rainfalls vs. horrendous droughts is so striking. 



















 Thank you very much. I appreciate your kind words.

 Then you could say that the drive for polio vaccines was 'a religion' or the belief in bacteria and viruses and drive to get people to use sanitation was 'a religion' - or any of the other scientific breakthroughs that improved the health and well being of mankind. 

The only controversy here is that there was not a multi-trillion dollar corporate body fighting against those things because they would impact their profit margin.

 Worship of Mana. 




 The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. 

The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small- 

**and for destroying those who destroy the earth."**

Rev. 11:18

One of Gods last acts toward mankind.

 I don't ask black conservatives anything. I don't talk to people who support the KKK.

Bill Clinton:

**Longest economic expansion in American history**

The President's strategy of fiscal discipline, open foreign markets and investments in the American people helped create the conditions for a record 115 months of economic expansion. Our economy has grown at an average of 4 percent per year since 1993.

**More than 22 million new jobs**

More than 22 million jobs were created in less than eight years -- the most ever under a single administration, and more than were created in the previous twelve years.

**Highest homeownership in American history**

A strong economy and fiscal discipline kept interest rates low, making it possible for more families to buy homes. The homeownership rate increased from 64.2 percent in 1992 to 67. 7 percent, the highest rate ever.

**Lowest unemployment in 30 years**

Unemployment dropped from more than 7 percent in 1993 to just 4.0 percent in November 2000. Unemployment for African Americans and Hispanics fell to the lowest rates on record, and the rate for women is the lowest in more than 40 years.

**Raised education standards, increased school choice, and doubled education and training investment**

Since 1992, reading and math scores have increased for 4th, 8th, and 12th graders, math SAT scores are at a 30-year high, the number of charter schools has grown from 1 to more than 2,000, forty-nine states have put in place standards in core subjects and federal investment in education and training has doubled.

**Largest expansion of college opportunity since the GI Bill**

President Clinton and Vice President Gore have nearly doubled financial aid for students by increasing Pell Grants to the largest award ever, expanding Federal Work-Study to allow 1 million students to work their way through college, and by creating new tax credits and scholarships such as Lifetime Learning tax credits and the HOPE scholarship. At the same time, taxpayers have saved $18 billion due to the decline in student loan defaults, increased collections and savings from the direct student loan program.

**Family and Medical Leave Act for 20 million Americans**

To help parents succeed at work and at home, President Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993. Over 20 million Americans have taken unpaid leave to care for a newborn child or sick family member.

**Smallest welfare rolls in 32 years**

The President pledged to end welfare as we know it and signed landmark bipartisan welfare reform legislation in 1996. Since then, caseloads have been cut in half, to the lowest level since 1968, and millions of parents have joined the workforce. People on welfare today are five times more likely to be working than in 1992.

**Higher incomes at all levels**

After falling by nearly $2,000 between 1988 and 1992, the median family's income rose by $6,338, after adjusting for inflation, since 1993. African American family income increased even more, rising by nearly $7,000 since 1993. After years of stagnant income growth among average and lower income families, all income brackets experienced double-digit growth since 1993. The bottom 20 percent saw the largest income growth at 16.3 percent. 




 Signs? No idea. In Panama City Beach (for instance) they have flagpoles up and down the beaches - Green flag for ok, Yellow for caution and Red means "do not get in the water", either rip tide, jellyfish outbreak or sharks spotted. 

They also go up and down the beach with 4 wheelers and megaphones and tell everyone to get out of the water. 

I am just stunned that they *left the beach open after an attack.*  




 Been a year and a half. I think of my husband every single day and probably cry once a week, still. I am still shocked sometimes that he is not here.  




 Fact. 




 And the white conservative motherfuckers hated him for it too. 




 The main issue is the dying middle class. People working two jobs just to get by don't have time or energy for leisure activities like fish keeping, nor the funds.  




 Both of them belong on /r/punchablefaces - right up there with Joffrey. 




 And that is the real entitlement group. 




 I tried to sell it to Mexico for a nickel. They wouldn't take it. 




 A lot comes down to them from the Sierra Snowpack- which we haven't had much of the past two years. 




 I wish our police in the US were like you guys, honestly, you are the best. 




 Borage is beautiful. It always reminded me of purple, fuzzy shooting star (dodecathion). They look adorable planted in clumps with each other in a cottagescape. 




 Absolutely nothing that can impact human lives, health and freedom- from prisons to hospitals to utilities (like your water supply) should ever, ever depend on a profit motive. 

 Some people will sell their mothers for profit- *your health or freedom means absolutely nothing to them.* 




 This is kind of dependent on where you are. The farther north you go the wetter it is. Or used to be. 




 All day? Used to take weeks to get those. 




 I listened to a speech (was interpreted by a friend) of an Indian Sociologist that counsels business. And most of what I got out of it was that they were outbreeding the rest of the world and had planned on beating China. 

And unfortunately, according to him, the schools are basically college mills that do not have the level of education as depicted on their diplomas. As long as you can pay for your semesters- you get a degree. 




 If I were a main stockholder of Activision/Blizzard and had dropped in to the forums anytime in the past two months- I would be making some phone calls and setting some folks hair on fire. 




 The Pitchforks are Coming .. for us Plutocrats. By plutocrat Nick Hanauer.


 Seeing where things are headed is the essence of entrepreneurship. And what do I see in our future now?
 
 I see pitchforks.
 
 But the problem isnt that we have inequality. Some inequality is intrinsic to any high-functioning capitalist economy. The problem is that inequality is at historically high levels and getting worse every day. Our country is rapidly becoming less a capitalist society and more a feudal society. Unless our policies change dramatically, the middle class will disappear, and we will be back to late 18th-century France. Before the revolution.
 
 And so I have a message for my fellow filthy rich, for all of us who live in our gated bubble worlds: Wake up, people. It wont last.
 
 If we dont do something to fix the glaring inequities in this economy, the pitchforks are going to come for us. No society can sustain this kind of rising inequality. In fact, there is no example in human history where wealth accumulated like this and the pitchforks didnt eventually come out. **You show me a highly unequal society, and I will show you a police state. Or an uprising. There are no counterexamples. None. Its not if, its when.**

 Just don't be Jorah Mormont. 




  They say they've doubled their work force for WoW. Where is it? It's sure not showing.

I have been worried that they contracted a 3rd world code sweatshop operation to save money and their 'new devs' are possibly all people who have never been able to afford to play the game. 

This would be the "HP effect" in action.
 




 Wow.. good thing they hired those 250 new 'devs'.  




 Not sure if it was the bitching (although I am sure that was a big part of it) so much as the leaving. I'll be interested in the numbers when they come out. 




 Come to think of it.. I'm not sure if I have actually seen WoD plate gear. If so, it wasn't memorable. 




 Yes, and after 10 yrs of playing solely Alliance through progressions, I got a nice statue.. of an Orc, my sworn enemy. 

Thanks Blizzard! 




 When we bought, we didnt plan on getting a place that looks like were living in an African savanna.

Whine. While Pacific islanders are losing their homes and land to rising seas, most of Bangladesh is flooding, people already in dire poverty are fleeing with what they can strap on their backs and oh my your lawn is brown. Heavens to betsy! 

Maybe these asshats should have thought about all of this back when they first heard about Climate Change and put some of that wealth to good use investing in renewables.  




 And so it begins. If they get away with segregating water for lawns according to elite status, then that will set a precedent for clean drinking water down the road. And don't doubt they will have the same attitude about it.  




 20 years ago if I had seen someone write something like that I would have thought they were mentally disabled. 




 This is some 3rd world bullshit right here. 




 I never turn the new art on- can't stand it. My once smooth and lithe F-NE [runs like an NFL linebacker hitting the field before the big game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgLkF4ROJ_o) instead of the [catlike forest creature](https://youtu.be/S0dgNPrcebM?t=6s) she has been for 10 yrs.

And her face..once pointed and elfin now looks square and mannish.

I don't even want to talk about the new art gnome. My once calm, tranquil 10 yr old veteran mage looks like she has a case of the perm-crazies. 

Just sickening. 




 Women take a mixture of male and female hormones in birth control every month and female-to-male trans take male hormones. It's perfectly legal with a prescription as far as I know.

What's felonious about it? Bit confused here. 




 Even the gear. My NE, Gnome and Drae are not happy wearing what looks like handmedown orc stuff that has been dragged through the mud. 




 She looks very Russian. That's how. 




 My Apache friend complimented me once for "living on Indian Time."

I think it was a compliment.

I never wear a watch. Ever.  




 Seen Ali Baba lately?

 









 I like the re-designs, barring just a few (Cadillac?) Just need to know how Microsoft, bing and Yahoo still look so .. old. 




 The last sentence you posted was something that was considered as a side effect of climate change. 

I know the west coast has been losing animals in insane numbers.

  Oak Island Mayor Betty Wallace told CNN that the female swimmer was attacked first, around 4:15 p.m. Less than 90 minutes later, as responders were still tending to her, the boy was then attacked.

They left the beach open? Florida beaches close at just the sighting of a shark- let alone an attack. What kind of insanity is this? 




 They need sued to the ground for leaving the beach open after the first attack.

 I came on here to say just this. As a child of the 60's I don't recall seeing most of these clothes from the 70's outside of some patterns and some store mannequins. 









 I told my kids to engrave that on my Urn. 




 Thank you for this small ray of sanity.

 Ya forgot yer damn bell, man. 




 This happened to a friend of mine in a not-good area of the city I used to live in. The guy had a knife and was going to stab him - my friend just sucker punched the guy then grabbed him by his shoulders to throw him on the ground and ended up spinning him in a circle - and out into the street. The guy ended up in front of a truck.
