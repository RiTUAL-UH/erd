On June 6, 1991, plaintiff sued defendant, a brewer and seller of beer and malt liquor, claiming that defendant had violated the provisions of the PAA by placing before the public advertisements for its products that contain "statements and/or representations which are untrue, deceptive and/or misleading." As a result, plaintiff claimed, he and the general public had been led to consume defendant's products, which defendant knew were dangerous and likely to cause serious health problems, including addiction and death. In support of his claims, plaintiff pointed to defendant's television advertisements featuring Bud Light as the source of fantasies coming to life, fantasies involving tropical settings, and beautiful women and men engaged in unrestricted merriment. Plaintiff sought monetary damages in excess of $10,000, alleging that defendant's misleading advertisements had caused him physical and mental injury, emotional distress, and financial loss.
Defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing among other things that it had no duty to warn of commonly known dangers. The trial court agreed with defendant's analysis in this regard, and granted summary disposition in its favor. We agree and affirm.

 Last July  I read a story about an 8-year-old girl, Abby Enck, who, in the most genuine of ways, came up with a plan to share her love of coloring. I encourage you to read more about Abby in the link provided, but in a nutshell  shes one of the most inspirational people I have come across. Abbys younger brother Cameron was born with Cerebral Palsy and she would regularly accompany him to Lutheran General Hospital on his medical visits. Abby noticed that the other pediatric patients liked to color, but many of the crayons were broken. Abby had purchased some crayons with her parents for the patients, but it didnt end there. For Abby, it was the obvious thing to do  think up a way to raise money so that she can buy crayons and other coloring materials for the patients.
Abby conducted a lemonade sale. Soon the 8-year-old came up with a plan to raise money by creating lemonade kits using bottled water with attached packets and tags with her very own message, When life gives you lemons, color!. She gained the help of family and friends and before she knew it she was on her way to a goal of purchasing 1000 boxes for the children at the hospital.

 As someone who frequently gets stopped while walking because "someone" reported some minor unprovable crime or "suspicious activity" I have my doubts in this case. It's one of the most common go-to reasons police use for a bullshit stop to provide reasonable suspicion. 

Why would you doubt someone calling about you?

It's one of the most common go-to reasons police use for a bullshit stop to provide reasonable suspicion.

considering how often police have been proven to lie lately

You need to step away from the media machine.  Take into consideration the number of police officers there are in this country, the number of interactions each may have every single day, and then compare to the number of instances that actually get blown up.  Too many people are drinking the media kool-aid. 




  You seem very convinced that this person and their "report" aren't fabricated. 

I'm never 100% convinced of everything unless I know the full details of everything from both sides.  With that said, and from what I've read on this specific instance, there is nothing there to cause me to doubt what happened.  

That is not a reasonable attitude.

Sure it is.  Why?  Because there is nothing there to cause me to doubt it.  What exactly is there about this instance that makes you question the reliability?  Have you wondered at all about the man that was stopped at all and what he was/may have been doing or is the fact that he's not the police officer enough for you to not question his motives?

 




  Spotted by who?

By a person whose yard he was running through.

 Apply that logic to income inequality.

Because that's an entirely different subject.

The wage gap continues to grow and the lower classes do not resort to violence. But because they don't take drastic actions, they don't get results.

Occupy Wall Street certainly didn't do anything.

That's his point, America praises the Boston Tea Party in which America finally revolted and took charge. America fought a violent war to get change from Britain.

The patriots fought for independence, to become their own country.  What exactly are the riots doing and how is it going to change things?

Strictly non-violence is exactly what your opposers want you to use because it doesn't insight enough fear in them

Yet show your full hand right off the bat and it's not going to instill fear either.  Additionally, things like this have been played out before.  Someone fucks up, huge uproar, riots, riots, more riots but not as bad, less riots, and then eventually people go home and do whatever it is they do.

 Is the store in your neighborhood of six houses?  Did you ask all of the neighbors?  If you did, is it not possible that they were lying?  Is it not possible that your son was lying to you?  Was it your neighborhood that someone was seen running through the yards? 




 IF he was actually doing that.

And until anything else comes out this is all we have to go on.  I mean, that's how things roll right?  When a police officer is accused of doing something wrong then in the eyes of the public they are guilty.  Shouldn't it be the same the other way around?  Not like we're talking about an angel of a man here:

*Pusok, 30, has felony and misdemeanor convictions over the last 10 years, including resisting arrest, animal cruelty, grand theft auto and attempted robbery.*  That is from [this](http://www.sbsun.com/general-news/20150424/francis-pusok-questioned-by-sbpd-day-after-650k-settlement-okd) article.

 




 So did you ask everyone in the neighborhood?  Did you personally have eyes on all of the yards at whatever time a call might have come in?  

Did anyone actually see him running though backyards other than a police officer ?

Yeah, the person that called the police.  

There are [other articles](http://www.sbsun.com/general-news/20150424/francis-pusok-questioned-by-sbpd-day-after-650k-settlement-okd) about this online besides the one here that appear to be a little more detailed. 




 Well, show me it's just something the police are saying then.  He wasn't spotted by the police, they were responding to a call from someone else about someone running through the yards. 




 Nobody in the neighborhood had reported any such thing to the police.

Did you ask everybody in the neighborhood?  And if so, and they knew you were asking about your son, do you trust that they'd be honest with you? 




 Francis Pusok, 30, was stopped sometime between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. April 22 in the 3700 block of Elm Avenue after he was spotted running through backyards of homes, 

I would hope a person running through people's backyards at that time in the morning would be stopped to see what they were doing.

The 2009 Pittsburgh police shootings was a shootout that took place on Saturday, April 4, 2009, at 1016 Fairfield Street[1] in the Stanton Heights neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, stemming from a mother and her 22-year-old son's argument over a dog urinating in the house.[2] At approximately 7:11 a.m. EDT, 22-year-old Richard Poplawski opened fire on two Pittsburgh Police officers responding to a 9-1-1 call from Poplawski's mother, who was attempting to get the police officers to remove her son from the home. Three police officers were ultimately confirmed dead, and another two were seriously injured.

According to Pittsburgh Police Chief, Nathan Harper, Poplawski was armed with a semi-automatic AK-47-style rifle, a shotgun and three handguns (a .357 Magnum revolver, a .380-caliber handgun and a .45-caliber handgun), protected by a bulletproof vest, and had been lying in wait for the officers. According to police and witnesses, he held police at bay for four hours as the fallen officers were left bleeding nearby, their colleagues unable to reach them. More than 600 rounds were fired by the SWAT teams and Poplawski.

The victims were the first Pittsburgh city officers killed in the line of duty in 18 years. The incident was the second-deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 attacks, following a shooting two weeks earlier in Oakland, California.
On June 28, 2011, Poplawski was sentenced to death by lethal injection on three counts of murder in the first degree.

 So about those week long peaceful protets that were happening and noone paid any attention or could of gave a fuck. What did those do?

Well, you have [this](http://blackwestchester.com/2015/04/27/10000-peacefully-protest-bmore/):

*What they dont report was there were, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Blacks, Whites, Asians, Young and Old, Rich and Poor people all united and standing harmoniously against common oppression, shared one of the organizers Frank Sha Francois. The demonstration was sponsored by a wide coalition of social justice groups, including Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers For Justice (BLFJ), Carl Dix of Stop Mass Incarceration (SMIN) and brother Ted Freedomfighter Sutton of Sutton House, just to name a few who came in support of their brothers and sisters in Baltimore. Support for justice of Freddie Gray, 25, who was arrested one week ago, in West Baltimore. Who died on April 19th, from injuries sustained while he was in police custody.*

Here's what that does.  It shows a united front of all different types of people.  It shows that people want something done and they are willing to be civilized human beings, sit and discuss the problem, figure out a solution, and fix the problem.


The police are not innocent people

Pretty broad brush stroke there no?  Are there bad cops?  Absolutely.  Are they in the minority.  Yep.  If we want to paint broad brush strokes, would you then agree that "black people are criminals" based on a small percentage that are acting out violently and criminally?

they need to be brought to justice and held accountable

The ones that abuse their power?  Absolutely.

it will not happen thru peaceful means.

Yet it's been proven time and time again that it does.  What do violent/criminal acts do?  They give the city a reason to increase the number of police officers on the street and hire more.  It creates and/or strengthens a stereotype that then turns into bias/profiling.

HAHAH fuck off with the mlk thing

Yeah, because that would go against your agenda and proves you wrong.

 like things havent changed since 9/11 that make peaceful resistance useless

You're right.  Things have changed.  Such as, this country is far less racially divided than it was during the time of MLK.  **HE** was able to bring change, peacefully, in a far more hostile environment.  The environment is nowhere near as hostile today, yet people cannot impact change peacefully?  This just sounds like sheer laziness.

Boohoo other people lives are being disrupted while others fight for their fucking lives

If that's the attitude you want to give, then expect the same attitude in return.  

It's time to stop using the race card and playing victim.  People want to blame others for their situation instead of pulling their own shit together and taking personal responsibility.  You don't want the cops bothering you?  Then don't give them a reason too.  You want to succeed in life?  Then work for it.  Harming other people's lives, ruining their livelihood, creating destruction, and not acting like a civilized human being has never caused progress. 
























 Keep on fighting for your rights and freedoms peoples

Fighting for what rights?  The right to attack innocent people for no reason?  The right to destroy property that doesn't belong to them?  The right to disrupt other people's lives?  The right to steal for their own selfish benefit?

Liu Kang was originally going to be a Japanese character called Minamoto Yoshitsune, but Mortal Kombat co-creator and character designer John Tobias stated that the staff could not "deal with the name." According to Tobias, Liu Kang "was originally going to be a traditional monk  bald and in robes  but he wound up resembling Bruce Lee." As stated on his Mortal Kombat: Armageddon bio card, Ed Boon mentioned that Liu Kang was designed to be the most easily "accessible" character, meaning that both casual and experienced gamers could play as him with little difficulty. According to Tobias, Liu Kang was purposely the only character that voiced his finishing move in the original game, and was "the best" in the first sequel. Liu Kang was the only character in the first game whose finishing move (Fatality) did not explicitly murder his opponent, and also without the background dimming. This was because Liu Kang was depicted therein as a Shaolin monk, who in general have strict beliefs regarding killing and murder. However, starting with Mortal Kombat II, he was given gory Fatalities as he was thereafter depicted as a renegade monk who decided to grow his hair back, and who had "strong Shaolin beliefs, but was no longer a part of the Shaolin monks." In response to rumors that Liu Kang would die in Mortal Kombat II and therefore not make it into Mortal Kombat 3, Boon said, "It'd be like doing part three of Star Wars and not having Luke Skywalker in there. You don't do that." His eventual death caused Dan Forden, the music composer of the series, to make a "funeral song" for Liu Kang as he felt saddened for his death. The track titled "Liu Kang's Tomb" would be used in Mortal Kombat: Deception in the arena that shows his tomb.

After practice, in the locker room, he was told there was a high possibility
he could be a bone marrow match for a complete stranger. Of the 12,000 blood
cancer patients who require marrow, 70 percent do not have matches in their
families.
When I got the phone call, I was so shocked, said Lyle. I totally forgot I
even signed up a couple of years before. Even then, I did not think I would be
a match. The odds are so ridiculous.
After additional testing, Lyle was confirmed as a definite match. There was
no time to waste. The surgery was scheduled immediately for April 25. There
was one catch: the surgery would take place one month before the end of his
college career.
Lyle never feared the actual marrow donation surgery. He worried the most
about telling his coach that he would be sitting out the final part of his
senior season because of the surgery. His coach, though, was supportive. Jim
Boulanger, director of New Hampshires track and field program, told Lyle that
sports do not triumph life, they are merely a part of it. If you have the
chance to save a life, do whatever it takes.
If Lyle chose to be a donor, his collegiate career would stop cold turkey
without the closure a championship win would bring him. As he threw his last
shot at the Stony Brook Invitational on April 20, his teammates surrounded him
to help bring one chapter of his life to a close. For him this was closure.
Hugs were shared and although it was not the ending he planned for, he was
allowing a stranger the chance to start a new chapter of his own.
Even with that elusive conference championship within reach, Lyle never had
any second thoughts about donating  especially when he learned about the man
who would be receiving his marrow donation.
Lyles 28-year-old match was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia a
few days before Christmas in 2012. He had a fianc and a nineteen-month-old
son. For Lyle, this information solidified his decision to donate.
I would have done it anyway, said Lyle. But knowing he is just starting
his life, he has so much ahead of him, makes it worth it. It hits home because
he is only a few years older than I am.

Art's left arm was severely bleeding from what appeared to be surface wounds. The doctors pulled out close to 50 pieces of glass embedded into his skin on his left arm, he said.
He also had four to five broken ribs and his hip severely broken in several places. Art spent eight weeks in a body cast and had a tracheotomy to help him breathe easier.
Because all of the blood was assumed to be from glass cuts and the hip injury was so severe, doctors failed to notice a metal rod  the T-bird's turn signal arm  was embedded in Art's left forearm.
Art and Betty met six months later on a blind date.
Let's fast forward to 15 years ago when Art discovered there was something in his arm because of a metal detector at the courthouse in Jerseyville, Ill.
His doctor checked it out and thought it was from the accident, but no telling exactly what it was.
In fact, the doctor thought it could have been a surgical instrument forgotten and sewed up inside his arm. But, because it didn't bother Art, the doctor said to leave it alone.
In early December, the arm started to pose a problem after Art carried a cement block. After feeling a little pain, days later he started to notice a protrusion. Art was referred to a specialist.
Doctor Lang removed the seven-inch rod on Dec. 31. The procedure lasted 45 minutes.

Asimina triloba, the pawpaw, paw paw, paw-paw, or common pawpaw, is a species of Asimina (the pawpaw genus) in the same plant family (the Annonaceae) as the custard-apple, cherimoya, sweetsop, ylang-ylang and soursop. The pawpaw is native to the Eastern, Southern, and Midwestern United States and adjacent southernmost Ontario, Canada, from New York west to southeastern Nebraska, and south to northern Florida and eastern Texas. The pawpaw is a patch-forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottom-land and hilly upland habitat, with large, simple leaves and large fruits. **The paw paw is the largest edible fruit indigenous to the United States.**

The first lawn mower was invented by Edwin Budding in 1830 in Thrupp, just outside Stroud, in Gloucestershire, England. Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the grass on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and was granted a British patent on August 31, 1830.

Budding's first machine was 19 inches (480 mm) wide with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind. Cast iron gear wheels transmitted power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder, allowing the rear roller to drive the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. Another roller placed between the cutting cylinder and the main or land roller could be raised or lowered to alter the height of cut. The grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray-like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front to help pull the machine along.Overall, these machines were remarkably similar to modern mowers.

New posts were and are being added without being automatically deleted. Ergo, the rule is not being enforced in general.

And what?  You're talking about posts going back **years** yet the rule pertaining to police brutality wasn't in place at that time.  Not a difficult concept to understand why those ones were not removed.

So far, every post added after the rule has not been removed

Yet you weren't even aware of the rule in the first place so how do you know when it was added?  Additionally, it's highly improbable that the mods are going to catch every single post put up on here so I'm not surprised *every* post added hasn't been removed.  With that said, you also have no idea how many have been removed because you can't see them anyway and have no idea what has actually been posted and taken down in totality.

despite all of them being "related" to something in the news in the last 8 years

The rule doesn't talk about *something in the news* in the last 8 years.  It mentions many different aspects within the rule itself that requires only an elementary school level of comprehension.

 if the mods want to delete everything in TIL

I'm pretty sure they want to delete everything in TIL **that doesn't abide by the posted rules.**

In the meantime, the rule is meaningless.

Why is it meaningless?  Because you can't grasp the simplicity of it?

Women have used tampons during menstruation for thousands of years. In her book Everything You Must Know About Tampons (1981), Nancy Friedman writes, "[T]here is evidence of tampon use throughout history in a multitude of cultures. The oldest printed medical document, Papyrus Ebers, refers to the use of soft papyrus tampons by Egyptian women in the fifteenth century B.C. Roman women used wool tampons. Women in ancient Japan fashioned tampons out of paper, held them in place with a bandage, and changed them 10 to 12 times a day. Traditional Hawaiian women used the furry part of a native fern called hapu'u; and grasses, mosses and other plants are still used by women in parts of Asia."

The stereotype of Jews eating Chinese food on Christmas does have an origin. In 1935, the New York Times reported that a restaurant owner named Eng Shee Chuck had brought chow mein to a Jewish childrens home in Newark on Christmas Day. This article is considered to be one of the earliest publications of the stereotype that relates Jews to Chinese food on Christmas.

The relationship that Jews have to Chinese food certainly goes deeper than this stereotype. Eating Chinese [food] has become a meaningful symbol of American Judaism For in eating Chinese, the Jews found a modern means of expressing their traditional cultural values. The savoring of Chinese food is now a ritualized celebration of immigration, education, family, community, and continuity. Chinese food is considered a staple in the Jewish culture, and the further option of kosher Chinese food is also becoming more and more available in the US.

In Berlin in 1931, Dora R, born as Rudolph R, became the first known transgender woman to undergo the vaginoplasty surgical approach.

This was followed by Lili Elbe in Berlin during 1930-1931. She started with the removal of the male sex organs, the operation supervised by Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. Lili went on to have four more subsequent operations that included an unsuccessful uterine transplant, the rejection of which resulted in death. An earlier known recipient of this was Magnus Hirschfeld's housekeeper, but their identity is unclear at this time.

The Iranian government's response to homosexuality is to endorse, and fully pay for, sex reassignment surgery. The leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa declaring sex reassignment surgery permissible for "diagnosed transsexuals." Eshaghian's documentary, Be Like Others, chronicles a number of stories of Iranian gay men who feel transitioning is the only way to avoid further persecution, jail and/or execution. The head of Iran's main transsexual organization, Maryam Khatoon Molkarawho convinced Khomeini to issue the fatwa on transsexualityconfirmed that some people who undergo operations are gay rather than transsexual.

**Thailand is the country that performs the most sex reassignment surgeries, followed by Iran.**

On 12 June 2003, European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of Van Kck, a German transsexual woman whose insurance company denied her reimbursement for sex reassignment surgery as well as hormone replacement therapy. The legal arguments related to the Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the Article 8. This affair is referred to as Van Kck vs Germany.

The Three Sisters are three rocky islands in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., west of the Key Bridge. A notable landmark in colonial times, the islets are less well known as the Three Sisters Islands and Three Sisters Island.

Various legends are associated with the Three Sisters. One of the earliest myths involves three Algonquian sisters who crossed the river in an attempt to win the release of their brothers, who had been kidnapped by another tribe. They drowned while crossing the river, and were turned into the rocky islets. A less commonly cited legend says three daughters of the local Native American chief were marooned on the islands by their father after rejecting the husbands he picked out for them. The legend holds that the sisters cursed the spot, saying that if they could not cross the Potomac there, no one could. A strange moaning or bell-like sound is said to come from the Potomac River when the curse is about to claim another life.

The first European to see the Three Sisters was Captain John Smith, who sailed up the Potomac River and saw them in 1607. The islets were a landmark in colonial times, and appeared on Pierre L'Enfant's first map of the area.

General Order No. 11 was the title of an order issued by Major-General Ulysses S. Grant on December 17, 1862, during the American Civil War. It ordered the expulsion of all Jews in his military district, comprising areas of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky. The order was issued as part of a Union campaign against a black market in Southern cotton, which Grant thought was being run "mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders." In the war-zone, the United States licensed traders through the United States Army, which created a market for unlicensed ones. Union military commanders in the South were responsible for administering the trade licenses and trying to control the black market in Southern cotton, as well as for conducting the war. Grant issued the order in an effort to reduce corruption.

Following protests from Jewish community leaders and an outcry by members of Congress and the press, at President Abraham Lincoln's insistence, the General Order was revoked weeks later on January 17, 1863. During his campaign for the presidency in 1868, Grant repudiated the order, saying that it had been drafted by a subordinate and that he had signed it without reading it during warfare.

It was legalized by royal decree in 1751, in part due to George Whitefield's support for the institution of slavery.

Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. However, they were not told (and the consent form contained no information indicating) that the food their children were fed contained radioactive calcium and iron. The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign. The company was later sued because of the experiments.

Nearby buildings totaling 37,000 square feet (3,400 m2), were purchased by PNC and deconstructed to make space for the Tower at PNC Plaza.The project was estimated to cost $400 million when announced in 2011 (or $419 million today). Construction started in spring of 2012 and is planned to be completed in September 2015. The tower will be the greenest Skyrise ever built and will exceed the current criteria for a LEED Platinum certified building. The Tower will feature numerous sustainable attributes such as an operable double skin facade, an onsite blue water reuse system, locally sourced building materials, fixtures and furniture made from recycled materials, and numerous other green strategies to substantially reduce the environmental impact of the building. Some of these features will enable the Tower's heating and cooling systems to operate in a "net-zero-energy state" up to 30% of the year.

After attempting to develop his own version of the proposed show called House of Mystery, Joseph Barbera, who handled the development and sale of Hanna-Barbera shows while William Hanna handled production, passed the task along to story writers Joe Ruby   Ken Spears and artist/character designer Iwao Takamoto. Their original treatment, based in part on The Archie Show, was titled Mysteries Five, and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, Linda's brother "W.W." and their dog, Too Much, who were all members of the band "Mysteries Five," including the dog who played bongos. When "The Mysteries Five" were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty dog. When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a Great Dane, but revised the dog character to a large sheepdog (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, Hot Dog) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke. Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.

George Washington's will directed the building of the present vault in the following words: "The family Vault at Mount Vernon requiring repairs, and being improperly situated besides, I desire that a new one of Brick, and upon a larger Scale, may be built at the foot of what is commonly called the Vineyard Inclosure. . . In which my remains, with those of my deceased relatives (now in the old Vault) and such others of my family as may chuse to be entombed there, may be deposited."

Immediately after Washington's death, Congress resolved that a marble monument should be erected to his memory in the new Capitol in the city of Washington, and that his family should be requested to permit his body to be deposited beneath it. Martha Washington's consent was solicited and obtained. A crypt was provided under the dome of the Capitol, but the project was never completed. In 1831, the surviving executors of Washington's estate removed the bodies of George and Martha Washington and those of other members of the family from the old vault to a similar structure within the present enclosure at Mount Vernon.

 









 Where in your source does it say that?  This is a clear violation of rule one.  This is what I found in your source...........which I was able to get to after having to verify my age and search through a table of contents.

This is what I found:

*How is the alcohol content in beer measured?*

*Alcohol content in beer is typically measured in one of two ways: by volume (which is most common) or by weight. Using Coors as an example: A 12-ounce serving contains 5.0 percent alcohol by volume which means that of all the liquid in the container, 5.0 percent of the liquid is alcohol. The same 12-oz. serving of Coors Light is about 4.0 percent alcohol by weight, which means that of the total weight of the liquid in the container, 4.0 percent of the weight is contributed by the alcohol.*

*Sounds simple, but if we're talking about the exact same serving of beer, why the difference between volume and weight measurements? That's because a given volume of alcohol weighs less than the same volume of water. (An ethyl alcohol molecule, or C2H5OH, is larger than a molecule of water, or H2O, and takes up more space.) So whatever the serving size, the alcohol weight percentage will always be smaller than the volume percentage. This basic fact should help dispel any myth about 3.2 beers or so-called "near-beers" allegedly containing much less alcohol compared to regular beers. The "3.2" in 3.2 beers represents the percentage of alcohol by weight, which means that there's about 4 percent alcohol by volume in the beer. Anyone who believes that he or she cannot become intoxicated consuming 3.2 beer is just plain wrong. If you know of anyone who's a believer in the 3.2 beer "myth," do him or her a favor and share the facts.*

 When you have one of the agencies coming out and saying that the Patriot Act did nothing, then why does this "need" to get done?  Because of something that **might** happen?  If that's the case, let's make it rain in new laws because of something that **might** happen.   




 In pretty much every country on earth blocking traffic is par for the course in protests. And it is usually the most effective tactic.

Effective in doing what?  Getting results?  If that's what you're implying, I'd love to see some evidence to support that blocking traffic is the most effective in getting results.

 Yet, while there is in fact no way to prove this, I doubt Iraq would be in this current situation (at least at this level) if we hadn't gone in on false information, obliterated their infrastructure, and made promises that we never kept.  We'd also still have thousands of U.S. military/civilian personnel among us as well. 

So while there is always this talk about who won the war/lost the war, it never should have happened in the first place.  There has to be a cause to create the effect. 









 Anytime I now see a bill with a name like this, I immediately assume it's full of some high level of crap.  How many people actually read the bills as opposed to just reading the title?  My guess is more go for the title, see something like "The Patriot Act," and then go all "Yeah! 'Murica!" And turn into a redneck sounding hick.

Thomas Harris has given few interviews, and did not explain where he got inspiration for Hannibal Lecter until mid 2013. Harris revealed that the character was inspired by a real-life Mexican doctor and murderer he met while visiting a prison in Monterrey city, in the state of Nuevo Len, during a trip to Mexico in the 1960s, when he was a 23-year-old reporter. The doctor was serving a life sentence for murdering a young man, supposedly a "close friend", mutilating his body into several body parts and putting them in a very small box. Harris, who would only refer to the surgeon by the fake name "Dr. Salazar", described him as a "small lithe pale man with dark red hair". He added: "There was certain intelligence and elegance about him." Harris had gone to Mxico to interview Dykes Askew Simmons, a US citizen on death row for murdering three young people in the country, but he ended up also speaking to "Salazar", who saved Simmons' life after a guard shot him during an escape bid. "Salazar" revealed his dark side as he began discussing Simmons disfigured face, tormented upbringing and how attractive his victims had been.

The Quintinshill rail disaster occurred on 22 May 1915 near Gretna Green, Dumfriesshire, Scotland at Quintinshill, an intermediate signal box with passing loops on each side on the Caledonian Railway Main Line linking Glasgow and Carlisle (now part of the West Coast Main Line).

The crash, which involved five trains, killed a probable 226[nb 1] and injured 246 and remains the worst rail crash in the United Kingdom in terms of loss of life. Those killed were mainly Territorial soldiers from the 1/7th (Leith) Battalion, the Royal Scots heading for Gallipoli. The precise death toll was never established with confidence as the roll list of the regiment was destroyed by the fire.

The crash occurred when a troop train travelling from Larbert, Stirlingshire to Liverpool, Lancashire collided with a local passenger train that had been shunted on to the main line, to then be hit by an express train to Glasgow which crashed into the wreckage a minute later. Gas from the lighting system of the old wooden carriages of the troop train ignited, starting a fire which soon engulfed the three passenger trains and also two goods trains standing on nearby passing loops. Some bodies were never recovered, having been wholly consumed by the fire, and the bodies that were recovered were buried together in a mass grave in Edinburgh's Rosebank Cemetery. Four bodies, believed to be of children, were never identified or claimed and are buried in the Western Necropolis, Glasgow.

The cause of the accident was neglect of the rules by two signalmen. Both men were charged with manslaughter in England, then convicted of culpable homicide after trial in Scotland; the two terms are broadly equivalent. After they were released from a Scottish jail in 1916, they were re-employed by the railway company, although not as signalmen.

A memorial to the dead soldiers was erected soon after the accident and there are more recent memorials at various locations. An annual remembrance service is held at Rosebank Cemetery.

In China, during the Tang Dynasty (618907), paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of tea.

The first tea bags were hand-sewn fabric bags; tea bag patents date as early as 1903. First appearing commercially around 1904, tea bags were successfully marketed by the tea and coffee shop merchant Thomas Sullivan from New York, who shipped his tea bags around the world. The loose tea was intended to be removed from the sample bags by customers, but they found it easier to brew the tea with the tea still enclosed in the porous bags. Modern tea bags are usually made of paper fibre. The heat-sealed paper fiber tea bag was invented by William Hermanson, one of the founders of Technical Papers Corporation of Boston. Hermanson sold his patent to the Salada Tea Company in 1930.

**The rectangular tea bag was not invented until 1944. Prior to this, tea bags resembled small sacks.**

Hagfish, the class Myxini (also known as Hyperotreti), are eel-shaped, slime-producing marine fish (occasionally called slime eels). They are the only known living animals that have a skull but no vertebral column. Along with lampreys, hagfish are jawless and are living fossils; they are basal to vertebrates, and living hagfish remain similar to hagfish from around 300 million years ago.

The classification of hagfish has been controversial. The issue is whether the hagfish is itself a degenerate type of vertebrate-fish (most closely related to lampreys), or else may represent a stage which precedes the evolution of the vertebral column (as do lancelets). The original scheme groups hagfish and lampreys together as cyclostomes (or historically, Agnatha), as the oldest surviving class of vertebrates alongside gnathostomes (the now-ubiquitous jawed vertebrates). An alternative scheme proposed that jawed vertebrates are more closely related to lampreys than to hagfish (i.e., that vertebrates include lampreys but exclude hagfish), and introduces the category craniata to group vertebrates near hagfish. Recent DNA evidence has supported the original scheme.

The Mara Salvatrucha gang originated in Los Angeles, set up in the 1980s by Salvadoran immigrants in the city's Pico-Union neighborhood who immigrated to the United States after the Central American civil wars of the 1980s.

Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans and African-Americans.

Many Mara Salvatrucha gang members from the Los Angeles area have been deported after being arrested. Namely, Jose Abrego, a high-ranking member, was deported four times. As a result of these deportations, members of MS have recruited more members in their home countries. The Los Angeles Times contends that deportation policies have contributed to the size and influence of the gang both in the United States and in Central America. According to the 2009 National Gang Threat Assessment, "The gang is estimated to have 30,000 to 50,000 members and associate members worldwide, 8,000 to 10,000 of whom reside in the United States."

In recent years the gang has expanded into the Washington, D.C. area, in particular the areas of Langley Park and Takoma Park, Maryland, have become centers of MS gang activity.

Track 61 is a private railway platform for the Metro-North Railroad in New York City, located beneath the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel and just outside of Grand Central Terminal. The platform is part of the Grand Central Terminal complex.

First used by General John J.

The track was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946; in 1948 Filene's and the New Haven Railroad staged a fashion show on the platform. As of May 1, 2014, it has been reported to still be in occasional use.

Despite being contradicted by other studies like those of George Darwin and Alan Huth in England and Robert Newman in New York, the report's conclusions were widely accepted.

Sedgwick fell at the beginning of the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, on May 9, 1864. His corps was probing skirmish lines ahead of the left flank of Confederate defenses and he was directing artillery placements. Confederate sharpshooters were about 1,000 yards (900 m) away and their shots caused members of his staff and artillerymen to duck for cover. Sedgwick strode around in the open and was quoted as saying, "What? Men dodging this way for single bullets? What will you do when they open fire along the whole line?" Although ashamed, his men continued to flinch and he said, "Why are you dodging like this? They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance." Reports that he never finished the sentence are apocryphal, although the line was among his last words.[5] He was shot moments later under the left eye and fell down dead.

Sedgwick was the highest ranking Union casualty in the Civil War. Although James B. McPherson was in command of an army at the time of his death and Sedgwick of a corps, Sedgwick had the most senior rank by date of all major generals killed. Upon hearing of his death, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, flabbergasted by the news, repeatedly asked, "Is he really dead?"

Many are constructed with the embedded steel reinforcement protruding from each end, allowing them to be incorporated into permanent emplacements when linked to one another by sections of fresh concrete poured on-site.The U.S. military nicknamed the devices as "Qaddafi Blocks" after truck bomb attacks in Beirut in 1983 resulted in more widespread use in military installations.

Female spotted hyenas have a clitoris 90 percent as long and the same diameter as a male penis (171 millimeters long and 22 millimeters in diameter), and this pseudo-penis's formation seems largely androgen-independent because it appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. The spotted hyenas have a highly erectile clitoris, complete with a false scrotum, and "the resemblance to male genitalia is so close that sex can be determined with confidence only by palpation of the scrotum". The pseudo-penis can also be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. The female possesses no external vagina, as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. In the females, this scrotum consists of soft adipose tissue. Like male spotted hyenas with regard to their penises, the female spotted hyenas have small penile spines "on the glans, or head, of [their clitorises], making the clitoris tip feel like soft sandpaper". The clitoris "extends away from the body in a sleek and slender arc, measuring, on average, over 17 cm from root to tip. Just like a penis, [it] is fully erectile, raising its head in hyena greeting ceremonies, social displays, games of rough and tumble or when sniffing out peers".

Pharmacist Charles Elmer Hires was the first to successfully market a commercial brand of root beer. Hires discovered his root tea made from sassafras in 1875, debuted a commercial version of root beer at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876, and began selling his extract. Hires was a teetotaler who wanted to call the beverage "root tea". However, his desire to market the product to Pennsylvania coal miners caused him to call his product "root beer" instead. In 1886, Hires began to bottle a beverage made from his famous extract. By 1893, root beer was distributed widely across the United States. Non-alcoholic versions of root beer became commercially successful, especially during Prohibition.

By 1012 million years ago, the hyena family had split into two distinct groups; that of the dog-like hyenas and the bone-crushing hyenas. The arrival of the ancestral bone-crushing hyenas coincided with the decline of the similarly built but unrelated Percrocutidae family. The bone-crushing hyenas survived the devastating changes in climate and the arrival of canids, which wiped out the dog-like hyenas, though they never crossed into North America, as their niche there had already been taken by the Borophaginae family. By 5 million years ago, the bone-crushing hyenas became the dominant scavengers of Eurasia, primarily feeding on large herbivore carcasses felled by sabre-toothed cats. One genus, Pachycrocuta, was a 200 kg (440 lb) mega-scavenger that could splinter the bones of elephants. With the decline of large herbivores by the late ice age, Pachycrocuta was replaced by the smaller Crocuta.

James Earl Jones was born in Arkabutla, Mississippi on January 17, 1931, son of Robert Earl Jones (19102006), an actor, boxer, butler, and chauffeur who left the family shortly after James Earl's birth, and his wife Ruth (Connolly) Jones, a teacher and maid. Jones and his father reconciled many years later. Jones was raised by his maternal grandparents, farmers John Henry and Maggie Connolly. His parents were both African-American, and he has said that he also has Irish and Native American ancestry.

Jones has described his grandmother, Maggie, as "the most racist person I have ever known", thus forcing him to develop his own independent thinking. His grandmother was of Cherokee, Choctaw, and black ancestry.

He moved to his grandparents' farm in Jackson, Michigan, when he was five, but the transition was traumatic and he developed a stutter so severe he refused to speak. When he moved to Brethren, Michigan, in later years, a teacher at the Brethren schools helped him overcome his stutter. He remained functionally mute for eight years, until he entered high school. He credits his English teacher, Donald Crouch, who discovered he had a gift for writing poetry, with helping him end his silence. Crouch believed forced public speaking would help Jones gain confidence and insisted he recite a poem in class every day. "I was a stutterer. I couldn't talk. So my first year of school was my first mute year, and then those mute years continued until I got to high school."

Prosecutors said Petric planned to kill his parents because he was angry that his father would not allow him to play the video game "Halo 3," in which players shoot alien monsters that have taken over the Earth.

During the trial, deputy prosecuting attorney Anthony Cillo described Petric as a cold, calculating killer who plotted to murder his parents, Mark and Susan Petric, and make it appear to be a murder-suicide by putting the gun in his father's hand.

Defense Attorney James Kersey has said that Petric was obsessed with the "Halo" series of video games, which he played 18 hours a day when he had the chance. Petric used his father's key to open a lockbox and remove a 9 mm handgun and the game.

Mark Petric, who is a minister at New Life Assembly of God in Wellington, testified that his son came into the room and asked: "Would you guys close your eyes? I have a surprise for you."

The father testified that he expected a pleasant surprise. Then his head went numb from a gunshot and he survived. His wife, Susan, 43, died of gunshot wound to the head.

Kersey said during the trial that when the teenager fled the grisly scene, he only took one item with him: the "Halo 3" game.

Because it gives fuller context to the quote, as well as highlights what site is reporting on the article so you can immediately notate the likelihood of bias. Additionally, merely because people may have said something, does not mean they witnessed it firsthand. They may be repeating something that an unknown person told them or have heard about elsewhere potentially making the information circular anyway and ultimately all from one source.

Quotes like these are easily verified.

Here's the thing.  How do you know they are truly credible?  Because someone threw it up on the internet and said they were?  What you did is you searched "credible" and looked for things that supported your already held ideas.  Ever seen [this](http://www.challengefuture.org/static/upload/uploads/abe-lincoln.jpg)?  There is a reason that was made.  Because too many people believe what they find on the internet to be true just because it's on the internet.

I don't recall calling you "nuts" but when someone wants to be a jackass and make statements like:

 The only issue with that line of thinking is that the police don't know your intent.  For all they know, you're waiting to get to an area more "friendly" for you. 




 It's not like we can change the laws...

This is a line of crap right here and an example of the attitude as to why laws won't change, because people accept defeat without even trying.  If you want laws to change, it can be done but time, work, and effort need to be put into it.  Hell, look at where things are moving with cannabis.  Change can happen.

What if the crimes are victimless and the laws are unjust? 

Prove to a solid majority of people in your area with unbiased information that supports your point that the crimes are victimless or laws unjust.  Simply saying it doesn't make it so.  It just sounds like one person stating an opinion.

Like selling cannabis or sex? 

I personally believe, and this is only my opinion, that there are more crimes and "victims" with these two items being illegal in most places.  The only reason I can figure why they haven't been legalized is because the people in office haven't yet figured out how to make more money off of them with them being legal yet. 




 Which is not relevant at all.  Police don't make people commit crime.  The people who commit crimes do that on their own.  If they chose to stop committing crimes, the need for police would drop.

Two studies published in 2013 and 2014 have found that people who are identified as trolls tend to have dark personality traits and show signs of sadism, antisocial behavior, psychopathy, and machiavellianism. The 2013 study suggested that there are a number of similarities between anti-social and flame trolling activities and the 2014 study suggested that the noxious personality characteristics known as the "dark triad of personality" should be investigated in the analysis of trolling, and concluded that trolling appears "to be an Internet manifestation of everyday sadism." Their relevance is suggested by research linking these traits to bullying in both adolescents and adults. The 2014 study found that trolls operate as agents of chaos on the Internet, exploiting hot-button issues to make users appear overly emotional or foolish in some manner. If an unfortunate person falls into their trap, trolling intensies for further, merciless amusement. This is why novice Internet users are routinely admonished, "Do not feed the trolls!" The 2013 study found that trolls often have a high expectation of what it means to be successful, which is higher than they are able to attain, and this results in them resenting others who think they are successful but who fall below their standards.

In 1791, partly as a result of the Copper Panic of 1789, Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits, which led to protests in frontier districts, especially Pennsylvania. By 1794, after Washington ordered the protesters to appear in U.S. district court, the protests turned into full-scale defiance of federal authority known as the Whiskey Rebellion. The federal army was too small to be used, so Washington invoked the Militia Act of 1792 to summon militias from Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey. The governors sent the troops with Washington taking initial command. He then subsequently named Henry "Lighthorse Harry" Lee as field commander of the troops being marched into the rebellious districts. The rebels dispersed and there was no fighting, as Washington's forceful action proved the new government could protect itself. These events marked the first time under the new constitution that the federal government used strong military force to exert authority over the states and citizens and is also the only time a sitting U.S. president personally commanded troops in the field.

The term dog has been used as a synonym for sausage since 1884 and accusations that sausage makers used dog meat date to at least 1845. In the early 20th century, consumption of dog meat in Germany was common. The suspicion that sausages contained dog meat was "occasionally justified".

Raccoons can carry rabies, a lethal disease caused by the neurotropic rabies virus carried in the saliva and transmitted by bites. Its spread began in Florida and Georgia in the 1950s and was facilitated by the introduction of infected individuals to Virginia and North Dakota in the late 1970s. Of the 6,940 documented rabies cases reported in the United States in 2006, 2,615 (37.7%) were in raccoons. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as local authorities in several U.S. states and Canadian provinces, has developed oral vaccination programs to fight the spread of the disease in endangered populations. Only one human fatality has been reported after transmission of the rabies virus strain commonly known as "raccoon rabies". Among the main symptoms for rabies in raccoons are a generally sickly appearance, impaired mobility, abnormal vocalization, and aggressiveness. There may be no visible signs at all, however, and most individuals do not show the aggressive behavior seen in infected canids; rabid raccoons will often retire to their dens instead. Organizations like the U.S. Forest Service encourage people to stay away from animals with unusual behavior or appearance, and to notify the proper authorities, such as an animal control officer from the local health department. Since healthy animals, especially nursing mothers, will occasionally forage during the day, daylight activity is not a reliable indicator of illness in raccoons.

And it didn't say this at all.  So, again, source?

Ah, so it **STARTS** during the fight?  And doesn't show what actually happened prior to the recording starting?

Every person said the lady started it. 

Surely you have a source for *every* person stating this.

The "statement I can't back up" is the word of every fucking person there.

*Every*?  Surely you have a source to support what *every* person there said?

I'm not doing your homework just try reading a paragraph or two from a news report or two.

there's actually video evidence that it was a neighbourhood lady coming over to fight with the kids

First, where is the video for this?  Secondly, what were the actions going on before the video started?

 Abortions have declined in states where new laws make it harder to have them

 Is this CEO of reddit effectively calling all 150000+ users of FPH "idiots from that toxic shithole" ?

 Yes, if it is shown in court he is real and has potential to cause harm to property.

So what you're saying is that we don't really know if this guy is legit or has the potential to cause harm to property?  

And are you also saying that a seller should be required to tell a potential buyer about **possible** things that could happen to the property from outside forces?  Give me a break pal, you're grasping at straws at this point.

First you say it's required for the people to report it to a buyer but you can't support that with factual evidence.  Second, you want to fall back on 'the courts have made exceptions before,' which still doesn't show how this would have been required.  Third, you're not even reading what the hell they mean when they use the terms "material" and "property" but instead think your own personal opinion on what it should mean is the true definition. Fourth, you think people should be required to report things that **MIGHT** happen to the property in the future from outside forces?  Really?! 




 Materials can be any relevant information that can be deemed hazaroudous to a potential buyer.

About the house and property.  You have yet to show how this person is an actual, physical, legal component of the house and/or property.

Murder/suicides are not relevant

Ones that occurred in the actual house/property apparently were.  Lightning has the capacity to cause damage to the house.  Should the seller be required to tell the buyer that too? 









 material facts or who hide information about their property

Exactly.  **Material** facts about the **property**.  He is not part of the property.  The house and land is the property.

Hell, NJ courts decided that even previous murders/suicides in the house don't need to be disclosed.  UNLESS the potential buyers specifically ask about it.  In which case the seller would then need to disclose it.

Here's the [NJ Seller's Disclosure Agreement](http://www.marybajwa.com/IS2/Data/AgentSites/64976/property%20disclosure.pdf). 




 he can affect potential resale of the property... thats enough

Possibly.  However he does not fall under the requirement of needing to be disclosed.  Unless the buyers specifically asked about a problem that he would fall under, the sellers were not required to tell them. 




 If the former owners daughter is afraid of a ghost in the house, and its anything from a squeaky floorboard to literally nothing, 

The squeaky floorboard is the only thing that would need to be disclosed as it's an actual defect to the property.  "Hauntings", past murders in the house, or past suicides in the house are not disclosure requirements in NJ unless the potential buyer asks about it.

the realtor is required by law to disclose.

And what New Jersey law requires them to disclose an annoying person who is not part of the property?  Hell, you're not required to disclose a murder or suicide that happened in a house in NJ unless the potential buyer specifically asks about it.

I'm pretty sure the only thing they actually can't disclose is the racial makeup of your neighborhood. 

Homeowners can disclose whatever they want.  There are certain things that they are required to disclose about the property and they are required to also disclose things that the buyers ask about.  That's it.

If the HOUSE is being harassed,you can bet that falls under duty to disclose.

Source? 




  It requires disclosure.

No it doesn't.  Show me the law in New Jersey that requires this.  

 




 Not the same principle.  The chemicals in the soil at the house I would have just sold you are and actual part of the house/property that I am selling you.  The bozo is not a part of the house/property. 









 That's along the lines of what I was thinking.  Anything pertaining to the property?  Yes, absolutely that needs to be disclosed.  The bozo isn't part of the property being sold. 




 I would imagine they are under no obligation to disclose that.  But that's just me.  Like you said, it's a gray area. 




 What are they suing for?  The previous owners were selling the house.  The buyers bought the house.  Are homeowners supposed to provide crime stats and profiles of all people in the neighborhood now?

Still waiting for you to show me his **goal** was positive tension.

The man's legacy has been whitewashed. He might have been a pacifist, but he was also no pushover who went around demonizing rioters like so many conservative pundits keep assuming he did. You can go on google and find plenty of quotes from him (especially towards the end of his life) defending the actions of looters during the detroit riots or property destruction.

He was a christian and thought being non-violent was gods way. But that doesn't mean he lacked understanding.

I might add that MLK was far from some sort of holy prophet who's alter we must bow before. 

Yet, you want to quote MLK yourself.  Amazing how you dismiss something he said when it doesn't fit your ideals.

Nobody ever gained liberation by asking politely. Nobody. There is no dialogue, because at the end of the day the powerful have no reason to listen. The oppressed are not meant to grovel before their oppressors for freedom, because they won't get it.

Oh... FYI, The SC Legislature just agreed to take up a debate on the subject of removing the Confederate Flag from the Statehouse grounds.

Yes.  I know.  That story has already been posted a few times now in /r/news and I already commented on it.  At the outset, I think it's a joke to have a vote to discuss something to then have another vote.  Just do it already.  However, this is a symbolic vote in my opinion and once things cool down after a few weeks, I don't believe it'll change.  It's the typical politician "kick the can down the road until people forget and we can move on" ploy that we see all the time as it is. 




 California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation on Thursday prohibiting selling or displaying items bearing the Confederate flag.

Not sure if you purposely left out some essential information or not but in case you didn't:

Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation last year **prohibiting state agencies** from selling or displaying items bearing the flag

So where exactly is the First Amendment being encroached upon? 




 Trying to change the subject once again? 

No.  Asking you to respond to a question I've now asked three times.   




 The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, impeding the free exercise of religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances.

Right.  And where exactly is any of this happening? 




 Are you going to answer the question I directly asked you twice already?

Here, in case you forgot.  

**Do you also support banning the U.S. flag? If no, why?** 




  I do not agree with banning the flag but you really need to read and understand what the First Amendment actually means. 




 Why imagine? Ask them. I would imagine that if it upset me that much, I'd move elsewhere to any of the other states in the country that don't have the flag and not stay there.

However, at least recently, when issues arise I see pictures and videos of black people burning not the Confederate flag, but the U.S. flag.  As I previously stated, the KKK flies the U.S. flag at rallies.  Such as [here](http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/75967545_copjvo8a.jpg), [here](http://www.authentichistory.com/1921-1929/4-resistance/2-KKK/19250809_Klan_March_on_Washington_version3-Capitol_Steps.jpg), [here](http://www.rulen.com/kkk/kkkflag3.jpg), and [here in this flyer/poster/whatever it is.](http://pictures.ozy.com/pictures/450xany/8/7/9/70879_42-15780039.jpg).

And let's not forget our slave-owning forefathers as well.

Do you also support banning the U.S. flag?  If no, why? 




 I've considered the reality that this flag is all over the place and the solid majority don't go randomly shooting people because of it.  However, one person does it and it gets banned?  Really?  

Why not ban the U.S. flag while we're at it?  The KKK, who have hung blacks, typically wave the U.S. flag around.  Let's ban the Bible.  People who attack/bomb abortion clinics are doing it because of what they perceive the Bible to say.  

To blame this on a flag is outrageously simplistic and characteristic of those who don't want to work to figure out the real problem. 




 I doubt the removal will happen.  All of this crap is going on right now because it's the shiny new object.  Give it a few weeks and everyone will forget about it. 




 Would all this flag drama be going on if the shooting happened in a different state?  It amazes me that suddenly everyone gives a damn about..........a flag.  All this does is give that symbol more power than it had before.

Then again, this is the kind of crap this country does when things go wrong.  Focus on the non-issue and ignore the real issue. 




 I find the government having to take a vote to discuss something before taking another vote more infuriating than a flag. 



















 And why is this news?

Probably the same reason you posted an article to /r/news about the [Attorney General meeting Gray's family](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/34z2zz/attorney_general_loretta_lynch_meets_freddie/). 









 because all conversation in the comments MUST follow the topic of the title. There CANNOT be any side discussion. 

Yet you're getting spun up claiming that **I** derailed the topic.  Now you're defending it.  Make up your mind pal.

Two or three news stations running a story EQUALS the whole country being thoroughly informed.

Two or three news stations cancels out your claims that the media made no peep of it.  Additionally, if you think those few, to include the #1 circulated newspaper in the country were the only ones, you're deluding yourself.  As I previously stated, I grabbed the first five I saw on the first page of a Google search.

Anyone that had 5 Hour Energy in the last 5 years and never heard of this should feel quite betrayed, by the media, stores, and FDA;

Uh, yeah, OK.  Oversensitive much?

fuck off troll

What?  No facts to support your claims?  Eh, I guess when not only I, but you yourself show your claims to be B.S., I guess this is what you resort too.  Toodles. 




 For fuck's sake all this time I've been talking about the crime not the indictments!!!

Then, when the title of an article states *Caffeine crime: 11 indicted in a massive 5-Hour Energy scam* with the indictments being the news of the story, you shouldn't start your first response with **"This** happened 3 years ago."

Yes I was talking about a topic, and you tried to derail it with misdirection talking about something totally different, the indictments.

Wait, so, you trying to talk about media conspiracy is **NOT** trying to derail a subject but talking about the indictments, which are the main point of the news article is?  Uh huh.  OH.  

You've added nothing to the conversation, just trolling. 

I've provided factual information.  You have yet to do so.

Yes there is a literal conspiracy if many TV media stations are sponsored by 5 Hour Energy and ignore news about it. 

I already asked for the proof of this.  Are you going to show it or not?  If not, well, we all know you're full of crap.

That is the definition of a conspiracy.

Proof?  Evidence?

Conspiracies happen all the time. 

Oh boy.  How many tin foil hats do you own?

Your attempt at using "conspiracy" as a derogatory label is laughable.

And you're only supporting it.

Yes, of 5 links, you linked one news paper's online page. The rest, as I said were garbage. I also graciously pointed out that Fortune covered it too. 

They're only garbage because you don't want them to be credible.  Why?  We'll get to that in a minute.  Graciously pointed out "Fortune?"  Fortune was cited in the article up above genius.  I guess you didn't read it.

You seem to be trying really hard to disprove something that isn't here. 

No, I didn't have to try hard at all.  I already disproved the below statements you made with the five links I provided and the Fortune article that this news source cites.  Oh, and you citing Fortune yourself just kills your own conspiracy topic.

Was the public notified? 

it is that the public never heard one peep from the media about this 3 years ago 

 5 hour energy sales would have tanked if the public knew

See?  The public was made aware.  Wasn't hard to shoot your theory out the window.

There is nothing here

Yes.  I know.  I've read your posts.

but you being confused and trolling.

Says the guy playing conspiracy and sadly trying to redirect the point of the article.

You are just a time waster.

If a fruit cake contains alcohol, it could remain edible for many years. For example, a fruit cake baked in 1878 is kept as an heirloom by a family (Morgan L. Ford) in Tecumseh, Michigan. In 2003 it was sampled by Jay Leno on The Tonight Show. Wrapping the cake in alcohol-soaked linen before storing is one method of lengthening its shelf life.

Devils Tower (Lakota: Mat Thpila ("Bear Lodge") or Pteh  ("Brown Buffalo Horn") (Arapaho: Wox Niiinon [5]) is an igneous intrusion or laccolith in the Bear Lodge Mountains (part of the Black Hills) near Hulett and Sundance in Crook County, northeastern Wyoming, above the Belle Fourche River. It rises dramatically 1,267 feet (386 m) above the surrounding terrain and the summit is 5,114 feet (1,559 m) above sea level.

Devils Tower was the first declared United States National Monument, established on September 24, 1906, by President Theodore Roosevelt. The Monument's boundary encloses an area of 1,347 acres (545 ha).

In recent years, about 1% of the Monument's 400,000 annual visitors climbed Devils Tower, mostly using traditional climbing techniques.

The name Devil's Tower originated in 1875 during an expedition led by Col. Richard Irving Dodge when his interpreter misinterpreted the name to mean Bad God's Tower, which then became Devil's Tower. All information signs in that area use the name "Devils Tower", following a geographic naming standard whereby the apostrophe is eliminated. 



















  You say this just happened

Yes.  The **INDICTMENTS** just happened.  Or did you not bother reading both the title and article themselves?

but then you list 5 links proving it happened up until 2012

Please provide me the sections of each of those five articles that state the indictments happened in 2012.

You keep trying to misdirect the conversation into being **about the indictments**

You mean what the posted news article is about?

which I was never talking about

Then why participate at all?  Oh, yeah, media conspiracy......

Just say, "oh, I thought you were talking about the indictment, not the actual crime."

The article is about the indictments.  You trying to go elsewhere is just preaching conspiracy from your soapbox.  Additionally, anybody who reads your first post knows you weren't focused on the crime itself.  Again, conspiracy.

Half of your news sources are unheard of crap. 

Yet they remain in existence today meaning that people are paying for it.

One is a local news source.

Well, you've got two that include the 11th and 28th rated media markets in the country.  And two other sites that reported on it that, again, remain in existence today meaning people are reading it.

US Today is the other

USA Today, the country's most widely circulated newspaper.

Fortune covered it at the time too.

So you just identified a 6th one.

Just because a couple websites covered it doesn't mean the majority of TV news which is frequently sponsored by 5-Hour Energy didn't conveniently ignore it.

Can you provide proof that others "conveniently" ignored it?  I mean hell, one of the sources was a Fox affiliate.  The very organization that would probably be least likely to go against anything corporate.  Oh, then you had this gem:

The point is not and never was that the indictments happened 3 years ago, it is that the public never heard one peep from the media about this 3 years ago

Which you just invalidated yourself by identifying one source.  Nevermind the first five I grabbed from the first page of a Google search.

Keep drinking the conspiracy Kool-Aid!



 




 Done.

Sorry about that. 




 This happened 3 years ago

Title of article: *Caffeine crime: 11 indicted in a massive 5-Hour Energy scam*

Date of article: *19 June 2015*

Thus, the indictments did not happen three years ago.  They **JUST** happened.  

Corporate control of the media in action. 5 hour energy sales would have tanked if the public knew the market was flooded with dangerous counterfeit products.

 And when did the indictments happen? 




 Actually, no, that's not the point of the article.  You should run along to /r/conspiracy.   




 Did you even read the title of the article?  You know, the main point?  Where it says "11 indicted" which is the point of the article?

The Native American Party, renamed in 1855 as American Party, and commonly named Know Nothing movement, was an American political party that operated on a national basis during the mid-1850s. It promised to purify American politics by limiting or ending the influence of Irish Catholics and other immigrants, thus reflecting nativism and anti-Catholic sentiment. It was empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by German and Irish Catholic immigrants, whom they saw as hostile to republican values and controlled by the Pope in Rome. Mainly active from 1854 to 1856, it strove to curb immigration and naturalization, but met with little success. Membership was limited to Protestant men. There were few prominent leaders, and the largely middle-class membership fragmented over the issue of slavery.The origin of the "Know Nothing" term was in the semi-secret organization of the party. When a member was asked about its activities, he was supposed to reply, "I know nothing." Outsiders called them "Know-Nothings", and the name stuck. In 1855, the Know-Nothings first entered politics under the American Party label.

The death of Jesse James became a national sensation. The Fords made no attempt to hide their role. Indeed, Robert Ford wired the governor to claim his reward. Crowds pressed into the little house in St. Joseph to see the dead bandit, even while the Ford brothers surrendered to the authorities but they were dismayed to find that they were charged with first degree murder. In the course of a single day, the Ford brothers were indicted, pleaded guilty, were sentenced to death by hanging and two hours later were granted a full pardon by Governor Crittenden.

The governor's quick pardon suggested he knew the brothers intended to kill James rather than capture him. The implication that the chief executive of Missouri conspired to kill a private citizen startled the public and added to James' notoriety.

Tajiri first thought of Pokmon around 1989 or 1990, when the Game Boy was
first released. **The concept of the Pokmon universe, in both the video games
and the general fictional world of Pokmon, stems from the hobby of insect
collecting, a popular pastime which Pokmon executive director Satoshi Tajiri
enjoyed as a child.** Players of the games are designated as Pokmon Trainers,
and in the main series Pokmon games, these trainers have two general goals.
These are to complete the Pokdex by collecting all of the available Pokmon
species found in the fictional region where that game takes place; and to
train a team of powerful Pokmon from those they have caught to compete
against teams owned by other Trainers, and eventually win the fictional
Pokmon League. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present
in almost every version of the Pokmon franchise, including the video games,
the anime and manga series, and the Pokmon Trading Card Game.

For three months Curcio observed a Brinks armored car make its deliveries to
the Bank of America branch in Monroe, Washington, and he took notes of the
schedule and diagrammed locations of the banks cameras and the armored cars
blind spots. He also estimated how much money was being transferred to the
bank and how much was being removed via ATM machines.

When he considered police protocol in responding to robberies, the location
of the bank and their containment of roads he realized he needed a good
getaway plan. Thats when he decided on using the local river to escape.

After weeks of hand-dredging the river (Woods Creek) and a failed practice
attempt using a jet ski for the getaway, he changed his approach and created a
cable pulley system to quickly pull himself and large bags of cash, upstream
in the river using a connected canvas-wrapped inner tube.

Curcios planning culminated with an advertisement he placed on Craigslist a
few days before the robbery. The online ad sought 15 to 20 workers for a
fictitious city cleanup project, promising $28.50 an hour. The laborers were
told to wear jeans, a blue shirt, work shoes and a yellow safety vest. The ad
also told the applicants they needed to bring safety goggles and a painters
mask. The ad directed them to meet in the Bank of America parking lot at the
exact time Curcio planned to rob the armored car.

On Sept. 30, 2008, Curcio, dressed identically to his decoy applicants,
pretended to work the grounds near the bank. Wearing a blue shirt, jeans,
yellow safety vest, work boots and painters mask, he pepper-sprayed the
Brinks armored-car guard who was pushing a dolly loaded with money into the
bank. The pepper spray forced the guard to reach for his eyes and release the
cart that held the money. Curcio grabbed two bags of money, containing more
than $400,000, and ran toward the creek. Meanwhile, police arrived to find the
banks parking lot filled with men matching the robbers description.

At the waters edge, Curcio threw the money into the inner tube, and he
pulled himself down the creek with the cables he had previously strung. He
travelled about 200 yards downstream and exited the creek behind several
businesses on the opposite side of the highway as the bank.

Curcio removed his wig and construction outfit that had been attached by Velcro revealing
different attire underneath. He hopped in a getaway vehicle and left.

Curcios careful planning and unusual getaway gained national attention. The
timing of the robbery came just days after announcements of the governments
$700 billion bailout package that included Bank of America. The unique robbery
techniques created folk lore for the mysterious robber who was referred to as
"D.B. Tuber" after famed hijacker D.B. Cooper.

Bass is also famous in Japan for the "Curse of the Colonel". Following the 1985 Series victory, revelers celebrated by calling off the names of team members one by one. At each name, a fan who looked like that player would jump into the filthy Dotonbori canal. For Bass, someone threw a life-sized model of Colonel Sanders, the mascot of Kentucky Fried Chicken and the only close-at-hand likeness of a bearded American, into the river. The statue disappeared and is said to have caused the subsequent decade-long dismal performance in the Central League.

In an attempt to remove the curse, fans made repeated attempts to find the model, making offerings to the statues of the Colonel for forgiveness. In 2003, when the Tigers returned to the Japan Series after 18 years with one of the worst records in the Central League, many KFC outlets in Kbe and saka moved their Colonel Sanders statues inside until the series was over to protect them from rabid Tigers fans. The newly replaced Colonel Sanders statue in the Dotonbori KFC branch was bolted down to prevent a repeat of the incident.

On March 10, 2009, the top half of the statue (minus hands and legs) originally thrown into the Dotonbori River was recovered during construction of a walkway. A diver said that he had thought he had found a large barrel, but was surprised when it turned out to be the upper body of the Colonel. The statue's legs and right hand were recovered the following day. The statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. The statue of Colonel Sanders is currently in a KFC franchise across the street from Koshien Stadium.

As a boy, John Wilkes Booth was athletic and popular, becoming skilled at horsemanship and fencing. A sometimes indifferent student, he attended the Bel Air Academy (now Bel Air High School), where the headmaster described him as "[n]ot deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time". In 18501851, he attended the Quaker-run Milton Boarding School for Boys located in Sparks, Maryland, and later St. Timothy's Hall, an Episcopal military academy in Catonsville, Maryland, beginning when he was 13 years old. At the Milton school, students recited such classical works as those by Herodotus, Cicero, and Tacitus. Students at St. Timothy's wore military uniforms and were subject to a regimen of daily formation drills and strict discipline. Booth left school at 14, after his father's death.

While attending the Milton Boarding School, Booth met a Gypsy fortune-teller who read his palm and pronounced a grim destiny, telling Booth that he would have a grand but short life, doomed to die young and "meeting a bad end". His sister recalled that Booth wrote down the palm-reader's prediction and showed it to his family and others, often discussing its portents in moments of melancholy in later years.

3) Troll. Trolling does not contribute to the conversation.

4) Complain about other users reposting/rehosting stories, images, videos, or any other content. Users should give credit where credit should be given, but if someone fails to do so, and is not causing harm, please either don't point it out, or point it out politely and leave it at that. They are only earning karma, which has little to no use at all.

5) Complain about reposts. Just because you have seen it before doesn't mean everyone has. Votes indicate the popularity of a post, so just vote. Keep in mind that linking to previous posts is not automatically a complaint; it is information.

 What do you mean by "active combat?"  Is this a reference to the infantry?  Because there are plenty of other jobs in the military that bring females outside the wire and potentially into "active combat."  You never know when the attack is going to happen or from where. 




 Here's the bottom line.  

You think people who *chase* karma are sad.

Yet, you **stalk people on the internet** who supposedly *chase* karma.  

There's really nothing more to say. 




 My post history has nothing to do with this conversation.

It displays to everyone that you're the type of poster who lacks attention in real life so you jump online to get it.

You posted a shitty link. 

Great.  I'm glad you thought so.  That's why they have up/down vote options.  However, if you'd like to continue to display to everyone that you have nothing to contribute to anything, keep posting the way you do.  Additionally, being that you made your first post a minute and a half after I posted it, it's probably a safe bet that you didn't even read the article anyway.

Got your back up

Yeah, I called him up on my CB radio.  /s  Get a grip.  It's just another person who sees what a dolt you are.

when called on your narrow minded bullshit

I posted an article.  Not much to be open/narrow minded about.

you were very liberal with your google searches. 

I pulled the top definition down of two words.  Not that complicated.  I'm sorry if you're upset that you didn't understand what they meant.   




 Or you could actually contribute to a discussion about the story at hand instead of acting like a moron because you didn't care about the article.

Then again, looking at your [post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/DaMonic), I probably shouldn't be expecting anything meaningful.

You want to call people out for reposting but honestly, going back to see if something was posted before so you can come back to call someone out is what's actually pathetic.

Nevermind the fact that this post and the one from 8 months ago use different sources.

 Only people that care about reddit 

Oh please get over yourself.  You sound like some self-righteous pretentious prick.  Reddit is doing just fine without your "concern."

telling you to please stop you mean

Well, first of all when some unknown stranger on the internet wants to *tell* me to do something, I immediately disregard them.  Additionally, stop what?  Posting topics I find interesting?  You may have seen it before.  Good for you.  You're not everybody.  Not everybody has seen everything before.  

You clearly don't understand how it works if you think reddit needs/has to have reposts.

You clearly can't read and comprehend if you think I said reddit needs/has to have reposts.  

You can sort a subreddit by best and catchup anytime.

I don't care.  Not how I use the site.  

This works great but they have to delete (hide) all the reposts for it to to work well.

And at some point, there will be no new content as everything is eventually a repost.  For someone who wants people to post OC, you should take your own advice as you've provided very little OC over the past few years you've been a member.  Quit being a bottom feeder, complaining about what people post, and contribute yourself.  I mean, Jesus dude, you actually [stated](http://redd.it/3azpgy) that you like to follow people around and hound them about karma.  Go outside, hop on your bike, and go for a ride.  There is more to life than reddit and the karma that you claim is meaningless yet actually stalk people over.

 Only sad people chase after it to get it. 

Additionally, only sad people worry about people chasing it.

Going for karma at the expense of reddit

Reddit is the one that set in motion the karma aspect.

adding reposts,

The site is 10 years old.  Other than subreddits like /r/news, everything is eventually a repost.

re-indexing wikipedia pointlessly

/r/todayilearned states it's a reliable source to use in their subreddit.  So what's the issue?

I don't know, you seem to be wound up a bit too tight about meaningless things (karma/reddit/wikipedia).

At the time of founding, it was not considered appropriate to mention the word cancer in public. Information concerning this illness was cloaked in a climate of fear and denial. Over 75,000 people died each year of cancer in just the United States. The top item on the founders agenda was to raise awareness of cancer, before any other progress could be made in funding research. Therefore a frenetic writing campaign was undertaken to educate doctors, nurses, patients and family members about cancer. Articles were written for popular magazines and professional journals. The ASCC undertook to publish their own journal, Campaign Notes, which was a monthly bulletin with information about cancer. They began recruiting doctors from all over the United States to help educate the public about cancer.

Users telephoned his home and he received death threats. Matt eventually proved that he was genuine by uploading his doctor's records.

 The Boondock Saints is a 1999 American crime film written and directed by Troy Duffy. The film stars Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as fraternal twins, Connor and Murphy MacManus, who become vigilantes after killing two members of the Russian Mafia in self-defense. After both experience an epiphany, the brothers, together with their friend "Funny Man" (David Della Rocco), set out to rid their home city of Boston, Massachusetts of crime and evil, all while being pursued by FBI Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe).

Duffy indicates that the screenplay was inspired by personal experience, while living in Los Angeles. Initially regarded as one of the hottest scripts in Hollywood, the movie had a troubled production and was finally given a limited theatrical release of only five theaters for one week due to the Columbine High School massacre. It was met with poor critical reviews; however, the film ultimately grossed about $50 million in domestic video sales and developed a large cult following.

 While Sega was seeking a flagship series to compete with Nintendo's Mario series with a character to replace Alex Kidd as the company's mascot, several character designs were submitted by its Sega AM8 research and development department. Many results came forth from their experiments with character design, including an armadillo (who was later developed into Mighty the Armadillo), a dog, a Theodore Roosevelt look-alike in pajamas (who would later be the basis of Dr. Robotnik/Eggman's design), and a rabbit (who would use its extendable ears to collect objects, an aspect later incorporated in Ristar).

Eventually, Naoto Ohshima's spiky teal hedgehog, initially codenamed "Mr. Needlemouse",was chosen as the new mascot. Sonic's blue pigmentation was chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo, and his shoes evolved from a design inspired by Michael Jackson's boots with the addition of the color red, which was inspired by both Santa Claus and the contrast of those colors on Jackson's 1987 album Bad; his personality was based on Bill Clinton's "Get it done" attitude.

 Christopher Lloyd was cast as Doc Brown after the first choice, John Lithgow, became unavailable. Having worked with Lloyd on The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (1984), producer Neil Canton suggested him for the part. Lloyd originally turned down the role, but changed his mind after reading the script and at the persistence of his wife. He improvised some of his scenes, taking inspiration from Albert Einstein and conductor Leopold Stokowski. Brown pronounces gigawatts as "jigawatts", which was the way a physicist said the word when he met with Zemeckis and Gale as they researched the script, rather than with an initial hard "g", although both pronunciations are acceptable. Doc Brown's notable hunch came about because at 6'1" Lloyd was considerably taller than Fox at 5'5", and they needed to look closer in height.

 Tom Scholz was born in Toledo, Ohio and raised in the suburb of Ottawa Hills. His father, Don Scholz, was a homebuilder who garnered considerable wealth from his designs of prefabricated luxury houses and founded Scholz Design, the forerunner of Scholz Homes Inc.

His mother Olive was valedictorian of her class, and went on to become an architectural designer and a landscape architect.

As a child, Scholz studied classical piano. He also had a penchant for tinkering with everything from go-carts to model airplanes and was always building or designing. A top student and a member of the varsity basketball team, he graduated from Ottawa Hills High School in 1965. Prior to his musical career, Scholz received both a bachelor's degree (1969) and a master's degree (1970) in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked for Polaroid Corporation as a senior product design engineer. Scholz would then reside in Boston.

 In 1998, the tabloid newspaper The Globe reported that Malone had been a defendant in paternity lawsuits, filed shortly after Malone began his professional basketball career in the late 1980s, which alleged that he was the father of three children by two women from his hometown of Summerfield, Louisiana: Demetress Bell and twins Daryl and Cheryl Ford. Malone was 17 when the Ford twins were born to Bonita Ford, who was approximately the same age. However, Malone was a 20-year old college sophomore when Gloria Bell, at age 13, gave birth to Demetress. In the aftermath of the Globe story, Malone met with the Ford twins for the first time since visiting them in the hospital after they were born. Malone did not meet with Bell at that time, and Malone's attorney insisted that Malone had settled the lawsuits prior to any conclusive establishment of paternity, and thus still did not know whether he was truly the father of any of the children.

The Tribune confirmed that the judge in the Bell lawsuit ruled Malone to be the father, not based on presented evidence, but rather because Malone did not respond to the suit. However, the paper also examined court documents detailing the evidence that was to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One of the items listed was a laboratory blood test which concluded with over 99 percent certainty that Bell's father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying that same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone. According to the Tribune, Malone challenged the court's ruling with regard to Bell, claiming that the judgment holding him responsible for $125 per week in child support, plus past and future medical expenses, was excessive. Before Malone's appeal was adjudicated, the lawsuit was settled on confidential terms. In the case regarding the Ford twins, Malone was ruled to be their father when he violated a court order by refusing to reveal his assets or submit to a DNA test. Thereafter, another out-of-court settlement was reached.

By the fall of 1998, Malone accepted his paternity of the Ford twins, and Kay Malone spoke publicly of the twins being members of the Malone family. Since that time, Karl Malone has maintained a relationship with the twins, each of whom later played college basketball at his alma mater of Louisiana Tech University. Cheryl Ford went on to a professional basketball career with the Detroit Shock of the Women's National Basketball Association.

To date, Malone has made no public comment with regard to Bell, who is now an offensive lineman for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League. In 2008, The Buffalo News reported that Bell's first and only meeting with Malone came shortly after Bell graduated from high school. According to Bell, Malone told him at that time that it was "too late" for them to have a father-son relationship.

A Brazilian woman has confessed to trying to kill her husband by putting poison in her vagina and urging him to have oral sex with her, a news agency claims.

The bizarre murder plot, dubbed "cunning cunnilingus" by one commentator, took place in the city of Sao de Jose Rio Preto.
The intended victim, a 43-year-old man who has not been named, says his wife tried to lure him into bed and encouraged him to perform oral sex on her. His suspicions were aroused when he noticed an unusual odour emanating from her private parts and, fearing she was unwell, took her to hospital, Brazil's Tvi24 reports. Medical tests revealed she had doused her vagina with enough of the unspecified toxin to kill both her husband and herself.

Confronted with the test results the woman reportedly confessed to her crime. It is believed she hatched the bizarre plot after asking her husband for a divorce, a request he now seems rather more likely to acquiesce to. Tvi24 says the woman has received medical treatment and sources claim her husband plans to sue her for attempted murder.

 Unable to support himself, on May 27, 1827, Poe enlisted in the United States Army as a private. Using the name "Edgar A. Perry", he claimed he was 22 years old even though he was 18. He first served at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor for five dollars a month. That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry, Tamerlane and Other Poems, attributed with the byline "by a Bostonian". Only 50 copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention. Poe's regiment was posted to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina and traveled by ship on the brig Waltham on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to "artificer", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his monthly pay doubled. After serving for two years and attaining the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank a noncommissioned officer can achieve), Poe sought to end his five-year enlistment early. He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard. Howard would only allow Poe to be discharged if he reconciled with John Allan and wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic. Several months passed and pleas to Allan were ignored; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, John Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point.

Poe finally was discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him. Before entering West Point, Poe moved back to Baltimore for a time, to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter, Virginia Eliza Clemm (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe. Meanwhile, Poe published his second book, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems, in Baltimore in 1829.

Poe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, John Allan married his second wife, Louisa Patterson. The marriage, and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs, led to the foster father finally disowning Poe. Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically pled not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing he would be found guilty.

Bologna sausage, sometimes phonetically spelled as baloney, boloney or polony, is a sausage derived from the Italian mortadella, a similar looking finely ground pork sausage containing cubes of lard, originally from the Italian city of Bologna.  U.S. Government regulations require American bologna to be finely ground  and without visible pieces of lard. Bologna can alternatively be made out of chicken, turkey, beef, pork, venison or soy protein. Unlike the mortadella, bologna sausage is not an Italian product and there are several differences among process and ingredients. Typical seasoning for bologna includes black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, celery seed, coriander, and like mortadella, myrtle berries give it its distinctive flavor.

Estes then announced a new car line, project designation XP-836, with a name that Chevrolet chose in keeping with other car names beginning with the letter C such as the Corvair, Chevelle, Chevy II, and Corvette. He claimed the name, suggests the comradeship of good friends as a personal car should be to its owner and that to us, the name means just what we think the car will do... go. The Camaro name was then unveiled. Automotive press asked Chevrolet product managers, what is a Camaro? and were told it was a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs.

 Bridget Driscoll (1851  17 August 1896) was the first pedestrian victim of an automobile collision in the United Kingdom. As she and her teenage daughter May and her friend Elizabeth Murphy crossed Dolphin Terrace in the grounds of the Crystal Palace in London, Driscoll was struck by an automobile belonging to the Anglo-French Motor Carriage Company that was being used to give demonstration rides. One witness described the car as travelling at "a reckless pace, in fact, like a fire engine".

Although the car's maximum speed was 8 miles per hour (13 km/h) it had been limited deliberately to 4 miles per hour (6.4 km/h), the speed at which the driver, Arthur James Edsall of Upper Norwood, claimed to have been travelling. His passenger, Alice Standing of Forest Hill, alleged he modified the engine to allow the car to go faster, but another taxicab driver examined the car and said it was incapable of exceeding 4.5 miles per hour (7.2 km/h) because of a low-speed engine belt. The accident happened just a few weeks after a new Act of Parliament had increased the speed limit for cars to 14 miles per hour (23 km/h), from 2 miles per hour in towns and 4 miles per hour in the countryside.

What drives these people to farm karma?  Why do they care?

Here's what I do.  I find reddit to be entertaining.  I also find it interesting to read about random news (not just the big national crap but the local news around the country), politics, and in regards to what I post on TIL, what I usually post comes from my thinking/seeing/doing something and I do a quick search on the topic and post something interesting.  

Why?  Eh, more about curiosity to see how well something will do.  I'm usually surprised at what does well and what doesn't.  Also, in regards to news, I eventually want to have every state/country covered in a submission.  No real reason.  Like I said, just entertainment for those short moments in time at work/home where I need a breather from the regular crap.  I figure finding out new information/news and sharing it is more useful than, say, Candy Crush.

Like empty accusations.

The AMA's by people who do this have admitted to obscuring with other inane submissions.

You apparently haven't "snooped" either.

The concept of a tin foil hat for protection against interference of the mind was mentioned in a science fiction short story by Julian Huxley, "The Tissue-Culture King", first published in 1927, in which the protagonist discovers that "caps of metal foil" can block the effects of telepathy.

Over time the term has been associated with paranoia and conspiracy theories. It is often associated with beliefs that tin foil hats prevent mind control by governments, spies, or paranormal beings that employ ESP or the microwave auditory effect. 









 You should probably look at the rest of my submission history then and compare the ratio of those ones listed to the rest of what I post.  I threw about 6-7 TIL subject items up this morning.  This being the only one about a current product.  Quite honestly, I thought the ones about Ray Bradbury, the people falling into a cesspool of human waste, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind would do better.

Know when I found those out?  Last night.  While I was drinking a Sierra Nevada IPA that I had with my frozen pizza.  And I looked up Sierra Nevada to see if there was anything interesting because while I'm at work, I like to post random crap I find to see how much karma it will get.  Lo and behold this topic was in there.  Nevermind all the articles I post in /r/news, /r/politics, and whatever state/country I can find an interesting topic to post in their specific subreddit just to see if I can cover every state and/or country.

After reading some of the posts here, maybe I should go find some interesting facts about aluminum foil because all I can picture some of you wearing are foil hats.

 In East Asia, same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history.
Homosexuality in China, known as the passions of the cut peach and various other euphemisms has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. Homosexuality was mentioned in many famous works of Chinese literature. The instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber seem as familiar to observers in the present as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period. Confucianism, being primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality, whether homosexual or heterosexual. Ming Dynasty literature, such as Bian Er Chai (/), portray homosexual relationships between men as more enjoyable and more "harmonious" than heterosexual relationships. Writings from the Liu Song Dynasty by Wang Shunu claimed that homosexuality was as common as heterosexuality in the late 3rd century.

Opposition to homosexuality in China originates in the medieval Tang Dynasty (618907), attributed to the rising influence of Christian and Islamic values, but did not become fully established until the Westernization efforts of the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China.

 In high school, Ray Bradbury was active in both the Poetry Club and the Drama club, continuing plans to become an actor but becoming serious about his writing as his high school years progressed. Bradbury graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh, and short story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson. The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing, but he did not attend college. Instead, he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. In regard to his education, Bradbury said:

Libraries raised me. I don't believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries because most students don't have any money. When I graduated from high school, it was during the Depression and we had no money. I couldn't go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years. 

He told The Paris Review, "You can't learn to write in college. It's a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do  and they dont."

 Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. won the US Environmental Protection Agency's "Green Business of the Year" award for 2010.

The brewery is powered by solar energy, having 10,000 photovoltaic modules covering its rooftops and parking lot. In all, the brewery uses 2.6 megawatts of solar electricity on premises.[20] It also has built a charging station for electric vehicles on its premises.

The company processes used cooking oil from its restaurant for biodiesel use in its delivery trucks. In 2009, it reached an agreement with a local ethanol company to produce high-grade ethanol fuel from its discarded yeast. Spent grain is sold to local cattle ranchers for livestock feed; spent water is sent to the brewery's own water treatment plant, where it is reused, mainly as drip irrigation for its fields. Over 99.5% of the brewery plant's solid waste is diverted from landfill.

Sierra Nevada is the largest buyer of organic hops in the United States. It also farms its own organic hops and barley for use in its annual Chico Estate Harvest Ale release.

 The film's origins can be traced to director Steven Spielberg's youth, when he and his father watched a meteor shower in New Jersey. As a teenager, Spielberg completed the full-length science fiction film Firelight. Many scenes from Firelight would be incorporated in Close Encounters on a shot-for-shot basis. In 1970 he wrote a short story called Experiences about a lovers' lane in a Midwestern United States farming community and the "light show" a group of teenagers see in the night sky. In late 1973, during post-production on The Sugarland Express, Spielberg developed a deal with Columbia Pictures for a science fiction film. 20th Century Fox previously turned down the offer. Julia and Michael Phillips instantly signed on as producers.

Two people died and three were injured after wading into a cesspool's knee-deep filth in an attempt to retrieve a woman's mobile phone and rescue those who fainted.

The two fatalities were the woman's husband and mother-in-law, a local newspaper reported.

The tragedy unfolded after the young woman in Xinxiang city, Henan, accidentally dropped her brand new phone into a cesspit when she went to the open-pit toilet on Wednesday, according to local newspaper Dahe Daily.

Her husband jumped in to find the 2,000-yuan (HK$2,510) phone but he could not breathe and soon lost consciousness.

Then, the husband's mother jumped in to save him but she, too, soon lost consciousness. In panic, the young woman followed and suffered the same fate.

Seeing his family lying helpless in waste, her father-in-law called to neighbours for help.

When they arrived, the old man also entered the cesspit but could not get out while two neighbours who jumped inside fainted.

The smell was too strong. I lost consciousness before I could see anything, said a neighbour.

Other villagers found a rope and tied it on rescuers who, taking turns, pulled six people out of the pit.

The husband and mother-in-law died in hospital while the woman and a neighbour remained in the intensive care unit. The father-in-law was also injured.

The woman and her husband had a one-year-old son.

Villagers said the victims were in the pit  which was knee deep in waste for no more than five minutes.

A hospital doctor said the victims suffocated.

Villagers said the dead victims had pulses after being pulled out but the ambulance did not arrive for more than an hour.
