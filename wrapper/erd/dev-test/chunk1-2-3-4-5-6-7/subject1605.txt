Bartender comes back a little bit later and since its a pretty slow night, he decides to chit-chat with the customer. After a little bit the bartender asks the man what he does for a living. 

Customer says, "I'm a Center for the Dallas Cowboys."

Bartender replies, "Man, it must be really tough having to do that."

"Its not too bad. I enjoy it" 

"No, I meant being openly gay in Texas."

 I know its a bit out of context for a lot of us, however I've been mostly free for a bit now, though I feel lie I'm starting to fall into depression again. (Bi-polar II / manic depressive since I was a kid.) 

Back story; Met a lovely lady a year (around abouts) ago at a mutual friend's birthday party. Nice woman, perhaps a bit drunk, talked a while, facebook friends later. 

Get to talking, she's pretty cool, works in graphic design, responds positively to advances, sexual exchanges including suggestive photographs even though she's in a relationship (I knew) plus she's 13 years older (I'm mature, she's immature). 

We continue talking, life, love, sex all that, advances that she reciprocates to the extent of still being with someone. (Nothing ever happened though it very well could have. Yes, I know. Cheats with you, cheats on you.)

Around her birthday, her BF dumps her, kicks her out, for reasons that she either didn't tell me or he never told her. After a while she agrees to go to lunch with me and then the next week come over and let me make her dinner and watch a movie with drinks. 

Week later, she has to skip dinner because she said she found out he cheated on her and was feeling sick as a result, then tells me later that week she has started seeing someone and that she is confused why I would be upset about this as she told me she couldn't date someone who worked at a bar or who was younger. 

I didn't take this as she thought I would, and that she thought she made that clear before. Back and forth for a few weeks, things said in anger and with inhibition on both sides. 

Anyway, I get past that, ask her how its going, blah blah blah, ask her about her drinking. 

She says she stopped a few weeks ago. (lightbulb) I say good that she stopped drinking so much as it elt like half the times I talked to her she had been. 

And of course, it appears she was. 

Fucking of course, clearly no one could be interested in me unless they were drunk half the time. I don't even know why I try. 

This is more of a rant about the slide of someone with the history of depression than the life of, But, IDFC shit happens.

 I was diagnosed when I was 11. Every step I have taken since has tightened the noose around my neck. High School was easy, living with the possibility of escape in alcohol is difficult. I'm 27. I work as a bouncer in a club. I might be good at it, but the discount on drinks is worth even more. I work 3 nights a week, and the nights I'm off, I spend $40-80 on cheap whiskey. 

Ever wonder what life is like when you have barriers no one will break?

I like to call it The Slide. You know its happening, you know why, but there isn't a damn thing you can do about it.

Do you know what its like to ask for help and the only response you get is silence? Ever wonder what life is like when you ask yourself if you have to kill someone to fucking notice?

Something the size of a pen that could detect what color something is. You'd put it up to the color you want to 'collect' and you could store like 500 or so colors. Then you could hook it up to a computer and you would see all the different colors you caught and the hex code and the Pantone or other companies info on the color. 

There would be different levels of product- RGB or CMYK; 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 captures; how nice the pen looks (like a nice fountain pen); bluetooth connectivity to your tablet or phone so you can check the color if you'd like. 



















 I've been working on a campaign for a local candidate and I needed to find a way to describe him in a tagline.

 I had a motorcycle accident when I was 19. I saw her crossing the traffic, I had the right of way, she just pulled in front of me. Nothing I could do. 

I lived in Florida at the time and the only thing that went through my head was "I hope she has insurance." I was wearing my helmet and it's a good thing I was because there's no graceful way to land when you flip head first over and 35 feet past a car. 

Broke my clavicle and needed surgery, its a good thing she had insurance otherwise I would have been fucked for years. FHP at the hospital told me I was lucky, most of the motorcycle accidents he saw were deaths or in so much pain they couldn't answer questions.

 What kind of maggot gives people gold for puns? 




 Example:

The bar I used to work at Served Evan Williams Green Label at $3.50 a drink. Retail A fifth is ~$10.00. IF you get 20 servings from a bottle, 3.50 x 20 = 70. That's a 700% markup. Until you factor in rent, electric, maintenance, labor (and this really depends on location) etc, that bottle is 2-3x as expensive. 

The markup for anything is a significant amount, if you don't include overhead. 




 Ahh, drummer jokes.

 Accidental overdose maybe. Aderall, Ritalin, etc are considerably more safe than legal opioids or cocaine. 

Having used these types of drugs, you would have to experience considerable pain before you do major damage to yourself. 




 Well, didn't Aston make a shitty hatchback? 




 I've had about half a fifth of whiskey and it made sense in the manner that you were saying that coke was responsible for many deaths. 

Though, going back, I understand you were saying that legal amphetamines were responsible for many deaths, and on that I would have to disagree wholesale. The numbers do not suggest that RX amphetamines are killing remarkably large numbers of people.

 It depends on if you have a citizen working that tile after the improvement is completed. Citizen management can be adjusted if you click on the city and look at the drop down menu on the right.

If your city is not well fed, the ai may choose to put a citizen on a farm before hills or a mine. Or, if you have bonuses to tiles that may seem more useful. (Like if you have the sacred path pantheon with give +1 to jungle tiles.) 

Long answer short, yes your worker will likely be produced sooner, but if you want to make sure, citizen management in the the city screen is a good reference.

 It's more the idea that you have taken a pain reliever boosts its perceived ability upwards of half. 

So, if you took a sugar pill and was told it was tylenol or whatever, you would have some reduction in pain. Likewise, if you took a pill and were told it was a sugar pill, the pain reduction would be diminished. 

And this study was for OTC pain relievers, not opioids.  




 I saw a study that said ~43% of statistics are made up on the spot.  




 Saw a study that suggested upwards of 50% of a pain reliever's effect was placebo, people expecting it to work. 

So even if it does nothing, it could still do something. 




 Why would you... the fuck is wrong with you dude?

What did you say about mathematically impossible? 




 Its actually a brilliant move. They drown out competition, increase consumer confidence so they buy those big trucks again, and when the prices go back up there will still be competition, but the price will be even higher, allowing them to step in and buy the companies supplying the tar sands type oil. 

I mean yeah there's some niche shit to it, but damn, I hope they use lube on us later. Of course it might be too expensive. 




 No. But the level at which they decide to produce does have a direct effect on prices, in a less supply = higher prices way. 




 You just made a statement where you contradict yourself and that example is crap. 

Just so you know. 
 




 Holy shit. 




 I like pizza and cheap tvs. Deal with it ya damn hippie. 




 How do you figure? Instability equals a much less stable market. One government falling in the region has a huge impact on the market price for oil. 

And no serious coalition will form, its like herding cats, who have guns. 




 Back in my day we only had 3 channels and we liked it that way.

Seriously though, at least House was on, daytime TV is shit. 




 My point was more of once the oil prices start going back up hard to reach oil like the tar sands is going to become a viable source again. 

"Which could count as a geopolitical win in the Mid East region." 

We want that region as stable as possible, the fracturing of Iraq is the perfect example. Removing the leaders of a country with that many different tribes and sects all wanting the money is insane. 




 Eh, its a body part. Can get mixed up in the process. 




 Ugh. Conspiracy theories are so stupid. 




 Apparently some people have a misunderstanding of what Foul Bachelor Frog is all about. 




 A safeword should be a calm sounding word. Not too many hard consonants.

 It's a delaying of the inevitable. I do think the Saudis are trying to drive the competition away, but as long as there is money to be made... 

Another aspect people don't get is that unless the US subsidizes oil in a serious manner, we will still be effected. Oil goes to market first, then it ends up at the consumer.

 I dunno, I don't really want to have to deal with sjw nuts freaking out about slavery and whatnot for a game I really enjoy. 




 I'd like to see revolution like a civil war. Your cities can break off into another civ. Same UU UA and UB but with a Revolutionary Leader. 

I think that would be pretty damn cool. Flex number of empires would be a nice feature in general. Oh, this is a peaceful game and everyone is basically trying for a culture victory? Well, here's Attila or some other war civ. 




 I would make the supply line separate from the traditional trade route in that it doesn't really provide gpt for either. Maybe +1-2 for the owner. 

And I like the idea of supply lines because it allows for the FOBs.  




 So I've seen some good ideas to make war a bit more realistic, and it seems that most revolve around units. I have a few ideas that might change the mechanics of war.

Supply lines. Acts like a trade route to friendly cities that boosts military unit production and maybe city defenses. You could prop a city state to defend itself against another civ or a frontier city. 

Forward operating base. Much like a citadel without the adjacent damage, grants 75% defensive bonus and can be removed. If a supply line is attached it allows you to upgrade adjacent units you control for 33% more gold cost.


Unhappiness. For every 5 military units destroyed or captured in foreign lands unhappiness increases by 1. For every 5 enemy military units captured or destroyed in your land happiness increases by 1. The difference is reduced by one per turn after a peace treaty is signed.

 Holy fuck, you are a goddamn moron. Use of examples, you stupid shit, are not the whole but part. 

I have been saying, if you weren't to goddamned retarded to understand, that the top 5% of worldwide equates to like the top half of the US. So the implication that his family was super rich, WHEN HELD IN CONTEXT OF THE FUCKING COMMENT, is not as impressive as you claim it to be, you spineless, over-educated, under a stimulated twat. 




 I'm not discounting that compared to sub-saharan Africa or Amazonian Peru that's impressive, but when you put it in the US, not exactly fantastical. 




 Yes? 




 I always looked at it like this. You have X capacity to deal with crap. So you stuff the important things in and kind of ignore the rest. 

When you don't have to worry about eating, paying bills on time, or if you'll go broke because you have to go to the er to get anti-biotics, then you fill the tank with things that may seem trivial to many.

Is there something bothering you, having a rough day, what?  




 No shit dude, but in the context of your comment, not a big deal. 




 You do realize that top 5% isn't really that impressive. If that were people based he could be the 300 millionth richest person on the planet. That's middle class-ish. 

If you figure the average family is 2 adults, 2.2 kids you have 7 billion/4.2 you get 1 billion 666 million families. Top 5% families is 83.3 million families world-wide. 

Not really that impressive.

 The problem with your argument is that you are assigning a rare disorder to the larger population. 

That's like saying intelligent people shouldn't have a bias towards them because a small group of them ended up head of a despotic dictatorship. 

The common thread I'm finding here is that you believe bias towards height is unearned and based in genetic phantoms from our African savanna past and that it should be irrelevant. 

I hope you don't like women who have symmetrical faces or slightly wider hips. 




 So again, you're upset because of a slight mass bias towards taller people?

 What's going on? All I'm seeing is their steam profile. 




 "Not talking about height. I spend most of my time talking about heightism."

So you're mad because people believe that height is a marker for better genetics, or ability to take care of a family? Are you also mad at attractive people for being attractive?

 The point is to get people to question what they've been told, why they believe etc. Most people end up believing the religion they grew up in, without truly thinking about what it means. 

And then there are the people who use religion to justify murder, and fuck what those people think. If they want to be irrational asshats, fine, but don't expect me to give any consideration to their feelings. 

What happens when people don't think about what the believe, they become dogmatic and hardliners in getting others to believe, follow, and respect. Extremism begins when you don't allow others to question your beliefs.

Fuck that cheap Eagle bullshit. 




 I know what it's like to go through that at a young age. I'm glad you are better now.

 You don't know me, my background or what I believe towards how business and the state should operate. I haven't derided you in anyway, or inserted personal judgments in my statements. I'm looking at this from a logical point, and you keep trying to belittle me through statements that you have no proof for on top of attributing points of view that I haven't expressed. 

Calm down, just because I don't agree with how this might work out, doesn't mean I am Satan incarnate.  




 Pay attention to the words I am using, not the context you think is there. Think of this as monotone as you can make it.

the tax credit is worth less than the amount they would be applying to student loans.
The company gets a $450 dollar tax credit a year if they spend 1,800 a year paying down an employees debt

The company spends more on paying down student loans, than they would receive in tax credit, which (again) would not encourage hiring of new college grads. This requires businesses to spend more than they receive, which they are not inclined to do.

I think that as a means to an end, it's a bit too complex and likely ineffective. 

Just because it's AN answer doesn't make it the BEST answer.  




 Better than Ron Paul. 




 10th grade learning strategies class. 




 This wouldn't encourage businesses to hire college grads because the tax credit is worth less than the amount they would be applying to student loans. 

the point of this is to pay down the loans not give businesses more money.  




 State Legislatures hold most of the control for tuition rates in state schools, University of Florida, or Michigan State are examples. 

Private and for-profit schools need to have their reigns pulled in though, for sure. 




 Its more of remarking on how stupid it is that helping an individual is frowned upon or worse, but helping business is the best thing in the world. 

The idea that they have to go this far around to help pay down student debt because of appearances is ri-goddamn-diculous.

 Two kinds of people. 




 You're forgetting how much it costs to live. A loaf of bread costs the same for everyone, but it is a larger portion of total income to a poor person. 

There's basically a minimum cost of living if you have a place to live and that cost doesn't necessarily increase the more money you make. If you take 5% of someone making 20k versus 100k, the person making 20k has to make harder choices to cut, as opposed to the 100k person. 

The 100k person can still invest, afford property, play and not have to worry about paying the electric, or rent. the 20k person has much less room to save money, which means they can't take the actions that would allow them to increase their wealth like buying property, investing in retirement or the stock market. 

The point isn't that the person making 2mil doesn't deserve it, the point is that we operate more successfully if more people have the opportunity to make 2 mil.

However, it would really depend on the tribal hospital having a birth record of the grandmother being born to a native. As in on the birth certificate being born to 'this person' who is a tribe member. 

Then the father has to have his birth certificate updated, and then her birth certificate. Its a pain in the ass, and it will take a while, but it can be worth it. 

I'm getting health insurance for $0 co-pay $0 deductible because I have my certificate of native blood. 




 Fucking fascist. 

Sorry, all this lovey, not hating each other stuff felt a little weird. LOL. 




  they are mostly Native.

I don't believe you.

 Some Mexicans do. Some Native Americans are short. But statistically, Native Americans tend to be taller than their Caucasian counterparts. 

Jackass. 




 I get the tone. I just want to make sure we don't repeat mediocrity because someone isn't able to understand sarcasm. 

Also, defending my point because alcohol. 

Take that you fucking Islamic State asshats. 




 "that the experience has taught him to "never give up." "

Christ. Seriously, respect people's wishes. If someone does not want to be kept alive on a machine past a certain point, let them go. 

Also, get a medical directive set up. You could be in a shitty crash today and be in just pain for the rest of your life unless you tell your family.

"Winning Militarily" huh?

The opponent was maybe out-numbered, seriously outgunned and still gaining ground on a strategic level. 

On a just war, no politics level, they were handing us our ass in a war of attrition. 




 Confidence in being able to resolve an issue =/= hubris when we lose. 




 Oh jesus. Grow a pair you pussy bitch. 




 Cute kitty. I like the jeans bit. 




 Is that how we explain retreat? Instead of owning up to our mistakes and saying, "Shit."  




 I'm more of asking who has documented blood.  Not that 1/64th on you dad's side bull. 

I just got my certificate. Who here has traceable blood? 




 This is the funniest film review I've read. 

Maybe that's the 40 i just finished talking, but still. Hilarious.

 Those are campaign donations. 

It is actually pretty different than just paying the candidate. 

Scummy as fuck, but still different. 




 Tithe, Religious Community, then swords into plowshears or divine inspiration (because wonderlust) and Religious texts.

Religious texts really helps with tithe if you have nearby friendly city states or a major civ that didn't get a religion.

 I prefer Order for a science victory. +25% science from factories is pretty kick ass and I can stockpile engineers to complete spaceship parts.

 So two different people read into something, a perceived inflection, something that was incorrectly understood and I'm the asshole? 

How does that make sense? 




 See, there's a difference between what I said, and the way you took it. You inferred tone that I didn't have.  




 This is how we get into trouble. 

There is no tone to text, people make up what they feel or want to feel. So I end up sounding like an ass.

 You guys should start applying for shitty jobs. 

I got hired on a Thursday morning for a Thursday night security shift. I babysit an office building for 40 hours a week and they were so desperate they hired me after hearing "I'm ok with 3rd shift." "I can start immediately" and "I have reliable transportation." 




 I've done club security, if I had 2 people report this with me somehow missing it, dude or chick is on the street, I don't give a fuck who your daddy is. 

If I see you with your dick out, I'm not only going to throw you out, I'm going to use your head to open the door as well.

"You can warn the person living below the broken dam, but you can't make them move away." 




 Exactly. An 18 year old might have an appreciation for the drunkenness, but not the drink itself. 




 It was fucking dirty. Not like a diesel oil filter dirty, like an overused air filter dirty. 




 Yeah, but did you figure out whiskey before you figured out your partner?

My mind set is that people who think you should just go out and get a better job is crap because those people were afforded opportunities that they aren't willing to give to others. 

That and the climate for small business loans is shit. 




 "Any dumbass off the street can do your job." 

OMG. You are so right! What have I been thinking? Any dumbass can talk down a drug addicted parent who is raging up a storm in Child Protective Services. 

Any dumbass can hit someone with a maglight, it takes skill to get someone out of the building without hurting them or yourself. It takes skill to see the slight markers in demeanor or the trace of a weapon under clothing, remaining calm when someone is threatening you with a knife and being able to disarm and subdue them. 

Yeah, any dumbass. 




 That logic fills me with rage. I work as a security guard. There are times where I will literally have to risk my safety. Do you know how much that is worth? 

$8.75 an hour. I am lucky I get that and 40 hours a week because some job sites pay federal minimum wage. ($7.25)

Why don't you find a better job? Motherfucker, when I get off work at 8 in the fucking morning after working 32 hours in a span of 56, it isn't exactly easy to go out and do what I need to do. 

Why don't you just stay up and get stuff done during the day? Because if I sacrifice sleep, I sacrifice my ability to do my job well, and thereby risking my literal fucking life. 

Mothefucking useless pieces of willfully ignorant shit. Godfuckingdammit.

"I have a degree I know what I'm talking about." Yeah and you were wrong about shit three elections in a row. And the bullshit is that these were people who were at most a few years older than me.

 Maybe, maybe not. Maybe go fuck yourself. 




 You could always pay someone to fuck off for you. 




 That's more like price fixing than what the commenter was trying to convey. 




 Save it anyway. You can blend them with lighter roasts to add a little complexity or use it to make iced coffee drinks that don't get too washed out with the ice.

As long as it isn't well past a French roast, you can find something to use it in. 




 I'm hungover and I mentally associated it with a convection oven. 




 Depending on the govt for subsistence doesn't automatically make people lazy. Why do people not understand this?

I'm far more inclined to believe they would fight harder to defend it if it was threatened as it would be their source of food and water. 




 Apparently you and I have wildly different definitions of these things. 

Your roast was probably off because the beans need to be moving around and not stationary/ you burned the chaff back into the beans.

 Are you serious? That's not a snide comment, that's a pretty realistic statement. 

~30% of Americans get a Bachelor's degree or higher. Saying that the average voter has a reading comprehension at a high school level isn't even remotely snide. 




 See, this is what I'm talking about. Snide comments about someone's intelligence, particularly someone you don't know.

Messaging gets them on your side. Tell me the messaging in 2014 resonated with the voters. 

EDIT: "Messaging should be..." Yeah. In a vacuum, real world isn't a vacuum. 




 But Susie down the block says I should cut out X from what ever. She would never lie to me. The Dr. just tries to push pills or diet on me. In fact, I saw on the news about how Dr's take money from prescription companies to give people their drugs.
