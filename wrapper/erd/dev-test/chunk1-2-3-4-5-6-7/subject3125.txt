 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the NAvy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top snuper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with my precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak, I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't and now you're paying the price you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead,

 Iam currently struggling with my weight and I started to get control of it by joining my schools lacrosse team,but some days I just feel like giving it up and saying I don't care how I look when  I am truly lying to myself and I have gone on so many diets and list weight only to gain it all back and I know the   bullying at my school won't stop unless I lose weight.so if you could comment what motivates you to keep going.

 Hint: towards the bottom 





























 That's why I said maybe 




 I was just wondering what would happen if an angel and a demon had a child never said that's what was happening in the show that's why I used the words "what if" and "maybe"just some outside the box thinking that's all. 





























 Why do I feel alone even when surrounded by family and friends? I have been diagnosed with sever depression and anxiety but honestly who hasn't these days.i feel like I have no one I feel like my friends just talk to me to be nice but honestly they could care less and I know I love my family and they love me but damn, I just feel emotionless and alone. 



















 Somedays are good some are not...I feel like a complete failure to my family I can't even do school right I can't even start my day right I feel like anything I do is wrong and I feel alone sure I have people I talk to at school that call me their friend but I still feel alone I have no one close no one to share this with and it eats me up inside, I'm 16 and my life feels like a huge mistake like it was never meant to be I'm only 16 why me why ?
I just want to feel happy I just want this to stop I just want to feel normal again I want to have a day where I don't feel like a total screwup, at my school i put on the mask of a kid who cares for others but on the inside I don't care for myself sure I might have a smile all day but it's not real and frankly I'm to good at it.

 Ok 




 Thanks! 



















 Thanks 




 Ok I see it now, should be an easy fix 









 That's rude,good or not I still put time into it and I am still striving to improve. Art is like driving, some go faster than others. So thank you for the motivation to improve your the reason my arts just going to get better. 




 Thanks:)

 100% cuteness  




 I guess  




 I don't want to put that stress on them though. 




 I'm just getting bad again I don't want to tell my family cause I feel like a burden for how many times Iv had a relapse of sadness and I just don't want them to know I'd rather have them think I'm ok.i don't feel suicidal at all, I feel so alone I feel like iv got no one the only people I really talk to is my family. 
























 Those were werewolves. 









 Thanks! 
























 No problem  




 You know what else is rude ...reality  









 Touché I'm still learning and your advice really opened my eyes. 




 But I do get what your saying 




 The picture next to it was just there from when I was working on it, no intentions of side by side. 














 If you look close there is a piece of wood in his hand and if you look at the far right there is a fire so could be someone op knows.

 Well it's supernatural not that far fetched if dean became an angel  
























 My freshman grades and sophomore grade are total shit cause that's when I was at my lowest point but honestly is high school important?  




 Welcome to Wisconsin  




 Oh, well that sucks? 









 This brought a smile to my face that's been missing for a while. Thank you :)  




 Iv noticed that when my depression gets bad my drawings tend to, well really suck and I wanted to know if that's just me or does anyone else experience that. My art teacher said she saw major improvement in my drawing/drawings in the last semester and a half.  




 That's awesome !! 




 Trippy I like it! 




 You have some good there!  




 The face seems a bit small but great job you can only get better from here with practice and hard work 




 That's pretty cool !! 




 Good work ! Keep up the progress ! 




 The hamster dance scene gets me every time thanks for posting this!. 




 But I can see the confusion I'm happy I lost 10lbs 




 I think you posted to the wrong post in trying to lose weight not gain it 




 Lost 10 lbs anyway to keep the motivation? How do you motivate yourself? How do you deal with the people that mock you? 




 Also ways I fixed my diet was... 

*lunch I have loads of fruit, gives me some of that natural energy to push me through the rest of the day.

*morning is my protein based meal like egg whites ,peanut butter on whole wheat

*dinner is more of my veggies mostly green one which are the one I like the most haha maybe a portion of chicken or lean stake (size of your palm).

*snacks I mainly just eat fruits maybe some string cheese, low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt.
 




 Yeah that's the hardest part being healthy is 80% nutrition and 20% fitness .Well if you ever need to talk just pm me  




 Alright, Alright, Alright 




 That's what I thought when I first heard about it but I gave it a try just to see what it was all about and iv just been getting good results and setting new goals.The shakes are basically a Healthy meal replacement. 




 That shit is the best !!! (Melatonin) 




 Don't start all at once and over whelm yourself. At first make little changes like for example have a salad for lunch or start walking everyday even something as simple as drinking 8 cups of water a day. 




 Iv lost 10 lbs using those herbalife shakes and exercising regularly. And just wanted to know if anyone else got good results from herbalife. 




 I am not try to do anything though like seriously I lost 10 lbs using herbalife and got good results just wanted to see if others did to, no need to be so aggressive. 




 I have no idea 




 I'm actually down 10 lbs using it. 




 Just interested if anyone does and how you like their products or not? 




 It's a joke as to say the teacher was teaching them wrong so the grammars wron ... Turn it down a notch  




 I'm pretty sure saying diagnosed with depression is the right way to put it since it's a mental illness/mental disease same as anxiety. 




 You need to work on proportions Im saying this in the nicest way possible. But looks good keep up the good work you can only get better! 




 Love the emotion in his face !! 




 Thanks 




 Just get out more don't seclude yourself to one are by yourself it no good for you I know from experience. 




 It also says to reveal then it says that part so maybe 




 Neat ! 









 I don't want to make it just like the picture gotta have some diversity.but I see what you're saying 




 [Here](http://i.imgur.com/7wlOfs5l.jpg) it is but I think I just need to make the eyebrows more pronounced  




 Haha 




 Derek is the only one who looks awesome as a full on werewolf like for [example] (http://i.imgur.com/4DKq8Vv.png) 




 Thanks and I'll try the eyes thing,cause I'm redoing it on better paper ment for drawing. 









 I later realized that  




 I know right! 









 Except for the fact that's when stiles had the buzz cut  














 Haha she is a babe 




 Kanima is a red election of who you are on the inside  




 Oh yeah  




 I see what your saying now 




 Derek fought it away   




 He feeds off that so if that was the case that would make no sense  




 That was the kanima  




 Looks like she's going to go after hunters 




 Which proportions are off just wondering  




 But I like the were jaguar thing more but how do u become a jaguar from being turned from a wolf  




 She could be jokeing as to what she looks like as it. And a like i said in the post "though later legend and folklore depicts revenants as returning for a specific purpose (e.g., revenge against the deceased's killer)" so that might be the reason she came back as a revenant/were-jaguar  




 That was for like full body drawings though 




 I'm confused on what you mean by gesture ? 




 You never know. And if your throat was slit it would take a matter of seconds to die so I don't think the wolf healing ability works that fast. 




 You never know. 









 But berzerkers are just pure savage nature no thought process at all (that's what mr.argent said) 




 His eyes are suppose to have dark rings  




 I think that was the nogitsune playing tricks. Or it was because they had the doors to their minds open and it think they closed them 




 (Kate)
she's a werewolf but she is also A revenant(is a visible ghost or animated corpse that was believed to return from the grave to terrorize the living.)Though later legend and folklore depicts revenants as returning for a specific purpose (e.g., revenge against the deceased's killer)...Peter? Any thoughts?

 I'll get to it 




 Just watch the episode most of them ran, not all monsters are bad. 




 But does evolution apply to the supernatural world?  




 Most of the monsters ran they didn't stay and fight

 Once I saw the clawed guy I was like deans going to mention Freddy Kruger  




 I liked bloodlines and stand behind it same as Jared and Misha. I feel like they could do allot with it, but the one thing I didn't like was the main hunter character kind of looked like drake but he was interesting and I felt he played his character well this is just my opinion and everyone has their own. 




 I really liked this episode and could stand behind this spin off I think it's going to be a success. 




 I liked it !  




 Probably a stupid question but how do you get those supernatural qoutes by your username when you comment?
