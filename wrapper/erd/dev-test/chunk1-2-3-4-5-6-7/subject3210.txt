 A metric fuck ton of nope.  




 Awesome story. Very creepy and I am definitely looking forward to the update. My only complaint is when you said 'my brother and I'. Every time I read it my eyeball twitched. I can't be the only one.  




 *internets 




 Got any weed on ya?
You'd be a lot cewler if you did.  





























 What's the story? 




 This is great. This needs to be a movie.  




 These comments are all focused on the animals. I'm sure she cares about the dog and cat more than any of us. They'll be straight. Dat update doe??!!!? 




 So I read your story then I read the other dudes story. Now I keep seeing oranges. There were two punk ass oranges in the street that I saw while driving home. There was a mark ass orange out front of my house. I'm going to throw away the jive ass oranges we have in the kitchen then I'm going to my moms.  




 WHATS IN THE BOX?!!!? 
























 Keeping your brain occupied.... Or Xanax  




 Where do you find this work of art? 




 Fapternal* 




 Double cream is in 2 creams or is it like a heavier cream?? Cuz I wanna do that to my next coffee.  




 Verbed the shit outa that bitch ass noun.  
























 It doesn't seem like there's a way out of this. What ever this thing is, it seems like it's in you already. I would say lie at your next interview but I don't think that would help. Keep us posted. Good luck OP.  




 Reaching a little there bud? 




 Yeah he's cute. Till he sets out to become the dragon ninja then all bets are off.  




 Dang  




 Dude. I'd still smash the hot chick. Just give a fake name and don't let the bitch tie you down.  
























 Gavin? 




 We demand a shrubbery!! 




 You right you right. Took a bit to click but I can dig.  




 Dude.... Good luck op 




 You mentioned the hooves after the fact. The first time you brought up the moon lit carpet you didn't say anything about the hooves. Not saying this makes the story less believable but maybe a quick edit would make it easier to read. I had to back track when you mentioned the hooves to see if you said anything about them earlier and it kinda threw off the flow if only for a sec.  
























 Where you from OP? Your lingo sounds like you're from my neck of the woods.  




 The feeling of being watched is not a sense. It is not observed by any sensory organs. That's like saying sense of humor is a sense.  




 I don't like you anymore.  




 Good luck OP 




 You're confusing sensation with senses. We have 5 senses that gather billions of sensations and retain that knowledge. You know where your limbs are when you can't see them because through your sense of touch you've learned that if you don't keep track of them, you will get hurt.  
























 Nah yo. Old bay isn't that chunky.  




 Canada ey? Baltimore here. Wanna be friends? 




 I'm just gunna leave this here. http://www.pappascrabcakes.com/Main/index.asp 




 We have a restaurant in my area that has the best crab cakes and I'm pretty sure they will ship them anywhere. Place called Pappas.  




 Most of the world will never know how awesome a Maryland style crab cookout is. It's a damn shame.
