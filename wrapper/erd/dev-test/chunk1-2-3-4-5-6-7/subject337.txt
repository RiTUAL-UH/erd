 This is incredible! 




 Kipper. I loved his super grown-up British accent. 




 OMG I LOVE THIS SHOW!!! I would probably still watch it today if I could find it. 




 Wait. Lego LoTR is for kids?

 At first I thought he was standing backwards over his bike. 




 I came here to say there's a good pun in here somewhere. This was it. Thanks, redditor. 




 TIL the meaning of the word "scause". 




 Been in that sub now for an hour. Thanks. 




 Good lord. 




 Thanks for being the source of my internet failure this morning, OP. 




 It took me a good minute to figure out what was going on here. 




 I saw this while laying in bed last night and immediately regretted my decision to be on reddit at 3am. 




 I made myself a busy person. Job, school, two companies, significant other, friends who will still come back if I ignore them for a while. I only really get bored on the weekends when I'm trying my best to ignore my work email. 




 OP what are you, gender-wise?

I only date men, but I'm attracted to other women almost as equally. 




 "If you were a true psychopath you wouldn't ever admit it"
or
"You can't be a sociopath because you do xyz-thing-that-normal-people-do"

Bitch shut the fuck up. It took me years of therapy to be able to admit it and start doing normal things and unless you have an advanced degree in abnormal psychology, I don't want to hear your opinionated "facts" about what ASPD/psychopathy is or is not. 




 Can we please go back to this tradition? 




 I-95 south to 295 south, then went the wrong way on 64. Apparently 64 and 295 meet up more than once? 295 always confuses me because I always seem to be taking 295 south, regardless of which way I'm traveling. 




 I have 600+ hours in the Elder Scrolls series. 




 It's a drive I've done a few times, so I didn't bother with the GPS. I was running on maybe 6 or 7 hours of sleep since Friday morning, and had worked 37 hours over the course of two and a half days, so my brain was not anywhere near working properly. 




 I just drove home from an extremely exhausting weekend event. This was suppose to be a four hour drive, and it turned into nearly six and a half, with no stops and no traffic.

I get on the highway to go home, heading south. About 45 minutes in there is a junction and I can either take I-64 East or I-64 West. In my exhausted state, it somehow makes sense for me to go east. I'll note here that I live in southwest VA. So I'm driving along and I see a sign that tells me VA Beach is around 65 miles away or something like that. That should have been my first clue. But instead of wondering why I'm being told how far away VA Beach is when I'm suppose to be traveling away from it, I think "Oh cool I'm close to VA Beach, maybe I'll stop there!" And I keep driving. **For an hour.** Finally, I see a sign about the infamous bridge-tunnel, and that's when the red flags start going up in my head. I very slowly realized my mistake. It was not a good realization. I was already exhausted and just wanted to be home, and I'd just added two hours, at least, to my trip. Also wasted a quarter tank of gas. I angrily turned around and made my way home.

tl;dr Went the wrong direction on the highway, didn't realize for an hour. 




 Example: boyfriend texts me to go pick him up. I'm sitting on reddit writing a particularly lengthy comment. I text him back with a lie, saying that I was finishing up a work email and would be on my way in a minute. I didn't even think about it; I just said it.

Anyone else lie about the most asinine things for no reason at all? 




 I usually become suspicious of somewhen when I notice their reactions to things. I think a huge tell (and one that's really hard for me to fake) is the reaction to a bad situation. Example: my friend left my apt the other night, I immediately got into bed because I was exhausted. Friend knocks on door and says car has been towed. I'm just like "well that sucks. Goodnight". I assume normal people would want to help or something. I got called out on that. So if I see someone have a reaction like that when they should be more engaged, it throws a flag. Then I observe their other behavior and figure out if I think they are part of the 1% or if they just have trouble dealing with certain situations.

Also ITT: "let's argue about how many psychopaths we may or may not come in contact with." C'mon guys, we've been doing so well lately. The reality of it is this: the best guess that science can give is that 1% of the population suffers from some severity of ASPD. That's 1 in 100 people. In a typical day you will probably come into contact with more than 100 people, assuming you do things like go to lunch at a restaurant or work in a building with other people or walk around a college campus, etc. I think the more valid point is that you don't directly interact with over 100 people a day. So while the likelihood of you being in close proximity with a psychopath is not terribly low, the chances of you actually befriending one is slim. 




 It's less mood and more preference. I hate the cold. I hate the rain. I want it to be 75ºF and sunny at all times. When it deviates from that I don't like it. It doesn't change my mood though. 




 You're literally just naming suicide missions. 




 **This is the greatest story I've ever seen in this sub.**

I'm usually the bitch who's guilty of sweater-stealing (I think I have three that belong to the boyfriend right now), and I'm assuming she's not a psychopath, so I have nothing good to offer.

Please keep us updated on how this turns out. 









 The article cuts off the reason why the people who beat up the gay couple can't be charged with a hate crime. Anyone know the reason?

 Yep, pretty much this. 









 Hi all. New to the sub. I've never actually been involved in any migraine help community and I don't actually know anyone else who is afflicted.

I've been having weekly migraines since I was a teenager. I read a lot about going into a dark, quiet room and laying down, but that never seems to make a difference. I noticed a while back though that I seem to be temperature sensitive. During the migraine, I go through hot and cold changes. One minute I'll be burning up and having cold sweats and then the next I'll be shivering, like the cold is coming from the inside and no amount of sweatshirt or blanket can make me warm..

Also, laying down makes everything worse. I find that the pain is most manageable when I'm standing or walking around. I spend a lot of time pacing the floor.

Do these things happen to anyone else? Any opinions or tales from experience? Dunno if it's helpful or not, but I'm on sumatriptan 50mg. 




 We see it all the time. Someone tapping their foot or fingers to the music in their car, or even music in the doctor's office waiting room. Why is that? 




 Here's the background: for as long as I can remember (at least as young as 10 years old) my ears have felt clogged up. I try to yawn or move my jaw around or hold my nose while blowing to try and get them to pop, but they won't. Sometimes I have autophony. When I try to make them pop, I just hear some crackling, like they're trying to, but the pressure won't equalize. I can't go under 5-6 feet of water without it being excruciating because the pressure won't equalize. Oddly, I have zero problems with flying. It's extremely uncomfortable and I just want my ears to be normal. I've had hearing tests done and I have no loss of hearing. They've tested the pressure behind my eardrum and found it to be normal.

I've been to 4 ENTs. The first 2 told me I had allergies and told me to take daily Claritin and stay indoors. Tried daily allergy meds for a few months with no change. Staying indoors is not an option. I've never had allergy problems in my life, but I was willing to give anything a go. After that didn't work, ENT told me I would just have to live with it. Third ENT told me the same thing.

Fourth ENT was the first to actually try real solutions, and even though he couldn't fix me, I still thank him enormously for trying. He put me on two months of steroid nasal spray. When that did nothing, we decided to undergo the placement of tubes in my ears. I had that surgery three weeks ago. There is still no change. At my follow-up yesterday he has now told me there's nothing else to be done. He says sometimes the nerves send a signal of fullness to the brain so that it feels congested when it's really not. I can't accept this, because then the water depth wouldn't be an issue and I wouldn't get that crackling sound when I move my jaw around. Also, the autophony probably would not be an issue if it was just pesky nerves.

reddit, there must be something to be done. The congestion makes me want to stab holes in the side of my face as if that would help relieve it, and it feels like this all day, every day, for the past 15 years at least. I will answer any questions that may help solve this mystery.

Please help! 
























 I have both a MBA and a MBP. I need to transfer the same set of files to 250 USB drives. I've been doing Google searches for good software to complete this, and everything I've found is either Windows only, or it's designed for hard drive back-ups. Any software suggestions? Thanks! 
























 I use the two-finger trackpad gesture to go to the previous web page (quick for looking at pictures and such). Worked fine for the three weeks I've had this laptop. Installed RES 10 minutes ago and now it's not working. It causes Safari to freeze the current web page. The program itself works fine, other tabs that are open are not affected, but the tab that I'm in to try to swipe back freezes, regardless of if it is reddit or not. When it freezes, it moves maybe 10 pixels to the right, as if it's started to swipe back, and then sticks there and becomes unresponsive. I'm unable to open a new tab or navigate away from the current page. If it's the only tab open I have to restart Safari. I am able to close out of the affected tab.

 I'm in the States. I have a tiny portfolio, partly because I can't really share the stuff I've done for the company I work for. I do front-end development/design work. I specialize in HTML5 and CSS3, with some jQuery thrown in for things I can't accomplish in CSS. I can do enough PHP for an email contact form. I would like to do personal/resume websites or small business pages, mainly static pages, but any opportunity I can take to help build a good portfolio would be appreciated.

 I'm creating a video in iMovie 10 that needs to play as portrait on an iPhone 5. I can't find a way to make the video the correct size/aspect ratio. It needs to be 9:16 (I'm pretty sure). I really would just like to be able to crop the sides off the picture. Any advice or help? TIA. 




 My boss has tasked me with doing video editing, and seeing as I'm a programmer, I have zero clue about what I'm doing. I've watched enough YouTube tutorials to know how the software works, but now I'm getting into the content and I'm lost.

There is around 30 minutes of work-out video and I need to cut it down to a 30-ish second preview. There is only one camera angle, and it's relatively wide. I have no control over filming; I just get the finished videos handed to me from above.

There are over 20 series' I need to do this for. I'm using iMovie 10.0.3 on a MacBook Air.

What should I be looking to pull into a preview? Just playing around with the first series I managed 23 seconds, including a 4 second title. I just took a few seconds here and there showing different movements and with the trainer saying motivating or explanatory things, and crossfaded them together. Now I'm stuck on how to end it, and I really don't think the current 23 seconds that I have is any good. This is content that will be pushed to clients, so I need it to be at least halfway decent.

Everything I find by doing a Google search relates to movie editing and things with different camera angles and lots of dialogue and none of it is relevant. Any tips or advice is much needed and greatly appreciated. 




 "“A lot of doctors and other mental health professionals just throw up their arms, and say, ‘What’s the point of even identifying antisocial personality disorder? What are we going to do with these people?’” said Donald W. Black, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City."

Not even the mental health professionals know what to do with us.

Also, that is the longest name of a university department college I have ever seen.

[Article here](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/04/06/surprising-myths-facts-about-antisocial-personality-disorder/)
It's an article titled "Surprising Myths  Facts About ASPD". I'm not sure if the article is worth the read, mainly because I doubt the validity of some of the data. Maybe worth a skim through. 





























 I'm not a particularly active person, but I'm not out of shape by any means. I do this thing every now and then where I'll run a mile and some every day or two, over the course of maybe a week, and then I stop for a month (or three). Is there any actual long-term benefit to doing this? I lack motivation to get into a runner's habit (working on that) and every now and then I get on a running kick. To put it in perspective, I use the Nike Run app and it tells me I've only run 11 miles so far this year. I tried to find some article to post, but no luck. 




 I'm pretty drunk. Thank god for autocorrect. I also just discovered video Snapchat so I think all my friends will either hate me, or be very amused, in the morning.

That is all.

Goodnight Reddit. I'm off to drink another bottle of wine. 




 I've done some reading but have yet to find any good research done on the observed differences in how ASPD presents in each gender. I know it's much more prevalent in men, so most of what I can find online is from the male perspective. What differences, if any, have you noticed when working with ASPD patients of both genders? 




 There have been a few embedded discussions here recently relating to the difference between men and women with ASPD. I've been doing some reading in a few psych medical journals to try and find some concrete research on it, but the majority of the studies use prison inmates. I have found that the current statistics are estimated at there being 1 woman diagnosed for every 3 men.

Has anyone done any research you can share? Or what have you guys observed if you know any ASPD people of the opposite gender? I know we have at least one other active female member on here who I'd like to hear from.

Edit** More info

I posted this over in /r/psychotherapy as well, to see what the therapists and psychology professionals had to contribute. One person said he/she noticed that men usually acted alone, where women usually had an equally antisocial male counterpart. Found that interesting. 




 Slow internet at work, so this is every single one for me. I feel like it takes away from the (supposed) awesomeness to see it before it's fully loaded. 




 I ask because I went to VA Tech and today is the 7th anniversary of the shooting. I went to high school with the shooter and two of the girls who were killed, one of which I knew decently. Because of those things, I always have some semblance of an emotional response to this day, although I can't figure out what it is. Sadness maybe? Remnants of what that day was like? I don't know. My emotional palate is small. Regardless, it's a day I stay away from people because everyone is emotional and doing that whole "we're part of something greater" community thing and I can't stand it. Some people a few years ago wanted me to go to the candlelight vigil at midnight, so I did. I spent the whole time reading everyone else's faces. It was people-watching gold.

I also have the unpopular opinion that 33 Hokies died that day, because I include the shooter in the death count. I said this to one person, once, and will never make that mistake again.

But other shootings and violent acts/natural disasters, I don't feel anything for at all. Boston Marathon, Sandy Hook, hurricanes destroying cities, etc. I have that attitude of, "well, that happened" and I barely give it a second thought. 









 I have a very small, old dog. I've found that I can just feed it and walk it and it doesn't require any attention other than that because he just lazes around the house all day. It's nice because he's barely there, so I haven't had an opportunity to really get bored with it, and he doesn't bother me. It's like having a moving piece of furniture that I have to buy food for.

It should be noted I suppose that I haven't had the desire to harm animals since I was young. People, yes, but I like animals. 




 These are happening naturally.

My first one was about a month ago. I was drifting off, and then my body felt like it was buzzing. It got so intense I could hardly stand it. I assume I entered the dream state at some point while the buzzing was going on because all at once the buzzing stopped and I was floating off of my bed, toward the ceiling. I know it wasn't an OBE because I looked down at the bed and my body wasn't there. I floated until I bumped into the ceiling. I was terrified and mustered all of my strength and screamed, which took me out of the dream. My roommate later told me that he'd heard me scream. I was so scared by what had happened that I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. Instead, I stayed up and researched as much as I could about lucid dreaming.

I was afraid to have another one through the following nights, but enough time passed that I stopped worrying about it, and I wrote it off as a one-time freak occurrence.

Until last night. I was drifting off and felt the buzzing again. Instead of being scared I tried to focus on it. Next I knew, I was floating around and out of my (closed) bedroom window. I dreamed I was exploring a little historical town. I was playing around with running and floating, and just controlling myself in general. The dream was so vivid. Normal dreams for me are blurry, or hazy, but this one was crystal clear, like I was really there on a bright sunny day. I could look around and go where I wanted. It was devoid of other people tho, or any action. It was just a little empty town, and me learning how to control my dream self.

I also noticed that I was aware of what my physical body was doing. I realized in the dream that I could float if I got a running start and kicked my legs, like swimming. I could feel my physical body moving my legs while I was doing that. Or if I turned my head to look at something, I knew my actual head was turning too. It almost felt like a part of me was caught between asleep and awake.

It lasted maybe ten minutes. I came out of it suddenly when I heard someone whisper "hey" in my ear and it sounded like it was whispered into my actual ear, and not my dream-self ear. (Note that I sleep alone.)

I'm very freaked out by the whole experience. I have done some research and looked through r/luciddreaming and noticed that a lot of you do this intentionally. Is it uncommon for it to happen naturally? Any advice as far as controlling it or dealing with it? Is my experience in line with a typical lucid dream? It's a frightening experience for me and any words of wisdom are appreciated.

tl;dr: Started having LD naturally. Freaked out. Help.

 Moves. It's tracks your movement in the background and tells you how many steps you've walked, run, cycled, and driven. Works both with internal accelerometer and GPS, so it works just as well walking around town as it does on the treadmill. It gives you a map of all the places you went and you can tag them (it recognizes businesses, and you can save your home, work, etc). It's nice to see at the end of the day what my normal activity was. I went to an amusement park a few weeks ago and found that I walked a total of 7 miles just walking around the park. It's also very helpful when you were drunk downtown the night before and don't remember which bar you left your tab open at.

 I use SwiftKey on my iPhone. Love it. I mainly like the dark keyboard. 




 Totally agree with all of this. I pay the $10 for Spotify Premium because it gives me access to 99.9% of the songs I would want to listen to, on my phone at all times. It allows me to not have to load my 30+ GB of music onto my phone too, so it's a major storage saver.

Also, the premade Spotify playlists are on point, and the radio is way better than Pandora IMO.

 Music of life*

Silence, my brother. 




 I'm a developer but I need a second one. The issue where I am is that the companies can't even find developers to work for salary, so finding someone who will reliably work for free or even pay into a startup is next to impossible. My area is full of investors and coworking spaces and everything else a startup would need to succeed, but extremely lacking in people wanting to join startups.

I know what you mean though with business people looking for devs for their ideas though. I had someone hit me up once with his idea, which I though was good but not interesting to me personally, but he pretty much asked me to build the whole thing. 




 That would be a helluva lot easier if we didn't live hours apart. I try to get up there as often as I can. I do my best to talk to him and he seems to feel comfortable coming to me when he has an issue or when mother has done something, so that makes me feel better. 




 If I could take my brother in to live with me, it would make me a million times happier, but there is zero chance of that happening. I'd have a better chance of convincing my mom's husband that my brother is in a bad situation and that they need to get out. My step-dad is so easy-going though that he just deals with her shit without seeing how bad it is. 




 Thanks for the input! I've been trying to keep a good line of conversation open with my brother (we live far away from each other) and make him understand that he needs to do his best to not let the things our mother says and does get to him. 




 That's what I was afraid of. She reacts extremely defensively to any and all criticism. 




 Hi all. I'm new to this sub. Someone over in /r/sociopath said I should check it out. I am 100% convinced my mother has NPD; I won't go into the details this time. As a result, I've been diagnosed and stuck with ASPD.

My question is related to getting her the help she needs. I'm in my 20s and have been on my own for years now, so I can just ignore her, but I worry about my kid brother. He's 14 and he's already starting to show the traits for ASPD or other empathy-based personality disorders, and I'm convinced it's because of him growing up with our mother. I don't want to see that happen to him.

Has anyone been successful in getting help for their narcissistic parents? Unfortunately, she's been successful in turning most of the family against anything I have to say, and my diagnosis reinforced that within my family. I'm unsure of how to bring it up with any family members without them telling me I'm crazy or overreacting or something of the sorts. I just really want her to get better so she doesn't fuck up my brother for life. 




 Am I the only one who thought that was an elephant? 




 Precipice has always been one of my favorite words to say.

 Hi. I've recently been involved with Startup Weekend and formed a team, but it fell apart after the event (as many are apt to do). Since then I've been attempting to find founders to make this a thing, with no luck. How did you find people who wanted to work for/with you and who were actually willing to put in a serious amount of commitment? 




 That convo goes like this:

"What are you up to?"

"Nothing"

"Oh cool, let's go do xyzthingIdon'twanttodo"

"No, you misunderstand. I'm doing nothing. Leave me be." 




 Netflix. 




 This makes me uncomfortable. 




 I just want to point out that this is not an issue only affecting big cities. I live in a small town with relatively decent people and it still happens. Not nearly as often as this video portrays, maybe once a week or so, but it's still an issue and it still makes walking around downtown uncomfortable sometimes. I can imagine this is happening in every town all over the country. Thanks OP for the post and raising awareness. 




 Does dogecoin mine off the graphics card like BTC? I have a spare Macbook but I assume I can't mine with that. I'm prepared to buy a computer solely for mining. What should I be considering before making this purchase? Thanks! 




 Oh shit. I'm still on 1.4. That might explain it. This is what I get for not keeping up with things. Sigh. Thanks! 




 My dogecoin wallet has been syncing for close to six months. I thought maybe it was slow internet, so I moved the computer to my office, which is gigabit, and it's still syncing. I've left it alone for three months and it's still going. Please help! 




 Why are fat people offended when we call them out on being fat? I don't get offended when someone tells me I'm short. Jeez.

 Thank you so much for doing this! I was actually in Harry Potter World in Florida over the weekend, so coming home to an AMA by you is great!

So many questions for you already, I hope you get to mine.

Harry Potter was such an integral part of my growing up, and I'm among the many many 20-somethings that followed the series from the first three books and on. As a fan, when the credits rolled on the Deathly Hollows Part 2, the feeling of "it's all over" was overwhelming. How was it for you when the last movie was finished and the series came to an end? 




 I'm sorry but the fact that you said "prolly" instead of "probably" just made my year. 




 I try to be normal in a relationship. I think being open with the other person about my antisocial traits helps that happen. I slip up sometimes. 




 Empathy is when something happens to a person and you feel bad for them or feel what they are feeling. Things happen to other people, even people close to me, and I feel nothing. This doesn't mean I don't care about them. 




 Why would not find things funny? 




 I mainly only sleep with men (I'm female), but I wouldn't be opposed to being with a woman. 




 Therapy got me to be self-aware and the help stopped there. 




 Web design. 




 As I walk slowly back to the car I think: I hope it does.

My favorite line in the whole thing. 




 How old are you? 




 In my state you could lose your gun rights, but that's the only negative I know of. It's also very expensive. It's not like a prison where you don't have to pay for it. It gets billed to your medical insurance and you could end up with a very large bill. 




 In women, borderline and ASPD get confused for each other. 




 I've never cheated. I'm actually extremely loyal in relationships although I imagine I could hide an affair with little to no effort and be successful in it. 




 I don't say "bye" on the phone. I just hang up. In person I hate when my friends want to do the whole 'let's hug goodbye' thing and I'm all, 'I'm gonna see you again in less than 24 hours, why are you acting like I'm going away forever?' 









 This should be the norm. 




 This is my favorite riddle to ask people. Glad to see it on here! 




 It's OK. I'm also 25, with the misfortune of living in a college town. The young people trends are horrendous and make me feel super old. 




 Oh great. It's a yik yak of a joke that's probably from reddit originally. We've come full circle people. 




 Woah, did you just finish Journey? 




 I'm 5'2", so yes I could be a very tall hobbit. I'd be ok with that. 




 Not trolling, and way to only discount a portion of what I said. At the time this article was written, the CDC was still saying we weren't going to get it in the US at all. The operative phrase in your post is "so far". Just one confirmed case is still a start to them happening more and more here. Ebola has an average infection rate of 3 people per infected person, and with an incubation period of up to 21 days, the possibilities are at least mildly troubling.

In a fast-building story like the Ebola coverage is, an article published two weeks ago, let alone two months ago, like this one, is irrelevant.

Do your research. 




 I think self-diagnosis would take hours of research (actual, medical journal research) and an extremely objective look at yourself. 




 I dream every night, and very vividly. Sometimes I lucid dream. 




 What you're saying makes a lot of sense. It's more of a possession thing. When I have someone like that I'll try not to hurt them because I wouldn't want them to leave and not be mine anymore. 




 That's actually the reddit tagline. When the founders were tasked with creating reddit, they were literally told to create "The front page of the internet"

 Not as pricey as some others on here, but once I put my then-bf's Corvette key fob through the washing machine. Ruined it. Cost $250 to replace. He didn't speak to me for a couple of days. 




 Sometimes I eat lunch right before someone invites me to lunch somewhere else. So I eat a second lunch. But I can't just go and sit there and eat a snack. I have to make it look like I was super hungry still, so I eat two full lunches and then want to kill myself and my food baby.

 I'm a self-aware female ASPD person as well, so this is more of a comparison thing.

Being that you're aware of the issue and how it makes you act/feel in society and in personal relationships, are you trying to get better? You say you're seeing a psychologist; do you see a therapist for CBT or anything? I've found that I'm extremely frustrated not having the capacity to have normal human interactions and I'm wondering if you experience the same frustrations. 




 Can you help me to understand why you think this way? The dog gets fed and watered and walked and taken to the vet if he's ill. I don't harm him. I just don't pay attention to him other than his necessary needs. So why am I am awful person? 




 Well played, OP. Well played. 









 Dude, every time a guy finds out I'm a redditor, question #1: "haha, yeah, how much of that is on r/gonewild?" Um, none of it. Fuck.

 “Three of the four elements are shared by all creatures, but fire was a gift to humans alone. Smoking cigarettes is as intimate as we can become with fire without immediate excruciation. Every smoker is an embodiment of Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and bringing it on back home. We smoke to capture the power of the sun, to pacify Hell, to identify with the primordial spark, to feed on them arrow of the volcano. It's not the tobacco we're after but the fire. When we smoke, we are performing a version of the fire dance, a ritual as ancient as lightning.”

 Ooh thanks for the explanation. English is my only language and I still didn't get it. Maybe I'm just being slow today. 




 I was a 17 year old girl at one point in my life. What the top commenters are saying about trying to talk to her about it without being too harsh or threatening to punish sounds like it would be the most effective. I'm sure most of us can remember a time when we were in our late teens and our parents trying to punish us was more of a joke than anything else. At 17, she's nearly an adult, and while she will obviously still be under your rules at home, she will see herself as and want to be treated as an adult. You also sound like you understand that concept of letting her form into her own person as well and I commend you for that. Remind her that she could end up in serious trouble if she's doing illegal things. It sounds like she's a smart kid with good schooling and possibly college aspirations so a firm reminder about not messing that up could potentially go a long way. 




 I'm here after reading this on the front page, and I have to completely agree with you. I am a hardcore grilled cheese lover, and can't stand it when people put other things on the sandwich.

 I decided to take Java in high school to satisfy the my fourth math class needed for my advanced diploma. Figured it would just be a BS class I'd get through and never think about again. Ended up going to college for computer science and now I'm a web developer. 









 Wait what happens if you plant a perfect apple? Do you get a perfect apple tree? 




 Don't eat it. It's poisonous.

 I like your idea here. Even if it looked like a continuity error, or simply was an error, I think the possible subtle meaning here is really cool.

 Can we please talk about why there are children in a fire pit? 




 After being taken care of by humans, are they more friendly toward people as a result? Does anyone have any in a personal bat house or anything, like pets? 




 Bats fixed for frying... Pretty messed up children's book... I like it. 




 I want a pet bat so bad. Seeing this makes me want one even more. They are so adorable!

 I started like three weeks ago and have gotten pretty far. They do a good job of making sure the new players don't get drowned out by the people who have been playing for a while. 




 I did it too. My clanmates were all "what's that red thing on your th?" Support (Product)^RED ! 




 It was one of those "since you're here..." and admittedly I didn't feel like going all the way home, and extra hours and shit. 




 "Hey do you want to grab a drink sometime?" I don't understand the whole dropping hints and waiting for him to figure it out mindset. Men are mostly stupid on the subject of woman hints. If you're interested in a guy, go get him.

 You mean to tell me that I'm not looking at a picture of a panda? I don't believe you OP. 




 This. This is fucking great. 




 You're not the only one. My mom didn't talk about it at all, so when certain puberty things happened that I should have made her aware of, I hid it because I thought it was weird and reason for judgement. 




 I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but what is bv? ^I ^feel ^like ^I ^should ^know ^this... 




 I'm still blown away by the fact that people gave her money after she left her kids in the car. Seriously, what the fuck? 




 How are you people seeing these things?? Legit staring at the thumbnail now trying to figure this out. 




 I'm not sure how I feel about this. 




 Well, time to go order a few things from Amazon. 




 Happened to me. Am woman. Can confirm.

Dated a guy once for about two months who told me he had a propensity for sticking his dick in crazy, and I was thinking, "ok, well I'm relatively normal, so it should be good." Nope. He turned out to be the most arrogant, self-centered person I'd ever met and it was simply impossible to please him. Any opinion or idea that differed from his was considered "crazy". Dropped that like a hot potato. Ended with me telling him "maybe you're the problem." 




 Guys! We've come so far for equality! Why you gotta start fighting about it now? 




 Can you please elaborate on this so I can decide if it's worth it to put you back in your place? 




 Hold on. 3 sexual partners? I know this has been beaten into the ground ITT already, but damn. Seeing this must have transformed me into a basic bitch because I can no longer even. 




  he isn't adopted

That you know of... Unless you're the mother, and then there's a higher probability of you being sure it's yours. 




 How does that have any relevance? 




 My first question for you, after looking at your website, is: how are you different than sites like Trello or Basecamp? There are tons of collaboration tools out there. I would highlight what makes yours different/better than the rest, or what makes it better for your target audience. I think the customer inclusion is probably a big thing. Also, the x leads to y, y leads to z thing you have going on in the pitch lost me a little. 




 What was your previous programming experience like, before developing this (languages, etc)? You say you are a software dev, but had you worked with mobile dev before this? 




 I'm a tummy sleeper too. My chiropractor tells me it's bad for your spine and neck. I can't fall asleep any other way though. 




 I don't think that's a note. That looks like a message for the bathtub. One of those info plaques that hotels like to put everywhere because normal people don't know how water works. 




 They... threw them away? That hurts. 




 It's a bell curve, and the peak is at that mohawk. 




 I was taught to let hydrogen peroxide sit in your ears until the fizzing stops and then let it drain out. Not sure if it does anything, but my parents used to make me do it when I was a kid. 




 I once lost points on a writing assignment because I wrote "per cent" instead of "percent". Questioned teacher, because family is British, teacher says "because America (paraphrased)." 




 I sometimes press the button as I'm walking past it, and then continue down the street without crossing. And the ones here are the ones that talk, so it yells "WAIT" every time you press the button.

 Was Frederick county bad too? I'm pretty sure it butts up next to or very close to Loudoun County, so I assume they got just as much snow. 




 I remember my junior or senior year in high school they purposefully added extra days off for Spring Break in case of too many snow days. That way they could make us come back early from break or something.

This state just doesn't know what to do with anything that falls from the sky.

 I'd be interested in being a mod too. I can think of some good ideas and directions for the sub.

 This. I used to work at a supermarket bakery and every day we would throw out food that had hit it's "Sell By" date. It was all cakes and bread loaves and bagels and the likes. This food was still good to be eaten for days. I tried to get the store to donate it to the homeless or shelters, and they said it was a health liability thing. I could see the issue being the same or similar for people who root it out the dumpster.

Didn't stop me from taking a bunch of that food home though. 




 Someone needs to call the guys over in /r/theydidthemath and figure out how many packs of cigarettes this is.

 He moved away a week ago. Since then, we've had one phone call that lasted about 10 minutes. I get maybe 1 text from him a day, if even that. I mentioned today that I've barely heard from him. He says he's been busy. I tell him it would be nice to hear from him more than once a week. I explain that I don't need to talk to him every single day, but I don't want us to become strangers because we never talk. We agreed to talk about it more tomorrow on the phone, as he's with his friends tonight.

It's only been a week and we're already fighting about the distance. If I'm going to only get to talk to him once a week, that's not enough for me. I know myself, and I know I need more than that. I'm hoping we can find a compromise. I'm hoping he has a good explanation.

Did anyone else experience this at the beginning? Is this a red flag for later on? Before he moved he had this attitude of "we'll make it" and "don't worry, we'll be fine" and all that. Now it's like he doesn't think that's the case anymore. If he cared and wanted it to work, wouldn't he be putting in more effort? He says he's been busy with his friends. Can't he find 15 minutes to get away and call me, or 30 seconds to send me a text message? Why am I feeling less important than the people he sees every day? I'm starting to think maybe he's not as serious about it.

I'm suppose to drive up to see him this coming Friday. 




 /r/thingsforants  




 I'm home alone. I didn't go to my family's this year. 




 The thought about juggling two lives has definitely crossed my mind. You know, never spending weekends with my friends here and whatnot. I suppose we will just have to take it as it comes and hope for the best! 




 Here's hoping :) 




 First of all, your post is making me tear up, because your situation sounds extremely similar to the one my boyfriend and I have just thrown ourselves into. We weren't together for as long beforehand, but he moved away as a career move and I stay here for mine. We are both extremely career oriented people and this is just how it has to be right now. I have too much going on here to be able to move right now, and he needs to be in a different location for his job. We're also about the same distance away as you and yours (about 4.5 hours), so saying that you get to see him nearly every other weekend makes me happy.

But the thing that really got me is your bullet point 4. SO said something like this to me the other day, before he left. He said that we're both such ambitious people that we have the potential to be an amazing power couple one day. But we have to work on getting there first. And if that means being apart and still together, then so be it. It's a bittersweet thing.

Thank you for the feels. I'm on day 1 of my LDR, so your post was very encouraging for me. 




 I don't wear makeup normally, so no I'm not equating the two. I don't feel that I need makeup to look or feel good about my appearance. And I just happen to like my body better when it's in-shape and looking healthy. Everyone should always strive to have the body they want, regardless of what that body type is. Be happy in your own skin. I'm happiest when I'm slender.

I don't see what's shallow about wanting my own body or appearance to be a certain way. I'm saying nothing about how I prefer anyone else's body. 




 OP, I'm waiting on delivery. 




 Hi all! I've been thinking about getting into flying for a while. I've lurked on this sub a bit, and watched plenty of YouTube videos with various copters, and learned about the parts of them and all that jazz. I decided to (kind of) take the plunge and asked for a quadcopter for Christmas. Well, I found out that I'm getting a Syma X5C. So I'm wondering, did you all start out by learning on a smaller, less expensive copter? How long before you felt you were ready to invest in a nicer one? How hard is it to actually get good at flying? Any wisdom you have to share with someone who's never flown anything remote control before?

Thanks!! 




 I have a feeling I'm about to be a more frequent poster in this sub.

First of all, thank you to all of you who offered kind words and encouragement on my last post. Yesterday was the day. He left my apartment and I immediately called my best friend who came over with wine and Christmas movies, which was awesome.

I feel like crying and throwing up. I barely slept last night, my appetite is all but gone, and I'm still doubting that I can even do the long distance thing. SO is so confident that everything will be fine and we'll make it, so I'm hoping his confidence will rub off on me in time, and I'll gain some better faith in myself.

I think what worries me the most is that the move is indefinite. I have a career where I am now, and he has no plans for returning. He's starting a career in this new location. How is it suppose to work if we have no plan of being reunited at some point in the future? 




 You don't know that she does any of these things for him. Maybe she keeps herself slim and attractive because she likes herself that way. Not all women look good in order to impress a man. Some of us just take pride in our appearance, regardless of anyone else's opinion on the matter.

 Not a garbage person, but the 20" monitor sitting on my desk at work was found next to my apartment dumpster. Works great.

 My bf is moving away this weekend. We haven't been together long, almost two months, but we've talked about it and we want to try to make it work. He's also not moving very far away, only about 4 hours. I've been pretending it's not happening and then this evening the whole thing just hit me like a bag of bricks and I broke down. I've never been in a LDR before and I have no idea how I'm going to deal with this. I don't know how I'm going to balance my life here with him being away. I feel like I'm going to lose all my friends because I'll be trying to visit him every weekend I can, or if he comes here I won't want to see anyone else. To me right now, it feels like a breakup. My best friend keeps telling me it will all be ok. Bf keeps reassuring me that we'll be fine, and I know deep down that we will be. I just don't know how, or how hard it's actually going to be to make it work.

Sorry I'm kind of venting right now, and my thoughts are all jumbled. I just needed to get this out and hopefully gain some insight into what I can expect, and maybe some advice to help me stop freaking out.

Thanks for reading. 




 All of that rant was unnecessary. I can't believe I actually read through the whole thing. 




 It always makes me think I'm mildly psychic. 




 When it dropped the second one it was so adorable, I lost it. 




 Well that's good! Keep getting yourself out there. You'll find a good group of people to stick with eventually. It took me a while too because I don't make friends easily. 




 Last movie I watched was Sabrina, so I guess I would be marrying Linus Larabee. So, married life would consist of me sitting around at the pool all day and not having to work because my husband is super rich. I'd be ok with that. 




 Have you checked out meetup.com? Not sure of your location, but if you're in the states, there are all kinds of meetup groups on that site. I host a group and we have random people show up sometimes and they like it and they become part of the group. 




 Well he texted me after I gave him my phone number, and then continued to text me and hang out with me. I think that was a big hint.

I know, most boring story here.

 Hi. I originally was planning to move in with roommates who already had an apartment secure and I wouldn't have to pay a deposit. But, I found a different apartment that is worlds better for me to live in (less rent, no roommates, only a block from work, etc). I need to sign the lease by the end of this week, but I don't get paid until Tuesday the 16th. Normally it wouldn't be an issue as I make a decent amount of money, but with Thanksgiving, my last paycheck was only half of what it normally is.

I will pay back as soon as my Dec 16th check goes in direct deposit (9am on the 16th), $350 or whatever amount is deemed appropriate. At this point, getting this apartment secured is more important than the money.

I'm in Blacksburg, VA, USA. I don't know how the members of this sub handle money transfers as this is my first time here, but I'd be willing to pay for overnight mailing of a money order, or whatever else is easiest.

 Sorry about your cousin. I was a senior in high school when the shooting happened and had many friends at VT. I lost one of them. All the people being mean ITT can suck a dick. This gesture means a lot for those who had their lives affected by that awful day.

 I would have been happy living my entire life without ever hearing the word "planogram" again. Dammit.

 I remember several years ago there was a story about a family of a particular religion painting a religious mural on their driveway to commemorate their son's coming of age. The HOA had a field day with fines and the like. Made it to the local news. I was probably 15 years old, and it made me furious even back then. 




 Someone had to say it. 




 I find when I read these kinds of things I don't actually know what each individual word is, but I understand the overall meaning.

 I thought that was a cat.

being an understatement. 




 I was 100% sure of never wanting kids before I started working with them. Still 100% sure. Working with kids has made me like them a little more, but definitely still not for me. 




 I use the Carrot apps. For anyone who's played Portal, it's like GLADoS but for being fit. It's awesome. Also, with the Health app (on iPhones, I don't know if Android has an equivalent), if I record a workout on the Carrot workout app, or with one of my other workout apps (NikeRun, Fitnet, etc), it automatically puts the calories burned into my Carrot calorie counting app. Makes life a lot simpler.

What do you guys use and why do you like it? 




 I'm in the same boat right now. I've had the flu all week and today was the first day I felt well enough to put on real clothes and leave the house. I haven't been counting calories all week (and I'm pretty sure my app is going to yell at me when I open it up tomorrow).

No real help here, just letting you know you're not the only one. I will have to return to working out a bit slowly, as the flu took a lot out of me and I think I'll be weak and vulnerable for about another week. 




 I can see the Buzzfeed article title on Day 11: *This man sneezed every 30 minutes for his whole life. You won't believe what's happened to him!* 




 But sneezing isn't a pressure release. It's suppose to blow all the bad stuff out of your sinuses.

 I also hate when people talk to me on a plane. Or anywhere. I keep my headphones in and don't make eye contact.

 There are subreddits for that... 




 This is now the background of my cell phone lock screen. Thanks for the post, OP! I needed a new lock screen. 




 I have the best chicken ramen noodle recipe ever. It sounds so gross but it's incredible.

Make the noodles, strain out most of the water. Then stir in about half of the seasoning packet and toss it with a bunch of lemon pepper. Set it aside.

Cook a can of cream of chicken soup. Ladle the soup over the noodles to your preferred level of soupiness.

Enjoy.

The whole thing costs like a dollar, and takes 15 minutes tops. And it's so delicious. 




 No... That's not... Am I missing something?

I think it's a great example of how humanity has basically invented a near-perfect way to describe the world around us.

 Yes, but people with a smoking addiction understand that what they're doing is unhealthy. They don't think their doctor is shaming them because the doctor suggests they stop smoking. But apparently doctors are fat shamers because they tell their patients that they need to loose weight. It's a health issue, not a vanity issue. 




 Well then she'll enjoy a very short life before her fat body kills her. Anyone who chooses that over a normal-length, healthy life must be seriously lacking in common sense. 




 How is it not a choice? Burn more calories than you eat. Fat people are *choosing* to eat too much and not work out. And don't cry "medical conditions" because that makes up a very small percentage of overweight people. They just aren't trying hard enough, if at all. Also, most of their actual medical conditions would resolve if they lost weight. [Here's a video of a man who couldn't walk unassisted and still lost weight.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9FSZJu448) 




 Welcome to the human race, where we harshly judge those who choose to not look like humans and destroy the one body they were given. 




 But muh cundishuns!!! 




 Have heard people lose a lot of weight and then thank the people who shamed them into it, because without being bulled about it, they never would have made a healthy lifestyle change. Acceptance is a huge motivating factor for humans. 




 This is helpful, thanks! I'll try some different locations. I am a seasonal runner, and this is a new problem, but I've moved since last year, so I'm in a different neighborhood now. (Holy run-on sentence)

I try really hard to maintain the in through the nose, out through the mouth thing, and it'll get easier after a couple weeks, once I'm back into it fully. My route starts off with a huge hill, which uses enough energy to start mouth breathing (also, I'm not good at running, but I try). Another reason to try a different route. 




 Hey fellow shitlords. With the warmer weather I've been running again. I'm having this problem where I cough violently for like three hours after a run. Google searches have turned up some possible reasons (probably irritants from breathing through my mouth), but nothing helpful for preventing it or fixing it. Any one have any tips or remedies? 




 What the fuck did he do to his tongue? Can someone explain this? 




 I miss /u/PleaseRespectTables :( 




 I literally jumped. Thankfully I'm the first in this morning. 




 Go away. 




 No I'm saying if I don't get hired because they think I'm going to have kids and take leave, that's a punishment because I'm not planning to have kids. 




 It's an assumption though. More and more career women are choosing to not have kids and we shouldn't have to be punished because the company is afraid we're going to do so. 




 This would never happen because it makes sense. We can't go around having things make sense in the workplace. 









 1) Yes.

2) My college psychiatrist kept trying to say I had depression and I was convinced that my moods were perfectly fine. So I sought out a psychologist for a full objective workup and testing.

3) In some ways I'm happy I did it because (after therapy) I became more aware of my actions and why I behave the way I do. In other ways I wish I'd never gotten diagnosed. I was happy just being a shitty person. Now I'm trying way too hard at everything I do, and I'm putting way too much effort into trying to be a normal functioning member of society. It blows dick knowing that you have this serious detriment to how you perceive life and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. 




 I think he's just overall frustrated with her. She keeps making him do extracurricular activities he doesn't want to do. She's one of those people who makes everyone feel like everything is their fault, everything has to be her way, everyone has to do what she wants, etc, and that combined with her other personality traits makes a person simply get sick of her really quickly. In normal social situations, when you get sick of someone, you just go away for a while and feel better. But when you live with the person, it's like a never ending cycle. 




 My best friend has Asperger's (high-functioning autism now?). We get along fantastically because we just spend our time hating on everyone else. He also understands my introversion and need to disappear from the world every now and then, where most people think that means there's something wrong and they need to fix it.

I did it right though I think. I made him an employee in my company (we're in the same line of work). So I basically have full control of his time and resources. 




 He definitely has a lot of pent-up anger issues; I can see that. He seems to internally fume for a moment every time mom talks to him, and I can tell he has to consciously calm himself down. I've been there with her; I know what it looks like.

If I was a better person I'd know how to help him, but for now all I can think to do is be someone he feels comfortable talking to. I'd like for him to be able to come to me if he's struggling with certain dark thoughts, or having trouble dealing with our mother. I told him "take it from me; I survived that shithole and got out." I've also already invited him to come stay with me the summer between high school and college, just to get him out of that house even sooner.

I think my brother is the only person I will ever encounter in my life that I would do absolutely anything for, and I would hate if he had to bear a similar burden as well. 




 I hate not being able to form strong emotional attachments to people. I try really hard to make it happen. I'd like to find someone to be with long-term at some point, but most people run when they realize that you've hit the max of your emotional abilities. 




 I had a lovely conversation with /u/aggitator not too long ago. Seems he's deleted his account since then. 




 You're mistaking reddit for the internet. Of course there are dark corners of the web, but that's less than 1% of the every-day user base. Way to go on making a moot point.

The fat people on The Biggest Loser aren't being wildly accepted. Otherwise it would be called The Biggest People Who Aren't Going To Lose Weight. That show is literally trying to make these people not fat anymore, and does do through lots of fat shaming and generally making these people feel like absolute shit about their body.

I see you've given up on arguing the original point at hand, and have resorted to dissecting the intricacies of part of what I say, rather than understanding the broader point.

Good day. 




 I do what I can. 




 Are you really going to separate real life from the internet? Do you know what year it is?

And you're wrong. HAES is leaking out all over the non-internet world. Heard of Tess Munster? She's been all over the news lately - legitimate news sources, not just reddit. There was the whole Katie Hopkins controversy not too long ago. In the news just a few weeks ago were ex-contestants of The Biggest Loser going to the media and spouting their fat acceptance bullshit. I could go on. 




 The fat acceptance movement has become synonymous with the Health at Every Size movement (HAES). 




 Ay fellow shitlord :) 




 Here we go.

Like what others are saying. Being fat is something a person can control. You can't control being a certain race. While you can control being a certain religion (to an arguable extent not fit for right here), it's not unhealthy to be one versus another; it's a personal preference.

I'm against people who are trying to convince the public that fat is perfectly healthy. It's setting a despicable standard, and they are arguing against decades, if not centuries, of medical research. By trying to save the feelings of people who make poor life choices, society is enabling them to continue to make those choices.

Think about smokers. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you. Everyone knows that it causes cancer and lung disease and all kinds of nasty things. But you don't see a group of smokers trying to tell the public that it's perfectly healthy, just because someone said they were gross for being a smoker. You don't see them saying "I'm perfectly healthy *right now* therefor it must be a healthy lifestyle choice." But you see obese people saying "I'm perfectly healthy *right now* therefor my obesity must not be a health issue."

Do you get it now? 




 As a dedicated anti-FA person, this makes me happy to read. Keep up the good progress until you're to a healthy weight and prove all those fat acceptance people wrong. Be the living proof that making healthy lifestyle choices DOES affect your weight. The world needs more weight-loss success stories. Congrats on being closer to yours :) 




 There's a difference? Has my whole life been a lie? 




 Thought I'd share. I have a friend from high school with whom I've stayed close (we're 25 now). We hadn't seen each other in a while because I moved away a couple years ago, but I was in town recently and we met for dinner. She recently got divorced and told me that it happened while her and the husband were trying to conceive. So we got on the topic of kids. She's definitely a mother person. I'm wholly surprised she hasn't yet popped any out. But I told her I was firm in not wanting kids, and she was so accepting of that. She even went on to say she couldn't even picture me with kids. Made me so happy. It's unusual to have a parenting-type person understand the desire to have a career without a family, especially at the age I am now.

I hope all of you have a friend like that. 




 25 too. 




 Hey r/soc. Haven't visited in a while, but wanted to get some discussion and see what you all think.

My kid brother is 14 and he's showing signs of developing ASPD. Our mother is textbook narcissistic, and it seems like she's perceiving him as the golden child where I was the scapegoat (look up your NPD parenting types). If you're too lazy to look it up, imagine the (very extreme) family relationships in Bates Motel. Norman = golden child, his older brother = scapegoat. Both ones will fuck a kid up.

I was visiting recently, and I've been very open with him because I'm trying to educate and spare him. But he asked me things about killing people and how hard it would be emotionally. I gave him some resources (r/watchpeopledie, etc) to look at and see what he thinks/feels. He's already super apathetic, doesn't really care about anything. He doesn't get in trouble but he's also almost completely unsupervised. He's kind of doing the dance of "I'm going to do what my parents say just so they stop bitching at me" and then finds shortcuts around it to appease them. He doesn't have a lot of friends, very very introverted.

Some more stuff that is most likely just 14 year old boy stuff, but possibly worth mentioning: He says he's not smoking weed, but I'm not sure I believe him. He sneaks out of the house in the middle of the night and goes god only knows where. My parents live in the middle of fucking nowhere. He's a very convincible liar. His grades are going down, even though he's brilliant.

Not looking for an is he / isn't he discussion. He still has a few years before that's determinable. Just general talk. What do you guys think? How were you when you were 14? I was presenting differently at 14 and also much earlier than 14 (started showing signs around age 9sih; I'm 25 now). I was more of a liar/manipulator/conduct problem kid. I'm female, so not sure if that makes a difference in symptom presentation (not yet enough research done there).

 This is my general attitude as an adult. 




 Mine does this. It says no new people, and then an hour later I'll have 15 or so cards without changing any settings. I also live in a college town with 30,000 people close to my age. 




 Hahahaha you're my new favorite person in this sub. 




 I second this. 




 I sent a message to the mods of the Hand, earlier today. Did you not receive it? 




 Times have changed in the past 2 or 3 years regarding phones. Maybe it's because I'm older than college-age now, but nearly everyone I know has at least an iPhone 5 or Android equivalent. You can even get a decent pay-as-you-go Android phone at Walmart now for $50. 




 My college roommate was picky about locking the deadbolt. He would leave for the entire summer though, and that was my time to never lock the door. My then-boyfriend needed to get something out of my place one day while I was at work, so I told him to just go over and the door will be unlocked. I get a call from him saying it's locked. I immediately freak out. I check to make sure I don't have my keys on me, maybe I had absentmindedly locked the door or something. But I don't have my keys. In a panic, I leave work and go home. Sure enough, the door is locked. I starting freaking out, thinking there's been a robbery and the culprit was kind enough to lock the door behind him/her, except the interesting thing is that the handle isn't locked (like you can do by locking it while the door is open and then closing the door behind you), but the dead bolt is locked. I text my roommate, thinking maybe he's returned from summer break a few weeks early, but he's in another state. We think maybe the dog jumped up and hit the lock by chance, but ruled that out as the dog is a 15lb Pom with bad hips. So we wait for the maintenance guy to come unlock the door. I go in expecting to walk into the scene of a burglary, but see nothing amiss. My house keys are sitting on the door-side table, where I always leave them. I ask maintenance if they'd been in that day and they say no.

To this day, I still have no idea how the deadbolt got locked, with the only set of keys that could do the deed, locked inside. 




 generally lower res

Not anymore. Do you know what year it is? Also just tested camera time. The iPhone has that handy slide-up-the-lock-screen-to-get-to-the-camera feature. Less than four seconds from picking up my phone to snapping a clear picture of something across the room. 




 Sometimes the cats will stare at a random spot and then the dogs will start barking at that spot. That's usually my cue to leave the room. 




 As the largest group, we definitely have the best networking. And networking is the center of all good things that could happen to your professional career. As for parties, we don't think before we act, so the wildest things always seem to happen to us, over the more reserved colors. *"Did someone say drunken bicycle race?? Fuck yeah, let's do it!"* We are lacking in our philanthropic efforts, as we tend to think more of ourselves than anyone else, but we have joined a couple of alliances for the betterment of the Button community! That counts, right?

 I agree with what others are saying. Dating in general is nerve-wracking, and meeting a guy off the internet can be very scary, for a million different reasons, some of which are safety related. I prefer to talk to a guy for a couple of days (Tinder message or text) and then if I feel ready or comfortable with meeting him offline, I'll suggest a date. 




 This is the scariest thing I've read all day. 




 Why do you have an Apple logo next to your signal bars?

 I match with people I know all the time. If I see someone I know, I always swipe right just so I can give them shit about swiping right on me. It has revealed some actual intention though from guy friends who would probably never have pursued anything otherwise, so that sometimes gets a little weird.

Everyone's on Tinder nowadays. Laugh about it and move on.

 Thank you for saying this. My biggest annoyance is when people tell me there's nothing wrong with me because I don't seem like I'm having issues. Well, yeah, because I'm using up all of my mental energy to act like a normal human being. Sorry, not sorry.

I once broke up with a guy I'd been seeing because he casually mentioned that he didn't think mental disorders were a thing. He told me that depressed people just needed positive thinking, and that I was "locking myself into my disorder" because I had accepted that I had it. I'm surprised I didn't punch him.

 I agree with this. I'm on my computer non-stop from 9-5, and then I'm not on until later because 5pm is when I go run errands and be social and stuff. I think a better time frame would be around 10pm when we're all out of after-work things to do so we're home and bored and on reddit. 




 Have you joined your brethren at /r/59s? 




 How would that work? The bot account would have to have been created before anyone outside of reddit knew about the Button. Also, they still would only get one click. 




 Don't pretend to know the struggle that surrounds those of us who have/had the option to press.
