 I looked down at my five dollars and saw the Doctory goodness and just had to make it!  









 Totally adorable!  




 Im really not familiar with "grades" in America, can someone please tell me how old someone in 9th grade is?

Also, I had a teacher like this in secondary school from year 7 to 9 ish and he was such a racist to this kid (only muslim in class) and it was practically to his face. I guess the kid learnt to just ignore it but because it was our teacher everyone in class was so conflicted. The worst thing about it was that he was our Religeous Education teacher who actually studied to teach history so he was constantly pissed at something. 




 Thats awesome!  




 :D x 















































































 Anyone else red this as "yo mama"? 









 [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybIGOscPtl4 feature=related) is the only real reaction to have. 




 Looks like Karl Pilkinton 




 I have to hand it to you, good comic 




 I once tried to push two of my girly friends exactly like the bottom frame in reception (preschool) . It did not end well, one got a black eye and the other a bleeding nose. Whilst I got a phone call home from my teachers. To this day I have no idea why I did it.  









 Have you thought about starting your own business in perhaps something similar? 
If not...off the top of my head:

Becoming a lecturer in film and TV production at a college, university or running classes.

Graphic design advertising business? Something maybe more creative based.

Not many examples but I hope I sparked some inspirational mind magic for you! all the best! Also, just so my curiosity doesn't get the better of me which films and such have you produced?

Also, if your not too busy, I am just starting a course at the London College of Fashion doing Technical Effects for performance. I was just wondering do you have any advice on how to get into the prop makers department? Thanks :) x x x  
 




 That is fantastic! It must take a very long time to create each piece?

 Dejavu can be a sign of a brain tumour. Not trying to scare you or anything but two or three times a day is very worrying. :( xxx 





























 Op name very suspect in this fishy situation... 




 You should try quilling! Its super easy and really fun, [example](http://www.epherielldesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/yulia-brodskaya-paper-construction-heart.jpg)

All you need are small strips of paper and a quilling tool, or curl them by hand by simply rolling them (i did this for ages until i discovered the quilling tool). Then using a fast drying glue use small blobs to stick them down. Its simple, easy but very effective and pretty. 




 such a cute couple!!! 3  









 Yummyyyy :3

 Two lady's together for tea and cakes does sound amazing.

 Other than adorable little fluffy balls of cuteness with ickle tongues! Those little hamster things with horns in ARAM are target-able, do you think they will be used for something in the future? Or can they already be killed or used in some way? Tell me everything about them! I love them!  




 I imagine a montage of peoples yawns, those of which I have stored in my head. This makes me yawn tons and I quickly fall asleep.  




 Looks like its sniffing  




 However, did your sister ever call them? Or sit around waiting to be called?  




 Awww thank you, and by all means :D xxxx
