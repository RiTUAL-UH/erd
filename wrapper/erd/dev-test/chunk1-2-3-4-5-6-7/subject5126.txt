 Ha! Personally I think monogyny is overrated anyway.  Don't let society pressure you into having to have a bf if it's not what you want. But you're hot, so I'm sure getting what you want shouldn't be a prob! 




 You're young and beautiful.  Please don't go putting on a lot of makeup.  You don't need it and I see so many girls killing they're natural beauty by wearing paint. Also, at 6'4" - I can really appreciate a tall beauty.  9.5/10 




 You're hot. 8/10.  Why do you think you've never had a bf?   




 You're so cute! 7/10 




 Is this thing the size of a truck or is that guy just *really* short? 




 That wasn't a question. It's not efficient to work employees to the point where they kill themselves.  




 8/10 - I'd smash 




 If you're a company making your employees work 100hr weeks you need to create two jobs and hire two people.  Gah. 




 Really. You are a joke and you're hilarious. In a sad way. The other comments ring true and honest. The fact is that I have very high self esteem, I frequently get requests to model, and I'm drowning in pussy. Maybe a slight narcissism exists but there is nothing 'quite tragic' about seeking approval and showing off ones hard earned abs in this sub is to be expected.  Btw; you're full of shit with your obvious contradiction:
 I wouldn't say you're ugly because that is unfair

vs

 you can't accept that you're ugly

You're pathetic.  Get help. 




 Hard work pays off.  Good job. 




 Good one. 




 Enough about some president that was before our lifetime.  Are you on Mount Rushmore?  How will you be forgotten?   




 6/10.  Do some squats or something.

Drinking too much: age 25

Not caring about your health: age 30 




 You're a handsome fellow.  7.5/10 




 Athletic high (runners, swimmers, fighters, etc). 




 Carb filler: Brussels Sprouts.  I just eat them raw.  They have a ton of fiber, + some protein, and they fill you up fast and keep you full. 




 You're hawt!  Nice thigh gap.  9.5/10 




 Porn magazines. 




 I agree.  That can't be working for her.  She'll either have to be less of a bitch or be hotter. 




 Stop making a duckface.
That piercing is not flattering at all.
Go with your natural hair color.

 I'd eat your ass. 




 It must suck being fat, ugly, and generally unattractive.   




 Undercover shitlord.  I get it. 




 Don't as for honesty if you can't take it.  You're fat, ugly, and age terribly.  Honesty. 




 3/10.  You look like you're in your late 30's.  And you're fat.  And this picture is of horrible quality.   




 Hi.

The website asoftmurmer.com works wonders for me. 




 You're beautiful.  9/10. 




  Step 4: Get new glasses. Those are too small on your face.

OR; get a smaller face.  Your face is too big for your glasses.   




 You look like you're 40.  Are you balding?  
I have a fix: Consume less than you expend (talking calories here).  Repeat this behavior consistently until you are no longer obese.  Then consume as much as you expend.  
 




 Why you Russian, are you late for something?

 Good at Google. 
























 People who put raisins in cake should be prosecuted by cake courts.   




 That's a solid vice. 




 I'm literally at work. 




 That took a lot, didn't it? 




 Two for cake. 




 Nice.  I like it.  I have one of the flagship year Mazdaspeed 3's but I'm not super into fixing it up...probably b/c I live in a city and almost never drive. 




 What kind of cake? 




 Books! Now I'm picturing Johnny-5 tearing up a library, shaking a bit from the large dose of books. 









 That is a proper full sentence.  Please learn English, bot. 









 You're doing great!

 I got in trouble for throwing an apple core into a heavily wooded apple on school property because I was "littering."  It isn't literally littering.

 I thought it was all the obese mods being butthurt. 




 I can just crush arugula.  It's a vegetable.   




 TIFU

The titles are always misleading that anyone can relate to.

TITLE: "TIFU by going to the grocery store"

TEXT: "I walked around with my cart of groceries, texting, and didn't see the guy on the ladder who I bumped into causing him to fall and knock over a case of soda!"

REALITY: You fucked up by bumping into some dude because you weren't paying attention.  The fuck up was NOT going to a grocery store. 




 It was so *underground* then! 




 I think you're beautiful! 9.5/10 




 Will a hipster still buy its album? 




 Hi. I spent 4 years in the Navy.  During this time, I was required to do a lot of swimming for my job and I also did long distance running (halfs   fulls) in my spare time.  I also lifted heavy.  

Generally gains   distance do not go well together.  I found it almost impossible to keep on weight from lifting.  I was eating A LOT and still, weight would just fall off. I'd be waking up several hours before a race to consume a crap load of high hypoglycemic carbs to fuel throughout the run and dumping on proteins afterwords.

If you're going to prepare for this, know that you will likely lose mass.  On a side note; it's not very good for your joints to carry a lot of mass when doing distance.   




 Beautiful. Fit. Tall? 10/10. 




 Good one. 




 You do not look 19.  Currently 6/10.
Some suggestions: Your skin looks dry.  Try cocoanut oil, this might help you look closer to your age too.  You look sad.  Smiling, even if it's forced, makes us happy.  Try it.  And don't just smile with your mouth, smile with your eyes.   




 Do you actively seek a girlfriend?  What kind of girls are you going for? 




 9/10 - so hot. 




 The odds of me contracting a severe STD, based off of the demographics that I date, are roughly 1 in 100,000.  I'll take those odds.  How's your personality treating ya?  Can't get a bf but you're not fat or ugly?  Good luck with that. 




 Haha, yea man, thanks. Keep being awesome! 




 Dude, when I was your age I used to think of all these things I could do to look older.  Be patient really is a virtue and it *will* pay off.  

I'm m31 living in NYC. I didn't stop growing until I was like 24 and didn't get my true confidence until maybe 27 but now, it's like I can have any girl I want. I love it.

Keep up the gym, stay active, stretch and above all, just believe in yourself - life can get SO awesome! 




 6.5.   




 You look very young and as a fellow young looking late bloomer I can affirm that you can definitely benefit from this later in life.  7/10. Get in shape and you'd be more like a 9. 
























 It could have stayed there.  She escalated the situation. 




 Thanks. 




 You're the best! 




 Wow, you look SO much better.  7.5/10.  You're thin now, so you can tuck in your shirt and look good.  Thin people privilege.   




 Facially; you are marginally attractive but you'd do well to update your facial hair and haircut.

Body wise; get in shape.

You're like a 6 but you could work that up to maybe an 8. 




 What % of the world population is willing to give up driving their petrol cars? 




 A bit off topic, but when I was in the Navy, just getting out of boot camp - SO MANY people got tattoos of inspirational words in other languages (Asian languages).  Later on, when I was in Asia, I learned from snickering locals that many of my shipmates' tattoos did not actually say what they thought they said. 




 Adjustable dumbbell set, a bench, and a pull up bar. 




 I use mine for a seat when meditating as well.  And to prop up my window.  And a pillow.  It basically does everything. 




 Nice ass.  9/10 




 Is this....it's mating call? 




 Seriously.  Like, they know they're not going to get any positive attention out at a bar so they have to bully people into acknowledging them by being boisterous and larger than life. 




 Brilliant. 




 ha, thanks.  Yes, I forget about this sub sometimes.  Good call. 




 Seriously.  It's like they're wearing their character, or the lack there of, on their sleeve; not *really* knowing what things like integrity and discipline are, just insisting that at their core, under their fat exterior, those traits exist. 




 You've made the right call. 




 Thanks!
 




 I'm a fan of BSN Syntha - 6.  It's whey better than others I've tried. 




 This happened last night.  I'm at a bar for a happy hour after work with some coworkers.  It's getting later, most people I work with have funneled out, leaving just some good friends.  There is an attractive girl standing at the bar, looking bored, so  I walked up to her and struck up a conversation.  This is where the story starts.

I did not notice that she had a friend with her.  Her friend (let's call her Fatty for short) had a pretty face but was probably 70-85 lbs overweight. Fatty kept on interjecting into the conversation I was trying to continue with attractive girl (Fit Girl for short).  It was *really* annoying.  She'd respond to questions I'd pose to Fit Girl. She'd interrupt Fit Girls responses and even answer questions that Fit Girl asked me. Fit Girl was annoyed, you could tell, but you could also tell that she was probably used to this kind of treatment from her friend. 

As I grew increasingly annoyed with the situation, my frustration became visible through my tone and body language.  Fatty challenged me with, "Oh, so you don't want to talk to me?"  

"No," I said, "I was really trying to talk to [Fit Girl]."

Fatty asked "Why?"  Fatty asked if it was because I didn't like "nice girls with good personalities."

I said I didn't like her personality.  She retorted with, "You don't even know me!"

This is where I became a blunt shitlord.  

I explained to Fatty that I did know her and I knew that her personality did not meet my standards.  I knew she lacked discipline, self control, and fore site. I knew we couldn't participate in certain activities that I enjoyed. And then she asked, "why? because I'm a big girl."

"A big girl."

I said, "Yes, it's because you're FAT."  Fatty was SHOCKED.  Like it's some secret that everyone knows but can't talk about and I broke that golden rule to speak that unspoken truth and the sound of it just blew her mind. 

I left.  I didn't get to finish talking to Fit Girl. Fatty was butthurt. 

TL:DR - I explained to an obnoxious fat girl at a bar why I could tell from her being fat that our personalities would not align.  

 




 Can we consolidate?   




 Nice beer choice. 




 Love it. 




 You are BEAUTIFUL.  9/10. 




 When you're about to make that decision, reach under your shirt, grab your fat, and tell it that it does not make the decisions. 




 Can you please teach them to harmonize and post a video? 




 FINALLY!!! 




 They know.  They know when it's quiet time.  Furry little rebels.   




 Please stop doing duckface.  6/10. 




 I love it when they chirp. 




 Might I suggest peanut butter.   




 This seems like a problem that kitten mittens won't fix. 




 Wow. 




 And eventually, you'll feel like shit if you don't exercise and feel amazing during.   





























 Really awful tattoos.  




 McDonalds because that shits gross. + basically any fast food burger place. 




 No prob.

 I've been tracking my drinking habits in Excel since 06 April.  My average daily consumption is 4.8.  My Max consumption in one day is 14 drinks.  A side note: according to my fitbit, which records my average calories burned, I consume ~4,300 calories a day, which is more than twice the human average.  There you go. 




 It's comforting to know that as a sociology major with bad grammar she'll be unemployable if/when she graduates. 




 That's so true. People try so hard not to offend. And this obese culture has turned 'being fat' into something that's offensive to talk about, when really, we should be talking about this issue openly in society. It's not like they're even a minority, they're taking over, we need to fight back. 




 I don't "hate" god. I hate that ignorant people chose to do in the name of god. 




 This. Looks. DISGUSTING.  




 You're welcome! 




 But what if she's on top? And I'm handcuffed?   




 8.5/10  You look tall and you're pretty.  I love your smile.  If I were to guess ethnicity I'd say Vietnam/Chinese mix.  I've spent a good amount of time in Asia/South East Asia but I'm no expert.  Have you considered one of those spit based DNA services; like ancestry or 23andme? 




 You're definitely pretty. You have a good bone structure, your face is symmetrical and you look thin/fit.  8.5/10 - would totally smash. 




 6.5/ Cute.   




 9/10.  You're sexy and pretty.   




 Don't forget about taxes! 




 Yea, it's hard to cheat up from a 10.  I just saw that arm hair and was like, Whoa, I knew we had the right to bear arms but this guy took it too literally.   




 Hi. Full disclosure, I've not been overweight for about 20 yrs now, but I do have a solid command over my body weight and composition.  Over the past 7 years I've had 35lbs worth of weight fluctuation while maintaining a body fat of 10%. 

I see diet and exercise discussed a lot on this/related subs, but there is a powerful tool that is not often discussed here. I'm talking about the mental/psychological/spiritual aspect of controlling your body. I've been regularly meditating for over half my life now. Along these lines, fasting has been used as a tool to reach a higher plain of consciousness for millennia. The key here is to understand that your body and your consciousness (soul to some people) are completely separate. Once you begin to deny your body, in controlled periods, this becomes more apparent. I fast for spiritual reasons, and also I'm very active and eat well, but there is that added benefit of running a controlled drastic calorie defect - you shed fat quickly.  Other benefits of sharpening this tool include avoiding that 3 week on/off cycle of self control. 

Note; techniques like this aren't for everyone and meditation, I've been told, is hard for people to just jump into. But if you're interested in hearing more, feel free to message me or comment back.   




 You look much bigger in one of those pictures.  Also the lip rings aren't doing you any favors.

Almost a 5.  (4.5/10) 




 You're beautiful. 8.5/10 




 A lot of times people cheat because they're insecure.  
[edit] I'd be insecure if I was so hairy. 




 10/10 - you're also exactly my physical type.  Tall, beautiful, fit blonde. 




 That's brilliant. 




 That's the tiny minority; it's the tail of the distribution.  The huge majority of fat people are fat because they're addicted to sugar and are totally ignorant about nutrition in general. Sure, it's not fair that food companies are allowed to put sugar in everything we eat and aggressively market their drug to children, but the most powerful way to change what corporations put on the shelves is to change societies demands. If society is bullied into believing that things like HAES is legitimate, there is less incentive to act responsibly as consumers.


As a young person, this is a very real problem that your generation will one day have to face. Today I saw a morbidly obese ~10 year old in the supermarket.  Her mother had a cart full of sugary cereal, ice cream, and soda (or as referred to on this site, a cart full of genetics). She was born into that environment. This problem has deep roots. I'd love to hear any constructive ideas on how this problem can be solved, but right now, what you're witnessing with FPH backlash, is a pushback against the censorship of something that should not be taboo to discuss openly in society.


And just to bring home the gravity of this epidemic; 
some people are fat because of diseases

 

The word 'obesity' has literally been changed to a disease according to modern medicine.  Some some people have a disease because they're diseased. 




 True. I feel like it's rude and shallow not to eat bc it's weird looking. I mean, it's not like your looking at it while you're eating. And I'm a big fan of the finger test before I go down there. Vegans taste better.   




 6.5 




 6/10.  You're pretty but at 22 you should not be so heavy. I bet you know your way around a potato.   




 8.5/10 - You look a bit more mature than 18.  Personally, I'm a fan of natural.  If you're a brunette, be a brunette, because you can *try* to look blonde, but you'll never really be blonde. 




 Weird looking vagina's are a huge factor in attractiveness.   




 I don't think it's "funny" to hate people because they're ~~big~~ **fat**.  I think it's necessary to have an outlet to pushback against "fat acceptance," which is really just a phrase describing fat bullies forcing society to accept their irresponsible, gluttonous, and destructive lifestyle.  It's nice to sit here and say, "oh, everyone's beautiful and healthy and a product of genetics" but the stark reality is that if we continue on our current fat path, society is doomed. 




 Bars are where insecure "Alpha males" go to mate.  If your not there to fuck   fight than it's not a real bar. 




 Acting stupid/childish. 




 I've never asked but I'll let you know.
[edit] No, it won't. 




 True.  Personally, I live in a city and bike mostly everywhere so it's not a huge sacrifice to give up an auto.  The problems I'm seeing are in deep rural areas where there might not even be strong enough grid support for charging stations.  On the bright side; the way technology is progressing, I think I'll see the fix in my life time.  


































 6/10 - pretty basic looking but cute. 




 And having big man breasts and low testosterone is super manly and straight. 




 I'll have to look into that. Barnes   Noble has a great reference section I'll be able to use to do my research.  Thanks. 









 If four years is "entry level" what's two years? 




 I made it a point of not turning down interviews I got from attending on campus recruiting events close to graduation.  There were many booths for "Financial Advisers" that were open to all majors. Being open to all majors is a red flag on its own but I did research into what they actually did.  Some houses are more legit than others, but most get you to resell life insurance to family and friends.  As soon as they started asking me about my network of fam and friends I politely excused myself and walked out. 




 Barnes   Noble. I don't buy anything there but I like sitting in their chairs and reading magazines.  If only there were a place similar to B N that I could visit and perhaps borrow some books or magazines, take them home for a bit, or read them there, then return them at my convenience.   




 VII / X 




 It's a tough call because you're making a duck face in both pictures. 

In the second photo, the larger zoom makes it harder to see your duck face but it also reveals the large urine stain on your mattress. 

It's a really hard decision. Personally, I'd go with #2, as the urine stain is less embarrassing than the closeup duck face. 




 Physical attraction trumps emotional connection. (In most cases involving males) 









 Those calves... 




 I'm no expert on lady attire but it looks like you have nice legs and I'm assuming a nice butt - so anything that would highlight that?   




 Look at her legs; she definitely does some kind of sport. 




 I don't do English breakfast, this is Murika. It's also missing the beans. And blood pudding is gross.   




 On the left.  I used purple potatoes so their camouflaged.   




 They're those little purple potatoes with onions and rosemary.  




 Math is hard sometimes. Forgot that betes multiplier.  









 6/10 - You look older than 18. You also look like you're pretty fit but your clothing isn't complimenting that at all.

Teeth. 




 Solid 9. You're fit and pretty. 




 But 2,000 calories *is* 2,000 calories.   




 Low and slow. Like for 30-35 min at 225. Spice to taste.
 









 This kind of ignorance makes my skin crawl. I had some idiot on Yelp! message me saying that the racist bar tender that wouldn't serve me wasn't racist because I'm white. 




 Happy to report I've only bought beer from Whole Foods.
 




 Try steal cut oats!!! Sorry I got excited.
I add blueberries and a tiny bit of cocoanut oil. 




 Almost everything I make has onions. 




 not at all. 




 5.5 / 10.  You'd do very well to get in shape. 




 You look like a young Peter Griffin. It seems like there is a handsome young man hiding under all that fat. The biggest improvement you can make is to get in shape. I can give you tips there if you need, otherwise, there are plenty of subs you can use for knowledge and motivation. Current rating: ~2/10 




 I have some things I do that help me maintain.
1. NEVER eat in front of TV. This robs you of the sense of satisfaction you get from food as your senses are being overwhelmed by light and sound.
2. Learn to recognize when your body is not hungry. 
3. Be aware of your sugar consumption. Read food labels of things you eat and notice the addition of sugars. Taper off of sugar. It's basically poison. 
























 That's a good honest slogan.

[edit] but I think Seaside heights holds that crown. 









 Haha, any time! 




 Well the rides and water park are still fun! 




 Try visiting Japan. Their candy is only a little sweeter than American bread. I think 2/3 of Americans have an undeniable sugar addiction. 




 I love how this is turning into a mixology thread. 




 I like a Gin   Ginger.  And if you're feeling nuts; 

Gin + Ginger soda + Fresh Ginger = Gin^3 




 I think added sugars is one of the biggest problems in our economy.  Our government regulates everything but allows food produces to add what basically amounts to poison to almost everything in the grocery store.  Makes me sick. 




 I can't argue with this type of sound reasoning. It's *science*. 




 Not fat, cultivating mass. 




 That's sound logical science. Drinking is like breathing and breathing burns calories. 




 You sure about that? Last time I checked water had chemicals and chemicals are bad.

[edit] but Popeye's still OK b/c chicken = protein = good 




 Haha, great map. 

Yea, Wildwood has really gone down hill.

Also, I grew up on the Jersey Shore. And it's not like the TV show.  Sure, I used to go to Seaside Heights (where the show was filmed) in high school, but we all knew it was a trashy good time. I spent my summers on LBI though. 




 According to documentaries and articles I've viewed, the early 80's is when the US obesity population began to blow up.  Combine this image with the recent presence of meth use just inland along the jersey shore and you'll have a more current view of the boardwalk. It's pretty sad. 




 I'm a late bloomer. I didn't finish developing physically until I was ~25yo. [31M now] It was around 29 that I realized I was hot. It just sort of hit me. Like I have had girls telling me this (sometimes guys too) but it didn't really sink in for a while. It's one thing to know you're good looking, being called "pretty boy" growing up, but all the sudden you're a 6'4" blonde male with the body of a stripper and it hits you.

I don't think it effects my personality too much because I don't view myself in terms of beauty but I am cognizant about certain things that are effected by how I look. I'm more aware that people will try to take advantage of me sexually and vie for my attention. I'm also more aware of the effect I have on women (some men I suppose too) as they can tend to become nervous when I approach them or talk to them. I also notice that some things in life are just handed to me and I'm attributing this to looks. Also, access to parties/clubs is much easier for me I'm noticing.

The one notable change in personality for me is that my standards for girlfriends has increased a lot. Now, I won't even have a drunken one night stand with a girl who's even a bit chubby.  In general they have to be tall, beautiful, smart and educated.  My standards were not that high when I was 21. 




 TIL Gerd wrote der bible 




 You'd think this answer could be found with a quick googling. 









 tis a magical place 




 I wonder what study it's citing. I'm sure it's true if you count overeating as an eating disorder. 




 You're hot. 8.9/10

Is that hair color natural?   




 It *has* fruit in it so it's healthy. 




 You're right, I deserve that.
 




 So I'm at the the Jersey Shore - this place called Wild Wood.  Once a year my friends and I like to go to the boardwalk there to ride all the rides and play all the games.  I'm walking around with a friend and we see a lemonade stand selling giant (1L?) lemonades. We're thirsty but these things are huge so we decide to split one.

We walk up to the stand and order. We get our drink and each have a turn taking a sip. Both of our reactions are the same; our faces scrunch up and we're a bit overwhelmed by the amount of sugar in our drink. You could literally crunch the sugar with your teeth. But whatever, we're thirsty, we'll drink it.  

As we're drinking, we're standing around near the lemonade stand and I watch this very large couple waddle up to the stand. They're pretty big, even relative to the population found in Wildwood, which is on the larger side to begin with. They each order a lemonade as I'm watching them. They start to walk away and take a sip. They each made the same disgusted face my friend and I made when we had our first sip!

Plot Twist! This couple, after taking a sip and realizing it is not to their liking, turn around and walk back to the stand. I'm out of earshot but I can see clearly what happens. They ask the kid for more sugar. They open the lid and he pours a full scoop (probably a tablespoon) of sugar into their giant cups. They look at him like, "come on, really?" and he pours two more scoops of sugar into each of their cups! That's some sweet ass lemonade + 3 additional scoops of sugaz! Wtf did I just witness!?!

They walked away, pleased with their purchase, and at that moment, I realized that that lemonade stand in Wildwood, New Jersey was where diabetes came from.

[edit] spelling of "lemonade"

 That's the nice thing about humor; there is a flavor for everyone.  I'm more of a Louis C.K. fan. 




 I bet it still tastes like freedom!  









 Oh, no offense taken.  It's funny how you go on hearing and saying things without ever really thinking about what it is that's being said.  Like that old McDonald's jingle, "two all beef patties...blah blah...on a seseme-seed bun."  I'll start saying in from now on. 




 I think he's throwing gang signs.  Kids these days... 




 I'm a grown ass man and this shit's funny. Get off your high horse and get a sense of humor. 




 You can kill a sub, but you can never kill what that sub represented. 




 This scientific study proves it. 




 As do I  _ 




 Here in Murika we use stupid units of measurement... 




 I didn't add that factorial and didn't notice it until now. Good eye. 




 You're right. I'm so used to hearing "on a bun" or "on rye" but it really is *in*, isn't it. 









 I don't have enough fucks left explain to you the point of this. 




 [Slow clap] 




 I agree.  I cook and make cocktails with lemon.  Also, lemon has plenty of sugars naturally. 

Side note; Liz Lemon is alright by me too. 




 *Before 5pm 




 Hurray! and Thank you!

Oh wow, my first time being the first poster to a sub. I feel honored. 

Time to update the 'ol resume. 









 YISSSSS!!! They're GRowing BIggerrrr! 









 I'm thinking fork lifts.  




 Let's go for circus sideshow fat! 




 I know their fatter than this.  Should have made the measurement in stones. Or maybe included the weight of their ego. 




 Thin privilege is making the rest of Wildwooders feel disgusting by comparison.  









 That's the most disgusting thing I've heard all week. It's like a gross coffee smoothie. I hate it when fat people try to act tough. It's like, we know your T count is low af and your bones are weak. Who are you trying to fool? 




 Crystal is one with the rug. 




 I asked: Confirmed Sith 




 That sounds really good. I think I'm going to make that into a cocktail actually. But here in America; without adequate sugaz we go into starvation mode and get fatter. 




 It's a trashy good time...when you're in high school.
