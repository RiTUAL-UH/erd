 I've got a *friend* who's been living off-island for pretty much the past ten years. Sure, he's popped back from time to time, every now and then, but as we all know, playing the tourist and actually living in Hawaii are two different things.

Life being what it is, my *friend* will be moving back to Oahu (not 100% official, but he's 80% of the way there, he's paddling his ass off and can see the Islands on the horizon!) and he'd like to know:

"If you left Hawaii in say, 2005, and came back today, what do you thing has changed the most about life in Hawaii?" 








































































































 Hoo said that?! 




 You crack me up.... 




 Size doesn't matter! 




 Do fries come with that shake?! 




  Perhaps insufficient support over the years?

Not very uplifting is it?! 




  Strange how they both face in different directions though

Better let me give you a hand...or two:~) 
























 Hey there /u/autowikibot! You subscribe to /r/train_subject6188 too?!

We're big time ladies and gentlemen! 




 What is [Ultra Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Seven) you say?

"Ultra Seven ( Urutora Sebun) is a tokusatsu science fiction TV series that aired on Japanese TV in 1967. Created by Eiji Tsuburaya, this follow up to Ultraman went on to become one of Japan's greatest fantasy TV series. Such is his popularity that Ultra Seven (or simply "Seven") has appeared or at least made cameos in nearly every Ultra Series following his own and has had far more exposure than even the original Ultraman (though the original Ultraman is without a doubt the face of the Ultras).
Ultra Seven is sometimes incorrectly called "Ultraman Seven" by many sources outside Japan (or in the case of KHON/Honolulu, Hawaii, Ultra 7, as listed in TV Guide when it ran in 1975). Both the series and its hero can also be called Ultraseven (without a space), which is generally the form used when romanized." 









 What is Tanabata?

"Tanabata is a Japanese festival originating from the Chinese Qixi Festival. It celebrates the meeting of the deities Orihime and Hikoboshi (represented by the stars Vega and Altair respectively). According to legend, the Milky Way separates these lovers, and they are allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month of the lunisolar calendar."

It's not a national holiday, so people still have to work and it's more popular with the kids, but many places have festivals and that means food, beer and games. 


































  A virgin

We approve of virgins! 




 Life's a beach, so I'll meet you at the sandbar:~)

*-gives a little wave-* 




   I'm happy to help with any ideas you have.

Seriously, it looks great and I'm stoked.

If anything comes to me, I'll let you know, but to be perfectly honest, so far, so good! 

















































 I agree! Thanks to our CSS Wiz, /u/Handicapreader, /r/train_subject6188 is now the fastest growing sub on Reddit!^not^really... 




 Me too! In bed at 10pm tonight! 

Night all... 









 Tell me about it.

One of them stuck a "Kick Me!" sign on my back earlier today:~( 




 Thank goodness! 




 Got it. Now I've got to find Hazel...sorry, who am I looking for again? 



















 K

I'll ask for free refills too! 



















 I shouldn't be allowed near a keyboard when hungover... 




 Not the brightest bulb in the deck, am I? 














 Indeed. I think the first few goals kind of blew their minds. 




 Japan's coach is already talking about the Olympics. Guess they start qualifiers in Feb? 









 I didn't see any of it live, but I've seen enough now... 




 See? I'm always a day late and a dollar short... 














 Man, I'm watching the highlights on the news and the US women were just on target. 




 It all makes sense now!^not^really 




 Probably, but I've been beat all day today... 




  Mods are ruining reddit!!

You were paid to say that, weren't you!? 




 Juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust a bit hungover.

Don't know why I drank on a Sunday...back on the wagon again! 




 I'm green with envy:~) 




 Ban me!!!! 




 Yes:~) 




 There's nothing there!

Are you feeling alright? Feverish?

Shall I ~~play~~ call a doctor?! 




 Um? 

What-chu talking 'bout, Carma!? 




 Sorry, I couldn't resist! 




 If I suddenly go missing, it means they've locked me in the cellar! 




 It's true, it's blue! 




 "...warns Asian countries could see Australia as 'decadent' if same-sex marriage legalised"

Tentacle porn, soaplands, bj bars, pachinko, hostess/host clubs, cosplay clubs....

He's not including Japan in his statement by any chance, is he? 




 So....

...

...

...any recommendations for a good place to stay? 














  As a Japanese living in Chicago

Tokyo winters are like summer compared to Chicago! 




 Due to the fact that /r/train_subject6188 is now the fastest growing sub ~~in my mind~~ on Reddit, we've had to take on two new moderators in /r/Handicapreader and /u/Carmabound.

Mr. Reader has created the sky above and below us, because, well, I was drunk and/or hungover every day in high school and wasn't paying attention to my teacher in computer class. All things CSS will go through him and only him. He deserves all the credit for everything you see.

Ms. Bound will be in charge of....in charge of....well, she'll be doing the same thing I do, and that's nothing but making witty comments and having lots of pun.

I'm sure after a few months, the crew will stage a mutiny and boot me off my own sub, but lets enjoy it while it lasts, ok?

 




 Let's do it!!!!! 




   he said I would do great as a comedian.

Go for it! Can I be your ghost writer?! 




  I showed this to my friend who works for the county

Can he/she get me a job watering flowers in Waikiki?

Maybe I'm missing something, but I used to see the truck going down Kalakaua every morning and always thought, man, what a great job.
 




 Good gravy, my hangover is really showing in my comments today! 




  If all else fails, my offer to be a comedy duo still stands... and I might even have an agent.
 
At this point in my life, I'll try anything!

 Did I tell you about that?

Go on...
 




  and you're a twit

Thank you. I love you too.
 




 It's such an awesome team, Kane, Toews, Sharp(will he stay?), Keith, Shaw, Seabrook, Hossa and so on...

I was real saad to see Saad leave, but that's just the economics these days.

That said,the best move that Rocky made was pinching the Bowman's from Detroit. 




  it would be great if you could find a writing gig.

It would, but have you read my comment history?!

 




  As a Canadian

As a native Chicagoan, may I thank you for stocking my Blackhawks with your fine countrymen and bringing the Cup to Chicago three times! 




 Ah, sorry, you're right. 2014 was in Brazil, I was confused with the Olympics. 




  That's great :)

It is and it isn't. You know me, I'm such a worry-wart that I'm wondering what will go wrong, instead of enjoying it for what it is.

 Do you already have a place to stay

Yes, I'm just waiting for the realtor to confirm the exact move in date before I buy a ticket. I know it's a holiday weekend and all, but they're kinda laid back when it comes to all things business in HI.

 and a possible job lined up

No. Will have to get on this, but I went through this before when I went from Japan to Hawaii. People don't really want to talk to you unless you're there. Maybe because so many people change their minds at the last minute, but it's next to impossible to set something up via phone/internet.

 Do you have a laptop, or are you going to disconnect again?

I do, but I'm not sure what they have there. I may be offline for a week or so, but I'll try to set something up before I go, when the actual move in date is set for sure.

 




 As an American living in Tokyo, I'm just happy that I don't have to hear the locals gloat for the next four years.

Team Japan is pretty darn good though, and they do work really hard. It's just that the media coverage here is enough to drive anyone mad, unless of course your a fan of the team.

That said, ~~Brazil~~ Russia is only 2 years away, so I'm sure from tomorrow we'll be seeing how the men's Cup will coming to JP for sure!

**EDIT: Thanks to /u/tokomini for pointed out my brainfart. The Olympics will be held in Brazil in 2016, the WC was held there in 2014.** 




 Carma, it's looking pretty good at the moment.

I've got to check back in with the doc next Mon, but other than buying a plane ticket and doing some last minute shopping, I'm pretty much 99.9% sure I'll be off next month.

Strangely enough, right around my cakeday again!

Unless the doc tells me that my body is seriously fucked, it's looking like I'll be basking in the sun soon enough:~) 




 Just want to say thanks to you and all the Mods here for doing such a great job.

That's all. 




 At least I don't have to hear the locals talking about how great Team JP is for the next four....aw shit, 2016 Brazil?!  









 I didn't watch it, was Germany hungover? 




 Well, England did finish 3rd, so it's not all that bad, right?

Do you like how I pitched that? 




 I've always liked him and felt real bad for him after that WS flub. That was just shit luck and a brain fart on his part, but he's always been a hard worker and good player. 




  I thought they just took a map of the island and threw wet spaghetti in the air. Wherever it landed, that's where they put the roads.

Same crew must've done the roads here, 'cause that's pretty much how Tokyo is too:~( 




























































































































 Ew! 

Stop stickying us! 




 May I join in on the confusion?! 




 How *you* doin!? 




 [Yes indeed!](http://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/) 




 Thank yov and in three and a half houqs, it'll be Friday! 




 Happy Thursday to you!

Happy Thursday to you!

Happy Thursday dear fans of /r/train_subject6188...

Happy Thursday to you! 




















































































 It's really awesome, but highly dark and disturbing. 
























 You and I both!

 I haven't watched it straight through from Season 1, because I didn't catch on in time, but man, what a great show.

Strangely enough, it's on DLife here in Tokyo, and D means Disney.

Anyways, I digress, I really like the stories on an individual basis, but there's an ongoing arc involving the Aaron Hotchner character and boy....

I'm not going to go into any details, because spoilers for anyone who hasn't watched it but would like to, but I'm into Season 5.

Wow. 












































 Thanks for making me lose three hours of my life...just...staring... 
























 I think I've been spending way too much time on Reddit recently.

My wife lectured me for about 10 minutes when she suddenly stopped and asked if I was paying attention, to which I replied, "TL;DL!" (too long; didn't listen) 




 Let's just both hope for the best! 




 *hatter wipes away a lone tear*

It's looking like I'll be off right around my cakeday again. My place is confirmed and next is a plane ticket.

Hopefully, I'll get a clean bill of health next week! 




 11 or 18?

Not that I'm stalking you, but you will be missed:~( 




 And that's why we love you!

Hey, by the way, aren't you going on your cruise soon? 




 Lucky lady:~) 














 How *you* doin?! 




















































































 Makes me all warm and fuzzy it does! 




 This is a great move by the Carp and I believe that it'll be the first time in a CL regular season game that this will happen.

 Oh Rob! 







































 As per [this earlier thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Madazzahatter/comments/3ce9vr/its_77_in_japan_and_that_means_its_tanabata_%E4%B8%83%E5%A4%95/) it's Tanabata in Japan! Yay! 









 Went over to Kawaguchi (Saitama) for dinner and it seems as though they're having a Tanabata candle festival going on right now in Nishi-guchi Park! Yay! A little late to promote this, but if I recall, usually 4 or 5 days before Tanabata, they have an street festival on the east side of the station.

 I'd be more than willing to help. 




 This might surprise me. Every time I've been back, we've pretty much stayed in Town, so I've yet to see this.  




 I thought we both agreed to stop drinking, HR!? 




 Nothing makes me happier than hearing this song and knowing that I'm pau hana! 














  Maybe not the right conditions for jumping Spitting Caves

As a flatlander who used to rent a room out in Portlock, there were *never* the right conditions for me to jump there.

I've been swimming off the rocks, but I kinda feel like I'd snap my neck if I ever tried to dive in from up there. 


































   Even mediocre breakfast/brunch places have long lines.

Yeah, I used to like the "Early Riser Special" at Eggs 'n' Things because it used to be dirt cheap and if you went early enough, you missed the lines. 

They're even in Japan now and I'll never understand why people here think pancakes are a Hawaiian "thing." 




 Not really earth shattering news, but I'll be moving back to Honolulu after bouncing back and forth between Oahu and Tokyo for pretty much the last 10 years.

As you all know, there's a big difference between living on Oahu and just popping back...so what do you think has changed the most in the last 10 years?

 




 There was also [Hawaii Winter Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_Winter_Baseball) that started back in the 90's. 




 C'mon.

Be honest.

It's because I'm coming back next month, isn't it? 















































































 Actually, it's only 9am-ish here and I've got quite the busy day. One good thing though, it's kinda cloudy-sunny here and that's awesome 'cause I haven't seen the sun for what seems like months! 



























































 Are we on a 24 hour countdown till your cruise yet? 




 Thank yov? 




 I'm no legal and human rights expert, but *I* want to know how a Winnipeg girl could have been impregnated by her stepfather twice and had two abortions before she was 13, yet not have been deemed a victim of sexual assault. 




 She's got such a great little body... 




 Please join us! Let's make it a threesome! 























































































































 Good god, you're like my evil twin in reverse!

I was born in Chicago and escaped to Hawaii as soon as I finished college. Have been going back and forth from Honolulu and Tokyo ever since! 




 You've got waaaaay too much time on your hands! 




  This is a shit bot

I'm waiting for the Thisisashitbot to chime in in 5...4...3... 




 Thank goodness! 

? 

Maybe:~) 




  Or large predators!

?

Ever been in a club in Waikiki? 




  The hiking meetups are low-key and well worth your time to make.

If you suddenly notice a very strange new face in the next few months...don't panic. Just move away slowly and keep your hands and feet away from it's mouth:~) 




 Let's say I moved to Chicago and couldn't find a job. All I have to do is to pack everything in the car and drive to the next city over.

In Hawaii, your options are limited and it takes a pretty big chunk of change to get over there, let alone return back to wherever it is you came from if things bottom out. 




  You can always check /r/hawaiijobs!

I'm there looking in three weeks so please fill this bad boy up!! 




 Is that smoke from the burning pitchforks I smell?! 




  My RES

I'm afraid to wonder what you've got me tagged as! 




 I lurked here at first because, as some of you may know, I've been living between Honolulu and Tokyo for quite some time now, but due to my family situation, most of that time has been spent here in Tokyo.

Don't get me wrong, I love Japan, it's just that I really prefer to be in Hawaii, *especially* when I'm not actually *in* Hawaii!

Yes, Hawaii drives me nuts at times, but that's the difference between living there and just visiting.

Coming here has helped to keep me grounded, still feeling like I'm part of the community.

Even though posting pics was kind of frowned upon when I first started coming here, thankfully, the community has become more open and flexible to most things Hawaii.

Now, a big change is happening in my life because, unless something majorly bad happens, I'll be coming back to stay from the first week of August.

Because I haven't actually been living full time in Hawaii, every time I went back there, I never went on the internet, spent most of my time in the water and/or walking around.

Now, I hope to balance things out a bit and I hope to become more of an irregular regular here. I want to give back those feel-goods to those of you who are lurking and wished they were actually in Hawaii.
 


































 May I play with them?! 




  Well, if this just doesn't sound like a terrible idea with pretty transparent spin control.

Oh? This sentance...

"This information will then be passed on to hotels, restaurants, hospitals **and other institutions in Japan.**"

...doesn't raise any red flags for me. 



















 Thanks for sharing:~) 





























  Well I am guilty of having 500 alter accounts.

UniGaseouspartdeux? 




  I'd get north of a couple thousand hits on a top post.

Sorry, that was me. I...I...I like pushing buttons:~) 




  Ah, trolls. XD

Not trolls, menehune! 




  WE DID IT REDDIT!

These words strike fear into the fiercest of Warriors!  










































































 Ok, I'm in Tokyo right now and it's 34c/93f and we've got about 67% humidity. I'll be back home the first week of August...so...is it possible to ditch the muggy air by then please!! 








































































































 Thank you /u/moonpurr, /u/hawaiithaibro, and /u/fern420.

As you may already know, I wasn't born in Hawaii and didn't attend school here, so when I first moved here in the 90's, I did my best to read as much as I could about Hawaii and ask everyone as many questions when I could, at the proper times.

I don't try to "be Hawaiian", but I sure as heck try to "be local." And what I mean by that is taking some pride in the fact that my kids were born here, go to school here and we all need to be aware of Hawaii's past, so that we can have some sort of future here.

 

















































 Title is directly from the story, it's the first paragraph. 




 I'm sure you'll be glowing after you spark this up! 



























































 Do tell, where's this at? 



















 No need to worry, because we would *never* do that to /u/carmabound, right?! 







































  I feel like a plan to kill 2 million feral cats by Greg Hunt is likely to involve something like importing 5 million feral dogs.

And then they'd have to import 5 million feral wolves to kill the feral dogs... 

































































































































































































































































































 **Could you introduce yourselves?**

Hey there, I'm /u/train_subject6188! I've been on Reddit for almost two years now.

**How did you get involved here?** 

To be honest, there were three reasons I started the sub, one of which /u/carmabound has already covered. The second was that I joined the Mod Squad at /r/worldnews about a year and a half ago and thought it would be a good idea to learn how to do mod stuff without accidently tripping over the wires and unplugging a default. The third reason was there really isn't a sub out there that will allow me to post my jabberwocky.

**How would recommend your sub to new users**

If you're looking for a place to chill out and hang, pour yourself a drink and come talk story.


**Aims for this subreddit?**

Haven't the slightest clue.

**Favorite posts?**

All of them on /r/train_subject6188, of course! 




 Yay and thank you to /u/handicapreader and /u/carmabound!

As well as the fine folks at /r/TinySubredditoftheDay 




  They should consider Vancouver over Toronto if nature is what they're after.

I've never had the pleasure of going over to Vancouver. Have been through Toronto twice, when I drove from Chicago to New York through Canada...talk about taking the long, scenic route!

I really liked the drive and Toronto too. 









































































































































































 Lot's of positive vibes coming from these kids and it's good to see that they really do want to venture out of Japan. 















































































 This story should be used in the travel brochures for Norway because after reading this, I really want to hop on a plane to the Historical Museum in Oslo. 









 It's always me, isn't it?
