 (TRIGGER WARNING: PHOTOS OF SELF HARM SCARS)

http://imgur.com/a/DSP1C


The above links to photos of my scars. They are about three years old, very white in color now, and pretty noticeable against my olive-ish skin. I've finally started to venture out in shorts and tank tops since the summer has been scorching, but I get tons of people commenting and staring. I'm a nanny and have been looking for a new family to work for, but it's hard bc I don't want the kids or parents to see my scars. In the past I've had parents let me go because of my self harm scars. These scars have been debilitating my self-esteem and it makes living a "normal" healthy life post-depression and self harm kind've difficult. 

What are the best ways to fade self harms scars? They haven't changed much in the last year, and are still very noticeable so I'm afraid that if I don't do something, they will stay like this for the foreseeable future.  
























 You sound a lot like my brother. He's 20 and he recently asked out a girl for the first time. He got rejected. He's very insecure and the rejection left him saying things like "I'm not meant to be in a relationship" and crap like that. Unless you think getting rejected won't take a shot at your self-esteem, I would "work" on yourself more.   
























 I forgot what it's called and a google search failed but I've had those bumps all over my body since I was a kid. Recently they made their way to my face as well, so I started using CeraVe (moisurizer) on them... and they vanished in a matter of a couple weeks. I imagine they'd work on the bumps on my body as well but it's too much of a hassle rn lol 
























 Oops you guys are right - what I have is Keritosis. It looked very similar my mistake 
























 I'm a quarter away from getting my Associates in Art (general studies). My original plan was to get an AA with an emphasis in English, which is my school's equivalent of a major. Unfortunately, the job I had at the time was during the day so I wasn't able to take the all the English courses I needed. So I opted for general studies instead. I'm 20 years old now, and I don't know what to major in anymore. I've yet to apply to a single university. 

I had always dreamed of being a writer or editor of some sort, but that was back when I had a passion for reading and writing. After I moved out of my mom's house and started working and going to school, I've probably read 3 or 4 novels. Written a couple pieces of poetry and prose. My writing abilities have suffered immensely, and I've lost most of the passion I had for it. 

Now, when I ask myself what I enjoy doing the most, and what I would never be able to give up, the answer is music. I took up guitar and singing a couple years after I discovered how much I loved reading and writing, and though I don't practice as much as I used to these days, it's what I love to do the most. But I realize it's not a practical career, and I've been told many times over that college is a waste of time for what I'd like to do with music. 

I used to live in LA, and I was playing at caf√©s and bars at the age of 16. This was because I had a couple connections. Independent labels were approaching me, but I was too naive and still loved writing too much to take them seriously (plus there was drama concerning my mom, which I won't get into). I moved to Seattle a couple years later, and I feel like that time has passed (so have the connections). Moving back to LA right now isn't really an option, either. I've heard the University of Washington has a good music program, but I'm still wary. Has anyone here had a good experience with studying in music/do you know anyone that has?

TDLR; I can't decided if I should major in music, because I've been told it's a waste of time. 
























 When I'm truly happy, I feel like I can accomplish anything, and I feel like a totally different person from the depressed self-loathing human being that I usually am. When I'm depressed, I can't even IMAGINE being happy. I literally cannot remember what it feels like, and I am unable to bring myself out of it. 

I get into a 'happy' mood at least every other day, for around a couple hours, and sometimes it'll come on every day. All the other hours of the day are usually miserable. At some point during the happy episode, I remember that I don't deserve to be happy. I tell myself so much crap just so I can go back to being a miserable shit. Things like, "You're ugly. You're useless, you've accomplished nothing. You have no friends, you're a loser. Why on earth would you be happy right now?" It's so frustrating bc OF COURSE I won't accomplish anything or make any friends when I'm depressed. The only way to stop being a "loser" is to keep being happy. But I'm not allowed to be happy because I'm a loser. And the cycle goes on.

Does anyone else experience this sort of inner self-talk/vicious cycle? I desperately want to get out of it. 
 
























 My experience wasn't too bad. I was 17, the oldest there, and probably the most sane, so it was a little scary, being surrounded by people who had a hard time controlling themselves. I was only there for three days, and 3 of the kids there got "bootyjuiced", which is a sedative injected into your ass, and then tossed into a 10x10 room with nothing in it but a small square window in the door. I was miserable, however. My mom packed me a duffle bag with books and clothes, which I was able to keep, but all the drawstrings and shoe laces were confiscated. I had a room with 10 beds all to myself, and I was allowed to stay in my room as long as I liked. I saw the surveillance videos, and the bedrooms weren't being recorded. One of the nurses took pity on me and awarded me the ability to go off the ward, to the gym and the cafeteria and outside to go for walks. I was also allowed to use a razor to shave. I had pretty fresh self harm scars at that time so you can imagine my surprise. Technically you only get those privileges if you go to all the group sessions and participate in activities and "school", but I got lucky I guess. I complained so much to my assigned doctor that I wanted to leave, that he just let me go. The other 20 or so kids were held under very strict rules and watched like hawks. Wow I rambled on lol
