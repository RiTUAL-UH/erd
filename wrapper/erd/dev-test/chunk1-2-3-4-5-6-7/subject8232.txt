 Hey everyone! So, I recently picked up my weber performer, and along with it my wife got me a smokenator 1000, and I grabbed a pitmaster iq110. Because it's a performer, it has ash catching hardware on the bottom, so I have to install the iq110 manifold off to the side somewhere.

Once I have it installed, is there a particular side I should set up the smokenator in relation to it? Should the air intake be below the smokenator, or should it be on the opposite side? 




 Hey everyone!
After 3 years of eyeing it, I finally picked up a Weber performer gold last week, along with a smokinator 1000, an IQ110 temperature controller, a maverick et-733, and a bunch of other toys. We broke it in with some t-bone steaks, burgers, and dogs (totally traditional!). Hands down the best T-Bone I've ever had (brought it slowly up with indirect, and then seared for about 2 minutes one each side to finish and bring to final temp). It was like butter!

I've been using on using royal oak hardwood lump charcoal for grilling, and plan to use stubbs all natural briquettes for long slow stuff.

I am going to be smoking a Boston butt monday for dinner for the week (overnight dryrub sunday into monday early AM, then applewood smoking).  Since I haven't used it yet due to mother nature being uncooperative, I've been watching videos of folks using the smokinator with the same cut. In most, folks are mentioning a smoke of about 8-10 hours, but then in [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VdxA5BntFs) he goes almost 16 hours. This is what brought about my question.

How do you know how long to smoke the meat? When it hits the target (190 ish) shouldn't you remove it? The guy making the video says in the beginning he's expecting a 16 hour smoke - how does he come up with that? It's probably a simple question but the times seem to be all over. If it's based on weight, a lot of the cuts seem to be about the same size range (8-10lbs), so why the difference in times? How do you plan for it? 




 Hey everyone. I am looking to start purchasing some bullion with bitcoin. So far the options seem to be amagi metals, agora commodities, coinabul, and bitgilt (if I don't mind waiting for overseas shipping and feel lucky about customs).

Has anyone dealt with any of these companies? I see lots of negatives posted about coinabul. I also see complaints about Amagi shipping VERY slowly. I can't find out much of anything about Agora, or overseas shipping with bitgilt.

So, does anyone have any others that they use and know to be reliable? 




 Just checking out the price and it seems to have dropped a good bit over the past day. What gives? Is it a big selloff? Or is it from the bitcoin price going up against the dollar and doge, while doge more or less keeps steady against the dollar?

Not scurrd, I'm still long with doge, just curious what everyone is thinking. 




 Pretty simple. I have about 30 or so hits which have been sitting as pending for several months (3+ months). What recourse do I have to get the money I earned? Can I report them for non-payment? 




 Hey everyone (sorry for the periods in the title, automod has a bug up its ass).

Since I can't mine anymore and I refuse to buy asics (single purpose hardware is a waste, and honestly just contributes to trash heaps), I have been investing my coins into several projects to earn a return on my investment. I saw that doge d.i.c.e and just d.i.c.e both allow you to invest in the house, earning a 1% return over time. Have any of you played with it? Have you had success?

Are there any other places where you can earn interest off of your coins that you are using?

The one other place I've been using is a bitcoin arbitrage company which gives about a %1.2 return daily. 









 Hey everyone. I have a paper wallet which I'd like to cash in. Right now I don't have access to my main litecoin client, so I was hoping I could create an online wallet and import it, or get an android wallet and import that way. Can anyone suggest a method for doing it? Downloading the full client isn't an option at the moment because our workplace doesn't allow much outbound connectivity. 




 Pretty simple! I would need to get at least 500 made. Most likely the end price would be 15-20k doge including shipping. 




 Hey everyone. We are currently using an oracle-backed database solution for a product we purchased from a vendor. We received their IOPS estimate based on a spreadsheet and built our SAN to match their estimate. We have 2 2-node RAC clusters, running dataguard between them.

We are looking to perform an augmentation to handle additional customers on this database, but the vendor can't provide additional hard numbers for us to go on. So, what I want to do is look at our current number of customers and the current peak IOPS, and then extrapolate that out to our new number of customers and what we estimate IOPS to be.

The problem I'm running into is that AWR reports don't seem to work right in RAC (awrrpt.sql seems to report back very small numbers). So, for either of those RAC clusters, how can I get real IOPs to/from the SAN? Oracle is the only thing using it.

I hope there's enough info here, I'm still somewhat new with Oracle.

I found this script: http://srivenukadiyala.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/calculate-iops-for-a-rac-database/
but it doesn't seem to work :( 




 Hey everyone. We have a large oracle database deployed (it's bundled in a vendor's software). The vendor provided storage requirements in terms of IOPs, and I scaled the storage solution appropriately given only that requirement.

We are now preparing to augment our storage in anticpiation of additional workload. According to the vendor, we should be ok. However, to be frank, they're basing every one of their numbers on a spreadsheet, and they can't explain how they arrive to a lot of them. This is a big red flag for me.

What I want to do is look at the current IO utilization of the SAN, compare that to the number of users we have provisioned, and from there hopefully extrapolate approximately what our utilization will look like after the augment.

So, how can I best get an IOPs number for a SAN volume mounted to a system that is currently being used by a database? 









 Hey everyone! With the halvening come and gone now, remember, even though we may not be showing up in a lot of profitability lists for multipools, they still have significant piles of coins sitting and waiting to be exchanged. So, before you panic buy/sell make sure that you give the market a few days to adjust. 




 Well, it has been a ton of fun folks, but with this halving I will now be losing about 5$ a day thanks to power. I just want to say it's been a ton of fun, and I've really enjoyed mining doge. I also really want to thank the folks at teamdoge for everything.

At this point I'm either switching to a multipool or going to hop from crapcoin to crapcoin and see what profitability i can find. Given scrypt asics coming out, I don't see myself mining too much longer, and none of the scrypt-n coins seem to be very effective to mine.

So thank you all for the fun, I loved mining. At this point I've got my nice pile of doge that I'll be holding on to until I find something REALLY COOL I want to buy :)

Don't worry though, I'll be sticking around the sub because once a shibe, always a shibe :) 




 Hey everyone!
A few months ago we ended up pulling down an old flourescent tube fixture. I don't have measurements at the moment, it looks to be about 30 inches long but I could be misremembering. I'd like to pull the fixture apart and clean it. Then, I'd like to get some grow lights to help start seedlings. Are there any concerns about doing this? I know you're supposed to keep the light somewhat close to the starting tray to help provide a little warmth. Does light color matter, or can I just use any grow light? Should I use a 24x7 exposure to get them to sprout and then switch to something like 18 on 6 off for initial vegetative growth?

Any help would be awesome. 




 So, the last halving saw the price skyrocket leading up to the actual day of the halving. Folks were convinced that halving the supply of new coins would lead to fantastical increases in price.

Why the different behavior now? Do you think it's a function of muppet investors getting burnt once so they're staying out? 




 I haven't been able to find this. I know Kraken has it on the "to do" list, and so far I think the only exchange that features it is BTer. So, does anyone know if it's supported? Is it planned? 




 Just curious about this one. As I start to near 1m doge, I'm thinking about what to do with them. I don't buy much, and none of the current vendors seem to have things I want. So, I'd like to spend the doge doing things that can actually help spur on our economy, help communities, etc, but earn a profit on investment too.

Are there any groups out there that actively do this? 




 Let's make some friendly guesses!

I'm thinking we'll top out near 300 satoshi this time around. Just a leeeeeeeeetle bit higher than last time, but not too much. What do you think?? 









 I know I've seen a few services where you send someone a link to an item with shipping information, and they purchase it for you with doge. Has anyone used any of these services? Are they reliable? Can anyone recommend any? 



















 So, if I remember correctly, 1.6 is based on bitcoin .9. Bitcoin has stated that that version of the client was impacted, and has released 0.9.1. Due to the way heartbleed impacts the wallet-qt app, it could allow for coins to be stolen.

Are we going to see a patched version of our wallets anytime soon?

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=562400.0 has more information. Exploiting it requires rpcssl to be enabled. But if it is, you have to consider your wallet to be compromised. 




 Now that we can see that ASICs are here in force, can we have a serious discussion about merging or changing PoW? Because I'd like my million+ doge to be worth something in 3 weeks.

Yes, that sounds snarky, and yes, I fully intend it to sound that way. For months people have been trying to warn the community that something significant has to be done to make ourselves resistant to both multipools and to ASICs, but usually the cop-out response is "but it's hard!" or "Doge will be mined out before ASICs are a problem!" The latter is patently wrong. The former, well, is it better to avoid something hard, or have our coin be worthless in 3 weeks because one pool will control nearly 60% of our hashrate and no one can verify that any of our transactions are real?

1.6 was a band-aid. Instead of doing something significant, we changed our algo to allow for faster re-targeting of difficulty, to accomodate multipools entering and leaving. It got rid of a symptom, but not the cause. A cause that now controls more than half of our network.

[As of today, wafflepool controls 53% of our network hashrate](https://pools.rapidhash.net/pool/5). That means, if waffle was malevolent, he could start blocking transactions and initiating double spends. He controls this much thanks to sfire, a large chinese GPU farm that is now getting into ASICs, and is only going to have more in the future. Oh, and he's joked about doing a 51% attack against coins before. When we have a halving in 3 weeks, a number of miners, myself included, will be leaving because we're already barely breaking even for our costs. That means that sfire will control significantly more of the network hashrate.

So, can we please start considering the options that people always balk at because "they're hard!" Things like changing PoW so we're not scrypt compatible and most miners/asics aren't compatible with us. Or are we just going to stand by and watch as our coin plummets to 0 because we refuse to do something because it's difficult? We can keep choosing to "see what happens" until our coin dissolves in front of us, or we can actually do something.

I for one would like to do something. 




 Right now we are essentially getting spammed with repeat threads showing a lot of ignorance, half-truths and FUD. It would be very helpful if we could have a sticky that dispelled that. 




 So, I've been piling up doge for about 3 months now, but I haven't spent a whole lot. Well, today that changed!
http://saltsworldwide.com/buy/fleur-de-sel/

Now if only there was a spice vendor that sold more than salt! :) 




 Simple question - I see lots of API's for connecting to bitcoind/dogecoin-qt, but I can't find anything that lets you simply generate a public address/private key pair. Does anyone know of a library to do this?
 




 Hey everyone! A few days ago there was a shibe from Belgium who was willing to purchase and ship goods directly (things like chocolate, beer, etc). I was wondering if there were any shibes doing that for the Netherlands??? I'd love to get some beer from Brouwerij 'T Ij! 




 I'd like to investigate a non-3rdparty escrow system for a site idea I have. I know some systems out there for escrow (especially in darknet markets) are able to do multi-signature transactions. 

Basically, you provide a private key to the escrow service, they send back a public address, you send the funds to the public address and the escrow service verifies that the funds are received, the vendor sends the product, the buyer confirms it, and then the funds are released to the seller.

Here's a good writeup:
http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions

So, is this supported with dogecoin? 




 I've been looking at the candlestick for cryptsy since last night, and unlike the other recent spikes, I don't see anything weird going on. It looks organic.

So, what do you think? Is this the kickoff of the price increase before the halving as folks buy in? 




 Hey everyone!
I am looking at writing a program, but one of the things I'd like to do is execute trades. What exchanges support doge, and provide an API that allows you to sell via API calls?

I know cryptsy will let you do it, what about others?? I'm a beginner so a well documented API would be hugely helpful 




 So, is there anything like ebay/craigslist out there that can be used easily?

Edit: I suppose I should be more specific - I am looking for non-registered businesses. Specifically, I'm looking to purchase gold and silver from folks who aren't looking to report it to the IRS :-P 




 I just wanted to throw this out there - not all multipools are evil.

Pools such as multipool.us, hashco.ws - they don't automatically convert to BTC unless you tell them to.

The real problem we're seeing is multipools that **auto-exchange** for another coin. This causes prices to consistently drop on exchanges because coins are always being dumped at or below the current market price to ensure a quick sale. 




 Simple!
`use a backtick` to enclose whatever you want to write!

`It` couldn't `be` e`a`s`i`e`r`! 




 I'm curious about this. Yesterday I posted to find out who else was starting to get records in order in accordance with the IRS reporting requirements. I got downvoted to hell.

This morning I posted a link to the IRS form 8300 with a warning that if a vendor fills out that form (usually it's for transactions over $10k, but it can be submitted for much smaller transactions, and is routinely done so by precious metal dealers) and submits it with your contact information and you don't report capital gains/losses on the sale, you could be in for an audit and potential legal trouble. Again, downvoted to hell.

So, /u/ummjackson states that he welcomes regulation, but yet when the IRS regulates, the overwhelming sentiment from /r/dogecoin seems to be "ignore it! don't pay taxes!" 

So, why is that? It seems like actively trying to flout the law is pretty un-shibe. Also, I'm pretty sure that telling people to do things that are illegal, like not paying their taxes, is also against reddit rules. 

So, whats up shibes? Why the jump from "embrace regulation!" to "BOO REGULATION! DON'T PAY ANYTHING!"? 




 It looks like hashco.ws is exploring payouts in other BTC currencies for folks who want to do auto-exchanging. Right now they're only working with Mintcoin, but you may want to send them feedback if you're one of the folks who wants a multipool that pays out in doge. 




 [Let me introduce IRS form 8300.](http://www.fincen.gov/forms/files/fin8300_cashover10k.pdf)

Basically, this form has to be filed by a business anytime that a monetary instrument (cash, bitcoins, dogecoins, goats, glass beads) is received in an amount larger than $10,000 USD, or in a series of smaller related transactions. It also can be reported if cash transactions are smaller at the vendor's discretion.

So, where you should be concerned is if you're thinking "It's ok! I'm never converting to fiat, I'm just going to buy things and not worry about reporting!" Well, not so much. If the vendor chooses to report the transaction and you *don't*, the IRS now has a very good, clear reason to audit you. And if it shows up that you tried not to show them the earnings? Have fun getting arrested.

If you want you can reach out to vendors who are either overseas, or who won't submit the form, but that's super shady and you could get burnt, but it could work.

So, for all of the folks saying, "don't worry about reporting!" that's really not the case.

For everyone overseas, well, you're lucky ducks! :) 




 If anything, this may be one of the most important results from the IRS ruling yesterday. 

The whole concept of 1 doge = 1 doge requires that dogecoin exist in a vacuum, where no other currencies exist. It assumes that no one will ever convert to other currencies, or should even compare the value to other currencies. The IRS ruling shatters that - the day coins are mined, they must immediately be given a base price in USD. 

So, can we please, *PLEASE* stop yammering on about how 1 doge = 1 doge? 

Or, is it better that people keep their head in the sand and end up getting audited and arrested because the dumb motto told them they didn't have to worry about the value in USD?

IRS Ruling:

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf 




 Ugh, this sucks. 

I mine both doge and btc. For the most part I hold doge, btc I convert to fiat (a small amount gets squirreled away to an offline wallet).

Right now I'm putting together a spreadsheet of every disbursement I've ever received in btc/dogecoin, every transfer I've made, every transfer fee I've accrued, every time I've cashed out on coinbase, every fee from coinbase, every fee from the bank, etc. Next I have to look at my earnings each day, figure out what the "closing" cost of the coin was each day, figure out the Fair Market Value of that day's earnings, etc.

These requirements are going to be a huge PITA. But, I'm doing what I've got to do to stay legal. I'm hoping I can take this to a financial advisor and find out the feasability of starting an actual business. It would be nice to write off the cost of my mining hardware and my power usage.

Anyone else starting to go through this process? 




 [Bitcoin-trader.biz](https://bitcoin-trader.biz/?ref=msarro) (yes, that's my ref link, feel free to crop off the =ref part on the URL).

So, I have been looking into this site and I can't seem to find much information. I have an account, and again, the link above is a ref link, but I haven't used it yet.

There are a couple comments about the site on a few forums from seemingly happy users, but that's about all I can find. There are also some videos on youtube talking about earning 10+ bucks a day off of it, but they seem to be folks fishing for referrals.

They seem to emphasize referrals and downlines which has me concerned that part of their sexy payouts is a ponzi scheme. Their daily earnings for the trading pool over the past 20 buziness days average around 1.241%. That would put you at around 29$ for every 20$ invested over the 120 day term. I'm not sure if the mining pool is worth it since it's returning .6% on investment daily right now.

So, has anyone used them? Any success or horror stories? If you want to play around with it, feel free to use the ref link above or just go to bitcoin-trader.biz and check it out. 




 100000 doge!
I'm just testing to see if there are bots that are looking for the [GIVEAWAY] tag. Please don't post if you're a human. 









 So, I understand that it gets rid of "gaming" block rewards. It also allows difficulty to be rapidly re-targeted.

However, per the owners of several multipools, they're not planning to stop mining doge, it just becomes "another scrypt coin" that can't be gamed. So, it seems like all of these "goodbye multipools!" threads are a bit misguided.

Is there something else in 1.6 which will actively prevent multipools? 




 I just want to give you all a big virtual high five. After recent constructive criticism about no organized press releases when we meet big goals, I logged in today to see several. A bunch of shibes stepped up to spearhead getting it done, and folks took those releases and put them out to the news. And guess what? We are showing up!

I'm on the board of directors for a nonprofit, and the biggest problem we have is getting people to follow through on good ideas. Folks always have the best intentions, but a lot of times people don't follow through to get things done. You guys give me faith that those folks that can get things done really are out there.

I am so proud to be a part of this community! 









 Hey everyone. For a long while I've been interested in woodworking, and have been slowly trying to outfit a workshop. So, I think I'm about ready to take the plunge as soon as I can locate a scroll saw.

Are there any good starter kits to cover the basics? I'm familiar with how a lot of the tools work, but I'm by no means an expert, especially when it comes to building jigs and stuff.

As a first real project, I want to build my wife a puzzle box. Specifically, something like this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWNSXyRO5nE

I can't find plans for it, so I am working with sketchup to build it from the ground up. My wife's dad is a mechanical engineer, so I'll probably have him looking over my shoulder. So, do you think I'm jumping in too deep for a first project? Should I find some woodworking "kits" to work on first before trying to build my own thing? 




 So, I have a weird issue where aggressive config settings cause sgminer to crash at launch (specifically if I set memclock to 1500).

 I know you guys are running ragged right now, but you may want to update this (or at least do it when 1.6RC files are available). 




 I'm switching everything to Kraken, unless someone can tell me if there's another exchange with really good volume and supports metatrader? 









 Simple question that isn't addressed in the announcement, and my post hasn't gotten any responses there.

If the software is being released in 24 hours, is it ok to install immediately? Does it switch internally at 145k? Or do we have to update at the same time as the pools? 














 The way I see it, we have a few threats to our currency:

1) Multipools exploiting random rewards.

2) Multipools sending difficulty skyrocketing when they suddenly turn their sites on doge.

3) ASICS. People have been saying that this isn't a real threat. Guess what? They're rolling off production lines. They're here, and they're only going to get better. For you and I it is prohibitively expensive to purchase 10 of them for $2500. However, what about the manufacturer? They've got literally thousands on hand at any given time, and all they need is a few USB controllers to hook them up in a side room of their warehouse. This explains several of the multi-GH whales that have started appearing on some pools.

The feedback from devs so far has been to fix random rewards (which addresses number 1), and implement something like a gravity well (which addresses number 2). Number 3 still doesn't seem to have any solution, we're just relying on time and the hope that "doge will be mined out by then". Hoping isn't a solution.

So, why not look at implementing scrypt-jane (something with adaptive n-factor) instead of vanilla scrypt? This would make our coin largely incompatible with most multipools out of the gate, and it addresses most of the issues with a single monolithic change instead of several smaller ones. For most miners, it would be a fairly trivial change to the kalroth version of cgminer.

It seems like we're fixing several issues with multiple fixes instead of implementing one large fix that can mitigate all of them. I'm not saying that the other issues shouldn't ultimately be resolved, but if we're doing one hard fork, why not address as many issues as possible? 




 Usually on the pool I use it shows as around 2800-3000KH/s.

As of about 5 minutes ago, it's showing 300KH/s.

I really hope my rig isn't on fire. LOL 




 Many companies, when they start to grow, will do stock buybacks. This lowers the number of shares on the market for trade, thus increasing their value.

We could donate mined doge/cash, the foundation buys it back to hold, and in exchange there could be some kind of return to investors. I have no idea what it would be, I'm only beginning to think through the idea. But I'd love to hear some feedback.

I have to give credit to /u/CokeRobot for making me think of it with his idea of everyone buying 1800 doge a piece.

 Simple! post your favorite thing or memory from the dogecoin community! Let's bring some positive vibes! 




 There are 70000 shibes registered in this sub. That means if every single one of us donated 1000 doge, we'd blow the roof off of our goal.

So, how does this raise the value of dogecoin? Simple - PR. When we meet the goal, we can send out press releases. A TON of them. Everyone in the community can get in touch with their favorite news website and provide the press release. It's what's called a media or marketing blitz. We push to have as many news articles out at the same time - make it impossible for people to miss it. Good news means more people are interested, more people get into the market, and the price goes up because demand goes up. 




 Ok folks, how can we get ourselves in the news again? I know right now we're working on doge4water, but what else can we do? How can we pump up search volume? How can we get more vendors interested? How can we inspire shibes sitting on the sidelines to either spend their doge, or open small businesses? How do we keep spreading the love??

We have an awesome opportunity, so how do we move this forward? 




 Hey everyone. I'm just curious about these settings... I tried it before, and the result was pretty catastrophic. I saw a huge decrease in my hashrates, and I also saw my number of rejects skyrocket compared to normal single-pool usage.

However, I've switched from a single threaded approach to a multithreaded approach, and in general I've seen my number of rejects plummet. Has anyone gotten load balancing working nicely? What pros and cons have you experienced? 




 So, for the past 3 weeks i'd found a configuration which was "stable" but only on 14.1 drivers in BAMT 1.5. If I tried bamt 1.3 or 1.5.1 (using 13.1 and 13.2 drivers respectively) almost any setting would cause a crash on bootup.

With the 14 drivers, my GPU engine will never go above ~980mhz, despite being a Sapphire TRI-X OC R9 290 which is supposed to have a factory overclocked base speed of 1000 Mhz.

Well, this evening I decided to try things a little differently. I'm still using bamt 1.5 with 14 drivers, but I decided to cut xintensity down to 8, and i configured 2 gpu threads.

Holy cow. Where before a "good" pool was giving me 3% rejects, I am now on what had been the "worst" pool for me, a multipool, and I am hovering at around 0-0.5% rejects. On top of that, my kh/s is hovering around where it had been before.

I think I'm in love! Also, since this is a bit less intensive, I am going to try 1.3 and 1.5.1 again, and see if the different drivers provide an additional boost.

So remember folks, sometimes it's better to finesse your rig than it is to just go balls to the wall with overclocking :) 




 Just saw this... looks like Helixminer asics are going to be released in the next few days. Based on early reports they're looking significantly more stable than the previous dualminers. They're approximately 300KH/s, consume less than 100w, and cost about $295 (+/- $10)

I'm contemplating picking one up just to tinker with... anyone else checking them out? 









 Pretty simple, really. Every day I see posts coming in about things "you shouldn't do." Things like:

* Don't day trade
* Don't convert doge to other currencies
* Don't compare the value of doge to other coins, or fiat currency
* Don't mine at large pools
* Don't mine at multipools

Well, I'm here to tell you to *ignore them.* 

You're an adult. You can make your own decisions. You are also responsible for the *consequences* of your decisions. The whole idea behind cryptos is to free people from bodies that exist solely to tell them what they can and can't do. Do what you want, just make darn sure that you know what you're doing before hand.

Just try not to lose sight of the fact that we're trying to build a community too while you pursue your own interests. Stay active and participate. We need you here, and not just staring at candlesticks. Enjoy your freedom and see where it takes you. 









 Seems like almost every altcoin is down this morning - it's a good time to buy doge if you have some free BTC on hand since they seem to be getting pumped right now.

Anyone have any insight? Is there some new news I'm missing? 









 I am looking at their services and am considering trying them out for the tips/doge exchange. Has anyone used them? Are they reliable?

Hey everyone, I picked this up for my mining rig, but ultimately ended up not needing it. It is in all original packaging, the only thing missing is the shrink wrap (it was literally used 1 day until I realized my rig was too far from the WAP). It supports windows, osx, and linux.

Because this will involve shipping a physical good, I'm going to ask that you pay first to help cover the cost of shipping.

NOTE: For linux, this is the [B1 revision](https://wikidevi.com/wiki/ASUS_USB-N13_rev_B1) of the device with the RTL8192CU chipset. To install it, you just have to go to [realtek website](http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1 PNid=21 PFid=48 Level=5 Conn=4 DownTypeID=3 GetDown=false Downloads=true#2772) and download/install the module and it should show up in wicd. 




 The title pretty much says it all. No matter what setting I put it at, the gpu just hovers there.

I've tried 1.3, 1.5, and 1.5.1 (the unofficial release with 13.12 drivers). In all cases, the GPU-Engine speed hovers around the middle 900's. The annoying thing is, the cards are supposed to be factory overclocked to 1000mhz. They just don't want to run that high. Any ideas what could be going on? 




 Prove yourself:
Pat's vs Geno's

There is only one correct answer. 









 Some folks have real expenses associated with being part of the community - expenses that can't be covered in doge. 

For instance, I know I have to make and sell/trade about $130 worth of dogecoin/btc every month just to cover power for my mining rig. So to me, 1 doge has a real value associated with it. 

While the majority of my coins get stored for long term, the stuff on the short term has a very real value beyond 1 doge = 1 doge, it directly translates directly to USD for me. Try to keep that in mind when someone is talking about value changes - they may need the market to cover expenses. 




 Seriously, do it.

There'd be a few more billionaires this morning if people had done this, and bothered to listen to the thousands of posts, suggestions, and outright warnings about using paper wallets, offline wallets, and never storing their money in exchanges. You can learn more by checking out this post:
https://bitcoin.org/en/secure-your-wallet

Treat your cryptos like they're real money, because they are. I know our community can sometimes come across like a starry-eyed hippie love-in, but we also have to remember that cryptos help increase anonymity, and where people think they can get away with something, they will try to. We also need to remember that businesses will fail. Any time you put your coins in someone else's hands, it's a chance for them to disappear. So make an offline wallet, use it, and take responsibility for your own money.

Good luck everyone. 




 The way my old investing mentor always put it was like this: "Suppose everyone smells smoke - bad investors scream 'FIRE!' And drop everything to get the hell out. Good investors run into the kitchen to get some BBQ before the bad investors realize it's there." 




 This is a pretty great discount considering the value of doge has fallen. You send me the doge, I send you the code to import into iTunes. This item was previously listed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/1yaa8a/sg_25_itunes_gift_card_code_for_18k_doge/) but the buyer never came back.

I have 1 card to sell. 
[SUCCESS] 




 Hey everyone!
This is my first post here, and I'm still very new to android programming. My background is in super-high level stuff (perl, python, mostly massaging data and doing BA). This is my first time really working with an OOP language as such.

So, here's my q... if you have a data structure set up to hold a superclass, can you also put subclasses of that superclass into it? So, say you have a list of Car, could you also put MazdaCar and BMWCar in it too? Or would it only hold objects of Class Car?

The same goes for interfaces... can you make a data structure to hold only objects of Classes which implement a particular interface?

I'm trying to determine whether or not to use an interface or straight inheritance, and this is a big factor for me. Thank you! 




 So, I've read through how PPNLS works several times, but I can't seem to find what the "target" is. I noticed most PPNLS pools seem to have a value, and it changes somewhat frequently. 









 So this morning I had dogecoin-qt open and I randomly got a database error. This was with wallet 1.5.1. So, I shut it down, opened it up, and now it refused to open because of database issues. So, I closed it, upgraded to wallet 1.5.2, and still, it refused to open.

So, I backed up my wallet.dat file and deleted the blocks/ database/ and chains/ directories in my dogecoin install and relaunched. About half way through, I started getting errors involving my wallet.dat file and read errors. Awesome.

I have a backup, however the backup is about a month old. Is that going to cause a problem? 














 Welcome to the official "rate my doge" thread! Where you can share that awesome pic of your fuzzy pal, and maybe get some doge for your doge!

**RULES**

* 1 doge pic per person. 
* I can't see everyone's scores (d'oh), so I'll just go by the number of tips each doge gets (no, you can't tip the same doge twice! (well you can, but it will only be counted once) 
* Voting will close sunday night at 10pm EST
* Any tips to my doge pic (should be the first one) will be added to the pot of 500 doge for the winner. Tips to other doges go to their respective owners :)
* Your score needs to be viewable

So gentlemen (and ladies), post your doges!

PS:
Imgur works as a file hosting site I think :)

**EDIT**

I had to change voting because a bunch of folks have their scores hidden. We'll now tally based on the number of tips each doge gets. In the case of a tie, winnings will be split between the tied doges! 




 Hey everyone! I'm a miner who has been mostly focused on doge, and mining on multipools for BTC. I decided I'll throw my hat in tonight to see how well my rig performs mining vertcoin. I'm pretty excited!

Does anyone have a favorite low fee pool that is stable (especially if it's PPNLS - nothing sucks more than a PPNLS pool that goes down every hour, lol)? 




 Hey everyone! I have a couple trades under my belt now, so you should feel safe. I receive these gift cards occasionally and already have about a $40 balance on itunes I'll probably never use, so, I may as well let someone get the card who can use it!
What you'll get: I will scratch off the card and send you the code, which you can then import into iTunes for the $25.

FYI this is a re-list from a few days ago, a gentleman said he was interested but never came back. The original thread is here:http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/1yaa8a/sg_25_itunes_gift_card_code_for_18k_doge/ 




 Just curious - is there anything stopping a 3-letter agency from creating a "vendor," and then creating a bunch of dummy accounts to pump up their ratings?

Is there something that lowers the influence of a review if it's A) a brand new account or B) the account has only dealt with one vendor?

It's something that jumps out at me based on the howto and looking at the site. 




 So, I am looking into starting a mining pool with some special tweaks that make it extra special.

I am working on the requirements now; I know I'll need server(s) for pushpool (or p2pool, or ecoinpool - i'll probably try each and see what works and what doesn't), front end server(s) running apache which I'm partnering with a developer on to customize, db server(s), and finally the coind software.

I have about 10 years of experience in enterprise network engineering/systems engineering/product engineering, so I am pretty sure I am ok on the technical side. The biggest thing I am missing right now is requirements for the actual boxes.

Is the DB read or write heavy? How much bandwidth can we expect per user? What's the rainy day scenario where you have a 5GH/s whale connect? How much storage is needed per user? What are the IO requirements for everything? What are memory/cpu requirements? I can't seem to find any of this information. I can test it using my laptop for some base info (it kicks out a mean 40KH/s!) but I don't know if it scales linearly or not. 




 http://invezz.com/news/forex/8924-forex-news-bitcoin-usd-resumption-of-play-at-mtgox-any-time-now

It looks like MtGox is going to be opening back up withdrawals, which should mean the BTC price tag should go up, and along with it, other altcoins (including Doge!). What does everyone think?? 




 Hey everyone! I have a couple trades under my belt now, so you should feel safe. I receive these gift cards occasionally and already have about a $40 balance on itunes I'll probably never use, so, I may as well let someone get the card who can use it!

Feel free to PM with questions. 




 Well, this is something that has come up lately when discussing this with other folks, and it's something I personally want to understand.

So, the developers of dogecoin write the software. What exactly did they write? Is it a daemon that generates blocks that are then requested or sent out somewhere? Did they just write the original block which creates something different? How do the pools or users get the blocks? Where do the blocks come from?

The idea of it being decentralized kind of puts the kibosh on a central daemon which generates each block, plus if that was the case, wouldn't it be difficult for the chain to fork?

So, once the blocks have been created by any means, we mine against them. But if solving a block is what provides a reward, how do pools and members of pools get paid if they don't "solve" the block?

Is there any good source on how the whole process of a crypto-currency works that doesn't get too deep into the technical weeds so that your average (or slightly above average) shibe can understand it? 




 I've noticed that there have a bunch of completely benign, benevolent posts lately that seem to get a bunch of downvotes for what seems like no good reason. Maybe it's because I'm new to reddit, but can anyone explain what the motivation is for that? Just being a jerk for its own sake, or do people actively disagree with community-supporting posts?

For example, this post from the creator of /u/dogetipbot:
http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1y8epn/a_few_minor_udogetipbot_announcementsnotices/

Why the heck are there downvotes there? 














 So, right now I've been piling coins into paper wallets. Should I ever import the paper wallet to an actual wallet.dat file, after doing that, is the paper wallet worthless? Or can it always be used to recreate the wallet.dat file? 




 Hey everyone. So I am playing with the rotate pool settings in sgminer and currently have it set to rotate every 12 hours through teamdoge, wemineltc, wafflepool, and multipool. Most of these are PPLNS, so I'm curious how long you really should be connected to each to maximize? I know it's set up to discourage pool hopping, but I'm wondering if 12 hours is long enough? 




 ...do you stick with only one coin? Or do you hop between different pools? I'm trying to diversify, so I've been switching between a few pools (some litecoin, some dogecoin, some like multipool that feed into a cryptsy account, and then hashco.ws). I can't really figure out which is the most profitable (I have to sell off enough to cover the cost of the rig plus power). So, what have you guys found to be the most effective? 




 Just curious, are you guys related to this redcoin?
http://redcoin.pw/

If not, how do you intend to keep your branding from getting confused with theirs? 




 So, I am following several guides to try and tweak this number.
http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemining/wiki/index/radeon_tuning_guide
https://raw.github.com/ckolivas/cgminer/v3.7.2/SCRYPT-README

In both cases, it says that thread-concurrency should be a multiple of my number of shaders (I'm using 3x Sapphire Radeon R9 290's, each has 2560 shaders). I have configured the base memory clock for the card according to manufacturer specs (1300Mhz), and the engine speed too (947mhz). I've also put the number of shaders in the config file (2560).

In the guides it says to keep adding on your shader number until your miner won't start. My problem is that sgminer just keeps starting. I have yet to find a value for thread-concurrency where it won't start, and use the value prior to that. I'm up to 48640 now.

Once I have that figured out I can start pushing up the memclock. Any ideas why it isn't behaving per the tuning guides?

When I tried running cgminer/sgminer without any options, it gave me two bin files, one with 30464, one with 30528. Neither one is a multiple of the number of shaders on the cards. 




 So, I pulled it down from github and compiled it. However when I try to run it, it just pops up a screen saying "Waiting to get work from pools..." where it sits for about 3 minutes, and then closes.
I've run it against 2 pools which SGminer can connect to no problem.

I've put it in a script with the options to export the display and set GPU environment variables. It just won't work :( 









 Just thinking about it - as soon as we past 100,000 and the reward halved, the multipools seem to have gone elsewhere. So, that should mean the difficulty on doge will plummet, won't it? 




 So, about a week ago I traded ~5000 doge on cryptsy for some bitcoin just to play around with it. However when I look at the blockchain explorer, my address doesn't reflect that the coins were ever traded; so it reflects a different balance than what is shown in my cryptsy account. Why is that? 




 Hey everyone!
So as of yesterday, my rig was finally assembled (3x sapphier R9 290 TRI-X). I started with BAMT, and am averaging about 800KH/S per card. That's great compared to laptop GPU mining, but still not where I wanted to be with them. I'm averaging about 970 watts at the wall, and a 5% reject rate (mostly stale shares, probably because I'm using a wireless adapter?). The cards stick at around 65 degrees C (fan rate set to 68%.

The vast majority of posts I see about them have them stable up into the 900+ KH/s region. If I start to tweak my settings beyond 1000/1350, the system almost immediately locks up, or GPU2 suddenly becomes "sick" in cgminer and the whole system has to be rebooted. For some reason my TC has to say at 40960 or else the system locks up. I've tried lower settings (2560 shaders * 8 + 1= 20481), but the system just freezes almost immediately.

One thing I am noticing about every one of these systems that are pulling 900+ KH/s is that they are *all* running windows. Every single one of them. So, for those of you who have tried both, do you recommend windows over BAMT if you aren't worried about a simple templatized drop-in OS?

Edit:

Other info -

* 4GB DDR3
* Sempron 145
* MSI 970A-G43 MoBo
* 3x Sapphire TRI-X radeon R9 290 (with hynix memory) 




 So.. which one do I hook my dvi cable to? Before when I did this it was for radiology workstations where you had a primary card, and then secondary card(s). So which one do I connect to? The top 16x slot? 




 LOL
Well, that's the second vendor I had tell me they had power supplies in stock, and then tell me they were sorry, and they didn't have them in stock and had to have them sent from the manufacturer, who "was having trouble meeting demand." So, I took the advice of a few shibes on here and picked up 2 850w power supplies at best buy for a lower price and overall more power output. I also picked up a crate, and had EVERYTHING ready to go.

However, why am I posting here instead of working on my sweet new mining rig?

I don't have a DVI cable, and my cards didn't come with DVI/VGA adapters. LOL.

At the very least I have one at work that I can use, so I'll get about 1.5 days of good mining before the halvening happens :) 




 Hey everyone. One thing that seems to keep coming up is the idea of making cash via trading. I am totally down with that. What is not cool, though, is people doing it without being informed.
For instance, can you read a candlestick chart? Do you have a plan to minimize risk? These are some pretty basic things.

The best way to learn them is through looking up online courses and tutorials about foreign exchange trading (FOREX). Basically, forex was traditionally trading dollars for euros, or dollars for yen, and vice versa. Then you'd take advantage and trade back to make money. Sound familiar? It's the exact same thing as trading cryptos, except the tools are a little more rudimentary (they don't have to be, but people haven't built something like metatrader for cryptos yet). Plus, unlike trading traditional fiat currencies, you can actually mine cryptos.

**Here are some small things that are helpful to know:**

* When you make a trade, define a point you want to exit, and commit to that.
* Try to never commit more than 2% of your total resources to a particular trade. It sucks to lose 2% on a trade, it sucks way more to lose 100%.
* Never trade on news. Seriously. The whole halvening thing? That's news. Stay away from it like it's the plague. Wait for the market to settle back down or you could see yourself getting nasty burnt. Don't believe me? Look at what happens to the candlestick charts of currency pairs like the Eurodollar whenever the Fed gives a statement. Trading on news can be profitable, but most of the time, it will leave you cold and broke.
* Keep your emotions in check. Always. They will lie to you. Do your best to use cold logic and numbers.
* If the crypto markets ever evolve to the point where you can use stop losses, USE THEM.
* Hedge your bets. Keep a variety of things in reserve. A mix of long term investment plus some trading is usually more successful than just exclusively trading.


**Here are some places to learn more about forex and currency trading:**

* http://www.babypips.com/school
* http://www.ufxmarkets.com/learn/forex-school

**This is a great guide on learning how to read charts (which are your best friend if you want to be successful in trading):**

* http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:introduction_to_cand

**Another thing to keep in mind**, both IOS and android have free FOREX trading games you can download which use actual historical numbers between currency pairs. You can play with them and start to understand patterns of the market and improve your trading before you ever move a doge out of your wallet. It's invaluable practice. Some of them even have "news" events which can show you how a market moves when news comes out. 




 This is a pretty basic question. When you use cryptsy's auto-sell feature, what does it sell the coin for? Does it trade it in to "cryptsy points"? Does it trade it for BTC? If you have a bunch of TIPS, does it trade it for LTC and then trade that for BTC (there's no TIPS/BTC pair)? Their documentation doesn't say much, just that it "automatically sells." 




 Out of curiousity, when you go to sites like:
dogeaddress.org
liteaddress.org
bitaddress.org

Do you have to do anything to add the wallet to the blockchain? Or does simply sending coins to that generated address make it exist? If there's no central addressing point, how are collisions avoided? 




 http://blog.fiverr.com/fiverr-now-accepting-bitcoins

Interesting article - maybe once they get used to using cryptos they'd be a good place to look at convincing to accept Doge! 




 So, how do you all do it? Do you keep a ledger? A spreadsheet? I started keeping a notebook, but thanks to multipool I have a ton of other smaller cryptos which I don't really feel a need to track.

It'd be awesome if someone made something like "mint.com" for your cryptos. 




 YAY! They look beautiful. Now when my power supply shows up I can actually kick off the mining :)

 




 So, I'm waiting for my last few parts to arrive for my mining rig; not just for Dogecoin, but any other altcoin (I'm also really interested in Curecoin when it comes out). I am doing this as part of a side business I own because I thought it would be another revenue stream. I love dogecoin and its community, but I will admit I am here to make profit too. My goal is to use a multipool to mine whatever is most profitable, and convert to USD (either through straight to buyer sales or through exchanges), right now that's doge, but who knows after the halvening. I've done the math. Even if things go south I should be able to make my money back. Plus I've got the hard asset; 3 R9 290's, the RAM (mobo and cpu won't be worth squat, but meh). And by done the math I don't mean just using a calculator, I mean doing a linear regression to figure out the probable difficulty in 1 year based on trends and using that for calculating out profit. I'm in the clear. On the low end, the system should pay for itself in 1 quarter.

The thing is, other folks who thought it was a neat venture are hearing the news about MtGox and are starting to PM me about it that I'm heading into failure. I'm hearing "well aren't all of those coins the same?" constantly. I'm getting tired of explaining it to people. I've always been really good at divorcing myself from emotions when it comes to money things and letting the math guide me, but this time, they're starting to wear me down a bit. My wife especially. I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of this post, other than just some venting. Any thoughts or inspiring words shibes? 




 Just curious about this; I know that the satoshi is a fraction of a bitcoin, so we basically track the value of dogecoin against BTC. Is there a reason for that? 




 Well, I was set to have my rig built this afternoon, but then tigerdirect notified me that they don't actually carry stock anymore; they drop ship everything. Which sucks. They were the company I was going to get my power supply from.

So, I cancelled my order with them, and ordered from another company; rush processing, 2 day shipping. I got a call from them a few minutes ago that their shipment of power supplies never came in, but they expect it to be in on monday. Maybe.

So, as of today I have every single part except a power supply, and given that most places seem to have anywhere from a 2 week to 6 month backlog on 1500w power supplies, I'm annoyed. I was hoping to start mining before the halvening to get at least a few days of peak mining out of it. Boo.

There are no freys or microcenters nearby to check out, so it looks like I am stuck waiting.

I wish vendors would simply state whether or not they have an item. Not list it as available when they "expect a shipment to come in," or when "we think our 3rd party warehouse may have it available, maybe."

Such frustration. Many sad. 




 Well, how do you go about doing it? Right now I'm looking at both Vault of Satoshi and Coinbase. Coinbase will require me to trade doge for BTC (so there's a fee there at some exchange), and then on top of that they charge a percentage fee, and they tack on a .15 "bank fee." But I can withdraw anytime day or night to my business account.

Vault of Satoshi requires me writing them an email, hoping they respond, but it looks like that would be free if I just get a paper check. However, time could be a factor here since I was hoping to get at least a weekly payout.

I'm looking to mine 24x7, withdraw 98% of each day's take as USD daily, and then send the other remaining coins to cold storage wallets.

So, for those of you who do it, how do you manage to keep fees low? What has been your lowest-cost method of converting doge to USD? 




 Just curious - for all of you more experienced miners, is there a noticable difference between using Linux and Windows? What about power utilization?

I ask for two reasons:

* because it seems like doing things like tweaking card performance/voltage is significantly easier inside of windows, whereas with linux you're sort of stuck hoping your miner can make the changes which may or may not be possible.
* Windows tends to have way more processes running so it would make sense that it would be more power than a minimal linux install.

Any feedback would really be appreciated. 




 Hey everyone. So, 4 days ago I felt like I hit the lottery when I saw a 1500w power supply for sale at tigerdirect, and in stock! I placed the order, and waited.

Then I got an update: order submitted to drop shipper. WTF? Tigerdirect is drop shipping now? Seriously?

So, I've been waiting.
And waiting.
And waiting.
Still no update. Every time I call tigerdirect they say that the order is being handled by the drop shipper, and the drop shipper has to meet the same shipping timeframe. I paid for 3 day shipping. This is the third day.

I'd cancel my order, but everywhere I look there is a 2 week to SIX MONTH waiting period for power supplies. Does anyone have any idea where to purchase them? 









 Hey everyone! So, I'm trying to be objective with this post, so I'll do my best to stay away from opinion type things and stick with hard facts.

So, why do I think that dogecoin is here to stay? 

* **Transaction volume.** With only being around for 2 months, our community has already dwarfed the number of transactions that bitcoin or any other altcoin sees. The ultimate point of a crypto*currency* is for people to **use it**. The suggestion that bitcoin will be hoarded seems to be true; people don't seem to spend it that much. That's great, but if it doesn't get used, people don't have a reason to accept it for transactions. When is the last time you went into a store and saw someone pay with a gold coin? Still, people stock up on them. So what they've done is turn it into a commodity instead of a currency. There's nothing inherently good or bad about that, but part of what makes a crypto-currency work is people using it as, well, a currency.

* **Our community.** It's awesome. Simple as that. When I first heard about doge in december, I wrote it off as another fad on 4chan that would go away in 2-3 days, especially when I saw people throwing around tens of thousands of coins in a shot. Plus, that was paired with a lot of rhetoric about getting rich from people who didn't really seem to understand how currency exchange, or economics worked in general. But, here we are! And oh man, this community is driving it forward. People are using paper wallets to spread the word. People are getting businesses to accept Dogecoin. People are starting businesses to support the community. People are getting netted in with pervasive tipping. That all points to this digging in for the long haul. Add into that all of the charity, which I'll talk about more in the next point, and I think it all points to good things in the future. Every 10 minutes you see a new reddit thread about a new shibe coming to the community.

* **Our branding.** Originally, I thought it was silly to use a meme as the basis for a currency. The people who were evangelizing dogecoin kept saying that it would succeed because it's cute and appealing. I thought that it ultimately would be shrugged off as unprofessional by most of the world. To be honest, I still think that it may be eventually (maybe a rebrand of an epic Shibe standing on a cliff, a-la-Lion King), but for now I appear to be wrong. See, half of what made things like siri successful is the goofy stuff you can do with it ("do you love me siri?"). We've become like the counterpoint to the way-too-stern bitcoin community. Where they're talking about smashing iPhones and boycotting apple because an app was banned, we're talking about sending people to the Olympics, getting aide dogs for kids, and digging wells. We're raising awareness of ourselves not through advertising, but by being a genuine benevolent force in the world. That's really **REALLY** powerful. Plus, we've had a bunch of fun slogans which reel even more people in. TO THE MOON! It's a rallying cry! But more than anything, we have painted ourselves as a powerful force. *Let's do so much good that the world at large doesn't want us to go away.* We're already seeing newsprint in major sources - when's the last time another alt-coin has done that outside of a tech journal?

* **The developers.** Let's give them their due. They had an idea, and it took off. But they've also been able to make hard decisions when necessary. It took cojones of steel to make the hard decision to become inflationary currency. It took willingness to sacrifice part of the community that they were very aware would jump ship when the news hit. And, you know what? A bunch of folks did jump ship. But that's part of leadership - you have to be able to make hard decisions not just for yourself, but for your entire community. They've also decided that we should continue to be a force for social good, and I totally support that.

So, combine all of these things, and I think we've found the crypto-currency recipe for success. We just have to keep going and run the course... **TO THE MOON**!

TL;DR: I think we're here to stay because people are actively using the currency, our community is awesome, we have great branding, and our developers have cojones. 




 So, what would be a realistic number of doge mined daily using 3x Radeon R9 290's at around 900KH/s? I'm just curious what I can expect (approximately obviously) once my rig is finished ~monday. 




 So, I am waiting on 3 of these to arrive:
http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-290TR4G

For the life of me though, I can't find any information about whether or not they're unlocked. When i get them, they'll be put in a rig, and run with BAMT. So, where can I go to find out whether they're unlocked? Will something tell me? Is unlocking important?

I'd really appreciate the help! 




 Simple question, which one is the better choice right now? This will be on a headless mining rig. The only big things I can see in the release notes for 13.10 are that there's additional GUI stuff, which, frankly, I don't really care about. But is there an updated kernel or anything that would make it preferred over the LTS? 




 Hey everyone. I'm going to be getting this MoBo for my mining rig tomorrow. I've read that a lot of motherboards need the 1x to have a jumper wire installed on the PCI slot to see anything in the 1x slot as a video card. Is that the case with these motherboards? 




 Just curious; I have had a heck of a time getting anything related to primecoin running on OSX. I finally managed to get a working miner and wallet using brew and the directions here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/primecoin/comments/1slc8q/primecoin_wallet_and_xolominer_pool_miner_for_osx/

This installs the primecoin wallet to /usr/local/Cellar/primecoin/0.1.2xpm.

But now I can't get the wallet to sync. Apparently there was an update recently, but you can forgo it if you modify Primecoin.conf. The problem is, from what I'm reading, Primecoin.conf doesn't exist by default. I can't find any documentation around about where it could or should be located on OSX.

So, I guess my question is twofold: 
*Why the lack of OSX love? There's a ton of documentation for linux and windows, but there's very little for OSX. 
*And where is primecoin.conf supposed to be located when you follow the instructions in that walkthrough?


Oh, and in case anyone wants to say a mac is "not a real computer" or whatever, I'm a telephony engineer for a fortune 500 telecom, and actively help write standards for the IETF. I'm also an RHCE. I know a real computer when I see one, trust me. 




 Hey! My new rig is using 3 of these GPUs:
http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-290TR4G

According to their docs, it has an 8pin and 6pin power connector built into it. I ordered 2 normal 16x-16x PCI risers, and a single powered 1x-16x pci riser.

Since the GPU has its own power connection, can I just forgo connecting the power plug on the riser and use it like it was unpowered? This is the riser I bought:
http://www.amazon.com/Qody-PCI-E-Extension-Cable-powered/dp/B00FQJ077Q

Any feedback would be really helpful; I'm just trying to make sure I don't burn anything out. 














 Simple question; today I have had 4 deposits sent to cryptsy. Nothing seems to be showing up. For Doge, I can see the transactions in block explorer, but there's still no "transactions out." I know scrypt requires a bunch of verifications, but I've still usually received coins to my wallet within 10-15 minutes. 




 This is my first sale, so sorry about the low rep. I've had this game sitting in my inventory for years and it's time someone got to enjoy it! 




 Hello! So, I'm trying to figure out dogetipbot. The "answer a lot of repeated questions" post I found doesn't actually answer a lot of my questions... like, how do I start using it? How does it know where to send and receive dogecoins to/from? Is there a silly noob post explaining it?

I'm still kind of new to reddit, so, this may be something really easy that I'm just not getting, lol :) 




 Eep. Here's hoping it can pay for itself, or I'm going to owe a lot of explaining to the Mrs. So, here are the parts:

**video**
3x [Sapphire TRI-X AMD Radeon R9 290 OC](http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?p=AT-290TR4G c=pw hash=510dY3r8l1Wto8S1V8hVdR0jLFvVFgNtVEuY502sas2Zu%2B4yBhuoU3RRMm8Qu3IJXObxWaOMJp56fbOtRGb8pXEHIELDkrlpnAZIpwLfw39CDudlYy00KS1IXH8%2Feg) - Apparently the order includes a free gift of 3x [Sapphire AMD Radeon R7 240 2GB](http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-R724BT2) - *$1,805*

**CPU, MEM, MOBO**
1x [AMD Sempron 145](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103888)
1x [Kingston 4GB 240-Pin DDR3 1333](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820239309)
1x [MSI 970A-G43 AM3+](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130679)
Total: *$167*

**Power**
1x [SilverStone Strider Series 1500w Modular Power Supply](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=6624651) - *$365*

**Misc**
4x Risers (2 1-16x powered, 2 16x-16x), milk crate, kill-a-watt wall meter, ATX power switch,  16GB USB3 stick - *$125*

Original plan was for the 3x 290's, but if I get the free R7's as well, one of those will be going in too. The others will get resold.

Thoughts? Total came to around $2462. Assuming 4 cards, it should put out about 3000KH/s. 









 Hey everyone; I am looking to purchase a mining rig for mining Scrypt coins, but I'm trying very hard to ensure that I get a return on investment. However, I am very concerned about dumping the cash on several GPUs only to have ASICs suddently become widely available. With things like dualminer coming out, and now gridseed's product, what sort of threat do you think do they present to not just Doge, but all scrypt mining?

I have always read that Scrypt would be nearly impossible to mine with ASICs because memory usage can be increased to make them prohibitively expensive, but yet here they are starting to appear on market. 




 Hey everyone! Just trying to figure this out; dogecoin-qt has said for the past 8 hours or so that it's at 100% (or at least the little progress bar says so). However the wallet still says it's out of sync. I'm using osx mavericks... just not sure what's going on. Anyone else have experience with the dogecoin client on a mac? 




 Hey everyone, it's another one of those posts that you all love! This is meant to be a first foray into mining. I'm starting with 2 GPUs and scaling up from there. Ultimately I'd think this could handle up to 4.

* Motherboard:
MSI 970A-G43 AM3+ AMD 970 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX

I'll be running xubuntu off the USB storage. Any suggestions on tweaks? This brings the price to about $1584 with an estimated 1600 KH/s based on the hardware comparisons I've seen. I'm also estimating power should be around 600w at the wall? Should I look into a larger power supply? Any feedback would be appreciated.

This box will be sitting in my basement on my workbench chugging away 24x7x365 (hopefully). 




 Hey everyone. I am new to litecoin mining, and I'm trying to do the math to see whether or not it is worth it to get started. I am using this calculator:
http://www.coinwarz.com/calculators/litecoin-mining-calculator

Assumptions:
I'm assuming purchasing 3 HD7990's (I work for a large telecom company and can likely get better deals than the average joe), but I'm assuming a hardware cost of $4k and a hash rate of 3000 KH/s.
I'm assuming a 1250 watt power supply, and our power costs $0.11/kWh.
I'm assuming a 1% pool fee (I don't have a pool picked out yet).
I've kept the default block reward of 50 because I'm too new to figure out quite how this works.

Calculations:
For difficulty, I took the chart and history here:
http://bitcoinwisdom.com/litecoin/difficulty
and did some number crunching. I defined X as the number of days since 8/15/2013, and Y as the difficulty.
First, I figured out the slope and intercept based on those numbers.
Based on the data listed, the slope comes out to approximately 17.9 difficulty/day, and the intercept is at 306. Then it was just a matter of plugging it into slope-intercept form (y=m*x+b), where x is 535 days (the number of days between february 1, 2015 and 8/15/2013) which gave me a difficulty of 9884 one year from now.
I did a linear regression and the math seems to jive.

ROI:
So that's what I popped in to the calculator. Using these numbers, it is showing a profit of approximately $1.4k over the year. Since this is basing the entire year off of what the difficulty is estimated at a year from now, it could potentially be much more (current difficulty is around 2500).

So, does this math seem correct? I'm trying to be conservative because I'm showing it to the Mrs to justify why I'd be spending it. Any feedback would be helpful.

Also, this is assuming only litecoin is mined, and no money is sunk into ASIC mining devices if/when they come out.

 Hey everyone. As of this morning, thanks to an idiot HIT requestor, my approval rating is down to 98.1%. I took several of their HITs, in which you had to identify "objectionable" images. They included a warning which stated there would be between 20-50 objectionable images in the lot, and if you selected more than 50, you would have your hit rejected.

So I ended up being presented with about 5 hits, each with scores of penis pictures (no joke). Each one had tons of "objectionable" images based on the requestors requirements, so there was no way to supply the required information without exceeding their 50 image threshold. As of this morning, I logged in to find out every single one had been rejected; each one stating "you missed N different images." So, not only would I have had to flag 70+ images on each HIT, but I would have had to go directly against their warning. Since i'm new to HWTF and a lot of the mturk lists, I wasn't familiar with TO until last evening; now I see the requestor has horrible ratings across the board.

So, any advice on how to pump back up my approval rating? Some 1 cent HITS that take a second to do would be the best I suppose? 




 Exactly what the title says. I am still new to using SB, and I've been looking into ways to get it to run automatically (experience with *nix, so I've had some ideas but was hoping to find something canned). I have seen lots of posts about SB not running correctly in daemon mode on OSX ML, but most of the posts are a year+ old. Is this still an issue? Looking through the changelog didn't have any clues. 




 Hi everyone. I have been going nuts trying to solve this. I want to use Rosetta stone on a mac mini, which sits in my entertainment center functioning as a HTPC. To do this, I need a wireless sound input device. I don't need sound output - I am using the HDMI port and outputting sound directly to my TV. That all works fine. I just can't find a wireless input solution. I have tried an old pair of Dell BH200 bluetooth headphones which used to work just fine for this purpose 3 years ago, but apparently the bluetooth stack is less versatile now.

I had my job purchase me a plantronics M165 bluetooth headset, and it does pair properly with the mac. But the aggressive power saving that it uses causes the microphone to stop working after 2-3 seconds of silence. So, when rosetta stone attempts to open the sound input channel (repeat the word after me sort of situation), it suddenly sees the device as offline. Approximately half the time, it causes rosetta stone to freeze up, or spit out an error and force close.

I don't know what to do. Apple has been no help whatsoever on this. The only wireless microphones I can find that aren't bluetooth cost well over 150$ and are designed for conferencing.

All I have been getting are suggestions to use a USB mic, or a wired mic. That will be incredibly messy in the living room (the last thing I need is another wire in the entertainment center, especially one that can stretch across the entire room). Is this really such a weird use case? 




 Hey everyone. I recently purchased a late '12 Mac Mini to serve as a HTPC. So far, it has worked great. However one of the goals was to use it as a hub for family software and distance learning (stuff like Rosetta stone, and some distance language classes). The goal is to remain completely wireless (would you really want to be tethered by a wired microphone 3 inches from a 51" plasma screen? Those things get HOT!). I have an apple magic mouse, a logitech k760 keyboard and they both work great with bluetooth.

The issue is sound IO. I need sound to go out of the mac mini via HDMI to my TV. This works just great. But sound input? That's an issue. I haven't been able to track down a non-bluetooth wireless mic that is less than 150$. If I want to go below that, I have to use bluetooth. That's great, except apparently there are a ton of issues with the bluetooth stack in Lion and Mountain Lion, many of which directly impact bluetooth audio IO. I can pair a wireless headset in stereo mode, but the instant I try to activate the mic in the sound input pref pane, I receive a "your bluetooth device has encountered an error" dialog. This happens in both Mountain Lion and Lion.

Thinking it could be because I am using an older headset (3.5 whole years! a Dell Bh200 stereo headset), I had work order me a new bluetooth earbud - a plantronics a170 headset. This is the same one apple sells. I connect it to my mac and it works great - until I try to activate the mic. As soon as I do, spinning beachball, and then error.

Looking at the apple discussion forums, there are hundreds of threads about bluetooth issues (like this one: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3200456?start=0 tstart=0), but no comprehensive solution, and the overall consensus seems to be that the apple bluetooth stack is a cluster****. 

Suggestions from apple geniuses were hilarious - "the bluetooth device is broken!" So I paired it with windows, a blackberry, and an android. "There aren't any known issues with the bluetooth stack in OSX." So I showed them several 20+ page discussions on their own discussion boards. "You aren't using an apple supported bluetooth device!" So I did the same demo with the Plantronics headset and showed them the place where it is sold on their site. "You need to purchase an iSite webcam with a built in mic!" Um, no. Bad fanboy, no skinnyjeans.

So, after much research, one of the suggestions was using an aftermarket bluetooth dongle, which should shut off the internal bluetooth adapter on the mac. Why would you want to do this? The internal bluetooth adapter has several key bluetooth device profiles missing in mountain lion and lion, like handsfree. An external adapter should include support for all of them. If that's true, it may resolve my issues.

The internal adapter is a Broadcom BCM20702. I'd like to use a 4.0 dongle for future-proofing, but the only known mac-compatible one I have found that isn't completely documented in Chinese is from IOGear. The chipset it uses? Broadcom BCM20702A0. So, same chipset, possibly a different firmware update. Most likely it will exhibit the same problems. There is also an iogear bluetooth 2.1+EDR but I can't find any explanation of the chipset.
2.1+EDR should work for the magic mouse, keyboard, and both of the bluetooth headsets, I just need to know that the devices won't have any issues pairing after coming out of sleep (it is a HTPC and needs to be easy for the fiancee to use, that includes devices waking up).

I am left with a ton of questions and almost no answers -

-Can I use a mono bluetooth headset JUST as a mic, while using the normal audio out for sound?

-If not, are there any wireless microphones available for less than 100$ that are known to work?

-Do you think the wireless dongle hardware will exhibit the same issues if I pick up the IOgear 4.0 one?

-Is there any way to add additional bluetooth profiles to the built in bluetooth adapter?

-Is this really THAT weird of a use case? Wireless audio input? Why is it this hard? 
























 So I am playing through the lessons and I simply cannot get 100 percent on any of the practice tracks. Specifically, once I get up to the 12th fret and higher rocksmith has a really hard properly recognizing notes.

For instance, in the shifting lesson, it asked me to play the 15th fret. So I did. It kept complaining that I was hitting the 16th fret. I had to play the 14th fret to pass that part.

It is especially bad in the sustain track because it simply refuses to acknowledge that I have hit the 12th fret notes at all unless I pick the string way harder than should really be necessary.

I have my pickup selector set to the neck pickup. I have the pickup volume the whole way up. I have increased the line in input in my mixer settings. I have recalibrated and retuned (both with rocksmith as well as my snark clip on tuner). I've tried tuning at both the neck and the 12th fret (guitar geek tip - tune by playing at the 12th fret). Everything should be working. But it isn't. 

Anyone else run into this?? 




 I just noticed this a few minutes ago. I had planned on getting my parents a gift card for christmas, and I realized that they don't seem to be available at either site anymore.

Did I miss the memo, or is there a system down somewhere or what? 




 Pretty simple question I hope. I have been dying for black pudding but for the life of me I can't find it in the US. I have decided to make it for myself.

However out of 3 butchers, 0 would sell me pig blood. One told me it is illegal to sell. That sounds... strange.

I found an ethnic Asian market that sells it frozen, but I know ethnic markets can sometimes play a little fast and loose with legality. Not that I care if they have what I need, lol.

So, does anyone know? Is it really illegal to sell pig blood in the US? 




 What the title says.

We use capital one 360 and have one checking and a ton of savings accounts (its how we handle budgeting).

I know if I transfer out of a savings account to checking it counts toward the monthly limit, but I don't believe I have ever seen a notice when transferring between savings accounts. 




 Hey everyone! I'm in the process of planning out my wife and I's first at-home Christmas dinner. We got tired of figuring out whose family/friends/whatever we were supposed to attend each year and decided to just spend it together.

As of now I'm working on putting together the menu. Obviously this is a special meal so I am going all out.

Appetizer:
??

Lemon sorbet in between

Main course:

* Crown rack of lamb
* Couscous with nuts, fruit
* garlic custard
* asparagus bundles tied with bacon

Cheese plate: 

* Roquefort or stilton
* Cabot clothbound cheddar
* Camembert
* Some TBD hard cheese
* Some TBD chevre or sheep milk cheese

Dessert:
Chocolate mousse, a lemon curd tart, creme brulee or a tart tatin and espresso

Wine pairing:
* cote du rhone
* Chateau Ste Michelle Eroica (her favorite)

So, I have most of it planned out. There are a few things TBD the one I am having the most trouble with is the appetizer.

I know traditionally it should be a soup or salad. I'd like to go a bit beyond a salad, so I'm trying to think of soups. 

Any suggestions? Any other ideas for apps that would fit? 




 Pretty simple question. It's nice enough that Rocksmith shows you hand positioning, but some songs seem to have kind of wonky finger positioning that doesn't really make sense with the positioning. 

It seems like tremolos show you the finger, but otherwise it doesn't really seem to help too much. 




 So, I've always had an issue with the occasional muscle spasm. Usually it's minor, and it doesn't happen frequently. But every now and then I'll be practicing and one of my fingers will have a single solitary "twitch."

Now, i've never been to a doctor for it because it is pretty seldom, but it does seem to happen more often when I'm using my hands - like when I'm playing guitar.

So, does anyone else have this problem? How have you overcome it? Thus far it hasn't really impacted my practicing, but I'd love to understand what it is and how to ensure it never does impact my practicing. 




 Hey everyone. I grabbed CDLC for 21st Century Digital Boy (bad religion), which was PC only. I used the toolkit to convert to mac.

At the song select screen, the song shows up. The music plays. When I select the song, the "rocksmith recommends" stuff all shows up properly, tuning shows up, etc. When I press play, if it's the first song, the tuner will show up. If i'm already in standard E, it won't.

At this point through something weird happens. The foreground graphics all fade away, leaving just the background (and the amp stacks on the sides of the screen). Then it just sits there. Hitting escape/enter/whatever doesn't work. The game stays responsive, but it just sits there with no way to escape.

I've had to force quit trying it 4 times now, so it's definitely repeatable. Could it be an issue with the CDLC? Or maybe something went wrong during the conversion from PC to Mac? It's the only one I've had an issue with so far! 




 Hey everyone. This is impacting me on both Classical and Electric guitar. During warmups and initial practice my fret hand has no issues. For classical, my thumb placement is exactly where it should be, behind the second fret (first position). I'm sitting correctly, guitar in my lap at a 10 degree angle (ish) learning in to my body and at an ascending angle.

With electric, my position is a bit more sloppy and relaxed. Usually I'm sitting on a couch or chair and playing whatever feels most comfortable at the time (the electric is more for fun and less for serious study for me right now).

Either way, after about 30 minutes or so, my fret hand starts to ache. I find myself squeezing the fretboard a lot, so I'm wondering if this is causing it?

My classical guitar teacher has suggested letting gravity pull my hand down on to the string as opposed to exerting force, but when i do that I tend to get buzzing more than clear notes. He also suggested bringing my fret hand's arm's elbow tighter in to my body, but still, not much improvement. Other than that, he said my form is fine. So I'm kind of at a loss.

I'm a relatively new player - about 6 months, so could this just be simple muscle fatigue that will go away? Is there something else I could be doing wrong? Any other ideas would be really appreciated. Usually I can just shake out my hand and it goes away, but there have been a few times where it has caused me to cut my practicing a bit short. Since I've been practicing more and more lately, it has been limiting me more and more. 




 A buddy is letting me long-term-borrow his fender deluxe player strat. There are the 3 pickup knobs, and the normal pickup selector switch. There is also a button which has no label. Since it's used, there's no guide with the guitar. For the life of me, I can't find anything on google other than it controls pickups. I don't know what it does exactly.

The official fender blurb says: "The powerful Deluxe Players Strat guitar is set apart from the pack by features [...] standard five-way pickup switch paired with push/push mini-switch offering an even greater variety of pickup combinations, brown shell pickguard and gold-plated vintage hardware."

Which, is great for saying what it's supposed to do, but how the heck does it work? So, can anyone help an ignorant newbie? :) 




 Hey everyone. I have been taking classical fingerstyle lessons for about 6 months now, and feel somewhat accomplished with it.

I have been planning to start dabbling in rock and jazz for awhile (I figured learning rock and jazz with the full knowledge of theory behind it would be awesome). A buddy is letting me long-term-borrow his fender strat to start doing just that. Well, as a gift my wife picked me up RS2014, and I now have it fully decked out. The thought was it would give me the ability to practice stuff that isn't from the book, let me start playing around with other styles, and most importantly keep the guitar in my hand.

I have no plan to stop taking lessons.

So, who else out there takes guitar lessons in addition to playing RS? Are there any teachers or students out there who can provide information or tips about this approach? I want to play with both, but I don't want to sabotage my lessons. I want RS to be an enhancement to my learning.

My guess is I need to focus a lot on the guitarcade because it doesn't so much teach songs as it does teach techniques that are always important. The songs should just be a fun addition. What does everyone else think? 




 So, I've been messing with the guitarcade in RS2014, but I'm getting kind of frustrated that to learn, I play through (but usually fail pretty fast).

The problem is, after I lose, I have to watch the losing animation, watch a game over screen, watch a high scores screen, go to the title screen, "make some noise," wait for opening animations, etc.

Is there any way I can skip all of that stuff and get right back to gameplay? It's annoying having 45 seconds of downtime between each attempt. 




 Pretty much what I put in the title. I've been studying fingerstyle for awhile, and had an opportunity pop up to get an Fender Strat (a buddy is considering selling it, but isn't sure if he really wants to, so I am "long term borrowing" while he decides if he can live without it or not).

This works for me, because in a few months I want to pick up a hollowbody to start venturing more into Jazz and rockabilly.

So, now I have this thing, I don't know where to go first. I tried fingerpicking but it started gouging the hell out of my nails, so I'll be picking up some new alaska piks soon. Are there any good books for jazz that I can start with? This is less serious study and more for fun, so I'd love to hear everyone's opinions. Something for jazz fingerpicking would be spectacular because it's what I'm most comfortable with. 




 Pretty much exactly what the title says. What do you find yourself buying most often? Picks? Reeds? Strings? Cork oil? Cables?

I want to start with basics musicians always need, and then eventually start moving towards larger items (things that are tough and expensive to build up an inventory of initially). 




 As of this evening I'm borrowing a buddy's Les Paul studio that he never plays (he is considering selling it but isn't sure, and figures it will give him a chance to see if he really never uses it if I long-term-borrow). It gives me a chance to futz around on an electric before I make the jump on a hollowbody next year.

Pretty simple question - does anyone know of a current deal on RS2014 for pc/mac? I know I'm a week late, but maybe someplace still has a cyber-week sale going on.

If I can find the core game, I'll order one of the cables separately. Otherwise I'll be ordering the physical bundle. 




 It arrived yesterday. My wife and I have been fed up with replacing 1 to 2 coffee machines a year for years, and getting consistently terrible support.

So, we figured the time had come, so we took advantage of the 20% sale at Williams-Sonoma and placed our order.

My first impressions - I like how it's built. While it will be a pain in the ass for folks who hate washing small parts, for kitchen clean freaks like the wife and I, it's awesome. It also shows you what you're paying for - a crazy pump and heating element, with some well designed plastic parts to hold and drip coffee through.

I had the first brew this morning, and I had mixed results. I made enough for 10 cups of coffee, using their guideline of 7tbsp (usually we each have 2 mugs of coffee a morning, and measuring it out with water that was about what was needed). The coffee came out surprisingly timid taste-wise (not the coffee maker's fault, I have to dial it in). I used a paper filter instead of a mesh filter, so the mouthfeel was slightly diminished from what I'm used to. I'll pick up a new filter today.

Despite the first pot being a little light, I will say that it packed a hell of a punch of caffeine. I had to be up for work at 4:30, and about 10 minutes after finishing my travel mug I got a very noticable jolt. I weigh 230 lbs. That almost never happens with coffee, especially cheap bulk beans from sams club (I don't use "the good stuff" until I have it dialed in). This could have been psychosomatic, but it was noticable to me.

So far, I am very impressed, I just have to dial in the right amount of coffee to use. It looks great, albiet a little industrial.  I also like the 5 year guarantee - at the rate we were replacing pots this alone makes the ticket price worth it. 




 Hey everyone. Like lots of folks, I got involved with cryptocurrency during the boom last december. However, much of the time between then, and honestly, even now, I was flying by the seat of my pants and guiding myself with back-of-napkin math. I didn't keep much in the way of records.

Since getting involved, a number of the parties I've worked with have shuttered their doors, gone bankrupt, or worse (gone rogue resulting in lots of losses that I've more or less shrugged off). With these places closing their doors, I've lost the ability to get records of the transactions to/from them. I still earn some bitcoin weekly through online mining contracts.

So, my issue is I'd like to try and comply with the IRS advisory, but I simply lack most of the records I would need to comply. I'm not really sure what to do. Part of me wants to take the paltry sum of bitcoin that I have now (as in this moment, it's small, about $200 USD) and set it aside, and start keeping immaculate records.

The benefit of doing that is I can start freely converting some of my earnings back to USD so long as I pay taxes on the capital gains/losses, which is a good thing right? If I am correct - I pay taxes on the income the day that the bitcoin is received, and then if it is held, I pay taxes on the capital gains between the day it is received and the day it is used for another financial transaction.

However, I haven't been able to get any real information about how to do my taxes. What forms do I need? Usually I do my taxes with turbotax, but I'm guessing that is out of the question? For a non-tax-pro, the whole advisory is really confusing and I don't really know where to begin if I want to go "green field" and start keeping immaculate records.

I just need advice about what to do and how to best proceed. I've tried starting a conversation about this in /r/bitcoin but the majority of folks there just say not to bother which is counterproductive. I've also seen folks say to talk to a tax attorney or cpa but the prices in our area dwarf the amount ive earned significantly. 




 So, I've been playing with cryptos for a little over a year now. The issue I have is that in that time, I didn't keep good records. I don't know how much I mined, how much I sent where, etc. Worse, there is a lot that I have lost in places like Gox and Bitcoin-Trader. I can't get records from them. Likewise a number of the altcoin pools I was participating in have dried up and closed their doors, so I can't account for my transactions from them.

All said, I honestly don't know how to handle the taxes.

So, what I'm considering doing is sending everything I currently have to a paper wallet, and starting to keep detailed records from that day forward (kind of a "green field" approach). At least then I can be somewhat in compliance. Is this a good/bad idea? I'm in the US and the reporting requirements are confusing to say the least. 




 Hey everyone!
Hopefully this is my last pre-purchase question. I'm pretty sure I'm getting rocksmith and rocksmith 2014, but now I'm torn between PS3 and PC.

PS3 seems like it is the easiest to get up and running. PC, by nature of being a more open platform, should give me more versatility - stuff like custom DLC (I really want more jazz stuff to be included, and this seems like the only option).

Are there any other major differences I need to be aware of between the two?? 




 Hey everyone. I am interested in picking up ricksmith and rocksmith 2014. I am currebtly studying classical guitar, but I feel that this could help me pick up the guitar a bit morw and in a different way.

I have seen several articles mention that in rocksmith 2014 you can pay to download the song library from the original rocksmith if you have it already.

Does this require that I have a copy of the original rocksmith? Or can I just buy rocksmith 2014 and download the original rocksmith's song library as dlc?

This is for PS3 




 Simple question I hope. I am re-outfitting my GT Transeo 2.0 to be a training bike. As part of that, I picked up a lower end cycle computer that had gotten thumbs up for rear mounting.

Now, I'm having a hell of a time getting the spedometer sensor to work correctly. My bike uses disk brakes, so the chainstays and seatstays are extremely wide. According to the manufacturer, the spoke magnet and the sensor have to pass within 1-3mm of each other (2 business cards thickness). There simply is no where on the frame of my bike where that is possible. Even at the hub (if the disk brakes weren't blocking me from putting it there) there is still about a half inch between the magnet and the sensor.

The only place I've found that gets the sensor close enough to the spoke magnet is on the sheathing to the brake line right before it goes into the disk brake mechanism. If I mount the sensor there, it finally is close enough to the magnet that it can pick it up. My major concern is that the zip ties will restrict movement of the brake line.

I am also considering beefing up the magnet by using some neodymium magnets - i just have to find a way to hold them. 














 Over the weekend I picked up a several games. The Jak and Daxter collection, The Ratchet and Clank collection, Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends, Lego Hobbit, and GTA5. Well over the 100$ requirement. However I haven't seen anything from Sony about the credit they promised for spending over 100$. 




 Hey everyone!
My wife, for christmas, is getting me a set of rollers for my bike. She let me know, so we can pick them out together. Right now I'm looking at Elite Atrion mag rollers. It's on sale at Performance Bicycle for black friday, and it seems like a good option. Has anyone

Truth is, I've got a sedentary job, and I've gained about 55lbs since I started working there 5 years ago. I've been trying to lose weight. We have a very good treadmill, but I seriously can't stand running anymore (I've run 2 half marathons, my knees can't take it with the weight, and my mind can't take the boredom). I can get an OK workout by walking/wogging on the treadmill, but I just enjoy my bike more.

I have a GT Transeo 2.0 hybrid with the stock tires. I've been told that the tires will work, but I should look at getting some smooth tires. Is there any truth to that?

I'm also thinking about getting some kind of cycle computer to monitor cadence/speed, but what other features should I look at? I feel like GPS would be wasted because I won't be using the computer while I'm outside riding. What other training specific features would be helpful? Are there any models anyone can recommend? For heart rate, I've got a Polar F11 (it's old but it works great). 




 Well, our turkey cooked far faster than expected for a 23lb bird. It is now done nearly 2 hours earlier than expected.

Will storing it in a cooler dry things out? 




 This is something that has been bothering me for awhile - why do so many people make the assumption that women cook and men don't? What defines our biases associated with foods and who we think is "good" at making them?
 
I'll give an example. I spent all day making a series of dishes for a community meeting. Everything 100% from scratch, slow food style, so when I say from scratch I mean as close to scratch as I can reasonably come. Stromboli with homemade mozz, sauce, homegrown veggies, home ground sausage, etc. The yeast was the only thing that came in a package. Fruit leathers from berries I picked. Cupcakes filled with home brewed chocolate stout cream. Things that took a long time and a ton of effort.

I show up to the meeting, and the first response I hear after "this is amazing!" is "Please tell your wife this food was awesome!" I was fit to be tied.

We regularly have pot lucks at work, and it happens there too. Muesli cookies? Apple pie from hand picked apples and home milled flour and home churned butter crust? Vanilla bourbon salt caramels? Again, people seem incredulous that I, not my wife, made it. "You made this!?"

It feels like a huge slap in the face. Yes I freaking made it! Spending hours tweaking something to get it perfect only to have someone assume that you didn't do it because you have a penis really, really sucks. I am exacting with cooking. I have a deep sense of pride in what I cook. I'm passionate about it. If I could do it all over,  I'd have gone into the CIA. So it feels horrible when I get that doubtful "yeah, right" look after I explain that my wife didn't make something.

I just don't get it. People love celeb chefs like Alton Brown, Robert Irvine, Bobby Flay, and more. So why do so many people on the whole seem to assume that men generally cannot cook?

The crazy thing is, there is an inverse to this. If it is grilled or bbq, the assumption is I'm the one responsible, even though my wife is excellent at grilling.

Has anyone else experienced this? How pervasive are these biases? 




 I've wanted one for about 2 years. After wrecking yet another candy thermometer and knowing that I have a massive thanksgiving meal to cook on the horizon, I dug deep and placed the order.

I just got the notice from fedex that it was delivered today.

So, anyone else out there have a thermopen? How do you like it? The reviews are all glowing, but I'd love to know more about how well it has worked for you. 




 Hey everyone. I'm taking advantage of the 1$ galaxy S5's from Best Buy this week to upgrade my wife and I's phones. We are eligible for upgrades as of july of this year, so that isn't a concern.

We currently have 2 lines on an unlimited data plan (the one you can't get anymore). According to best buy, they will just renew the current contract. However when we started stepping through the process online, they say they will just renew the current plan but CONDITIONS MAY APPLY. But no where on the website does it list any kind of conditions, so we haven't pulled the trigger online. We're going to the store tonight instead.

So, does anyone have any idea what those conditions are? Will they force me out of my unlimited data plan as a condition? 




 Hopefully this is a quick, simple question. What is the effective difference between a traditional cleaver and a straight back cleaver ? I can't tell if the curved blade near the front would be helpful or hurt the my normal usage of a cleaver (hacking up carcasses). 

I mean, no front point SHOULD make the second one less likely to be damaged, right?

Examples:

Traditional: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001505OT6

Straight back: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005CFSMVM
 




 Hey everyone. I would like to try my hand at making a tofu press. I was thinking something simple like this:
http://www.amazon.com/EZ-Tofu-Press-Removes-Texture/dp/B007LLGMG2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1416623778 sr=8-1 keywords=tofu+press

What I was wondering about - what would be a good wood for this? End grain like you would use for a butcher block? It's going to be exposed to prolonged periods of pressure against a wet food surface. What kind of finish would work and be safe? 




 I am lucky enough to be very good friends with the son of one of the founders of Ithaca hours. For those who are not familiar, check out the wiki:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca_Hours

The short version - it is a local currency that had had a very large amount of local buy-in from businesses.

I was thinking - wouldn't this be a great model not just for bitcoin, but also for any crypto in general? If bitcoin could start being evangelized at a local level similar results should be attainable, right? Thoughts? 

It seems like a natural fit - all of the usability of a local currency with a high amount of buy-in, PLUS it would be accepted worldwide. 




 Hey everyone!
For a fun little project, I am trying to build a simple little prank circuit comprised of a power supply, a photoresistor, and a piezo buzzer. The idea will be to lay some white tape on the floor, and attach the circuit (in a small project box) to the underside of the chair. This way when the chair rolls over the white line, it makes a buzz.

Now, my question is - how sensitive is a photoresistor? Suppose this circuit is underneath a rolling chair - it will be shading the floor. Is there a better way to detect the white tape? 




 Basically what the subject says.

This year we stocked up on fresh cheap turkeys thanks to the holiday sales, and I spent the past hour breaking them down (nothing fancy, just removing the wings, removing and splitting the legs and thighs, deboning the thighs, and removing the boneless breasts, bagging the carcasses for stock). The legs will probably get turned into pulled turkey, the thighs are going to get stuffed and wrapped in bacon. The breasts will get brined and smoked in the smoker (I'm considering making turkey pastrami but I'm concerned about it getting dry). The wings got set aside - we're using them to make our thanksgiving stuffing.

That said - the real point of this post is - does anyone else find breaking down an animal really therapeutic? Almost zen-like? I'm entirely self taught, but it feels almost like if you "tune out" your hands just innately know where to go. Maybe tune-out is the wrong way to put it because I'm paying 100% attention, but, hopefully I'm getting my point across.

Obviously I'm not breaking down beef primals yet, but I'd love to give it a go one day.

So, does anyone else feel the same way?? 




 Pretty much the subject.

We get Merrick Grain Free duck for our greyhound, and he seems to enjoy it. Via amazon, we were getting it, with tax, for about $47 a bag. The same bag has gone up $9 over 1 month BEFORE tax. We thought it may have just been Amazon, but it seems like every store has seen an increase.

We started looking through other premium brands and saw that prices seem to be up across the board.

Is this a permanent thing? Is it a temporary shortage of some ingredients...? I love our dog, but his food budget is now larger than my wife and I's food budget. 




 Pretty much the situation described in the subject. My wife and I are both 30. We are starting to discuss the possibility of trying to have a baby in the next year. I am currently in my open-enrollment period at work, and have the option to sign up for an FSA. We have no major medical expenses, and only currently purchase vitamins and calcium supplements for my wife.

I'm considering signing up for the flexible spending account and putting 10$ out of each paycheck into it for things like prenatal vitamins, but my concern is that at the end of the year, if we aren't successful, that's essentially money we lose.

So, any insights would be very much appreciated. 




 The subject should sum this up. We're taking advantage of the seasonal prices for 2 fresh turkeys which I'm breaking down into boneless breasts, thighs, and legs to be frozen for future use. The back and rest of the carcass will be boiled down with some chicken carcasses we have frozen for poultry stock.

For the cuts goal will most likely be to thaw and smoke them in the BBQ.

So, is it best to brine before freezing, or brine after freezing the birds? 




 See the subject.
I see tons of the hollowbodies without tremolo for both right and lefty. However the Tim Armstrongs with tremolo only seem to be available for lefties. Is this true, or am I somehow missing the right-handed ones with tremolos? 




 Pretty much the subject. I'm not used to using mobile wallets. I am using one of the HD wallet addresses, and I'm noticing it changes ~once per week. What concerns me is that I'll send a large amount there right after it changes and I'll end up sending bitcoin into the aether.

So, is this how it's supposed to work? Is it a feature of an HD wallet? Is there something I'm missing? Do the old addresses keep working?

Totally newbie questions I'm sure, but I'd love to get an explanation. 




 Hey everyone! So, I'm in the market to purchase a new guitar over the next few months. I'd love to do it with bitcoin, even if it means buying a gift card.

I was looking at amazon as a possible route, but they don't set up guitars for you, and I don't want to spend cash to have it done when it arrives.

I saw that amazon sells Guitar Center gift cards, but they're physical cards in $25 or $50 denominations. I would be kinda ludicrous to go into the store with 20 gift cards, you know?

So are there any places like guitarcenter/musician's friend/dave phillips etc that accept bitcoin? 




 Hey everyone! I was just wondering if anyone had heard anything about the sprint black friday deals this year? I haven't heard anything at all, and usually they'd be published by now. 




 Hey everyone. I've been a sprint customer since 1999, and have basically just been moving from plan to plan inside sprint. My wife and I are now on the same plan for the past 2-3 years.

2 black fridays ago we picked up 2 galaxy S3's (I only buy new phones on black friday since they got rid of the technology upgrade credits and sprint premier benefits). They're starting to get older and clunkier.

Does anyone know if there are going to be black friday specials this year?? Usually they would have been posted by now. 




 Hey everyone. I have an idea for a store to sell products for bitcoin. I wanted to start putting it online, but I am not really familiar with e-commerce solutions.

Initially I will be accepting cryptos, but eventually I would like to start accepting fiat as well.

So, how does it work exactly? Do I just set up any old e-commerce solution? Do payment providers act like plugins?

Sorry if these are newbie questions, but I've never done this sort of design before and I'm a little nervous. 




 Hey everyone! I've been studying classical fingerstyle for the past 6 months, and have really been enjoying it (plus the guys at /r/classicalguitar are really awesome).

Eventually I want to branch into jazz a bit (I still have a lot of learning, but I want to set aside cash so I can get a really nice instrument when I'm ready for it). However, that's where it starts to get a bit fuzzy because I don't know a heck of a lot about steel string guitars.

What would be best to learn on? I mean, Django played on an acoustic. BB King plays on an electric. So, it seems like I've got a ton of options and could really go the acoustic route (which I'm already used to from my classical guitar) OR the electric route (I'd probably be leaning towards a nice semi-hollowbody). Or do I want an acoustic with a resonator? I just don't know!

So, for those who have more experience than me, what would you view as preferable for learning jazz?  









 Hey everyone. Yet another noobie question :)

So, my wife (a professional music teacher) and my classical guitar teacher both tell me that I should try to avoid practicing much more than 30 minutes at a time. This almost never happens - by the time I am done doing hand exercises and warm ups, 15 minutes has usually already passed and I usually end up spending another 45 minutes on material and I still don't feel like I'm mastering it between lessons.

But both the Parkening and Provost books mention practicing for 3 or more hours a day. This is almost impossible given my schedule, but I do feel like I accomplish way more when I can set aside 2+ hours at a time to just work through the material over and over and over at ever-increasing tempos. Is it better to split that large block into several smaller ones?

What is the better approach? A few minutes a day or hours a day? Which will help the material "stick" more? 




 Hey everyone. I am looking to buy a PSMO to break down into filets and a chateaubriand roast. As of last night we scored a great deal on a membership to Sam's club off living social (deal may still be going, it's 45$ for the membership, a 20$ gift card, and 4 vouchers for free items - a rotisserie chicken, 2 baguettes, some dip, and some cookies). I figured this was a golden opportunity to break down some loins.

I went to the butcher case and only saw "beef loins." They had a nice heavy layer of fat so i couldn't see whether or not the chain muscle was attached. So, does anyone know if this is a PSMO or not? They were priced around $70-$90 which would seem about the right price range. There wasn't anyone working the butcher area that I could bounce questions off of. I know BJ's used to actually call them PSMOs so I'm a bit lost here. 




 So, I haven't played Destiny for close to a month. I played through the single player, and ran through each of the strikes. I'm not part of a guild or clan or anything, and due to lack of ability to really communicate meaningfully in game, I couldn't find one in the game. I wasn't looking to have to have 2+ screens open at all time just to play a single game, so I kinda lost interest and stopped playing. So, I just wanted to check in on the status of the game.

First, is there more content, or a better story yet? Or is Rasputin still a seemingly major plot point that is instantly forgotten the instant you leave earth? Does the dude in the Tower now tell you about all of the things he says he COULD tell you about?

Second, is playing the same strikes over and over and over still being masqueraded as content, or have they actually added real beefy content?

Third, have they added any kind of matchmaking to raids to allow players who aren't in clans/guilds to actually have a chance at seeing the content?

Fourth, have they made drop rates any better on blue and better gear so I don't have to run the same strikes/crucible matches 100 times a week to progress in the game?

Fifth, is RNG still as big of a PITA?

Sixth and last - can I finally talk to people for matchmaking? Or do I still have to rely on outside sources like destinylfg for something that should have been included in-game in the first place (based on the feedback received in both alpha and beta)?

Maybe these seem a bit snarky, but they really killed my enjoyment of this game and I'd genuinely like to know if they've been addressed. 




 Another newbie question - right now I am using my wife's electric piano's built in metronome, but it bottoms out at 40bpm. My snark has a visual metronome, but again it bottoms out at 40bpm. In fact, most of the metronomes I've found seem to bottom out at 40bpm.

For some of the pieces I am having a lot of trouble with, 40bpm is simply still too fast.

So, does anyone have a metronome that goes slower that they'd mind sharing? 




 Hey everyone. I've been taking lessons for about 2-3 months now, and I feel like I've made real progress. We're following the Christopher Parkening method book, and it seems to be moving at a decent pace (though I will admit when you start getting to pieces like Melancholia I just can't seem to play fast enough for the piece to sound decent, and my hands still don't move around the fretboard and strings fast enough to play the fugue decently).

Anyway, I am still noticing that if I skip back to the first few exercises of the book, I occasionally hit the wrong string or play the wrong note. I feel like I should have those earlier pieces mastered.

Is it just beginner clumsiness? Or should I go back and try to completely master those pieces so they can be played perfectly every time? Is mastery really knowing the piece, or perfect flawless execution? What should I be aiming for as a student - especially on pieces that I've been playing awhile?
 




 Hey everyone. This is hopefully a simple question.

I paid off my car this year, but have continued to "pay my bill" into a savings account. At this point it's about 1500$. The goal is to eventually use thay as a down payment for a new car, or to pay off a new car completely for either my wife or myself.

The savings account earns .75%, not great, not horrible. I'm considering taking that money and putting it into a well diversified portfolio of funds instead.

Is this a good idea? I figure if one of our cars dies, my wife and I have an emergency fund and the ability (even if it sucks) to drive one another to work (i even have the option to telecommute). That contingency should cover us for the time it takes to sell however many shares necessary. My wife's car has about 70k miles on it, mine has about 101000 and we both plan to drive them until they cant be realistically maintained anymore.

Any feedback would be appreciated. 









 So, interesting question I hope. Does anyone know of any funds which collect companies directly related to the growing/sale of marijuana?

For instance, lots of folks have heard of Medbox and the massive boom they encountered. I can only imagine as more states move towards medicinal marijuana, decriminalization, and full legalization we will see many more business opportunities.

In that same vein - are there any "vice" funds? Funds comprised of companies that cater to mankind's baser urges - condoms, casinos, alcohol, tobacco, etc? 




 Basically what the title says.

We keep our mortgage money in its own separate account from everything else, and it gets funded from our checking account automatically ever pay period. Thanks to 3 pay months, the account that account has 2 mortgage payments worth of cash in it in addition to the amount that we're paying on the 1st of november (assuming something bad would happen, we would cancel the extra we are paying and just pay the minimums).

I want to keep 1 months payment on hand at all times just in case something weird ever happens with paychecks or whatever.

However, we're a few thousand away from paying off PMI (home cost 194k, we are at around 159k on principal now, pmi should go away at around 151k/78%). We are already paying about 860 towards principal (150 base plus 710 extra), but if we sacrifice that extra month's security we could get PMI to go away even faster - about 2-3 payments faster (a savings of 160-240 or so dollars).

So, what is everyone's thoughts? Sacrifice the security for 2-3 months less of PMI? Or just play it safe? 




 Hey everyone!
When I added my card to circle, it stated that I may get hit with a cash advance fee for using their service.

My cash advance rate on my credit card is astronomical, and I'd really like to avoid that. Is there any easy way to tell if I'll get hit with it or not? 




 Hey everyone, we are entering fall now in my zone (USDA 6), but I recently received some 5000 seeds for Spilanthes Oleracea (toothache plant) that I really want to begin growing. I know nothing about grow lights.

I'd like to avoid HPS/MV/MH due to fire risk and cost of equipment.

So, can I use CFLs/LEDs for growing these guys? Do I *need* HPS/MV/MH bulbs?

How do I go about figuring out the ratios of time for lights on/lights off? Sadly when I start googling about it, I find lots of information about growing pot, but not much about growing other plants. For a flower like this, I would assume I would start with 24/7 light over the seeds while they germinate, and then some other ratio once they are ready to flower??

Any help would be appreciated, I've never done any indoor growing like this. 




 Hey everyone. I am trying to find a service that offers a similar service to what sharebuilder used to offer. They used to provide a membership option where you'd pay N dollars a month and get up to X AUTOMATIC trades a month as part of the package. It gave you an excellent discount for folks who wanted automated dollar cost averaging.

However, the plan isnt offered on their website anymore, and I spoke with their support and it has been removed. The new price structure is significantly more expensive (a flat $3.95 per trade). 

So, is there any other brokerage that operates the way sharebuilder used to? 




 Hey everyone. I received a $25 iphone gift card a few days ago. I more or less never use the itunes store, so it doesn't do much for me. BTC however does. Is there any safe market for me to sell the itunes code? 




 This email was received this morning:
 Dear Clients
 
 Regrettably I have to announce the failure and closure of Bitcoin Trader.
 
 While preparing for the final audit results, a task we were working on for weeks now, our bitcoin wallet has been hacked and emptied, just after exchanging our fiat holdings within the exchanges to bitcoin and transferring our entire holdings to our wallet, in order to proof our solvency.
 
 It is a known fact that I personally opposed any proof of solvency, but agreed to conduct it for the sake of a few dozen small and medium investors.
 
 The hacker contacted me shortly after he took advantage of our holdings and demanded a ransom in order to transfer the coins back. I have agreed to a 25% ransom of the entire sum, but havent heard back from him for several days now.
 
 My aim was to create something based on trust, just as bitcoin itself is based on distributed trust. Unfortunately I must admit today, I have failed. All left to do now is to declare bankruptcy with the Panamanian authorities and to hand over all relevant files and information for further investigation.
 
 Sincerely,
 John Carley

This same John Carley whose staff has been claiming that he was "lost at sea" for close to a week now.

Let this be a lesson - trust no one. Anyone who says to "trust the earnings" has never been burnt, or is lying to you.  




 Hey everyone.
I am reading through the gift card rules for ebay, and it's kind of dismaying. I was hoping to start selling gift card codes (I'm a reseller with several vendors) via ebay, but it appears you need to have a physical card in hand, can't have more than 1 card selling at a time, etc.

However, does anyone know if I can sell a gift card VOUCHER? Essentially I would purchase the gift card voucher on my end, and when the customer purchases the gift card voucher, I would mail a print out of the voucher to them with tracking information.

Is this a violation of the rules? For the life of me I can't seem to get feedback from ebay about this. 




 Hey folks.
I am trying to start getting my tax info ready for 2014 for mining.

I had done a bit of mining using multipool, so I have a large number of transactions for small coins; stuff like TIPS, DGC, etc.

How can I figure out the value of those coins on the day they were mined? For many, there is no direct USD price history.

For instance, I looked at the chart at the bottom of this link:
http://myip.ms/view/market_coins/147/TIPS_LTC.html

An example - on feb 5th 2014, it says that at that time, 1 TIPS sold for an average of 0.00000051 LTC. Does that mean the value of LTC at the time? Or does it mean the value of LTC now?

At the time 1 LTC was 21.149991995 dollars USD:
http://www.cryptocoincharts.info/pair/ltc/usd/crypto-trade/1-year

So is the math:
21.149991995 * 0.00000051 * N where N is the number of TIPS?

Or do I need to use the current value of LTC in USD?

Any advice would be appreciated.

I'm trying to make my taxes honest this year as my mining operation starts getting larger and larger. 




 Hey everyone. I am looking to start purchasing larger quantities of gift cards with the intention of reselling. My big issue right now is sourcing. Given most of my selling avenues will take a bite out of my margin, I can't seem to find a good source that can absorb the cost of overhead and still leave meat on the bone for me.

Amazon offers an API to generate codes, but there is a minimum of $50,000 a year, which is going to be darn near impossible. This means I have to buy varieties of them in orders of $5k or more. Still too much for me to start with :(

When I google for it, I get a TON of seo-optimized zero information websites made to play the googlebot, so I'm unable to find real leads.

How does one get started in this industry? Do you have to start reaching out to the retailers directly? Do they offer APIs to purchase gift cards on the fly? 




 Hey everyone.
Last week, bitcoin-trader.biz issued a statement that the audit that their users had paid for was not going to be released because they felt it was "unsatisfactory." A number of users became very concerned about this, especially considering that the users themselves had paid for the audit to be conducted.

As of this afternoon when payouts were scheduled to begin, BT issued this statement on their facebook page:

Due to technical issues with the key server, which occurred during the processing of cashout requests not all pending bitcoin cashout requests could be processed. We have contacted our sys admin to look into the issue and will resume bitcoin cashout requests as soon as possible. About 200 or so bitcoin requests accumulated during the weekend had been processed, as well as all the other payment systems, Litecoin and Ripple.

BT supposedly deals in USD. A number of users waited until bitcoin bottomed out over the weekend before requesting their payout, locking in the amount of BTC. However, given the increase, some users now are owed BTC that is up to 25% more valuable. So, for instance, if someone requested a cash out of $260 over the weekend when it was valued at .92BTC, that amount of BTC was locked in. Payments aren't processed until monday - and that .92BTC is now valued at $330+ USD, but BT owes the locked in amount of BTC.

If several hundred users did this, it could spell major financial trouble for the site. 




 Wheeeeeee!

Who else is enjoying the firesale? Who else is picking up tons of cheap bitcoin?

I've got cash set aside and am buying a little every day for the next few weeks until things stablize to let dollar cost averaging do its work.

The way I see it, all those underground markets that we try to distance ourselves from? They still use bitcoin. Those companies that started up built entirely around bitcoin? They still use it. It has utility. Utility equates to demand.

There is a limited supply of bitcoin.

Limited supply + some amount of demand = a market price.

So, the market may crash, but bitcoin isn't going anywhere. I'm just hanging on and enjoying the chance to lower my cost basis. 




 Hey everyone! I work for a large, fortune 500 company. I am submitting the idea for us to add bitcoin as a payment option for our customers (no promises, we just have an internal "ideas" portal). However as part of it, I need to have some realistic information.

Right now, the best options for a payment portal would be coinbase, paypal and circle. Bitcoin *would* automatically be converted to fiat. Does anyone have any idea what the fees are for the automatic conversion to fiat? I know credit processing runs anywhere from 2-5% depending on the processor.

Also, does anyone know what percentage of purchases bitcoin payments make up for some of the big names out there (newegg, overstock)?

As a benefit, there's no way for a chargeback to occur, which is a great selling point too.

Any other selling points? I'd like to think that as a vendor, any way we can help a customer to give us their money is a good thing :) 














 Hey everyone. We picked this up for my wife, and she has a good 6-8 hours of playtime in it. The issue is, she was playing under my account. She wanted to transfer it back under her account so I could play as well.

If we attempt to copy the save from my account to hers, it gives an error saying that the save appears to be from another user.

Is there any way to fix this? 









 Hey everyone.
Christmas time is coming, and I'd like to get the wife the matching pearl bracelet to go with the necklace I got her last year. The one downside is, bluenile doesn't seem to accept bitcoin which sucks. I've always been a fan of them because A) their documentation rocks, B) their support rocks, C) they specialize in a lot of simple, elegant designs which my wife loves.

I see lots of gift certs available for zales and other companies, but nothing for bluenile. So, any ideas? 




 Hey everyone!
I'm just curious - what made you focus on classical guitar?

For me, I can point to two things in particular.... these guys:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT9hvyDvKHA

And this piece:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPiatDf3Rxs

More flamenco/nuevo flamenco than classical obviously, but through a lucky combination of lack of knowledge and eagerness to get started I ended up going the classical route to get started. I just have never quite shifted over to flamenco (my hands are still kind of clumsy).

So how about you? What kicked it off for you? 




 Just tried the moon strike 4 times in a row. Each time, got to Phogoth. Each time, had at least 1 person quit after we wiped. Each time, ended up being the last person left. Seriously feeling completely unsuccessful because other people suck.

Seriously, if you join up for a strike, quitting the first time you die is just lame. Stick through it.
 









 This may be long. Sorry.

I am a successful 30yo male engineer. I've lived on my own since I was 16 - my parents and I get along ok so long as we aren't under the same roof. 

I'll come out and say it - I'm smarter than them. Or, at the very least I research my decisions before making them and back them up with said research. I was a straight A student. Racked up tons of community service, was active in a church youth group. I led several student groups. I won congressional good citizenship awards. I was never in trouble. I just asked questions and wanted good answers.

So, when I lived with them, I would point out things that didn't make sense. that maybe a gigantic steak with mashed potatoes, a big helping of cake, and soda wasn't always the best dietary decision for each person. I am the only person in the family without diabetes now. I would point out that if they have to take a 3rd mortgage out on their home, maybe giving 500 dollars to charity isn't the wisest choice. They are almost 70 and still about 80k in debt, whereas I have all of my loans paid off save for a mortgage and one private student loan (in total, less than 2 years salary for me). I'd point out that if their church is pressuring them to fork over mortgage money, maybe it's time for a new church. They'd take me wanting to make myself a healthy soup for dinner instead of having the same calorie-ladened food as them and I'd get screamed at for hours as "unappreciative." By the time I graduated high school I weighed nearly 350 pounds ("you don't get up from this table until you've cleaned that plate!").

I'm doing well, not because of them, but in spite of them. I know this sounds arrogant, and maybe it is. But so far everything we've had it out on when I was a teenager has worked out well.

Back then though, any time I'd point out logical flaws or fallacies, or try to improve things for myself, they took it as me being "ungrateful." So, to "teach me a lesson" they decided to send me to a family friend for some "tough love" for a summer. I never went back home. 

The first week was great. He had been someone I looked up to. He was a decorated retired soldier that I thought would understand that my parents are a bit off kilter and prone to making bad decisions and hyperbole. We talked about it a lot the first week. He actively asked me about the issues I was having at home.

Then one night while I am sleeping, I get slapped. It was him with a steel baseball bat, standing over me. He told me I was his for the summer, and he was going to teach me how good I had it "back home." So began a summer of physical, emotional, and mental abuse. He'd force me to work outside for hours with no sunscreen ("what are you, a little bitch? Man up, you dont need sunscreen.") which led to my shoulders blistering, cracking, bleeding. I still have those physical scars. That put me in the hospital for heat stroke. He beat me several times for whatever perceived slight he could conjure up. He said he had people spying on me, and claimed I destroyed his pool by pouring bleach into it because "one of his spies saw it." (I had had 2 people over that night and we were inside the whole time, so no, it was not me who touched his pool). I got a summer job and begged to stay there for extra hours, but when I got a paycheck he threatened to beat me if I didn't sign it over to him. He refused to feed me, and said I had to pay for my own food. I lost nearly 40 pounds that summer from stress and lack of food. The only things I ate were free food at my workplace (a pretzel place in a walmart that had an "employees can help themselves" policy - i literally lived on pretzel dogs and pretzels for the summer). I begged my parents to take me home but they were the ones who put me there. He busted my nose. My parents kept telling me "it's not that bad. You WANTED a vacation from home, right?"

But the worst was one night after a day of work, I came home and he forced me to sit down next to him on the couch. He turned on a porno. I have no idea if this was genuine or if it was just more mental abuse. He started talking about how when he was in the military he participated in an orgy and it was the most sexually thrilling moment of his life. He hands me some tissues and tells me to jerk off for him. I say no, that I'm uncomfortable. He keeps saying it's ok, if I jerk off he will too, I keep saying no, no, no. He keeps pressuring me. He starts throwing tissues at me and telling me to whip it out. I get up and run out of the house and sprint as fast as I can down the nearby highway. 

Police are called and pick me up, I tell them I want to go home. Police listen to my parents, and take me back to abuser's house "because they want to teach me a lesson and scare me straight." He proceeds to beat the shit out of me, threatens me with the bat that he'll bash my skull in if I ever try that again, etc.

Finally summer ends, and my parents take me back home. I contact my best friend and move out immediately. I leave everything behind. I just want out of my parents house. I sever all ties with the abuser. He severs ties with my family for the most part. I am on poor terms with my family, I see them maybe 1 day a year.

I never talked to them about everything that happened other than the fact that when I needed them, they weren't there for me and refused to help me or believe me. They keep saying it was for my own good.

Fast forward to a year ago. I get a message from the abuser in facebook. I ignore it. I get another, and I ignore it. I get a friend request. I deny it. I get another. I ignore it. Then I get a call from my mom asking me why I won't talk to the abuser.  It turns out that my parents, who are both very sick (mom in a wheelchair, dad in and out of the hospital) have been getting tons of help from the abuser for free. He put a roof on their house. He repaired their sidewalks, etc. They view him as a son. I like that they're getting free things out of the asshole. So long as I don't have to see or hear from him or hear ABOUT him, I'm content.

I tell her to stop trying to force it. I don't want to talk to him. I don't want to see him. My mom keeps trying to set up days for me to come over to the house when he just so happens to be there. I turn around, grab my wife, get in my car, and drive away.

Finally I told the abuser point blank that I have no desire to ever speak to him. To leave me alone. Stay the hell out of my life.

Yesterday my wife had to drop by my parent's house to grab a phone charger for my dad who was rushed to the hospital a few days ago. While there, my mom tells my wife that they my father had asked the abuser to "give me a rough summer to see how good I had it at home." my dad wants to talk to me about it. I don't want to talk about it.

I don't want to destroy the guys life. He had it rough (mom shot herself with a shotgun, dad was an abusive alcoholic and ultimately killed himself). He has kids. He does help my parents. I am content to have no contact with him. My parents just won't drop it. Maybe the jerkoff thing was some fucked up mind game. I'm not broken, I've done very well for myself. I'm paranoid of people and an introvert, but I've always been that way.

It's when he reaches out to me and pushes the issue, then I want blood. I also am concerned about my nephews who live with my parents. What if it wasn't a mind game? Maybe he'll try the same thing with my nephews? Would my parents even believe me if I said something? They have a very strong penchant for denial about bad things in their life.

And now here I am. Asking you all for your advice. I want this person out of my life. He so far has respected my wishes to leave me the hell alone, but he bitches to my parents and they pressure me to talk to him. I just want it to go away.

I just don't know what to do. The only people who know the whole story are my wife, a very close friend who was also the victim of abuse, and now all of you.

It's been showing in my coinbase account for hours now. 0 confirmations. I'm trying to understand what I'm seeing - it looks like scores of addresses each getting a small transaction with btcsmart listed as the source address? Is it basically bitcoin spam? 

Did they get my address somehow? 




 Hey everyone. My wife and I are planning to have a child in the next 18-24 months, but we were thinking we could jump start an educational account now by putting 50-100$ of every paycheck in ahead of time to maximize growth. It's not much, but that 2400-4800$ will grow over 18 years or so.

The account that seems to come up the most often is a 529. When we would create the 529, do we have to name the beneficiary? Since this is a kid that doesn't yet exist, that would be hard for us to do.

Are there any other types of account that would give beneficial tax treatment for this kind of savings?

Also, what are the caveats if said child would ultimately choose not to seek secondary education? Say, if they decided to go entrepreneurial, or if they went to a tech school?

Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you!!

Edit: Found some old threads. I've already maxed out the 401k up to the point where my employer stops matching, and I'm contributing an additional 1% to a roth 401k. My wife is a teacher and should get some kind of pension, in addition she contributes to a 403b. She just got her masters, and will be significantly upping her contribution. 




 Hey everyone. Apologies if this has been asked before, a quick search didn't show me anything.

I've been looking at zenportal all day today, and I keep seeing a pink "progress bar" saying that payouts are in progress. They've been in progress since about 9am EST. Is this normal...? From what I was reading payouts are usually handled by 10am CST? I picked up my first hashlets yesterday and today. 




 Hey everyone. I'm struggling to find reasons to keep playing destiny. As it stands for me, it's lonely and kind of dull. I picked it up for the coop.

I just got my first PS3 about 2 weeks ago. It's the first console I've owned since I had a sega genesis decades ago. Most of my friends have moved on to a newer gen, so playing with them isn't an option. I'm also not a young guy with a ton of friends who are gamers, so my friend list is empty.

I hear folks saying they get tons of invites - after about 20 hours of gameplay, I've gotten a total of 1 and have never interacted with the person. It's also kind of clunky to see someone in a pvp match, hit R3 to select them, then open a menu, send an invite, only to find out that in that time I've been killed and the selection isn't there anymore. So, after awhile I just stopped bothering.

So, I see folks suggesting clans. Well, how does that work exactly? Do I join the clan, and then manually add every single person to the clan to my friend list? Do I have to keep maintaining that? Is there any way to automatically sync it with the game? Do I need to have a PC with teamspeak/rogerwilco nearby?

Seeing folks in game and not being able to really interact with them is just killing this game for me. I'm feeling like I wasted 90$ to socialize with people and am being limited to jumping and dancing, which is really disappointing to me. 




 I havent really been silent about how much I dislike the refusal to allow much, if any, interactivity between players. I know golks try to justify it by saying that everyone ELSE is an annoying 12 year old, or whatever.

I think what really bothers me is the fact that their ads show people talking to one another. They dont show the players dancing or jumping to communicate - theyre talking. Social interaction was advertised. But it isn't there unless you start adding a bunch of random people to your friend list. 




 Hey everyone.
I personally have a sizable stake in a closed end fund. It has incredible results, and has for over a decade. I understand their strategy, their financials are good. By all normal investing standards, they would be a great place to invest.

Yet every time I see them mentioned, there are huge cautions that they are a closed end fund and you should understand closed end funds before getting involved. I DO understand closed end funds, and honestly, I don't quite get the concern about them vs a traditional mutual fund. 

I get that there are a set number of shares in existence and that will not change, and their price is determined by the market value of the fund shares themselves, as opposed to the value of the component stocks behind the fund. But why the constant warnings for additional caution and scrutiny everywhere? It seems like a pretty easy thing to understand, and I can't quite put my finger on the reason for all of the warnings. It doesn't seem any more dangerous than any other investment vehicle.

Any thoughts? 




 Hey everyone. I snagged the list of compromised "gmail accounts" from this site after seeing some of the news stories:
https://forum.btcsec.com/index.php?/topic/9426-gmail-meniai-parol/page-3

Happily, none of my accounts are listed.
Sadly though, my wife's account is.

Is there any way I can find out what password it was that was listed with it? We probably only need 2 or 3 characters to figure it out from there. Luckily she usually uses complicated passwords, and different ones at every site. It may provide a clue as to what site the compromise came from.

I know there had been an online checking tool that would list the first 2-3 characters, but it has since been stripped out of most of the articles I have found.

Any help would really be apppreciated. 




 This is something that has been bothering me since last night. Given the lack of communication abilities, would you notice if 99% of the other players in the game were bots? How do you know they aren't bots?

I'm just thinking of Guild Wars 2, where in the early levels, you'd see the exact same bots "playing" at the same time as you. The same names, the same race as you, often even the same class. The first few playthroughs it gave the illusion of having lots of people playing, however eventually you started to notice the exact same player every single time and the illusion got shattered. They were playing beside you, but it was obvious that it was a trick. 




 Since bungie seems dead set on not letting players communicate, I propose reviving morse code. In game, you can use your gun and simply shoot. 

For example, need help? SOS!
3 shots in rapid succession, 3 shots with long pauses between them, and then finally 3 shots in rapid succession.

OR we could do a single jump for a dot, and a double jump for a dash.

OR we could spam eachother with fireteam invites in rapid succession, but that would require the other player to decline the invites.



OR... well... bungie could just let players talk to each other. But that's just crazy talk. 




 About 2 hours ago I got to sit down and finally play Destiny for a bit. I've had it since this morning, but with work, dinner, helping the wife etc I haven't had a chance to play. These are the scattered thoughts I have about the experience. I'm not a fanboy. I didn't play beta, alpha. I'm also not negative about the game. I do think there are a lot of places this could be brushed up, and Bungie should really know better.

So, let's start with the install. This went super easy. I'm using RCN 50mbps down service, so there's very little that doesn't scream when it comes to downloading. This was no exception. The full download and install took about an hour (the install taking the lion's share of that on my PS3).

Next, I registered my Sparrow code (I preordered the DGE via Gamestop for the uncommon Sparrow). Again, no issues at all. This part, for me, went painlessly. I've seen tons of issues on reddit though, so it looks like a bunch of folks got unlucky, which sucks.

I logged into the bungie site and registered the full list of codes, nothing gave me any problems.

So, game launch! Almost immediately I encountered an error. I've posted about it on here, and over on the bungie forums with no real suggestions. When the brightness setting comes up, it says to make it so the logo to the left is barely visible. The problem is, the logo is never visible. Like, it simply isn't there. When you go into options and bring it up, you see the logo briefly, but then the entire background goes black (Here's a snapshot: http://imgur.com/QZw9WAa) No idea how to fix it. Some folks have suggested my TV, but it's a very high end 51" Samsung plasma that supports every video option from the PS3. Some folks have suggested to change the color settings - no, this has been professionally calibrated. I'm not changing it for one game. No other game has issues. My post on the bungie support site has been ignored. -1 for a bad first impression, even if it doesn't seem to impact gameplay. I went so far as to eventually try a full uninstall and reinstall because my new 95$ toy seems to have been partly broken on arrival. Bungie seems to have no real support on their website either - just a forum where if you ask a difficult question, you basically never get a response. In fact, the vast majority of questions on their help forum have gone unanswered. That's troubling. I get it, it's opening day, they're focused on triage. But seriously, not even a "open a support request" page?

So, that aside, I went ahead and created a character, specifically a human male titan. One of the things I kept hearing about this was how in depth the character creation was. I was actually kind of disappointed here - it was nowhere near as limitless as it was hyped to be. Choose your race, your gender, your skin color, your lip color, your eye color, your hairstyle and color, and if you want any facial markings or scars. But if you're human, you can't get cool markings. If you're one of the awoken, you don't get to have scars. It seems artificially limiting - especially when folks have been talking up how deep it went. I was expecting Skyrim type customization where you can control everything down to facial geometry. Still, i was able to put together a fairly dude-ly toon and I kicked it off.

The opening video has some interesting stylistic choices. There's lots of screen jumping and color palette flickering that goes on, to the point where I actually thought it was a bug or problem with the video file (you can see what I mean here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN9nWByWQD4). Or, I thought it was going to suddenly pull back and turn out to be a monitor someone else was watching. Having watched it 2-3 times now, I get that there are little text blurbs saying "video feed," so it's supposed to look grainy and jumpy. But the first time through, it still felt like the style didn't jive with what they wanted. Still, it got the point across. There's a big snowball floating over mars that makes it rain.

The opening cutscene was flipping gorgeous even on the PS3. I can only imagine on current gen systems. The HDR effects are wicked. Suddenly I'm whisked into existence, and the game starts. I get told to run by a little floating snowball-eye-beholder-dude because some robot lizard men are apparently after me. Except, they're not. I just stand there and they never come. The snowball-eye-beholder-dude starts yelling at me that i'll die, so I stand there to spite him and prove him wrong. I don't die. I get that it's supposed to get me inside, but wouldn't it have been better to have something actually chasing me? Something to make me have a reason to use the sprint button it's telling me about?

So, I played through the first level, the tower, and then the second level from that point on. It played like a normal console FPS. Except I see people around me. But I can't really do anything with them. I can kind of jump towards them a bit? I can't say hey. I can't say "hey dudebro, let's go kick this big mechasaurus dude's ass." I can't say "I need some help, got a sec." I can't say "hey fuckface, I was killing that mechasaurus, beat it." Other people are just NPCs, except you can't interact with them like you can the NPCs (which isn't asking a lot - I'll get to that later).

Everything is super pretty. So much so, that I kind of wish they'd fleshed out other portions of the game a bit more instead of being so graphics focused. I came from the Zork generation, so anything more than text on a screen is decent by my standards.

The voice acting seems kind of meh at this point. For all of the production value, I would have expected something better than what I'm hearing so far. Maybe I'm still dealing with generic low level characters, but still, nothing. What bothers me more is that there's no real dialog with the NPCs. They have one tagline they mention when you approach them, and then when you leave. What should be dialog is instead just a series of menus with a quip at either end. There's no discussing the impending doom of everyone, there's no talking about how good it is to be alive. Hell, I can't even ask the little floating snowball-eye-beholder-dude why the hell he raised me from the dead. It seems like they created a world ripe for interactivity, in which there is basically no interactivity at all. Hell, so far as I've found, I can't even sell crap I don't need to vendors. I guess that would be just too darn interactive! Instead I have to dismantle items instead, so yet again, a chance to interact with SOMETHING is dropped.

At the end of the second mission, some dude in a mask comes out and tells me about the doom facing us all, and I was excited - finally a chance to ask questions! But nope, dropped back in the tower.

So, I switch my gear around, only to find that literally every single piece looks the same. To the point where I honestly can't tell whether or not I've switched anything.

At this point, I have to be honest, my feelings are mixed. It feels like a shooting gallery. You go out shooting, you go back to the tower/lobby. Maybe some other people visit the shooting gallery at the same time as you, maybe they don't. You don't have any control over it, and you can't say hi even if you want. You can try to talk to the vendors and people around the shooting gallery, but they're just shills who say "go shoot more in the shooting gallery!"

I'll play through to the end, but thus far I wish I could say I'm more impressed. But I can't. There are so many good things here, but there are so many missed opportunities it hurts. It also feels like the game has no idea what it wants to be.

So, does this ever get more interactive? Does the voice acting improve? I'm guessing the story improves, but am I basically just going to be shown a movie/cutscene, shoot, watch a movie/cutscene, shoot, ad nauseum? Let me know.
 




 When you go to help.bungie.net it gives you the option to search for your issue, or it points you to the support forum. I've had a post on there for several hours now with not a single response. I'd like to at least get some kind of acknowledgement that someone has seen my issue.

Is there any way to actually get real support? 




 Hey everyone. Woke up and installed this AM. I briefly hopped on just to take a look (working today so I won't get to really play until tonight). One of the first screens the game shows you is the brightness setting.

The text goes something like this: "adjust the brightness until you can just barely see the symbol on the left."

The problem is, there's no symbol on the left. The only thing that changes with the brightness is the background behind the dialog area. I've tried every brightness setting - no symbol. So, I went by the background.

Is this a typo or is something weird?



I also noticed that during the opening FMV with the astronauts, there were a bunch of weird color shifts that would occasionally pop up. Once I got into the game everything seemed just fine though.

Not sure if my install is just bonkers or what. 




 Hey everyone. I work for a large telecom company doing research and development work. It's a rock solid job, and for the most part I like the work. But, I just got headhunted by a recruiter for a startup.

This would be a significant wage increase, plus it would shorten my commute from 5 hours a day 3+ times a week to about a half hour daily. No idea about benefits yet. As it stands, I'll be talking to the recruiter tomorrow to find out more, completely noncommittal. I've done some snooping around and I *think* I know who their client is, and if my suspicions are correct, it could turn out to be a pretty cool opportunity.

However, I know my current employer tends to make counteroffers when one of their R D guys splits ways. So, how does that usually happen? Do I go through the interview process at the new place and then tell my manager "oh yeah, btw I'm leaving, make me a counteroffer now if you want?" with a resignation letter?

Do you tell the manager that a recruiter contacted you ahead of time, but act noncommittal?

I'm just trying to figure this out because I've never left such a good job before at such a stable company.

 









 Hey everyone. 

I've been looking at the possibility of picking up an adapter to attach a keyboard/mouse to my ps3 because there are a FEW FPS's I'd like to play. I've always been a PC gamer, and one of the biggest problems is that FPS's feel so clunky to me on a controller. I feel like I can't aim. The analog acceleration throws things off. As someone who has literally played FPS's for more than 20 years, it's hard to feel comfortable.

I was looking at the eagle eye adapter, but what I'm reading basically says that it just translates mouse movement into analog stick movement, so it doesn't really get me closer to my goal of having a natural feeling mouse.

Now, most of the reviews I'm finding are from 4+ years ago. So, has this ever changed? Is there a mouse/keyboard driver available for PS3? Maybe they've added the bluetooth keyboard/mouse profiles to the OS's bluetooth stack?

I don't have high hopes, but I'd love to find out. 




 Hey everyone.
I am kind of torn - I've decided to pre-order, but I'm not sure about what edition to get. I'm leaning towards getting the digital guardian edition code from gamestop so not only do I get all of the guardian edition bonuses, but I also get the sparrow upgrade.

However, what has me torn is the fact that I'm not sure how much I like the idea of a download vs a physical disk. With a physical disk, if I end up not liking it I can always take it back to the store, right? With the digital edition, I'm more or less stuck with it. No refunds, no store credit.

I'll be getting this for a PS3, so if I DO end up liking it, if I've bought the physical copy I can take it to the store, get trade in credit, and use that to buy the PS4 version, right?

Or is this going to be like MMOs, where even a physical copy only matters for the first buyer - you can't resell them because they're bound to a license key that is non-transferrable?

Anyone have any ideas?

Do you think the extra bonuses from the digital guardian edition (the ship, the new version of ghost, and the upgraded sparrow) are worth the lack of flexibility? Just interested to get some feedback from people. 














 So, I just got a PS3 this morning (well, actually yesterday, but it took 4 preowned PS3's from gamestop before I got one that worked properly). I picked up a 50$ PSN gift card too, with the intention of taking advantage of the Sly Cooper and God of War collection flash sales this weekend.

Well, thanks to douchey mcdouchebag, I can't get into my PSN account to buy them. 

When stuff like this happens, do the flash sales get extended to make up for the lost time? Or am I more or less boned? 









 Hey everyone!
The title pretty much says it all. I am trying to find somewhere to buy PSN/PS gold gift cards with bitcoin. Every place I find with google has a big SOLD OUT sign over all of their offerings. Any ideas would be super helpful, thanks! 




 Hey everyone, I need help. 2 years ago I picked up a pair of galaxy s3's for my wife and I. She had had an old nokia POS that she never bothered to answer because she always had it on silent. It was an endless source of frustration.

As part of getting the new phones (doubling our monthly plan's cost), I made her promise to keep the sound on on her phone. In my view, we usually call each other when we need something ASAP, so the phone is like an emergency device. Her reason is she doesnt like to have a ringer in public places or at work, and she cant hear or feel vibrate, so it can take hours of calling over and over to get through for her. Not very good when it's an emergency, right?

This morning it took close to 2 hours to get in touch with her, during an emergency where I was stranded on the side of the road. It ended up leading to a loss of money, and a huge argument. I want this resolved.
So, is there any way, or any app that will automatically raise the volume/enable the ringer for a particular set of callers? That way she can keep her phone silent as she likes, but she can still have a ringer go off when I or her family call her.

I've heard folks say locale can do it, but they have no demo and I haven't gotten a response from emailing them. The app is 10$, so it's a steep jump to have it not turn out to do what we need.

Another suggestion I got was WhoIsIt, but that only seems to let me assign different ringtones to people. It doesn't enable sound when the phone is set to silent/vibrate.

Any advice would be really appreciated. 









 Luckily I am working from home today, and my wife has off from work. She went out to the garden and found the most adorable little girl poking around.

We've brought her inside, given her something to eat, and are now going through the motions of trying to get her checked for a microchip and calling the police. Does anyone know of a decent sub to post info on found dogs? The only one I could find was /r/lostdog which has a total of 1 post on it, so that didn't seem too helpful.

Does anyone have any idea of the breed? I'm not too good with small dogs. Here are two photos:

She weighs about 10 lbs.

Super timely - the wife just got back from the vet, she was microchipped, and we've gotten in touch with the owners. Thank you guys!!

I'd really appreciate some feedback here. How many of you agree with this opinion?

"Don't challenge an officer" - so, how can I ask if I'm being detained? Isn't THAT challenging an officer? What about asking to see a badge number? Isn't THAT challenging an officer? So, what rights do we really have? Saying I don't consent to any searches, isn't THAT challenging an officer? So, using ANY of our constitutional rights requires us risking being attacked?

The officer states that if the officer you are dealing with is violating your civil rights, we're supposed to file a complaint later on. But let's see what happens when people try to do that:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8v7lF5ttlQ

Are police officers aware of how this looks to the public? Do what we say, or we will hurt/kill you, and if you try to complain, we'll hurt/kill you then? I'm just incredulous by this attitude. 




 I am trying to gauge interest. Do you like coffee? Would you buy doge coffee? How much would you buy a month of coffee beans (1 12oz bag? 2 12oz bags? 4? 8? 12? 100??)

I am working to start a small artisinal coffee roasting business. Beans will all be of the highest quality, single origin, and roasted to order. We will grind them if requested.

I've got some administrative things that need to be handled, some equipment to buy, and we also have to find a certified kitchen that doesn't charge ridiculous amounts of cash and doesn't mind getting flooded with smoke, so this won't happen immediately. But I'd love to help support the community! 




 Hey everyone. First, this post is largely copied from the same post over in /r/smallbusiness. I hope that's ok - I couldn't find anything in the rules that discouraged duplicates and because there's no links allowed, I couldn't crosspost. Mods, if that's a problem let me know and I'll delete this (or at least retype it, haha). I have added some additional details.

I am looking into starting a small artisinal coffee roasting business, operating largely online and locally. I'll be starting small because of the larger startup costs of industrial roasting equipment. I also don't have access to a certified kitchen - we can't get our personal kitchen certified because we have a dog and cat, and I'm hesitant to rent space because I doubt I can make it profitable with the additional overhead, plus, there's another reason below.

From a business perspective I believe I am in a good position to pursue this. I am on the board of directors for a local food cooperative, and as such am networked with several hundred local "foodies" who would love the chance to support a local coffee roasting business. I'm also networked indirectly with several thousand more throughout our state. I've been doing the simplest market research possible - just asking people in the community if they'd purchase coffee, and about how much coffee a month they'd purchase. Results have been positive across the board, which is encouraging.

I can find plenty of information about certified kitchens and regulations on food prep. However, I can't seem to find any information about what applies when you are preparing food outdoors. Roasting creates a lot of smoke, so currently when I roast it is done outside. This is another reason I'd be worried about renting space. If I am just going to roast outside (until I am doing enough volume to warrant an actual work space, industrial equipment, and proper ventilation), why would I want to rent a commercial kitchen?

I know at fairs you see people making and selling food with grills and friers, but nothing is 'up to par' with what you'd see in a certified kitchen. I also see the occasional "pop up" bbq place selling ribs and brisket outside gas stations. So, does outdoor food prep have regulations? Are they different? Are they relaxed? I know in several states the handling and roasting of coffee beans is exempt from requiring a ServSafe food manager.

Not sure if this is the right sub, but if someone could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate any advice. I've written to the state dept of agriculture but haven't gotten any response.

This is in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, USA.

 Seriously - in the past 3 years, I have lost entire crops to vine borers twice. We have an organic garden, and only use neem. We have been wrapping stems of our squash with nylons, and spraying 1-2x a week with neem (more if it rains). This week we lost our yellow squash, our cucumbers, and our zucchini. Somehow the little bastards still get in.

So, since we are at mid august, I am considering planting my pumpkins. We've pulled up all of the dead squash, cucumbers, zucchini, and I plan to plant in the same places. I'll be giving the soil a good soaking with neem, turn it a bit with a cultivator and a hoe. I'm HOPING we are past the time when vine borers hatch since they usually do that near the end of july/early august. The infested plants have been burnt to keep the eggs out of my compost and to make sure the larvae never make it to adulthood.

Is it too foolhardy to plant pumpkins in the same spot? Should I just give up on pumpkins for the year?

I can deal with losing the squash and cucumbers because they produce so well early on in the season. But for some reason I get emotionally devastated when I lose pumpkin crops. It breaks my heart to see hundreds of beautiful pumpkins get reduced to rotting piles of mush over the course of 2-3 days.

I've found a lack of really decent options for dealing with vine borers outside of nematodes, but companion planting radishes can screw them (nematodes) up so I feel like my hands are a little tied.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. 














 ...because there are literally 2-3 wedding "congratulations" cards that are appropriate in any card store we visit. And they all suck.

My wife and I have 2 dear friends who, despite being together for 20 years, have been unable to be married in Pennsylvania. Well, thanks to our courageous attorney general, we finally have marriage equality! Which is awesome, and, our dear friends, as of yesterday, have tied the knot!

So, this brings me to the problem. We stopped in hallmark first, only to discover that half of the cards in the entire wedding section referred to "his and hers" "she and him" "husband and wife" "man and wife" "mr and mrs" or something else based on traditional marriage. Then, the rest of the cards usually had pictures of wedding cakes, with a topper of a man and a woman, or silhouettes of a man and woman, etc. The few that didn't fall in that group were either "to the grooms" or "mr and mr", but they all were meant for brand new couples. The interior messages saying things like, "Congratulations on your new journey!" which would be great, except they've been living together for well over 20 years.

So, on to papyrus.

SAME DAMN THING. Seriously, check out their website:
http://www.papyrusonline.com/greeting-cards/wedding-cards/same-sex-wedding-cards.html

Those are just the explicitly "same sex" cards, but the rest of their wedding cards nearly all have some other sort of problem with them.

We finally found a card wishing them congratulations on their marriage, and telling them to have a fantastic life together. It's simple, sweet, and gets the point across. 

But seriously? That was frustrating! What's worse is that they're pretty popular guys, and I am pretty damn sure that someone else out of their scores of friends is going to get them the same damn card! I mean, they really have like 8 total to choose from.

On the upside, the store clerk in Papyrus came out to us when we told him what we were looking for, and we ended up talking and laughing for about a half hour about the absurdity of the lack of cards for same-sex marriage.

So, someone needs to start a business, pronto. I'm delivering the business idea to you here. Go for it! Make some millions! 




 Hey everyone!
I am currently a product development/R D engineer for a fortune 500 company. I am not formally trained in engineering - I began my college career with a dual major in computer science and psychology, and at all times had to maintain at least 1-2 jobs (at least 1 tech job at all times) because of financial responsibilities. As the comp sci class demands got larger (80+ hours in the lab a week), I couldn't find a way to get the two schedules to work, so I eventually switched to a pure psychology degree because I could maintain my jobs and pay my bills while still maintaining good grades.

My penchant for working in the tech sector the whole time I went to school gave me years of experience, which put me over my peers when it came to job hunt. I found a full time job while I was in my senior year, and after spending 6 years there gathering technical certs, I left, joined the fortune 500 telecom, and here I am 5 years later.

The problem is, I'm starting to hit a point where the lack of formal engineering training is handicapping me. Some of the higher job tiers have education requirements I can't meet, so I can't progress. There are times when some of the decomposition and project management skills I never developed are hamstringing me. I feel like an engineering focused degree would be helpful. 

But then, I have bouts of time where I feel like I can't stand technical work, like I'm burnt out - I've always stuck with it because it comes naturally to me and it pays well - not so much because I want it to be my career. I have looked into starting a small food business, but that would still be years away because I would need to be financially stable and have my student loans paid off first.

So, I am now looking at the possibility of pursuing a master's degree. I'm looking to shift towards management, because I think it complements my psychology degree, and my technical acumen will work well in an engineering environment. But the choice is between an MBA, and a masters of engineering management.

The MBA is the more generalist approach. It works well if I eventually decide to shift out of the technical arena.

The MEM contains a lot of the same information from the MBA, but everything is tinged with a focus on engineering.

So, does anyone have either of these degrees? What information can you provide that may help me decide one vs the other? 




 Hey everyone. I have been unable to find a decent tab for this anywhere. I can find tabs for part 1, tabs for part 2, and tabs for the solo. But no one seems to have the full 3:25 8-track version of the piece which combines all plus the solo. Any advice would really be awesome. Thanks! 




 Hello everyone!
Last year, my wife and I went on our honeymoon to Brugges Belgium, and while we were there we visited their lace museum, and the lace society. We also picked up 2 pieces, both of which were well over 200 years old.

We would like to display them in frames, but I'm unsure of how to mount them. The woman we spoke with said that lace needs to breathe, and sealing it in will destroy it. Given they have lave well over 600 years there, I am prone to believe her.

So, does anyone have any ideas how how to best do this? I was thinking of taking 2 appropriately sized frames, wrapping the backing in black velvet (so it holds the lace in place without lots of needles) and then enclosing it into the frame.

Will this work? Is there anything on black velvet that could damage the lace over time? Will this make it too hard for the lace to "breathe"? 




 In 2013, the SCOTUS affirmed that police who are currently on duty have no legal right to ask a citizen (whether press or civilian) to stop recording or filming them. In fact, it is a clear violation of their first amendment rights.

Here is the actual ruling that was affirmed by the SCOTUS:
http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/garcia_SOI_3-14-13.pdf

So, why do we still see constant reports of people having cameras taken, film taken, people being threatened with arrest for filming, people being told they cannot film, etc? It's blatantly wrong and also illegal. 

I ask for 2 reasons - first, the events in Ferguson. But on a more personal note, last week I was threatened with arrest if I didn't stop filming police who were breaking up a large altercation at a music festival on a public street in my home town. Thankfully when I mentioned the case law and started asking for names, badge numbers, and they realized that I know both of their shift supervisors, they backed down. But why was this even a question? Why do so many officers blatantly ignore the law?

I'm not expecting every officer to be a scholar on constitutional law, but it seems that given the prevalence of recording devices today, this should be common knowledge. 




 Hey everyone!
I am still very new to guitar, so I hope you don't mind me asking this.

I picked up my guitar last week, and am patiently waiting for my teacher's schedule to be set (the best classical guitar teachers in our area also teach in music charter schools and colleges, so at the end of summer they pause scheduling new students until they have their schedules set for the schools and colleges).

In the meantime, I figured I would start attempting to learn some basics, but not go so deep as to get bad habits. I expect to start lessons sometime in september. So, in the meantime I've been practicing free strokes and rest strokes, alternating fingers, and learning the fretboard - all basic stuff that seems fairly hard to screw up. Oh, and I've been growing out my nails.

I am following along with this basic course:

http://www.classicalguitarcorner.com/level-1/

The lessons are brief, but they give me enough information that I can find reinforcing material around youtube to get a solid idea of what I'm supposed to be doing. The first time I've been genuinely confused was this morning when looking at the lesson about the Cmajor scale in first position.

From what I can gather, first position means you are keeping your fret-board hand at the first fret. But then the lesson stipulates playing the Cmajor scale starting with the 5th fret on the third string. However, it looks like there are a bunch of other places where I could start playing it - 5th string 3rd fret, 2nd string first fret, etc.

So, are these ALL the Cmajor scale in first position? Is one more correct than the other? Why are they called "first position" if the root note isn't on the first fret? Is it just a rough descriptor more than anything?  









 Hey everyone! Let me begin by saying I'm not a luthier, and am not even that great of a woodworker. But I think this could be a great way to learn a bit about both.

My wife (a professional music teacher) ended up ruining her christmas surprise last night by buying a manhasset music stand (the same one I was planning on buying her), so I'm now scrambling for new christmas ideas. So, I figured, why not try something a little different?

So, I started looking at the stewmac uke kits.
This is the kit I'm looking at:
http://www.stewmac.com/Materials_and_Supplies/Kits/Ukulele/Soprano_Ukulele_Kit.html

To tweak it a little, I'm going to be getting the grover tuning knobs instead of the normal friction knobs that come with the kit. Also, I'd like to remove the strips around the soundhole, and use some paua abalone purfling. They sell this:
http://www.stewmac.com/Materials_and_Supplies/Inlay_and_Pearl/Purfling/Paua_Abalone_Purfling.html

So, I guess what my question is - can anyone offer advice on skipping the strips that are provided, and instead using the purfling? Will the purfling I linked above work? How can I cut it so that it makes a nice smooth circle around the soundhole? Even some books would be welcome at this point. Since it's a christmas present, I want it to be a little more special than just the off-the-shelf kit. 




 Hey everyone. The wife and I are looking to trade in a good bit of gear for a new PS3 (Last of Us bundle).

Sadly, we missed the gamestop 50% extra promo by just a few days.

I know that in grocery stores promos and sales tend to be on a 6 week rotation. Is the same thing true with gamestop? 









 Hey everyone!
Right now we are looking to trade in our xbox 360 and wii, all of our hardware and games for what will most likely be a PS4. I want to be able to play Last of Us and if it ever happens, all of the older Final Fantasy games from PS1/2. My wife wants to play Kingdom Hearts.

But beyond that, well, I'll be blunt, my wife is a PITA to find games for. She likes RPGs and only RPGs. They have to be active combat without any kind of menu system (so final fantasy games are all out). She tried FFVII and determined that from that point, she didn't enjoy games with passive combat and menu systems. She is obsessed with the Kingdom Hearts games. She tried Fable 3 and while she didn't mind the gameplay, she couldn't get into the story (TBH, I can't fault her, the story doesn't get really decent until it is nearly over).

She gets freaked out by the idea of things jumping out at her, to the point where she wouldn't even play Portal because she had already convinced herself that something was going to "jump out and try to get her." Anything FPS for the most part is out.

She won't try fighting games, and she has no interest in sports/racing.

But yet every night she sits there looking at steam trying to find something to play. She's just too damn fickle to try anything because she's convinced herself she doesn't enjoy it.

I just don't know what to do. Every time I suggest something it seems like there's some reason it doesn't suit her. So, any suggestions for people who like Kingdom Hearts-esque RPGs? 




 Hey everyone.
My wife and I have an Xbox 360 and Wii along with about 20 games we are looking to trade in at Gamestop for a new PS4.

One of the things that I find attractive is the downloadable games that are available. I can't however seem to find a decent listing of all of the titles that are available on PS4. For instance, when I go to the PS website and search for final fantasy, FF:IX shows up with "buy download!" but it doesn't indicate what systems the download will work on. Does it work on everything? Just the PS3? Just the PS4? How do I know?

Their FAQ doesn't contain this info, so it's a bit confusing. Any help or pointers would be helpful, I haven't had a PS since way back when Playstation 2 was the big thing.

The reddit faq here http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/wiki/faq just says that the downloads have to be coded with PS4 in mind, but doesn't contain a listing of the games that this applies to. So, basically I feel a little blind. 




 Hey everyone. I've been on Robin Hood's waitlist for a few weeks now, and I'm noticing that it doesn't really seem to be moving at all. So, what's the deal? Do you guys think this is going to be a legit service or is it vaporware? They have a number of big backers, but you'd think they'd have SOME sort of updates on progress - app updates, news about getting SEC and FinCEN approval, etc. But nothing seems to be going out.

Just interested what ya'll think.

 Hey everyone. I am just trying to find out what a zencontroller looks like. I've recently sold off my old mining rig, and am considering picking up an asic from GAWminers. It includes a zencontroller, but I can't seem to find out much about what the zencontroller is, what it looks like, etc.

Is it essentially a rebranded raspberry pi? Or something similar? Can I connect it to a USB hub and connect multiple miners to it? Should i just get an rpi instead?

I'm asking because if I jump back into this, I need to make SURE that there is an ROI because unlike normal video cards, asics tend to not have much resale value. 




 I was super excited to see this in my messages earlier from /u/dogegiftbot telling me I'd won a giveaway.
But for some reason, the link didn't work... it sent me here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2c300i/winner_train_subject8232_has_won_the_dogegiftbot/

I was super excited either way, so I accepted the prize. I even got a message back saying I'd claimed my prize!

But then a few minutes later I got a message from /u/TheLobstrosity telling me that it was a bug. The really sucky thing is, I'm still seeing threads for other winners showing up, so it kinda feels like a slap in the face. Are they all bug threads? Or was I just unlucky? Poor form to tell someone they won, then send them a message saying they didn't win, only to turn around and have other people win.

I'm not bothering to re-enter. Thanks either way for trying to help the community.

 I know it's bad form to ask for advice on what to buy, so I am going to try and do my best to avoid that.

I am interested in these 3 styles of guitar playing:
-classical
-Spanish
-bluegrass

Essentially anything that contains a lot of finger picking. I love getting lost in the complexity it creates. I'm assuming this would point me towards a nylon string guitar, because that's kind of the standard for classical and Spanish, yes?

My wife is a music teacher, and is apparently aware of a very well regarded classical guitar instructor in our area, so more than likely I will be beginning lessons with him.

So, am I better off finding a guitar at the upper end of my price range that I like and is well reviewed? Am I better going to the first class without a guitar and getting the teacher's advice for a first instrument? Should I ask the teacher to come to the guitar store with me and help me pick out a guitar?

I'm just trying to figure out the correct approach. 




 First, let me begin by saying that I am not a musician. I am, however, a geek. That puts me in a rough spot because I see lots of numbers and knobs and switches and I get all excited. However that doesn't always translate into what will be a good instrument. So, I am hoping someone can help me with making a decision about buying my wife a wind controller.

My wife is a musician. She's a classically trained saxophonist with a masters of music education. She teaches general music and band at our local school district. She has several instruments - 2 saxes, a flute, a clarinet, a trumpet, a keyboard, and so forth. She also teaches lessons privately. If I had to describe it, I'd say she tends to be a teacher first and a musician second most of the time. She doesn't play very much for pleasure, but rather for teaching. Usually when she does play, it's at gigs for municipal bands or she's improving with a student.

A few weeks ago she was watching a music video for a mash-up band she enjoys, and noticed that their horn player was using a wind controller. She got all excited and said she really wanted one! So, I started doing some research for a possible xmas present.

I figure her uses will be: 
1) Putzing around and having fun
2) Playing along with private students in new and fun ways
3) Scoring music for her students - I'm not sure about this one. Are there any apps that will let her plug in via usb/midi cable and let her type in what she wants?

Everything I am reading seems to be pointing towards the AKAI EWI series. I figure the "playing along with students" part throws out the ewi-usb, so i'm trying to pick between the 4000s, and the 5000.

Since she has students who play several different horns, so I figured at the very least the 5000s has fingerings for significantly more instruments than the 4000s.

The wireless on the 5000 is a cool feature and will free her up to work with students and walk around the student. I'm afraid if she circles a kid a few times with a 4000s while she's checking out their form it will just make a tangled mess. I figure I will most likely pick up a mid-range keyboard amp to put in her studio to go with the controller. Is that a good choice?

I can't tell if the move from an analog synth on the 4000s to digital samples on the 5000 is a good thing or a bad thing. I can't see her using a lot of "beeps" and "buzzes" and she'd more likely spend most of her time sticking to traditional instruments.

I've talked to several other music teachers in similar positions and have gotten a wide array of answers from "waste of money" to "she'll love it!" to "well, she could find it useful with the right setup." So, I'm not getting much in the way of help.

So, I guess these are my questions:
-Given the use, is this even worth it for her? I know that's a tough question and probably a bit unfair to ask. I know she can use it with her students, and either one will give her the ability to putz around. Can it be used for scoring music too?

-I've looked around and a lot of folks seem to be pointing to "Sample Modeling Sax Brothers" as a "virtual instrument." I assume this would require her to be connected to her computer. If she were to use a USB cable to connect an EWI to her computer, would that be the only thing she'd need? Or would she have to have an external midi interface box thingies? This is where my ignorance is hitting me.

-Is a keyboard amp the right choice to plug this guy into?

-What are your thoughts on the analog synth of the 4000s vs the digital samples on the 5000?

Sorry for the wave of questions, but I just can't seem to find many good answers - everything expects a good knowledge of MIDI and wind controllers already. 




 Hey everyone. I am trying to find a way to purchase an amazon gift card for my sister-in-law's birthday. The issue is, she is a fairly lowtech person, and things like egifter and gyft both require the person receiving whatever card have either email/sms/smart phones.

So, how can I purchase a gift card in such a way that I can just print out the redemption code, put it in a card, and mail that to her? The way that Amazon usually does it.

Sadly Amazon won't let you use gift cards to buy gift cards, so that is out.
 




 Well, for those who saw my post yesterday, a few months ago I picked up a whole packer-cut brisket weighing in at 18.7 lbs. After splitting the point and the flat and trimming, I had about 5 lbs of fat, 8 lbs of flat, 6 lbs of point that. The point turned out incredible - it got corned and turned into awesome pastrami.

The flat had been sitting in my freezer for the past 2 months until I had time to smoke it. Well, I did that yesterday. It took 17 hours from beginning to end, starting at midnight, ending at 5pm the next day. I stalled for about 14 hours between 150 and 160. I was running into issues with my kettle (using a modified weber kettle with pitIQ, and smokenator) where every time I'd open the dome to add water/charcoal, the meat temp would drop about 15-20 degrees. It was a pretty extreme drop. By the time it would fully recover, it was time to add more water/charcoal.

Finally when there were about 4 hours until guests arrived, I wrapped it, and then the temp started to consistently climb. I brought it to 203 and moved it over to a cooler to rest for an hour before the guests arrived.

It turned out dry. Like, really REALLY dry. The only way to make it edible was to slice super thin, on a bias and against the grain so yoru teeth could get through it. Luckily I threw together our house coca-cola bbq sauce so that added a lot, but this was NOT the moist, succulent brisket I had hoped for. Tonight I'm going to take a page out of the pastrami book and steam it to reheat, and maybe that will add a little moisture back in.

So, I'm wondering where I went wrong. Is it bad to have frozen the meat? Should I have just sucked it up and wrapped it when it first hit 150? Do I need to brine/inject next time, instead of just using a dry rub? Should I have gone higher than 203? I didn't have time at that point to let it go until it was "like butter" but given the dryness I'm not sure there was much collagen at the party.

So, any ideas for how to keep brisket from coming out like cardboard? 




 Hey everyone!
I recently broke down a litecoin mining rig and started parting it out on ebay. I sold off both of the power supplies, however one has not been paid for. It's been 2 days. I sent the buyer and invoice, and I've also sent them a personal message to try and contact them.

If I don't hear back by tomorrow afternoon, I'll be opening up a claim with ebay. If they aren't able to resolve it, what happens? I assume I relist it, but do I get charged for the amount that should have been paid on my ebay statement?

This is the first time I've ever had what appears to be a deadbeat buyer, and I'm kind of confused about what it ends up meaning in the long run. 




 Hey everyone. I currently have an 8lb brisket flat on my weber kettle. I'm using a pitmaster iq110 (drilled manifold), a maverick, and a smokenator. I'm doing low and slow at ~225. My goal temp is 203. The only other mod is a brand new notch in the back right hand corner of the kettle to thread probes through.

Whenever I open the lid to add water/charcoal, not only do I see the dome temp drop (completely expected), but I also see the temp of the meat drop pretty substantially, about 10 degrees (from 160+ to 150 or lower). The problem is, I have to add water/charcoal about once an hour to keep things going. By the time the meat has recovered, I have to open the lid again and the whole process starts over. As it stands, it is 11:30AM now, and the brisket has been in the 150's/160's since around 2AM. I've heard of plateaus, but this is ridiculous.

This is the first time I've run into this issue - I've seen small temp drops with points and shoulders, but nothing this significant.

Any ideas what could be going on? Maybe the probe thermometer from the maverick is too close to the outside of the meat? Shouldn't carry-over keep the meat from dropping that fast? 




 Hey everyone.
I'm located in Pennsylvania.

I am in discussion with our local zoning board and a coworking space about the possibility of starting an artisinal coffee roasting business. As part of this, I'd like to do online sales, including accepting cryptocurrencies.

My biggest concern is the tax implications based on the IRS guidelines that came out a few months ago.

I see lots of resources for helping businesses accept cryptos, but I see relatively sparse information about reporting the taxes involved. For instance, https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_accept_Bitcoin,_for_small_businesses basically just says that they can't offer advice. Are there any good resources to help businesses handle the tax reporting needs of accepting cryptos? For the most part, everything will be getting converted into fiat while things get moving. 




 So, this may be an unpopular view, but here it is.

The NY regulations are a consequence of the IRS decision of how to handle cryptocurreny earlier this year. Most of this community simply said "ignore it!" 

Well, now we will reap what that ignorance has sowed.

Every single thing they have listed is expected of a company that handles securities. When I buy or transfer stock, every single one of these items is required for reporting purposes to the IRS. The same when I do a forex trade on an accreddited exchange. NY is instituting regulations to treat cryptos the same way, and therefore coming into compliance with the IRS regulations by enforcing record keeping. 

In the eyes of the IRS, every time someone opens a business that accepts *coin, they are effectively becoming a small exchange. Paying for a sticker with dogecoin in the eyes of the US government is the same thing as me paying for the sticker with some vested stock. With that comes regulatory requirements because they are trading securities. Every time someone creates a new coin? In the eyes of the IRS and the SEC, they are creating a new security and issuing an IPO. Replace the (insert coin name here) with the word "stock" and everything listed more or less matches what exists currently.

You can complain all you want, but the time to nip this in the bud may have passed. We should have been in an uproar when the IRS decided to treat cryptos as securities, instead the community collectively had the ho-hum response of "ignore it, I'm not a bitmillionaire."

The consumer protection angle will largely be used to sell the legislation to the public. After all, a lot of "bad guys" still use cryptos. Plus MtGox and the other exchange hacks will give them even more fuel.

So next time, try not to tell people they are worrying too much, and actually listen to what they are saying. Because it may bite you on the ass later. 




 I just took a look at dogechain.info, and noticed that we're at block ~302000. Did I just miss the halving?? 





























 Hey everyone. I am looking to drill holes in my weber performer so I can thread in the temp probes of my Maverick thermometer. I know I am aiming for them to be above the cooking grate (obviously). 

However, is there anything I can do to help reinforce the hole? Like, a small conduit or something? 









 I am picking up a full packers cut brisket tomorrow, weighing in at about 15 lbs. I am going to be making my very first pastrami. For the Corning brine, all recipes I find call for:

* 1 gallon/4 liters water
* 1.5 cup/350g salt
* 1 cup/225g sugar
* 42g/8tsp pink salt
* spices

This assumes a 5lb brisket. I am planning a 7 day soak. I will very likely need more brine given the size of the brisket. Can it be safely doubled? Tripled? I am asking largely because of the amount of sodium nitrite in the solution, and it's potential dangers at higher amounts.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitrite puts the LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of the population) at around 71mg/kg. If tripled to 126g, pink salt (containing 6% sodium nitrite) would have 7.56g total. That sounds incredibly high.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

 




 Hey everyone! Simple question I hope - does anyone know if it's against the youtube TOS to put a tipping address in your video descriptions? I'd like to put a dogecoin/bitcoin tip address for folks who enjoy videos. 




 EDIT:
I'm asking about pastrami, not a Texas brisket!

Hey everyone! The wife's dad is going to be coming out next weekend to help us install our new front door. Thanks to her parents' lovely birthday gift to me this year, I was finally able to get the Weber grill I've wanted for years, so this is my chance to show them gratitude AND show them I know how to use it.

I'm going to be making homemade pastrami from scratch (from corning the brisket through bbq) and doing pastrami sandwiches because it's one of her dad's favorites.

So, my next step is figuring out how much time to estimate. I know with pork I usually have to aim at the 2 hour per lb mark because I tend to do low cooking (200-225). I also don't plan to foil wrap. I'm a bit concerned considering I've read the full brisket can be upwards of 18 lbs, but after the last BBQ session I've decided that if I won't sleep for 2 days I've got to make it worth my while, lol.

The corning takes about 5 days, and I'm estimating somewhere around 1-2 days of bbq.

Any advice would be appreciated on helping to refine those numbers.

Also, any recommendations on wood? I have cherry and hickory on hand at the moment. 




 Hey everyone! I've tried asking around on the food sub and haven't gotten anywhere. I'm looking for a recipe for vobla. Most of the recipes say that you use "salt and water" to make a brine, and then you dry the fish but that's all I can find. I don't know how much of a ratio to use so that it doesn't get too salty (or maybe too salty is what I'm going for? Ha!). Any advice would be really appreciated.

Sadly, I can't read Cyrillic so that limits my options, lol. 




 Hey everyone! Years ago I had the chance to spend a large amount of quality time with folks from Moldova. They introduced me to a Slavic custom of eating salted, dried fish while you drink a beer. Traditionally the fish that is used is "vobla." Needless to say, vobla isn't readily available. The closest I can find that matches shape and size in the US is smelt, but vobla has a darker meat compared to the lighter smelt. 

I'd love to make some. Does anyone have any ideas about what fish are readily available in a US market that could be substituted? 









 I've typed and retyped this post about 8 times now, and I still don't have it right, but here it is.

The problem is us. Our community. Right now, we're sick. When doge first came out, everyone was friendly. No idea was stupid. Businesses were launched to do silly things, but they got our coins circulating. There were the occasional scuffle, but for the most part everyone supported everyone else.

But now, when we're driving hundreds of people to our sub daily, you see people taking pot shots at people asking questions "because it's been asked 1000 times before." Oh, that's great, invite someone here, actually get them here, only to tell them when they ask a question to shut up and go away and read. How welcoming.

People post ideas on how to help the community. But then, instead of people actively interacting with them to see what the problem is that they want to address and actually taking note of how to possibly incorporate the good ideas, people attacked them. "You're a scare monger!" "There's nothing wrong!" "Oh, you're concerned because the dogecoin you spent 300$ for after being told over and over that we're **going to the moon** are now only worth 10 less than a month later? I guess you're not a REAL shibe!" "Oh, your online wallet got hacked? Sucks to be you!"

And devs, that includes you. People submit ideas on here constantly, and 99% of you are too busy putzing on IRC to take notice. Instead of people getting positive reinforcement for trying to help things, they get torn down by asshats who just want to shit on everyone else's day. Devs whine that they don't have help testing, or that a feature is *sob* HARD to implement. But instead of doing the logical thing and getting help, there are excuses about how "the source tree is guarded!" "We don't want just ANYONE testing these things!" So, you whine (and yes, it's whining) that you want help, but when people offer help, you say that they're not good enough to help. Well, we're a community and you can't have it both ways. Either everyone is valuable, or not. It's sad how the devs like to say that resources are limited and they're all volunteers, and yet there's not a single "Help us test X!" link to be found to get more help.

People make suggestions, and they get shot down because "OH DEAR GOD IT WOULD REQUIRE A FORK!!! THE HORROR!" Our coin is 6 fucking months old. We are a brand new product. Now is the time to try things and fork and get it to where we think it's perfect. We've executed forks before. The honest truth is it's not that big of a deal. Does it require some effort and coordination? Yes. But we've done it before, and we can easily do it again. It's just easier to hide behind it than to actually get things built. "Oh man, this feature could make us the number 1 coin on earth!" "Oh wait, we'd have to fork. If you think the feature is so great, go buy into that coin instead." "Oh, nevermind. I'll go try that coin then." "GET RICH QUICK FAKER!!!!!" I got tired of seeing this same conversation every single day. Think of this as a product. It can have flaws. That's ok. What's not OK is saying "the course is set, let's not change anything no matter what." You know what happens in the business world when you say that? You stagnate. Then you go out of business. It's pathetic that we have an amazing community, and our devs and a massive part of our community would rather refute almost every suggestion than try to make them into reality.

I'm not posting this to trash anyone. I'm posting it because your trashing each other and your ignoring new ideas and your not paying attention to one another and your NOT UNDERSTANDING EACHOTHER is killing us. Think about what you post. Is it going to bring people together, or is it going to drive them apart? Guess what, if it's going to drive eachother apart, STFU and go play a game or something. I don't care if you have 1 doge or a million. We don't need your negativity. I'd rather take someone who sold all their doge for bitcoin but actively helps people and treats everyone with respect on the trip to the moon than someone who spreads negativity.

With that said, even if you decide to downvote this post, try to stop being dicks to each other. Listen to why people are concerned, and instead of telling them they're dumb, assuage their concerns. If it's not working, then the problem isn't with them, it's with you. Your arguments aren't good enough. It's a chance to improve YOU and YOUR arguments. Maybe they have a valid point. Maybe their idea is really good, and that's the real reason your argument isn't good enough. Accept it, and move on and improve things. If you want our coin to be the coin that's different - do it by being the coin that actually responds to changes instead of arrogantly sailing forward just because you started out going that direction. 




 So, I picked this puppy up for 2$ at a yard sale, and it was almost completely full. Since we're going camping tonight, I decided I'd top it off. For some reason I thought I remembered it saying kerosene only, so that's what I got. Well, it doesn't actually say WHAT it runs on on the lantern, so I figured, what the heck. It's got whatever fuel the old owner ran it on inside, so at worst i'm making a mix.

That said, are there any dangers in running kerosene in a lamp made for coleman fuel? When I get back home, should I drain it and fill with naptha? Just trying to figure this guy out! Any help would be appreciated! 
























 Honestly, there may be some truth to that (I'm NOT a denier). Zyklon B was an industrial agent made to be a cleanser for sterilizing whole rooms (think like a field hospital). There were absolutely gas chambers, but chemical sanitizer was expensive and probably wasn't used to gas people when cheaper alternatives existed. 

From what I've read, several accounts point towards using diesel engine exhaust being used in the chambers. It was cheap and plentiful. Just hook up some engines to exhaust to an enclosed space with little to no ventilation and that's it, carbon monoxide did the work. Plus you could find any low ranking soldier and tell them to hook up a tube. There was no special training needed like there would likely be for a specialized agent like Zyklon B.

This is a horriffic thing to say, but if you are a Nazi officer, you are still trying to fit into a budget. Carbon monoxide from exhaust is far cheaper and more budget friendly than a medical grade cleanser that has to be purchased from IG Farben, especially when you need it to actually sterilize rooms too.

I don't claim to be a holocaust scholar, but it seems like it would make more sense to me. Then again, I don't know if diesel was rationed for the Nazi war effort, in which case that would be a strike against that approach.

Edit: After doing some more reading, it looks like both were used, depending on which camp. 




 That's not really true. People in China and Korea (ESPECIALLY Korea) are very cognisant of it. Though Japan was less likely to do death camps - they usually gassed entire cities (to be fair, gassing an entire city was way cleaner than some of the things we did to them - there's a reason why firebombing is now banned). As far as using prisoners - the Japanese were far bigger on conscripting prisoners and forcing them to fight, or using them for medical research.

We also don't talk about it as much on the US side because most of the Japanese researchers who performed medical/chemical weapons research on living human test subjects were given clemency and jobs working for the US doing chemical weapons research (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731). There was no big showy trial where the dirty laundry was aired like there was with Nuremberg.

We went so far as to then claim that anyone who accused the Japanese of such warcrimes were spreading communist propaganda. So, that's pretty much why no one talks about it in the west.

The only country that tried to perform legal proceedings for Japanese war crimes was Russia. 




 It doesn't. But it is a nice reminder that no matter how many horriffic things there are in the world, some things are still good and pure and wonderful. Like puppies. 




 +1 for the puppy picture.
Honestly, I love that it's the last photo in the set. After all of that darkness and horror and human tragedy, it's a wonderful reminder that there are genuinely wonderful things in this world.

It kinda reminded me of this:
http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/jtbjft/moment-of-zen---a-puppy

Edit: A little context - this was the first episode of the daily show to film after 9/11/01, and the whole country was reeling. So Jon Stewart presented a puppy to show the world that there were still good, wonderful things out there. 




 They did build gas chambers out of diesel engines because exhaust was cheaper than dedicated poison agents. The gas chambers currently at Auschwitz aren't real (they're reconstructions) but that doesn't mean the there weren't other gas chambers there beforehand.

The medical experiments alone prove some of the horrific atrocities committed by the Nazi war machine. Sadly most of the Nazi research was medical or psychological in nature, so we executed most their researchers. Unlike Japan whose research was mostly in torture and chemical warfare - we granted most of their scientists clemency and allowed them to continue doing research for the US (but without human test subjects). Kind of pathetic how that worked out. 




 Cognitive dissonance. You can ask a young-earth believer if they believe in the speed of light. You can ask them if they can see the stars in the sky. You can ask them how a 5000 year old world could see light from a planet a million light years away when technically that light should still be 995000 miles away. They'll attempt to rationalize to justify their position even though they know that their position cannot logically coexist with the scientific facts they already accept. People are able to handle cognitive dissonance incredibly well when beliefs are on the line. Basically, they don't believe it because they don't want to believe it, and it's easier to just ignore the facts or become numb to the cognitive dissonance. 




 I 100% agree. I too have a copy from pirate bay, lol. I think the most "useful" one is the meat book 




 There is a TED talk where they discuss how they made the book. The work that went into it - well... I will eventually buy a physical copy out of respect. Some of those photos took weeks to create. 




 It would be a tie between my Antique copy of Larousse Gastronomique, and a really interesting one called "[In Memory's Kitchen](http://www.amazon.com/In-Memorys-Kitchen-Legacy-Terezin/dp/0742546462)." 

Neither one is a traditional "cookbook". Larousse is an encyclopedia that happens to have a lot of recipes in it, and my edition, 2nd, edition still has all of the cool quips and jokes before the editors advised they be removed. In Memory's Kitchen is... different. It is a compilation of recipes, written from memory, during the holocaust by concentration camp victims.


I love both because the recipes are very often just general guidelines. They aren't like modern recipes where you are walked step-by-step through every detail. Rather, you'll see an ingredient list and then "assemble like a pudding" or "prepare like a cookie." They are difficult, and you often have to do work. In the case of In Memory's Kitchen, a number of the recipes were written by people who were terrified for their lives and on on the brink of starvation, so some of the ingredients make no sense. The difficulty really drives home what the people were going through when you try to recreate the food. 




 Came here for tacos de lengua, leaving happy. Seriously one of the very best dishes you can make with tongue.

The other option is braise it until it is shreddable, but do NOT shred it. Peel it and put it in the fridge for a day to re-solidify. Warm in a steamer until it hits about 190 and then slice as thin as you can and serve on some crusty bread with horseradish and cheese. 




 Go out of your way to do something nice for her and let her know that you don't want to be a deadbeat. Make a nice candlelit dinner. Try to find some free things in the community to do together (free or cheap concerts, go to a museum, go walk around a park). Worry about building memories together and not necessarily spending money on her. Get across the point that you are trying.

Make a conscious effort to improve your financial situation - all the tools you need are available on the tubes for free. /r/personalfinance is a great place to start. The folks there are incredibly helpful. If you think this could go for the long haul, you owe it to the both of you to get over any bad habits you picked up from being in a low income/low NAV family. I'm *not* ragging on your family, I came from a low income family too. Usually not having any money comes from bad habits in conjunction with misfortune - stuff like not having an emergency fund, not budgeting, etc. You can be the one to change that. 




 Did you see the tread watch while you were there? I want to get one but I'm still having a hard time justifying the price. 




 Hello,
I just received further correspondence from the law firm that they need my name, date of birth, my parents names, and an ID number (such as passport). They also provided a copy of the PCC-3 form that they say it will be used for.

I'm working on translating it. My concern is that my passport number in the wrong hands is extremely problematic. Do you know if I can provide an anonymized version?

Sorry to lean on you for this, but I find myself in a rather uncomfortable position. I understand that there can be real consequences of not paying the tax, but I also understand that the ramifications of people opening up international accounts in my name is very very bad.

 The danger in ground beef comes from how it is processed. In most American meat processing plants, ground beef can contain meat from literally thousands of different animals. All it takes is one bad animal to contaminate thousands of packages.

However that doesn't mean you can't do it safely. If you start with a single good cut of meat (or a few good clean cuts of meat) and grind that on site, it is just as safe as eating a steak. The key is processing at a restaurant (or in a home) produces a product that is far less likely to have a contaminant. 

I usually take it as a sign that a restaurant cheaps out on ground beef if theu refuse to make me a rare burger.

If raw or rare ground beef could never be made safely, how would anyone make beef tartare? 




 First, always ALWAYS brine chicken breasts. There's just not enough fat to keep them moist otherwise unless you are perfect, and given salt and water are cheaper than chicken breasts it just makes sense to take the extra step.

Then I usually sear for about 2 minutes on each side and check temp. If I am not at 150 I will ginish in the oven.

You can also heat in the oven to 135 or so and then sear to finish on the stove. 




 His duck episode is legit. When I plan to cook the whole duck at once I usually go his route. 




 Eat this Rock.

I never understood how powerful salt was until watching that. It also started an entire career of canfy making for me by making the salted caramels.

Followed closely by "The Catfish Shall Rise Again". 




 Hm, usually I cook the barley separately with some beef stock.

To get it velvety, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure you cook the beef low and slow. The gelatin and collagen need to melt out of the meat and into the cooking liquid which happens above 190 degrees (f).

After cooking, strain off the cooking liquid and reduce it until it is closer to what you want (French cooks look for it to be napp, which is when it will coat the back of a spoon, and you can draw a line across the back of the spoon with your finger that holds its shape).

You can also add some bloomed unflavored gelatin.

Once you have the broth where you want it add back to the meat and stir in the barley.

For the "not too beefy" flavor, use mostly chicken stock in the stewing liquid (usually ill do 3 cups chicken to one cup beef). Also when browning your veggies, add about a tbsp of tomato paste and about 1 tsp of anchovy paste. Cook for a minute or two until it Is rust colored and fragrant. Then add a little flour and stir and cook for a minute or so. 




 Probably the only one who will say it, but I freaking love pickled herring. 




 Go as big as you can afford. Lodge is awesome, amazingly enough so are the food network and Mario Batali ones.

For your first one I would HIGHLY recommend you get an enameled dutch oven. If you cook acidic foods in a cast iron dutch oven you will not only end up with some really nasty flavors, but you can damage the pot. If you were using it for short fast bursts of cooking it would be less of a deal, but usually you go low and slow in a dutch oven so it becomes a bigger problem. 




 I don't peel unless necessary for presentation. The skin is where a number of vitamins and a large amount of fiber are located so you're really doing a disservice bu removing it.

Just wash thuroughly. 




 Tofu parm.

Buy a brick or two of firm tofu but do NOT freeze it. Slice into 8-16 slices, coat with a mix of breadcrumbs, oregano and parmesean cheese with a tsp of baking soda mixed in. Brown in a skillet with two tbsp oil.

In an appropriately sized cooking dish, pour some tomato sauce (9x13 should work). Lay out the slices of tofu, overlapping if you need. Add the rest of the sauce until coated completely. Top with a generous amount of mozz/italian shredded cheese and some more parmesean. 

Serve with some pasta and a salad. 




 Do both. They aren't mutually exclusive.

Usually I use a rub as a dry brine. Rub the day before and include a good bit of kosher salt (usually for a 5lb butt I use 1-2 tbsp), and whatever spices you'd like.

Before cooking, pat dry with a towel and sear in a ripping hot pan on one or two sides.  You can probably sear about 8 mins a side.

Then add to your dutch oven, add enough cooking liquid until the meat is between half and mostly covered, and bring to a simmer, then put in a low oven (between 275 and 325) for a few hours.

Check with a fork, if it feels tough, put it back in the oven for a half hour.

Braising is basically foolproof. 




 Brine the duck. 

You need to give yourself as much buffer as possible because the breasts and leg/thigh cook to very different temps at rather different rates. Thats why most recipes call for breaking down the duck, it lets you treat the quarters differently.

When you roast whole you lose that flexability, and run into a very real risk of having the breast turn into cardboard by the time the thighs and legs are done.

It CAN be done, but you will definitely benefit from brining to give you some extra buffer for the breasts. 




 There are several things that make food go bad. Bacteria, fungus, and oxygen just to name the big ones.

The first two we can control via sterilization or pasteurization. Cooking essentially falls between the two (leaning a bit towards sterilization). The act of cooking essentially wipes out most of the "bad bugs" in your food. However, it doesn't remove any toxins or waste products that they may have already created. It also doesn't prevent them from coming back.

So cook first, serve later. If you dont think you will use it, cook and then freeze. 




 I have a dream of opening either a late night diner, or a public house. In either case, I know I need to better understand the "little things" about running a kitchen.

How do I plan a menu? How do I budget for supplies? How do I figure out how much to make? How are the different stations organized? How do I delegate work?

Stuff like that - things an amateur wouldn't know but someone who has gone to culinary school or hospitality school WOULD know. There's a marked difference between hosting a group of friends and hosting a ton of folks at a restaurant.

I have never worked in a real restaurant outside of a pretzel making job (and silly me didn't realize the meaning of the fact that it was the happiest I'd ever been at a job). I know these fine points are what usually kill most restaurants, so I want to learn them... somehow. My work schedule blocks me from getting a part time job at a restaurant or attending culinary school, so I am almost entirely self taught.

We have several soup kitchens in our city, and I was thinking - wouldn't this be a great place to cut my teeth and learn a lot of that stuff for free? Would skills learned there be applicable? I know most are on tight budgets, they have full kitchens, but I know many essentially serve from cans. It isn't perfect, but it seems like the experience cooking on a budget for a crowd is really what I would get out of it. Plus, y'know, the good feels.

I'm just looking for feedback from anyone who has commercial kitchen or restaurant experience who may be able to tell me how applicable the experiences would be. 




 Depending on the alloy though. Like, 300 series stainless, it gets exponentially harder to work with every time you do something to it. 




 Hey everyone.
A buddy of mine has what I believe is the metal gear solid legacy collection for PS3. However, every video/unboxing I find has the game in a plastic case. His case is Metal, very similar to the special case that came with Beyond: Two Souls.

For the life of me I haven't been able to find a copy of the legacy collection with the metal case, or any of the other collections for that matter.

Does anyone know what this is?

 Yeah, I do have to concede on that one. The price they get on the bulk buys of chickens is absurd. I can usually get a roaster pretty cheap but not THAT cheap. 




 You can make it better, have a little confidence in your ability to learn. Remember - Julia Child didn't learn how to cook until her late 30's and look what came of her :)

Cooking is just a collection of different techniques you apply, I promise, you are totally capable of doing it. I'm saying this as someone who teaches cooking classes. I have yet to meet someone who is unable to learn unless they've convinced themselves they can't.

 Just now watched the recent [NOVA episode on sinkhole formation](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365411270/), and one of the major items it covered was the formation of the [Bayou Corne Sinkhole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayou_Corne_sinkhole). The sinkhole was caused by injecting water into salt domes, which slowly dissolved, causing a massive sinkhole several football fields wide, and massive leaks of natural gas to escape. Several communities had to be abandoned, still others are in danger.

The process of salt brining involves injecting water into salt mines to dissolve the salt, and then the salty water is pumped out.

It occurred to me that this process is not unlike hydraulic fracturing OR deep injection wells. Both are usually done in limestone rich areas, and limestone, like salt, is water soluble. This seems like it's a ticking timebomb for the surface. Yet hydraulic fracturing and deep injection wells are constantly advertised as safe.

Some of the events preceding massive sinkholes were bubbling up natural gas into local aquifers and surface water. Also, they were paired with earthquakes. I live in a state (Pennsylvania) with hydraulic fracturing, and have personally seen well water that reeks of diesel gas near fracking wells. In addition, the USGS has stated that [hydraulic fracturing is causing earthquakes](http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/man-made-earthquakes/). 

Is there another factor involved here that allows hydraulic fracturing to be safe? Is this just whitewashing a real potential catastrophe? What makes hydraulic fracturing and deep injection wells different from the processes experienced in the Bayou Corne sinkhole? 




 You know ima let you finish but no. 




 Whoever downvoted you is a moran. Paul Harvey was the man. I grew up listening to "The Rest of the Story" every morning/evening on AM radio. 




 I don't think so. Kaufman actually did some really cool things if you were smart/intellectual enough to understand it. Like reading Great Gatsby for an auditorium of people who wanted to watch an hour of him pretending to be a character from Taxi. 




 Just saying, your mom rocks. 




 Excellent - I'll check it out. Hopefully they're registered in the state where they're located... if not I'm guessing Delaware is a safe second guess. 




 USA
Pretty simple question I hope. How can I look up a corporation's charter, and legally required public announcement of formation?

Is there a free way to do it? I am basically trying to find out a listing of the founding board members for a particular corporation.


Edit: Holy cow, thank you all for the great responses! I managed to hunt down the company - they were registered in a neighboring state from where they currently reside. Thank you! 




 This could totally explain why it isn't shown on the w-2s then! I saw some sites (non-IRS) that stated it was only valid for undergrad education though, so it looks like that may be old info. 




 Thank you! Ultimately it would be a difference of a few hundred dollars back on our refund so I'd like to find out how to approach it correctly.

I can see the two reimbursement payments for the school which completely cover the cost of tuition. However if the school considered it part of income, then we should still get credit for it since you're not supposed to include income from your w-2 as part of employer sponsored education assistance. 

But if it's tax free, then we can't take it. 

But then I would think the employer would need to call it out on the W-2, right? It's certainly a head scratcher for me! 




 So, my wife is a music teacher. She finished her masters degree last summer. We are located in Pennsylvania.

As a teacher, she does receive tuition reimbursement from her school. However I have found mixed information about whether or not tuition reimbursement is tax free or if it counts as taxable income. Specifically, it seems to meet all of the criteria EXCEPT it was used for graduate classes, which don't seem to be tax exempt.

The riembursement is not marked off on her W-2.

I would assume that I enter the cost of tuition, and then enter the same value for the riembursement? If it isn't clearly indicated on the W-2, that would imply it was tax free, right? 




 Will rate up for dog pictures!
I'll see if I cant get a pic of my hound up this evening. 




 Well, the guy is the one on trial, not her. So if you can do anything at all to cast doubt on his case, you're not only sowing seeds of doubt in the minds of jurors, but in many cases you can use it as a strategy to appeal down the road OR for getting a smaller sentence.

In this case, you can claim there is doubt that he was the driver. You can say that her purse was on his side of the car. Anything to cast doubt on his guilt. Remember, all it takes is one juror to say not guilty.

In this case, it was pretty much rock solid, but in a lot of cases sowing doubt and blaming other people can provide enough doubt to keep your client free. The prosecutor then has to prove that those people couldn't have done it, and prove that the doubts are unfounded. 




 Heh, no. Nice suits reference though. 




 Anecdote:
When I was still in pre-law, I had an internship at a very successful law firm. I was focused on constitutional law. I wanted to fight "the man" and protect "the little guy." My plan was to work for the ACLU. OR, to go into corporate litigation and go after companies who wrecked the planet and abused people. But an internship at a defense firm was where I started.

A client of ours had gotten shitty drunk, and got into his car with his girlfriend. He drove headfirst into a cement embankment going well over 100mph. He was wearing his seatbelt in the driver seat, and survived. She wasn't - she was thrown through the windshield about 60 feet from the vehicle. She also survived... if you want to call it living. She suffered massive internal injuries, just about every bone in her body busted, crushed spine, etc. She had been a pretty, young, straight A student, huge dreams and potential. 2 years later when this was in trial, she was still in the hospital being put back together.

My mentor handed me the case file and told me to find a way to put this girl in the driver's seat. I saw the crime scene photos. I saw what she looked like beforehand. I realized I would be telling the public "well the truth is THIS WOMAN drove into the embankment! It's all HER fault!" I felt nauseous and realized there was just no way I could do it. I couldn't, ON PUBLIC RECORD, try to victimize someone who had already lost so much for one stupid decision. I read through, couldn't find anything despite some halfhearted looking, and gave the file back to the lead attorney and said there wasn't anything.

I also saw my mentor on multiple occasions literally get up and walk out on people who desperately needed his help because they couldn't afford to retain him for $5k+. Folks begging him for help. Folks who were beat up on at protests. Folks who got caught with a dime bag of weed and were unlucky to be faced with a DA who wanted to make a name. One kid was assaulted with a baseball bat at a rest stop, so he pulled a pocket knife and stabbed the other guy. The DA wanted to charge him with aggravated assault because apparently there was a juvenile record. And my mentor just shrugged his shoulders at desperate crying people who had huge chunks of their lives on the line, and calmly walk out of the room. He just looked at me and said "they almost always come up with the money when they realize you don't owe them help."

I have huge respect for people who can do defense law. But a lot of time there is either a blatant coldness, a certain amount of moral flexibility, or a certain amount of moral dedication to the idea that everyone deserves an ardent defense no matter the cost... maybe some of each... that defense attorneys have. I just didn't have it.

At the end of that internship I dropped out of prelaw. 




 Honestly? I completely disagree. Traditional power companies will try to put them out of business, but companies like Google will fight it tooth and nail because it would be significantly more cost effective to build a small power plant than it would be to pay for the cost of power for a series of datacenters. 




 She started out on classical guitar. I'm pretty sure she knows it already. 




 Hey everyone
A few years ago, I made absolutely KILLER cupcakes. They were chocolate stout cupcakes with a chocolate stout ganache frosting, topped with a raspberry.

There was also a filling that, if I remember correctly, was made with pureed raspberries, lindemans framboise lambic, heavy cream, and some sugar (possibly some other ingredients I can't remember). The resulting product was about the consistency of a pudding. It made a wonderful filling for the cupcakes, and the leftovers made a wonderful standalone dessert on their own.

For the life of me though, I can't find the recipe for it anymore. Can anyone help?

I have found these two:

http://ohmyveggies.com/recipe-chocolate-lambic-cupcakes-with-raspberry-cream-cheese-frosting/

This recipe produces a final product that LOOKS like what I made, but I absolutely didn't use cream cheese. The pictures are good for a reference.

http://www.beercook.com/details.htm?record_id=3d56c9a17e7637d7_97910

This one is CLOSE. I may use the ice cream base without the puree, reduce it a bit beyond nappe, cool, and stir in the puree to loosen it up to a pipeable consistency.

Has anyone made anything like this before that could help? Sadly raspberries are out of season so I won't be able to afford taking more than one shot at it. 




 I saw that... it honestly made me wonder if maybe she was playing rocksmith. Not that there is anything wrong with that - I also started with classical guitar, and I love me some rocksmith. 




 That sounds exactly like where I am! 

I have a classical, a strat, and a little martin... any suggestion on what the best to learn it on would be? The nylon strings are the most forgiving but sometimes it's easier to learn on the steel strings... 




 I honestly felt the same way. Especially when he had both of their weight on that floppy ass diving board. She seems cute enough, it'd be a shame for her to get hurt. 




 If you are doing individual stocks and you aren't an institutional investor, you may want to check out robinhood (not sure if it's public or if they still have a waiting list). No commissions on basic trades. There are some big limitations... you need to be using IOS for starters. And not all stocks are available. But for the majority of my single-company stuff they've worked out extremely well. 




 First, I'd see if you can get mom and dad to find a 1/2 or 3/4 scale guitar. It would be way easier to learn on. Not that it can't be done, but it'll be way easier.

I would stick with teaching music. Songs. Some scales would be fine. Teach her to improv on some pentatonic scales so she can learn to make her own songs. Kids that age are a bundle of learning ability and don't have the hangups adults do. Improv would be choice. Even just one or two notes and build from there.

Theory is simply beyond someone her age right now. There's a lot of abstract concepts that, while they have good justifications behind them, most kids simply won't be able to get (why are there 12 notes? what is a note? what is a semitone? What is the 12th root of 2? Why is A 440hz? What is a hertz? what is an interval?).

Send me a PM reminder and I'll talk to my wife when she wakes up. She's a professional band teacher for elementary students, but most of her kids don't start until about age 10. She may have some ideas. 




 I've tried the following:

* Arching my finger
* Tilting my finger so it's against the corner/side of the finger instead of the bottom
* Holding my guitar like I play classical and letting gravity pull my hand down on to the fretboard
* Just pressing with all of my strength

No matter what I do, i can't get strings 1, 2, and 3 to sound clearly. Usually 4, 5 and 6 sound ok.

I have really short fat fingers, so the area that is causing problems is really fleshy/chubby. Any tips would be really helpful. 




 OP needs to listen to the sing "Common People" by Pulp. It sums it up well.

No, you may not have money, but you'll also never have any idea what it's like to choose between food and rent, or what it's like to live on the street because a boss decided his son needed the job more than you before rent was due. You'll always have a safety net. A lot of people dont have that luxury.

I'm not trying to belittle your situation OP, but it sounds like you have a lot more than you realize. 




 Honestly, I use it for their portfolio builder these days, I can't invest in the individual funds as cheaply as I can invest via SB.

A long while ago when I invested in single stocks their automatic investment was a great deal. Not nearly so much anymore thanks to robinhood. 




 Pretty simple question. At the end of last month, they sent an email that they had an extension until the 12th of March. As of a few days ago, I received a new one saying they had an extension until the 18th.

What is the point of having a deadline for the materials if a brokerage can keep extending ad infinitum?

My account is just a series of funds, so it shouldn't be anything complex. Specifically, this is the message I have been receiving:

 As a result of the reallocation of dividends for certain securities you hold, your official 1099 tax form(s) will be available no later than March 18, an IRS approved extension. For details see the icon to the right. 




 "Quick, congress, I need approval to commission Motorboat 1" 




 Did you give him grief for screwing over Pluto? :) 




 As mentioned, this is a question about US law. This is mostly hypothetical, though it is also concerning a number of leaks about a company I used to have a business relationship with that have come out over the past 2 days. A number of people would like to see the company prosecuted for defrauding tons of investors, and the leaks are extremely damning.

To my knowledge, the constitutional protection against illegal search and seizure protects you from the government illegally searching you. However, another person like a thief or a hacker is certainly not the government. So if they uncover evidence of a crime being performed (suppose they hack into someone's email account), that should be admissible, correct? Because it wasn't a government agent who took it illegally? 




 So, my brother and his wife have consistently had financial issues. They are well over a quarter million dollars in debt, they both work minimum wage jobs. They have two kids that both have medical issues.

A few months ago they ran a gofundme campaign to raise money for their plight - as far as I know they raised several thousand dollars.

I am in significantly better financial shape. I use kickstarter occasionally because I like to help get businesses off the ground, and it's a great way to get fun art and gadgets for around my house. Well, it turns out my sister-in-law is using kickstarter too.

Daily.

Like - almost every day I get a notice that she has contributed to something. But then a few hours later I see posts on facebook from either her or my brother that they're hurting so badly financially that they don't know how they'll make ends meet, etc.

Then I think about all of their friends that they suckered in with their gofundme thing.

I really want to call them out on it. Should I? 




 Hey everyone. I got my LXME earlier this week, and it sounds great. It's meant to be a travel guitar for me, so it isn't super fancy. I picked up a strap as well. I have no problem attaching the strap on the heel. 

The problem comes up when I try to attach the strap to the end pin. It's about 3x the diameter of the pin on the heel because it's also accommodating a 1/4" jack. Working it a bit I was able to get it to fit, but there are still tabs of leather sticking out everywhere and it seems very insecure.

Is there a trick I'm missing? Is this normal? Should I just rig something else to make it work? Can I cut out some more of the leather to make it fit? 




 Hey everyone - hopefully this is a simple question. I am trying to send a letter to a Tax Attorney in Poland. I used the USPS calculator here:
http://postcalc.usps.com/

And it says that the product "international letter" for less than 1 ounce is $1.15.

Can I just attach 3 forever stamps? Or do I need to take it in to a post office to ship? 














 Any help would be appreciated...

 This should be a very simple request. I'm still new and don't have a very good ear yet. It sounds really easy, I just can't quite figure it out. It's just chords.

Here is a youtube vid:

 It seems whenever I post about something like it on this sub, I get rated down but no one is ever willing to offer constructive criticism to help me ask the right people. I'm just trying to find the right place to ask.

For example:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/2wubf1/can_anyone_tell_me_the_chords_in_i_hate_the_man/

No comments, just a rate down.

Is there a sub dedicated to tabbing or figuring out how to play songs? 









 So, I personally find I like playing with my nails vs using alaska piks, fingertips, or other fingerpicks. 

I've never really been one who had to worry about having a manicure kit, so I'm learning how to handle all of the care-and-feeding of having slightly longer nails.

What do you recommend putting in a "nail kit?" I've seen some for sale from companies like Savarez, but it seems like $40-50 is awful pricy for what looks like a few emory boards, some press ons, some sandpaper, some resin, and some silk.

So, for those of you who play with nails, what do you keep on hand to both shape, maintain, and repair your nails?

I've also seen the Mel Bay "Guitarist guide to fingernails" mentioned some places, but I wasn't sure if it's really worthwhile to spend the cash on such a narrowly focused book. 




 Just an esoteric post because it's lunchtime and the smells are overwhelming. 

Currently wafting from our work pantry/kitchen are the fragrances from an amazing assortment of different curries, daals, kadhi and more. No matter where I go in the building, I can't escape that incredible sweet-spicy smell. Every pantry is the same way. It's both divine and torturous at the same time. It's like standing outside a restaurant but not being able to go inside.

Does anyone else work in an office with lots of foreign workers? I can't be the only one who undergoes this torture on a daily basis. I guess I'll just softly weep into my sandwich :'(


TLDR: Indian co-workers are reheating their homemade leftovers, and it makes me want Indian food. 









 So, I know this song is simple. I have been playing for less than a year and have a really hard time playing by ear. There seem to be no tabs or chords available for it.

Would anyone be able to tell me the chords?  I can figure out the strum pattern from there. 

Here is the song:

 I am located in Pennsylvania, USA. A few months ago, on a lark, I saw a small bitcoin point-of-sale that was running an initial offering in a Polish Joint Stock Company. I had some play money, so I invested. Worst case? It's a scam. Best case? I help get a business I believe in get off the ground. The investment was in bitcoin and I had some bitcoin on hand, I figured what the heck.

Well, as of today I received my stock certificate. In addition, I also received a form letter, and  surprising to me, a power of attorney form. 

The body of the form letter:
 Dear Sir, Acting as the Board of Management of InPay S.A. with its seat in Warsaw (register number 0000512707; herinafter referred to as "COMPANY", we would like to kindly thank you for your interest in the activities of the Company. Regarding to the completion of the public offering, subscription and allotment of shares, hereby we state that on 22-10-2014 was concluded a contract of purchase registered shares of the Company, which shall enter into force on the date of receipt the document of shares, on the basis of which you acquired 10 Company's registered shares of A Series with numbers from 64122 to 64131.

 Therefore, please find attached to this letter the document of company's shares which is corresponding to the substance of the contract referred to the above.

 Simultaneously, we would like to inform you of the obligation to pay tax on civil law transactions in respect to the conclusion of the contract, which should be paid to the proper tax office within 14 days from receipt the document of the Company's shares, according to the Act of 9th September 2000 about Tax on Civil Law Transactions (you can find a consolidated text of this act in polish law gazette under the number: Dz.U.2010.101.649). In order to facilitate the fulfillment of the obligation described above, we would like to offer the possibility of preparing and filing the appropriate tax declaration with the payment also of that tax. **For this purpose we submit the attached power of attorney to sign, upon receipt of which we will make the payment of this tax to the proper tax office.** Please send this power of attorney directly to the law firm, which is cooperating with us, on the address which is indicated in the document of power of attorney. Sincerely (president, management board member).



The power of attorney form requests me to:


 "grant power of attorney to a tax advisor (name) to prepare, sign submit, and to represent me before the proper tax office in the issue of submitting the tax return no. PCC-3, in respect of purchase contract of the share/shares of InPay S.A. (polish joint stock company) with its seat in Warsaw (register no. 0000512707), which have been concluded between me and that company."

I've attached images of the 3 documents (including the sealed, watermarked share certificate). http://imgur.com/a/bSLUG

I have 3 concerns -

1. Does this look legitimate? Does it look like a scam? Having foreign nationals have power of attorney to submit taxes for me raised my suspicions a bit.

1. If it is legitimate, the sale completed back in November. If they want me to return it to Poland within 10 days, that's going to be nigh impossible. How much leeway is given? Is it only the postmark date that is important?

1. Did I open a can of worms investing like this? I figured it would be fun, but I have to admit I didn't fully think of all of the consequences of the investment. It's tiny, but still I want to CMA.

Any help would be really appreciated.


Edit: added emphasis 




 Sadly it takes having some extra ingredients on hand and a few hours of work, but one little (well, 6lbs) duck's sacrifice gives me the following:

* 4 meals (2 breasts, 2 leg quarters)
*  1 pint of rendered duck fat (no idea exactly how much, i used about 2/3 cup making roasted root veggies)
* about 3/4 cup of duck liver pat
* 1 quart bag of dog treats (rendered duck skin rinds)
* 1 quart of duck stock

IMO, it's the single most versatile animal for home cooking. The only thing that comes close is a pig, and I can't really buy a whole hog at a time like I can with a duck.

I wonder why they aren't more common in American kitchens? There's pretty much nothing to waste.

Sorry there aren't any pictures - too busy cooking to take any :) 




 So, I am trying to remember what episode this was. 

Basically, I remember a number of quotes along the lines of "Americans have it so good that all they can do to fill their time is complain about everything."

For the life of me I can't remember if it's the episode about smug, the episode about the economy, or something else. I just remember that the point was that people who complain all the time are people whose lives are so good they don't realize it.

Anyone have any ideas? 




 Hey everyone! My teacher and I have been working through the Parkening method book, and recently we added in the Pumping Nylon technique book.

I have been mostly focused on the finger independence exercises.

If I leave my middle finger planted on the third string, at first it was almost impossible for me to put my ring finger on the first string. I had to use my other hand and push the finger down.

After two weeks, it will go down there on its own but the movement to get it down there seems like it is in slow motion, and it almost never sounds clearly. It also makes my hand ache for a good half hour afterwards. If I move it up to the 6 th string, 90% of the time the middle finger comes up with it, even when I am consciously telling my hand not to move my middle finger.

Do some people just have really "stuck together" middle and ring fingers? Will I work through this? Is it a normal part of developing finger independence?

I was expecting the little finger to be way worse, but I don't seem to have any issues with that one. Just the ring finger. 




 A buddy of mine has been attempting to sell and then backing off of selling this guitar for years. In college it was his baby, so he is hesitant to part with it. But he never plays, so it jas been languising in his basement for nearly a decade.

So I asked him if I could long term borrow, and if he ever decided he wanted to sell, I would buy it. That way he could always get it back if he wanted.

Anyways, I got it set up, but he has 3 of the tremolo springs missing, the backplate is missing, and the tremolo bar is missing. I want to replace the missing parts (probably not the springs because I don't want to set it up again and it plays nicely).

I've found a replacement backplate, but I see hundreds of different tremolo bar options.  I tried reaching out to fender but got no response. Can anyone link me to the correct one? 

Feel free to use an amazon aff link if you want to get a few cents off the purchase, its the least I can do.

This is basically the exact guitar (sunburst with gold hardware):

 Hey everyone. I want to make black pudding for an Irish breakfast party we are having sunday. For the life of me, I cannot track down pig blood. None of our butchers carry it (going so far as to claim it's illegal for them to sell). None of the meat processors will work with us.

An Ethnic Chinese market near us sells quarts of frozen cooagulated pig blood. Every black pudding/boudin noir recipe I can find calls for fresh though (going so far as to strain out anything that is coagulated).

Does it matter if it's been coagulated? Is it TRULY necessary?

After researching, [pig blood curd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_blood_curd), the stuff the Chinese market has, is usually just blood that has been left sitting for a few minutes to solidify and then it is frozen. The way to serve it is to cut into cubes and poach. Similarly, black pudding is mixed, cased and poached. So it seems like the processes are not entirely different. 









 Just curious - is this expected? When I launch through steam, it seems like steam has all of my profile info saved. But if I try to click on dlc, it tells me I have to set up "external purchases in steam." However if I exit steam and then launch, uplay works properly.

Is there any way to make it work properly with steam?

 In the exercise, it says that you are looking to snap the second finger on to the string to create the snappy yet even tone. However it also says that as soon as you have applied the second finger you're not supposed to apply extra pressure.

After playing with it, i've found if I completely relax the second finger while leaving it on the string it mutes, creating a nice staccato sound. If I leave it with some pressure the note keeps ringing producing a nice legato sound.

Which is correct for practicing the exercise? It just says not to apply extra pressure, not whether or not you should remove all pressure. 




 Simple question I hope. My bonus came in and I am looking to pick up a little martin LXME for when I am traveling.

Basically everywhere you look the price is the same, and pretty much all of them have free shipping. Are there any vendors that differentiate themselves by including a bunch of extras?

Stuff like extra picks, strings, etc? 




 Hey everyone. We have a 51" Samsung PN51e7000 plasma TV. My wife tends to be the one who uses smarthub, and lately things like netflix and amazon prime video have been freezing up, causing the tv to hard reset itself.

I've tried doing firmware upgrades and downgrades and gotten nowhere.

So, I started looking at the smart upgrade kits that are made available for smarthub. I know the sek1000 can be had for under $100, but I figure if I am doing it I may as well go with the latest and greatest.

For those of you who have used the upgrade kit - how well does it work? Are the problems with freezing apps gone (googling around this doesn't seem to be an uncommon problem)? Do you NEED to use the new remote? Does the new remote replace the old remote entirely, or is it only for smarthub?

Just trying to get a feel for the product and if it's worth it to drop 150+$ 




 Hey everyone.
I am looking to rebalance my portfolio over the next few weeks. I currently have about 1k invested across the following funds, with 50$ being added weekly and an additional 750$ quarterly:

* 7% - EWX (SPDR emerging small cap etf)
* 17% - PID (PowerShares International Dividend Achievers Portfolio)
* 10% - SCHA (Schwab U S Small Cap ETF)
* 17% - SCHM (Schwab US Mid-Cap)
* 4% - VNQ (Vanguard REIT Index Fund)
* 30% - VONV (Vanguard russell 1000)
* 15% - VOOG (Vanguard SP500 Growth index fund)

In addition, I am making the 3k minimum investment into VPAIX (Vanguard long term tax free PA Muni bond fund). I'm a PA resident, so it seems like a no-brainer to add it to my portfolio.

However, once this is added I will have to rebalance out my portfolio - the muni bonds would make up 75% of the portfolio. I want to try to stick to the Ben Graham 50% stock/50% bonds (leaning as far as 75%/25% based on market conditions) suggestions. How much of my portfolio should go into those tax free muni bonds? Should I look at adding another bond fund as well? 




 Hello everyone. I am looking to help diversify my portfolio by investing in VPAIX (a vanguard tax free PA muni bond). I am a resident of PA, so it makes the most sense for me.

In the past week or so as I was assembling the minimum investment, my sharebuilder account now seems to show that the fund is closed to new investors. However my fidelity account gives no such warning.

Is this just a website thing? Is it possible for new investors to be blocked from one brokerage but not another?

Checking on the vanguard website, there doesn't seem to be any indication that the fund is closed but I don't have an account there to really be sure. 




 I know the books were originally released in Polish, then the video games were made. I haven't played them, but the world caught my fancy.

After the games were made, the books were translated by fans and then official translations were released.

So, that said, I began reading the Last Wish 2 days ago. I've been surprised that the book is actually VERY readable. Not a masterwork thus far, but good enough I keep wanting to read more.

I suppose I am so used to video game related books to be... Well... Terrible.

So who else has read them? Your thoughts? Are all of the translations decent? 














 The caps are intentional.
Growing up, I was raised to know there is a difference between hot cocoa, and hot chocolate. Hot cocoa is based on just that - cocoa. Hot chocolate includes both cocoa solids and cocoa butter.

I can find tons of recipes that use just cocoa, but I can't find any for hot chocolate/hot drinking chocolate.

Does anyone have any decent recipes they could share? I haven't been able to find it since I was in belgium, and with the snow I'm going nuts! 









 Pretty simple question. I know they both effectively mean the same thing in practice, but can someone explain what nolo contendere really means to set it apart from guilty?

 I haven't been able to find an answer to this anywhere. Do the little martins use a nitrocellulose, polyurethane, or laquer finish?

I'm looking at purchasing an LXME for traveling, but I can't seem to get an answer about this question. 




 Just curious who out there has purchased one of these guys? How do you like it?

I am considering picking up one of the HPL little martins with my bonus from work in a few weeks for when my wife and I travel. I thought that it might be fun to pick up one with a pickup and connect a tonewoodamp to it for some neat effects while we're camping, but I'm not sure how well the TWA works, or how well it would work on a parlor guitar. 




 Hey everyone.
In june of last year I purchased a kremona f65c. I have been using the stock strings since then, practicing about 1-2 hours a day daily. None of the steel strings have any visual degradation like steel strings would, except you can see marks from the fret wire on them - specifically the steel strings. They still seem to be ok and are keeping tune just fine.

The only issue I seem to be running into is that g# on the 3rd string (first fret) refuses to play clearly. Where everything else on the guitar rings nicely, this makes more of a "thud" sound. I've had people suggest it could be a wolf tone, but when I play g# elsewhere it rings cleanly so that seems unlikely. Other suggestions were it could be the strings, or it could be a problem with the guitar.

So, does it sound like time to change my strings? Could it resolve my g# issue? How do i know what strings the guitar shipped with? When I bought the guitar the guitar shop gave me a pack of d'addario pro arte normal tension strings, but I'm concerned using them if the tension/weight is wrong because I don't want to damage the guitar (I know that changing string weight can cause other guitars to need to be re-setup because of tension on the neck changing the action, but a setup is less of an option on a classical with no truss rod). 

Do classical strings age faster or slower than steel strings? Am I due for a change? 




 Hey everone. First, an apology. I am a newbie when it comes to tea, and I am posting this using a mobile app so I cannot see the sidebar. I hope discussion of specific brands isn't prohibited (since I already seem to have gotten a rate down). 

A year ago a coworker gave me a box of tea - he called it "red tea". After some help on /r/translation I have found it is   (xin xiang brand tai guan yin tea).  It's a type of oolong tea.

I have fallen in love with this tea. After some research I've learned that the traditional varities count themselves among some of the most expensive tea on earth, and usually it comes in single serving packets. 

I would like to purchase more, specifically the Muzha variety (he described it as red tea, so that would make the most sense right?). I have had no luck finding the same brand.

However for the life of me I can't find much more information. I can't really go to a store and buy more, so I was hoping there are notable trustworthy brands.

Any advice for a relative tea newbie who wants to track down more of this awesome tea?? Preferably in relative bulk?

Really any help would be appreciated. 




 Can anyone tell me what brand of tea this is? It was a gift from a Chinese coworker and I'd like to buy more because it is quite good.

Hopefully this image is clear enough:

 Hello everyone. My wife and I are planning our vacation this year - a little 2 week roadtrip through the Finger Lakes in NY for wine tours, and then the Canadian side of Niagara falls for 3 days, and then south to Falling Water (the famous Frank Lloyd Wright home) southwest of Pittsburgh.

Currently we are planning to travel from our home to the Finger Lakes first, and while in wine country of course purchase a healthy amount of wine for our personal enjoyment.

My concern is about crossing the border into Canada with a case or two of wine, and then back into the US. I know that it really comes down to the border agent whether or not they want to hassle you about "personal use" amounts.

Since it would have been purchased in the US, do I have to declare it when entering Canada? Do I have to declare it when coming back into the US (we obviously will keep receipts)?

I'm just trying to figure out if we need to reverse the order of places we are planning to visit so the Finger Lakes is on the last leg, but we had really hoped to enjoy sitting on our hotel room's balcony, watching the falls, and drinking some wine.

Any thoughts would be very much appreciated. 




 So, for christmas my wife purchased a stationary trainer for my bike. I have been using it periodically since. When I set it up, i replaced my brooks saddle with the stock saddle for the bike, thinking the more race-oriented saddle would be a good way to go.

However, after about 30-35 minutes on the trainer, my groin/penis goes numb. Not "my foot is asleep" numb, but completely dead to sensation. Sensation comes back after about 5 minutes of being off the trainer and everything is ok.

I am, I think quite reasonably, concerned about this. I have heard about poor fitting saddles putting pressure on nerves to the side of the groin, but never anything that would directly impact the genitals.

Does this signify I need a new saddle? Do i need to adjust the saddle? This is the first time this has happened to me so I'm kind of at a loss. 




 Hello everyone. I am trying to verify the authenticity of what I think could be the first copy of a first edition of a book from a rather famous artist (Ralph Steadman). The book is little.com. 

While in Paris on our honeymoon, my wife and I stopped by Shakespeare and Co. The store is split into the main store, and a rare and antique books section next to it. Being an antique book lover, I stopped in.

There I beheld this guy. A signed first edition copy of little.com by Ralph Steadman, one of my favorite artists. Further, it seemed to match up with the books own claim to being part of a limited edition run of 300 books. Even more, it claimed to be number 1 out of those 300. Considering the price of 40 EUR, I thought it was too good of a chance to pass up and picked it up.

The imgur album shows off the book, but it also shows the part that has me concerned about the authenticity of the book.

The copyright mentions the limited edition run of 300. On the title page, the authors autograph is prominently displayed. At the top of the page in different writing is 1/300 (though it could be printed vs script). That would indicate that this is the very first book out of those 300 special editions. But its also what has me concerned. The only other example I have been able to find is this:
http://www.stellabooks.com/stockimages_sorted/384/384394~2.JPG

The numbering is completely different. While mine is in what appears to be pencil, the other example seems to be written in the same ink as the authors signature. Now, obviously Mr. Steadman could have started it out one way, and then switched over.

The copyright also mentions that the limited edition and the normal edition have 2 different ISBNs, but I don't know if the different ISBN is just the same book in alternative packaging.

Mr. Steadman is based in Wales, so it doesnt seem farfetched that a copy in that limited edition would find itself in Paris. Further, it seems doubtful that a book store as acclaimed as Shakespeare and Company would sell a forgery given a substantial portion of their business is selling antique and rare books.

I tried reaching out to Ralph Steadman over twitter but only got a confirmation that there was a limited edition run of 300 - not really a verification.

So - what is everyones thoughts? Could this really be the first, first edition of this book?

I tried posting before but automod removed it because it was a link to an imgur album, so I am reposting with a bit more info.

The imgur album is here:

 Hey everyone. This is something I am pondering. The wife and I are going to be doing our vacation in Niagara falls this year. We will be staying on the Canadian side, and spending a day in Canada and a day in NY.

I am not paying for international roaming, so while in Canada I will most likely just turn my phone off. However, when we are in NY is there any chance of my phone trying to go into international roaming?

When I am on the canadian side, is there any chance my phone will try to connect to NY towers?

I'm not near international borders very often, and when I am it's usually in Europe so I use my work phone. 




 Hey everyone. My wife and I have been looking to begin small-scale production of jellies, jams, and candies to sell publicly. We are in Pennsylvania which has some of the looses cottage food laws in the US, which is a great boon for us. However the department of health still requires that any food prepared in a kitchen be done so in a home that has no pets - we have a dog and a cat, and we aren't just going to kick them to the side. We don't have an in-law suite or a place we could put a separate kitchen/sink, so it seems like our house won't work.

I have investigated renting a shared commercial kitchen, but the prices are simply absurd. We're talking $25-50/hr, a minimum of $250, with a $500 deposit. So at least $250 every single time we would can or prepare candy. After purchasing jars, ingredients, and the time it takes we will barely make a profit (if we make one at all).

So, how did you get started with your food based business? 




 I've been playing since july of last year, so I absolutely still a beginner. With my teacher I have been working through the christopher parkening method books (still on volume 1). We have splashed in some other material (some chord work with folk music). I've been practicing about an hour to 1.5 hours a day. In addition, over the past month and change I have been mussing around with a strat that a friend is letting me long-term-borrow along with an application called rocksmith - usually another hour to another hour and a half a day.

However, I seem to be hitting a pretty heavy wall. My teacher had been assigning 3-4 pieces a week, though that has slowed down. Reading reviews, apparently one of the big criticisms of the Parkening books is that they have a HUGE ramp up in difficulty. 

I am up to about exercise 60 (Beethoven's 5th) and I'm finding that I just can't keep up. Working on that one piece all week, playing extremely slow (15 bpm-30bpm), and I'm only about half way through. My fingers just can't seem to find the right spots on the fretboard and it doesn't seem to be sticking mentally.

It just feels like my progress has seriously slowed down at this point and I'm feeling a little discouraged.

Is this normal - like if I just keep pushing it will pass? Is there a "hump" when you're beginning? Or is this a sign I'm doing too much? 




 I have heard this multiple times, and I honestly don't understand the logic or math.

So can someone explain where this statement comes from? 




 Hey everyone!
I know the echo has no battery backup. My plan is to use it as a replacement for an under-cabinet radio we currently have that is dying. I also think it would make a great kitchen companion. My wife and I cook a lot, so the ability to be in the middle of working and just say "alexa, add fresh cilantro to the shopping list" or "alexa, set a timer for 20 minutes" is fantastic for freeing up our hands when we're busy.

My concern though is if for some crazy reason we lose power. I know when you start a timer, it shows up in the companion app. If you start a timer and the echo loses power, does the timer keep going on the companion app? Or does it stop completely?

Second, my wife and I both have android phones. Does a single echo only work with the companion app on ONE phone, or can she and I both use it?

EDIT:
One more question - can you modify the wake word? I have heard several folks say that it can only be configured as "Amazon" or "Alexa" 




 Super excited. I'm even more excited having played around on youtube and finding some really creative hacks people have come up with to let Echo handle home automation.

I'm especially interested in using it in tandem with Nest thermostats (we don't have any yet, but it could be a deal maker) - something really cool about saying "Alexa todo - turn the temperature to 70 degrees" and having the thermostats all adjust automatically. 




 Hey everyone. Not sure if this is appropriate for here or /r/personalfinance, but I think this may be the most appropriate.

I work for a large telecom that lots of people hate - enough that it was caricatured on a popular sitcom. The company is in the process of trying to purchase one of its larger competitors, and in the event of regulatory approval, the stock could see a significant jump in value. That's all the information I can provide - it should be enough for most of you to figure out who I am talking about.

They offer employees an ESPP which provides shares at a price of 15% off the first or last day of the quarter, whichever was lower. This usually leads to a handsome return. The catch is shares aren't eligible to be sold for 1 year (I know there are tax ramifications with that short of a sale anyways). After 1 year, they're yours to do with as you please.

So, after years at this company I have a decent sized collection of stock, but my concern is that I am so heavily invested. Most of my portfolio is well diversified. But this one particular brokerage account - if the stock nosedives, the account will go with it. 

My speculative side wants to keep the shares that are eligible to be sold with the likelihood that the merger is approved. My safe side wants to sell the eligible shares and buy shares of an index fund to minimize risk. I have 4 quarters worth of shares that I can't touch so if the deal is approved and the stock soars, i will see some benefit. Also if the deal is not approved and the stock dips, I will see some pain when speculators jump ship.

The stock soaring is at least a little unlikely given the efficient market hypothesis, right? Outside of some folks who will jump in when they hear that the deal is approved but I assume that would be temporary.

Just looking to get a feel of what other folks would do in this situation.

My goal is long term growth. 




 I am asking this based on experience with piano. Many pianists have worked through the Czerny's 101 exercises OR Hanon - they're considered essentials.

I know Bach fugues are kind of a big deal, but are there any other exercise compilations that are common? 




 Hey everyone. I am working through my new lesson music, and one of the chords is an inversion of A major. It's played on the 2nd fret, 2nd, 3rd and 4th strings.

Per my teacher, I'm supposed to play using 2/I on 4th string, 3/M on 3rd, 4/A on 2nd.

The problem I am running into is it's a rather small space for 3 fat fingers, so obviously one of my fingers has to be almost entirely across the fret from the fret wire. It feels like I am choosing between having one or more strings buzz when playing, or I am muffling a string, OR I have to press with a death grip. Damn my sausage fingers.

Can anyone offer any advice on how I might be able to play this a little bit more clearly? It seems like it should be simple, but I just can't get it to ring. 




 After having yet another guitar-related post get downvoted within seconds on /r/guitar, I just wanted to throw this out there. Everyone's helpfulness on here is greatly appreciated for beginners like myself.

The folks on this sub all seem to be helpful, willing to listen, and always good for pointers. I genuinely enjoy posting here, and most of the time get great answers to questions I ask. Most people seem to have the same luck. Further, it's really cool that there is a sense of community and that we even have devs poking around.

So, just keep doing what you do. You guys rock. 




 Any suggestions? So far googling around is yielding a lot of "learn the pentatonic and major scale" which isn't really an exercise per se. I can play the scales around the fretboard, I am looking more for exercises on applying them. 




 Pretty simple q I hope. I use sites like amazon mechanical turk and microworkers to pull in a little extra cash. Is there anything like that built entirely around bitcoin? 




 Exactly what the title says!
What are your favorite easy songs that you learned really early in your career? Ones that you're still playing when you pick up your guitar presumably years later??

I'm still new to guitar - I've been taking classical lessons since june, and recently started branching out into jazz and rock on my own (with my teacher giving some guidance to help me learn chord shapes). I'd just love to hear what "easy" songs you never get tired of playing - things that are enjoyable to play - it doesn't necessarily have to be a crowd pleaser or some mainstream tune. Stuff you'd play when you have 10 minutes and are alone in a room with your guitar and no one else is listening. 




 Yesterday I was playing RS and I realized that none of my DLC was showing up. I exited the game and went into steam, and for some reason the game was grayed out as if it was uninstalled. I right clicked to check DLC and it said that both the game and cherub rock were uninstalled. 

I doubleclicked to install - it brought up a dialog that said "checking existing files" which took about 2 minutes, and the game suddenly showed up as installed again, and with it, cherub rock came back, and further all of my CDLC.

So has anyone else had this happen? I've never seen it before. 




 So sometimes I will have issues transitioning between chords for a particular song, and the game recommends playing star chords.

But then when I take the suggestion - none of the chords I need to practice appear in the game. So, while it is helpful, the suggestion doesn't really help with the song.

So, is there any way to specify ONLY specific chirds to show up? 




 Hey everyone.
I have noticed that on my classical everything sounds great EXCEPT the first fret on the 3rd/g string (A flat).

Where pretty much every other note sounds fine and rings clearly, when I play that fret it sounds very dull, as if the string was muted.

Does anyone have any idea what the issue could be? My teacher suggested it could be a node on the string, but are there other possibilities? I doubt it is the fret because first fret rings clearly on every other string.

 Exactly what the subject says. It seems like biologically it would be a disadvantage. The act of tearing the hymen would (at least theoretically) expose the woman to the possibility of infection. Tearing creates an open wound, often created by a foreign body entering the vagina (which should allow external bacteria to get by the normally acidic fluid in the vagina). Obviously this wouldn't be the case for tears that come from any number of other reasons, but still, a lot of females do have it torn via intercourse.

Are hymens found in all species? Is it a vestigial thing? 




 So, in light of the sony hack and subsequent threats of violence (and likely blackmail based on unsavory info gathered in the hack), I am of the opinion that this, along with drones, is going to be the way a lot of modern warfare is going to be heading. We all know (whether we want to admit it or not) that human beings are good at killing one another. That will not stop.

So, what are options for investing here?

I have a long stake in Kratos Systems (control systems for drones). I assume a lot of the more traditional players (general dynamics, raytheon, LM, etc) aren't the best options because they have more  traditional warfare solutions they have to attend to in addition to cyberwarfare projects. What other players are there in these markets? Are there other smaller players who are dedicated entirely towards cyberwarfare or cybersecurity that may be more nimble and inventive than some of the traditional players are capable of being? 









 The title says it all. I am currently long term borrowing a friend's deluxe players strat. He has done some minor work to it, part of which I think includes adding noiseless pickups.

The one thing I have noticed though, the pickups have what looks like metal nubs that stick out of them under the strings. Some of them rise out of the plastic block part of the pickup a few mm. Others are actually sunk down into the plastic block. Still others are about flush.

Is this correct? Should they all be flush? I don't have a pic but I can try posting one when I get home tonight.

The pickups look kinda like this:

 So, I posted a few days ago about rocksmith not detecting a lot of notes. I took advice from folks here and got my guitar a full setup for the new strings I put on it. No matter what, I'm glad I did it because notes south of the 12th fret are actually correct now.

However, rocksmith STILL seems to be intermittently ignoring certain notes. For instance, I can't seem to get 100% on the shifting practice track, as simple as it is. Half the time the 7th and 12th frets aren't detected. I've used my snark to verify that the notes are being played as expected (B and E respectively). There aren't any problems with intonation. Despite using HDMI I seem to have lucked out with having no lag (good TV maybe? or maybe the fact I'm using a HDMI 4 cable?) so that isn't the issue.

My fingers are in the right spot - at least with the 12th fret there are times when the note repeats multiple times with a few counts in between. My fret hand doesn't move, finger is placed directly next to the fret and I get a clear tone, yet only 1-2 out of 3 will actually be detected by the game. I've tried downstrokes, upstrokes, finger picking it, hell I even slapped it a few times out of frustration.

I have my pickup volume cranked for all pickups. On my mac I went into the mixer and cranked up the line in volume for the rocksmith cable to as high as it would go before I started getting a hum.

I've easily put in 50+ attempts now and it always seems like either the 7th or 12th fret has trouble.

So, has anyone encountered an issue like this? Any idea how to fix it?


**UPDATE**:
I seem to have resolved my issue! I made the following changes.

1) I began using the bridge pickup exclusively as opposed to the neck/center pickup on my strat.

2) I went into audio midi settings and verified that the cable was set as 48k audio.

3) In audio midi settings I raised the volume from the default to about 40%

4) In rocksmith, I changed the audio engine settings from the default 4 to 6 (I had previously changed this, but it seems to have reverted back).

5) In rocksmith audio options I increased the realtone cable gain from the default to 4.1

As it stands, I am now nailing every note.

Thank you to everyone who helped! I compiled together a bunch of your suggestions. 




 I am currently working on a seemingly simple piece arranged by my teacher. However, I am still fairly new to guitar. I'm used to chords being arpeggios,  not more traditional strumming/picking with multiple fingers.

What I am finding is that I have a very hard time switching between picking single notes, moving my fret hand and playing hand into place to play the chord, and then moving everything back into place for playing single notes.

Are there any decent exercises anyone can recommend for this that I can drill on? I know it is a fairly simple thing but I seem to be having a really tough time with it. 




 Hey everyone. I've been drooling over some vintage Gretsches in the store (we have a vintage 1964 country gentleman at our local guitar shop). One thing I noticed - it's a hollowbody, but the f-holes are filled.

They referred to it as a "closed hollowbody."

I'm used to archtops that have the f-holes open. So, what is the major difference sound-wise? Does it have less of the noise and feedback issues that a normal hollowbody has? Is it more or less resonant? 
























 The same could be said about the US. Folks simply don't like to admit that they have problems.

 Or the sort of searching-to-be-offended psycho who thinks everything in the world should come with a "trigger warning."

For instance, the sort of person flipping out about how horrid the recently pulled Batgirl cover was. Strangely they'll usually also be the same sort of hypocritical person who flips out anytime a book they like is censored, because *censorship is wrong*.

 It also can come from being under massive amounts of stress. 




 I was under the impression that most carnivorous plants ate meat to make up for a lack of nitrogen in their environments, not CO2. 




 Sadly there are a lot of really rich people \*caugh\*thekochbrothers\*cough\* who can't grasp that concept. 




 Well, govem we are willing to drop bombs on entire funerals full of civilians to take out a single bad guy, i think we've pretty well decided in one direction already. 




 Hey! Thank you for the honest feedback. I 100% agree with you on everything you are saying, and if it was something I was used to putting together I would totally be going for high end components. But my big concern is that this is the first one I am working on, period, and if I screw it up I'd rather have lost a 105$ piece of junk than several hundred dollars worth of gear. I'm looking at this as a hobby, and this is just me cutting my teeth, and in the future they're probably going to have way higher end gear.

I'm not expecting amazing results, and I fully expect a few mistakes, but I'd rather screw up cheap bargain-bin parts than really nice choice components. I see this guy being a schlepping instrument, that will be retired to a nice case on a wall when I build another one with really nice parts.

Plus this lets me trace the body blank on to some graph paper so in the future I can hopefully make and route the body myself. 




 Free cookies in exchange for potentially saving someone's life. Worth it. Not like I need all that blood anyways.

Plus as a male, there's [a body of evidence](http://www.webmd.com/men/features/too-much-iron-in-your-blood) showing that it's actually a good idea to donate blood frequently to prevent iron buildup in your bloodstream.

So, free cookies, saving someone's life, and extending your own. 




 Perhaps; there are many, many ways to add pauses - for dramatic effect or otherwise - I suppose anyway... 




 Thank you so much!
 




 So, followup questions - if a neck has a 56mm heel width, am I looking for a body that has a 56mm neck pocket? Or can I sand that down? Or am I getting the measurements completely mixed up?

Also, is it safe to assume a neck will have a slot for a truss rod?

Sorry for the peppering of questions - like I said, kind of still trying to figure this out. 




 Simple but good example: Food service.

Not paying sick days essentially forces a low income earner (the sort of person who would be working at a food service job in most cases) to choose between taking sick days to get better, or sucking it up and going to work. They don't have the option of choosing to go to work or not because they likely live paycheck to paycheck - losing a day of pay could literally mean no food on the table or not paying rent.

So, they go to work sick. While there, they then expose food and other workers to their illness. They also are less productive while working. Other coworkers become sick, and you lose even more productivity as the sickness spreads through your workforce. Customers potentially get sick, and if it's bad enough that customers track you down, you are exposing yourself to massive lawsuits.

Between a multimillion dollar lawsuit worst case scenario and giving a worker the day off with pay when they are sick - well, which would you rather pay?

I have a personal theory that many people have a difficult time understanding indirect consequences of actions, or maybe they understand them but have a harder time comprehending the spidering-out chain of effects that their actions create. Because sadly, there are dragons in those effects. 




 Honestly - I built a pinewood derby car in high school, and a stool in boyscouts. So, basically none.

I kinda thought an electric might be a good way to start, especially since outside of hardware and wiring it looks like I could put one together for less than $100.

I've also wanted a bass, and it looks like they have a few bass necks, which could be fantastic. 




 Well, was the tech wrong?

 Hey everyone!
I am looking to build out my workbench first, but after that I want to start on my first guitar build. Originally I had considered doing a ukulele build first (kits are cheap) to get my feet wet, but then some folks pointed me towards the guitarfetish warehouse sale.

Ultimately I want to build acoustics, but I feel like getting my feet wet with ANY guitar build will be a great way to start. Is this a sensible approach? Or should I just spring for an acoustic kit and ignore the electrics?

I think this exactly what I saw before - I thought it was just for amazon but I remembered incorrectly. Thank you!!!! 




 Hey everyone. I think I remember seeing a service like this before. Specifically I want to purchase a guitar kit from either Blues Creek Guitar or Stewart Macdonald, but neither accepts bitcoin (and I haven't been able to get a response when sending emails suggesting it).

So, it sounds like I need a service where someone would purchase the kit for me in exchange for bitcoin. I know I've seen something like this for amazon, but what about the WWW at large??

 You are correct, but it's important to note that those rules apply specific to "[public accommodations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12181)".

I still don't understand how the protection of sexuality isn't covered. If I was a gay guy banging another gay guy, and a business finds out and says they won't do business with me, they are essentially discriminating against me because my partner is male and not female. So it's essentially discrimination of sex via a proxy. 




 You seriously may have just secured my wife and I's retirement. We've talked about retiring in the Netherlands for years, and it appears this is EXTREMELY common there.

 Hey everyone!
I am a complete newbie, starting from scratch. So far I have the Bernstein book (I literally picked it up this evening) but I was wondering if there are other books I should take a look at?
My ultimate goal is a small setup for raising tilapia and growing plants, most likely similar to this one:

Any advice would be really helpful. I'd also appreciate advice if this may be shooting a bit high to start :) 




 You are both pragmatic, and a good dog owner. Rate up! 




 Which is why, to this day, I don't use dishwashers. My first apartment had a dishwasher, and I just put dishes in, and they never came out clean. My roommate advised me that I had to wash and scrub them down beforehand.

If I have to wipe them down with a wet cloth already, i may as well make the cloth wet with soapy water and just spend 2 seconds more scrubbing and be done with them.

The machines don't serve much of a point to me unless I have a sudden massive amount of easily cleaned dishes (cocktail parties are a great example) 




 It's the reverse here. My wife will usually grab things as soon as I set them down, often before I'm done. I usually don't mind unless it suddenly leads to problems like scorching (because I couldn't stir fast enough), or nice sear marks turning into burn marks (because she stole my tongs). 




 This is good advice, but requires you to have downtime as you go. That's not always the case. Especially if you are doing things that readily burn and require constant stirring. I'll give OP benefit of the doubt :)

 Do fulfillment centers exist for food products? I have been working on starting my business repackaging and selling spices. It's easy for me to do at home and ship, but can I tell the fulfillment center "here's a 50lb bag of cumin seed, customer ordered 1oz of ground cumin, please grind 1 oz of cumin and ship?" 




 Any idea how precise the scale needs to be? I have an older kitchen scale which is a bit finicky but can handle measurements down to ~4 gram precision or so. 




 If this is true, Drs. Sheldon Cooper and Leonard Hofstadter will be devastated. 




 Hey everyone. I have been curious about this for awhile. The actual act of buying/selling is easy. My big concern is making sure that packages get out to customers in a timely way.

I am still starting, so any volume that I would generate would be miniscule, and likely way too small for a fulfillment center to be interested.

Did you pay for custom packaging? How do you handle boxing and adding packing material? This stuff, if you go to office max or even the post office is absurdly expensive. Enough so that I lose any kind of competitive edge. The post office offers free shipping boxes, but the flat rate is really high - $9+.

So far I have just been saving boxes and as much packing material as possible from Amazon. Some guy I know also tried getting a bunch of free boxes from USPS and inverting them until he found out it was a felony :( 




 I don't either. It was always instilled in me early on that your pet is family. Not just "a pet." You've taken them in, they are with you for life through thick and thin.

 Not sure. I think the fact that people aren't driving the train, they have a big metal shield blocking them from really comprehending what happened literally a few feet away. Kinda like hearing about a murder on the news - it's ethereal and doesn't really have much impact on you most of the time. So instead to them it's just lost time that they're stuck on the train.

If they actually saw the body or if they're on the front of the train and they see the person hit, that would probably change their tune a bit. But maybe not.

The drivers and ticket takers are always really on edge though - it hits them pretty hard (as you would expect). 




 Well, it may not be quite what you are looking for, but I have been on several trains where a person has jumped in front of the train (you didn't specify the kind of accident). Usually you just feel the train screech to a halt. The ticket takers start going nuts and run to the front of the train. About 10 minutes passes and an intercom message plays that there appears to have been a fatality, and to please be patient. At that point you realize you are stuck for the next minimum of 30 minutes until another train can be redirected towards you. They pull the trains side by side so you can't see anything, and then move you over to the other train.

Other passengers usually flip out about how "selfish" the person was to screw up their day, and you question why exactly it is wrong to punch complete strangers for being such assholes who can't realize that their minor inconvenience was a day in someone's life that was so bad that it made them jump in front of a train.

There have been 2 times where I have seen the body. There's a lot of blood, and not much recognizable as a person. 




 When her only defense is that "she feared for her life" and the DA himself says that he never once pointed or directed towards her, his hands were empty, and she waited 4 seconds between shots into the back of an unarmed man, yes, exactly.

That's why she's been charged. 




 FYI, the camera from her tazer shows that he was struggling to remove the barb from his back when she opened fire. The DA himself said the video evidence is damning considering his hands were empty and he never once gestured towards her, and it clearly seems he was trying to remove the barbs from his back. She also waited 4 seconds between shots. Because,  you know, apparently the guy she shot once in the back was still a threat.

As for not responding immediately - let's try something. Have someone shoot you in the back with a tazer and start barking commands at you. See how soon you can start responding. 




 My god, of all the breeds, I think pits/staffies have the absolute best smiles. 




 Yeah, they "try to make it better" by threatening to stop policing if anyone criticizes dangerous officers, a la the NYPD. Police will gladly hold the public hostage the second someone tries to wave accountability in their direction. 




 Cop just indicted in Pennsylvania for stopping a man for an out of date registration sticker, pulling him out of his car, laying him face down, and shooting him to death in the back.

And the rest of the police that everyone says are "so noble" will be gladly paying into the union coffers to finance wave after wave of appeals to ensure that this officer eventually gets their job back with back pay, or at the very least, a full pension.

Because not a single goddamned cop actually wants to police themselves, just us "normals." 




 For a damn image. I know what I searched for. 




 No, I googled a creature from the game. I did not "google a spoiler."

At worst, I expected links for the beast to pop up. I did not expect the very first link to show the name of the beast's identity. 




 This may be the best comment I've read today! 




 Good dog!! 




 Um, that when I google "infamous beast" that I could find a picture, and not have the first result show me the identity of the beast? 




 I understand what you are saying, but I have to disagree somewhat. You're ok with raising for food lifeforms whose evolutionary path diverged from ours 50 million years ago, but not lifeforms whose evolutionary path diverged from ours 10 million years ago (dates are wrong obviously, but I think you understand my meaning). I don't agree with that distinction.

As for the land - most studies of the least harm doctrine have asserted that a mix of both animal and plant agriculture minimizes the actual loss of life. Remember that when land is used for plant agriculture, there is still a staggering loss of life. Native plant species are cleared en masse, and that often leads to mass starvation of native animal species. Rerouting waterways for irrigation can cause further damage in similar ways. The act of preparing soil, tilling and harvesting kills massive numbers of soil-dwelling mammals. The word pesticide is a portmanteau that means "killer of pest animals." So, even if we switched to pure plant agriculture, animals will still die as a direct result, even if we haven't raised them for it. And sadly, it's often in larger numbers than in animal agriculture (I'm only talking about direct impact, not indirect where the numbers go all over the place on each side of the fence).

There's not a simple answer to this one, as much as I wish there was. 




 I'm familiar with it, actually! Very good sci-fi movie.

Honestly, I suppose it isn't that far off.

Still, it's far better that the animals be treated well than forced to put in restrictive enclosures. I mean, ultimately, they are being raised for food. At some point, they will die. There is no way to sugar coat that. It's the brutal truth. But at least while they're alive they can be treated with dignity and given a modicom of respect, you know?

 Hey, first, I am a meat eater. So I want to get that out of the way. I also do my best to support small local farmers. I also hunt when I have the opportunity.

Do you feel that a lot of videos similar to yours that are heavily publicized purposefully forget to mention that this is factory farms that perform these practices, and NOT all meat processors or, worse, farmers?

I have family who work in the farming industry, and take their animals to be harvested at small processors. The animals are treated extremely well until the end. But watching most of these videos, it seems like names are often replaced with blanket terms. So instead of "Smithfield meats does this" it is advertised as "Farmers do this!" or "Meat processors do this!" Instead of showing the more truthful message that this isn't how it's done everywhere, the videos seem to specifically omit names to create a sort of "everyman" out of the industry.

PETA is notorious for this.

I understand that the bulk of Americans get their meat from factory farms (and these videos ARE necessary to prevent abuse), but painting the entire industry with the same brush also hurts those small farmers and meat processors who really do treat animals properly until the end. 




 Dear god someone needs to make sure this is the top post on this thread. Please. Contact your representatives. Get involved. For once congress is doing the right thing!!

 I know several cops. Most of them perform the minimum amount of range time required because they'd like to actually spend time with their families when not on the clock. Sure they may visit every now and then to hang out, but it's usually more camaraderie than it is for focused training.

Remember, cops aren't intended to be soldiers, they are intended to be civil servants. Not all of them want to be dirty harry. The problem is when you place someone who hasn't had that much range time or, more importantly, live fire training in a high pressure situation, their trigger fingers can get itchy - hence police racking up over 5000 civilian deaths since 2001, while only 1800 police officers have been KIA. In January of this year, 176 civilians were killed by police in the US alone. That's more than the average number of officers KIA for an entire year. That's why we're seeing sweeping criticisms coming down from the justice department because of how bad training is for cops to deal with those situations.

If we insist on arming cops with firearms (which is the only sensible course since civilians can have guns in the US), they really should require live fire training.

I wonder what ratio of those 5000+ civilians were shot by a cop who was a combat veteran, vs cops who weren't?

 So, where would one apply to sling lead down range and shoot poachers in the face? I understand and totally appreciate the approach being taken. It's the right thing to do.

But seriously, shooting poachers in the face sounds like a great way to dissuade them from poaching. 




 Just an advanced warning, do not google "infamous beast" or go on the Infamous wikia wiki site and type "the beast." It automatically redirects you to the identity of the beast, and kind of ruins the surprise.

 Molds are weird. Some science fir you...

If you have a layer of good mold, and a spot of bad mold, the good mold CAN overtake the bad. Or vice versa.

The real problem is that mold spreads through something called "mycelium" which is kind of like a plant's root system, except far more efficient at moving chemicals from point a to point b. That is a big concern. If the bad mold produces any toxins, they can absolutely get picked up by the good mold and transported through most of the mycelial network. 

So even if you cut off "bad mold" the "good mold" may now be toxic.

 A buddy of mine lived in Japan for several years. You are totally correct about their culture, especially so far as work goes, being very uptight, precise, and stressful. However, Japanese folks on the whole are also incredible at cutting loose after the work day ends. Japanese bars are a sight to behold after work. 




 Pretty simple question I hope. I have an extremely long commute to/from work (about 2.5 hours each way). Along the way, just about every day I see several old pieces of furniture on the curb.

After seeing the prices of some hardwood, I can't help but think this would be a great way to get free source materials.

My biggest concern though - pests. For instance, if it's upholstered, there is a chance that it could harbor bed bugs (they're rampant in our area). If I put it in my car, the bed bugs could take up residency there, and from that point it would just be a matter of time until they made it into my house. So, upholstered stuff just isn't worth the risk given that problem.

What about wooden furniture? What kinds of pests could I be bringing into my house if I brought, say, a desk? What mitigation can I do to ensure I don't bring anything unsavory home? 




 Oh my god, I was actually thinking of this last night. And here it is on reddit. /u/Niferwee, get out of my head!! 




 Just want to bolster this. In any time you are dealing with chemical exposure to living things, some are going to be more robust against the chemical than others. This is why in humans, when talking about material safety we refer to it in terms of LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of the people exposed). The same applies across all living things. Those who survive are by definition more robust against that chemical (for one reason or another). If they are capable of reproducing, at least some of their offspring will likely inherit this trait.

This is a textbook case of how evolution works.

 I do remember a ton of Russian/Polish/Moldovan places in Brooklyn  too (I had a ton of friends from Moldova). Great food, but watch out for those expiration dates! :) 




 That's great - but I think you're missing that Acadians WERE French. They were some of the early settlers on North America, and they brought Beignets with them. They then migrated southward where, etymologically speaking, Acadian transformed into "Cajun." So, like I said above, the French can still probably claim Beignets, but just not in mainland France. They're the state food of Loiusiana. Whereas in France... they're just another pastry. The level of emphasis placed on them is considerably different. I'm not saying this out of disrespect to the French culinary tradition, but Cajuns place beignets on a pedestal the French simply don't.

Further, France didn't "invent" them per se. The French beignet, like most carnival doughnuts, is an evolution of the Roman pastry scriblita. 




 You would think that, but check the wikipedia article for beignets - while the french invented them, New Orleans is the place that's famous for them (specifically Cafe du Monde). Heck, just google "beignet" and you'll see what I mean. They're the state food of Louisiana.

And remember - Cajun culture IS French culture, at least originally - Cajun came from ["Acadian"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadians), early French immigrants to north america. So technically the French are still the most famous for it, just not from mainland France. 




 This is going to be a long post, sorry! I agree it is most likely a variation. My point is people are going after OP because it isn't "authentic," but this is one of those cases where you really have to question "authentic". Lots of other doughnuts aren't entirely authentic - especially not this style. It's a carnival style doughnut (made with all of the crap you had to clean out of your pantry before lent so you wouldn't get tempted). Just like fasnachts, beignets, kinklings, malasadas, and so on.

So does it match what you'd see all over Poland? Probably not, but that also doesn't mean there isn't a single baker there who doesn't prepare it differently. For example, here's yet another form, pczki serowe from a polish baker, in Poland:

http://sprawdzonakuchnia.pl/wp-content/uploads/ewpt_cache/960x640_50_1_c_FFFFFF_cfe767548249254abeae462fa0b2627d.jpg

That's still Polish pczki but appears completely different. Like I said - all of these pastries are variations on a theme: big fatty pastries that you eat to clean all of the lard and other naughty goods out of your pantry before lent. They show up all over Europe, so I'd expect to see massive numbers of different variations. Just because one family does it different from the norm doesn't really make it incorrect, just different. Most of these doughnut recipes were dictated by what was in the pantry. If one family was incredibly poor they may not have had fruit/cream on hand regularly, and so developed their recipe not having any fruit or cream. If one family was wealthy but still wanted to participate in lent, they may have had to cut the pczki so they could stuff everything from the pantry into them (a la OP). Most families would probably fall somewhere in the middle - stuffed fruit inside of the pastry, matching what most Polish folks are used to (a la the traditional pastry you mentioned). That's how these recipes developed. They're a big festival food that served a specific purpose (cleaning out the pantry) so variations are bound to happen based on all kinds of factors.

The whole "It's right!"/"It's Wrong!" argument in a recipe like this is like arguing there is a set ingredient list for ratatouille. In reality it was a dish made by poor people who made it with whatever they had on hand. Fighting for authenticity is a fool's errand because the ingredient list was determined entirely by what was in the garden.

I agree that there is a common notion of what the pastry should be, but that doesn't mean that other family's recipes for the same pastry are inherently wrong - they might just have a different evolution than the popular one. 




 TIL that most cultures have their own fat tuesday donuts. I have only ever heard of having fasnachts on [Fat Tuesday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasnacht_%28doughnut%29) but apparently these guys serve the same purpose for the Polish culture. 

And if the dough is anything like fashachts (which, based on the description it is), it is going to be relatively high in calorie (about 500 calories) - they're made from potato starch water, flour, sugar, milk, egg, salt, yeast and lard, and then deep fried. That is just the dough before you add any kind of filling. In the case of fasnachts, they're usually either served plain, or covered in powdered sugar/sugar glaze/granulated sugar, and often people cut them open and spread molasses/table syrup on them. 




 At my old job, I was lucky to be across the street from a Polish deli. The food was cheap, and incredible. I also noticed that as I went back the portions kept getting bigger and bigger :)

If you are ever near Philadelphia, north Philly has a ton of Russian/Polish neighborhoods that you would love. 




 Relax. Pastries don't always look 100% identical for a number of reasons, and it doesn't always have to do with "legitimacy."

[Biegnet in Paris](http://voyages.ideoz.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Berliner-boules-de-berlin-beignet.jpg)

All of these are donuts/zeppole/biegnets. They're just either different family recipes, varieties, or regional interpretations. I mean, New Orleans is supposed to set the standard for beignets, but every time I've been to Paris beignets look extremely dissimilar, and the dish in New Orleans evolved from French Beignets. Both are legitimate. Same goes with the donuts and zeppole. 




 These look like a weird cross between whoopie pies and zeppoli. I approve! 




 You got it!

 Nope, not yet. It's on the "to buy" list. I can borrow one from the father-in-law. My tool set is rather limited right now, though I am looking to expand. Googling router sleds - this could be perfect! I wanted to make a way wider than normal cutting board and 16"+ planers are incredibly expensive. This seems like it would solve that. Thank you! 




 The issue wasn't so much the cost of the wood (I can talk to the wife) - the issue is more that every plan I've found requires a planer, and outside of a cheap one I found at harbor freight for $280, the prices for planers quickly soar. I know I can plane by hand but I'm really concerned about how even I can get it by hand 




 Thanks! I had actually posted something similar on /r/luthier awhile ago and just got rated down. Didn't leave a good first impression, so I figured I would ask here :(

I will definitely look into a workbench! It looks like a really useful first project, and I'm pretty sure it can be assembled without too huge of a spend.
 




 You are *technically* correct, the best kind of correct! 




 Hey everyone.
I really want to begin woodworking, specifically with an eye towards instrument making. However before I start getting into really expensive tonewoods, I want to make sure I have an ok collection of tools and have some experience woodworking under my belt. As the title says, I am a complete newbie. Beyond a pinewood derby car, cutting some crown molding, and shop class in high school, I don't have much experience at all with woodworking. I want to change that.

I had wanted to start by making an end-grain cutting board, but when I saw the price of hardwood (moreso when my wife saw it) there was a very loud lack of enthusiasm. In addition, every plan I've seen required a planer which I don't have. I was looking at the prices of them and it seems like a hefty jump for a first project.

So, can anyone recommend some simple projects for someone who has very few tools and very little experience? I don't mind picking up one tool, so long as it can be purchased reasonably.

I have a 10" miter saw, a table saw, and a jigsaw (outside of the normal tools like hammers/drills/etc). Any advice would be really appreciated. 




 Yeah, ive seen it spelled out as AP cake, or apea cake. We used to have it all the time - I grew up in Oley, near Reading :) 




 This is not only delicious looking, but it is freaking beautiful. The downside is it seems like it would be a bitch to serve. 




 Damn, you are old. Thank god I'm not that old.

Until may.

...damn.

SCREW YOU LITTLE GIRL! 




 What the title says. I grew up in PA dutch land, but for the life of me I can't find a decent apea cake recipe online. My family doesn't really have one. Most of the ones I find online have a ton of extra crap that simply doesn't exist in Amish versions (seriously, they don't use nuts, they don't use raisins, etc). Any family or otherwise decent recipes would be very much appreciated.

For those who aren't familiar, Apea cake is an extremely dense PA Dutch coffee cake.  




 Ive found stevia is good in things that work well with an herbal flavor, like hot tea or herbal soda syrup. Anything where the taste is not herbal, it sticks out like a sore thumb, and not in a good way.

Try it in a cup of coffee, then try it in a cup of tea and you'll see what I mean

 Actually, they are. They're a cold weather crop, just like most brassicas.

 "Full-grown sprouts keep well on the plant in cold weather, making them a great winter harvest item for gardeners in the South (planted in fall). In cold climates, gardeners often bury Brussels sprouts plants up to their tops in hay or leaves in late fall, then pull off the little sprouts as needed through winter."

 First, I'd see if you are near an Indian grocer. A lot of times they have spices in whole form that can then be ground fresh in the home. Whole spices last MUCH longer than ground. Plus at ethnic markets you can buy them in reasonable bulk for a fraction of the price. For instance, instead of buying ground ginger (which could already be a year or more old when you pick it off the shelf so it has very little flavor), go to the indian market, pay a fraction of the price for whole dried ginger and throw it in a spice grinder when you need it.

The same goes with turmeric, dried chilies, cinnamon, black peppercorns, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, etc - there are a bunch available. Just eyeball what you think you'll need and grind up a little more. Grab a few spice containers (or save the ones you have now) to put leftovers in.

You end up paying less for a more stable product that produces superior results. 




 Root parsley is amazing. It's like carrots, celery, and parsley had a 3-way baby. It's definitely worth trying if you can find it.

 Ahh, I too have to deal with the non-dairy non-gluten vegetarian challenge every time our friends get together. Here is a personal favorite (recipe based on the 2nd issue of Co-Operative magazine, but with some personal flare). The whole thing takes maybe a half hour with prep.

**Citrus Curd**

* Finely grated zest of 3 citrus fruits (at least 1 lemon)
* Juice of those 3 fruits (again, at least 1 lemon)
* 3 large eggs
* 2 free range egg yolks
* 175g caster sugar (just throw regular sugar into a food processor for 1 minute, don't waste money buying it)
* 100g unsalted butter cut in chunks

**Optional meringue:**

* Reserve the 2 whites from the yolks above
* 100g additional caster sugar
* pinch cream of tartar
* 1.5tsp cornstarch dissolved into 2 tbsp of water

Bring a pot of water to a boil, and grab a large mixing bowl that can be set over top. A double boiler works well too. Whisk together the juice, zest, 175g sugar, eggs, and yolks and place the double boiler/bowl over the boiling water, making sure it is not in contact with the water. Add the butter and keep whisking. Once the butter has melted, keep stirring until thickened (the specific term you are looking for here is nappe, when the curd can coat the back of a spoon, and when you can see trails where the whisk has been). This should be about 175 to 180 (do NOT go beyond that).

Use your eyes and see if there are any chunks of curdled eggs. If so, strain through a sieve. Serve into single serving ramekins or cups. Allow to cool. 

**Optional:** Before serving, whisk the reserved eggwhites with the cornstarch slurry and a pinch of cream of tartar until they are at soft peaks (cornstarch will prevent the meringue from sweating if it sits out for awhile). Add the remaining 100g of caster sugar slowly while whisking. Bring to stiff peaks. Place a dollop on top of the curd and and hit with a blowtorch to brown the meringue. Be really careful if doing this in plastic serving dishes. It may also be a good idea to use pasteurized eggs if you take this route.

The scale and induction cooktop are must haves, the rest just make life faster and easier  




 Cooking is just a set of simple techniques you combine. There are very few "single use" techniques out there.

Also, there are no set ingredients on provincial food. Poor people used what they had. Don't worry about "authentic" ingredients because poor people didn't usually have the luxury of being choosy. Trying to be authentic usually makes dishes inauthentic. 




 Chickpea tuna salad. Mash up canned chickpeas with a potato masher or fork. Treat like tuna and make "tuna salad". Serve on pitas or rolls. 




 Hey everyone. I am growing these in the garden for the first time this year (my garden is going fallow for a year to get rid of some pest infestations and give some fungal problems a year to die away).

I fully expect to have a ton of the buttons on hand - I'm sowing a ton of seeds. However I can find very little on how to store the buttons for the long term.

Can they be dried? Can I freeze them?

I will probably xpost this in /r/gardening because it kind of straddles discussion about gardening and how to store an ingredient. 




 Eh, not my thing but if it gets a few more folks to make music, why not.

Sure it's lazy, but I can see some folks being interested if they have muscle problems or just lack the confidence. 




 One does not simply.... see what a helicopter can do. 




 Thank you so much, you've been a big help! 

After more research, I am thinking of picking up some cheap "project" or otherwise broken guitars on ebay to get started. I figure it will let me know the lay of the land, and I can start to build up the tools organically as I fix things. Maybe I can even make a few bucks once I get better at it.

Again, thank you a lot. 




 No idea :( 




 Ordered on the 13th of January, ship date is between May 27th and July 2nd.

After getting frustrated by reading people who placed their orders a week ago get ship dates a month sooner than me, I called amazon to find out what was going on. Apparently their order systems are overloaded and aren't really built to handle this sort of massive backorder. They're working to resolve it, but if you ordered in the past 2 weeks your shipping time may be off quite a bit. 




 Groovy! At the very least, it'll make the bottom drop out on the SEK-2000 kits :) 




 Hey everyone. I really want to take a stab at a kit guitar to get started. I've been looking at Blues Creek guitar kits, and they seem to have fantastic support.

I know I need to get some hand tools, but the one thing I am most concerned about is either buying or building a binding jig. Is this necessary? I'm trying to make my first build as affordable as possible because there's a good chance I'll cock it up somehow :)

Are there any other required tools that I really need to get started? I know i need to get a jigsaw - I have a tablesaw to build some of the jigs if necessary (even if they won't be beautiful). 




 I ordered mine on January 12th, and was given an estimate of May 27th to July 2nd. Wtf. 




 First, I'll probably get rated down for this, but frankly my karma is skyhigh and I really don't care.

Is anyone else a bit frustrated with how this rollout is going? I ordered as soon as I realized an invite was available to me (it went into my spam bucket for a few days), and was given an estimate of May 27th to July 2nd. Now, I see posts [like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/2ygdx9/question_about_wait_time_for_echo_invite/) that show an estimate from May 20th to June 15th. I placed my order on January 12th. Why the hell is a user who ordered a week ago receiving a unit ahead of me?

Last night there was a post that Amazon is [making refurb units available](http://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/2zn7s4/fyi_refurbished_units_are_available_for/) but there are still tons of users who haven't even gotten new units yet.

If they have refurb units available, why aren't they making it an option for users who have been waiting for months now? Especially when they're going to let new buyers seemingly get bumped to the head of the line.

On top of it, when I and another user "dared" to comment on that thread about how it was frustrating, we both got downvoted to hell.

This rollout is incredibly frustrating, and it seems like people on this sub are perfectly happy to downvote anyone who mentions it. 




 Not to threadjack, but did he mention anything about 2012 sets? Sammy promised 4 years of updates, and 5 years of support. So far the only specs I've seen on the SEK-3000 are that it supports f-series and higher. I have a 51" e7000 and can't find much of anything about it. 




 I wonder how it would fare in conjunction with chamomile? 




 Trey and Matt got tired of it, thats why they started southparkstudios.com so you can watch the series for free. 




 Good. Fark them and any other idiots who think that suing the people who support you is a good idea. 




 Alone in the world is a little catdog :( 




 Yup, its open to all. They will ask if you have a business or if its for personal use. They are literally next door to another store called restaurant depot that requires an affiliation. Guess which one usually has a full parking lot :) because it gets them lots of business, I dont think they have any plans to change.

I go there to get stuff like trays, cooling racks, bone cleavers and other knives that are meant to get beat to hell, pizza peels, graduated food storage containers, etc.

About 3/4ths of the place is equipment, 1/4th is canned goods, mixes, yeasts, etc. 




 Kinda frustrating that they have refurb stock when I am still backordered from late may to late july.  




 Dear OP, I'm guessing you're across the world from me, but if I am ever in the same country would you mind giving me a ride? I'll pay for fuel and help you with the preflight checklist. I love flying. I especially love flying like this. 




 Yeah, that's basically how it tastes. It's an interesting cheese because unlike most other cheeses that are made from curd, gjetost is made by simmering leftover whey down for hours until it turns to sludge. The caramel flavor and sweetness comes from the whey caramelizing. It should be sliced really thin. It goes great on crackers or with toast for breakfast, but I'm a cheese geek, lol.

 Hmm... well... what has he been most interested in? Is he looking for recipes, or science, or techniques? "The Professional Chef" from the CIA is a killer book if he's interested in learning techniques along with recipes.

If you don't have it, see if you can get a copy of the Fannie Farmer Cookbook (or if you're really lucky, a copy of the Boston School of Cooking Cookbook - they're the same thing, but the Boston one is the much older name).

Another thing you could try - see if there are any library or charity book sales in the area. A lot of times you can find tons of cookbooks for cheap - you can grab a bunch and see if any tickle his fancy. 




 Google "donburi" and go wild. They're fantastic dishes that are entirely centered around rice. Usually, it's rice with some kind of enchanting broth or gravy poured over it.

Also, learn to cook some Indian food :) 




 It sounds like you're talking about gjetost, and I've never heard of someone not liking it before. That's sad :(

 Mama mia!

Seriously though, it goes excellent in soup. Make some chicken broth and bring it to a simmer. Slice escarole into 1/4 inch strips and add into broth (you can also wilt it in another pan, but meh to extra dishes). Season with salt and pepper.

If you want to go really fancy, you can add some pasta, chunk up some parmesean/ramano rinds, and small parbroiled meatballs (place them under a broiler for about 1-2 minutes, not long) to your soup. You'll have essentially created a very simple italian wedding soup. 




 Your recipe seems correct. However you are missing one last step - you have to "fluff" couscous after you have cooked it. Take a fork (or rice paddle) or two and start to toss it around in the bowl and then transfer to another container. 

If it seems really dry, you can boil more liquid and pour it into the couscous and re-cover for a few more minutes. Then fluff again. This becomes important when you're making really large amounts of it (like if you are using it to stuff a crown rack or something) because the ratios get weird.

It's really easy stuff to work with. Try not to overthink it :) 




 Depends how it's been made. If it's fairly plain, I'd say, mash it up add an egg or two, a tbsp or two of milk, and 2 slices of white bread that are ground up (you may need to adjust this). Shape into disks and fry. Improvised latkes. Serve with sour cream.

Or trade it to some of your college buddies in exchange for beer. Then drink the beer. 




 It's also great for other college activities. Going camping for the weekend? Bring your skillet. The best part about cast iron is the damn things are nigh indestructible. 




 If you are near northern NJ, the Allentown/Bethlehem/Easton PA area has a chain called "The Restaurant Store" that doesn't require an affiliation. Should be about an hour and a half from you. I'm lucky to live about 10 minutes away.

http://www.therestaurantstore.com/

It's worth the trip if you want to stock up on stuff. 




 Another reason you missed - you can't put nonstick cookware in dishwashers. Most decent sized kitchens will have industrial dishwashers these days. 




 Cast iron. It doubles as a weapon that can be used in self-defense.

 You slap him and take it back. Knife abuse is not allowed on /r/cooking. 




 Yup, this is pretty much all you need to do. Usually I do this after using my ice cream maker anyway (because my kitchenaid mixer ice cream maker sucks and I really miss my old donvier handcrank one).

Usually I make it first thing in the morning, and set a timer every 30 minutes. When it goes off, scrape it up and stir it. Repeat until it's a nice smooth texture. Your goal is to prevent large ice crystals from forming. 




 I'd pick up the Good Eats series for him. If he already has it, pick out a few of the Americas Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated/Cook's Country season cook books. 




 Interesting, I'll take a look.
Honestly, a lot of it comes down to semantic arguments. There were gas chambers. They were used. People were gassed to death. Whether it was carbon monoxide or HCN, it doesn't really matter. Fact is, folks were murdered en masse.

Edit: Interesting - it looks like both were used. Auschwitz/Birkenau used HCN, most of the others used exhaust. I guess it really supports the reputation of auschwitz being a death factory :( 
























 Pretty simple question I hope. I am looking to pick up the PA2.0, concentrate trays, and UFO (I'd prefer it over the orbiter). Does anyone know if there are any resellers that carry all 3? I've only been able to find the UFO on the main website. 




 Hey everyone. We have a walmart special HP printer/scanner/copier from black friday 2-3 years ago. We have been refilling the ink cartridges as they run out using a refill kit. The last fill up was about 2 weeks ago. Since then we have printed about 30 pages, all black. But still, attempting to clean the printheads, it appears as if there is no ink left in ANY of the cartridges when you try to print (it's blotchy, same behavior as if they were empty).

I have read that the cartridges eventually die out after about 5 ink refills. Is this the sort of behavior that is normally exhibited? 




 You have a ferret!? 




 Sikhs are hardcore! I wonder if he hides his knife in the turban? 




 The military requirement is new. They used to offer private military arms and tactical training classes. If you completed all of their courses successfully you could apply.

This was... 9 or 10 years ago maybe? 




 I don't so much hate everyone - I hate how illogical and inefficient people are. That's why I tend to like machines far more.

I'm mostly apathetic towards people, but because I frankly view smalltalk as a waste of time and because I am really uncomfortable in conversations, I come across as narcissitic, cold, and standoffish.

I'd like my kid to at least have some ability to communicate well with other people. I totally get what you guys mean. Theyre not going to learn from me so they will just have to practice. 




 Married to an elementary school teacher. My wife has been told to limit physical contact as much as possible - kind of difficult because she is a music performance teacher whose job is to teach kids how to play band instruments. It puts her in a weird place because she isn't supposed to touch kids to correct finger placement on things like saxophones and clarinets.

She is also supposed to try and dissuade kids from touching her, like in hugs and stuff. 




 For our new unix guys, I actually always have them build a new nix box specifically to execute that command so they can see what it does.

It's interesting to see the commands you can execute slowly dissappear until eventually you are left with only shell commands (because the shell is in memory) 




 Awesome work! This may become a permanent fixture in totalterminal if I can get it running on OSX. I'll list my results when I get to the office. 




 "Oo de lally" from Disney's Robin Hood. 




 Yup, but the downside is flank is often a good deal more expensive than round 




 Is every cop a corrupt bully? Probably not. But they all pay dues to the same unions, and those unions directly fund defenses for bad cops. The same unions help sow corruption in our legal system (remember the dude who was killed by cops in NY for selling single cigs?) by ensuring that DA's don't actually do their job in front of grand juries. Oh, and when someone calls them out on their bullshit, they threaten to stop policing - just like the NYPD. Holding the public hostage because a mayor says the public is scared of them - some fucking heroes those "good cops" are. 

Your arguement is essentially "just because they pay for nazis and throw their hats in with nazis, that doesn't make them nazis!" 




 Go to a restaurant store and get one. Unlike other knives a cleaver's job is essentially to be abused. It just doesn't make a lot of sense to spend a ton. 

I don't think ive spent more than 50 dollars and that was on an 10 inch bone cleaver. 




 I'm a telecommunications engineer, with a specialization in voice data. I also support net neutrality. BUT this article is really, factually, incorrect.

First:
 As far as the network is concerned, data is just data - a series of 0s and 1s. A telecom network sees all data as a series of 0s and 1s - whether it is video, text or graphics. That is, in fact, the key advantage of the Internet - it doesn't care what the data is ultimately going to be assembled into - a picture, a text message or voice.

This is *mostly* correct. Data is just data, but all data is subject to varying levels of service. The network DOES care what type of data it is, because several types of data have very different requirements. If a packet (the bits of information that encapsulate all data on the internet when they're in transit) for a lolcat picture shows up 3 seconds late, you probably won't notice - your workstation receives it 3 seconds late, it will figure out what resource it is part of, add the data, and you see your picture. Likewise, if packets are received with varying levels of delay, or are received out of order, you probably won't notice. Everything can be done on a "best effort" basis.

If voice packets to your 911 phone call show up 3 seconds late, your call is going to be completely unintelligible and someone could die as a consequence. Likewise, if your voice packets show up incredibly out of order, or if the amount of delay is all over the place, the call will be unintelligible. The same is true for video. So, while all data is data, not all data is treated equally (hence terms like QoS and DSCP) because it makes no sense to treat all data 100% equally. Just like you wouldn't store people in a cargo compartment of an airplane - different payloads have different requirements. For voice signaling and media to be considered acceptable you essentially need to dedicate a 64Kbps channel to media (more or less, this varies by voice codec, 64kbps is G.711 u-law, the standard). This is data that requires timely delivery, and has specific requirements to ensure that those packets get routed across the network faster than your lolcat pictures so your phone call is actually understandable when you call 911. Video falls in the same bucket to be usable (the big difference is that video on most cable networks is distributed using multicast traffic whereas voice needs to be unicast).

Second:
 As a result, the cost of carrying 1 GB of text data and 1 GB of video data on the Internet is exactly the same. In that sense, neutrality is built into the very structure and essence of the Internet.
So, once it's agreed that 1 GB of video does not stress telecom networks more than 1 GB of text messages, there is absolutely no justification for telcos to discriminate on the basis of what these 0s and 1s will ultimately be put together into.

This one is more problematic. The cost of carrying 1GB of text data is significantly lower than 1GB of video/voice precisely because of what I mentioned above. 1GB of text data likely has no QoS (Quality of Service) requirement attached to it. It doesn't matter if the packets show up in a jumble, the user's software can reassemble them and show them their cat picture and cat story within a few milliseconds. However voice and video require "timely" transmission and receipt. If your voice or video packets show up out of order, are slowed down, or have delays that bounce all over the place (jitter), you have the option of either adding a buffer (which has a noticable impact on user experience) or removing buffers and ensuring that all network equipment along the communication path knows to give that traffic priority. Either way, you have added expense in either user experience, additional equipment, or infrastructure to dedicate bandwidth to that one particular stream of data - something you don't have to do for text data. In addition there are significantly different types of equipment required for specific types of traffic. For example voice data will require SBCs (session border controllers), SIP proxies, application servers, etc to be traversed - again, different hardware is required to process a different type of data. So while it's all 1's and 0's, the way the 1's and 0's are treated is fundamentally different. So, yes, 1GB of voice stresses entirely different equipment than 1GB of text.

Another strike against the article is it, like so many others, treats the internet like a "cloud" when in fact that "cloud" is made up of thousands of different networks that each can impose a toll to send your packets across their borders, and they do. It's the whole basis of the wholesale data/voice industry. Every time a packet traverses network borders, there is an opportunity for a charge to be applied. If it is voice data where there are SLA's (service level agreements) that have to be maintained, there may be even bigger charges. In fact, usually routing tables are often built not on the basis of speed, but on the basis of cost (that's why lots of routers give you the option to choose between them). Not mentioning this shows that the author has a very lay understanding of how the technology works.

Like I said, i am pro net-neutrality (and amazingly enough, most engineers behind telecoms are). But I really wish more of these articles were written by people who were actually in the industry and not folks who don't really understand how converged networks work, or how the modern internet functions. A lot of the pushback on net neutrality makes more sense when you see things from the side of an engineer who maintains them. I still don't like it, but saying "all data is the same!" ignores that all data is different, and therefore the requirements are different.  




 Yup, that sounds similar to mine. I get tiny bubbles, about the 1mm or so (very rarely larger), usually on my fingers. They rarely are red unless I scratch them open.

I wish I could just be a carrier. My system is incredibly weak to the virus. I've had chicken pox 4 times despite being vaccinated. I just cant seem to build up an immunity. 




 Only way to be sure is talk to a dermatologist when they're there. They can culture the fluid if there is enough. I was lucky to have a doctor who had it himself and knew on sight.

It was an illuminating conversation... basically 75 to 80 percent of the adult human population has some strain of herpes. Ever had chicken pox or shingles? Same virus. 




 I wonder if this would help me. I have herpes whitlow (basically tiny bubbles form under the skin of my fingers and occasionally toes). It isn't a terrible case but I do get breakouts when I am stressed - if you GIS it it's about equal to the tamest pics you see.

I'd also love to feel comfortable holding my kid. My parents gave it to me because their doctor always told them it was postular psoriasis and didn't know they could spread it. 




 Fruitbodies of plants mostly. Unlike vegans they can eat honey and cheese. No eggs though.

 The fried potatoes are actually a separate but equally delicious item on the burger :) 

If you look at the bottom half of the bun on the right you can see some dark splotches in the background. That's them. Quarter inch slices of potato fried crispy. 




 Also interesting for Indian cooking,  one of the major religions in India is called Jainism. It is forbidden to hurt living things - any living things - plants included. Eating onion or garlic involves eating the root which kills the plant.

A lot of Jains use a spice called asofoetida (aka hing). You use the spice at the time when you would use onions and garlic, in place of them.

It reeks like death but when it hits hot oil it transforms into something totally awesome. Just store it away from other spices because it reeks havok on them. 




 She sounds like a see-you-next-tuesday.

How presumptuous is that? Or is there more to the story OP? 














 Sounds like she had a hell of a lot of coke. Was she hurting you or anyone else? If not, let her have her time and move on. Too late now, but always remember to try and maintain unconditional positive regard with intoxicated people. You can be the reason they have a bad trip or go coke crazy if you trigger them the wrong way, especially if they aren't experienced psychonauts.

You should have just listened to her theory and not tried to shit all over it. You're not going to shake the confidence of someone who is coked up, so you're just going to make her defensive. And that sounds like exactly what happened.

After a lot of experience - decades - you learn it's best to shrug off what you don't understand - just stay positive and shepherd them through to the other side without judging. It works better for everyone.

 Hey everyone. First, I am a complete newbie. I am trying to design a circuit so that when an IR photoresistor passes a strip of IR LEDs, it starts a piezoelectric buzzer. However all photoresistors I find increase resistance when exposed to light, which is the opposite direction of how I want to go.

Can anyone suggest a better way to implement this, or some reading I should check out to better understand what I am trying to do? 




 I am incredibly impressed this hasnt devolved into a racist flame war and is instead turning into an intelligent conversation. Good show reddit!

 Lampreys are awesome. Unchanged physically for millions of years. Sometimes the design just works. 




 Well, they are, but unlike other carriers they have to support a ton of wimax equipment. They gambled on that standard and lost :(

Gotta suck having to run multiple networks instead of just focusing on lte. 




 When I picked them up I honestly hadn't realized that they came in such nice hobby cases, then I started checking it out. I am kinda wowed! 




 Yup! I have one of their older "electronic learning lab" kits but the books that came with it were utterly terrible. All of the projects are shown with electrical diagrams, but considering they are meant for absolute beginners who have no idea how to read the diagrams.... 




 The whole thing was about 120 dollars before tax. The total savings was like 130 dollars. It was one of those "too good to be true" things.

Ill be going over again today to see if they have any raspberry pi or arduino kits. Also IR LEDs and line sensors. 




 Hey - I was able to get it using the method you said. Sadly some of the end grain tore out but it is still getting glued and screwed in place so I'm not worried.

Thanks so much for your help! 




 The issue I am running into is that the drill seems to catch on to the wood and literally pull itself through. The initial pilot hole was tough, but as I am stepping up I have very little resistance.

Like I said, my concern is that it will pull itself through and wreck it :/

Should I step back on the drill speed? 




 Hey everyone. I am trying to repair a chair that has a cracked leg brace. It appears to have 4 countersunk holes (one in each corner). The issue is that the countersink is approximately a half inch into the wood. This image hopefully shows what I mean:
http://imgur.com/tMvo6k0

All I have is a hand drill... I know I need a 1/2 inch diameter countersink bit, but how would I get it a half inch deep? Do I need to use a drill press for this?

Sorry, I know this is probably a really simple question, I appreciate any help you can offer. 




 Yeah, Ive wanted to get the set for a year now but the price was so high. But with the massive discount, I couldn't help but grab it. It'll be a fantastic way to remember radioshack I think

 F*cking miracles 




 I'll ask because the title is "no stupid questions" - this is a bit meta - 
Why, in general, is this sub so unfriendly?

A few weeks ago I posted about tonewoodamp, asking if anyone had played with it and what they had thought. No responses, just immediate ratedowns. It was topical. I had appropriate flair on the post. But nothing.

I posted a few days later about what the finish was on a little Martin - again, no comments, just ratedowns. Again, topical, with appropriate flair.

It feels like anyone who asks a salient question on this sub gets rated down immediately, and the mods don't really give a damn to stop it. I've pretty much stopped using the sub because of it. I mean, what is the point when you ask a valid question and just get rated down without anyone bothering to provide any information? 




 You da real mvp, little kid. 




  a public omission
 Admission?

Yup, good catch! I'll correct my post because it's a very different meaning. 




 Thank you so much!!!! 




 I'm glad to see you're not so much of a shill anymore. My memory of you from hashtalk was you berating every single person who dared to ask a question.

They'd point out that something didn't make sense, or that the $20 floor wasn't being honored, and then you'd chime in that "this has been discussed a thousand times" and then start slinging insults like a petulant child. Then Garza made you into a mod because you were so good at shilling for GAW. Hell, I remember you insulting me because I advocated people hedging their bets in case of XPY failing. I said there was no good reason to trust GAW, you said I didn't know what I was talking about (though in a way more juvenile way). Good thing I didn't take your advice - who knows about the other people who read your posts while you were trying to make me appear stupid. Guess I was right, huh? 

Or how about that time I posted that it was concerning how quick the mods were to ban or shadow ban anyone who asked difficult questions, and how it was giving the forum a bad image as an echo chamber? You swooped in to tell me off because "I didn't know what I was talking about," along with other juvenile insulting tirades. Man, I guess I was right again.

I wonder, when Garza made you a mod on HT, how many people did you censor? How many people who were telling the truth did you ban? How many more did you berate for asking good, valid, uncomfortable questions? How many lives do you think you helped destroy because you helped usher Garza's charade along? Do you sleep well at night knowing how much you supported his scams and some people could literally be homeless because of you? Does that bother you at all?

Whatever happened to those documents and emails you were going to leak with the other XPY origin people? The ones you raised a big stink about on gethashing and then suddenly disappeared? 




 How the hell does this not count as a public ommission of guilt that he is trying to skirt regulatory obligation? 




 We have. Garza is being investigated by the SEC, IRS, and several other agencies for securities fraud. I can't imagine the moron is trying to launch yet another freaking exchange with this many eyes on him. 




 Hey everyone, I am hoping someone may be able to find this video.

The video was of an African American gentleman who served in the US army during Jim Crowe segregation, before the civil rights act provided protections in public Accommodations.

He discusses how when he went to a new base, one of his first orders of business was trying to find an apartment. The base had several landlords they worked with, and all were keen on his business. Until he showed up. Then suddenly none had any rooms available. He ended up having to find a place well over an hour off base to live.

He continues on about when he had to transfer bases, how hotels would have vacancy signs on, but when he would ask for a room they'd say they forgot to turn the sign off until he left, and then in the rearview he'd see the sign flip back on.

Specifically I need this for an ongoing discussion about human rights and the reason behind protecting classes of people in public accommodations.

Any help identifying the video would be very much appreciated. 




 Hm, I will definitely investigate. I think I need to do a mental paradigm shift from how Splunk works. 




 Hey everyone. First, I am coming from a Splunk background. That's a big driver for why I am curious about hadoop. We are involved with generating massive amount of logs, but the cost to take enough data into splunk and make it useful is absolutely devastating. So, i am interested in looking at hadoop as a possible alternative.

I know that instead of using indexes, hadoop uses HDFS. Can anyone provide some information on how you get data into HDFS?

With splunk, I can configure a forwarder to tail files, listen on ports, etc, and all data is then forwarded into Splunk indexers. Those indexes then process the data based on rules we create, add some metadata, and store them in time series indexes. You can then search against the data.

So, does hadoop have something like forwarders? Would I need to copy logs onto HDFS somehow? I'm just trying to figure out how it works.

I actually was unaware they had made such a plan to go into the PC market. Then again, that would make sense considering how much of semi-old hardware is named off of AT specs, that is a really good point.

I know at the time they had extended into a ton of different markets - phones, point of sale systems, answering machines, typewriters, and more. All to more or less degrees of "seriousness." I had no idea they were such a big player in the PC market.

 When I was dating my ex-fiancee, she had to be taken in to the hospital because of abdominal pain and bleeding. Between blood work, 2 bags of saline, a doctor shoving his fingers up her ass, and 3 hours in the ER her bill came to over $15k. She wasn't admitted to the hospital either. 




 Interestingly almost no drug test gives accurate results for the presence of a drug. They dont actually test for the drug - they test for metabolites of the drug (the leftover chemicals after the drug has been metabolized). You could smoke pot, be high, and take a test a few minutes later and show as clean. It would take several hours for metabolites to show up in a meaningful way.

This is important because chemical analogs could pitentially produce the same metabolites,  meaning you vould fail a screening necause you ingested something chemically similar.

 Wave really was useful under the right conditions. I remember having 10 people similtaneously editing a single document - a plan for a large camping trip. Everyone was able to edit everything and add stuff on to lists,  claim responsibility for stuff (I'll bring the cheetos!), delegate tasks (hot Becki will call the campground), etc. We had the whole trip planned in about 45 minutes. It never could have been done that fast trying to coordinate with other tools available at the time.

The problem is most folks didn't get to have that experience, so I think it kinda floundered. The nice thing is, they spooned the code into google drive.  If you have multiple editors on a single document, you can use it just like you used wave. So the spirit lives on. 




 I made money selling invites on ebay. Much beer and pot was had. 




 But the thing is, personal computing wasn't their primary sector, and it still isn't. They did dabble, but ultimately refocused because it wasnt in line with their core business. Their name says it all: International Business Machines.

Microsoft doesn't really produce hardware, while IBM does. A better company to compare IBM to would be Cray. Except IBM does way more in the way of r d and integration services. They're a veritable patent factory. 




 Yeah, I get what you are saying but its also important to remember that IBM is massive, and has many lines of business.

Losing out to MS on personal computing is like saying GE lost to Sylvania. Sure, maybe in one market, light bulbs, but overall that was one product line of thousands. 




 Honestly it would be awesome if your dad could do an AMA. I would love to know more about watson under the skirt. What powers it...him...? Is it some crazy heavy metal mainframes like ibm produces? Is it hundreds of mainframes? Just a ton of commodity pizza box hardware? How much memory does Watson have? How is data stored? What sort of algo does it use for storing and retrieving, and for semantic processing? Is it map reduce with some special sauce? Stuff like that.

I'm a telecom r d engineer - IBM would be a dream job for me if only for the truly cool things they build. 




 IBM hasn't really competed with microsoft since OS/2. They are in largely different sectors.

 Usually I approach a new piece like this:

First, play through ignoring pretty much anything related to dynamics, just trying to see where my hand/fingers need to be, sticking roughly to note durations. I don't use a metronome for this.

Second, I start approaching the piece from the beginning with a metronome, usually around 30bpm, and start slowly working through it until I can mostly play it. 

Next, I play through and focus on every spot I seem to have an issue with transitions, places where I can't get my hand to the right spot, etc. I mark off passages I have a hard time with (usually the book looks like graphite exploded all over it at this point).

I drill on those sections one at a time, trying to tighten them up or seeing if there is a different way to play them, and then incorporate them back into the piece. Usually I'll either start by playing the same line over and over until I can play through smoothly.

The problem is, there are still some rough edges at this point when the piece is played altogether.

At this point, my teacher usually requests me to start focusing on musicality.

That's the process... also I try to jump back and forth between 2-3 pieces at any given time so I don't get bored when I'm practicing and start to lose focus. Usually I max out at 2-3 playthroughs of a particular piece (about 5-10 minutes) before I switch to another of the pieces. 




 In the Parkening book, I'm currently working on Greensleeves and some of the more technical exercises. While I can play the piece, I find that, like I said, I am having a lot of buzzing/muted strings when I shouldn't.

Another example is Allegro from Giuliani - I can play clearly except for the the notes where the 3rd and 4th finger are used on the fret hand - I can focus on placing them perfectly, but it slows me down considerably. Otherwise I can get them "more or less" right but tonality suffers. This piece I have mostly mastered though, it's not as bad as greensleeves. 

I've been using Pumping Nylon mostly for the finger exercises (ascending slurs, descending slurs, finger strength and independence builders, etc). 




 Yup - I do. I just have clumsy fingers which don't do me any favors. I usually start abysmally slow (sub 30bpm) and progress from there. I still have issues getting everything clear. But much below that and I can't really keep track of the beat easily. 




 I adore my Kremona. They cost less than spanish classical guitars, but have a sound easily comparable to a higher end Spanish classical. 




 Hey everyone. I have been playing sincr june of last year, so maybe I am getting ahead of myself. However I still notice a lot of buzzes, or inadvertently muted strings.

I've talked with my teacher and he said that right now it's more important to explore a variety of different exercises than it is to get things perfect.

Still, the buzzes/twangs/muted notes annoy me because I know they don't sound right, which usually leads me to pause my playing and correct my fingering. This has caused a nasty habit of stopping what I'm doing instead of carrying on the melody. We are working to eliminate that now - with the rational reason being that the ear is more forgiving to a missed note or slight buzz than it is the piece suddenly stopping and starting.

But if I'm not to focus on getting fingerings perfect now, how can I work to ensure that I'm not building muscle memory with the incorrect fingerings? How can I still keep focusing on progressing while still also keeping a mind to improving my fingering?

I'm working through the parkening method, and also the Pumping Nylon technique book. 




 Or Filipino.  Or really anywhere from the Pacific islands 




 Can you provide a verifiable source that he actually manipulated data? The only claim I've heard was a meta-analysis of his work that most news sites orgs misinterpreted as showing Milgram doctored results when that's not really what the study showed at all.

 I think you're missing my main point.

In OP's case, he didn't see an issue for months, came back to damage, but the damage had been ongoing for months.

In my case, the issue was hidden (floor tile covered the damage) and damage built over a few months, until we saw damage after chipping a tile).

In both cases, damage built up over time and wasn't noticed by the owner.

I get what you're saying that insurance companies aren't the catechall for "deferred maintenance" (which is somewhat incorrect because you can be actively maintaining a property and not notice damage if it is occurring to, say, subfloor - you are suggesting that the owner isn't maintaining things when they may be). The point is - OP's insurance company may not help him if the damage has built over time.

 You may also end up paying more for your repair if you do that. Many old/broken parts are sold back to companies like NAPA, advance auto, autozone, national auto, etc for what's called a "core credit." Essentially the parts can be cleaned, milled, and often refurbished to be used again, or melted down and made into something new.

If you ask for the part, the mechanic won't get the core credit on the price they pay for the part, so they'll pay a higher price. That higher price will be passed on to you. In many cases, unless you are the one purchasing a new part, you can't redeem the core for the old part (this helps prevent chop shops from selling stolen parts). So while you may feel more secure the job was done, you will pay a good bit more cash for it.

  This ideology isn't dead, Marxists are still around, and it still perverts into violence against people with **natural born talents** like **intellectuals**, entrepreneurs, and **people born into wealth**

Yeah, no.
Being part of the golden sperm club doesn't make you naturally talented. 
And most intellectuals are able to look at the world around them and see that the best, most stable countries are the ones that have tried to stray from either extreme with a mix of some socialism and capitalism (primarily capitalistic societies with socialist programs to support the poor, provide education, and help the downtrodden). There's a reason so many conservatives lambaste universities as "citadels of liberalism" - because most intellectuals disagree with a lot of what you're saying.

You sound like you've read a bit too much Ayn Rand. 




 When you have lost that much, so brutally, what in the world can really get you down?

Asshole cut you off in traffic? Well, at least he wasn't threading a rope through my hands or bashing my child against a tree.

My income tax bill was higher than expected? Well, it's not like watching my wife be clubbed to death.

The things most people consider to be problems in our neck of the world simply don't compare to the true monsters that are out there. When you've seen those monsters, I think most of the modern world's troubles just... well... they aren't really troubles. 




  Why did an ideology devoted to the very best in us turn out to be so good in unleashing the very worst?

The same reason that religions are so good at slaughtering people. The most dangerous people are the people who are convinced that they are working for good. 




 It's also appropriate to be vigilant about people who seem eager to kill or to excuse collateral damage. 




 Dinner. 




 This is something I always think about - we refer to ourselves as exceptionally violent, but if you watch most animals in their social structures, they are plenty violent. 2 million ants and termites fighting and killing every survivor of the other side for example. Domestic cats kill trillions a year.

We do have the market cornered on doing it in an organized, systematic fashion, though. 




 Not really. Give those people an authority figure and a sense that they'll be punished if they don't listen, and people are often more than happy to kill. Look up the Milgram experiments. Human beings are brutal creatures. 




 Yup, I meant units and not options.

Now I'm wondering if this is a yearly thing, or a one time grant. I suppose that's a question for my boss. 




 Ok, that makes sense!

I think I'm starting to understand a bit more now. From what I am gathering about the restricted grant, that is essentially stock shares I am given but according to a vesting schedule.

I think I'm understanding now. Thank you!! 




 So, it is less income, and more a guaranteed discount on the price of the stock shares? In fact, I'd have to have the money on hand to purchase the shares if I wanted to use the options? 




 At my yearly review, my supervisor was surprised to see that I was the only one on my team not receiving stock options. He said he would see what he could do about that.

Today I logged in to fidelity and see two new account types that have been added - restricted stock options, and a "stock option plan".

The restricted stock options look like they are full shares that just have a vesting schedule over the next 5 years.

The stock options though, those I don't understand. The account shows a zero balance. BUT it shows a "NSO" type grant, with a grant price a few dollars above the current stock price. It says there are N unvested options, and N total options (N is the same number). It also shows an expiration date 10 years from now.

Can anyone help explain what this means? I've never had stock options before and I'm kind of confused, specifically about the second item. Also, how are these guys taxed? I'm pretty good with finances and investing but this one is new to me. 




 Will this help him? I know most insurance will only help with acute problems (we had a pipe burst), and not build-up problems (slow leak led to damage over the course of a few months). I say this because we recently had to gut a bathroom after finding out there was a small leak doing damage over time that had all but rotted out a floor. The insurance company wouldn't help. 




 I was surprised that the install on the macbook was pretty painless. Basically it fired up an open source driver, and then gave me the option to install the restricted ATI driver, and boom. Worked without any fuss. I'm glad to hear that things continue to improve. Has any movement been made on supporting more wireless chipsets?

As of last year I know it was still a bear for a lot of broadcom chipsets, and even when you could get them to work the signal reception was terrible compared to the same device in windows.

I don't mind linux on a desktop, but, I still just feel like I'm more comfortable with it using a command line. Maybe I'm nostalgic for the old red hat apollo days (been using linux for almost 20 years now, sheesh).

I tend to be a pragmatist about OS's :) 




 Honestly, it was probably in 2008-2010. What thrashed it was doing a system update on ubuntu (I had been running compiz fusion). It royally jacked up the system and I just couldn't get it back. But it left such a bad taste in my mouth after fighting to get that ATI card running.

Eventually I made the switch over to mac hardware, probably in... 2012 maybe? I tri-boot OSX, windows, and ubuntu. And I will say that the graphics management in ubuntu has **markedly** improved, but hardware compatibility is still a bit of a pain sometimes (especially on mac hardware). Fan control is a bit of an issue (it's either off or full blast), and backlighting can all be temperamental. I find i can work just as efficiently in OSX with some tweaks as I can in linux. Especially with brew.

I boot into my ubuntu partition maybe once every few months.. I really should just nuke it and reclaim the space.

I have about 2000 RHEL boxes at work so I get plenty of linux exposure there, lol. 




 Just remember how much libraries have helped you the next time your local legislators try to cut their funding.

 Awesome! Glad I could help! I was a vegetarian for about 8 years, but got lured back in by bacon, fish and hot dogs :) The upside is I have no issue with tofu.

One thing I would recommend - after you sear the pineapple, sprinkle with a big pinch of kosher salt and cover with some aluminum foil (do NOT do this if you have it on a metal pan or plate). The salt really makes the pineapple pop. 




 Hey everyone. Today I made peanut butter eggs for the upcoming holiday. We had a decent amount of leftover chocolate and I happened to have a lego brick mold, so I figured what the heck. This photoset shows the rest:
http://imgur.com/a/ZNUFk

My question though, is about this photo:
http://i.imgur.com/r3Y0pCG.jpg

What are those marks from? The chocolate was tempered with shortening, and it seems like even though it was completely incorporated with the chocolate, it managed to resolidify in some spots. Additionally, along the side of the mold I have several streaks, as if the chocolate was extremely old.

What caused this? How can I avoid it in the future? This is the first time I've used a mold to make chocolate so I'm unsure what I did incorrectly. The mold was buttered, and then had the hot chocolate poured in. 




 There are a ton of really good thickeners, and the key is knowing when to use each one. I prefer arrowroot to cornstarch as far as starch-based thickeners.

Gelatin is also very good. Rouxs have already been covered above.

The final one is a personal favorite - reductions. While not as great at thickening, they are FANTASTIC at intensifying flavors in a way that no other thickener can. 




 It works very well, just make sure to use a very mild cheese (hence farmer cheese). Anything strongly flavored would throw it off. 




 Not a web dev, but a telecom engineer.

The reason I use OSX is because, while I love linux, I feel that it shines the most in a server rack, with a minimal install, where I can configure it to be an appliance that I know will be rocksteady into the future.

Trying to use it on a desktop is problematic. You configure it exactly as you desire, and then suddenly a new update thrashes your X config and suddenly you cant get a window manager to run, even in bulletproof mode. Some piece of hardware requires a hacky workaround to function (which is in itself a problem), and suddenly an update fixes the hacky workaround so the hardware is useless.

I used linux as a primary desktop os for 3 years, and it was a constant source of frustration for me. The above items were real problems, and the community couldn't help. So, when I switched to OSX,  it was great to know it had a BSD pedigree. A few choice apps/scripts like totalterminal in visor mode, and brew, and oh my ZSH, an updated python and perl install, and I had everything I wanted from linux but with excellent support. Or at least a guarantee that updates wouldn't suddenly lock me into a TUI mode.

That's not to say OSX doesn't have issues - it totally does. If you have a weird system problem that is very complex, good luck. Intelligent support is hard to find. The "geniuses" are a joke when you start trying to discuss deep system related problems. Most of them seem unable to do much more than look smug, sell, and wear skinny jeans. It also lacks features I'd love to see from *Nix (the proc filesystem for example).

All OS's are good. Some are just better at some stuff than others. 




 LOL, I kinda wanted to throw on some hot dogs just for profiling purposes. We have a ton of tofu in the freezer that we need to use, so I figured I would grill it. Next in the pipeline is a 13lb pork loin :) 




 Peanut butter eggs, chocolate legos, and some chocolate granola bark! 









 We have a bunch of tofu on hand, so I decided some grilled bbq tofu sandwiches with grilled pineapple on onion rolls were a nice way to go. Yum. 









 I'm pretty sure that the us code's definition of public accomodations prevents descrimination for any currently defined protected class, I don't think it has to be specifically listed. Again, I could be wrong :) IANAL! 




 Yeah! Glad you like... i was just thinking if two couples come in to your bakery, each asks for a cake that says "Congratulations Steve and Terry!" - the only difference between the gay and straight couple is the sex of Terry. That's our variable. And it is an established protected class.

 https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12181 is what public accomodations are.

I believe sex was one of the covered classes under the civil rights act of 1964, and further defined under the equal pay act, but let me doublecheck. 




 I would argue that it is a direct violation of federal law, as most of those companies are considered public accomodations, and their decision is being made based on the sex of one of the customers (and while sexuality isn't a protected class, sex IS).

Essentially, if I want to buy a cake and they would sell me one if my partner is a woman but not if my partner is a man, they are essentially discriminating based on sex of the person that I am with. If it is a business we are patronizing together, they are then directly discriminating against us based on sex. 




 Care to provide case law that a religion requires more than one follower? 




 Even easier: "This just in, Gencon has been disbanded. All assets and management have been purchased and hired by a new company, Jencon."

Oh sorry, that contract was with Gencon which is now defunct. So sorry. 




 Honestly, any politician dumb enough to sign this bill into law doesn't deserve to be president. The utter lack of foresight to think "Hm, I wonder if this will have a backlash that could make me unelectable" alone means he doesn't have what it takes to be POTUS. 




 Sort of. There's a lot of folks who simply can't vote because we're the only farking industrialized nation where election days aren't holidays. It is still quite easy for a boss to come in and tell his low-wage workers "yeah, I need you to come in and leave after polls close."

 While he has no problem poking fun at living people and putting them in farsical situations, I don't see him doing that. Likewise I don't think Mercury's family would let his life to be made into a farce.

So far the most serious roles I've seen him in was as the innkeeper in Les Miserables, Hugo, and Sweeney Todd. I think he can handle it. 




  Men are better than women at basically everything.

Everything includes more than physical.

FTA:

 Counting standard deviations--the measurement of difference between sets of data--she shows how even the widest psychological differences, like physical aggression (0.60 standard deviations, leaning toward men) aren't as much as you might expect. Less than 0.10 standard deviations or between 0.11 and 0.35 standard deviations was common, and those are both defined as small differences. She also measured motor behaviors in boys and girls ages 3 to 20 to get a sense of the difference. Some of those, like grip strength (0.66, toward the gentlemen again), were large compared to the rest of the data, but still small to moderate overall. Throwing velocity and throwing distance? Both blowouts, at 2.18 and 1.98 standard deviations, respectively. Well above anything else, psychological or physical. 

If you read the base article as well, the physical differences are actually not that big. Throwing is a major standout.

 Interestingly, thats not true. There are rather few distinct places where we are different in performance.  Surprisingly, women throw weaker than men. Beyond that, not too many differences.

There are a ton more issues... accents, local jargon, professional words and jargon, people who speak other languages, telling one speaker from another, etc. It has come a long way over the past 20 years, but I think it could easily be 10 before really servicable, maybe 5 if the datamining stuff like siri and echo pays off 




 You know, now I want to start infecting USB drives with rootkits and shipping them back and forth internationally to see if any blips show up. 




 One thing I am pondering. Mycelium is also a young growth stage for fungi, including "magic mushrooms."  While mushroom spores are legal to ship, mycelium cultures are not.

I wonder if there is some sort of confusion going on? It's a stretch, but maybe. 




 I actually do know people who hate texas, but the majority have moved out. Thats probably part of the issue. Visit Austin if you get the chance, you'll meet a lot more people who are less proud of Texas.

But as for the personality of texans, there is a show on Netflix called "the shapes of our states" or something like that. They have an excellent episode on Texas. In general most Texans think of themselves as Texans first and Americans second.  




 The problem is the same as the US, which is why I'm drawing the parallel. The sense of exceptionalism, with a healthy dose of whitewashing history. 
























 Well, being debt free, plus freeing up cash flow for other uses, namely further investments (we want to purchase a vacation house) and opening a 529. Getting back that 1300 a month is equivalent to us getting an extra paycheck each month. 




 This is where we are currently leaning. 

I have considered pausing the investing, but my portfolio has significantly outperformed my interest rates the past few years so I am slightly hesitant to do so. Still, getting the loan paid off sooner than later is a good thing. 




 ...why? 









 Yup - it was a keybank alternative loan received during 2002-2007, which was then sold off to great lakes. They're bound to some index (sadly their website changed and I can't find the exact terms) but it is capped at 3.5%. 




 Hey everyone.

Yearly, my wife and I bring in the following (gross):

* Me: $81k/yr
* Wife: $65k/yr

My wife and I have two outstanding debts:

* A home mortgage with $154k remaining at 4.125% (fixed), minimum payment of $1380/mo. We are focusing on this loan, and are paying an extra $700/mo on it
* A private student loan with $51k remaining at 3.170% (variable but capped at 3.5%) with minimum payment of $557/mo

Given the relatively low interest rates on each, I have also been investing.

* $70/mo into VPAIX (we are over the 25% tax level)
* $230/mo split across a diversified investment portfolio (EWX, PID, SCHA, SCHM, VNQ, VONV, VOOG)
* ~$200/mo into a company ESPP (15% discount off ticker price of first or last day of fiscal quarter, whichever is lower)
* $28/mo into I-series treasury bonds (don't laugh :) )

I am not including 401k/403b/pension payments here. We both are contributing the max matched amount our employers allow, and I add about $150 extra a month to a roth 401k.

So, my real question is, given the amounts we are contributing, loan payoff calculators show an estimated debt-free date of Oct 2022 using Avalanche, with $31k total interest. Using snowball, I AGAIN see Oct 2022 but with $32k of total interest. Other than ~$1k interest, the only real difference is that with snowball I get back the additional $557/mo from the smaller loan by the end of 2018. Having the extra cashflow every month would be useful. That would be nice, especially since the wife and I are starting to discuss kids and by that time we'd be looking at daycare costs, clothing, etc. The cashflow would be nice - nice enough that I think I'd be willing to pay the extra 1k/mo for flexibility. Getting rid of investing entirely in the meantime would at best change the "debt free" date by approximately 1 year.

Note that this does not include any windfalls; tax returns usually are around $6k/yr for us (this should shrink as interest goes down), I get a yearly bonus of about $4k, etc, so the date will likely be sooner. Usually this all gets pointed at loans or large purchases (if we have them). It also does not include yearly cost of living wage increases. Any wage increase we get we have been directing at paying off loans.

I just want to get some feedback from other folks about how they'd handle this situation. Given the possibility of a kid in the next year or two, is it better to eat the extra ~$1k of interest and go for a snowball approach and free up that student loan cash flow in 2-3 years? $557/mo is about 5/8ths of the cost of daycare in our area. Or should I let the math guide me and stick with an avalanche approach and not get back ANY additional cashflow until the early 2020s? 




 My personal favorite is french onion soup. Grab a bag of onions, slice thin, sweat covered with butter for about 20 mins (looking for soft), add some salt and sugar and  turn up heat to medium/medium high. Brown the onions until they are a dark brown, stirring frequently. Add 6 cups beef stock (or 4 cups beef and 2 chicken) along with 1 cup of a sweet wine (I use cream sherry).

Serve over toasts that have been topped with a good melting cheese.

Delicious, and most importantly cheap to make.

 Hello everyone! I am looking to build a hydroponics system inexpensively. I am completely new to this, but I want to teach myself and building from scratch is usually the best way I learn.

Flourescent lights (cheaper than LED and last just about as long) in 6500k and 2000-3000k colors

Nutrients (obviously)

Essential design would be the same shown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brvJ2fGXusU, with one unit for each of 2-3 shelves. One shelf would be under each color of light, with another light and setup on the 3rd shelf for mother plants.

Goal is to have several types of lettuce, herbs, some trainable heirloom tomatoes, peppers, Acmella oleracea (toothache plant), and maybe some kind of fruit. The plan would be to take clones from mother plants and plant under the vegetative lights for a bit (or permanently in the case of herbs and lettuces), and then transition to bloom for the flowers/fruiting plants. 

Is there anything I can do better with this design? I would love to go with LEDs but the cost is absurdly high. Eventually I would love to hook this up to a solar system so it can be powered entirely off the grid. 




 I have it allocated elsewhere as well - the bond fund makes up about 14% of my 401k portfolio. To my knowledge it is the only fee.... checking the prospectus the fee schedule is 0.0446% 




 Hey everyone. This bond fund is the only bond fund made available in my 401k program. However, there is a quarterly "recordkeeping fee" that is applied, and I'm seriously concerned about what that fee will add up to over time.

This fee has doubled from 4 dollars a quarter to 8 dollars a quarter, and I have a total of 7k invested. That means i'm losing about .4% to fees every year. My yearly performance is somewhere in the 1.6% ROI, so that seems like I'm losing a LOT and not getting bang for my buck to keep up with it.

Is anyone familiar with this fund? Is it a garbage product like it seems? 




 Well, my best advice in the meantime is start programming in your free time. You have a computer, and there is a ton of free info out there (Stanford, MIT, and more all have free courses). So try it out. If you have an iPhone or an android phone, try writing an app you think would be useful. Teach yourself.

Hunting down information and methods for doing things is something you'll have to do regularly in programming, so doing it yourself before you're in school is a great way to build those skills.

The reason this is important is if you plan to get a job programming, a lot of places will expect examples of work you've done. From simple stuff like utilities you write to big projects. If you want to work for yourself instead, you need to be the one driving yourself to be at the keyboard programming. 




 FYI, being a super-power-user doesn't equate to being good at computer science, or enjoying it. Do you like puzzles? Specifically logic puzzles? How good are you at breaking down complicated processes into simple steps? How good are you at math? How much do you enjoy doing these things? Enough to do it every day for 12-14 hours a day or more? Since you have a developer dad and spend that much time on computers, have you done any programming?

I'm not trying to dissuade you, I'm someone who was in your position at one point, and I want you to go into a field you're going to be happy with. Programming is not easy, and if you don't have the bug you will burn out.

I started out in computer science, but ended up spending all of my time working on fixing computer issues. Eventually I started to specialize in systems and network engineering, virtualization, linux, and data analytics. It's given me a great career.

Basically, don't think that just because you are on your computer 100% of the time you'll be an amazing programmer or computer scientist. But if computers are where your passion is, don't let that limit you. There's lots of ways to use technology as a career. 




 PLUS most stores will have items reduced for quick sale early in the morning (specifically meat and veggies which will get snatched up fast). 




 Never missed a payment on anything except twice when it was bank error. I've had credit history since I was 16 - my parents got me a cosigned credit card with a $400 limit. I've paid off several credit cards stacks of credit card debt, paid off several car and student loans, now I regularly use credit cards but pay them off monthly. My total debt is a private student loan which is about 5/8ths of what I make in a year, well under my actual assets (not sure if that is counted in FICO or not). Beyond that, I can't think of anything else that I've done.

Our mortgage is in my wife's name - she bought it before we were married and the process to have my name added is a PITA - so I doubt that that factors in to my FICO score.

Only other thing I can think of is that I took out a private loan from a friend to pay off my credit card debt that I had accumulated with high interest cards while i was in college. So that may have been something? Though that is older than 7 years ago at this point. 




 Yeah.. i'm thinking I may take note of the places I frequent the most and verify they take it. If I can cover at least 50% of my usual haunts it may be worthwhile. 




 That is AWESOME! Thank you for the heads up. I had no idea about the purchase guarantee... that alone would be worthwhile for big purchases! 




 Really close to it. I can recall two missed payments, both problems caused by the bank (one was ID theft related, the other was when a credit card number got stolen and used, so the card was shut down and an automatic payment got missed).

My family was terrible with money growing up, so it was a sterling example of what not to do. I also had a lot of promises broken, so when I sign a promissory note it really bothers me to break that promise. Not that I haven't had my share of debts until I figured my stuff out, I just went without to ensure everything always got paid. 




 True, but they are paying fees to the bank, and then the bank pays that to me. Still, a good distinction to make. 




 I know! I currently have 1 card that does 5% back, but only on fuel purchases, and 3% back on food/groceries, and .5% on everything else (Pentagon federal credit union platinum rewards card). 




 Well, not so much mistaken as out of date :) It was an old promo that I've been sitting on for awhile. Sadly it looks like the offer has changed since then. 




 Yeah - it was a very old email I had been sitting on, but it appears the card's terms have changed. They offered 5% back on the amex and 2% back on a VISA, but it appears that the Amex is now only 2% and I can't find the VISA at all. 




 Interesting - you're right. They used to offer an Amex at 5%, and a visa at 1.5-2%, but it looks like the Amex is now only 2% and i can't find the visa at all. I guess I waited too long :( 




 Barclays Bank of Delaware offers free FICO credit scores for credit card customers. Not sure which algo they use though. I just checked in - currently shows a score of 830. 




 Simple - cash back cards give me a 3-5% discount on everything I buy. Or should I pay 3-5% more on everything I buy? 




 Hey everyone. I have been offered an American Express card that offers ~~5~~2% directly deposited into my fidelity money market account. There are no fees, and no minimum spends required. I have two other credit cards atm, one is used mostly for gas, the other used mostly for work expenses or unforseen expenses until I can transfer money from my emergency fund. Both are paid off monthly like clockwork.

Those of you who have amex cards, how useful are they? I know in my area many vendors don't accept amex because of higher fees, but it would be wonderful to have the extra cash for investing. How many or few vendors accept it? Has it been an issue when trying to use the card?

EDIT: Looks like the 5% is a very old offer, the card is now 2% cash back directly into my fidelity account. 




  The Dave Ramsey people would suggest that a "good" fico score means you are well on your way to becoming a lifetime slave to the bank.

I'd have to argue that "good" FICO scores mean that you know how to handle credit responsibly as a tool. Depending which FICO score, mine ranges from 820 to 889. 

I use credit cards for everything, but pay them back at the end of the month in their entirety, enjoying the nice 3-5% cash back that they give me. It effectively is like having a coupon everywhere. I am hardly a "slave to the bank" - rather I am the one getting the bank to pay me.

I've discussed this with Dave Ramsey people and they act like even owning a credit card is the most horrendous thing you can do. The man has many good points, I just wish that some of the folks weren't so dogmatic about what he teaches. They're missing the forest for the trees. Credit cards, loans, mortgages, they're all tools that you can use, you just have to know to use them wisely. 




 Marry me? 




 I have a psych degree, and I am employed as an engineer. I get specialized skills AND bouncy balls! 




 First, /u/alexinawe has excellent advice. I highly recommend you check out the book "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham. There is a reason Warren Buffet considers it the bible of investing.

So for your question, what I mean is that shares of stock aren't actually related to the company. I'll do my best to explain (and any corrections from more experienced investors are welcome). I've tried to keep things simple by excluding stuff like order books because they'd just muddy the waters.

Suppose you have Company X, and they are going public. They partner with an investment bank and together they calculate a valuation for the company, let's say $10m. They then determine how many shares should be issued, and what price point they should be sold at initially, let's say 1m shares at $10. The company and the investment bank claim a portion of shares for themselves at a particular price, let's say $1, and also to make good on things like contractual distributions of those shares of stock (these are often referred to as founder shares). This all happens before the IPO, and there are often some restrictions on people within the company to prevent selloffs. Let's say the company claims 500k shares for itself at a cost of $500k.

When the IPO is kicked off, those shares of stock are sold to investors by the investment bank, **not the company itself**, on to the open market starting at the determined IPO price ($10). So, they make money on the difference between the founder price and the IPO price (so, $9 difference times 500k is $4.5m). Then the price will rapidly move higher or lower depending on what the market thinks the shares *should* be worth based on company fundamentals, emotion, whatever. If you buy during that IPO, you are buying the stock from the bank, NOT the company issuing the IPO. If you buy after the IPO, you are buying from another investor, NOT the company issuing the IPO. The company doesn't really have to do anything with the market unless they decide to issue more shares, issue dividends, merge/split, sell shares, or they perform a buyback.

The shares themselves are essentially a pile of chits created by the investment bank and the company. The shares exist outside of the company, the company just happens to own some number of them after paying a bargain price. You can see how much of the stock is owned by the company itself by opening yahoo finance or google finance and seeing how much is institutionally owned.

So, how does the company make money from the IPO? Suppose the market determines that the shares should be worth $50 each instead of $10. When someone buys or sells a share of that stock, the company doesn't see any money from the sale. What they DO see though, is that those initial 500k shares of stock that they reserved are now worth $25m total instead of the $500k that was originally spent for them. THIS is the part that is often misconstrued. When you buy shares of stock, none of that money goes to the company. The only way it really benefits the company is by driving the price of shares a miniscule amount higher (because you've increased demand and decreased the supply on market), which means their shares are now worth a tiny bit more.

This is why things like stock buybacks work. Let's suppose company X has had a great year after their IPO, and their stock is in high demand. They issue a stock buyback for 100k shares (total cost at market value would be 5m, so they are at $20m). The demand hasn't yet changed on shares of their stock, but there are 100k fewer on the market. So the rules of supply and demand dictate that when supply shrinks but demand stays the same, prices will go up. So, the market price goes up to, lets say 60$. Now, because the company owns 600k shares valued at $60 each, the company now has $36m in assets. In addition, share prices have gone up for everyone else who is invested in the company too, so they make a profit as well because of the buyback.

I hope that all makes sense. 




 There are some vehicles that offer that return safely, but they're usually closed end funds and can be a bit of a PITA to evaluate. I am aware of one that offers a 10% annual dividend yield, with monthly payouts. They make their money by options trading on natural resource stocks and bonds. They're not doing great atm because natural resource exploration and mining are down across the board so there's less chance for them to make a profit.

It takes hunting, but you can find them. 




 Not understanding that buying a stock is NOT buying "part of a company" despite what your high school economics teacher told you. 




 There are old mushroom hunters, and bold mushroom hunters. There are no old bold mushroom hunters.
 




 Do all of those police pay into the same union that then funds legal defenses and contributes to political warchests to help ensure their buddies are in power? Yup. They do. 

In fact, find me one record of a police officer refusing to pay union dues until union leaders stop interfering with due process. Remember when they provided a ton of expert testimony to prove that because Eric Garner's head was turned *just a little too far* so it wasn't "technically" a chokehold that kicked off the horriffic events that were to follow and the officer "technically" didn't break official departmental rulings against using chokeholds? Remember when the police union in NY threatened the city with a slowdown in policing - effectively holding the city hostage? Show me ONE example of a cop standing up against this BS. I bet you can't. Find me ONE COP who has stood up and said "fuck this grand jury bullshit, if the guy is innocent, let it be proven in trial."

So instead of all being bad cops, some are bad cops and the rest are bad cop supporters.  




 [Viola?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola) 




 Sadly they're already leggy (had them next to a southern facing window for a few days until I could get the lamps installed where I needed them). Hopefully they aren't screwed up too bad. Right now I have the light about 1 inch from the tops of the tallest seedlings.

I'll be picking up some 6500k lights this evening to replace what is currently there (4000k cool white lights) 




 Hey everyone. I am in the process of setting up a dedicated plant growing area in my home. I have two goals: first, a dedicated area for starting seeds to be planted in our large outdoor garden, and second, I want to begin growing a plant called "toothache plant" because I feel there is a viable business opportunity.

My big concern is that over the past few years, there are several examples where no-knock warrants are executed because grow-lights are seen using thermal imaging, and in the process people, pets, and more have been shot or killed. This is what I want to avoid.

How can I best avoid this? I don't have anything to hide, but I am genuinely concerned about the well-being of my wife, my dog, and my house. Can I call the police department and invite them for a walkthrough? 




 If you dont play the games, read the books. Geralt is a badass.

Even if you do... read the books anyway. 




 Hey everyone. I have two trays of seedlings started. I moved them under grow lights today (running behind a bit because I had to hunt down a new fluorescent tube). This is my first time using indoor grow lights to get things started.

What light cycle should they be on? 24 hours? 18 on 6 off? 12 on 12 off? Any help would be appreciated! 




 Not quite. Athenian democracy had some pretty powerful tools for the body politic. If your representative (chosen at random from all eligible voters) failed to perform their duties, they could be punished - up to and including death.

It wasn't until the 30 tyrants period that their political system really got screwed up. 




 I though small claims court had a much lower limit than 3k? 




 That said - $3k is likely not enough money to make it worthwhile to go to court. I'd be amazed to see an attorney charge less than that for even 1 day in court plus prep. 




 I heard their periods attract bears! 




 Not all colonials had the same opinions - don't group them all together. [Only about 30% of colonials wanted to leave the empire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalists_fighting_in_the_American_Revolution#The_Loyalists)

And rioting before the revolutionary war began in 1765 with the stamp act, and then later the townshends act of 1767, and finally the coercive act of 1774. All of these saw large amounts of rioting AND looting - enough that impromptu neighborhood watch groups formed out of local artisans and businessmen to try and calm the situation (as mentioned in the below link, Philadelphia saw a group called the "White Oaks" formed).

[The sons of liberty excelled at rallying the angry rioters and using them as a weapon.](https://books.google.com/books?id=QqvIvErLiecC pg=PA40 dq=sons+of+liberty+rioting+looting hl=en sa=X ei=Ut0_VcP9MoLlsASnhYCoAw ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage q=sons%20of%20liberty%20rioting%20looting f=false) 




 Looting happened frequently following the riots of the stamp act. So much so that groups of merchants banded together to police the streets (a group known as the White Oaks). Acting like the only people who rioted were doing so out of noble intentions is historically inaccurate. [The sons of liberty actively cajoled groups of rioters and looters as a means of coercion](https://books.google.com/books?id=QqvIvErLiecC pg=PA40 lpg=PA40 dq=sons+of+liberty+rioting source=bl ots=Jk7fVmTCKV sig=Rqd6O55evoEXLICVVkxjAyqTSZ0 hl=en sa=X ei=PNU_VaytKYiwggSh24HgCA ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage q=sons%20of%20liberty%20rioting f=false). 




 Where exactly did I defend rioting? 




 It's not in that article, I found it after poking around a bit more. Franklin was an emissary to the crown, so protestors threatened to burn his house down and lynch his wife because not only did Franklin passively approve the stamp tax, but he was petitioning the crown to become a stamp distributor.

http://allthingsliberty.com/2014/02/the-hated-benjamin-franklin/

 "In 1765, the British government, in an effort to raise money to pay off its war debts, imposed the Stamp Act on the American colonists, forcing them to pay a tax on each paper item they used. On September 17, 1765, a number of Philadelphia citizens threatened to attack Deborah Franklin's house, protesting that her politician husband had not fought against the Stamp Act vigorously enough." 

http://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2008/10/deborah-read-franklin.html 




 I have to disagree about it being a major reach.

* In both groups, people rioted, attacked agents of the government, and destroyed private property. They even went so far as to target particular people (SoL attacked loyalists, tax collectors, and local magistrates, current protestors are attacking police).
* In both groups, the protests that led to violence were to protest helplessness at enacting social change to benefit the governed. The colonists couldn't stop taxes, minorities can't stop police from getting special treatment when murdering someone (up to and including DA's doing the exact opposite of their job by acting as defense attorneys in front of grand juries to prevent indictments).
* In both groups, there was not yet a formal declaration of war dividing them (so trying to excuse the actions of the SoL as part of war is invalid as the declaration of independence didn't exist until at least 1773, and wasn't ratified until 1776).
* We hold one group as heroic patriots for destroying property, and lynching officials, while decrying the other as criminals

I don't see it as being that much of a reach. At the very least, there is a strong enough connection that we can discuss why we consider some rioters heroes for rioting against what they perceive as injustice, while contemporary rioters are written off as criminals. 









 IANAL however it becomes very muddy when a state of emergency is declared 




 Interesting - in some parts of the US a smorgasbord is another term for a large buffet. I had no idea it was originally a sandwich table! 




 Thanks for the video link! 




 So THATs where root beer came from ;) 




 Our town had a free tree giveaway to celebrate spring, and my wife snagged me a baby crabapple tree.

It is still tiny, so I was planning on putting it in some potting soil in a small cup to get settled in, and then moving that into a larger pot with some airy fertilized soil. Once it gets to be a foot taller, I may plant it outside (we are in 6b, and apparently this cultivar is good to zone 7).

Is there anything else I need to be aware of?? Is this a solid plan?? It came with instructions but they instruct to plant right into soil. The issue is that we aren't past our final frost date yet. 









 If you have an IOS device, robinhood offers free trades for basic accounts. I think I have some invites if you want one. They are super minimal, but seem to work ok. 




 Which is why I will always be pro-dog. Dogs at least growl to give you some warning. I've had somewhere in the realm of 20 cats, and I have encountered 1 that was not a complete dickhole at least part of the time. 




 Can you point interested parties towards the information that you leaked?

Did it contain information about Haliburton flagrantly ignoring its obligation to fulfill reconstruction contracts in Iraq after the first gulf war, but still pocketing the money?

Also, do your balls of steel clink when you walk? HA! 




 Have you heard of comcast internet essentials? It's even cheaper - 10 dollars a month. And I doubt Comcast would have stopped the plan. Part of approving the Comcast/NBCUniversal deal involved comcast creating a plan to help enable low cost internet access. If anything, canceling the plan would invite regulatory scrutiny. 




 Charter already made an offer on TWC before the comcast attempt at a deal. They lowballed it, and TWC declined. Now that the Comcast deal is going down, they can make a second offer at a higher price.

Source: employee at one of these companies who was doing work directly related to this deal 




 It is possible, but may or may not happen. TWC turned down an offer from Charter already for being too low. We'll see if they'll make a second offer. 




 To my knowledge, she had the abortion. Though believe me, I have had nightmares that she'll suddenly pop up someday and say "by the way, you owe me 17 years of child support, AND I screwed you out of knowing your kid" or some crap like that. While she and her brother are estranged, he never mentioned her having the additional kid from me. The timing would have been off.

My wife knows the full story, and I've braced her for the possibility that it could happen one day. As it stands, I have no way of getting in touch with her one way or the other. She has gone off the grid. 




 Before I start, let me preface by saying I am ok with abortion for other people. However before I enter into a sexual relationship with a woman I make it clear that I don't believe in it for myself. I'll take precautions, but I understand the biology involved and if despite all of that a pregnancy happens, I want to see it carried to term. If she says no, we part ways. Cards are laid out on the table. (I am not looking to debate women's rights)

Anyways, a psychotic ex of mine told me that she had gotten a depo provera shot, and said she didn't like using condoms. So stupid me believed her. She ended up pregnant because she never really got the depo shot. She almost immediately started using the pregnancy as a bargaining chip. Going so far as to say that she'd kill my kid if I didn't do what she wanted several times. That isnt hyperbole - that is how she phrased it.

During our last fight, she said it, then she started mocking me... saying shit like "I'm going to kill your baby, and theres nothing you can do to stop me. How does it feel to be helpless to stop me from killing your kid?" At that point I knew it was over, only my name was on the lease to the apartment, so I told her to get out or I was calling the cops to have her removed. Dumb bitch apparently didnt think that part through and her tune suddenly changed that she was sorry and didn't have anywhere to go. Too late.

She meets up with some guy and leaves (I had had suspicions she was cheating on me after seeing several chat logs while watching her play games - turns out I was right). About a month later I start getting texts from her at the abortion clinic, again saying shit about killing the baby, and how helpless I was to stop her, how she wished she had never met me, etc.

Last I heard she has 4 kids from 4 different guys and has had double digit abortions (still friends with her little brother). She is living on child support checks from all 4 dads, and is shacked up with some other guy. White trash brood mother.

This, boys and girls, is why one does not stick one's dick in crazy. 




 It's not my song. I'm transcribing a Bob Dylan piece from a score. Shelter from the Storm - there are 10 verses, with 9 repeats.

I'm not trying to rewrite someone else's work. 




 Yup! That should work fine! Once you get used to it, you'll find the way that feels the most comfortable to you.

With vaporizers it can be tough to tell. Your lungs will be filling up, so you may feel slightly warm in your chest. If you were smoking you might feel an urge to cough (though this can happen with a vape too). 




 You want your lips around it. Basically all air you are pulling in should be coming through the straw. Make sure it enters your lungs. It can feel a little wierd of you aren't used to it. 




 Can you provide any more information than that? I'm still learning the software so a creative fix may be a long way away. 




 That's not impossible, especially since it sounds like you're a bit of a newbie. Just inhale like you normally would.

Grab a straw. Breathe through it. The feeling you get when you inhale? That's what you want to be doing. Heck, you could keep inhaling through the straw and stick it over the stem of your MFLB if you wanted.

You wouldn't be the first person who had trouble with smoking/vaping the first few times :) 




 Did you tumble the contents around? How charged is your battery? Were you seeing vapor on the glass? 




 If you read the warranty, when you get a replacement unit, the old unit becomes property of Magic-Flight. That's why they have you wreck it (check the text in your manual).

I totally get what you mean, it sucks to get rid of the unit, but otherwise there is no reason people wouldn't just get one, wreck it, get a replacement, wreck it, and so on and then just repair them, you know? Sure they could sue, but only really in the US.

I doubt many people will be checking in on you though. 




 So, if you make this, how the hell do you stop it from combusting? That was a heck of a long draw it seemed. 




 I wish I could do that. Half the time it makes me trembly now, and that would completely throw me off. My tolerance is nowhere near where it was back in college days. 




 You got it. While he did create doge, he also is a bit of a drama queen. 




 Oh look, he's quitting again. I wonder how long that will take for him to come back this time. 




 This is good to know. The wife and I plan to retire/immigrate to either the Netherlands or Belgium when we retire (still 30 years away). It sounds like we'd have to pay for a house in cash rather than use a mortgage when we make the move. 




 This is true. For instance I recently invested in a tax free bond fund for my state, and the minimum buy in was 3k. I'm lucky that I can afford that but it still took a few weeks of saving to scrape together that amount. 




 Pretty simple Q. There seems to be a limit of 8 repeats with an alternate ending. I am trying to transcribe a piece which has 9 repeats for the first alternate ending, and then an additional 2 after for the second alternate ending.

Is this doable? There only seem to be 8 boxes that can be checked. 




 They're listening? So have they provided a support phone number yet? Or are they still telling their customers to post on the forums and piss off if no one helps? 




 The baby can be done fairly cheaply. A friend of mine is a bit of a hippie-dippy type, but she used to give seminars poking holes in the expenses of a baby. A lot banks on everything going "ok" but if you luck out, it isn't that pricey. 

* Instead of formula, breastfeed (supplementing only as necessary). 

* Instead of buying a crib, co-sleep

* Instead of buying disposable diapers, make them out of cloth or buy reusable diapers. 20 seconds of rinsing and then they go into the washing machine.

* When they're old enough to eat baby food, use a food mill and puree whatever mom and dad are eating. This has the upside of forcing mom and dad to eat healthfully.

There were some others she goes over, but she did present the numbers and it was pretty incredible the difference in price. 




 Have to agree with you. I once dated a girl who scored a perfect SAT score, she was valedictorian of her HS, summa cum laude of her college. Utterly brilliant.

In public, she acted like a complete and total glassy-eyed mouth-breathing ditz. In private though, she was brilliant. She said she usually just had to lower the way she talks and acts to what people were comfortable with.

Still, it was a huge turn off every time we'd go out in public and she'd suddenly dumb down. 




 One of the best dad jokes I've read in awhile.

 Honestly, I believe that both exist, and are opposite tendrils of the same beast.

Right now, no, I do not think that surveillance impacts as much as bread and circuses (score one for Huxley?). Not because it doesn't exist, but because it's non-obtrusive.

But at some level, there is some amount of behavior modification that comes from fear of surveillance. After the Snowden leak came about and it was found that Microsoft was piping info to them, Microsoft soon got rid of the "always on" requirement for their xbox kinect on the xbox one because no one wanted an NSA box in their living room. This is a silly example, but I feel a valid one nonetheless. 




 Let's see.

Attempted character assassination: Check

Straw man argument: Check

 just another privileged angsty kid... 1984 is one of the most misunderstood books there is, it's really not meant for your kind.

Orwell was a "privileged angsty kid." Read Down and Out in Paris and London for part of his autobiography. I'm pretty sure you have no idea what you're talking about in terms of who the author intended the book for. It is entertaining to see you make assumptions about who I am, my social station, and more based purely about my opinions of the world.

1984 doesn't have some hidden meaning. The reason everyone gets the same thing out if it is because Orwell was very public about what it represented. [Read his thesis that inspired the book](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/12/george-orwell-s-letter-on-why-he-wrote-1984.html). He wanted people to know about how terrifying totalitarianism was, whether it emerged from fascism, socialism, or even democracy gone awry. This was based on his experience in Burma, and in Spain under Franco. He wanted it to be a cautionary tale, and to tell people that they need to be vigilant to prevent it from happening. Per his letters - "the world moves towards fascism, but it's not irreversible". So yeah, seeing shadows of 1984 and trying to sound the alarm was exactly his goal.

So go on, do tell me more about how you know more about Orwell than Orwell did. 




 Care to have an intelligent conversation, or are you just looking to sling insults? 




 I think some was known, some wasn't. We knew about warrantless wiretapping, however we didn't know about massive instant-messaging recording, or that the NSA had breeched several large technology companies to consume data en masse.

Again, I think both answers are correct. There is absolutely a level of apathy about it a la Huxley, but the shenanigans that Orwell predicted also absolutely do exist as well.

I think the current situation contains both. 




 I'd argue that the two aren't mutually exclusive. 




 I get what you are saying, but several of those things do exist to some level (not as fully implemented in the book, but the shadows are certainly looming large).

As a telecom engineer, I have to disagree on your first point. Google stingray and you'll see what I mean. You can be tracked via gps without a warrant. Not to mention your google search will be logged, cataloged, and sold to the highest bidder (and the government if they ask for it). Though NSA disclosures show the NSA was accessing that data anyway.

As for not disappearing people, have you heard of extraordinary rendition? COUNTELPRO? 

As for kids turning in parents, we aren't there yet. However we are at a place where everyone is watching everyone else thanks to post 9/11 scare mongering. Google Rick Bradshaw's florida program that rewards people financially for reporting neighbors with antiestablishment views (luckily it was vetoed).

Forced exercise - well, beyond gym class, I suppose you are right here. Though with the US military seeing a possibility of troop shortages because so few people can meet fitness requirements and reframing the issue as a national security one, it could be on the horizon.

For language reduction, you are right. Though evidence does support that our vocabilaries are shrinking.

There are other items that are absolutely present.

We absolutely have a 5 minute hate - just turn on the news and listen to who we are supposed to be hating today. The big bad Russians? The Cuban socialists? The Iranians?

As for "war is peace"  the US has been involved in conflict 222 out of its 239 years.

I am not saying that it is 100% identical, but we are far closer than the state of the world he feared than when he wrote it. Orwell himself agreed - and things have only gotten closer since WWII.

 I think its interesting that we see facets of both Brave New World and 1984 in the modern US.

It is distilled but this comic does a good job comparing them (although I ultimately disagree with the final points). In every case, BOTH are present. Not only do people want to ban books, but literacy and science are ridiculed or at the very least ignored by mass media as people go on their search for bread and circuses.

 Observable data are facts. Without facts we have no way to form hypotheses or theories. 




 He may not be allowed to express his personal beliefs if they could upset the waters and risk a lawsuit and bad publicity (even if it is a bluff). Teachers have to walk a very fine line. I'm married to one - she has to censor herself a lot to make sure she never upsets the naive innocent little snowflakes. 




 You will be nervous. It's your first day!

Pick up cues from your colleagues.  Many professional offices have employee handbooks that talk about what is expected of you. Read it.

If you find your nerves get the better of you, bring chamomile tea and pound it like it's water.

Honestly a big office is no different than any other workplace once you get used to it. Don't overthink it. If you have a manager or supervisor, let them know your reservations. Be open and communicative. 




 Honestly? 1984. Namely because the society described is mostly here in essence now in the US, and we let it happen. 




 Not related to 4/20 in any way, lol!

Seriously though, this would be fun to do for the wife and I's anniversary! 




 No, ignoring that there are steps you have to take in a bad police encounter to put chinks in their armor is naive.

Can they be abusive? Yup. But I'd rather have solid evidence on a dashcam that shows my rights being violated in black and white that any defense attorney can use to get the case dropped, and if it isnt, can be used as the basis for an appeal. 




 Honestly, it is. If they say nothing, ask if you are free to go. If not, ask why you are being detained. The important part is you asking.

You get arrested, you call an attorney and contact the ACLU because you have a dead simple case of your rights being violated. Your attorney has the case thrown out, and you sue the municipality for illegal detention. 




 I used to get high like you. I'd hire a bunch of hookers and do lines of weed off their tits. 




 Then you ask them what their reasonable suspicion is for detaining you. 




 I wish. Pot makes me go SQUIRREL! 
BHO on the other hand gives me blinders.

Here you go! The batteries come in a little plastic box that has 2 dividers in it. Should work perfect! 




 I picked up some powerex batteries off amazon and they came in a nice little case. Works great! 




 I wish the tin had enough room for a PA and orbiter :( 




 I ordered mine from vapornation a few days ago with their holiday discount. It won't be arriving til friday. 

I was torn between it and the ufo, but ultimately it seemed like the overall opinion was more in favor of the orbiter.

So if you have an orbiter, How do you like it? Any advice for using it with the box and avoiding stuff like combustion? 




 As I was driving in to work today I was thinking how great a zebrawood or purpleheart mflb would look. I'd love to just be able to send them a wood blank! 




 I had a Pax 1, and between the constant amount of cleaning, lifetime supply of pipe cleaners, the fighting to get the mouthpiece to connect properly, and the weird upset stomach it gave me every time I used it I ended up reselling to a friend. It sounds like the pax2 fixes some if the issues, but according to reviews it adds some new ones. At double the price of an MFLB it just isn't worth it for me.

My MFLB is my goto vape. Almost every issue you are reporting sounds like it could be resolved with a little commitment to learning to use your device properly (not saying you aren't using it right, but the manual taught me a bit after I had already been using it for a year). You shouldn't be combusting a quarter of your trenches - it sounds like you are holding the battery way too long and the whole thing is overheating.

My MFLB is about 2 years old now, still using the original batteries like a champ.

I DO have a backup vape - an arizer solo. I just hate that the solo pulls a ton of crumbs through when I inhale. 




 I had the same thing happen. Tbh I am not a fan of the mflb without a stem. It does work, but not being able to see browning and losing a surprising amount of vapor through the airhole makes it perform way worse than with a stem (from my experience).

Pick up a dart stem, they're awesome albiet a little less stealthy. 




 You shouldn't be combusting.

I don't mean to sound rude, but take a look at your mflb manual. They go into great detail about how to draw.

By hash do you mean BHO or bubble hash? Further, are you using the concentrate trays? 




 Where did you get the netting? Just curious because it looks like it would work wonders for porchetta. 




 Hello everyone. We have our cat's litter box in our laundry room, which is an exterior room. To help prevent heat loss during the winter, we had started keeping the laundry room's door shut as much as possible, but that created a problem with the cat being unable to access the cat box.

So, I installed a bidirectional cat door.

At first, the cat just stood there confused. I poked her head through a few times, so she knows it's not solid. Then I held it open for her and she went through. Then I put her back in the laundry room and left the door shut.

She refused to go through. I put her in the laundry room and closed the door, and after a few hours meowing and scratching at the door, she still hadn't figure it out. So I held the cat door open and she ran through.

So, I have the door taped open right now. She seems to be going through without much of an issue. What are my next steps? How can I train her to nose-open the cat door so I can remove the tape? Should I start progressively lowering the cat door with tape so she starts getting used to pushing through SOME resistance until the door is completely shut?

I'm not used to training cats, so any advice would be helpful. Our cat tends to not like treats, so I can't really do the normal conditioning method like I would with a dog. 




 Basically what the title says. I would like a bay tree, but I doubt our climate is right (6b, southeastern PA). So, I was considering a small potted bay tree.

Are there any hardy pot-friendly cultivars that anyone can recommend?  




 So is this douchebag still outside of the country? 




 Carob doesn't really taste like chocolate - try it plain. It has an overly sweet taste with a hint of chocolate.

Try using espresso, or dry coffee. Also try using dutch process cocoa over regular cocoa. 




 FYI, how progressed is she with celiacs? What proteins can she still consume?  

Lots of folks here seem to be assuming she just cant eat gluten, but a celiac has difficulty digesting all proteins and it gets progressively worse over time. 




 Being unwilling to teach your child cleanliness is not a justification for a exposing your child to a 1-3% rate of surgical complications.

 Because you not liking comcast or twc is not a viable legal basis to block a business merger. There have to be legitimate reasons to block it.

 Honestly, I rarely had time to talk privately with my FIL. I ended up stealing away for a few minutes on a cell phone when the wife (then gf) wasnt around. It was really as simple as asking - "I want to propose to your daughter - can I have your blessing?"

He laughed, cried a little, said yes, and asked if he could tell his wife (I asked him not to because she can talk a lot).

Make sure the family has an old fashioned side or some folks can be offended. 




 First, reach out to a counselor of some type. If you are open to the idea of a deity check out a support group. If you are bullheaded do it on your own.

No matter how you do it, the motivation for change comes from the same place - you. You are the one who chooses what you do and don't put in your body. You are the only person responsible. Be proud of that. This is your chance to make your dreams come true.

Look at yourself in the mirror. Hard. What do you want to change about you, your life, your situation,  etc? How can you improve you? What have you always wanted to do but you haven't done?

Start doing that instead. Even if it is just a little at a time. Set small goals and maintain them. Reward yourself when you fulfill them. Make it a goal to stay clean for a day. Then every day for a week. Then a month. Keep challenging yourself and beating those challenges. Make them simple so you have to exert very little energy to meet them. 

When you start rapidly fulfilling goals your self esteem will go up, which gives you confidence to tackle bigger goals.

Join meetup or cruise craigslist for fledgling companies/charities/nonprofits, and meet some new people. Even if you are antisocial you still need some human contact, and some kind of social group that you can be involved in is a great way to go. Your new job might not be a bad way to go with this. Throw yourself into the work!

Don't get down on yourself if you slip up. It WILL happen. You are human, but god damn it youre trying. Just get back up and keep going.

This is what I did. It wasn't easy.

 Correct, and the difference is specificity. 

The problem is, most children don't make very good witnesses and are very easily swayed. So by what measure would you consider testimony from a child, which could easily be unsubstantiated rantings, to be reliable? 




 Usually there has to be specificity to the statement. You cant say "he has drugs in his house! Go search him!"
 
Think about how easily that vould be misused. No judge would approve it because police could easily start saying someone randomly told them something as a CYA for busting down doors.

Rather the informant needs to say "they have drugs! In their basement there is a drug stash in the back corner under the shelf." Something that provides actual information. 




 Seeing this makes me so happy my main guitar is kept under lock and key, and the only easily accessible guitar is a plastic fantastic little martin. 




 Getting a warrant purely from the statement of one person while having no corroborating evidence to justify the warrant?

Doubtful. 




 Thats bullshit. One person saying something about someone else without any substantive evidence is not a reason for a warrant.  Unless the kid brought in hash oil and said "it's my mom's!" The statements were nothing more than conjecture. 




 I was wondering this as well. In our state (PA) warrants need to be pretty damn specific. This is like saying "a kid said something about his mom, we have no proof beyond that, but lets raid their house." There was no substantive evidence to justify the warrant. Any attorney can pick that apart with ease.

If thats how these things work now, I heard that the judge who signed off in the warrant has an opium poppy grow room in his basement. 




 Well, the issue is that much like Rome, we can blame the beaurocrats all we want, but the problem lies with you and I. Though the folks in power have done a very good job at ensuring that they have the population split down the middle with partisan bullshit.

Bread and circuses is only important if it's all the people care about. 




 This seems like a case the ACLU might be interested in tbh 




 It depends. Private loans have no forgiveness. Only federal which tend to make up a relatively minor amount of the debt load. 




 I would be laughing if I wasn't quietly sobbing into my drink :'( 




 The thing that bothers me is he goes on pushing unproven herbal remedies. Some herbals HAVE shown efficacy - peppermint is good at treating mild stomach discomfort, eucalyptus is good for colds, chamomile for reducing anxiety, ginger for motion sickness, st Johns Wort for acute bouts of depression,  etc.

These are all known and accepted and have a good bit of literature behind them showing they have efficacy. 

But instead he goes out into completely unproven territory pushing products with almost no literature behind them. That bothers me. Especially when he is in fact a doctor and is supposed to be a man of science. Instead he is just a quack. 




 Not at that kind of party :) 




 The part that bothers me the most is, if confronted with evidence that this does happen, many women respond with "well now you understand what women go through." Nothing like victimizing and illegitimizing a victim.  




 Puss puss pass? 




 At that price level. It starts to become worth it at 5k or higher so long as it is pretty cut and dry (which this sounds like) 
























 Just curious if this has happened to anyone. All of our other network devices are behaving just fine. Our echo just suddenly stopped responding.

How did you resolve? Just yank the cord and wait a few minutes? Did it come back on its own? Or did you have to re-setup your echo? 




 Sadly, they do. The one downside of the modern NRA is they have been hellaciously defiant when it comes to any legislation that would enforce any sort of training requirements for gun owners. So there are a ton of folks who get robbed, buy a gun, load up a magazine, and put it in their closet where it sits for years until they need it next. Sadly if they ever try to use it, the barrel is so clogged with dust that it misfires, or worse. 




 For inside a residence? I would recommend either a low/mid gauge shotgun (16 or 20ga should be fine for inside a home), or a mid caliber pistol. We have a single 9mm with JHP cartridges for my wife and I in case of emergencies (whether the human or animal kind).

You want to stay far away from full metal jacket cartridges at all cost for home defense. If a shot gets fired, FMJ bullets can pass through the target, into and through a wall, and into the adjoining home potentially hitting anyone on the other side. JHP will mushroom and either get embedded in the target or at the very least lose so much kinetic energy that it can't travel through the wall.

Note, whether or not JHP cartridges are legal varies by state. I know that in New Jersey, home defense rounds (JHP that have notches cut into them) are illegal, but in PA they are legal. 




 Thanks for pointing this out. I sent in a suggestion to be able to request stock ticker information, and maybe a portfolio summary. It would be great to say, "Alexa, what is the current stock price of GOOG" and get a response like "The current stock price of GOOG, google, is 500 dollars and 75 cents, up 50 cents from the opening bell." 




 We use it constantly, and honestly I would say it's worth even 200$ now that the wife and I have made it part of our workflow. We use it constantly.

* Bluetooth speaker for our phones
* Shopping list - my wife and I are cooking geeks, and you always realize you are out of something when you are in the middle of cooking. The problem is that doesn't always mean you have a chance to write it down. It's extremely easy to just say "Alexa, add smoked paprika to the shopping list" when your hands are occupied.
* Todo list - this is awesome. If we find a small issue with the house, just throw it on there and then we have a hitlist for the weekend
* Time functions - being able to ask the time, set timers, and set alarms is awesome. The only improvement I could think of would be if you could create multiple timers (alexa, add a 30 minute timer for beef, alexa add a 10 minute timer for bread). Usually when we are cooking we have 4-5 different dishes going at once, and trying to remember what device is the timer for what dish can be a little complicated.
* Radio replacement - We used it to remove a clunky old under-cabinet radio that was PITA. Between tunein and iheartradio we have access to all of our local radio stations in perfect clarity, PLUS we have the ability to use pandora which is awesome. I wish there was better spotify integration though.
* Home automation - After fixing some hokey wiring done by the previous homeowner, I realized that several rooms of ours were daisy-chained out of a single 1-gang electrical box. Fixing the issue to bring it to code meant that I effectively cut power to light fixtures in 2 rooms. I have since put in lamps in those rooms using WeMo switches - Alexa is wonderful for controlling them (especially after their firmware was updated). The biggest improvement here would be a wider range of support (hello nest!), and it would be REALLY awesome if they would release a remote that had a speaker built into it.

Worth the price at 99? HELL YES. Worth it at 150? Sure. Worth it at 200? If you are willing to change your personal workflow around a little to take complete advantage of the echo, totally! Otherwise, get in early for the lower price. 




 I did that a few days ago because I thought it was a pile of spinmetal for 10 marks. I was not amused when I had it reversed. Thankfully I only lost 10 marks from it.

 DNRTFA.

Pork. Pigs are kind of a big deal on the east coast, and Pennsylvania has a ton of pig processing plants. So, it's not only really affordable, but plentiful and quite delicious.

 Yup, I meant speaker. Crap. 




 Oh my god, this is the best things I have seen all week! Thank you!! 




 This may sound bizarre, but are you located in California? A friend of mine posted a status on facebook that they heard a small child screaming for a protracted period of time that "I want to die!" over and over. The timing between her post and your post is just too perfect not to ask. 




 Pretty simple question I hope. I need to create a part, but I don't have access to a 3d printer. This is a rather rare instance for me, so it is hard to justify buying a printer for one small part.

Are there any decent, cheap companies that can print a part for me if I send them the file? Specifically, I need a liner for a plant pot created because a decorative planter doesn't have any drainage holes, and no off-the-shelf pots fit the planter, so it would need to be foodsafe plastic. 




 It does, so you would lean towards the 75/25 allocation instead of pure 50/50 based on the current market conditions. 




 There are bond funds out there, most of the major mutual fund companies offer them. Be aware though, they tend to have higher fee schedules than stock funds for some reason (maybe someone out there knows why). I personally participate in the Mellon Aggregate Bond Fund. 




 The basics never change, and the markets still operate more or less the same way. 




 As for allocation, check out the book "The Intelligent Investor" by Ben Graham - it discusses ideal composition of portfolios re: bonds and stocks. Basically in an ideal world you would have 50/50, going so far as 75/25 in either direction based on market conditions. You make slightly less money off of it, but you also greatly reduce risk exposure if one market tanks. 




 Golly, that was his house? It looks beautiful, but it's not hard to see why he passed away penniless. He only really had one literary success - Fitzgerald was broke most of his life, I would have expected to see more modest accommodations. 




 What were your biggest learnings from the whole process? How well were you able to predict when you'd be able to conceive? Were there any major surprises you had never thought about? Are there any major pitfalls that need to be avoided? Are there any "really good ideas" that you wish you had known? 




 This is anecdoctal so take it for what it is. The day I got my driver's license (literally), I was driving home when some idiot tore past me on the highway. I heard sirens in that same lane, and I turned to look. Being a brand new driver, as I turned, my car started to veer into the other lane in the direction I was looking. Coming up fast behind me in that lane was a local cop who had been chasing that car. He slammed on his breaks,  threw up his hands, and waved to pull me over. He realized I just got my license and made a stupid new driver mistake and basically told me that I needed to practice looking around while I was driving because it could literally get me killed. No citation or anything, he just told me to be more careful and get some more practice time in.

About 5 years later I got busted in a speed trap in a little podunk town in rural northern PA. The officer asked me if I had ever been pulled over for speeding, to which I responded no. He came back to my car a few minutes later and asked why I hadn't mentioned having been pulled over for speeding. I didn't know what he was talking about, so I asked him if he could be more specific. Apparently the original officer who had pulled me over the day I got my license had put down "speeding" in whatever database they use to keep track of stuff. I explained what happened - no idea if he believed me or not.

So, at least in PA, based on my experience there is SOME amount of information sharing that goes on at a state-wide level because I have been questions about it. I am not a cop though, so I'm not sure how much is logged/kept on file. This was after a gap of about 8 years. 




 *I feel like chicken tonight, like chicken tonight!* 









 I was doing an earth patrol bounty over the weekend with my lvl 24 toon. Running through the first building you encounter in Old Russia, where you encounter the game's first boss, and suddenly, I am dead. I am dead after being cut down by a level ?? "Queen's Speaker" or something like that. I revive and try again. Again, 1-shotted.

Finally I realize I have to simply run like hell and get through the room as fast as possible and hope I don't get clubbed in the back.

It seems a little crazy they'd put that in the middle of a level 4 patrol! 




 As someone who grew up around deer, I'd have to disagree. Weight-wise you would be ok, the problem is that deer has spent her life learning how to use those hooves as nasty weapons, and you have NOT trained for dealing with that. I've seen huge guys get fucked up by smaller deer than that (idiots who thought they could lasso a deer). 




 Ever since? Try criticizing some, any, aspect of gameplay or how Bungie has operated and the elitism should be painfully apparent, even here on reddit.

Edit: Rated down, there's a shock. Thanks for proving my point. 




 Yeah but in last wish even the short stories are broken up into tiny chapters. Average maybe 10 pages. Vlood of elves is around 50 to 75 pages. 




 My favorite part of last wish was how small and fast everything is to read. It makes it really easy to read a chapter or two before bed. Blood of Elves is so much more chatty at times it can be hard to stick with. 




 Or in the book series. 




 In the US, in many areas it is also the only way to get the point.

 Yeah, ours can't handle it anywhere. When he was younger a thundershirt helped but anymore nothing seems to work. We have carpet runners through most of the house now, and even that can freak him out when he is feeling picky :( 




 Yeah, sadly it doesn't work anymore. I ended up caving and getting GP5. 




 There are a lot of industry apologists in here so I will probably get downvoted to hell, but most greyhounds in the US are treated as commodities,  with some states (specifically Kansas) going so far as to exclude greyhounds from the legal definition of "dog" so as not to be covered by animal protection laws. This is the result of the people who farm and own the hounds lobbying for it, which I think speaks for itself. 




 I picked up nylon string thanks to Rodrigo and Gabriela,  Willie Nelson, Segovia, and Andrew York.

I love fingerstyle, and I figured it was the best way to learn. Sadly I now feel extremely uncomfortable using a pick instead of fingers :)

I picked up a guitar  (Kremona F65C) and booked lessons with our neighbor (who happens to be a Segovia trained guitarist - talk about lucky!). He had me pick up the Christopher Parkening method books and we have been working through that along with learning things like composition and travis picking.

I feel like steel string and electric can be pretty well learned on your own, but classical really requires a teacher, even if just as an occasional check in. 




 We have an adopted greyhound, who was on the track for 6 years. He has a ton of issues because of it. Not the least of which is absolute terror of shiny floors.

 Why the hell would he leave it with 11 minutes left? Why not go to 12 and kill this thing? 




 We are actually really REALLY lucky to have a ton of limestone in our area, which leads to tons of small naturally filtered springs. If I was scooping out of a river I'd absolutely filter. But most of the documented springs in our area (SE PA) are safe to drink from directly. 




 Basically just what the title says. I got home and somehow got in a really really shitty mood. I figured practicing might help to relax me a bit, but I just couldn't get myself to relax. Because of it, trying to play anything felt like banging my head on a wall. Not only didn't I make progress, but I feel like some stuff I could play well before I just sucked at tonight. That just made me more frustrated, and I found myself in a downward spiral.

When I found myself about to smack my classical guitar out of frustration, it was time to call it quits for the night.

Are there some nights that are just "toxic"? What do you do? Do you just walk away for a day? Can they actually screw up your progress?

 It is, but not with the other mixer ingredients mentioned above. You can clean a wound with whiskey, its a lot harder to clean it with a pia colata :) 




 Except the water can be used for any number of things outside of alcohol. If you only take alcohol premixed youre kinda screwed if you need to, say, clean a wound or give a dog some water.

As for hiking, most trails I have been on have a bunch of natural springs that are safe to drink from so you may not necessarily take extra water in with you.

I started out in college as a computer science/psychology dual major, but I couldn't work 2 jobs and still meet the required number of hours so I had to drop the CS major and become a psych major (I could get A's in psych just doing the reading).

The entire time I was in school I was doing technical work - network engineering, systems engineering for the school, hell, even help desk. Luckily this is one of the few arenas where companies are more often concerned about experience and technical certs than they always are about degrees (so long as you have one).

 After some success with growing basil, parsley and lettuce indoors under 6500k bulbs I would like to start augmenting my home growing system. Howeber I am unsure about the way to proceed. There are a lot of ways I could go - ebb flow, aeroponics, drip, etc. I haven't really found a good text that summarizes all of the different systems and provides info on how to build them.

Can anyone point me in a good direction? 




 Superbly done. I have never been able to get them perfectly round, not that I haven't tried (I just don't want to buy a pan, and trying to fill a circular template isn't always exact). I just figure my amoebae shaped macarons look homemade, lol.

 Honest questions from someone who was pretty disgusted after completing the vanilla story mode.

First, I have no friends on PSN, is there finally decent matchmaking? Or at least a way to easily communicate with other players to find people trying to do the same thing? Or am I still expected to exit the game and rely on PSN messages in the middle of a firefight?

Second, has Bungie provided any decent means of support? I was having major issues and kept getting directed to post on their forum - where issues went to die without ever seeing a response. I paid for a product, I expect support.

 We picked up a single WeMo switch, attached to a den lamp. The device is entitled "den lamp" and was added to the group "den lights". If I use the WeMo app and then try and use the Echo, it works just fine.

However if I wait an hour or two and then say "Alexa, turn off the den lamp" or "turn off the den lights" she responds "OK" and that's it. Nothing happens. The light stays on.

Is anyone else encountering this?

 Pip meets Miss Havisham, from Great Expectations. Sorry for the length.

This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told from within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady's dressing-table.

Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.

She was dressed in rich materials,satins, and lace, and silks,all of white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about. She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,the other was on the table near her hand,her veil was but half arranged, her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the looking-glass.

It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if I could.

"Who is it?" said the lady at the table.

"Pip, ma'am."

"Pip?"

"Mr. Pumblechook's boy, ma'am. Cometo play."

"Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close."

It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.

"Look at me," said Miss Havisham. "You are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born?"

I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer "No."

"Do you know what I touch here?" she said, laying her hands, one upon the other, on her left side.

"Yes, ma'am." (It made me think of the young man.)

"What do I touch?"

"Your heart."

"Broken!"

She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept her hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were heavy.

 I an app in mind. First, my wife and I have a hell of a time figuring out where to eat on date nights. I want to register restaurants with Alexa, and when we can't decide, be able to ask her for a random item off the list.

I have some other ideas in mind, but that's the one I think would be most fun. 




 Honestly, I would suggest you start learning some music theory in addition to Rocksmith at this point. Justinguitar offers an awesome book on music theory for guitarists, and learning that will give you mastery of not only the fretboard, but knowledge of how chords and scales work and how they're created.

The way I look at it, Rocksmith teaches you to play songs on guitar, it doesn't teach you guitar or how to play guitar - it's a subtle but important difference. It's a great tool but it can't do everything.

 I actually am a r d engineer in the tech industry, at a reviled "evil" corporation that relied on vendor lock-in. So I am extremely familiar with how it works from both perspectives. That negative sentiment builds up like grain dust. Think it doesn't matter? Look at the Comcast/TWC merger which was brought down largely because of customer sentiment.

Your line of thinking is traditionally correct, and would have been correct about 10, maybe even 5 years ago. Hell it is correct just about everywhere except the tech arena, so please don't think I'm saying you're wrong. But it doesn't work as well with the modern tech industry landscape. The industry on the whole is moving towards an "internet of things" model, relying on lots of easily accessible api-driven services.

Fighting that tide has very real tangible costs. Support calls require paid support staff to field all of those "how do I get X to work!?" questions (in my industry a call costs anywhere from 8 to 10 dollars between payroll and fallout). When you tell a customer something can't work with your product, their initial reaction will be to think your product is crap. They will then look at your competitors to see if they work with it. Your competitors capitalize on your bad decision by marketing all of the services they do allow interoperability with and slinging some mud about how you are dated and noncompetitive. You start bleeding out customers, and end up losing a large number of them to a small company that used an open approach from the beginning because customers want freedom to use what they want and that company understood it.

At this point you sorely regret your decision to force your customers to play in a sandbox instead of taking an open approach and leveraging current technology to its fullest, all necause you wanted to squeeze a few months of profit instead of building a platform for a lifetime of revenue.

I wish I could say I was unfamiliar with this, but I have lived through it.

The traditional business model fails terribly time and again in the tech world. Look at Roku and OpenStack are both great examples. It especially fails when other competitors exist because they will gladly brutalize one another, and they do. Siri, Cortana, and Google Now are all competitors in the same niche, albiet slightly different. Why would any company want to give customers a reason to go to the competition? 




 Give a fuck about what? Wanna go ride bikes??? 




 I dont think anyone is expecting accuracy beyond a ballpark figure. I am well aware I need an appraisal to find out the real number. 

My concern is more that something caused the value to plummet 35k according to their estimate, and I am wondering what could have done that (their algorithm isnt published). 




 My issue is getting rid of pmi, which is based on current home value whether or not I am selling.

 To be fair, reduce does not mean the same thing as eliminate. You still are coating your throat and lungs in oil, and pulling particulate matter (stuff that can pass your screen, if you have one). You may also get some minor exposure to combustion byproducts if your vape has a hotspot.

I can corroborate OP's experience (at least part way). Regular vaping causes my throat and lungs to feel "off" - there's something there making them dirty. Enough that I occasionally try to cough it out.

However unlike smoking I can still train for running while regularly vaping. I don't seem to have the same issue with lung capacity or if I do it is so minor that training compensates for any loss. 

I use about .08g/day with either a MFLB or arizer solo. I have an orbiter water piece but only use it with the solo and not the mflb. 




 Hopefully this is the right place to ask. In November 2011 my wife and I bought our house. 

In 2013 our neighbors had the idea to sell their home and move into an apartment to save money.  Their house never sold, and as of a few days ago notice got posted on their door that the house was in foreclosure and up for sheriff's sale.

Looking at the zillow estimate, around midway through 2013 our home value dropped from 195k (the professionally appraised value) down to about 160k and is slowly crawling back up.

The only things we did were remove an above ground pool and add fill/sod, and replace the oil heater with a far more efficient one.

Did the neighbors going into foreclosure smack us? Was it because we removed the pool? Is the zillow estimate completely wrong? I am asking because we want to get rid of pmi but the dropping home value is making it a moving target, and our mortgage company demands we pay for an appraisal to have it removed early. If we pay for an appraisal and it IS down to 160k in value, not only are we screwed on pmi but we are out the cost of the appraisal.

 Heat should have done this for you. Gay-Lussac's Law states that as temperature increases, pressure increases. Throwing it in the oven upside down and cranking the heat should be enough to pop it out. 




 There is an unofficial API, but leveraging something like that for a product is really not a great idea. It's kind of odd because it seems very un-google-y. 




  I'm picturing the Echo team cringing at these words.

And I'm picturing users not caring. A user doesn't care about business objectives - they care about user experience. And ultimately, Amazon is asking users to vote for them with their dollars. When a company starts diminishing user experience and making excuses about trying to contain the user in their ecosystem, users rebel. It's such an outmoded way of thinking in today's tech world. Remember when IOS pulled out google maps and replaced it with their inferior product? Google announced a separate maps app, users flocked to it, and ios maps got torn apart for being shitty in comparison to google maps. The only way to make it work is to offer a truly superior service to other available options.

And I'd argue that Siri and Cortana are both direct competitors, with the additional capability of being mobile. I can ask siri to add a timer, to add a todo list item, and more. 

As mentioned in other posts, what will really set this apart is not trying to limit users, but enabling as many API's as possible. 




 As of now the wife and I both have the echo app installed. We are aiming to use this as a replacement for an ugly old clockradio in our kitchen that has the ability to set timers and create our shopping list (for now). Also, checking traffic, news, and weather would be helpful.

I've gone through tunein and iheartradio and added all of our local stations. Does Alexa to know to check both of them when I ask her to play a station?

Can my wife and I both set up traffic reports? Does Alexa know whether it is my wife or I asking her who needs the traffic report, or do I have to log into the app every time a different one of us needs a traffic report? From what I am reading I need to open the app, enter a destination address, and then it will tell me a traffic report. However, my wife and I work in completely different directions so the traffic report would be completely different between both of us. It sounds like we would need to log in, switch the destination to one of our workplaces, and then ask questions (honestly kind of a PITA)

I am assuming this also only works with a single prime account, and not separate prime accounts, right? 




 Looks wonderful except for the fruits and vegetables. This is 'Murica. We don't eat foods that can't give diabetes.  




 If you like it, try to track down episodes of "Heston's Great British Food". There is a lot of similarities. Heston owns several restaurants including the Fatted Duck which has several times been crowned the "best restaurant on Earth".

The show has him choosing a dish or style of dish, analyzing its history and cultural importance to the UK, and then completely reinterpreting the dish in amazing ways. It's a super cool show! 




 This reminded me of a time when I was in college. I was finishing a law internship and had come back home before I went to my biology class to take an exam.

I railed about .75g and felt absolutely 100% confident that I was going to rock the test's world. I answered every question with awesome responses. I handed it in and awaited my A.

Most disappointing failing grade I ever got.

Cocaine makes you feel like you can do anything, and are amazing at everything you do. Other than that, it doesn't make you feel much. And then when it wears off you have to deal with the consequences of coming down and realizing that half the stuff you tried you failed horribly at.

It started with going to a buddy's house and trying a line. Other than feeling a little reassured it wouldn't kill me, I was very underwhelmed. So I did another line. I was still underwhelmed. So I did another line... and so on. I never found it nearly as rewarding as say, mushrooms, ecstasy, or pot. I also saw it turn some folks I cared about into monsters of people. Stealing from me, having hallucinations, punching holes in walls, literally acting like they were schizophrenic, dropping their panties for anyone who happened to be around at the right time. It was bad.

College was a hell of a time.

 Honestly, if they set off something that went boom outside the building, I'd think you could very likely damage the disks anyway (write arms aren't the toughest thing while they are reading  a rotating platter, and a percussion wave wouldn't be too friendly to them).

I'm actually kinda curious if that has been tested. 




 That looks wonderful, and I'm jealous!
Every time I've tried to make brisket flat I've had some weird issue pop up. The first time, I couldn't get my smoker to temp properly (it kept spiking). The second, my probe thermometer's probe malfunctioned and kept giving readings about 20 degrees below where temp actually was. Needless to say, the brisket was cardboard. Lessons learned :) Great work! Especially for your first time out! 




 Drop a piece of meat into hot oil and watch the oil temp. A fall of anywhere from 10 to 50 degrees can and will happen. The cast iron heat retention absolutely helps minimize that. 




 This. A Dutch oven and a candy thermometer is all you need, and its a fraction of the price of a normal fryer. It doesn't necessarily have to be ceramic/enamel coated either. 




 They don't have any oil. 




 Classical guitarist. Can confirm. 




 Sadly there is no legal benchmark for the burden of proof that has been set. And you can bet that bank will send a ton of witnesses to represent their side at a bankruptcy hearing with the express goal of proving you can afford to pay off their loan. That's why getting student loans removed never happens. 




 Depends who signed the loan. If it was signed by his parents only it technically isn't his responsibility. If his folks died, it would have to be paid off by the estate. The bank may try to trick him into thinking it is his issue but it legally wouldn't be.

If he signed the loan as well, the loan is his too. If his parents die, it goes to him. And depending on the terms of the loan it could be due in its entirety immediately.  




 First, don't use quotes. It's not hyperbole. 

She did have it backed up. On an external drive. Which was stolen by the burglar, along with a $24,000 custom saxophone, a laptop with a ton of her compositions, an ipad, a guitar, and several other items.

If you read the TOS, you are purchasing a license to the music, not the file itself. Which means there was nothing blocking Amazon from providing a second copy. They simply refused to do so, despite our attorney pointing this out to them when he presented them with a copy of the police report.

At the time, all other music services of the same ilk allowed for re-downloading of lost music. Amazon was several years behind the competition in this way, and only within the last 2 years provided the ability to re-download purchased music.

Their product and their customer service simply sucked at the worst possible time, and it was absolutely the last thing we needed to deal with after having our lives flipped upside down. 




 Sorry OP, I perfer guitars from Fenver. 




 I wish my wife did this. Every damn day: "where is my phone!?" "Oh shit I can't find my wallet!" "I really hope my keys are in your car!"

 You should do yourself a favor and google "[bread and circuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses)". Basically as empires pass their prime, lower socioeconomic class people become far more interested in selfish things - "What can I do to make sure I eat and am entertained?" The ruling classes appease the people with those things, and public participation in politics wanes.
They don't have a vested interest in government because they're essentially left out of it, and their needs are met. So why vote, right? This walks hand-in-hand with financialization (the movement toward income inequality as money is concentrated more and more in the wealthiest socioeconomic classes). It's also a very good reason why the citizens united decision was absolutely idiotic and shows that, despite their intellogence, the supreme court justices apparently aren't very good at history.

Folks basically stop caring. It happened in Greece, it happened in Rome, and it is happening now in the US. Its easy to see in action too: Ask your average American who their representatives and senators are and see what response you get. Ask them who the players are on their favorite sports team and compare the results. 




 I agree. Other than prime I dont use the amazon ecosystem. Amazon's fault too... my wife is a music teacher, and had spend several thousand dollars on the amazon music store for mp3s. Her laptop got stolen when our house was robbed and Amazon basically told her to piss off and couldn't provide the downloads a second time (this has since changed,  but sadly she had to rebuy a lot of her music until amazon got its head out of its ass). I've tried to avoid many of their services ever since.

I'd also prefer google's ecosystem. 




 I have a gas card that my wife and I both use to pay for gas and occasional expenses. The limit is $1200, and most months we take it up to about $1000. 

We pay the statement balance every month. Does utilizing that much of the credit line hurt my credit score? I have several other cards but this is the only one that is used heavily. 




 On the upside, every Moldovan woman I have ever met is gorgeous, so your country has that going for it, which is nice.

 This reminds me of the worst date I ever went on. Things were going awesome with this REALLY pretty girl. We went hiking in the morning/afternoon, ended up playing games with some handicapped kids, etc. It was a great start.

Then we went out for drinks. Holy hell it was like I went on to a minefield. 

Me: "So you moved back here from California?" 

Her: "Yeah, I had to give up my dream to help out my family." 

Me: "Oh my god, I'm so sorry! Are you at least close to your family??" 

Her: "Yeah, you get close when your house burns down." 

Me: "Uh, wow, that's a really shitty stream of luck. At least you guys have eachother right?" 

Her: "Well we did. My dad just died a few days ago."

Me: "Well... fuck. Hey bartender, can you make that bourbon a neat triple please?"

At the end of the date I walked myself home and couldn't stop laughing because of how absurdly bad the date went. I kept asking polite questions to learn more and every single one led to something negative. I wasn't even mad, just amused. Sometimes the world just takes a turn toward the negative and the best you can do is relax and laugh off how unlikely it was. 




 Usually that would require the contract to be unconscionable, or otherwise violate law, and often that only invalidates specific clauses. 




 There has to be a meeting of the minds and consideration. Cash exchanged hands already, as did the trade in, so there's your consideration. Deal's done.

 Terry Frisk requires reasonable suspicion. 

I am not 100% sure about how the police became aware of Gray (it has been hell to find real details through all of the fallout), so I'm not sure what the reasoning was. If it was just a chance encounter there is very little reason to have frisked him. If the police got a report that someone who looked like Gray was causing a problem, then there is a totally legit reason to have frisked him.

Does anyoene have meatier details about the whole encounter and why the police got involved in the first place? 




 151 still doesn't hold a candle to 195 proof everclear. 




 So they essentially use the same support system Bungie used for Destiny. Oi vey. 




 OT but I wish I could have stuck with ni no kuni. I loved it until I got past the trials and had another human to control. Suddenly the game went from fun combat to a wall of micromanaging that really turned me off.

I wish they had added a turn-based approach as well as an active approach. .. it would have probably made it more enjoyable for me. 




 I bought a ps3 at the end of the last year and I am having a high old time.

The only games that interest me so far on PS4 are kingdom Hearts 3, final fantasy 15, and witcher 3. I really hope they make more ps3 titles compatible too.

 This is totally correct - we do have one rub to add in. My FIL is extremely well off, and usually if we require a home loan we can borrow privately from him. DTI isn't much of an issue because of that. The downside of this is that we will usually drop everything off to pay him back ASAP (debt between family is... uncomfortable).
