 The owner just asked me about him just adding Peroni to his mix, which I sort of tut-tutted.  He seems to be genuinely interested in stocking better options than the usual national suspects.  It looks like got cooler space for maybe 24 options.  What do you think? 




























































































































 If this is an RES thing, please advise and I'll submit there.

I'm stuck with a perpetual -1 next to me.  When I try to upvote or downvote myself, it increases the -1 to -2 and -3, but I can get it back to -1. 

I don't know how I did this, but I spent a lot of east coast USA late hours in /r/olympics last week while tipsy.  I think I may have inadvertently tried to upvote a comment I forgot that I had made -- things were moving very fast in say the womens slalom thread.  Maybe I tried upvoting an event thread which were self posts?  

Any idea how to set myself back to neutral?
 












































 You have to hand it to NBC.  They suck but sometimes they don't.

 Yahoo seems to be set up for game by game predictions like an NFL pool.  I think in past WC's I've done pools more like an NCAA basketball bracket where you have to predict the F4 and so on before the tournament begins.

 I completely and absolutely disagree!

The Chinese are a communist state and could harness whatever they needed for their opening.  It was spectacular, but as I was watching it, I thought "at what cost?"

The Brits had a terrific opening themselves, and free world.  

However, it was their closing ceremony that I will always remember.

 Only during sports and reality shows.

Fun anecdote: when Survivor was a cultural thing, in the season 2 finale, I was watching with my windows open.  Runner-up Colby made a decision that guaranteed him not to win (he took Tina to the final two).  

As soon as he did it, I yelled "YOU FUCKING MORON!" out of frustration and anger at the top of my lungs... and could hear people up and down my block laughing.   




 I re-checked -- yup somebody posted it in there, but only part 2.  Only 18 upvotes.   

I dunno.

I absolutely love /r/truereddit -- you have great taste in r/'s.   




 I'm kind of happy about this.  Uber's great but I never liked how it puts the costs   benefits of driving for them onto the newbie drivers.  It's not a career driving for Uber.   









 I thought this was a fake due to the euro style of printing of the phone number with a period instead of a dash...

but apparently it's true:

 All I can say is that we were both in ski boots, which is a great equalizer.  

I imagine he wears higher heels or lifts when in day to day public. 

Nothing wrong with this at all -- he needs to project his larger than life persona and I wouldn't fault him.  

I'm just saying I think he's naturally shorter than me -- I, too, was surprised to find this.  

He's still a big MF. 




  Aleksa Palladino

I have been in love with her since her arc in Boardwalk Empire.  I don't speak metric, but an online converter says she's 5.74147 feet and that Lee Pace of 195cm is 6.39764 feet tall.  That's about right actually.

I'm 5'11" and a 5'7" girl would be roughly at the level of my nose.  Had I grown another four inches, shoulder is about right. 




 He speaks in a Texas "good ole boy" vernacular.  It's not important.  He rarely says what he really means.  Those guys speak in visual cues.  I love them. 




 I'm old enough to remember Jolt cola, the Red Bull/Monster too early energy drink -- this is the soda can Gordon speared at the beginning.

I had one once.  Once. 




 Rumor on Dexter: the reason he became a lumberjack is because as a child in that container, he watched his mother get dismembered by a chainsaw.

I just heard this today and was all Sudden Clarity Clarence.

 




 I bet the Turner family isn't going to let GRRM anywhere near that cute doggie. 




 Really?  If I don't hear the confirmation beep, I try to rescan it once or twice, and then the driver usually nods me back into seating. 

I've never been yelled at by a Metrobus driver.

 That's exactly it for me.  The Orioles seem nice enough but OMG how I hate their owner. 




 If you haven't read this two-part long-form article on the investigation into Silk Road, this is a must-read:

http://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/

I read them in the print edition. Force is a major character, but I don't remember anything about Bridges.
 




 OK Mythbusters, solve this one. 




 I don't know where they'd fit.  Too long for new, I'm sure tech's already seen them, and I think I saw them on truereddit -- I was suprised because I had to wait a month between part 1 and 2 for the next issue to arrive -- I subscribe -- and there it was online.

The formatting of the print articles was really interesting so I waited it out.   




 YAY they remembered us in DC! 




  If a 1960s show is rerun today, the content may be edited by nine minutes to make room for the extra advertisements.

This really infuriates me.

Anyhow, I DVR basically everything and ffwd through the commericals.   




 I've met Schwarzenegger while skiing.  I'm 5'11" and he's shorter than me.  Maybe 5'9".

I have never seen shoulders that wide though, even under a ski jacket.   




 Staged.  Why would the frisbee thrower throw it to the dog? 




 The celtic chief probably trusted a lieutenant to bury them, then the Romans killed anybody who knew where they were buried. 




 I really hope somebody remembers this article when it comes time to hand out the Pulitzers.  Not only did the journalist write a compelling true crime piece, but also explained the technology seamlessly, not to mention the applicable laws.   




 I have it -- is that what caused it? 




 Holy crap you're right.  All three were about the same age -- Gable was six years older.

 I'd go see it, too, if I was in the area one day.

I'd wear a Ford Pinto Owners' Association T-shirt though. 




 Still there?  I'm typing to you from a rainy Georgetown.  Do you ever miss DC? 




 Maybe they should've planted a callback?  I dunno.  It's still a pretty bad finale. 




 They could even take away his red stapler. 




 I gave up on the first season for that reason.  The red herring of the Muslim school teacher?  I was out. 




 Whoa.  Thank you for that!

 




 Ah he wasn't a draft dodger by any stretch.  He was 34 when Pearl Harbor was bombed.  That being said, he didn't exert himself to serve.  I have read that the WWII vets resented him for all of his war movies.

From wiki:

America's entry into World War II resulted in a deluge of support for the war effort from all sectors of society, and Hollywood was no exception. Wayne was exempted from service due to his age (34 at the time of Pearl Harbor) and family status, classified as 3-A (family deferment). He repeatedly wrote John Ford saying he wanted to enlist, on one occasion inquiring whether he could get into Ford's military unit, but consistently kept postponing it until after "he finished just one or two pictures".[4]:212 Wayne did not attempt to prevent his reclassification as 1-A (draft eligible), but Republic Studios was emphatically resistant to losing him; Herbert J. Yates, President of Republic, threatened Wayne with a lawsuit if he walked away from his contract,[4]:220 and Republic Pictures intervened in the Selective Service process, requesting Wayne's further deferment.[4]:213

Wayne toured U.S. bases and hospitals in the South Pacific for three months in 1943 and 1944.[4]:253 with the USO[27][28][29] By many accounts, Wayne's failure to serve in the military was the most painful experience of his life.[4]:212 His widow later suggested that his patriotism in later decades sprang from guilt, writing: "He would become a 'superpatriot' for the rest of his life trying to atone for staying home."[30]

U.S. National Archives records indicate that Wayne had, in fact, made an application [31] to serve in the OSS, today's equivalent of the CIA, and had been accepted within the U.S. Army's allotted billet to the OSS. William Donovan, OSS Commander, wrote Wayne a letter informing him of his acceptance in to the Field Photographic Unit, but the letter went to his estranged wife Josephine's home. She never told him about it.[32] Donovan also issued an OSS Certificate of Service to Wayne.[33] 




 Yeah I saw the one with 37 miles (kilometers?) on the odometer and thought the same thing.

It's a Toyota.  Of course it'll eventually start. 




 I lived in London in '89 and can't donate either.   




 Fun fact: in the movie Invictus, Mandela gives a copy of the poem Invictus to the rugby captain.

In real life, Mandela gave him this speech. 




 Erin Cummings -- Sparty's wife in Spartacus -- is in the mix, too.   




 Yeah I know.  Armed guards in a very tight space.  I'd had too much vodka the night before.  It would've been a real problem. 

































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 *What's the problem?*   
I reformatted my computer three weeks ago.  Never ending RES used to get me to 1000 or more and is now conking out at 200. 

Just now I got "There doesn't seem to be anything here! (Why not?)" at 25.



*What other browser extensions are installed?*  
On Firefox: AdBlock, BetterPRivacy, FEBE, Ghostery, HTTPS-Everywhere, NoScript, NoSquint, RES, SecureSanitzer, TinEye, and the only new addition to my line-up YouTube High Definition 36.0.

Except for YouTube HD, this was my exact line-up pre-reformatting.  

Is there anything I can do to get back to seeing never ending reddit displaying deep into the 800's?

 Can anybody provide examples of such videos?  I'd like to see what the fuss is all about. 




 Good.  Good.  Let the purr flow through you.

All kidding aside, get thee to a shelter.  I was a rookie cat owner when I got adopted, but my gf at the time had cats and coached me.

PM me if you need advice/how-to's.

Also consider getting two.   




 I've got a 12-year old orange tabby who was a feral kitten that adopted me at the beach just like the little kitten in the vid.

He and I are besties.   




 You and I are of the same iTunes tinkering fellowship.

I don't understand why Steve of this story didn't do the same.  He had the song requests in advance.  It'd be maybe 10 minutes to set up a playlist. 




 IIRC, Probst had just announced that a guy allied with the two girls had been voted off, while Matty in the middle hated the guy. 




 That's correct.  It looked like a preppy college jacket   tie combo.

Dunno why I'm getting these downvotes. 




 Sorry -- what does this bot do?
 




 I bet legal fees ate up a huge chunk of the winnings. 




 You'll be fine around there.  I'd run southwest on NY Ave until you hit 15th and then across the pedestrian block of Penn to see the White House, take a left on 17th and down to the Mall.  Be careful crossing Constitution.  

Alternatively 10th St. takes you past the montrosity of the FBI building and Ford's Theater one block up. 




 I love this site:

http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-202-559-6606/11

This number's got 11 pages of comments, so yes it's a national thing.   




 Oh wow talk about a cat who hit the lottery.  

My cat will eat almost anything but I guarantee you that if he lived in a sushi joint, he'd be just like this cat.   




 The number of details really helped sell it.  He was wearing a jacket and tie that is exactly what a white guy in college would wear.   




 I live in Washington DC.  Only recently -- maybe the past two years -- were the liquor stores allowed to be open on Sundays.  We could get wine and beer from the small grocery stores throughout the city.

 




 Oops I did.  Thanks. 














 Many thanks!

I was standing in the main viewing stand with the official countdown timer just in front of me.  I remember that just after they announced the abort, the heatwave from the main engines hit me and lifted the cuffs of my pants.  

I can only imagine what the full launch would've done. 

Earlier that year, maybe even late '84, I happened to be in a parking lot in Santa Barbara waiting for a bus shuttle to LA when two sonic booms startled me.  

Yup, a shuttle landing at Vandenburg.  I had no idea what the sound was until I got home.  It sounded like a pair of surround sound shotgun blasts, but catching you more in the chest. 




 What bugs me about the story is that the owner didn't trust your dad to camp there anymore.  Like he'd done something wrong.

The owner knew something that your dad didn't know. 




 Gotta love a cat that runs towards danger rather than away.

I have an 18 pound orange tabby tomcat.  Nothing happens in my neighborhood unless he wants it to happen. 




 I've read the letter where Franklin expressed this view -- it was in the context of a letter to his nephew.

I thought it was tongue in cheek.

He might've been somewhat serious, but the letter was definitely uncle-trolling. 




 I think ospreys are eagles, just more sea-going.   




 You and me, brother.  I don't think we're alone. 




 *insight

I didn't know it existed.  I grew up in the 70's so if there's any detail you need, I was there.  

Did they report on the Schwinn banana seat bicycle?  That was the defining thing to own for my generation as boys.

Typically though I find these retrospectives are done knowing now what happened and filtered accordingly.  

Jerry Ford's handling of the Pueblo Crisis is a footnote now, but I remember it got my attention.  We'd just gotten out of Vietnam and suddenly North Korea wanted to mess with us.  We really didn't need that. 




 I doubt the FBI got its panties twisted by somebody's bumper sticker, but I also wouldn't doubt that somebody somewhere asked for context and easily got it.

The hashtag if it actually got used on twitter would've been NSA/DHS territory.  Again, the context was I bet easily found. 




 That might -- MIGHT -- have been true for the 50's.  But don't forget about Sputnik demonstrating superior space technology and the leaks of the hydrogen bomb to the Soviets.

Then they put missiles in Cuba.  That to my mind is when the Cold War turbocharged itself.   




 It's true.  They support adoption for the cat or doggie and hope you'll come back to them for food   accessories if not grooming. 




 Sylar is the nutshell for everything wrong with Heroes.

I'm not impressed by this trailer.  Looks like the same old bait   switch of the original.

I actually got a little angry watching it. 




 I was high school class of '80.  Youngest bro did well for himself. 




 The Citizen Kane spoiler was also I think a Billy Crystal joke on SNL so it's forgivable.   




 The problem with international law is that it's an awfully amorphous field.

I know a lawyer who is always flying around the world doing negotiations and making deals, but not as an international lawyer but an expert in US medical devices.  

When I think of international lawyers, I think of State Department or USAID people.  Those are great jobs to have btw. 




 Get onto the running paths of the C O Canal and you look up at the streets crossing it.  Dunno if that's what you're looking for.   




 Tyrion Lannister: "One game at a time." 




 Duke fans individually are perfectly fine.

It's when they get together as a group that's the problem. 




 Dunno if there will be any Colombians or Argentinians there, but Lucky Bar should do nicely.  Call ahead to make sure they're showing it but they almost certainly will be. 




 Zookeepers around the world have been imitating Chris Pratt in Jurassic World:

http://www.dorkly.com/post/74902/zookeepers-around-the-world-are-chris-pratt-ing-with-their-animals

It's sort of like Tebowing except not annoying.

With actual dinosaurs, that Smithsonian curator just won the competition.   




 I remember at just about this point last season thinking "OK the Nats are good but can they solve the Braves problem?"

They did and I've moved on to worrying about other franchises. 




 Wow.  Giving away a broken-in glove? 




 Doesn't look too bad.  That stuff a few nights ago was apocalyptic in comparison. 




 It has to be something regional.  I'd get a referral to somebody who specializes in food allergies or reactions.  This is the kind of problem they love to solve. 




 I now agree with you all -- FP at very least had too much coffee this morning. 




 That's annoying.   




 FP still appears to be traumatized by Yoga in the Park. 




 AZ can just ask for your papers on demand?  If that's part of a traffic stop, I don't see a problem -- license and registration are required everywhere -- but papers on demand?

Yeah that's not going to last long. 




 That was some terrific situational hitting.  Escobar's hit in particular. 




 Here in DC the police cannot ask jaywalkers for ID.  They're affirmatively prohibited from it.  I guess they'd had problems with pretext arrests back in the day.   




 Here's the Post with detail:

 Is that house a carbon copy of the Amityville Horror house? 




 This is true:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe#Military_service_in_the_Revolutionary_War_and_serious_wounding 




 I saw Challenger abort in '85.  So disappointing.  They'd lit the main engines, something went wrong, and they pulled the plug before lighting the SRB's.   




 At first I thought who would rob a movie set and why is a costumer so brave?

Then... typo. 




 I jog past the Watergate and sometimes ponder all the other gates it has spawned.   




 If you like gin, that Green Hat Gin named in honor of him is really good.  It's actually distilled in DC, too.   




 I'd add womens tennis to that list.  I love watching the Williams sisters.  Olympic swimming doesn't suck, either. 

Regarding softball, I once batted against a female colleague who had pitched for I think Stanford.  I like to think of myself as a decent batter but I have never felt that kind of frustration and humiliation.  I didn't know a softball could physically travel that fast. 




 Verifying it is one thing; establishing its provenance is quite a different matter.  

I'm smelling war loot.  They're going to need to establish that it wasn't stolen.   









 USA 0-1 China or maybe a PK situation but I have a feeling the USA is done

Germany 3-1 France

Australia 1-2 Japan

Canada 0-1 England which I know is a huge upset but I've got another feeling
 




 Dunno about that hygiene grade... 









 Wow.  Virginia won something.  What is this feeling I'm experiencing? 




 At least in Virginia, not so much.  It's not the economic powerhouse of northern Virginia, but the true poverty line doesn't start until you get closer to the West Virginia line.   




 Niners and Nationals fan + Wahoos.  

Gin is the only thing that eases the pain. 




 Didn't it fall through though?

What's going on with that parcel now?  Is it the big Trump development? 




 The line running from northern Virginia into Georgia roughly tracks the Appalachian mountains.  Lots of Scots-Irish settled those highlands.  Lucky people, too -- it's gorgeous.   




 Special hell for this bastard. 




 Ah Desi you wonderful wonderful man. 




 BFA! 




 Same thing going on here in DC.  The whole city feels like a construction site. 




 I think that it's also that many of us (I'm from SW Virginia) have families that have been here so long that it's impossible to pin down which European country is our origin.

Taking the four names of my grandparents, I've got French, German, English, and Welsh.  It gets exponentially muddled going back through generations, with one line going back to Pocahontas.  

So for me it's impossible to say.   




 It's something in your diet.  Start switching things around.  A food allergy is most likely. 




 I grew up in the 70's and burned my tongue so many damn times on their coffee before I just started going elsewhere.

It was really crappy watery coffee, too.   




 Call the admissions director and voice your concerns.  Maybe they'd give you a fresh start.  And how come this suspension is so long -- I thought the typical suspension for a flunk-out was a semester or two.   




 Of course.  I bet that if you wrote the prestigious university and explained that you're better now, they'd let you back in, too.  Nobody's going to be around anymore from your original class.   




 Did they every ID the body they found that had the connection to the shoeshine guy in I think Crystal City?

I bet this poor guy's death is somehow related to the storms. 




 And from the country that produced Kafka. 




 One of my friends had a pair -- his wife was allergic.  They were kind of cute once you got used to them having no hair.

They always cuddled with a human for warmth.  Adorable. 




 I think people congregate on the Lincoln end of the Mall.  But the Capitol end is where they have the concert, so that's going to be affected. 




 I gasped out loud.  It's rare for something on the internet to make me do that. 




 I live in DC.  Woe unto those on the Red Line. 




 There's a mistake in this -- the Chicago bid was for 2016, which Rio won.

The US 2012 bid was NYC, which was dead on arrival.  No place to put the Olympic stadium.   




 We're in agreement then.  

ESPN needs to learn that nobody outside on NY and New England cares. 




 That rivalry annoys the bejesus out of me for all the press it gets, but I think it's the very model of a rivalry that is NOT forced.   




 I live in DC and it's a real beating to get to FedEx.  Once there, it's a joyless experience.   




 This is misleading.  There are plenty of coaches who are in fantastic shape (Pete Carroll, the Harbaughs). 




 I hope but I think the ship has sailed again.  Who knows -- maybe the USOC has some DC partisans in it.  I think we sadly have to assume that if if yanks Boston, the bid goes to LA. 




 I really wanted to transcribe his rant on Hall of Fame voters living in their basements with their moms and voting all day.  "Not that there's anything wrong with it." 









 Here's a great article about what it would have looked like:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/digger/wp/2015/06/12/why-the-olympics-washington-didnt-win-could-still-transform-the-city/

I saw the 2012 bid plans which DC lost to NYC and this is MUCH better.  It's a damn shame it lost. 




 I went for the second week as an adult.  It was great.  I saw Michael Johnson run both the 200m and the 400m.  

Exhausting, but what a great week.   




 Yeah I'm seeing lots of red links today.  Anybody know what's going on? 




 FWIW anytime I hear of somebody named Gay, I think of the sole survivor of VT-8 at Midway:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Gay,_Jr. 




 Great news.  Boston's bid is effectively a replay of the disastrous NYC bid for 2012.

I wish DC had gotten the bid, but if the USOC goes with LA, the Olympics are almost certain to be there.   




 SPANNING! 




 That's from Chelsea James.  She's one of the Post's baseball writers. 




 Alright.  I'll go on a beer run.   




 Great.  My satellite just came back on only to hear Dave toss the broadcast to EPSN until 8:30.  

Too bad this isn't a Friday.  We could have another Padres drinkfest.
 




 Oh.  Well I'll have a G T anyway.  The tink is the ice going into the glass. 




 The winter games are an entirely different beast from the summer games though.   




 If you look at the Post's radar loop, it looks like it's just a glancing blow.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/

Still I looked out my back window a few minutes ago and it looked as dark as it get closer to 8pm. 




 Wahoowa!  Is that tink for a gin   tonic? 




 I liked Bryce winning the walkoff.  The guy's seen Zoolander; she hasn't. 









 "Everyone's a critic."

POW! 














 I just became a commie about downvoting to 1783.

 September 3, 1783
 The United States and Great Britain sign the Treaty of Paris and Great Britain signs a separate treaty with France and Spain.

I am no damn commie! 




 That's always bothered me too.

It's kind of like when the NFL Cardinals went to Arizona, suddenly Phoenix didn't want to acknowledge the St. Louis years.  

Mind you, they had good reason, and so does Minnesota for the Senators, but the '24 era players ought to be commemorated somehow. 




 Trust me: the TV show was better than the movie!

I think it set the stage for Buffy.

You're dealing with Duncan MacLeod of the clan MacLeod though -- a different character than Christopher Lambert's.

Here's a highlight reel with Queen:

 First the [flying cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_8mdH20qTQ) and now this.

 I don't think it was a cartoon by any stretch.  

It was more lyrical, rather than a show of force.

There's no way to beat thousands of communists oops FoxCon employees drumming away.

Anyhow.  London's closing ceremony was where the English put their true genius.  Does anybody remember Beijing's closing? 




 Yeah maybe but the timing of her visit to England and her death I think means a certain connection to a typical London disease -- she died on the voyage back home without clearing the Channel.  

Here's wiki on it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Pocahontas#Death

They cite smallpox, pneumonia or TB.  The timing adds up for those to my mind. 




 You found Trevor Hudson! 




 I've pretty much given up on reading Joel Stein's columns in Time for the same reason.  

That being said, it is fun to remember that those guys plotting the Thatcherite rebellion thought so highly of themselves.   




 You da real MVP 




 Why is nobody considering that he simply had a heart attack? 




 I live in DC and when I saw the headline in the Washington Post maybe two days saying that he was missing there, I read it as White House Chief Missing as in Chief of Staff. 




 Well the Vince Foster thing really was odd. 




 Better this than a ringbear(er). 




 I saw Les Miserables in London.  The actress singing Eponine absolutely wrecked me with On My Own.

I think she noticed and kinda gave me a half smile/wink as she exited.

I've always wondered who she was. 




 Without clicking on it, I knew it'd be True Romance.

What a great film.

Excellent choice. 




 Heh.  There's something to this.  I worked on Connecticut and L in the early 90's and as I was walking home around 6pm, the strippers for those clubs near Sign of the Whale were just coming in.  Lots of interesting early 90's fashion choices...

No clue what's going on at 6am there though. 




 What on earth makes you think /r/law gives a rat's ass about anything in Bergen County?  What state is it in, for starters.   




 I always heard typhoid, smallpox, or some other disease common to Londoners who had built up resistance, but she from the New World had not.  She died shortly after visiting London and being received by Queen Elizabeth and treated with diplomatic respect.  

Plus she and Rolfe had already had a child.  Syphilis would've prevented that, I think. 




 Cool enough.  Agreement: nbd. 




 Me, too.  My google-fu is weak, but I found this:

 I bet she knew this.

You'd think she'd wear flats to meet the president.   




 Five months ago on pics, but the rest are cross-posts.

My panties are not twisted. 




 I wonder why they arrested him in the first place?   




 The TV show was awesome from start to finish, though. 




 I agree.  I don't think BN ever fell off a cliff like the others.

There were too many iterations of evil secret organizations responsible for burning Michael, but that's forgivable for what the show was. 




 I've never seen it.  I've seen a telephone/internets cable, but not this one. 




 Shouldn't this car get ticketed on sight?

That poster's obscuring the rear view mirror's view. 




 What is the gun safety one like?  For $2 I'd buy it to mess with visitors to the house. 




 And now we know that Mrs. A. O. Teller of Honolulu came up with one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. 




 I regard the distinction as being the same as watching womens tennis.  The Williams sisters would get crushed by a male ranked in the top 200 (and did once -- he was slightly drunk, too) but they're still a lot of fun to watch.  

I saw womens Olympic matches in '96 at RFK, and this after also having seen mens WC matches there two years earlier in '94.  What struck me was that the goalie couldn't kick the ball for a clear nearly as far as a mens goalie, but I was really impressed by their athleticism.   




 Way too many spoilers in this for those of us that haven't seen it yet. 




 The woman in front has full Theda Bara make-up on.  Even back then, I can't imagine somebody would wear that to the beach. 




 I wonder about that, too.  A cat who didn't like it would run away or decapitate him.

I dunno.  Maybe this guy secretly wants to get decapitated. 




 I live in DC and listen to WTOP all the time.  In his defense, he's a radio reporter -- and a very good one at that.

My bet is what you are reading is a transcription of an item he read on air.  

Writing radio reports means brevity above all else. 




 Here's another article from the Washington Post.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/06/22/supreme-court-lets-its-nerd-flag-fly-with-comic-book-references-in-spider-man-toy-decision/

I loved the final paragraph.  She wasn't just geeking out for the sake of geeking out. 




 Please tell me this girl is now in a K-pop band. 




  kappa

What's this kappa stuff?

 




 I've never thought of the USWNT as being particularly chirpy unless somebody lets Hope Solo get near a microphone without adult supervision.

Anyhow, I have a bad feeling about this match.   




 I didn't know the Brits relegated the games to third-tier broadcasters.  Promote the matches, get them on the air where everybody can see them, and I bet the audience would grow.  I'd imagine little English girls would be just as interested as little American girls, which is the core audience that seeded interest in the '99 WC.

It seems like this is just benighted broadcasters not realizing what they have on their hands.

Speaking of which:
 in a pre-cable age the 1999 Womens World Cup

What?!  Cable was in most households by the early 80's.   




 Yeah this article is wikihole trap.  

You could read about the entire Battle of the North Atlantic given enough time.  




 The ep where the woman who'd lost her family went to NYC was one of the single best eps of anything ever filmed. 




 That was nothing compared to Toy Story 2 when Jessie gets left behind in the box at the recycling kiosk and peeks out to see her grown-up little girl driving away.

They had Sarah McLachlan singing "When She Loved Me."

Again: **Sarah McLachlan singing "When She Loved Me."** 




 Whoa!  It's Swiss?

I would've thought it was an indigenous drum from say Indonesia that I'd never heard about.

While listening to it, I did think she was using Western musical patterns though.  So at least I had that going for me. 




 Ed Grimley might be able to offer something:

 Whoa.  I always thought Kansas was almost dry and Missouri gloriously wet.  

Funny that the former dry holdout approves things faster. 




 For all the Anglo-hatred Joe Kennedy had, he sure seemed to like having the women in his family be Anglophiles. 




 "That's not how this works.  That's not how any of this works!" 




 Many thanks!

So you find yourself being able to ship to only certain states?  

Did you ever meet Battle?   




 Did you do this before the Matildas won?  If not, get thee to Vegas. 




 There's a Joe Jackson (who is English) song from I think the Mad World album, released in the late 80's where here's talking about a WWII vet who lost his leg and says "no more soccer for you!"

Whether he changed the line for the US market, I don't know.   




 States can operate in parallel to the federal government.

I read that a state contested Flying Dog's Raging Bitch.  

It's ultimately apparent that they're talking about canines so the word bitch in the context isn't pejorative.  Whatever state it was withdrew the challenge, but the feds had already let it go through.

My bet is that you need to get pre-approved for federal purposes but the states can challenge it as they see fit. 




 I love the kitten at the bottom keeping time. 




 Driving might -- might -- make sense if you drive around the Beltway and come into town from the east, but the I-66 direct route will be miserable and you might miss the show.  

Metro will be crowded but at least you'd be likely to get a seat on the way in.   




 A similar thing happened to my hometown paper during the Virginia Tech shootings -- The Roanoke Times.  None of the cable outfits could get into Blacksburg due to high winds keeping them from landing and the Times did an outstanding job breaking the story and the aftermath.   




 We got hail in Georgetown.  I picked a couple up and they're in my freezer.  One's quarter sized the other nickel

My cat was traumatized. 




 BFA! 




 Adorable little kid with the snow cone. 




 WIPE THAT SMUG SMILE OFF YOUR FACE HITLER.

 I just tuned in, looked at the score, and was all "what, did the game start at 11am?!" 




 That was terrific!  The Anderson Sisters harmony, blue T-shirt girl knowing how to dance that way... WHAT FUN! 




 Oh they do but I don't think they've ever heard of "leg day." 




 Compare and contrast to Nathan Fillion:

 Four stomachs?  I always wondered why their chests are so massive. 




 As soon as I see somebody wearing a V for Vendetta mask, I disregard them.   




 I have never understood how the Larry Niven Ringworld series hasn't been filmed. 




 You are completely mis-remembering it.

Spiro Agnew resigned as VP long before Watergate broke.

Nixon's choice to replace him was Gerald Ford, who became president upon his resignation. 




 That's not true -- Deep Throat was Woodward's source and his alone. I don't think Bernstein knew his identity until Felt announced himself.

Plus, Vanity Fair got the scoop because a Felt family lawyer handled the announcement, which resulted in the Post being scooped by someone else because Woodward and Bradlee couldn't comment until they had confirmed that Felt had come forth.  Very odd situation.   




 If you are referencing Silver Streak, I might have to say mean things on the internet.

 Whoa that's a great idea.  I wish were like the Duke basketball fans and could get everybody on the same page pre-game. 




 It was Michelle Pfeiffer's first big role, though.  I'll always thank Hollywood for that.

Never seen the movie though. 














 I didn't want to karma whore, but go the Post.  The line on top of us right now is nothing compared to the next one, which ought to be here in maybe a half hour.  It's not a derecho but it could get bumpy.

 Stachowski's occasionally has a turkey mac   cheese as a dinner special.  It's delicious.   




 He changed his jersey every inning?  How many do they have? 




 I know!  It was great to see him. 




 The next time I see Tabata coming my way, I will cross the street.  That is how angry I am. 




 I gotta say: way to go MASN for not going to commercials!

 OH NO! 




 Aspirin asperin dammit where is the aspirin?! 




 I actually got chills go down my spine  when Max took the field.  This is really something.

RENDON!!! 




 Thank you!  I saw this on /r/dc and thought "hmm, I wonder where else people might like to see this..."

Anyhow, adding some context to the story, this is in Adams-Morgan (thus the play on the bar's name), which at the time had been having a spree of pop-up electronic music dance parties occurring in unlicensed venues.   

This is what chimed in /r/dc :

 I think ABRA was concerned about the onslaught of those dance clubs that would pop up in unlicensed venues. So in order to stomp them out, they had to ding up Madam's Organ to show that they were enforcing noise violations across the board.


 









 Maybe.  I think ABRA was concerned about the onslaught of those dance clubs that would pop up in unlicensed venues.  So in order to stomp them out, they had to ding up Madam's Organ to show that they were enforcing noise violations across the board.  

Those pop up dance clubs were apparently really annoying.  

 




 I hope you've been catching him on Halt and Catch Fire.  It's a completely different vibe from Pushing Daisies -- more menacing. 









 Go down to Half Street and get your car inspected.  It's a much easier process than it used to be -- I've sailed through the past couple of years. 

Contest the ticket online.  I'd say you have a 90% chance of them waiving the ticket.   




  in the 80s

Oddly enough, 1985.  Aspen.  New Year's Eve.  My girlfriend at the time was a ski instructor.

I also met Barbara Eden on the same trip.   




 OH WOW!

Could you post the Bridges complaint?

Force gets all the press. 




 What can you possibly do when you have "DEA Agent Mark Force IV (best name ever)" in the mix. 

Poor guy.  He ran hard at these guys, then got too close to the flames. 




 Da! 
























 Yup.  I first saw her on Supernatural, where she was a demon master thief.

She rocked a posh English accent.

She looked great all washed up, too.

Her Georgian accent is OK but wanting.

 




 It's an Italian thing done to make themselves sound like singing in an American production with nobody speaking any English.

I love.  My brain keeps searching for something but can't find a phrase.

The cheat is that they use "ooh-rah" exactly where "alright" would appear.

It's a catchy tune.  Very well done.

Anyhow.  I'm still scouring this thread for non-English speakers weighing in on American accents.  Few and far between.

 I lived in London briefly and with a natural SW Virginia accent -- I had a girlfriend at the time, but oh I could sense pheremones in the air. 




 "Ma!  Where's my Red Sox hat at" was actually pretty good. 




 SW Virginia checking in.  I always associated him with Alabama, but say a public official who is over the top officious. 




 Seriously -- they're obsessive about it. 

Australia's the same way too.

The UK used to make any animal imported go into quarantine.  Fluffy the cat from NYC who'd never been outside in her life?  3 month quarantine or she's not coming in.

This is why Jonny Depp got into trouble with the Aussie with his lap dogs. 




 Family law.  Divorce gone seriously bad, I'd bet.  

What a nightmare.

The good news is that whoever did it will likely be found very very quickly.

 I'm in zone 2 and regularly leave my car in one spot for mulitiple weeks.  I don't drive very often.

OP it depends on your immediate neighborhood.

Street cleaning rarely happens unlike say NYC.  I don't think I've ever been affected by it.  DC lets Mother Nature clean the streets.  

How long it takes to find a spot is up to your immediate traffic patterns.  For me, Friday nights is the worst, but I know not to drive on Sunday mornings due to all of the churches in the vicinity.

The absolute worst is when a neighbor throws a party and hires parking attendants to valet park their guests' cars.  Every block within reasonable walking distance gets shut down.

I like having my own car.  You can easily live without one if need be though -- zipcar is quite the rage these days.  Do a cost/benefit calculation. 




 I... I... 

I don't know what to say.

Somehow I think the 420 break is on the other side of the communication. 




 I heard it was closed to tours, but could be wrong.  

There's a US Navy museum nearby that apparently is awesome.

This new bridge annoys me.  But London long ago closed off the Thames to large ships. 




 I just went digging for it and couldn't find it on WaPo -- share?

This btw sounds like something I would do.  That race was fixed. 




 There's a sad end to this story though.

Remember [Aldrich Ames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldrich_Ames#Some_CIA_sources_betrayed)?

The S.O.B. gave him up to the Soviets and he was executed. 




 England's rabies-free.  But I don't doubt they wanted to double check. 




 I get it that a debit card would get declined, but not a credit card.  Visa gives you a pre-set spending limit and you can charge up to that no matter what.

Do credit cards work differently in the EU? 




 I've always regarded Patton as being the finest biographical movie ever made.  

Ken Burns' Civil War would be the first documentary that I'd recommend. 




 I live in DC.  These polls are always crap -- we're a city of 600K crammed into a teensy space.  

It'd be like comparing Manhattan or maybe even just the Upper East Side to a state.  

Still, the city definitely runs on booze.  But also, I'd say only a third of the people in the federal government live here as opposed to the burbs of Northern Virginia and Maryland.   




 It's in the game thread under "Umpires confirm foul-ball call" -- that's exactly what I saw.   




 I didn't see it.  Perhaps an x-post? 




 There is nothing like a Harper at bat this deep in the game. 




 I'm so glad he got a curtain call.

He must be thrilled! 




 Yeah he needs to knock off the interpretive swan dance.   




 Fun fact on the thumbnail pic: a few hours later, DC got smacked by a rogue midnight T-storm, the worst since 2012, and the scouts had to flee for cover.

 What is that animal running around the car?  His doggie?  Wildlife? 




 That was some Harding administration level fixing. 




 I think they did it voluntarily. 




 I went to a wedding near Morristown in the Fall once.

I was staggered by how pretty it is.  And I grew up in the Blue Ridge -- I know something about pretty. 




 Oh is it chrome?  It looked iPod white to me on first glance.   




 Good looking torch.  It looks like they might've been influenced by Apple stylings.   




 I dunno about that.

I remember during the Vancouver Winter Olympics, Digg sent a reporter to interview alpine skier Julie Mancuso.  The format was no holds barred as there was no FCC involved, but the interview was announced 48 hours before it began so diggers could submit questions and she had to answer the top ten "digg'd" questions.  It was a wonderful interview -- she had dug in in a chalet, was wearing a cuter Russian fur hat for fun, and happily bit on the more salacious digg'd questions.  She was in her element.

I thought it was one of the single best athlete interviews I've ever seen.  

At the time, I thought that I was seeing for the first time what new media was truly capable of.  

Then Digg imploded.  

No NBC, no BBC, no whatever press operations wanting to get to her, and all they had to do was listen in for content.

IT WAS GREAT.  The single best Mancuso interview I've ever seen.

It wouldn't have been not that hard for reddit to adapt that format to LIVE AMA

Digg was ahead of its times.

Here's pic of Julie in that era:

 I never knew dogs could raise their eyebrows in all "what is this fresh hell?" 




 I ruthlessly cleared out my DVR last night.  The Buffy marathon is looking tempting. 









 I think they had a far worse fate planned than an ordinary redrum. 




 I love this skit!

The body of Pontiac with a door from an Olds 88.  

What great attention to detail! 




 I've got them on my DVR but not watched yet.  Glad to hear you like -- I've heard iffy things and frankly I thought season 1 was over-praised, Harrelson and McConnaughey's performances excepted.

I'm going to watch them and then make the decision.   




 That's the reference.

Except these cats look like they don't want to play so much a cut somebody. 




 I've seen the first two eps and while not sold on it, it's OK.

I'm toying with turning off HBO until Game of Thrones comes back though.  I wouldn't miss it.   




 Is it just me or do they look woefully underdressed for that kind of cold?  This winter was apparently one of the most brutal Europe had ever seen. 




 You can tell who's more adventurous (girl on the balcony) and who's the attention whore (girl out of pose with her knee over the windowsill), etc. 




 I think only if the /r/sports mods have had trouble with the reddit front office.  If so, absolutely.  




 Do you want to get shot by Florida Man?  This is how you get shot by Florida Man. 




 ELI5 decided not to join the protest in I think a very well-reasoned post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3by1v9/why_isnt_eli5_participating_in_the_default/

I'd think /r/dc would be wise to follow this line of thinking.

Unless of course there have been problems with the admins, but I can't see how they'd want to mess with a city subreddit.   




 It's metastasizing too -- /r/facepalm is about to go private, too.  

I hope /r/nationals doesn't.   




 I read an article about it -- nope, but they were able to splice and dice enough footage to make a usuable ad.

I always felt bad for the "sophisticated couple" extras across from him.  They had to be thrilled to be acting opposite Orson Welles... and this happens. 




 I don't know.  I bet they will.  I had a pair of 1K+ link karma links that are now in private r/'s and my total karma didn't take a hit.  This leads me to believe that they're still there, just hidden.   




 Yes.  I think once a sub goes private, comments disappear.  I'd been talking about the protest on r/videos, it went private while I was out, and they're gone now.   




 I had no idea the big /r/ mods were this alienated from the admins.  I hope this isn't our Digg 4.0 moment.  

Ohanion's not helping things, which makes me really nervous. 




 chooter got fired today and the mods of many of the default r/'s have set themselves to private in protest.  Lots of bad juju floating around right now.

Here's a pretty good summary:

 Great.  Reddit's imploding and now this.   




 I dunno.  He got the double and later scored.  That doens't totally suck. 




 I just took a 50 question test and missed only this:

3) Name one American Indian tribe in the United States.
A. Metis
B. Macedonian
C. Arawak
D. Maya

Metis never heard of, Macedonian obviously wrong, Arawak are Caribbean, so it must be Maya.

Wrong.  Arawak.  

That's not right.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arawak 




 Either that or this is the end of the road for Ellen Pao.  I hope Alex Ohanian awakes from his slumber.  

Until we know more, this could turn out to be a good thing. 




 Holy crap, this is the first I've heard of this.  What a mess:

 My thoughts exactly on the details.  I grew up in Roanoke and OP included the Star -- the huge neon Mill Mountain Star that overlooks the valley.  

http://cdn.meme.am/instances/48505750.jpg 




 This link was embedded in the description:

http://www.palestineherald.com/news/bushey-shooting-videos-released/article_34b8e3ec-1f82-11e5-9e3c-0bcf0658377a.html

The guy was an alcoholic and presumably drunk.   




 Whoa, my hometown of Roanoke in the news!  The man with a camper, wife and three teenage girls has courage.   




 That looks very Georgetown.  I feel like I've walked past it -- very familiar.  Dumbarton Street maybe?

Google dent place washington dc for Dent Place.  It's only two blocks.  I just streetviewed it but whiffed; you may have a better eye.

I'm surprised this address isn't on the web.  I hit IMDb and it turns out this building was also Diana Prince's house in Wonder Woman.   




 I swear to God that Chris Pratt is the most charming man on the planet right now. 




 They're re-doing Scream apparently.  

I don' want to watch because I know they'll never come close at all to Drew Barrymore's death sequence.

What a forgettable network.

In the 80's and 90's they were all that mattered on cable. 




 Here is the N W 611 upon being restored recently -- not too far off from this concept.

 I live in Georgetown.  This sounds right.  Google streetview Wisconsin and Dent Place and walk yourself west.

I remember they had an ep about forming up a neighborhood watch just about the same time my neighborhood was thinking about setting up a watch.  I was annoyed.  

I remember the setting was in the West Village somehow.  The West Village is different from me.  Dent Place is way up there, too.  

Anyhow OP post a screenshot and I might recognize it.
 




 DC's a tough nut to crack.  Once it does, it's wonderful.  

The single thing worst thing you can do is hole up.  

I first moved here in '85 and apparently it's still the same.  I watched a lot of TV in my first few months, then things blossomed.   




 Blech.  Rain delays + Nationals = nothing good. 




 That is the scariest fucking thing I have ever seen in my life.

Who on earth would even take possession of such a thing?!

I truly hope I'm being trolled. 




 Buffarene giveaway?  What's that? 




 I know.  Giancarlo's injury perhaps giving him pause?

 I would've been torn myself.  Wahoo by birth and degree but I really like Tech.  I would've worn Nats red instead of U.Va. orange.

 Actually, I'm American but a total Olympics geek.

I'm always mystified as to how the four sub-nations comprising the UK can't get its act together for the Olympics.  They have no problem with Scotsman Andy Murray winning the tennis gold for the UK. 




 Ooh.  You might be right.  I forgot that it's not England in the Olympics but the full United Kingdom.  

Wiki's unclear:

Edited to add:

Nope the four home associations couldn't agree.  No U.K. in the Olympics

 That was my thinking too.  It would've been nice to see say Kawasumi interviewed via translator. 




 She's got Rio to look forward to next summer, too. 




 Yeah that's the problem with getting down there for me.  Too close to fly, too far to drive. 




 My family's got a place in Litchfield.  I love it down there.  Myrtle not so much though.  

How's the weather?  Did you all get clobbered by that storm system last night? 




 I see what you did there.

 




 England just Mets out of the tourney. 




 Jesus -- 120F on the field?!  That's life threatening. 




 Quick question: in the mens WC the trainers had that magic spray can that somehow helped the players when they went down.  

How come the women don't get it and WTF is it? 




 I'm sorry I can't hear you over the sound of my air-conditioners.

 Or that freaky bald Emperor Palpatine lookalike.  That guy was great.  The Ed Hochuli of soccer. 




 I get the distinct impression FIFA's having problems finding WC-class refs who aren't American.   




 Crap call for Japan, then a make-up for England.

I have no problem with this. 




 I've both Metro'd and driven out of crowded Nats games.  Via car, once you're out of the vicinity of the stadium, it's fine.  

I'd imagine getting across the South Capitol Street bridge would be a snap.   




 Whoa.  Italy without pasta and tomato sauce.  Must've been a bummer to live there back then.

I wonder why the Italian cuisine went in that direction and the rest of Europe didn't.  Maybe it's easier to grow tomatoes in Italy? 




 Consider that the tomato is indigenous to South America.  

The great Italian recipes with tomato sauce?  They didn't exist until well after Columbus.   




 Excellent!  The airlines with all their consolidation over the past decade have become an old boys club.  I bet this is just the beginning of something bigger. 




 They replaced the entire grid in Georgetown in 2001-2002.  It was a massive pain -- the power was intentionally shut off for a night every month or so.

But, the power hasn't gone off since.  Derecho, hurricanes, snowpocalypse -- nothing.   









 It is SO cool seeing those highlights without the announcers play by play. 




 Junior High School, perhaps '74.  There was something amajigger that could compute.  It mystified me but I could see was cool.

I didn't have access to a mainframe until college, perhaps '81.

I thought they were cute diversions until I saw a spell check program work on a laptop in '85.  That's when I knew the world had changed. 




 Relax.  The same thing's been going on since the founding of the Republic.

The news cycle makes it worse and more pronounced, but don't forget that people can only vote every 2 years.  

Sometimes, the country gets together but that's not normal. 




 I was hoping to annoy inter-disciplinary redditors, but

 Holy crap, is that really happening?!

They're in the East Room for the night, I'd bet. 




 Ah, then I might've slept through the 2012 midnight T-storm.  I just don't remember thunder   lightning like this post-midnight.

No question that this was nowhere close to the dercho.   




 Whoa.  autowkibot patrols /r/Nationals?  

This is something.  What this something is, I dunno. 




 I was.  Are you referring to the derecho?  That happened much earlier in the night.   




 Holy crap.  She was at 21 the youngest FLOTUS.

Somehow, I don't think we'll ever see that record beaten. 




 I've got an 18 pound short-haired orange tabby who is the largest cat I've ever encountered. 

Is this a domestic cat or a lynx or something?  Perhaps you are petite? 




 Well, in the Coolidge administration, yes.

Very odd choices by the Nats with their POTUS's.  

They seem to be stocking up on post-Teddy pre-FDR characters, and now we get the great Prohibitionist? Not good for beer sales on South Capitol. 




 Where the heck did this storm come from?  Normally we get clobbered like this in the hours immediately following sunset.

I don't remember a non-hurricane storm in the middle of the night like this. 









  thanks to Title IX 

That's all anybody needed to read. 




 A Brit nailing Valley Girl vocal fry?!  

Like, very impressive. 




 I don't think it's fair to tie the Packers to this guy.  It doesn't look like they had any warnings of his behavior.

 




 John Locke is overrated. 




 Oddly enough, just last week I saw the first sensible defense of that ending.

The reason he became a lumberjack was because as a child in that container, he saw his mother murdered via chainsaw.

So he picked up up a vocation that uses chainsaws to expunge the horror.

It still sucked, but maybe less so now. 




 Oh yeah, of course the tree canopy changes every decade or so.  But I know there are still trees in that spot on the Capitol grounds -- you'll notice they're slightly north of the Senate wing.  It's pretty green along the sides of the Mall.  


Dunno how well this link will work, but it appears the construction site is probably where that pic was taken from, but you'll notice trees just west of it:

 Not a definitive answer, but I remember reading something maybe two years ago that kale supposedly has more nutrients than other leafy greens such as spinach.

I have hated kale since boyhood and still do.  I can't wait for this fad to die. 




 Hodor! 




 I might accept that challenge.  But it'd be a little underwhelming -- I too live in DC and all of the ones I recognized are the same.

That pic of the White House threw me a little bit though.  I think the portion that's got the trees on the roof is actually the East Wing, which is now the First Lady's base of operations and the main actual entrance to get into the White House.  They must've have a promenade on the roof back then.

The West Wing wasn't built until the 30's or so.

The Castle, the Capitol, Treasury, what was then the State   War Department and is now the Eisenhower Building -- they all look exactly the same.

I don't recognize the Printing   Engraving Building or the Pension Office.  They may have been razed since these were taken.   




 Before tuning out -- OP that was a TERRIFIC play by play up there! 




 Here is NBC's Leigh Diffey broadcasting F1 from Monaco:

 What is that buzzing noise that sounds like an aircraft engine? 




 That's been in the back of my mind since the soccer halftime. 




 Dagger for the USA!!! 




 I am.  This is almost certainly going to decide the championship -- Germany/USA are both considered stronger than England or Japan.  

It's not a bad game so far.  They're duelling each other.   




 Not entirely true.  Royal Navy operations had to be suspended in the North Atlantic, which is what the US was mostly angry about.

Yes the White House got burned, but that was it.  The Brits had to pull out of DC a day later.  Hardly the capital being razed.  

It was an unpopular war that resulted in a stalemate.  I've always viewed it as settling remaining contentions from the Revolution. 




 Give it a better wingspan and it looks very much like Lilienthaler's pioneering gliders.

 John C. Flood got me out of a serious heating problem a few years ago.  I really like that company.

This is the OP here, folks.

I saw it a few nights ago in r/pics

https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3beutv/this_is_what_a_320_bacon_and_egg_roll_from/ 




 Me too.  Nats fan here who has the game on in the kitchen whenever I'm home, half-paying attention to it.   




 I saw this photo pop up elsewhere.  Is this confirmed to be Gates?

He was born in '55, appears to be ten or so here, which makes this photo in '65.  This photo looks like it's from the 70's -- color, that style of bike, the way he's dressed.   




 Bingo.  As soon as I saw a trailer for The King's Speech, I thought blatant Oscar bait.

It was a perfectly charming movie though. 




 How could they possibly be smiling after a day like they'd had? 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyssa_sylvatica 




 DAE think this is kind of douchey? 




 I grew up in the 70's and those Schwinn banana seat bikes were a must for any boy of the era.  I get incredibly nostalgic anytime I see one.   




 You're the redditor running it?  It looks promising.  

I love tracking the bids. 




 I didn't know https://www.reddit.com/r/olympicgamesbids existed.  

Subscribed!

Interesting to see Switzerland interested in hosting even a youth games.  

 




 Here it is over Washington, DC:

 Lucky Bar.  It's the go-to soccer bar. 




 Love it! 




 I was in my garden and watching the radar loops on the Post so I knew full well it was coming.

When it hit, I dived back into the kitchen and kind of had caveman-level terror.  I have never heard the tree canopy make that kind of sound, not even in a hurricane.  

Anyhow, I never get tired of that Jefferson Memorial video linked in the article.   




 I dunno about that.  I walk past that house once or twice a month and only now noticed that it has a basement level.  Three story house on Olive Street and abutting Rose Park?  $1.1M actually sounds like a steal.

Good luck finding a parking spot nearby though. 




 50% idiot + 50% too much gin last night. 









 I've lived in Georgetown for 25 years and don't recognize them.  My bet is that it -- not surprisingly -- came from upstream on the Potomac. 














 It's more that that issue just now popped up as a leading article on washingtonpost.com.  

I wonder if somebody's trying to send a signal or just foster chaos.

It's weird.  I knew PR was having financial difficulties but they have been for years.

*edit: OK now I see that their bonds mature on July 1st every year.  My panties are no longer twisted.* 




 To my mind, the leading clubs are the Metropolitan and the University clubs.  Cosmos Club is more merit-based.  

I've never been attracted to the club culture though.  

The City Tavern Club is the only one I truly considered joining.

Don't join National Press unless you're a journalist.  I love that space though.  Many happy evenings spent there.  If you are a journalist, snap it up. 




 The timing of this makes me wonder if it's a real crisis or somebody trying to scramble the markets before Wall Street opens tomorrow morning. 




 I love it when the Millenials embrace historic local music.

This vid reminds me of this:

 Stalin + engineering + possibility of certain death?  Yikes.

Edit b/c I was warned by the bot: at what point do these people go "oh hell no!" and let these systems become obsolete.  

And at what point did the Soviets think this was a good idea?  Terrifying their comrades who are simply trying to commute? 




 "You're coming with me and if you forget the frisbee this time, I will cut you." 




 Have you ever ticketed somebody for chewing gum?

I spent a night at the Raffles once, pre-modernization.  Ever taken a call there?  

 














 You didn't watch it all the way through, did you?

Some of the creepiest stuff on YouTube starts with something innocuous to keep the censors away.  This is a classic example. 




 "rebuked in Dubuque" -- better than "Banned in Boston"!

Anyhow, this is like Florence Jenkins, a notoriously unaware horrible opera singer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjURO9L5fdc 









 Why do weekdays?  Fun fact that nobody seems to know: parking is free on Sundays in Georgetown.  Come in, walk/bus to Foggy Bottom, and the Metro is yours.

I drive from SW Virginia to DC all the time, which means the full length of I-66.  It's not difficult. 




 That was the moment I realized Community had gone from smart to sublime. 




 My favorites were his musical cold openings.   




 I came to the show late an that took me forever to grasp.  The occasional references to the Soviets still existing threw me for a loop.   




 Some can, and well.  Max Scherzer of the Nats is doing very well.   




 FYI this was a joking reference to Nixon's possible return post-Watergate: "He's tanned, rested, and ready." 




 I live in DC and pretty much grew up without baseball.  When the Nats came to town, I started to really get into it.  I remember that just about the time I understood what an opposite field homerun was that I really began to enjoy it.

Now the Nats are awesome and watch or listen to pretty much every game.   




 I just finished the Mr. Robot pilot.  Financial market meltdown imminent.  So, basically I'd be living in Athens in real life. 




 Excellent choice!  Classic moment in TV history.  With all the hype around Survivor that summer, it was basically the show sticking the landing.

 Those of us in DC will never recover from the Nats' NLDS collapse against the Cardinals.

One strike away from winning the series, and...

 I read that it had to do with wanting to avoid Apple's liabilities.  He didn't want to be held responsible for any debt or something. 




 Aqua 301 is really nice.  I bet they do brunch but look them up. 




 The poor boat was sunk in Singapore and raised.  Complete agreement with everybody that if she were still sea-worthy, we should be all in on preserving her.

But she already sank.  It's hard for a vessel to come back from that. 




 Patton.  

George C. Scott gets all the press for his rightly-earned accolades, but when you take a step back, it's the absolute best biographical film ever made.  There was some love and effort in getting the script right.

DDL's Lincoln and MLK in Selma should've done the same but screwed things up.

I also think Patton's one of the best war films ever made. 




 Yup.  They wouldn't let her do the full bikini thing -- her butt would've been much sleeker, like modern beauties.  

The corset thing sort of hid it, but when you see her move, it does look like she was wearing a diaper.

The ep I saw had something to do with the rescue of a scientist with a secret potion.  Diana loved kicking a Nazi's ass once as Wonder Woman.  She was actually in danger in this ep.

Roddy McDowall did Wonder Woman?!
 




 George King of Falafel.  28th   M.  They might let you eat al fresco if you ask nicely. 




 Yup.  She was mad about the padding throughout the filming.

I recently saw an ep on a OTA alternate channel for nostalgia sake where she rescued a crazy scientist or something.  She looked weird with the bikini bottom stuffed like that.  This was the same era of Charlie's Angels so I don't know why she was made to do this. 




 I do!  DirecTV with an over-the-air add-on and a woefully maxed-out DVR.  

Bonus: it's hooked up to a CRT television.

I can't stand watching TV over the internets.  Lower quality, horrible sound, etc.  

Mind you the only thing I watch live are sports or the occasional season finale.  Sometimes reality TV eps in order to bitch   moan live online.  

Edit: Plus live newscasts -- you can't beat live TV when a hurricane or blizzard is in the mix. 









 Breaking Bad, easily.  I watched the pilot as it first aired.  It had been getting favorable pre-reviews across the board.  I have DirecTV so it wasn't even in HD at the time, which might have made WW's tightie whities a little easier to take.  Had I seen them in HD I might've bailed.

2nd choice would be Buffy.  I fudge on the rules a little though: the first ep I saw is what turned out to be the S1 finale, however, S1 was a half-season.  They re-ran that half season in order over the summer, I watched or VCR'd each ep and then launched into S2 without missing a beat.

I plead forgiveness for fudging as this was the late 90's. 




 What is it with cute Korean girls and impossibly complicated first pitches?

 Who the heck gets booked for rolling through a stop sign + apparently expired license? 




 Pre-nups are fine for second marriages when there are children in the mix.  They're effectively a component of estate planning.

For first marriages they're a crock.   




 The LSE in London has one of these.  I never had the courage to go over the top. 




 I know.  

The last five minutes was the most fun I've had watching soccer since the mens WC.  

Gotta hand it to England.  They were getting shelled and defended beautifully.   




 Many thanks! 

I can't believe I was right in remember it was Jacoby.  

Great sleuthing.  




 As if anybody needs a new reason to hate the Phillies. 




 My first thought, too.  I loved how he wound up interviewing the construction crew and dedicating the broadcast to them.  He had absolutely nothing to do with his air time. 




 I know you can't have them in Nats Park, at least the last time I asked. 




 I give it 10 more minutes. 




 There was an ad for I think TV's with one of the Redskins original Hogs -- (Joe Jacoby?) -- who upon being introduced responds with an incredibly flat "and yes."  

My google-fu is weak.   




 Call ahead and let them know what you're doing.  I've never witnessed one myself, but the myth is that they flip over this happening.   




 I wuz just trying to say he wearing exactly what a white guy collegiate player would wear unless he didn't bite on the elaborate fashion-forward/fashion-disaster route.  If he'd come from a preppy school and been selected by the Jazz especially.  

He needed his persona to be credible, nailed it, and funzies began. 




 There was some sort of a governor on the turret that wouldn't let them fire when the gun was pointed at the tail.  

They had an onboard communication link with the pilot though, so they'd tell him to cut one way or another and square off of on the attacking aircraft.

These beasts could outdive anything though. 




 I know how to adjust volume levels.  I could've nailed it and handed the iPod off to the real musicians. 




 The Titanic pic made me laugh.

I normally hate this kind of thing, too. 




 These are all journalistic interns.  They're running to get the copy of the decision to their network's/magazine's/newspaper's legal analysts.  

It's a grand tradition.   




 Dayum whoever took that pic has got an AWESOME security clearance!

I like how the rainbow is over the Supreme Court building. 




 Cocktail, a Tom Cruise chickflick.

My gf made me go, I went, but spent the middle part of the movie patrolling the condiments stand.
