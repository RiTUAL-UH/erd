 this night, I think Vincentini actually played poorly   he wasn't really given a chance to right himself. He's been better than folks have given him credit 
























 I don't see what it matters. Seems a topic simply meant to keep old wounds open 

















































 @train_subject1405 









 A USL team in St. Louis would be welcomed by so many, the city wants a pro team. But I gotta hope for Milwaukee, that's a market to crack 







































 This thing looks like a Poppler from Futurama 

















































 if the Atlanta Silverbacks brand isn't bought by Blank   a wholly new team is plopped down in the city, then I'll see this as a American soccer failure. we need more teams but we need more teams where there aren't already teams. Anyway. I think buying the brand like the Sounders, Timbers, Whitecaps,   Impact all did would be the best route 




 if your group can't regulate itself then it'll get regulated by the league. every real   vibrant supporter group keeps its own house in order. 




 I'm so very sick of seeing NFL involved with soccer 













































































































 there's a tiny conceptual field called "pataphysics" which is a kind of fake or speculative physics/naturalism. A "metageography" or "patageography" field would be cool 



















 I'd love to see this kind of stuff done with other fantasy worlds--like Robert Jordan's or Terry Brooks' 




 Carolina are always a team that finds a way to win. Discounting them is a bad idea. 




 I didn't subscribe   I'm able to click the link to the full article. sorry it's not working for you 




 Ibarra, Bracalello, Takada 




 here's hoping you see a win!  




 I keep trying to get into this show but it's just not sticking 




 I agree. These look forgettable. The lack of red surprises. I think these kits just ousted Edmonton's for the most bland in the league

 I'm on the fence about that away kit. But like the home kit, a nice compliment to Feyenoord  




 got it. I thought as much but just wanted confirmation. thx! 




 is the rule that one individual owner has to be worth 20mil or one part of the ownership group? 




 there are couple of quality clubs in the NPSL that could make the jump in the next few years--the Tulsa Athletics among them 




 Wall flag(s) would be cool. Loon call. Beer/bottle cozy. I'm a sucker for well designed polos. I'd love to be able to buy the some of the training gear I saw last season. I need new pint glasses! 




 Both of these are jokes, but it's chum given how much these 'rankings' ignore the actual standings 




 the team's tour in England may not involved big name teams (Derby the exception), but the interactions training-wise and the press attention can only improve the team's rep   quality. I wish more MLS/NASL teams did this sort of thing (in England, Spain, Italy, wherever) in the preseason 




 this will certainly give Edmonton more edge in attack. FCE will be a much faster team this season 




 that's a defense of mostly fullbacks. I have concerns about Ft. Lauderdale's defense 




 well, that's ridiculous. but I'm sure it will be fun 




 it's an interesting structure. wouldn't it be great if it could be harnessed by actually good writing 




 this is disappointing news 




 right? I thought it'd be a comic piece, but no 




 After Yallop saying that the team is still slightly over the cap, I suspect that Piermayr may not be signed   that Kinney will be let go--but that's pure speculation 




 Cochrane's a leftback so I would imagine that this pick up puts pressure on Jumper more than Kinney. But it's good to see Yallop getting pieces to be Segares' replacement. 




 more pro teams in Canada is always a good thing 




 I feel like this is too narrative--I'd rather see it told descriptively from the first person. Good draft tho 




 large population and given that Texas is huge   people in general aren't too keen on driving four hours round trip it seems to have just as much a chance as any other potential market 




 Cardenas sounds like someone who'd compliment Ibarra well. Nimani, Bah,   Jordan sound like perfect fits for NASL 




 this is a great chance for the Dark Clouds to expand the MNUFC fan base 




 NPSL season is summer only, set to occur during the collegiate off-season 




 I have to wonder, if the question was money, why not dump Soumare? 




 still with the stripes that aren't really hoops but it looks like a training top more than a home kit 




 Perhaps my feelings will change when I see it on the players. I doubt. This looks like a joke design. 




 simple, direct, bright without any distractions 




 I've really enjoyed the Colorado jerseys the last couple of seasons but I'm a sucker for burgundy  




 Chivas, like its jersey, is forgettable and little changed 




 clean, bright white is always a winner 




 looks less like a fun-run prize tshirt than last season's kit. But still rather bland. Still...so much better than Chicago's 




 that home kit is sweet looking, one that I wouldn't hesitate to just wear out 




 I think that's a fair assessment. And one the writer of the article makes in an oblique way--Rios just never gelled with Chicago   therefore didn't produce 




 I like this song   think the chorus could work well 




 A couple more investors, steady growth,   this team could be in USL or NASL within a season or two 




 think the consensus with Fire supporters is that Ward is a must-have. Joya   Pineda might have break out seasons this year if they stay healthy 




 Hope Townsend catches on with another team soon. But he may be a good fit with the NASL or USL, play a season there to show MLS teams that he doesn't just have talent but can produce if played 




 if that's it, I'm good with it 




 Stahl has plenty of experience   would be a good signing for San Antonio; Polak could become a very good fullback in NASL (the way Austin Da Luz became a better wide mid); I remember Collins John when he was with Chicago Fire, awful 




 I wonder about the Rust Belt Cup 




 team still needs more defensive depth but this is a good pick up 




 I would contend that Anangono's success will be tied to the strength of his strike partner   the quality of service he gets from the center of the midfield--those aspects could be out of his control   thus lead to some stalling 




 It'll be bittersweet if Anibaba has a 'breakout' season as suggested as well--I want him to do well but it will be frustrating seeing him excel at a position where Frank I refused to play him 




 It would have been nice if the Eddies would've played Victoria or even Thunder Bay. The Canadian PDL teams have done well 




 unfortunate to hear but it's good to know the reasons--improving grounds with the intention of returning, think that's acceptable at the D4 lvl 




 I hope there's truth to it. it'd be great to see more young   prime aged players being drawn to the league. finally dispel that retirement league stigma 




 thanks for the info on that 




 I think it's ridiculous to expect sellout for every game. A 15k avg in a 20k stadium? That's just fine; think we all need to re-adjust our attendance expectations. And yeah, Chicago can definitely handle another team 




 yeah, wow, kinda feel like something went awry there. hopefully Atlanta got some compensation or perhaps Horth wasn't signed-signed 




 still wishing for Duval County FC 




 Looking at the Eastern Conference, it feels like Montreal   Chicago are the weakest teams 




 this team feels like it's in statis, not worse than last season but not really any better. Hopefully the preseason will suggest some sparks but I doubt. I have a pessimistic view of the upcoming season 




 maybe grow over time but any colonists born on this imaginary colony would develop from birth differently. If they arrived back on Earth, then would perhaps find themselves stronger 




 I've been loving your designs, but this one is just awful. I dig the sash in kits but stars are nearly always a fail for me. Still--love what you're doing 




 thought it was nice to see another outlet giving these teams some coverage 




 I thought this was an excellent example of what happens when we focus too much on league vs league instead supporting teams. I've always thought it weird that as a supporter I'm expected to be a cheerleader for the leagues where the teams I support play. To my mind, this is the same kind of reasoning I see in MLS homers. I'd rather not see it at all. but I thought sharing it could open up a good conversation that wasn't crazy

 that's only five defenders for Tampa now. I have concerns about their defense going into the 2014 season 




 sure thing! just did 




 I like their signings, giving them some real options to pull the team up the ranks 




 I feel he needs a partner that's not a target man style kind of striker. Ambersley feels like an opportunity creator for a pocher or solid finisher. He could be an assists machine with the right partner. I don't think he had the right kind of partner in MN with Campos. 




 also remember, that the stream counts these pass few years fluctuated as people switched to other matches or just tuned out (and maybe came back). This way viewers will have a psychological incentive to stay watching   it could lead to a dedicated means for bars to stream matches 




 this would be an excellent premise for a slim book 




 It would seem everything will revolve around quality of stream. Having spent years dealing with pirate links to watch matches that MLS Live blacked out and the teams I like over in Europe, I'll gladly pay $5 to the league for a consistent quality stream. I would like it to be free but I also want the league to nurture a revenue line. 




 Well, no. I still am enamored with mapmaking and creating cities/nations and landscape. So I'm interested in fantasy that is its own world but that just doesn't have magic
 




 I guess I was thinking of a book that is set in another world but that obeys natural laws like our own. not an alternate history per se 




 Gulley was dreadful with Atlanta on loan last year. Dreadful. But he's still quite young so I too hope he gets his shit together. I'd love to see Atouba stake his claim for the left winger spot 




 Franco looks like a good pick but I don't see it as anything more than a lateral move. The team still has red flags at fullback (both sides) and the wings 












































 It does seem like a break even exchange, but who knows maybe a new venue is exactly what each player needed. I could also see Saiko landing with Carolina or maybe Tampa 

















































































































































































































 Wasn't Calgary on track to have a team before the floods up there derailed everything? 



















 the NASL site will also have a stream 


































 let's treat this with a bit of skepticism until the league makes a clear, decisive statement. Hartford is really dodgy when it comes to construction   this could all just be bluster. A bit like the "New England Force" promotion that never became anything of note. But it would be great if it were true. 














 Really good piece, thx! 




 Fucking glorious 




 either one, we know what you mean. but they team has a cute video to familiarize folks: http://www.mnunitedfc.com/news/detail/lang/EN/uuid/xk6nrcjhfz04187qeroqw1nya/rules-of-soccer--explaining-the-beautiful-game-simply#.U7cAdfldWSo 









 oh, and NASL offers a cheap online stream for all teams in the leage 




 Every MN United home game is on local tv, keep an eye out for them 




 I too feel rather squishy and uncomfortable about it. a couple of years ago I wrote a piece on the evangelical soccer clubs here in the US (http://soccernewsday.com/usa/a/198/faith-based-soccer). It's murky waters whenever religion comes into play but I think there's definitely a place for it because, ironically enough, truly faithful athletes are less hypocritical in their play   conduct. At least, that's my take 




 I will back every Queen song used 





































































 that's sweet bit of trivia 




 I hope the article didn't seem too rambling or spiteful, thanks for reading 




 For some they are one and the same 




 I toyed with putting Borges in the squad as a playmaker for Maradona but then thought that might be too meta...or silly... 




 Aw, man, I really enjoy this club. Love to see them in NASL 






















































 I like the sky blue it's a nice connection to the Kicks   Thunder but I do wish that the blue was darker, closer to the MN Stars/NSC Stars blue 





























 there is less violence in this show (first season at least) than any of the major network dramas 


































 I think it will, #3 will come out June 11th. But I agree with you, there's a lot happening on each page unlike the more direct narrative of Saga. I wrote a review of the first two issues for The Stake, if you're interested.  




 I've just gotten into Saga as well. I've found the new series Shutter to be similar 




 It was nice to know Takada was in the mix. From the stream, it sounded like most were dissatisfied with Daley's lax attempts to get back to defend 


































 Basso is the only player here I've seen play--he was with USL's Harrisburg City Islanders the last few years. Nice to see him picking up with a higher division, not a bad defender 




 it's really negotiated in each case. a team can loan a player for a set time (month, three months, six months, whole season) and with a clause that they can be re-called at any time or not. The USL is operating more akin to MLB's minor league system wherein players are movee up and down virtually at will of parent club 














 I'm sure it's coming, lots of stuff in the queue  




 thx for this Bree! 




 you're completely correct--the league is huge (especially with the new wave of expansion) and often information/stats comes down to the individual teams themselves. what's unfortunate it that there's a lot of work to do but not enough funds to hire folks to do it--getting better though. 




 huh. that's weird. wish I had better info for you but I'm sure they'll sort it out for ya. the folks Ive talked to have always been itching to help 




 I've not had any problems. You've gone here:http://mnunited.row27clients.com/ 




 I've got some concerns about this 'reserves' squad. They've pummeled Eau Claire and I fear that it will only be a keeping fitness club for the first team and not quite the development club I was hoping  




 NPSL isn't too good at posting real time information or updating its site, it's an area that they really need to improve upon 




 here's the roster according to the NPSL: http://www.nationalpremiersoccerleague.com/teams/64214691/65998048-64214780/TEAM.html 




 not my article, but I thought it worth sharing because there could be some fun discussion about how good/bad the list was. At least you locked down the fuck-face troll angle. 





























 Midfield was poor all around. I don't know if I'd hack that much on Manny, but the plan for the evening was definitely misguided 
























 my mistake, the chicken should be part of Step 4 









 Ingredients

1.5 cups of quinoa

1 can of chicken (5 ounces)

broccoli (optional)

2 minced cloves of garlic (about two teaspoons)

2 eggs

cup of milk

at least 1.5 cups of shredded cheddar (I tend to bump this up to 2-2.5 cups)

2-4 tablespoons of sriracha (or a quarter cup)

optionalsprinkle panko for topping.

 

Instructions

1. Briefly saute your veggies. In this case, its broccoli and garlic.

2. Cook the quinoa. I like using a rice cooker to do this.

3. Preheat oven to 350 F. Butter or spray your casserole dish, a 139 works best, make sure its relatively deep like an inch and a half or so.

4. Whisk eggs and milk in a large bowl. Throw in the quinoa, most of the cheese (youll want to have some cheese remaining to sprinkle on the top as it all bakes), sriracha, chicken, and veg and mix well. 

5. Pour into casserole dish. Sprinkle remaining cheese or panko over the top and bake for 30-35 minutes. Once the cheese/panko is brown, its ready to be pulled out and serve.

 more annoyed with a criteria that creates a backline of three centerbacks and a rightback, feel it lends itself to unnecessary confusion 









 And, if you're interested, a friend of mine is pursuing more work in area: https://experiment.com/projects/why-the-long-face-functional-morphology-of-a-unique-fossil-porpoise 












































 I can't help but see him as a perfect CAM, when he's pushed out wide he can still excel but the probability of him being ineffectual rise for the reasons mentioned in the article 






































































































































 I like how Dos Santos is committed to the 4-3-3, but I don't think that the Fury have the midfield linchpin it needs--Donatelli   Ubiparipovic have been good all season but the team needs an anchor 





























 BBQ Chickpea Burgers, http://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2014/08/29/foodiesphere-bbq-chickpea-burgers/

Like most recipes of mine, this is modified. I cant stand vegans (at least when they talk about being vegan) but there are some great vegan recipes out there that can easily be altered to be real people food.

 

Ingredients

can of chickpeas/garbanzo beans

1/4 cup sunflower seeds

1/4 cup flax seeds

1/4 sesame seeds

2 eggs

2 cloves of garlic

1 red pepper

1/2 red onion

1 carrot (or about 12 baby carrots)

1 cup of BBQ sauce

1-1.5 cups of Panko

 

Step 1: Finely chop the garlic, pepper, onion, carrot, and chickpeas. I used a small food processor. You want it to look kinda goopy and it will be wet. I did the veg first, put it into a large bowl, and then did the chickpeas second mixing the two together in the bowl.

Step 2: Once the veg and chickpeas are well mixed, throw in the BBQ sauce, Panko, eggs, and seeds. Mix these all together. Add more Panko (or breadcrumbs) if you feel you need to thicken it.

Step 3: I have an old George Foreman grill that I use for burgers because I dont have an outdoor grill and I despise pan frying. Roll up the mixture into balls only slightly larger than a golf ball. Plop them down on the grill and let them flatten and cook. Maybe 3-5 minutes for each group or until theyre nice and brown on the outside.

You could probably bake these in an oven as well. Guess would be 350 degrees on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil for 15-25 minutes flipping them at least once so theyre brown on both sides.


This should make between 10-15 patties. I would estimate the prep time at around 15 minutes   the cook time at between 20-25. I found eating three to be very filling. 









 it's not looking good for them   even worse for their chances of turning their season around 




 hope it's useful. I'm trying to make it a regular thing so we all can keep tabs on teams we may not follow 




 not much at all really, he's been mostly been a bench option this Fall.  














 I really don't see an issue here. Also think terming buying into MLS as a 'defection' is needlessly adversarial 




 I think you could ask a slew of self-identifying libertarians   they would distance themselves from liberalism. But I can see you're point, though it doesn't really seem to add anything to the author's purpose 



















 I don't think anyone is trying to be malicious or abusive of the rules, just a reminder will do   let us all continue to enjoy content we might not have found on our own 




 "I can't believe the ref allowed San Antonio to throw himself at our 'keeper. Just goes to prove the Scorpions play rugby while we play real soccer." --Faux Wynalda 









 Jake Nutting will be covering as much of the Rowdies as possible for "12," so I'm sure there will be more positives coming 





































































 I like seeing a list like this but I'm resistant to MLS reserve teams being part of it (affiliate teams, fine, but the reserves feels kinda bs-y) 




 sorry, didn't see the overlap. thx for the catch 







































 did you see that match where MNU had white socks? Not okay. But I at collars.  









 what about a third kit that tries to revamp the retro kit of the Minnesota Kicks the team had? 




 32 would be a nice change up but I'd still want the away to be blue 










































































 perhaps it's only a blip, but I've concerns about the declining attendance in Ft. Lauderdale 









 Detroit City FC use this as their anthem. It'd be nice to get a local tune in the chant rotation--something Replacements maybe, Doomtree 















































































 watching it over again, most of the ball is over the line as it rolls along but it never completely goes over. I think it was the right call but Eddies are completely justified in being miffed, that goal would've changed the game entirely 









 Pasher looked to be more of a leftwinger/forward in those highlights, which was mostly of his time in Finland's 3rd tier. I think he played for Lansing United this year in the NPSL. Great video finds 
























 well, I play chess rather poorly   love beer (Untappd: danielcasey). I'd be up for it 









 where were you thinking of doing this? 




 love this crest, the dry-fit shirts are screaming to be rec league jerseys 

















































 Adversaries Together is the first book in a planned seven book series I began last November as part of National Novel Writing Month. Check it out and look for book two to appear soon!

Check it out here: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_awdm_EUOxub05HQ5T3

"A city that's been under siege for a thousand days. A rising empire and a power hungry religion. A resource so precious that its production controls the world. In the world of Syr Nebra, there is no such thing as magic, yet every human clings to their faith and country. Avery Roth is a wanderer scratching out a living in the hinterlands trying to avoid the religious zealots of The Cathedral and the imperial ambitions of The Seven Spires. But when a young woman and her paladin guardian literally run into him in the wild as they are fleeing bandits, he is entangled in a political web that tightens the more he struggles to free himself and others."

 have we completely ruled out the team selling the rights to the name to the MLS team that's coming in?  






























































































 Unlike being an agent, referee, or coach, there doesn't seem to be a process for becoming a proper scout. It gives the impression of being haphazard. Being a scout needs to be more than gut feeling or impression. But I don't feel that it's more than watch several players in a region, take deep notes, record video, conduct interviews, and report back...which honestly would be a job I would love to have
 





























 agreed, Palmer's quality is that of a back-up who's starting because the team has zero options 




 did you see that Wired article from a couple months ago? Always, it seems: http://www.wired.com/2014/08/wuwt-typos/ 




 went through   did some cleaning up. sorry it was rough, I just wrote it   posted 









 I like to think myself and wife are a bit responsible for Kansas going into the MNUFC column  




















































































 Keep: Shipp, Nyarko, Earnshaw, Johnson,   Segares. Get rid of the rest by any means necessary 




 that might be where I found it originally, I tend to make this with more cheese   garlic pepper than usual 




 usually I would as well, but this is among my 'what's left in my pantry' recipes 




 depends on how liberal you are with the sriracha. mine are low, just a calm warmth 









 Ingredients

1 can of black beans (16 oz.)

1 red bell pepper

A third of a cup of scallions or green onions

3 cloves of garlic

1 egg

1 tablespoon of cumin

1.5 cups of quick oats

A third of a cup of sesame seeds

A third cup of sriracha

Directions

1) Rinse and drain the black beans. If youd like, mash them up.

2) Chop up the bell pepper into manageable pieces that can be put into a food processor. Toss the pepper, onion, garlic, and beans into the food processor and chop it all up. Then add the egg, oaks, sesame seeds, cumin, and sriracha and mix it all together.

3) Dump the food processor mixture into a bowl. Add more oats if necessary to thicken up the mixture. If you want to have a firmer mixture to form into patties, put the bowl into the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

4) Put a piece of wax paper on a cookie sheet (aluminum foil would work as well). Dole out the mixture into dollops that form patties of about two inches wide maybe half an inch thick.

5) Bake these at 375 degrees for at least 10 minutes.

 Artichoke Chicken
Ingredients
1 can of artichoke hearts (15 oz.)
1 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese
1 cup of mayonnaise
1 tablespoon of garlic pepper
1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or tenders)
Directions
1) In a medium sized bowl mix all the ingredients together.
2) Once the ingredients are all mixed, set the bowl aside. Take the chicken and cut it up into strips. Lay the chicken out evenly in the dish.
3) Then spread the mixture in the bowl over the top of the chicken. Preheat oven should to 375, bake uncovered for at least 30 minutes

 yeah, the kid probably isn't much more than a bench option for the remainder of the season. he could bloom in the league though. Question is, just how much development time did he lose being wasted with Chicago 




 exactly, Tampa Bay has plenty of forwards. So many, in fact, that it often pushes them out of position out wide where they are ineffectual--this, of course, merely a casual opinion 


































 Did you guys know about this Minnesota United merch via the Admiral website? Just discovered it. The black polo and training tops look tough
http://admiral.axissoccer.com/admiral_en/catalog/category/view/id/121?club=4 




 a little too Silverbacks   Scorpions looking for my tastes 




 a third kit would be fun, a Kicks throwback 









 I had similar worries. After next season's expansion teams (Jax, OKC), the league is going to have to focus entirely on the Pacific timezone. I think USSF's insistence may over-saturate the West coast. But really, I have a hard time coming up with viable locations--maybe Tacoma (the Milwaukee of Washington State), Nevada feels like a black hole, San Diego could work, there have been rumors of San Francisco, Fresno would have a nice population but the city is so very poor, and the rest of southern California is a crap shoot. 

I'd rather see investment in places like Omaha, Calgary, El Paso, Albuquerque, Hamilton, and Detroit. Well, it'll be fun to see what happens 




 to the USL question: no, the standards to operate an USL club are much much lower than NASL. USL will not be D2 any time in the foreseeable future 







































 yes, the egg fluffs it up a bit 














 well, Mendes and Bracalello are more wingers. And Polak   Pridham aren't really ready for primetime. But Burgos is most certainly the real deal, so that gives us three top choices which I feel is the minimum necessary for a top team 




 but without Campos, depth at striker is rather shallow. I think it would make sense to bring him back 




 sorry about that, I just shared it from the site I saw it on. And really, watching the video is the only thing one really needs to see. but I'll try to do better next time 























































































































 yeah, sorry about that, in the course of cutting   pasting and then adding more some of my sentences got a bit convoluted. Will do better in the future, thanks for reading 














 why do you discount Colorado Springs? 


































 then I'll invite you to not cook it or eat it. thanks for your thoughts

 




 I've made it with kale (minus the chicken) and it was very good. great texture 




 yes, I typically have a few cans of chunk chicken breast (chicken of the sea, swanson, or generic)   this is what I used 
























 you surely could. I didn't because I wanted to make it faster   I detest handling raw chicken 




 right, I only cooked my broccoli and garlic for about a minute or so--just long enough for it to turn a brighter green than the drab green of raw veg 


































 the idea of having 2 static second divisions is fucking stupid 



















 how neat would it be to have both groups in MLS? a genuine city rivalry 




 right? so damn close 









 Ronaldinho 





























 given that Picault was the one consistent   meaningful player on the Strikers this season, I'm surprised 





































































 I find that first draft is just the version with all the mistakes   tangents   ugly notes--a way to puke it all on the page. So I like writing with a pen   paper because it allows for more fluidity. A type-script it usually a second draft, where things are edited both as I type and from the 1st draft/notes 
























 thanks, for the input. [the paperback cover](https://www.createspace.com/5113670) is a bit different. I really dig the pic, which I think is by [William Azcona](https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/s960x960/820841_553538574670517_705785478_o.jpg). I hope you consider picking up the book! 












































 So early in November I published my first epic fantasy novel, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/Adversaries-Together-Ascendant-Realms-Book-ebook/dp/B00PB4I5X4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 sr=1-1 qid=1416618174). It's swords   sorcery only without the sorcery. I've been able to complete about a third of the second book in the series, which I'm hoping to have available in the early Spring.

 it's not poking your nose. purpose of this network is to ask   socialize. to your question--so far my book's been available for 2 wks as an ebook. not a lot of sales but through KDP I get 70% royalties which is solid. So, will it pay your rent? No. Will it make more money than not publishing? Yes 














 I'm writing my second fantasy novel now, just self-published the first [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4). Would love to hear your thought, Hannah 
































































 Here's your resource: http://www.openculture.com/2014/11/download-110-free-philosophy-ebooks-from-aristotle-to-nietzsche-wittgenstein.htm 



















 Anthony Ryan's Blood Song was a big hit recently. And you could try [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)
Tumbledown, Robert Boswell
Girl in the Road, Monica Byrne
The Search, Geoff Dyer 




 Maybe looking into [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 














 I just finished Geoff Dyer's The Search--concise, quick read that's rather fun in that old school gumshoe kind of way 




 Maybe a fantasy adventure series, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 I'll suggest [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4), more of a fantasy adventure story but without magic just in a strange world 




 Give [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) a try, easy to approach, get into, set down, and come back to 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) has seven main characters, three of which are women--a rugged adventurer, a scrappy daughter of an elite, and a priestess who becomes more than what her faith can handle. All of them resist or grow beyond the damsel in distress trope 




 Why not give [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) a try 




 I submit [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 There are a slew of new ebook series to get into early on like [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 I really enjoyed Blood Song, easy to get into and satisfying. Also, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) doesn't have any sex or magic, but it's mostly characters talking and thinking so it's light on gore
 




 If you're interested in a quick read as an ebook that's a new series [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 so then what could such a genre be called? Speculative, maybe? 




 fair point, I'll polish that line. 









 I wrote what I consider to be a fantasy novel, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4), but I made it a point to not have any magic. It seems that a lot of folk in the genre are resistant to this idea. Regardless of the quality of my scribbling, I'm wondering what others think. Does a story that's fantasy have to have magic? If it doesn't, is it then sci-fi? If not, what kind of genre would it be? 




 Blood Song and The Name of the Wind are easily accessible and engaging. I would also say [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 I wrote [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) to feature three strong woman leads--one an aggressive adventurer, one a scrappy daughter of a city's leader, and another a nun-like character that sheds her naivete but refuses to compromise her beliefs. All done without having to fall in love or be damsels in distress 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) is about groups of elites in a fantasy world looking to conquer--one character is looking to take over the world's religion, another wants to become emperor, and a third wants to bring to the world to its knees by dominating it economically 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) is a fantasy adventure but it has zero magic and centers more around the plots and scheming of elites looking for more power and the common folk enduring them 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) keeps things platonic, simply people trying forge trusting relationships 




 Writing [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) I made it a point to work towards a balance of active, meaningful men and women characters that aren't 'in love' but are just people working together 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) centers around a core of seven characters involved in intrigues of four different nations vying for power 




 I'd like to think the character Avery Roth in [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) fits this 














 one of the things I always thought would be cool would be to base fantasy or scifi worlds on the what the continents looked like in deep time. this is part of a small attempt to do so 








































































































 there is no promotion, there's only buying in 




 they do seem behind the curve when compared to the other Florida teams 












































 Sorry. I knew there'd be jerks but I kinda assumed there'd be more folk to read it   be smart about it. 





























 there are plenty of good writers covering individual teams, a print subscription magazine coupled with a free alt digital version would really be a boost to the fans.

It would just have to avoid being a trite mouthpiece like nearly all MLS sanctioned coverage

And [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) begins a new fantasy series

 good signings, Okafor could have a breakout year

 I would be willing to bet that Castrillon has a green card 




 I'm really liking the flavor of this Jax team 









 I wouldn't panic. Carolina, SA,   Ft.L all have fewer players on their rosters than Jacksonville. Just means contracts aren't official yet, plenty of signings to come for all teams 









 the vast majority of NPSL players are college players so they can't get paid due to NCAA rules. nearly every NPSL team has a couple of semi-pro guys, older players or foreign players that are looking to keep sharp   move up. the costs for a NPSL club are mostly grounds, staff,   kits 




 this is a good pick up, he's the kind of forward that could really excel in NASL 














 superb signing. the attack looks really strong, but I still worry about the defense 














 I also found Goodreads to be a great help 




 I prefer rather subdued covers, but I understand where you're coming from. Check out my blog for more info on the book, and I'd definitely be will to do a review swap. Drop me a line 


































 he did. I was really surprised to see that but I suppose Ambersley   Taka will be good veteran influences on the rookies that'll make up most of the team. do we know what team St. Louis is affiliating with in MLS? 





























 agreed. I'm seeing Ibarra following a path similar to Luke Mulholland's 




 solid addition to the defense   on the side that the team was the weakest. as a former captain, he should be a good influence on the pitch 














 actually, it's about ethics in gaming journalism 






















































 great project idea! looking forward to getting it. 


































 I don't mind unbalanced halves of the season, but it just feels like this number is well below the minimum. 




 hmm, still feels too short of a first half of the season. think I want to see a 12-14 game half 

















































 quibble 














 no worries. I was a literary editor for ages on my own book review magazine. Always read smart work from smart people littered with typos   glitches. Just have to comb through it with stranger's eyes.

it's difficult to express just how embarrassed I was/am that I sent him such a lousy copy. and now it's stuck with the book. I take refuge in the fact that he did rather like the story. I mean, 4 out of 5 stars is rather okay. 




 I get entirely what you're saying   Andy was more than fair to point out the glitches. The perils of writing entirely by-oneself is exactly this. You get blurry-eyed. But, again, with this book it pretty much went from November to building up the courage to self-publish to making it available for others to read.

Hopefully I'll be able to have edit readers for Book II. I always find that when I do draft folks into reading a manuscript they don't give the nuts   bolts kind of edits I asked for, they just hand it back with "looks good" or a series of 'edits' that are really their own rewrites of the entire story.

Thanks so much for the suggestions though, I truly appreciate the engagement! 




 I enjoy books that prompt me to look things up, so that's the kind of book I tried to write. I know it's not for everyone, but I enjoy it 




 Will do better in the future. A cleaner edition than the ARC given is what is available. Though the manuscript was a NaNoWriMo project   for a once through, I thought it rather good enough to share. And then there's this: http://www.wired.com/2014/08/wuwt-typos/
