 Other than the cutscenes stuttering the game is ace. 




 Yeah Queens Wrath was a joke, same content just re-skined pink. Same story missions re-purposed... The Queen requests kills, so go do this completely unrelated story mission. Makes no sense Bungie.

Haven't even tried Iron Banner, not even going to bother... The only thing that made me even remotely interested in the event was that gear and lvl actually matter... Seeing as thats not the case, I really dont care enough to try it. 




 I was watching your movements to see if they match on screen and it's surprisingly accurate. 

Going to try this out tonight. 




 The Hulk was French? 




 Except when you try to use the sprint so you can slide... and it doesnt work... you just walk forwards and crouch like a dumb arse.

Thats why this cooldown annoys me. 




 Tell me about it, the amount of times I've gone to sprint and slide in for a melee kill only to wind up walking forward and crouching...

 Obligatory:

[EVERYONE!](http://i.imgur.com/bot0NQ9.gif) 




 Id do it Sunday so it's ready for everyone going to work Monday. 

But that's because I'm a prick. 




 Looks to be the same size, full version should be an unlock.  




 Should now be working, if anything like Australia that is. 

Just started downloading here. 




 Why can't I pre load? I pre-ordered as soon as it became available on PSN specifically so I could pre load and play it a bit the night it comes out...

Guess I won't be doing that seeing as we're now down to 4 hours till release and still no pre load available.

I'm going to take a wild guess here... it's because im in Australia right?

*edit* 

Great, after complaining it now starts to download. 




 Op pls, I'll be waiting. 




 Reminds me of the short film [The Awareness](http://vimeo.com/82527075) 




 [The End?](http://i.imgur.com/JCpgIyT.jpg) 




 Reminds me of Tales From The Crypt: [Only skin deep.](http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNjgxNTM1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4MTU2MjE@._V1_SY317_CR104,0,214,317_AL_.jpg) (Se6Ep02) 




 The box around their level will be / flash yellow when they have a super ready.

This can save your life in PVP, remember this. 




 This. I cant believe other people havent noticed this.... Or the fact their LVL will glow / flash yellow when their super is ready. 




 [Nothing special](http://www.bungie.net/en/Legend/2/4611686018428942993/2305843009214944103#gear) 




 Yeah I got [Skull Of Dire Ahamkara](http://destiny.wiki.fextralife.com/Skull+of+Dire+Ahamkara) from him a week or so ago. 




 Get Vanguard / Crucible to Rank 2+ and spend your hard earned marks on the gear you and need.

Work for the gear you want and you will have it. 




 Spawns at regular intervals at set locations on the map sure, but which one of those locations is random? 

I'm happy to be wrong though.  




 Special ammo sould be like heavy, limited / random spawns and you lose it if you die.

It won't stop the abuse but it'll cut it down a bit.  




 I doubt the tradition let alone knowledge of Halloween would have survived hundreds of years after the collapse of human civilization...

But hey, I could be wrong. 




 All the time, same with the PS Store just loading a blue screen with O in the bottom corner. 




 1.5 Million non-biodegradable balloons released.

Because fuck nature for a short spectacle right? 




 Destiny, your character, the events in the game... It's all a Vex simulation...

The Grimoire cards for the Vex detail how the VEX are running simulations of reality to better understand and predict human behavior in order to preempt our actions. 

One of the cards calls them the Architects.

While playing the game and you die, if you look in the top right you can sometimes see your cause of death as "The Architects"

Meaning you are indeed inside the Vex simulation and your life was part of the simulation where you failed.

You come back to life because they reload the simulation /  it cuts to another simulation to see what the outcome could have been.

Seeing as the Vex operate out of space and time for all we know everything including your initial resurrection has not happened yet or may never happen... It's just a simulation of one possible outcome.

TL;DR, You're in the matrix.
 




 The Ghostless Guardians, they know whats really happening in the grand scheme of things. They're following you, waiting for the right time to bring you into the fold... to bring the Traveler down.

*dun dun dun*

Nah, I have no idea haha. 




 Because Sharknado had an estimated budge of: $1,000,000.

Meanwhile Dredd has the estimated budget of: $50,000,000.

So why not make a second Sharknado, or 50 for the same price as a "big budget" flick that people want to see? Even if it is only to say they've seen it or like it ironically... 














 Think about it, he looks the same, acts the same and he disappears then reappears like magic always with something new to sell...same as Merchant.

Also thanks to Las Plagas he's able to live for centuries, unfortunately for  Xur though Las Plagas has left him all Cthulhu faced.

Thoughts? Complaints? Agreements? 




 So as expected there's a few already a few up on ebay at the low low price between $400 to $500+

So if there's anyone out there that desperate for one... I say wait haha. 














 So I got around to watching [The dark backward](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101660/) last night and am now looking for similar movies that have a grimy, bleak feeling too it.

The only other movies I can think of that compare are 

[Bad Boy Bubby](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106341/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

and

[Gummo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119237/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)


They're intriguing in a weird sort of way, so pass me any other movies you may know in the same vein as above! 

















































 After re-watching the Pokemon series Se01-Ep09 I have come to the conclusion that all the Pokemon games are not real events and are Games/simulations created by the Pokmon Technical Institute in the Pokemon Universe itself.

In the episode: Se01-Ep09 - The School of Hard Knocks. The Students refer to Pokemons Lvls, experience, and when/how they will evolve based on this information, same as the game. As far as I remember they never mention Pokemon in this manner ever again except in the games themselves.

Then they show the Pokemon battle simulator, which is an almost exact replica of the actual Pokemon games battle system.

So my theory is that in the Pokemon universe the Pokemon Technical Institute created the games as a Pokemon trainer simulator based on their research and their battle simulator. They released it as a training simulator to help up and coming trainers learn about pokemon etc. 

This is also supported by the 4th wall comments in some of the games from the Dev team.
such as:

* "I'm the game designer!"

* "I wrote the story!"

* "I'm the graphic artist! I drew you!" or "I'm the graphic designer! I'm a skilled dot artist!"

* "Me? I'm the programmer!".

None of it is real, it's all a game within the Pokemon universe itself.

Or something...

*EDIT*: 

The games have some semblance to the real Pokemon world with the characters and locations etc.
It also makes sense to add Team Rocket and other real world events to show the dangers and characters you'd meet in each region. 
All the while telling a game story thats unrelated to the real world.

 Howdy all,  

Recently back in Melbourne after backpacking around Murica for a couple of months, I've scored a job doing outbound cold calling for funeral insurance and needless to say it bites the big one haha.

I have 6 of years experience with Telcos, customer service, tech support, provisioning and more. 

Sooooo anyone here work in any call centers that know of any positions available, possibly pass on my cv?

I've been on seek and Gumtree religiously the last couple of weeks and had no luck so I figured why not see if anyone here can help me get a foot in the door. 

Thanks in advance if anyone can help. 




 Howdy all, I was recently over in NZ and a friend gave me a PSN card as a going away gift... But seeing as my account is an AUS account I have no use for it..

So I pretty much have a free $30 NZ PSN credit voucher available to give away.

If you have a NZ account and want this credit all you have to do is simply guess the  digit/letter where the "*"is in the code and it's yours!

"*"MQD - D6N9 - GB4A

Best of luck and enjoy


UPDATE: Code has been redeemed buy u/adelope, congratulations! 




 My vita has been stuck on NAT3 since I got the thing and can't play anything online.

I've already tried every option regarding port forwarding for the specific games and PSN itself, I've also set a static ip for the vita. 

I was looking through the firewall settings on the Thomson tg782t router and noticed some options for dmz but everything I've tried doesn't seem to work and I lost all Internet connectivity on all devices... which was resolved once I deleted the settings. 

So is there anyone out there that has the same router and knows enough to set up dmz for a specific ip without breaking the entire network itself? 

Or should I just give up and buy an actual good router instead? 














 Howdy all, I've been playing on and off for a year or so, but never put in any real time or effort... I want to change that haha.

I'll be moving back to Melbourne within the next week odd and was wondering if anyone on here either plays the ol' blues harp and is willing to teach a beginner a few things. Or if anyone knows of any decent priced places that provide harmonica lessons? 

I did have a quick look online but I'm not sure where to start or who/where would be good. 

Any advice is appreciated. 

Cheers 




 Morning all! Just arrived in your fine city 30 odd minutes ago, have nothing planned for the day so thought I'd try to annoy fellow redditors.

If anyone isn't doing anything later today feel free to hit me up, we can go grab a beer or something. I'll be chilling around central park mostly.

Oh and this city is massive by the way, beyond my expectations haha. 




 We get it, Microsoft has changed their drm and online policies. 

Stop posting it as new news when it's been posted every damn 5 seconds for the last hour. 




 Hey all, what's there to do and see over here while visiting for a few weeks? 

I also saw a thread a while back for the global meet up but the was no follow up/confirmation on the location, any updates on that? 




 So who wants to help arrange the (first?) Palmy global meet -up? If no one, I can do it myself haha. 

It's as easy as confirming how many people are going to show then booking a venue!

So who's interested? Suggestions and ideas? 




 I know palmy is small an all, but surely there must be redditers out there to keep this sub active? 














 It arrived at my local store today so I caved in and bought it... I know I could have imported it bla bla bla 

All i'll say is, it better be good since all I've heard the last couple of months is constant praise and adoration from everyone and their dogs... 

Though I have a feeling I'm going to be severely underwhelmed.

Either way I will be back to give my impression of the game... positive or negative. 




 Afternoon all, 

Sorry for the slow update regarding this... but ya'll know how it is.
The event will be held at [Dash Paintball](http://www.dashpaintball.com.au/front1.html)

Right now Im looking to collect the names and numbers of all that will be attending so I can book in the preferred date and arrange the transport.

So if you are interested throw me a message with your name, number and preferred date for the event.
(I will be going through the old thread and messaging those who said they were interested for confirmation as well.)

I look forward to seeing how many are still interested, hopefully enough to make two teams for a days worth of paintballing awesomeness!

[In case you missed it, here is the original thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/13cj78/rperth_paintball_meet_up/) 




 Sooo... I hear the world is going to end this coming friday? Something about a Mayan calendar prediction?  *shrugs*
Either way, its a good excuse as any to have a pool party!

So in saying that, If no one has plans for the coming apocalypse why not spend it drinking MaiTais, listening to some music while relaxing in or beside a pool? There may even be a BBQ!

I live central east perth, most know that already but for those that do not, throw me a PM for more details / address etc.

Oh and limited drinks will be supplied but I recommended BYO just incase. 














 Anyone else notice this? She is completely irrational and unpredictable, her actions towards the Governor have little to no justification or motivation other than she gets a bad vibe from him... And I mean Rick has treated her worse than the Gov ever did... with her personality she wouldn't let that slide, but this fact will be completely ignored for the sake of the story progressing. 

Hell I wouldn't have her around my group incase someone accidentally gave her a wrong look, shed prob off them then disappear into the woods.

At least in the comic she had a damn good reason for doing what she did.
In the show... she's a paranoid mute clusterfuck with a sword...
So far tv Michonne has been a disappointment, other than being fan service for sword zombie kills she's near useless. 




 Sooo it's me again haha.


I was wondering if there are enough people interested in a Paintball meet up... hopefully there are enough people interested to make up two teams. (you can even make your own team names or logo!)
I think minimum team size should be 4 so we can have a few matches 4 vs 4 but would prefer teams of 6 -8


It will of course be held on a weekend, the date is open and likely not to be till after christmas / new years as most people will have their calendar full at this time of the year. 
I'm just getting in early to see what number of people I can expect before making bookings and everything.


If I can guarantee enough people I will arrange transport to and from the paintball grounds. (I'll rent out a Van or two for the day)


The only expense you will have to cover is the standard fees for the Paintballing itself, usually between $30 to $70+ depending on the amount of paintballs you require.


I was thinking of this location / company for the event:http://www.wasppaintball.com.au/

Unless anyone knows of any others they prefer?


And for the alcoholics among us, I will try to arrange post drinks back in the city somewhere (most likely at Moon   Sixpence) where we can get drunk and regale on the events of the day. 

I would really like to make this into a proper event, make a day out of it, the winning team will even get a Trophy!

Thoughts?
Good idea, bad idea? 




 Howdy all!

Hope everyone is taking advantage of this amazing weather and is getting out and about, not locking themselves indoors on Reddit like myself.

I'm bored and have nothing to do, so it's either loiter around the in city, head to a beach, stay at home or Go Carting!

Anyone interested in coming along? I guess 3-4 people would make it more interesting. 

The only place I know of is in Belmont:
http://www.kartworldbelmont.com.au/
(8 Cowcher Place Belmont WA 6104)

If interested let me know.

*EDIT*
For those interested we'll get this started in about an hour. 1:30pm
So anyone who wants to tag along simply show up at Kartworld around that time.

We of course wont be able to race straight away and will be waiting in the queue so there will be plenty of time for any late comers to slip in.

*Double Edit*
Those who are responsable adults can get there easily with cars, those like me using public transport it will take roughly 40 mins from the city centre and a bit of a walk... just an FYI
 




 Sooo I caved and decided to buy the retail version rather than digital and I tell you what, I am happy I did.. at least now I can return it...

First of all it doesnt require an online pass so this is a major plus for those who may want to share/trade the game with friends.

Now onto my first experience with the online side of the game... I'm yet to be able join a game past the loading screen.
In essence the exact same issues that plagued Resistance: Burning Skies online multiplayer are still present.

The game goes to join, shows matched players and then begins to load... aaaaand then booted back to the main menu, I have repeated this time and time again only to have the same thing, this is present regardless of the game type I choose.(I have rebooted the Vita, double checked my network/router setting and everything is perfect)

So either the servers are at capacity at the moment or the game really is a simple reskin of R:BS, multiplayer issues and all.

In saying that, I'm willing to wait a week incase a patch is released or it is simply the servers being overloaded.

Am I the only one experiencing this issue?


(Side note: My connection is more than adequate for playing online, especially for handheld gaming, I am also on NAT2 on my Vita yet I am unable to join a single game... those familiar with trying to join a game in Burning skies both pre and post patch will know what I mean.) 




 Yeah you, in the tank....

Just finished watching Se1Ep1: Days gone by again, so damn good.
Its amazing to see how the show has changed, in pace, characters and their development, hell even the walkers have changed from being hinted as retaining some of their former self (the walker girl at the start picking up her stuffed toy, the wife trying to open the door) to being shown as mindelss drones.

that's it, just stopping by to see if we can get some discussion going on for probably the best pilot episode for any show ive ever seen. XD 




 Ladies and gentlemen, (and gingers)

The night has arrived, we'll kick things off from 6ish onwards.
I've decided not to decorate the place, too much effort haha.

There will be drinks and snacks / food, but feel free to bring your own if you wish.
Also movies, bring any you wish to share, or a hard driveif you just want to show up to pillage other peoples haha.

Seeing as it is still a halloween / horror themed night, dressing up will be encouraged,  but I have a feeling many people will not. 




 So im watching it for the first time as I type this and my god, Christian Bale, the man commits to every role he takes on doesn't he.
He was near unrecognizable at first, how on earth did he lose so much weight, just skin and bones...

Oh and the movies good so far, not sure why I waited this long to watch it. 




 The night of Friday the 2nd of November has been decided upon as the night for the movie night.
The night will start from say... 6-7pm and go for as long as people are willing to stay.

Bring movies, bring food, bring drinks, or simply just bri g yourself.

To those still interested either post here or PM me and I will reply with the address etc.

Also, will people be making an effort to dress up?
No pressure, not expecting anyone to. 




 Ladies and Gentlemen, 

I present to you a proposition of sorts.

I have been over in Melbourne the last few weeks and will be back in mid next week, as such I would like to arrange a Reddit movie night!

On the 26th of October or the 2nd Of November I would like to host a Horror movie marathon in honour of the night that is all Hallows Eve.
(or the 31st if enough Halloween purists are out there)

- Location: East Perth, Central City at my place.
Enough for 6 people on couches, plus more on various seats.
- Dress code: Casual but dressing up is encouraged.
- Drinks: Will be supplied, beer that is, possibly a ghoulish punch of whatever I find to mix at the time. (Or you can hit one of the three bottle store nearby)

Movie selection will be strictly horror, or any film that induces fear... (Yes Deaditor that includes Spice Girls.)

This will only go ahead if I know for certain enough people will show up.
So I know how much effort or if any effort to put into making this  happen. (decorations etc)

So what say you?
If interested let me know and I'll pass on more details. 














 Deaditor and I are out and about at Fibber McGees in Leederville, if anyone out there is bored and feel like a few cold drinks on this fantastic afternoon.
The more the merrier as they say.

If you show up, we're out back, just look for the odd ones out from the footy fans. 














 So I'm on my way to work and theyre setting up some thing for qutting smoking, seems to be a good 10 - 15 race cars.
Does anyone else find it amusing that they would try to help people quit by using cars to pump out noxious fumes?

Its like *here, quit smoking and breath this in instead*

Thats all, if anyone is in the city during the day have a look. 




 Howdy again all,

Since my last attempt at a movie night failed miserably, thought I'd try again this weekend.

Aaaaaand it also turns out this Friday is Friday the 13th, if no one has any plans(curse you folks who know of the dress up parties) I propose a horror movie marathon!
Same details as before, location is central east perth, 2 couchs that should seat about 6, bottle store across the road, bring your own snacks (though pizza being delivered is a very likely possibility)

Basically looking to have a few people over, drink and watch bad movies till he early hours.
Bonus points for keeping the neighbours awake as well.

If interested send me a message, oh and if not enough people show interest I'll call it off and also stop asking haha.
(hoping for at least 3 to 4 people to make it entertaining) 




 Howdy all, 

I know this may be late notice but anyone up or a movie night tonight? 
I have no plans and don't feel like going anywhere... so I thought I'd try to drag you guys here XD

the movie night will be at my place over in east perth, central city so its easy to get to.

I have 2 couchs so could seat 6 or so people.(they fold out to beds if required)
Bottle store across the road for any alcoholics that need their medicine XD

I have quite a selection of movies ranging from classics to downright abominations....

If interested shoot me a message, I only ask that you bring snacks and any movies you might want to watch, oh and that your not a troublemaker of course.
(also, I heard there was a snes at notsosillynorwegians movie night? Well I don't have one, only a ps3... but if anyone wants bring one, by all means)

On that note, I look forward to hearing how many/if any are interested, can reschedule for next week if need be.


*Edit*
so this has be rescheduled for next weekend.
If still interested send me a message and ill get back to you with the address etc.
 



















 So a new cheat has been found for Unit 13,  while in a mission press:

up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, X, O.

It's a variation of the Konami code and it changes the screen filter i.e: lowers the resolution so it looks like doom, inverts the colours, makes it look like ink drawn on white paper etc.... basically keep putting it in to change the look of the game, there's a good 5 or 6 variations.

Also, anyone know how to get the dancing and other hidden trophy? 




 Sooo, has anyone else noticed there's pretty much nothing coming out until mid/late may?
Guess I'll have to replay my current games. 




 Hi Perth Redditers!

Im not sure if you can help, and im sure you get quite a few of these posts on here... but I am in dire straights at the moment and desperately looking for work. So I thought I'd try all avenues, cant hurt right?
I've already done the usual, seek, Gumtree, Hays etc to no avail...


So a bit about myself, im 26, from NZ although I have been in Melbourne for about 5 years or so.
All my previous work experience has been call centre based, fully trained, cert 3 in telecomunications,  cert in QA, training in conflict / dispute management. 
Each position was either Customer Service or Technical support / helpdesk roles.
I have a very professional phone manner, excellent time management skills and high attention to details, proficient in many systems.


Sooooo, if anyone knows of anything along those lines that may not be found in the usual channels to job seekers, as ya know, its often who you know, not what you know.

Or if anyone knows of any positions available doing absolutely anything ill take it...
washing Cars? ill take it.
laying bricks, ill take it.
handing out flyers, ill take it.


As long as its not illegal im willing to do it.

Again not expecting much, but its worth a try right?
Thanks for the time anyone out there may have put in just reading this... even bigger thanks and even a beer for anyone who can help out.

 Its your plans for the day using your preferred calendar.

If you have nothing on your calendar today then it will show no events. 

Create something for tomorrow at say 6pm and it will give you a notification / reminder close to that time. 

Or if you check your agenda manually with that option it will show up. 

TLDR; you have nothing planned in your calender today.

 Nothing... Nothing at all... that what gave her the time to come up with this. 




 Oh cool, yeah noticed the 4 horsemen show up after the first completion.

Wasnt aware there was more than that... The game doesn't really explain itself very well. 




 Yeah I got bored of it after a couple of hours.
Beat it a few times with different characters, tried out a bit of the items and combinations, did a few of the challenges... But it got old rather fast.

I'll go back to it every now and then I guess as it's still a fun time killer. 




 I liked the episode about steroids where Robbie eats these small spiky creatures to get buff and winds up covered in spikes and being super aggressive...

 Cook in bulk and freeze portions to take to work over three days, after that you should have enough to alternate between for the next week or two.  Saving you both time and money if you don't like to cook. 

If freezing doesn't work for you just make enough for the following day and keep in the fridge. Stirfrys, pastas etc are quick, cheap and offer plenty of variety. 

Or get up earlier than you usually would  to prepare a lunch. Sandwiches and the like. 

Not only will you save money and eat better, you'll also learn new skills in cooking which is always a good thing later in life. 

Limit yourself to buying lunch to once a week.

Don't like any of the above advice? Then continue with what you're doing. You'll either get another job making more money or you'll change your lifestyle.  




 This and limit yourself to one "big purchase" per month. No impulse buys.

 For some reason it annoys me when people use the word peruse, as most of the time it's not used correctly...

 Peruse: 
examine carefully or at length. / read (something), typically in a thorough or careful way

So you read everything in the "on this day" or did you actually mean you skimmed through till you found something of interest?

 Now that you mention it... 




 A movie about a squad of  3 or  4 soldiers during a mission. The story you  can make whatever you want really. 

The default film is made from spliced footage captured from their helmet cams during the mission making one coherent story.

You could even make it in a way so you can watch each characters / soldiers feed independently showing a seperate individual story per character.

Effectively you can make it 3 or 4 movies in one go without any extra work or filming.

Games like Uncharted, Wipeout, Gravity Rush. As well as the announcement of titles like Bioshock, Warriors Lair etc. And showing the tech demo of MGS4 touting how easy they could scale back games to port across... which was pure hype to garner sales and line their pockets. 

These are hardly anime/jprg titles that plague the handheld market... But they are what we now have because Sony fucken bailed shortly after release and did nothing to push western developers to continue working on the Vita and burning bridges with the ones that wanted to.

I play my PS4 when I'm at home and I can wait 5-10 minutes to go take a shit 
without the need to pick up a Vita to continue my gaming session on the throne.

Myself and allot of other people bought the Vita because it was sold to us as a "portable console". Ya know, to play games on the go, not at home.

But where are those portable console quality games now? Far and few between. 

Where are the shovelware / indie titles?  Fucken everywhere... Not too mention they have already been on every device. I dont want to spend $15 on a game I played 2 years ago on my toaster. I'd rather spend $40 for a portable Resident Evil, Infamous or a new damn IP... 

My Vita has been gathering dust for some time and thats even after risking purchases on the slew of Anime/JPRG schlock thats prevalent on the Vita just for something new to play.

But hey I guess I should be grateful that Sony allows me to play PS4 games remotely all the while passing them off as Vita exclusives right?

But was not the Grounded mode DLC. 




 Different DLC, that was the Left Behind DLC. Which was well worth it.

But was not the Grounded mode DLC. 




 Yeah it came part of a bundle, but not the Left Behind DLC. 

It was The Grounded Bundle and it was for multiplayer maps, perks and weapons, not single player related at all. 

They also sold it stand alone at $4.99 USD. (Seems like the price went up, it's now $7.55)

I mean cool, It's nice they sorta threw it in along with multiplayer DLC and gave other people the option if they want it or not... 

But again they are charging for a level of difficulty, something they could just patch in.  

Let the circle jerk continue I guess?

Edit: clarified a bit. 




 Didnt Naughty Dog do this with The last of us?

They released paid DLC on PS3 that was a harder difficulty...They charged you for a level of difficulty... The worst part is people still fucken bought it.

 Serious question, what the hell is up with the current trend of releasing "teasers" for a trailer of an upcoming movie? 

"Oh hey, you know that movie you know is coming out? Well here's a teaser trailer that the actual trailer will be out soon..."

What's next? They're going to do a press conference to announce an upcoming teaser of a teaser of the trailer for their movie... Why not just skip the bullshit and just release the trailer...?

It seems people care more about the hype and publicity surrounding movies / entertainment than the final product these days.

 It can play Vita games, PSX games, PSP games and remote play PS4 games. So it has a decent library.

It's not actually a bad little device,  it's just that the memory for it is way too expensive, the native Vita games library is very JRPG heavy with little else available. 

It's not something you'd buy without research... otherwise you'd be somewhat disappointed.

He also makes an arch nemesis: BUSH MEAT.

 Dont you give them to her in the hallway outside after the mission?

The one I gave her was when she was in the hospital ward. 




 Yeah I had already done that side quest.

This is after that, I was walking around taking to people and you hand her the one vial of Antizen and she says that it should be enough to get through the week. 




 Client side prediction, after the slow motion the game will speed up / slow down certain elements until everything is back in sync for all players.

Thats why there are sometimes jumps or skips afterwards, looks like lag but it isnt. 




 Heh, seems like I'm the only one that enjoys to dance around them...

Get in close and shank a few times then dash backwards or to the side, rinse and repeat.

late game it becomes harder as the range of their slam increases and a single dash will not evade it.

Still more fun than ranged combat, but to each their own.

 Theres a mission in Old Town where you have to get into an office building through the roof and it is controlled by Rais's men all with guns.

I didnt have any guns on me (had them in my stash) so I kept getting close, throwing fireworks onto the roof and running away.

Eventually a hoard of Volatiles came and bought their fury down upon the yellow wearing bastards. 




 You give that vial to the Doctor in the tower, well I did at least...

 




 Also has plenty of Dudes in distress as well.

 Just make it a collection of intersecting stories from all the characters he met / had a history with and having John wick as a background / cameo character that ties it all together. 

Basically make it Sin City in the John wick style/universe.

 A lot of the subtitles dont match the actual speech, it's pretty common / standard in games for them to simplify the subtitles in order to fit more information in the small time frame they have it being displayed.

But this one in particular would be a translation issue, since the Devs are Polish. 




 Well I'm sure the 7 year old you would appreciate being Bart Simpson?  




 Why?... [Because](http://i.imgur.com/3swLquz.jpg) 




 Yeah EU/AU usually have a delay in games, be it physical or digital, but when the pre-load timer is counting down for 27/01/2015 and that is what was advertised on PSN... You sort of expect what is advertised dont ya think?

No one has the actual reason for the PSN screw up, some people claim Techland uploaded the wrong version of the game (Some people got an Orange launch icon that did not work / linked to nothing, while others got a Black one  that worked) or supplied Sony with invalid / wrong licenses... Or Sony themselves just plain screwed up the release.

I'd go with the wrong licenses being issued to unlock the game as a few days after release I got a PSN notification from Sony saying to go into settings and restore licenses to fix the issue. 

That and when I check my media through the SEN website there are two version of Dying light there.

(There was a manual fix some user found out to fix it before Sony even took action. If you had the wrong version / license, (Orange Icon) you had to purchase / download a free theme, this would for some reason cause PSN to reissue you with the correct license (Black Icon) allowing you to push the download to your primary PS4)

And on topic of the quality of the game, yeah it's pretty good, repetitive but still fun.
Almost quit playing at the start though, 3 times I lost all my gear after sleeping in game and turning my PS4 off. 

Why?

Because the game has a glitch that resets gear and levels after sleeping but not progress... The only way around this is to do another activity to force another quick save. There is no way to manually save to avoid this issue either. 

It still has not been patched... The game and launch is hardly perfect as OP is claiming.

 The game had a terrible release outside of the US...

Physical release delayed for Europe / Australia and many more locations for an entire month, those who pre ordered the physical version and dont have money to waste to get the PSN digital release need to wait another month.

PSN Store screwed up for those who pre ordered / pre loaded, stopping people from being able to play the game 3 or more days after release... All with little to no acknowledgment from Sony or Techland.

Whether it was Sonys fault or Techlands it doesnt matter, it left a lot of people unhappy and unable to play the game they paid good money for.

For the ones that still need to wait another month will be bored of the game when it comes out after being inundated by all the information, pics, videos, playthroughs over the next month.  




 I've notice most American comedians yell the punchline if not their entire routine. 




 Yeah theres a particular species I read about where the female protects the eggs for about 53 months, starving herself the entire time till they finally hatch... Then the hatchlings proceed to eat her dead or alive.

 I played this a few times, we called it Wisest Wizard.

We also had the rule that after every 2 cans you either have a shot of something or a bong hit / toke from a joint.
 




 I get invaded 2 - 3 times a night, but can never join a game, everyone disconnects straight away.

Why dont people set their games to private if they dont want to get invaded... It's annoying to all involved setting it to public and quitting / getting kicked every single time. 




 I left and did another side mission, came back and killed the virals that had spawned and it triggered the next part. 




  You have 48 Hours.

A few missions later.

 You've been out for three days.

Uhhh... ok.jpg

 I'd say it's like I Am Legend, as they started off as mindless grunts killing and eating everyone.. But given enough time they evolved/changed to become the dominant life form and created their own social structure etc.

So yeah, you could be right. Some of the long time turned carry and use weapons, they also have ability to "change" back into Virals. 

That and when they "evolve" into other forms they seem to retain some form of self preservation and higher cognitive function. 




 Yeah I checked with the Quatermaster, all shops / survivor shops.

I've continued playing through most of Old Town without it, but yeah... It'd be nice to have back for online invasions.

Guess I'll have to wait til I finish the game and start a NG+ to get it back haha. 




 I completed the Rais mission where your gear gets taken and once I got my gear back I had everything sans my UV torch...

I've checked my bag at a safe house, quartermaster and all shops... No one sells them or anything. 

I've continued playing as its not really needed for single player,  volitiles are easy to avoid / escape from without it. But I'd like to continue playing online against invading Hunters... and no UV torch = no chance. 

Anyone know if there's a fix or a way to get a new one? 




 I first noticed this with the machete on the desk for the ultimate weapon challenge. 

It's a nice touch.  




 They're only still "there" when freshly turned. After a while they cease to be. 




 All missions show on the map, even passing comment missions show as an icon on the map.

Check it out when you play next. 




 Agreed, you already have the scavenger sense dealio that shows where they are... through walls... And is unlimited with no cool down... You don't need them on the map at all times. 




 Eh, I'm only surival lvl 7, agility 8 and power 6 odd.... And can survive the night easily.

Heck most of the nights I dont even get seen and the times I do I can outrun them easily.

Those who claim its hard or really scary must be as soft as raw cookiedough.

The game is fun but hardly the scariest thing ever.  




 !: Complete the prologue first

2: ???

3: Profit

Edit: Sorry man, not sure... I only got the Urban outfit DLC and that was unlocked after completing the prologue...
Heard there was something about "tickets" that you can redeem for weapons etc, try looking that up. 




 Complete the prologue first? 




 It's part of the planned DLC:

- The Bozak Horde: The final Season Pass drop will deliver a new map and gameplay, playable in either single-player or co-op. Go inside the Harran Stadium, the most famous landmark in the city, and test your combat know-how against relentless hordes of the Infected. Fight increasingly stronger and larger enemy waves as you oppose a mysterious psychopath called Bozak. 




 Damn son, did you only do the main story / no side quests?
Did you do no exploring and just ran from point A to point B?

I mean, it's cool if you did... but that sort of defeats the purpose of these sort of games. 




 Eh, the story/campaign is only part of the game and it does drag on... 

The survival mode is where the game shines the most, I stopped playing the story about halfway through and stuck with doing short stints in survival. Was a lot more fun. 




 Best use was in [Last Action Hero]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=60NVfBSdOG0)

 Sorry, I should have specified, this is applicable to those who pre-ordered or were able to purchase it before Sony took it off the store.

If you haven't purchased it yet... You're out of luck till they fix the issue. 




 They screwed up the licenses, some people are claiming they uploaded the wrong version on the game onto the PSN.

For those that pre-ordered some could download/pre-load it fine, others it would only download the DLC and others couldnt download anything at all and got a message "no content found, search the playstation store?"

There are two fixes available to get around this though, the first it set the PS4 as your primary then go to the PSN store website on your computer.

First remove Dying light from your pending download list then re-add it. It should then push it to your PS4 to download.

If this doesnt work it's because you've got the "wrong version". 
You can see which version you have based on the icon you have in your games list, if Orange... you have the wrong version/license. You need to have the Black hands one.

On your PS4 download / purchase something free, like a theme. After you have done this you will notice the icon for dying light will have changed from the orange one to the black one.

After that repeat step one from the PSN store website.

Basically someone somewhere screwed up and Sony refuse to acknowledge it.

 I dont have the skill for the idea, but Street Fighter.... Chuck could be Guile about to do a Flash Kick and the other guy could be E Honda doing his Hundred Hand Slap move...

Any taker? 




 I love how some people are so creative they have time, vision and ability to do stuff like this. 

And here I am on reddit all day while at work, only occasionally participating in psbattles... poorly. 




 Good luck?

Who needs luck? 




 Main issue for me is the controls, using the rear touchpad for reload / grenade was a poor choice... 

When its hectic they're unresponsive, you pretty much need to swipe the entire back pad instead of a quick flick. 

I find myself having to swipe quite a few times to even reload and also throwing grenades at my feet because of this.

They should patch in the ability to remap controls. 

Other than that is not too bad.  




 No comment. 




 I took this photo 3 years ago at a random art gallery when I visited Perth.

Not that I didnt try to find the artists details, I did credit the art gallery in various posts. 

The artist himself has since messaged me and I have amended my posts to credit them directly.

But thank you for your input. 




 Which means there was always a chicken nearby,  watching... waiting... 




 If anyone wants to try to find the decks or the artist, hit up Ihart productions.

Well played and awesome video.

Uhhh it's Dankey Kang thank you very much. 




 And rightly so.

It came out in 2010... 




 That's an aluminum stockpile, the owner is likely saving them to cash in later.

 comparable to early DVDs

Sums it up perfectly, though some Laserdisc titles  are superior to their DVD counterpart due to there being no compression artifacts / blocking caused by digital compression on early (even someof the later) DVDs. 




 I have a few players laying around I keep for parts and one I actually use.  









 Also the Tuatara in NZ. 




 I liked Moira, she served a purpose and was always upbeat. Felt bad the first time I nuked Megaton... 

Never understood the hate undue for her.  




 [Nice try Skynet](http://i.imgur.com/MPhCbpB.jpg) 




 [You're welcome?](http://i.imgur.com/xBQlolI.jpg) 




 And a fine caveat emptor to you too.

Edit: [Default restore](http://i.imgur.com/Z6LwZ7R.jpg), if someone else wants to try with the brightness / contrast. 




 Yeah 5 mins if that. Zoom in and you'll see how the colours are all outside the lines.

But if you're happy with it, thanks XD

 I've played enough Resident Evil to know that swapping those two stones around will reveal a key... Probably one with a shield etched on one side. 




 [They Live]( http://www.cultofvhs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/theylive21.jpg) is still [Relevant as ever.]( http://i.imgur.com/RsrSFr3h.jpg) 

Minus the Alien world domination plot of course... 




 Translation :

We've made our many back from the full game and believe that any consumers that were going to try the PS+ version have since gone to purchase the game. 

Those who haven't purchased it yet... will. Because fuck you, we're Sony.

 Move the cat to the position you would like, then erase the part of the cat that is overlapping. 

Changing the opacity / transparency of the cat will help you to see where the cat and person meets.

Hope this helps. 




 Really not sure where I was going with [this one](http://i.imgur.com/zoA3Hnt.jpg)...

 I was thinking more Monster Hunter-esque: [Felyne](http://i.imgur.com/I0HBkHd.jpg) 




 One black layer normal, opacity set at 56.

Another black layer set as an overlay with opacity at 44.

I'm using PIXLR though as I'm at work and dont have access to PS.

 Fuck yeah, I'd imagine the movie being like Taken, only on the high seas... 

Imagine a dark, gritty Popeye while he hunts down Bluto who has abducted Olive Oil... While killing countless sailors/pirates along the way. 




 I don't even know what wave dashing is...

 THANKS OP!

Eh, I'm in Australia, we use the proper date format like you so no stress there. 




 GIVE US THE FILES OP AND NOBODY GETS HURT 




 In Australia as well. 




 I went into settings then system software update, it downloaded and installed.

Edit:

Turns out the update has locked me out of all digital content. Everything has the padlock symbol  and has the error "cannot use the content. Cannot connect to the server to validate the license."
CE-33950-0

Cant browse the internet on the ps4 either, another error: "Cannot connect to the Internet" CE-33991-5

Cant access the store... another error: "An error occurred" SU-30709-9

Either psn is down or the update is fucked

Edit 2: After an hour everything's resolved itself, psn is back up and full access to everything restored. 




 All aboard the Douche-Canoe! 




 Those Nuns, always playing with [yellow snow](http://i.imgur.com/BK3u7nl.jpg) 




 It's all about progress not perfection, you're getting close to the later though, keep it up. 




 Snap, guess I was way off. Thanks. 




 It has plenty of good console quality games, along with PS2 and PS3 ports. 

Granted Sony has all but dropped support for the western market and relegated it to an indie and remote play device... On the Eastern side though, there are more JPRGs and the like than you can shake a stick at if that's your shtick.

But again, point being it has console quality games on it.
 




 PS Vita? 




 Yeah you can wait in game and screw around in the tower till it's fully downloaded. Or you can go play something else etc.

If you go back to the home menu and press the option button on the Dying Light menu item then go to information / details you will see the file size downloaded / remaining. 




 Pre install is like 5 or 6GB, the full game is 16GB

You need the full game to be downloaded before you can progress past the intro / elevator. 




 I havent played it myself, but Lords Of The Fallen seems to be what you are looking for? 




 Not sure how that would intimidate... I see that and think "Well theres a guy with extra weight and limited mobility, easy target"

Then again, I know nothing about war now let alone back then. 




 I've seen this [movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1031280/)... RIP OP's sister. 




 Good afterble constanoon. 




 Squaresoft... Those were the days. 




 Guess this was inspiration for [The Homer](http://i.imgur.com/nOI10tR.jpg) 




 So... Fallout New Vegas wasnt too far off with the Cazador... 




 It's the From Dusk Till Dawn of Sci-Fi movies... 

As in the drastic change of pace and themes in the third and fourth act.
