 No one can tell you whether or not you'll bond with your child.  You either want to, or you don't, it's that simple.  You're making it out to be some grand thing that no one has ever gone through before and is some great compromise you're making.  Stop it.  It's a new human being you're bringing to life and it's made from you. It's the greatest gift there is to give and is the only lasting contribution you'll probably ever make.  It's an investment in your own future.  If you don't want to end up a lonely old man you'll consider what things you'll want and will make you happy throughout your life.  For most people, it's the happiness that love and family bring.  If that isn't for you, let your wife find it elsewhere. 




 Regarding your title, I like going outside, it's pretty nice out there.  As far as your text goes, stop whining and do something about it if you care that much.  Complaining on the internet is not a solution.

 I'm not pontificating, I'm a grandparent who's cared for too many foster kids because of dads who didn't want to be dads.  I've far more real experience than you do, I'd bet. It's been my experience that it can go either of two ways; either he bonds with the newborn within a few days, or he does not.  If he does not, the child suffers and so does the mother since she's constantly having to make up for his lack of participation or, sometimes, abusive behaviour.  I'm sure there are some marriages that survive, but at what cost to the innocent child?  If you don't want to be called  daddy or won't step up for your own offspring, don't make someone else pay for it.

 Feelings of failure or inadequacy keep us looking back.  Why did they leave me?  Why wasn't I good enough?  What did I do wrong?  Could I have fixed it?  When in reality, it was probably nothing specific we did.  We're different people as we grow and change and aren't always suited to each other during certain phases of our lives.  There's probably something in a past relationship you miss and look to remind yourself of.  Just because we aren't with them doesn't mean the feelings disappeared.  It's ok to look back every now and then, just remember you're not who you used to be and have grown since then.

 I have two stories.  My sister once darted out into the road and was hit by a car.  I watched my dad woosh! over to it, pick that car up by himself and pull that child out.  She ended up with only a broken arm and he had a bit of trouble with his shoulder for a few days.  The other incident with her and my dad: she'd taken her aquarium into the bathtub to wash it(?) while he and I were outside throwing the ball around.  All of a sudden my mom let out a blood-curdling scream and, whoosh!, he was inside that bathroom, whipped off his belt and applied it as a tourniquet around her slashed up arm because she'd dropped it and it broke.

 We only get to be here a short time, but, we still get the opportunity to be here.  It's like a roller coaster ride, when our time is up someone else gets on the ride.  We only get to have the ones we love in our lives for an indeterminant amount of time.  Be glad we got them at all because it could have been a far different experience.  The cycle of life is as exactly as it should be. 




 I've heard people call those guys every name in the book and expect them to just volunteer to load up groceries, furniture, etc. immediately after questioning their intelligence and saying all kinds of mean things to them.

 I agree with your friend.  I don't need anyone to interpret what I should believe or not.  God has already told us how things are and I can pray anywhere, not just in a church.  I think people from every kind of church I've ever been to gave me some kind of insight, but so do relatives and coworkers and some posters on reddit.  We can gain knowledge or wisdom from anywhere if we're open to it. 




 Sure I can be a Christian, there were Christians while Jesus walked the Earth before the religion existed.  A Christian should be follower of Jesus.  I do not follow any of those specific requirements, beliefs or approaches because God didn't design them or say He condoned them.  He told us what to do and how to handle things in the Bible and that's all we need.  Not specific messages or anything that come from men. 




 God said all, I think He means all.  I don't think God hates anyone.  Jesus said He came for all men, that includes those who cursed Him.  While He was being sacrificed on the cross He even said, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do".  Can't be much clearer than that. 




 I don't think so because a Christian is simply a follower of Jesus.  They were called Christians while Jesus was still alive, before the actual religion began to take shape. 




 Religion, with it's attached requirements, celebrations, rituals, rules, certain attitudes or beliefs are all specific to the men who founded that particular religious interpretation.  They want to stand out in same way, usually as being the one true religion that has the truth and understanding of God's holy words on their side. .  That isn't what the Bible says, it says it's written for all men, not just the ones who believe like this religion or that one.  God says pray earnestly for understanding and you'll get it.  That book was written for everyone to understand, not just the "special" ones.   They all corrupt, in some way, what it clearly says. 




 Religions exist, all with their own specific requirements, beliefs. approaches and messages.  I don't support them. 




 I think mean things about people. 




 I am a Christian, I read the Bible and I believe in God, but I do not believe in religion.

 Swan, Drake, Crowe, Finch, Wrenn, Ferrett, Lyon, Fox and Byrd. 




 Apparently, they believe the poor or stupid cannot always afford an I.D.  I take issue with this because they need an I.D. to purchase, alcohol,  cigarettes, rent or buy a home, receive welfare, food stamps, social security, unemployment and medicaid, get a driver's license, go to school, buy a gun, get a job, get married, have a bank account, buy a car or a plane ticket.  They need an I.D. to rent a hotel room, get a hunting or fishing license, give blood or to even buy certain cough medicines.  Clearly the poor make good use of these programs and purchases.  No one ever raises the income or race issue on these things, but when it comes to voting they're all over it shouting discrimination.  This makes me think that that maybe the reason these liberals don't want to require an I.D. to vote could be because they could either be bringing in illegal voters, underage people and even the names of dead people.  Poor or not, they can and do get I.D.s for all these other needs and an I.D. for voting and proving legal citizenship is not an undue burden and should be required.

 A year after Amanda Berry disappeared in Cleveland, her mother appeared on "The Montel Williams Show" to speak to a psychic about what happened to her daughter.   Psychic Sylvia Browne, who has made a career of televised psychic readings, told Louwanna Miller on a 2004 episode of the show that her daughter was dead, causing Miller to break down in tears on the show's set.  "She's not alive, honey," Browne told Miller on the show.  Miller said that she believed "98 percent" in what Browne told her. Miller died a year later from heart failure. 

Amanda Berry is the women who escaped as a hostage from the home of  Ariel Castro and is very much alive. 




 Amanda Berry.  That psychic helped cause her mother's death and should be prevented legally from ever giving out this kind of bogus information.  That said, people are stupid for putting any stock in these people to begin with. 




 People who believe horoscopes are some kind of special, hidden knowledge and schedule their lives around them.  People who believe psychics are telling them the truth, especially when they conjure up dead loved ones.

 Judge Lind ruled that the 3 and 1/2 effective "years" Mr. Manning has already served since his 2010 arrest (a total inflated by time in solitary confinement) would count towards the 35-year sentence.  That leaves Mr. Manning with only 31 and 1/2 years left in the sentence.  If he does not win an appeal or get parole, he would be 56 years old when he gets out of federal prison.  However, in all likelihood he will get out long before then.  One possibility, albeit unlikely, is an appeal or a pardon.  Much more likely is the possibility of parole.  Mr. Manning's lawyer said that with military court parole rules, if Mr. Manning continues his good behavior as a prisoner, he could be eligible for parole in 6 and 1/2 years.  In that circumstance he could see freedom by the age of 32.  Being granted parole is by no means guaranteed, particularly in controversial high profile cases, but there's always hope and possibility.

He did expose war crimes to the public, along with leaking 300,000 classified documents.  He's a convicted felon, whether we agree with it or not.

 That depends on who you ask.  I'm not for or against the man, but I believe he's reneged on many promises and expectations he cultivated for himself to get support.  He seems to be more pro-govt. and corporations than he is pro-Americans.  He promised an open presidency and whistleblower protections, among other things, only to have gone back on these promises.

 They'll equate "separate but equal" as the stance to take to push a particular point of view. But, it isn't the same.  Anyone who lived through those times knows it isn't the same because in this instance, they'll have what they wanted legally, whereas during the civil rights movement and segregation they did not.  They do not equate since this regards nothing more than a label placed upon it.

 Lets see, we're pro-abortion, pro-gay rights, took God and morals out of schools, left drug addicted parents to raise future generations, use pedobear as a joke, legitimized unhealthy sexual practices, promote degraded sexual values (or not values at all) and consider them conquests, men leave their their babies to be raised by their mommas alone on govt. assistance because they don't want the burden, women mistreat or ignore their babies because they become nothing more than a paycheck, we've forced families to send both parents to work leaving the raising of the kids to strangers, determined the belief in God is now a mental illness and should be quashed at every opportunity, treat our parents and kids with strong depressive drugs, create unattainable personal images for young people so they grow up knowing they aren't good enough, passed all the money to corrupt people running all governments and many businesses, burdened all our people (and especially students) with taxes and fees leaving them near poverty levels, promoted the hive mind of get-in-line-and-don't-think-differently paradigm, spread our unique brand of evilness around the world and we wonder what happened while we weren't looking.  The blessing has been removed, my friend, it's gone for good.

Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, Democrats who both serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and have access to the nation's most sensitive secrets, released a statement contradicting this assertion. "Gen. Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the NSA's bulk phone records collection program helped thwart 'dozens' of terrorist attacks, but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods," the two senators said.

Indeed, a survey of court documents and media accounts of all the jihadist terrorist plots in the United States since 9/11 by the New America Foundation shows that traditional law enforcement methods have overwhelmingly played the most significant role in foiling terrorist attacks." 




 Mine would be 0.  She's a nice lady who works harder than I do.  I like her. 




 Being as active and mobile as I am now.  I will not be in 20 years. 




 I don't agree.  Fox is decidedly conservative while NBC is decidedly liberal.  Guests who appear on those channels or news sites are quickly shot down or bullied due to their opposing positions.  Each one caters to a particular mind set, as do the others.  They can say they're unbiased all they want but it doesn't make it true. 




 "I just really want an unbiased answer based on facts instead of opinions."  Yeah, don't we all. 




 Fox News and NBC aren't any different from any other major news site, they just happen to be of a particular point of view opposite to each other.  They're all large corporations going for the money, they all know what sells and they go after it.  There are no completely unbiased news sites and those are as valid as any other.  You have to read both sides to get an idea of the truth.

 No.  Anyone can type /user/username and see your comments. 




 There's no way to know this since war casualties are estimates, and the numbers saved couldn't possibly be ascertained or accurate. 




 It's bad because this isn't a free advertising website.  If you want to promote yourself you need to pay them for the space.  Otherwise, everybody and his brother would be doing it and reddit would eventually become nothing but an online business listing website.

 That if I pulled my dad's finger I'd grow big and tall.  I pulled that finger countless times. 




 What are you talking about? Black people use the word all the time.  It is not up to me or you to determine if that's offensive to God or if it isn't, or, if that is considered taking the Lord's name in vain since "God" isn't His name.  You should stop and let God do the judging.  You can't put your personal morality on other people.  Do what's right for you and let God take care of the rest.  Will saying the word "fuck" keep me out of heaven, too? 




 I find it offensive too, but it's their right to say any word they want to.  Make your preference known to the people doing it and then leave it alone.  They're adults with the right to free speech, just like you are.  Remember, you aren't their judge or jury.

 I think all their hard work and effort in anything else gets thrown out the door the instant they portray themselves as slutty women.  Got a PhD? No matter, show me that ass.

 Since when has the will of the people made any difference, or even been considered, in war plans and strategies? 




 Nope, not me, sorry.  I can't tell you that. 




 I'd buy a new chair I've been looking at for two weeks. 




 Assad is not a stupid man.  This is part of the plan and he's the sacrificial lamb.  Defense secretaries seem to have a penchant for war and declaring things with no proof but a few internet supplied videos. 




 Knowing that it would be my last life before going to Heaven.  At least I'd know I had made progress.

 Cauliflower and collards sauteed in foie gras sprinkled with stinky cheese and served over tongue. 




 Everyone should have and display good ethical behaviour, no matter what job they have or don't have.  Right and wrong conduct shouldn't be an option in society, but that's why we have laws.

 Yes, twice.  Scariest thing that's ever happened to me.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  Overwhelming sense of dread. 




 There used to be one called /r/hiddenrooms, but it's dead now, it seems.  I'd try /r/secretpassages for a start, although there isn't activity there either.  Perhaps you could message one of the mods from those subreddits for an updated place. 




 I'd explain the situation to the customer and why I can't take any action at this time, take down all pertinent information so that I could get on it first thing Monday morning. Then I'd follow through on my word on Monday. 




 I'm against killing any animal for reasons other than consumption.  If you're going to eat it then it's ok to use the skin. 




 You should have asked him to elaborate on that.  That's going to happen no matter a person's age.  I get that crap from 12 year olds.  Everybody's an expert when you disagree with them. 




 No one cares about your jeans or your shoes.  Stop posting this crap before you're reported. 




 Print out a note and tape it on the building where they're sure to see it.  Tell them they've been observed participating in illegal activities and if they're seen there again the police will be notified.  You aren't going to stop them no matter what you do, so you might was well warn them to move along. 




 The majority of Americans don't trust or support them any more than you do.  I wouldn't be surprised if they reach the point of saturation sooner than the government expects. 




 As long as they don't work together directly and one isn't the others' superior I don't see a problem with it. 




 I think you've figured out that American citizens are not the government.  Nowadays, they do things without securing proper approval or the citizens' support first.  The majority do not support any intervention in Syria and want more attention paid to domestic issues.

 I don't believe it's your business, either, despite your finger-shaking. 




 Because it's common courtesy to be respectful to others and some people are more vocal about that expectation.  Those people have lived through far more than you have and have more knowledge and wisdom in things you don't know about yet. 




 You want hope that things will change just like the rest of us.  I'm afraid that isn't going to happen no matter how much we want it to or spout off on websites.  Climate change is the least of your worries, or should be.  There are far greater evils at work right now over which we have no control. 




 How old are you?  Are you living at home with parents? 




 I think they want Assad out one way or another.  If a "threat" to get that ball rolling is required, then a "threat"  is what they will have. 




 Education, experience and sometimes Google.  Everything's a resource.

 Of course they can.  You don't have to be in every situation but you can certainly have an informed opinion on it.

 It'll stay with you for a while then go away while you're focused on other things.

 My friend attended the culinary arts program at the community college.  She remained almost debt-free through Pell grants and such.  The chef teaching the class hired her at a fine-dining restaurant he managed.  She learned so much about banquet cooking and how a kitchen actually operates.  She completed that program and is now in the baking program, since that's what she likes to do.  She did very well in school and is currently spending a month in France working with those chefs and bakers in different restaurants.  She's very good and has a great future ahead of her.  Opportunities seem to present themselves, even at the community college level. 




 It's a long list. 




 I was in my driveway about to head to work when I heard a news bulletin on the radio.  I ran back inside, turned on the tv to see it happening right before my eyes.  I just kept repeating "WTF", over and over for a while as the realization of what was actually happening sank in. 




 I'd get rid of all those nasty executive orders that I really don't like.  I'd pardon whistleblowers who did what they did for the good of the country, and I'd seek charges against all those responsible for the banking scandals.  After that, I'd seek charges against some people for war crimes committed outside the US. 




 I see them as actors playing a part.  They have to look and act decent when they're in front of a camera and say all the right things people want to hear.  They don't have to believe it, just say it.  It's a high paying job for those who can do as they're directed to do. 




 They can track you through GPS, have your home and cell phone numbers, records of all calls in and out, financial account info, pics of you, your family and friends, know if you have registered guns and what political persuasion you ascribe to and what car you drive.  Yes, I'd say they could blackmail anyone they wanted.

 Probably like it was too good to be true and they were coming for me at any time.  I'd be skeptical and wary at first, I'm sure. 




 Car problems.  I'm not a mechanic and don't know much about them, so when the smallest thing goes wrong I automatically imagine it will cost me thousands of dollars.   




 You should add tobacco and cotton farming in there too.  I worked a tobacco field once and never again.  Hardest thing I've ever done.  I do not recommend. 




 Weekends are very busy and usually aren't staffed by the regular personnel.  Some wait until Monday for perceived better care.   




 That isn't what this subreddit is for.  Did you even read the sidebar? 




 The effects on their economies was probably true.  Slaves helped build the economic foundations of the new nation. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 solidified the central importance of slavery to the South's economy.  That was an important factor to the rich, white landowners during the abolitionist movement. It provoked a great debate over slavery that tore the nation apart in the bloody American Civil War.  




 I grew up in Virginia and we had two years of Virginia history.  I think we got a realistic view on slavery and how it was practiced throughout the American colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries. 




 It isn't offensive or honorable to me.  It's like others such as Patriots, Steelers, Chiefs, Raiders, 49ers or the Browns. 




 Too many people get offended and want to sue for the silliest things.

Here's a [solved mystery.](http://i.imgur.com/BHl85iy.png) 




 Yes. 




 Air conditioners. 




 I have a male coworker named Shannon. 




 I'd feel far less stable being dependent on someone than I feel being responsible for myself.  Why do you need anyone else to feel stable?  Are you afflicted in some way, or are you able to take care of yourself and
 just lack the confidence? 




 I'll pass on the bugs. 




 They become fish food. 




 No, it doesn't matter.  Any woman could easily have sex multiple times every day. 




 It was more fun and less serious than today. 




 Nothing, actually. 




 60 is a senior citizen now?  It just keeps getting younger. 




 Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came.  You wanna be where you can see our troubles are all the same.  You wanna be where everybody knows your name. 




 My inevitable dependence on others. 




 Integrity. 




 No reason to take the kids out tonight, wait until tomorrow.  Keep it clean and cover it until then. 




 I'd go to the E.R. and get a tetanus shot and have them clean it out and cover it. 




 Caffeine.  I need my coffee fix every day. 




 It's so sad that our nation has come to this.  I would never have  imagined that US citizens would be so afraid of their own elected government.  But, here we are. 




 Why do you believe they'd all be so passive? 




 Russia and China have already committed warships to the region and committed to fighting any attacks on Syria. Iran is mobilizing its troops. Britain and France have committed warships to the region to support ours. Israelis have been given gas masks in fear of an Iranian retaliation.   Unlikely, you say, but I say most probable. 




 Of course it will.  Nations have already made preparations for it and forces have been moved into place. 




 Being a douche to the person trying to keep you from dying prematurely sounds like a great plan. 




 It's hormonal. 




 Unfortunately, you can be fired or laid off at any time.  They do not have to hold your job. The position needed to be filled and they filled it.  You were expendable from the moment you left work. 




 That depends on which side of the fence you sit on and which side you find most credible.  Both sides defend their points of view vehemently and show "evidence" to support themselves.  Videos tell a lot, as well as the news reports of that morning in the US and in other countries reporting on it. 




 I didn't ridicule anyone, so your comment is unwarranted.  Judging from the appearance of presidents before and after holding office, it's definitely a hard 4 year stint. 




 Askreddit is the third largest subreddit in terms on number of subscribers.  I'm sure the admins/mods feel they're needed here. 




 I've come to regret voting for every president I've ever voted for. 




 If you want good care and information you're willing to wait for it.  Most people like that kind of thing and spend time with their physician to get as much information as possible.  Sometimes it takes more than 15 minutes.  




 I don't think there's any such thing as a quiet mind.  Our brains are phenomenal, always on and not built for intentional complete shut-down mode. 




 Politics.   




 Well then, since you have such a good plan, I suggest you visit the local prison and ask some guy who's been convicted of drug trafficking to tell you the name of his supplier.  Surely he'll share that info with you. 




 If you don't know where to get them you probably shouldn't have them. 




 They are the offspring of fallen angels and human women.

 Both parties would demand a candidate from their own party, consequently, they'd never agree on anything and nothing would ever get done.  It would be worse than it is now, even more corrupt and far more costly. 




 You end it with her so she can be with someone her own age.  Deal with your midlife crisis in a more realistic way.  Give all your money and belongings to your nephew so he can burn them while you watch.  You burned him now it's his turn.

 It would have been either Tucker or Dale due to their inept, bungling attempt at helping me. 




 The possibility of a heart attack or debilitating stroke that makes the quality of life terrible, or worse, end up left to die in a nursing home. 




 It's a very wrong application of the knowledge involved.  I think it should be illegal. 




 What more do you want?  They've already confirmed suspicions; it's a base for testing top-secret aircraft and weaponry.  You want UFO's, but  what if it was nothing more than some type of spycraft from a different country trying to gather intel?  There won't be any alien presence disclosed because they do not exist. 




 They're tolerated because there is no other choice in the matter.

 I love asparagus baked crispy in the oven, wrapped in bacon and topped with cheese.  Everyone else is just, "eww, asparagus."
 




 I'm only familiar with its' religious application. 

"Today, it is commonly used in reference to any prophetic revelation or so-called End Time scenario, or to the end of the world in general.  

The Biblical prophets' revelations show God's justice as taking place in the future or as imminent now. The genre of revelation aims to show God's way of dealing with humankind and His ultimate purposes, and its writers often reveal the meaning of present events in connection with the ending of the present age." 




 There shouldn't be any more taxes period.  We're overtaxed already.  If they want to make improvements they should start offering vocational classes and teach people how to do those specialized jobs. 




 If he actually follows through on the threat of engagement while everyone's telling him not to, probably so.  If he takes the negative responses he's getting and acts like a president, then no, probably not.
