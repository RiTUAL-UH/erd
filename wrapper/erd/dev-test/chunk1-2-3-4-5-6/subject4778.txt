 hahaha loving this, and the "should we give other people some?" and then not doing it, i mean come on man, those guys probably know a bit of English  




 yep you could say he is, its a show that likes stirring up discussions. They are standing at a building where inside they are talking about the whole discussion, and the people outside are there to support the anti-zwarte piet cause. But maybe it helps to know that some people would freak out just by seeing the pink mic because of their reputation. The people that are anti-zwarte piet are already assuming that he is going to ask weird questions to get cheap laughs.  




 To see what it does to people. This happened at an anti-zwarte piet event.

 Well not really, there is a huge discussion going on in the Netherlands about this tradition. This video is made so we (people in the Netherlands) can see how people from a different country react to a tradition thats so normal to us Dutchies. I guess you can say that some people from the Netherlands will find it "intolerant" to say 'Zwarte Piet' is racism. But nevertheless its very refreshing to see the pure shocked and angry reactions to the blackface and the other portrayals of 'Zwarte Piet'. (Black Pete) 




 Well, i'm Dutch, and as you can see in the video, its fair to call us idiots... 




 Goosebumps  




 I'm always surprised at how smart that guy seems to be...  














 Dutch talkshow sidekick shows a sketch of a guy who threw his baby in a thrashcan...  









 Hey Daniel, thank you so much for doing this AMA. Been a HP fan for as long as i can remember and you've portrayed him perfectly as i had envisioned him reading the books. My question: I can understand that you and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson grew very close during the filming of all the movies, but what was your first impression of Rupert and Emma?  




 Lets hope so, Zeeland deserves an Eredivisie/Jupiler League club of their own :)  




 Well the same thing is happening in de Achterhoek, all the young people are leaving for the 'big city' but still there are a lot of Graafschap and Vitesse supporters. Its just weird that there has never developed at least a Jupiler League worthy club which people could root for.  




 Always found that weird, there must be SOME sponsors who could fund a club in Zeeland. It is interesting to see which clubs are supported over there instead.  




 Great work from Tubantia.nl/voetbalkaart 




 zijn alle 3 niet echt upcoming toch? Tuneboy is al een veteraan joh, haha. 




 haha stugge boeren uut de achterhoek, bedankt voor het antwoord :) 




 Hey Pieter, thank you for doing the AMA, i really enjoyed your set at Defqon, looking forward to the album!!

question number 1: i always admire that you have a lot of contact with the community/your fans, why is it so important for you to stay close to your fans?

2: what was the most epic gig you've played?

3: is there ever going to be a collab with Degos   Re-done? i've seen you guys together on stage, and i always thought it was a shame that you guys haven't been in the studio together (as far as i know)

again, thanks for doing this AMA, keep up the good work :D
 
























 holy shit that looks like a surfboard 




 holy shit, is this a thing... 

They've managed to make the bloody thing suck even more.. 




 God i love that movie, the prison scenes were almost as gruesome as they were awesome. Its one of those movies i have to watch at least twice a year. 




 i'm always the idiot who drives straight through the explosion... :( thats even more depressing because you weren't even #1... 




 Haha, well at least 50% is on something in that crowd, a friend of mine works in the camera crew of Q-dance, and his only job is to literally find people who look kinda sober enough to put in the aftermovie.

and ofcourse, you know... filming the hotties.  




 Don't forget B-front, don't know if you could classify that as raw, but god damn that guy can make some music.

and if you're talking about show, i will never forget standing in this crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IqSdC52Sks 




 God... 




 didn't know i was talking to someone who knows what he's talking about, and i agree with everything you say its just a bit to much, on the one hand its all house remixes, and on the raw hardstyle hand its only hardcore kicks with screeches! 

But as far as the shows go (and thats why i posted it), you can't disagree that its pretty epic.  




 yep, facebook has to know you were there i guess.  




 hehe, it takes some getting used to i guess. But hey, rammstein is also concidered garbage by some, and 600.000 people seem to enjoy it in the picture :D 

 




 God 




 This can't be a coincidence. Two weeks ago i remember waking up in the middle of the night. Still dreaming i'm looking at my phone thinking "well its 02:00, time to take a shower". I'm showering, grabbing my bag for work, i'm fully clothed, i'm almost ready to go make breakfast. While i'm grabbing my phone for a quick look. THATS when i realize its 2 in the fucking morning and i can sleep for at least 4,5 hours before my alarm goes off... It was one of the most confusing things when i slowly started realizing what happened. 




 and for the lazy: this was this years endshow of Defqon 1.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLYDG5k-LLY

Was really sick. 




 Look for Qlimax 2014, happened last weekend. Hardstyle maybe is a bit unknown in a very big part of the world. But its growing, and the shows they give in the stadiums are crazy. Lots of indoor fireworks.

 




 Didn't know there was a new season yet. Funny that they rap better than 90% of those idiots who are 'big' these days.  




 5 days late, but hey, thats good news! Is/was it painfull afterwards? 




 hahaha, one of those hidden gems in the comments. This is why i go straight to reddit after watching it at home.  




 Hope everything went well!  




 Only one hour left, nervous? 





























 Motherfucking Gary Oak 




 Ha, me neither! 




 wow, did'nt know that ! That really is a legitimate reason to make those parts CGI... pretty sad.  




 Dain, hands down, every dwarf should have a bitching pig to ride to battle 




 I'm must hoping we get a bitching extended version of 3,5 hours with all of this in it  




 I loved it! But not all CGI was equally great, the troll baby looking thing that Bard crashed in to with the wooden car thingy looked so so bad, but on the other hand, Azog and Bolg looked amazing.

And did they actually use the original Bolg in that scene where Gandalf was in that cage?

 All polar bears are left, and not in the political sense of way 




 "Now i have become death, the destroyer of worlds" - Robert Oppenheimer speech after witnessing the power of the first nuke testing... 




 thanks, i'm working at a local Dutch newspaper and i was shocked that we had more information about it than CNN at the moment :P thought it would be big news 




 why the hell isn't any newsmedia picking this up? I've been seeing tweets and video's of it for over an hour but can't find it on any of the big news sites.  




 Great guy!  




 Hoyte van Hoytema could be the name of the villain 




 wow, amazing! Walking Dead mid season finale had me close, but this actually made me cry a little.

Beautiful 




 Lets hope this time it won't stomp my hopes and dreams. 
 




 I guess you are so fun at parties... i really don't care how other people act on festivals, if i'm enjoying myself the way i want, then who cares what other people do. If they don't bother me. 




 haha gotta love the reaction Bouhlarouz gave, imitating LVG "this is different cook"

love stonecoal English  




 hey guys, he looks like Louis CK 
























 holy shit thats satisfying 




 He reminds me of Robin Williams... now i'm sad :( 




 Question of questions, would you rather fight ten Peter Dinklage sized horses, or one horse sized Peter Dinklage? 




 When he said "i really want to go home" and the way he talked to the guy, he sounds so scared. So glad nothing went wrong.  




 I have so much respect for the doorman, he acted perfectly.  




 Holy shit i was shaking when they showed it, this is crazy. Guy thinks he's james bond or something. Amazing that the NOS immediately broadcasts the video. Thanks for uploading!  




 Please don't give us Dutchies an excuse to mention that match against Spain, dear god that was a crazy night 3, nice goal though, haven't seen it done in FIFA yet. :D  




 Aah i know this zoo, its in Rotterdam. The glasses say "Bokito kijker" (Bokito Watcher). Bokito is the name of a gorilla that escaped back in 2007 i guess. Some lady visited the zoo almost 4 times a week and thought that she bonded with the gorilla. But what she didn't know was that she was making eye contact and seeking for attention, which the gorilla sees as agressive behaviour. 

When Bokito escaped he went straight for the lady, dragged her through the zoo and bit her hundreds of times. 

In this video you can see the lady interact with Bokito and some images of the escape (mind you, its all in Dutch).

 RIGHT, it really has that Interstallar look and feel for a big part of the trailer.  




 I would drink a beer with this guy. He seems fun.  




 You can't even see the damn planet with your own eyes if you don't know where to look. At least i can't. And we managed to get pictures from a goddamn robot we send there. Crazy stuff.  




 Was just about to say the same, i'm literally just looking at pictures of sand and rock, but just thinking about how amazing it is that we can see pictures like that... blows my mind! 




 Reddit at its finest... English is nog my first language... 




 well maybe its just the way you play? For some reason i play way better with Ozil CAM then Di Maria CAM, Di Maria is obviously the better player... 




 I'm more jealous of this squad then all the " look at my TOTY " posts... Looks so fun to play.
 




 If i was playing fifa 14... yeah 




 Holy shit, that is a sick squad...  




 I personally hated Falcao, i'm playing Costa Sturridge which is an amazing combination!! 




 This year they raise money for woman who are victims of sexual assault in warzones. They've already raised over a million euro's in the first day! 
























 Hmm salty bacon 




 My mom suffers from migraine, it started just having it once a month, then once a week, then more, and now she has it every two days. And when she has it, she's laying in bed for at least day.

Just two weeks ago she hit rock bottom and took a bunch of pills because she just couldnt take it anymore... she literally has no life. I'm super happy that she woke my dad up because she regretted doing it. They went to the hospital and pumped her stomach. I am still fuming with anger. It just feels so weird that she made that decision and i want to help her but i cant stop being mad at her. Event though i know i'm not helping her with it.  




 Harry motherfucking Potter, that shit was literally magical... still waiting for that letter from Hogwarts though.... 




 PSV, Depay = Dutch hope for the future 3 




 Love the black and blue hat... 




 I have no clue who "vision" is, but i'm psyched.  




 I want to mix it with a coke... 




 Have you seen Hollands Hoop? Its just a Breaking Bad ripoff with weed instead of meth...  




 This season is just amazing... its what i've hoped it to be when i started watching season 1.  




 Haha for me it still sounds silly, didn't know the band but it sounds like a parody to me. Its exactly what i meant, Dutch people who try to sound tough... just doesn't work.  




 Then who's the sorry bastard who gets chopped up in a million pieces like robot Frieza...  




 I have to stop cutting onions while watching this kind of stuff..  




 Its just a way of acting that we do in movies, it feels like they're acting like they are in a play instead of a movie... don't know how to describe it better, but everything is just so, exaggerated, the talking the hand gestures everything just feels so fake. I'm not talking about this movie though, haven't seen it :P
 




 Never had Froot Loops, but they look disgusting... 




 I don't know what it is, but Dutch movies are so cringeworthy, i'm Dutch myself but people who try to sound tough in Dutch sound so silly.   




 I'd exchange it for Russian rubles... 




 Its legal here (Living in the Netherlands) i just never understood the fun of it... Maybe thats why it works here, it just takes the edge off your teenage acts of rebellion. Booze works though. 




 *sigh* Clash of Clans  




 "HEART HEARt HEArt Heart heart hear hea he h...." 
























 Tanks alot... 




 Thanks for responding! When i used version 4 of both crack and update it worked... Haven't had any crashes, works really well! Your tutorial helped a lot, Thanks again :) Now that i know that it runs on my pc i'm going to buy it.  




 All 3 the cracked files are in the right map and i did everything you said but i still keep getting the "please run GTA5.exe" error... don't know what i did wrong... Maybe a dumb question but does it matter what versions i use? Does crack v2 give an error with update 3? And do i need all the other updates before i can use update 3? (hope you know what i mean) 




 For a second i thought these were huge fitness dumbbells, but then i thought.. nahh its Reddit.

 Its the details that did the trick for me, you could just feel the impact of the punches in my theater. This movie has the best sound design i ever heard/felt in a movietheater! 




 Exactly, the whole movie i thought he would die, especially because of all the emotional wife and kids stuff. I'm so glad i was wrong. 




 Its one of his most quoted lines from the movie by now... don't know the exact context anymore. Oh well, now i have an excuse to go see it again. 




 America wants to be in the centre of the earth so bad it rips Russia in half... Looks so weird to me (European) 




 For number 2 i was thinking Planet Hulk, him flying away like that, still transformed... 




 fair enough  




 Thats why these movies are great, you don't just want to see them F up badguys... (gotta watch the language) 




 I laughed so hard when Hawkeye was about to shoot Quicksilver whilst saying "I could do it... no one would know..." i did'nt like Hawkeye in the first movie, but they made him one of the most likeable characters in this movie.  




 I don't know what they do right, but you could feel the impact of those punches in the theater... Amazingly done.  




 Absolutely loved this movie! It was such an entertaining experience, but those Russian accents from Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were terrible.  




 Even the shittiest theater in the shittiest part of the shitty Netherlands has Age of Ultron, and i have seen the first screening of it... Take that America, Ne-Ther-Lands, Ne-Ther-Lands (i guess the chant works better when you shout U.S.A) 




 David Luiz... 25 million for each nutmeg. 




 i don't know why but this comment made me laugh out loud... 




 Pack of Velociraptors, jurassic world style...
