 No, unfortunately they only lasted a year. I remembered these in middle school and how I begged my mom to buy them though. Here's the link:

 DEception :( 




 Point Loma Seafoods down at Point Loma is very similar to El Pescador in terms of what they offer, except it's a much larger fish market. Might want to check them out for possible oysters. 




 Your dad is great, ever thought about asking him to do a IAMA through your account? 




 Fleming's happy hour burger is huge with slices of bacon and onion rings for $6. Best burger for your dollar IMO.  




 The rapture was the least of your worries 




 That sounds pretty eggciting 




 "UCSD police are investigating an attempted kidnapping that occurred on 5/20 800pm just west of Geisel library. Suspect light skinned male dark curly hair 58 medium build wearing jeans. Fled on foot. Be on alert."

Hide yo kids, hide yo wife, cuz they be rapin' errbody out there

In all seriousness though, stay safe out there UCSDers.

 And that kids is how I met your mother...just kidding [](/trolldad) 




 There needs to be a rageface for being absolutely flabbergasted in a good way. Best use of the evil face I've seen in its short existence. I couldn't help but give it an upvote. 




 What?? Blasphemy! Await further recalculations... 




 And here I thought magikarp was the most useless pokemon 




 That is not creepy at all 




 Wow, that just left me shellshocked 




 You probably don't remember, but I stopped by to your booth at 2009 Comic-con. You guys were a couple hours late and hungover as hell. What happened to you guys the night before?? Haha 




 I believe that's Sutro Park? I loved walking around here because I grew up across the street from Safeway down by the beach. If you ever get the chance, keep walking up and to the left, there will be a parking lot, which leads into the ruins of Sutro Baths as well as Land's End, giving you one of the most unique views of the GG Bridge. 














 Chuck Bartowski and Morgan Grimes (followed by Jeff and Lester) for Chuck fans 




 [](/wtf) 




 Zito is slightly more bearable right now because he is on the DL (I guess that in itself says something), but when he is playing, it's every fifth game. I cringe every time I see Tejada, which is nearly every game, and starting for that matter! I forgot about Benitez, he was pretty bad.  




 Who else would like to see up here? I definitely cannot stand Tejada this year. I know it is way too early to DFA him and experts would bash this move as a bad way of running a franchise. But at what point would you think 'hmm, this guy's season isn't going to turn around'? He is bad on offense, bad on defense (he seems worse at short than 3B), and is a constant letdown with runners in scoring position. At $6 million for this one year, I would say he ranks as one of the worst in franchise history. Off the top of my head, the only other horrible signing I remember would be Alfonzo. Thoughts? Discuss. 
























 It's the only humane thing to do 




 I did this once with the glasses that I was wearing 




 New zombie fortress? 




 I see what you did there 




 I remember playing Final Fantasy VII on PS but I could never finish the game because my parents were too cheap to buy me a memory card so I would have to start over or leave the game running every single time. True story. 




 You know you're old when...you use that old school cell phone lol 




 Ain't that some shit? 




 If there was ever a zombiepocalypse, I would want to be fortified inside a Costco. It has everything I will ever need. 




 WTF, I seriously got really itchy and scratched my leg compulsively

 This kinda happened to me once. A girl was flying home for the weekend. I asked if she was going to go out, hit up the clubs. She was flying home for her dad's funeral *sinks down* 




 Is it just me or does that kid look like an Asian cabbage patch doll?

 Yep, we had a cadaver. I don't think we named it. It was quite the experience though. It was very difficult to work with in the beginning, but you attenuate to the circumstances pretty quickly. 




 Not sure, thinking about emergency medicine or internal with a specialty later on. Keeping my options open. 




 A lot of material. Trying to drink water from a fire hydrant is a pretty good analogy. But, you can always find time to do the things you want to do.

 I was at Comic-con at the panel this summer. Is it true what they say about the ticks in the area when filming on location? 




 I later googled Delorean boat and came across this:

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/361244777/delorean-hovercraft

It's the first and only Delorean hovercraft I've ever seen (or at least just the frame) and it just so happens to be in my neighborhood! Can't wait to see the finished product. 









 shoot...it didn't even cross my mind to buy them and eat them, damnit!!! 









 Nailed it.

 What time was this taken at? 









 I saw the same thing happen, except it was an average guy running full speed on the treadmill. It was very early in the morning so the gym was relatively empty. He slipped, and the treadmill shot him straight back, his towel flying into his face. Dazed and confused, he looked around to see if anyone saw. I did, but he didn't realize so he tried to get back on, without realizing that the treadmill was still on full speed. He slipped again, fell on his knees and got shit backwards into the stationary bikes. Probably one of the funniest things I've seen at the gym.   




 I thought he was more like "come at me bro!" 




 Isn't this Stephen Lang? 









 It's ok, LaRoche did the same thing to us. Then we became the world fucking champions so I like the trend where this is headed. 




 omg...too soon? 




 Rule #4, remember to buy a boat and live near a gulf stream to dump the body.
