McGILLAN, JOHN M. "SHORTY" - Delirium Tremens - Died Aug 22, 1891 - Age 30 Years  

He Never Blamed the Booze! 

His liver needed scraping and his kidneys had the gout, He swallowed lots of bitters 'til at last he cleaned 'em out, His legs were swelled with dropsy 'til he had to cut his shoes, He blamed it to the doctors, but he never blamed the booze! 

Then he had the tremens, and he tackled rats and snakes, First he had the fever, then he had the shakes, At last he had a funeral and the mourners had the blues, And the epitaph they carved him ..."He Never Blamed the Booze!"

"An advisory alert has been issued for a remote  volcano in the western Aleutian Islands after dozens of earthquakes were reported in the area, an early sign of volcanic unrest. 

The change means that five volcanoes being monitored in Alaska are now simultaneously active, the most in recent memory, said Matt Haney, a research geophysicist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. "

Too many quakes from Indonesia to the southern Islands, Chile, Acapulco and volcano related swarms in the Aleutians.

 /r/StormComing is simply this: an Archive of Earth Changing Disasters and Events, manmade or natural.

It's not a place for HAARPtards, Climate Change Deniers, Flat-Earthers, or Eschatology/Rapturists to post theorems. And as we want to attract sane, logical redditors, we don't want to hear about how radiation is good for everyone.

This sub is best read using 'new' rather than 'hot' or 'top' as it is an archive of events.

We cover these types of global stories:

* Extreme Weather (including watches/warnings), torrential rains, record breaking wind events, temperatures, tornados, hurricanes, etc.

* Geologic: Landslides, earthquakes, sinkholes, etc.

* Floods and flood watches/warnings.

* Solar: Solar Storms that may have impact on Earth.

* Disease: Disease outbreaks of all kinds, including rabies threats.

* Food Recalls.

* Near Earth Objects: Upcoming close encounters with Meteors.

* Mass animal die-offs.

* Nuclear accidents and events.

* Oil and chemical spills/explosions/fires.

* Wildfires.

* Drought and impacts of drought, ie: agricultural impacts, etc.

If you want to add an Earth-changing or disaster story from the news or reliable source, please do. Since headline writers often fail, feel free to editorialize titles to fill in important details from the story- especially the location.

We have already heard from someone who saw a flash flood forecast here that saved them from swimming home from work. Other redditors have been alerted to Tornado Outbreaks and took safety precautions. So we feel we are fulfilling the purpose of the sub.

As /r/StormComing is an archive of events, there is nothing subjective about it. Downvoting anything here would be as stupid as downvoting an encyclopedia entry.

Feel free to x-post to other reddits, especially reddits that are geographically related to the area the event or warning concerns.

If you mod a related sub I'll be happy to share sidebar links. If you would like to co-mod this sub, send me a pm.

 Over the past year I have been noting rainfall records broken worldwide. People describing these events use the words: torrential, apocalyptic, unusual, extraordinary. I remember an elderly Japanese lady describing one such event (in Japan last year) in this way "The water was coming down so hard I could barely breathe, I felt like I was breathing water."

As stated, I started noting a drastic increase in these events last year- out of past 40 years of serious weather watching. 

[Here is the post I made on it 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/1jzh7q/unheard_of_rains_861388_2013_a_few_samples/).

----------------------

Note from Kolby:

The anomalous movement of the Jet Stream continues to reflect the findings of Jennifer Francis (Rutgers) and her associates. 

In a nutshell: that warming in the Arctic is creating deeper meandering loops in the Jet Stream (Rossby Theory) and that this is *slowing* the Jet Stream, leading to 'stuck' highs and cut off lows. In other words, weather systems that would quickly pass or not be as intense are now intense and longer lasting. For example: two weeks of intense rain instead of an hour or a day. These deeper loops are also pulling in weather systems from deeper south or farther north.

Great little explanatory video: http://youtu.be/_nzwJg4Ebzo

In this case, it is superheated air being pulled up into the UK from Spain by a deep 'loop' in the Jet Stream.

 I have a good friend I have been gaming with for some time. He is an Iraq War Vet who did 6 tours. He cannot work now and lives in a very tiny town. He very much relies on his friendships in Warcraft for companionship and to provide 'something to do every day' in his life. 

His old laptop completely quit a few days ago and he has a HP Pavilion DV6 2057 cl - that he has been trying to get the game downloaded to ever since. He says it just needs a hard drive, but I think it is too old. It keeps giving him an error that states the Javascript cannot be found and another message about the graphics card being out of date.

I desperately want to do something but am in an extremely tight spot, financially. I don't even have a tree this year. 

I am heartsick that he will be spending the holidays 'alone' more or less. I thought about requesting assistance from his online friends- but he is very proud and would be upset if I did so. He needs a hard drive for the HP or even a cheap laptop that is just good enough to run the game. 

Any assistance or advice would be highly appreciated.  Thank you very much in advance.

To clarify, I posted disturbing images of health officials leaving the Ebola patients apartment in Dallas- making comparisons to recent images. 

I posted to /r/Stormcoming, x-posted to /r/Dallas   /r/texas 

The Stormcoming was immediately upvoted . 

The Dallas and Texas posts were immediately- within minutes of posting- downvoted to oblivion.

This is not something you would expect from regular redditors who want to know what the hell is going on in their areas and would have no reason to want to hide anything. 

Now I see the one on /r/Stormcoming is getting hammered.

Wtf is going on here? 







































 A few days ago- right after the Dallas Ebola patient was diagnosed, [this image was in the news.](http://static2.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1961092.1412271234!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/ebola.jpg) It shows 'Dallas Health Officials leaving the Ebola patients apartment'. 

([from this news story](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/80-people-dallas-monitored-ebola-article-1.1960700))

They are in normal business wear. There is no 'clean' station in sight, no hazmat, no gloves, not even shoe booties. You can assume from here they got in their cars and went back to the office, maybe stopping for coffee or lunch along the way; who knows?

Now today we see [this story.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/dallas-ebola-case-spurs-concern-about-hospital-readiness/2014/10/03/4afa10b2-4b30-11e4-a046-120a8a855cca_story.html?tid=pm_national_pop)

I found it fascinating that 'before the gate of Lud' Jesus will kill Satan. This is in Islamic lore. The town is called Lydda now- but the Gate of Lud still stands. I am going to explore more about this today.

But it is sadly ironic that people would try to block others from learning of a really interesting connection. Especially when a clear trend in Kings stories that the characters with blinding, personal dogmas tend to be the true villains.

 Kristie Baugus Moon was dating Michael Pearcy when she disappeared 10/27/1999. [According to her mother, he was the last one to see her.](http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/m/moon_kristie.html) 

In 2001, Sherrif Ron Wyatt and his partner stopped Michael Pearcy.

["Wyatt and his partner stopped a car driven by Michael Pearcy who was wanted for questioning by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation."](http://www.bpnews.net/4392/bivocational-pastor-recovers-from-roadside-shooting)

Michael Pearcy shot Sherrif Ron Wyatt and Wyatts partner then shot Michael Pearcy to death.

[Michael Pearcy is the son of Mark Pearcy- both Mark and Jeff Pearcy are under arrest for being accessories and accessories after the fact in the Holly Bobo kidnapping and murder.](http://www.wsmv.com/story/26480995/remains-found-in-decatur-co-belonged-to-holly-bobo)

It is difficult to find anything on Kristie Moon. It doesn't look like there were serious searches or investigations held. It's as if no one even wanted to acknowledge her disappearance. This is the exact opposite from the Holly Bobo kidnapping where hundreds of people turned out to search and the police held numerous press conferences.

Here is where it gets strange. Sheriff Wyatt, in three different interviews over the years (all before the Bobo kidnapping), has given three different explanations as to why he pulled over Michael Pearcy. Once for 'bad tail light' and once because Pearcy had been "doing something illegal earlier in the day." The original article states that Wyatt pulled Michael Pearcy over because he was wanted for questioning by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Which I presumed was over the disappearance of Kristie Moon. 

Now from the Associated press - a statement by Sheriff Wyatt thats a jaw dropper:

["Rita Foley with The Associate Press said that Sheriff Wyatt never expected something like this to happen in the small tight-knit community. He was visibly shaken by the news of Holly's disappearance."](http://www.examiner.com/article/holly-bobo-big-city-crime-comes-to-small-tight-knit-community-safety-tips)

Excuse me? This sheriff was shot by Michael Pearcy, the suspect in the disappearance of Kristie Moon and son of one of the guys busted in the Bobo kidnapping. 

And Sheriff Wyatt acts all surprised, like nothing like this had ever happened in Parsons, Tennessee?

Why did Wyatt give several reasons why he pulled over Michael Pearcy in the first place? Was the TBI investigating Pearcy in Kristies disappearance? It's very hard to dig up any information on this. 

We can't ask Sheriff Wyatts partner- he was killed a few weeks later while investigating a car wreck.

I just know that something stinks to high heaven in Parsons, TN.

Pheonix = 'supposedly'.  




 What the fuck language is that?
 




 Being stopped for no reason is humiliating and destroys police-community relationship.

I remember being taught in school that we were fighting the Cold War because in 'those evil countries' the police could stop people on the street for no reason, spy on them, arrest them on the smallest pretense. We went to Vietnam supposedly to prevent the spread of that behavior around the world. My beloved Uncle died for this. Now to see it codified into law and todays law enforcement officers performing it is both enraging and deeply saddening. 

Stop- just stop. This is not fascist/soviet Russia.

3. What is the origin of unique, advanced technologies that are discovered on occasion (such as the [Antikythera Mechanism](http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr))?

4. What is the origin of similar ancient stories of massive wars that occurred on earth, many of which involved [air transit and nuclear type damage](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/23630-ancient-atomic-bombs/), such as the Indian Vedas. 

I have been considering this since the 1990's.  




 So I was watching [a video on youtube of police officers shooting a pregnant woman](https://youtu.be/UKJZanyNUhE) who had a knife. 
I am always interested in comments and saw this interchange between Russians, and translated it:

   **Once again, afraid so killed a man/woman shoot to kill, this nation can be defeated in less than a month**

 
*Roman Brovko 1 day ago*

   Executing = fright?

 
*Antonioni Bardzini 1 day ago*

   + Roman Brovko they could safely shoot in the legs but they always shot in the chest, let the will of man will kill.


So it is how I see this 'new generation' of police officers in the U.S.. They can't manage themselves and have a strong streak of cowardice- and so they use the gun. Interesting that others, including these Russians, now see American males as cowards.

**Attorney: North Charleston police officer felt threatened before fatal shooting**
-----------------------------------------------

Slager


A North Charleston police officer felt threatened last weekend when the driver he had stopped for a broken brake light tried to overpower him and take his Taser.

Thats why Patrolman 1st Class Michael Thomas Slager, a former Coast Guardsman, fatally shot the man, the officers attorney said Monday.

Investigators collect evidence after a North Charleston police officer fatally shot a man Saturday morning.

Slager thinks he properly followed all procedures and policies before resorting to deadly force, lawyer David Aylor said in a statement.

   This is a very tragic event for all of the families, Aylor said. I believe once the community hears all the facts of this shooting, theyll have a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding this investigation.

Mondays developments filled in some of the blanks in what was South Carolinas 11th police shooting of the year. Authorities publicly identified Slager, an officer with the city since December 2009, and gave his reason for the traffic stop that led to the fatal confrontation. Police documents also revealed that Slager announced within seconds why he had fired.

Shots fired, and the subject is down, he said into his radio, according to an incident report. He took my Taser.

Walter Lamer Scott, 50, of Meadowlawn Drive in West Ashley died soon after the encounter near Craig Street and Remount Road.

He has been arrested about 10 times in his lifetime, mostly for failure to appear for court hearings and to pay child support.

The only indicator of violence in his past came with his first arrest in 1987 on an assault and battery charge.

Slager, 33, served honorably in the military before joining the North Charleston Police Department more than five years ago, Aylor said.

*He has never been disciplined during his time on the force, the attorney added.*

Slager was on a boarding team when he served in the Coast Guard in Port Canaveral, Fla., his personnel file showed. The 91 pages of documents were released Monday after The Post and Courier filed a S.C. Freedom of Information Act request.

He passed courses on how to use the Taser X26 when he was hired in North Charleston and performed well on shooting tests with his .45-caliber Glock 21. Supervisors indicated in performance reviews that he met expectations as an officer and kept a tidy patrol car.

Of the two complaints in his file, one dealt with a residents allegation of unnecessary use of force.

Slager went to the mans Delaware Avenue home in September 2013 to investigate a burglary. When the resident opened the door for Slager, the burglary victim yelled that he wasnt the suspect, the documents stated.

The man also insisted that he wasnt the perpetrator, but he later told internal investigators that Slager threatened to use a Taser against him if he didnt come outside. When the man followed the order and stepped outside, he said Slager Tased (him) for no reason and ... slammed him and dragged him.

But another officer there said Slager had been forced to use the device during a struggle. The investigators exonerated Slager of wrongdoing.

Slager will keep working during a State Law Enforcement Division investigation into whether Saturdays shooting was justified, but Pryor said he would be on administrative duty.

While the police released Slagers file, one lawmaker said the episode again points out the need for body-mounted cameras whose footage can stave off community speculation.

The city is expected to get 115 of the devices through $275,000 in state funding for that and other anti-crime initiatives.

Rep. Wendell Gilliard, D-Charleston, said it cant come soon enough. Gilliard has authored legislation to require police agencies to outfit their officers with cameras. As an alternative, he also offered a bill calling for a study of such programs. But he expressed frustration because the measures had not advanced.

People will say Im using this (shooting) as a springboard, he said. But Ive said these types of incidents will continue, and when they do, its going to be unfortunate that we are not using modern-day technology to stop the speculation and rumors.

The authorities have not said whether anyone else saw Slagers struggle with Scott.

No one called Charleston Countys 911 Center after the gunfire, and Slagers communications with dispatchers will not be made public until SLED approves it, county spokeswoman Natalie Hauff said.

SLED spokesman Thom Berry said prosecutors also would have to review the recordings and be agreeable and amenable to their release.
Quickly escalated

North Charleston community leaders have mentioned the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in urging residents not to grow violent in light of Scotts death. But, like Missouri police said of Brown, Slager saw Scott as a threat when the officer decided to pull the trigger.

Around 9:30 a.m. Saturday, Slager noticed a Mercedes-Benz sedan with a brake light that was out and not working, the police spokesman said. He stopped his cruiser behind the sedan that had pulled into Advance Auto Parts at 1945 Remount Road.

What started out as a routine traffic stop quickly escalated after the driver fled, Slagers attorney said.

Scott ran down Craig Road, which parallels the stores parking lot and stretches southward toward the Singing Pines community. A passenger in his car stayed put.

Slager told other officers through his radio that he had gotten into a foot chase, according to the report. The police have not given details about the confrontation that followed behind the Mega Pawn shop at 5654 Rivers Ave.

But with other officers on the way to help, Slager announced on his radio that he had deployed his Taser, according to the report. But it didnt work.

The statement from Slagers attorney, though, did not say that Slager actually fired the device. Aylor said he could not offer further clarification until the officer talks with investigators.

When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser  as trained by the department  and then a struggle ensued, Aylor said. The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser.
Felt threatened

Seconds later, the report added, he radioed that the suspect wrested control of the device. Even with the Tasers prongs deployed, the device can still be used as a stun gun to temporarily incapacitate someone.

Slager felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon, his attorney added.

The report indicated that Slager fired multiple times, but it was not specific.

Backup officers did first aid and CPR on Scott until paramedics showed up. But Scott was pronounced dead.

Loved ones have said that Scott was a family man who recently got engaged. They insisted that he wasnt violent.

His most serious arrests came decades ago, according to his SLED rap sheet.

County police officers arrested him in 1987 on a charge of assault and battery, and he was convicted in 1991 of possession of a bludgeon.

Ten years passed before he was arrested twice in 2001 on contempt charges. He would face several similar charges occasionally during the next decade until his last arrest in 2012.

He also had convictions from 2008 for driving under suspension and having an open alcohol container in his car.

Anthony Scott met with the police near the scene soon after his brother was shot. The report did not specify, though, whether he had been the passenger in the Mercedes.

The police took his cellphone as evidence. The next day, he promised in a public statement to find out the truth about what happened.

 I will be posting warnings / reports through the day here as long as I can. 










































































 A large number of companies capture voice prints of anybody that calls them and have been doing so for a number of years. None of them disclose that they are capturing your voice print even though they allegedly are doing so as a form of two-factor authentication. Then they can associate that voice print with accounts, purchases, etc.


When combined with voice prints from other companies it becomes easier for something like the NSA to be able to identify an individual by voice print - they don't have to have their name - regardless of whose phone they may be using. Plus that allows them to associate that individual to the person whose phone they used. That would include identifying people speaking on conference room phones where many individuals can be speaking over the same line on the same call from the same phone.


If recording devices are built to produce voice recordings using the same telephone voice structure the intelligence agencies could then potentially identify all of the people speaking in a room for example without there being a phone at all if a listening device were there or nearby. 













































































































 I see more and more posters to this sub taking screenshots in dark, poorly lit places or worse, under colored lighting. No one can see the colors of the Op's x-mogs, rendering the post basically worthless.  

Leaves me wondering if the x-mogs in these dark, blurry, poorly lit screenshots look horrible or great. 

Now, get your toon to a nice, naturally lit area, (Dal, Elwynn, Jade Forest, Barrens, to name a few) zoom in so your toon is not 1/8th of an inch high in the pic and turn up your graphics. Click and post.

Thank you!!

Third text chat: Oh I meant 5'6". 

 




 The type is not the same and the flag bars are distressed on the target one. The colors are the same, but printing white on Black is very common.

Wow.. so this means [I could distress these circles a bit, switch up the font by a hairsbreadth](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v1/1604256868/Factory-directly-selling-Captain-America-superhero-tee-shirt-font-b-avengers-b-font-font-b-sign.jpg), print this shirt and sell it without license from Marvel Comics! It's just some generic circles and triangles.

 Creative directors (in my experience) are middle managers that know nothing about design.

Well just call me a unicorn. My experience is in the material arts in the 80's, graphic arts in the mid 90's, digital design experience leading to the founding 2 graphic arts and web design companies in NY. During this period I was a contracted as a writer and graphic arts developer for Jupiter Media (Graphics.com) and started designing advertising and developing marketing programs for the Palms in Vegas, among others. 

Then got an offer as Executive Creative Director with a company on the west coast. 

An Executive Creative Director that doesn't know design is like a doctor that doesn't know anatomy. 


 




 That *one* line in my post was in *response* to business-woman bashing. If you are smart enough to breathe and type at the same time you know that. If not, deal with it.  




 So are you saying that like;

"But usually they're retarded." ?

or 

"They type with their dicks." ? 




 And with resource shortages looming with climate change, keeping as many people poor as possible (less resource competition) while controlled and contained. This is my sneaking suspicion as to why they are militarizing local police forces. 




 The ones on high horses were the ones attacking this woman and casting unfounded and unreasonable accusations at her, when she was obviously wronged.

Coincidence? Did you even bother to go read the news articles or [look at the image](http://www.opposingviews.com/i/social/oregon-woman-finds-her-t-shirt-design-sold-target-without-her-permission)? It's exact. 

I isolated the design and did a google image compare: there are no designs out there exactly like this besides the one at Target. 

And 'it happens' is no excuse when fucking with someones livelihood. Kicking someone when they are already down, from the safety of your keyboard anonymity, is cowardly and horrendous.

It's' also clear to me that the design is copyrighted to her under the electronic copyright act.

Source: I am an Executive Creative Director. 




 Nope - she is very attractive: http://www.opposingviews.com/i/social/oregon-woman-finds-her-t-shirt-design-sold-target-without-her-permission

The only reason I even mentioned it was because of the neanderthalic "She needs to stfu and get back to the kitchen" sort of remarks. 




 No, assholes who kick people when they are down or on the basis of half-formed bullshit make reddit bad. I don't care if they are male, female or donkey.  




 "Absolutely not. In fact, I'd increase it if I could..because I could care less about this place or the people here. As long as I can keep paying for my 7 mansions in other places in the world, fuck California." 

Fixed it.  




 I was - 30 yrs ago. He stuck the bag in his pocket and sent me on my way. That moment killed my naivet about how the world really works. 




 Perfect OP name for this. 




 Why not? He can afford to live wherever he wants with the proceeds of fucking CA in the ass. And he certainly won't live someplace that is dried up. Same with all of these assholes who are profiting from wrecking the planet one area at a time.  




 http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/35pq9j/my_friend_who_sells_tshirts_through_etsy_found/ 




 Like the young woman yesterday who had her best selling t-shirt design obviously and without doubt being printed and sold by Target.

 Redditors viciously attacked her, attacked the design as 'ugly' and 'unoriginal' (as if their fine sense of aesthetics mattered), attacked everyone selling on Etsy, attacked Etsy itself, claimed repeatedly that she didn't have a leg to stand on (when attorneys in the news articles that said she *did* have a case). 

Worst of all the top poster, doing the usual shitty job of playing reddit detective, claimed that she ripped off the Tootsie Roll Indian (on another shirt). That design is actually over 80 yrs old and has been in public domain for years. Despite this being pointed out, hundreds of neck bearded assholes jumped on the bandwagon, calling her a thief and worse. They were so horrible that she literally pulled that shirt from her store. 

This lady is supporting her kids from her screen printing operation in her garage. And these fuckwads attacked her - viciously. 

For what? Being female? Starting her own business? For doing more with her life than whacking it in moms basement? It was inexcusable and inexplicable. You would have thought half the commenters worked for Target. I am wondering if it ended up having a negative impact on her livelihood. 

I am just about fucking done. 




 Maybe I should have put an 'Irony Warning' at the bottom of the post to clarify it for people such as yourself. 




 And if you aren't terrified already- here is everything they didn't (dare) teach you in school about this great country.

 They are doing what they can to make it illegal to be poor. At least to make their lives as much a living hell as possible.  




 And according to [Gary Webb](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-levin/gary-webb-was-right_b_6024530.html), and now accepted as fact, the CIA helped bring crack, heroin and cocaine into the US to sell to poor communities to finance the Iran Contra Affair. 

The results of this was [horrifying for south america and us](https://youtu.be/azYxPf_Ahp4). That song was written by Bruce after visiting SA during the wars being brought there from the US. Some surviving villagers told him of the villages people being locked into their church and it being set on fire- children and old people to burning alive. We brought utter hell down on those people - and it was Reagans boys who did it. 
 




 If God turns out to be a woman.. you are in deep trouble, boy. 




 Revelations was written by the Apostle John of a series of visions he had of the "end of days". 

There certainly weren't enough people on earth when it was written to have a huge environmental impact. That is why it fascinates me. Because now we do have enough people and are having a drastic impact. 

Strong's Concordance states the translation for 'earth' basically means: 4a) the earth as opposed to the heavens 

And the word 'destroy' (the earth): 

to rot thoroughly, to ruin (decay utterly, destroy, perish).

And the largest disaster NASA had was when they underestimated the effect of weather on an O-ring seal.

 I had no idea, until this moment, that my 'religion' had a name. 




 The average American woman miscarries at least 12 times over a normal lifetime. Most of the time they don't even know it has happened. 




 Or as I used to ask people who asked my opinion on legalization:

"Would you rather run into some Hells Angels high on pot or drunk on Jack Daniels?" 




 This pope has been different about the whole 'rich lifestyle' thing. He got rid of the papal throne - the gilded robes - drives his own old car and lives in a 2 room apartment instead of the luxurious papal residence. At that apartment, filled with priests and bishops, he eats at the cafeteria with everyone else. He also 'fired' a bishop in the states for spending a lot of money refinishing an upscale residence. 

Maybe you should read up on someone before just automatically blasting them. You might be surprised.

 Actually, it is related to one of Gods last acts toward man, according to Revelations:

 The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. 
 
 The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small-- 
 
 and for destroying those who destroyeth the earth."
 
 Rev. 11:18 




 The Tootsie Roll Indian is over 80 yrs old and in the Public Domain. Glad you aren't on my jury team. ffs. 




 I am not talking about the victims. I am talking about the News paper. I have 100% sympathy for the victims. 

I just think that the news organization was stupid for trying to turn this into some sort of spiritual event using this part of James 1 about two people who died horribly in a storm.  




 It's labeled 'Tootsie Roll Indian' and that Indian is in the public domain. It's over 80 years old ffs. 




 Actually no, she doesn't. She talks about purchasing good quality, high thread count t-shirts to use as a base for her designs on her website.  




 Whose work did she take credit for? 




 Maybe she should buy some sheep. loom the wool. make the shirt. grow some cotton etc etc.

Yes she hand screen prints the shirts. Exactly as advertised. 

ffs. You would think reddit absolutely hates everyone who even tries.  




 Who did she steal them from? Link to designs or designers? Anything? You are accusing someone in an open court of opinion here. Prove your accusation. 

And the Indian is over 80 years of age and is in the public domain- so that does not count.  




 It's only strong enough for her to support her children on out of her garage workshop. 

Not only do you not admire that- you are obviously an asshole on a circle jerk. Let's see some of your brilliant designs.  




 It's public domain. Once again Reddit hangs an already hurting person from the nearest tree. Nice.  




 She is. The Indian is a public domain image.  




 It's a public domain image. No harm no foul. Except for the knee jerks kicking her on reddit. Fucking classic though.  




 Someone thinks its cool looking - she is supporting her kids on the proceeds instead of being on welfare. 




 Your edit came a little too late - now hundreds of people are blowing this off because they think she 'stole' the indian design.  




 Context and intonation- which you weren't there for.  




  A lot of people also claim they've already seen that #MERICA design on other shirts from other businesses.

That reason?

oh ok.

Too bad that absolutely 0 claims of this were accompanied by links to images.
 




 yw 




 It isn't an American Flag with the word 'America' on it. 

It's a minimalist design of the bars with #MERICA in the space of the stars. And the design she made a year ago is copied exactly by Target- right down to the font type.

Here is a successful and similar lawsuit won by an original artist against American Eagle:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/29/aholsniffsglue-american-eagle-artist-lawsuit-copyright_n_5627862.html

 
 




 You can say the same for Marvel Comics Capt. America t-shirt designs with the American Flag. Does this mean she deserves to be ripped off and they don't? 

Oh- the American Flag has been used before - so we don't have to license your design. 

Or- I don't like the design- so it deserves to be ripped off and monetized by this multinational corporation.

Doesn't fly.  




 Show me where her exact design has been done and I will agree with you. So far I haven't seen it. A lot of companies use variations of the US flag- and all of their art is protected. Why shouldn't hers be? Because she isn't Marvel Comics or the NFL?  




 And neither does the 'artistry' of the design. Yet that argument is throughout this thread.  




 Then tell the licensees of Capt. America flag t-shirts that they no longer have to pay for that particular style. Captains, America, and Flags are everywhere- right?

 Her Etsy page and website has been linked in comments from this morning, they are also linked on the ABC News story- if you bothered to read it you would know this. Since you didn't bother to read it, how you could be so self-assured in attacking this person and her small business? 

Obviously I didn't ask for a selfie. 

I haven't seen any other shirt design like hers yet- outside of Target. 

18 years ago the use of the term 'merica' was unheard of as well as the use of a hashtag. 

So I am very doubtful of everything you posted previously. 

I am familiar with US design copyright law having known a person who did a design for fabric wall hanging sales- and found her design on an online poster sale site - a clear rip - just as what happened here.

 She did sue successfully. Hopefully this woman will be successful as well.  




 Obviously you didn't read the story or watch the ABC News video. 

http://abcnews.go.com/US/oregon-woman-accuses-target-graphic-shirt/story?id=30983944

Searched the hell out of Google. I can't find any other T's out there similar to her design except at Target. 




 Why don't I see a pic of your shirt that is 'exactly like this'? Hers has a hashtag on the front of the Merica- she has a whole line of these. [I didn't know Hashtags were popular 18 years ago.](http://www.sandilakeclothing.com/products/merica-adult?variant=1093863397)

 /u/14YearOldsAreHot has one link karma. 

I am seriously thinking that Target has done the same thing that other corporations have that have negatively hit the front page. Sent in a PR team to lead the conversation against the small business owner and manipulate the up/down votes.  




 There is copyright on the art. She could put this on a wall hanging and still be protected by US Law.

 Beyond the point that Target ripped off a small business design.

It depends - you want a shirt that lasts a few months or a few years?

If you read the article or watched the ABC news video you would see that her t-shirts are individually screen printed by hand using  high-end inks on t-shirts with a much higher thread count than Targets. In other words- her shirts will last much longer than Targets.  
 




 Wrong. She has been selling this design for over a year on Etsy - to help support her kids rather than going on welfare.  




 I bet they don't steal NFL logos. And why should the NFL have any more protection than any small business owner in America?

 Spent some time here researching on different image searches. She definitely didn't copy anyone elses design and has been selling that shirt for over a year. 

You work for Target, btw?

All these rather new subs attacking this woman is getting on my nerves.

 Then they aren't doing their basic homework as a corporation.  




 There are multiple sites out there that give the data what are best sellers on Etsy in different departments. Don't need to google it.  




 So reddit converges on this magazine- viciously attacking it on their twitter feed and Facebook feed over lack of attribution to the band- and it's a pr stunt by the band.

And then this same 'reddit community', a few days later, viciously attacks a woman whose art was actually ripped off and monetized by a major corporation?

I smell a big fat PR team rat.  




 We have a woman successfully supporting her children by creating designs (whether it's to your taste or not doesn't matter) and screen printing them, individually, by hand, in her garage. Then selling them on an online outlet. 

We have a multi-billion dollar, multinational corporation finding the design, probably using [one of the sites that lists the top selling items on Etsy](http://www.handmadeology.com/top-100-handmade-etsy-sellers-2014-by-number-of-sales/), copying it and profiting by selling it nationwide. 

What is your 'Case in point' that makes the small business owner wrong and subject to ridiculous attacks while reddit absolves the multinational corporation? I really want to see it. 

Obviously she is protected by law against this sort of thing. Or did Target send some PR teams in to lead this circle jerk attacking her, attacking Etsy and even attacking Etsy sellers? It won't be the first time a major corporation has manipulated reddit. 

Electronic copyright law says she is protected.

What the fuck? We had a band complaining last week about a web magazine that posted their music video without attribution and Reddit was up in arms about it.

Now we have a multinational corporate box store stealing this persons design and selling it nationwide, at a profit, and the 'top' posters on the Reddit story are excoriating and attacking:

a. The person who made the design, 

b. the design itself (as if personal sense of taste mattered to the story), 

c. her online sales outlet (as if that mattered),

d. and all of the other small business people who sell on this sales outlet.

What the heck ?

Are redditors now commonly, en-mass, protecting multinational corporations over the average, hard working person in American who is trying to develop their own business? 

Or are there a bunch of pro Corporate, anti-small business PR people sent to reddit to lead the conversation and up-down votes on stories that make the front page?

This rabid reaction makes absolutely no sense otherwise. 




 Oh jesus I thought it said 'Making a mini sword out of a snail."

 Testing of Your Faith

2 Count it all joy, my brothers,[b] when you meet trials of various kinds, 3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.

5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. 6 *But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.*

9 Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, 10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass[c] he will pass away. 11 *For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.*

12 Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him. 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, I am being tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. 14 *But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. 15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.*

https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1 version=ESV

16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.[d] 18 Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. 
























 I live in a rather bohemian city (very small) in the mountains. This was a new, small business- so I decided to go there in support. We do crazy liberal stuff like that. 

So the guy is talking about how he had a shop in L.A. but decided to move here because it was 'cooler' (literally- we are in the mountains). Then he started talking about local politics in a kind of denigrating manner (while enjoying a glass of the cleanest tap water in the US and breathing some of the cleanest air).

I just maintained a neutral face, to see how far he would go. He apparently took that for acquiescence and said something about how we needed to get rid of all those 'hippies' to "change the liberal politics 'round here". 

Despite the fact that those 'hippies' are the ones bringing in entertainment, creating businesses, painting cool murals, holding art events, fairs and farmers markets, promoting local growth and keeping out the big box stores- everything that brings people here in droves to drop a lot of money into the local economy.

And so I knew where he was going from there - and I was done.

 They used to call themselves 'Tea Baggers' until they found out what it meant.

 I had no idea Kansas had a liberal oasis. Kind of like Austin in Texas? I guess I wouldn't mind living in Kansas. 




 We still have the guild. It's one of the oldest ones in the game. Pretty retired though. A few old players pop in to say hey every once in a while. I am not going to close shop though till the game ends because we have a few members who passed away (accidents/cancer, etc) and I promised their families. 




 Could it be a foreigner with a new drivers license?
 




 This is exactly what we were asking for.  




 Hey. I have chicken thawing right now to make chicken and dumplings.  




 I was there. This vid gave me chills. He also showed up at Ironforge and that was a helluva fight at the gates.

Also remember flying on a taxi bird to Winterspring and saw below this giant flame dog farting and belching smoke and flame. I rode back to where I had seen it and all of a sudden there was this boss, Kruul, walking toward town. Called on guilds and we took him on, about 20 of us. Wiped us completely out. So we called on some more people and ended up in a 40man competition raid with the Horde to see who got him first. 

We wiped-
They wiped

Then we brought him down. 

edit- found a vid some group made https://youtu.be/knwZl7my-NY

25 years ago my Uncle Duane became our family genealogist. He had money from a pharmacology business and traveled to places in Europe and the Mormon library in Utah. He traced us back to Olaf the Tree Hewer. My mother and I were fascinated with this as we continually produce tall children with bright blue eyes. All of the men in my family line are well over 6ft. We also have this tendency toward rebellion. Sample of this at the bottom of the tree, below. Some of these links are spoilers as they contain the lore.

Present day sample: My great great Uncle [Harry 'Slim' Sallee](http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/f5ef8e5d). Pitcher for Reds, Cardinals and finally for the Giants during the 1917 World Series 'Black Sox' Scandal. [His picture.](http://i.imgur.com/nACpt.jpg)

Slim barely spent a calm, normal day of his life. Constantly in trouble from the day he was born:

When the routine of practice got too strenuous, Sallee would leave St. Louis' League Park and walk across the street to a social club known as the "Grass Eaters", housed only 100 feet away from the clubhouse. Sallee often "exercised his rights as a member" of this social club. One clubhouse boy said that during games Sallee would lower a bucket over the fence on a rope to a confederate who would fill it (with beer) at the social club.

The players were not allowed to drink, by contract. But Harry would tell stories of being hung out of hotel rooms by the other players, run to a bar and get liquor and come back to the hotel and climb up bedsheets to the room. 

 




 Not with over 40% of Americans now living on Minimum wage. I am sure they are eating anything they can afford; mostly high fat, high sugar crap.

Where are you from, Mars? 




 Chicken. 




 Sorry, it's proven that people in the US are getting fatter and fatter from eating poorer foods and trying to make up for vitamin/mineral deficiencies by eating more. Also the food choices for the poor are overloaded with fats and sugars to make cheap bulk.  




 Just wait.. they are going from fat shaming to poor shaming. Just as bad and as likely they will end up there the way things are going.

I don't know what has happened to reddit lately either- but the most shameful thing is the attitudes.

One note- Poverty is the living, breathing proof of failure of the political and corporate system in a country. To set people up to blame the poor is absolving the politicians and corporate heads of their failure. Don't do it. 




 I knew a woman from West Virginia who moved to a northern city. She married at 13 and had her first child in WV. She didn't know what birth control was or how to prevent pregnancies- knew nothing about it whatsoever- until her first visit to a northern city doctor with her third pregnancy a little over 3 years after the first birth.

This was in the early 1960's. 




 Uh huh. 




 Then they should lie to assholes like this about incipient testicular cancer to prevent them from breeding. 




 Here is another one. [This was hysterically funny.](http://i.imgur.com/eA2QeC0.jpg)

When they first made snowballs in the game the targeted toon would flip over onto it's back. Everyone loved them. 

Also, as I discovered when my friends and I went to have a snowball fight on the SW/IF Tram, snowballs travelled at exactly the same speed as the tram. So the result was that once everyone got off the tram they would be hit by every snowball thrown at them during the ride. 

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM - the target would be doing flips in the air, totally stun-locked.

So we would lurk around the station, wait till some poor, unsuspecting player got on, get on the last tram car and start pelting snowballs at them. I'm laughing right now thinking about it. 

Also we discovered that if you threw a snowball at a target at the moment they mounted a taxi bird, the snowballs would hit them as soon as they landed - anywhere. 

And blizzard stopped it.. such a bummer. 




 I have a very strong suspicion that all of these new people Activision hired are people who have never actually been able to afford to play the game. Maybe in India or another code sweatshop type operation.  




 You reminded me of [this.](http://i.imgur.com/WkD6yNt.jpg).

My second toon I made a few months after beta -she ended up being a 19 twink and had her little rogue partner (usually my daughter or hubby at the helm of that one.)

Best story I have is;

"Back in the day, mages had unlimited sheeps on the battleground. You also had set battlegroups and would regularly play against the same players.

One day this Troll was speed hacking (a method where they would dc quickly/repeatedly and lag the game for other players) and we caught him alone in a hut on WSG. So I repeat sheeped his ass in the hut while my rogue partner stunlocked and killed everything that tried to come rescue him. 

We laughed ourselves into hysterics. 

Next time we encountered him we did the same thing. From then on out - until they changed the battlegroup system, it was game-on between me and him in every bg we ended up in together.  




 Leveled 3 100's. The rest of my alts I have locked at 90. Not going there. Unsubbing before my next pay date. 




 That's because old school players are accustomed to getting things like Ulduar, Firelands, new zones, Emerald Dream Dragons and Blackrock in a patch. Not selfie cameras. 




 Maybe he is a blizz employee. 




 I am not referring to the 'floating dead' aspect. I am referring to the lack of education, regulation and poverty that let's this continue.

Corporate/Banking groups (mostly multinationals now) are spending millions lobbying for low wages, ending the EPA, ending pollution regulations, ending work safety regulations, destroying what is left of labor power, ending supplemental health care, etc.

This is all part of the "Make gub'ment smaller!" movement.

The result of this, if they are successful, is exactly what you see in India and Bangladesh. Very few ultra rich at the top, wholly unregulated (who never see these streets) and masses of people in poverty.

EDIT: If you have an alternate point to make, man up and debate this instead of dv it. 
 




 Believe it or not- poor people in America are shitting in the streets now. They just haven't been doing it long enough yet to do it in the open. 




 Uh huh? 

How about a debate?

 Everything you said, and:

Second, ungate professions. Put fixed gem slots back on gear. Give us our enchants back. I don't understand why reforging, meta gems, and most enchant slots were removed. I LIKED having to invest some time and resources into my character. These days, getting gear is boring as hell.

I will add; "Slow Down", and reserve Heirloom gear to a few slots, like trinkets, gloves and belts.

Leveling speed and ease is ridiculous. Now there is no reason to level professions, because why bother to slot a gem or enchant or make a piece of gear you or your customer will only use for a couple of hours? This also means none of the made items can sell on the AH. When leveling and moving through new areas/dungeons was challenging, these items were important. Now you never die.

So now there is no reason to revisit old raids and dungeons where rare patterns drop. Or travel to different areas to farm materials, gain various faction rep for some recipes and make special items. That's a huge chunk of the game that is just gone.

I have 10 yr old toons with enchanting, alchemy, leatherworking, who have rare and very cool old school recipes that are now worthless. There was no reason to take this away from players- and it is a slap in the face of those who have invested time and money. 




 A few stacks of dynamite and a bic.  




 Go through the old patches from back in the day. Every few months brought major new content: http://www.wowwiki.com/Patches/1.x

At bottom of the page you can click on 2.x, 3.x etc to see those patches.  




 10 yr player. I already feel burned.  




 The farm was cute- but anti-social and had nothing personalized about it. Fixing just those two things and anchoring it in SW or IF (for ally) would have been awesome. For personalization you could get plaques with achieves or pics of some of your fav screenshots on the walls.  




 They did not give us exactly what we wanted. What we requested was the option to have a 'place' that we could bring others into; up to and including our guild members. That's all. 

We didn't want mind numbing missions that virtual followers would go adventuring on. We wanted missions that our groups/guild would go adventuring on. We didn't want them to kill professions along the way, either. 




 Never did buy this. Wow is not a 'closed ended' game that you 'finish'. I remember we (me and my beta partners) deliberately took our time to level up- no rush. Why should there be? We wanted to explore - quest and see *everything* the game offered. 

This whole 'people too busy now to play long time' is a fallacy that has led blizz to believe everyone needs to be able to lvl to max in a week, when we took months.  




 Content content content. This is why wow was exciting:

 Flourishing? I am ready to start inventing recipes. Shrimp Chips, anyone? 

I am not sure. This is a non co2, planted tank that has an Eco Complete substrate (20b) layered with some natural sand / dirt from the river out back (Sierra glacial stream) + fluorite (20lb). 

ph 7. Other parameters good. Temp around 77-78. 10-15% water change once a week or so. I use a little flourish once a month + plant tabs at base of larger plants. 

I have several different kinds of mosses- normal java moss, subwassertang and some mini fissidens that I got to attach to the castle roof.

They eat whatever they can scavenge plus 3 algae tabs 2-3x a week. Wardley Pleco tabs- aspirin sized ones. 

The shrimp were a couple of baby hitchhikers that came in on a little bundle of plants. Took me a while to figure out where they came from.

Now I have a colony in my low tech 29 bowfront. Must have hitchhiked over when I was moving / trimming plants. 




 You are saying we torture animals because some people are egotistical, arrogant dumbasses.

Gotcha  




 The top line (8 degrees) is if we do nothing at all.

The other two values (2 and 4 degrees) are what we get with slowing and stopping carbon fuel burning combined with a massive, global geoengineering program to recapture CO2 using technology that hasn't been invented yet. 

None of these take methane release due to melt or any other feedback mechanism into account.

 Your post just gave me a flash remembrance of something I read decades ago. Just now looked it up and it is how I remembered it. 

 In Russia there comes the hope of the world, not as that sometimes termed of the communistic, or Bolshevik, no; but freedom, freedom! That each man will live for his fellow man! The principle has been born. It will take years for it to be crystallised, but out of Russia comes again the hope of the world. (1944) No. 3976-29
Edgar Cayce.

Now when he spoke this and even when I read it (in the 70's) Russia was the great evil on the earth.  




 I have noticed the ones that use that word the most are the ones who ultimately vote to keep the most unpatriotic things in place. With the GOP stacking congress/senate we are screwed. 




 This is the entire point to developing a fascist system. And it is exactly why they get entrenched and are hard to remove. 




 The whole 'bad women' and 'crazy feminists' stories started hitting about 6 months ago. Right about the time Hilary started hinting at a run for office. I believe it is deliberate astroturfing by GOP PR groups.  




 Zero growth rates are only a part of the equation. [Right now we are on track toward an 8 degree C warming.](https://youtu.be/8akSfOIsU2Y) That's a planet killer. Right now the 'survivable' 2 degree mark relies on development of a carbon sequestration technology that doesn't exist and isn't even being worked on by any scientific organization or country.  




 I think we should make them all use tin cans with string. 
And we can take their drivers licenses and cars away. And make them wear flour sacks with a yellow 'P' (for Peon) sewn on so we can tell them from the real citizens. Then once they are completely castigated from the rest of society we can put them in labor camps.  









 All mosses can help with the nitrate cycle. Marimo is just a lot of cleaning packed into a small ball.

Get a tiny heater, plenty of plants- a little java moss. In this one the heater is under the substrate. 




 One option is to get a couple of java/marimo moss balls to keep in the tank. http://www.fishlore.com/fishforum/aquarium-plants/103662-what-point-moss-ball.html

It will help your tank re-cycle and in the future help prevent another crash if you lose power again. 




 It is wonderful to see goldfish in a proper environment. These guys have suffered from so much disinformation over the years it's mind boggling.

 Thank you Kate. I was wondering about that this morning.  




 So weird how the second the word 'nuclear' is in a post there are suddenly more comments than usual - pretty rapidly too.

I have actually tested this on long dead threads and seen an influx of nuclear supportive type comments within minutes.

 Hi. The 'lacy' moss is plain Java moss tied on with cotton thread. By the time the cotton rots away the moss is imbedded on the driftwood. The little grassy plant is a micro sword. 

The floating plants are common duckweed (Lemnia Minor) and Miniature Water Lettuce (Pistea). The water lettuce has the longer roots. 

Red plant- as long as lighting and fert. requirements are met, Alternanthera Reineckii var. mini is nice. If it gets too big just trim it. I have the large type in the big tank. Another option is a mini Cryptocoryne. They tend to be more brown than red usually.

The thing with red plants is the proper fertilizer balance to maintain the color. 

Also- none of my tanks have Co2. I cover them during the day with fitted plexiglass and run a light bubbler at night.  




 Thank you! I started working at it when I was 12. Started a couple of other businesses some years ago but I will always be a hobby keeper. It is living art.

 Anubias are low light plants. Even though some lights look bright to the human eye, the key for plants is the correct spectrum. This is also a very deep tank, which is going to make a big difference on your lighting needs. 

Also Anubias don't need the correct strata for rooting. 

If you want a planted tank, a few suggestions.

Make sure you have the correct base for them to root in.

Research lighting and apply it (could be a bit expensive).

Research fertilizers and apply. (also slightly expensive).

Don't keep soft plant eating fish if you want plants such as anacharis. 

You can never add too many plants at once. Stock it up. 

10 hours of lighting will lead to an algae nightmare. No more than 5 hours of correct spectrum lighting a day. 

Otherwise you can stick with low light plants, such as anubias. Research low light plants if you plan on only having two tubes on the tank. 

Definitely change out your bulbs for a plant spectrum bulbs, regardless. 




 Here's the deal with 'hungry' fish. Since they have to hunt for food most of their waking hours (in the wild) just to stay alive, they do not have a 'shut off' switch in their brain telling them that they are 'full' -like humans do. They don't need one. 

Since you are artificially feeding them please ignore the begging if you know they are actually eating every day. Check bellies after dinner. Unfortunately, consistent food begging by fish has killed more than I like to think about.  




 Very pretty! Nice job. And bettas never hold still. Had to figure out high speed settings to take pics of my fish. 




 /u/msgreyson got it. One more thing with mystery deaths to check is cleaning products. Turn off filters before using heavily scented or odorous cleaning products, dust spray, bleach, ammonia, etc. Always make sure soap is rinsed off the hands before contact with tank water.  




 Do you have a water softener?

One thing you can do is add a very small piece of (dead and bleached) branching coral to the tank to add a bit more naturally dissolved calcium. About an inch per 10g. You can also add a level teaspoon of pure epsom salts per 20g. This can help with snails with thin shells as well. Just keep an eye on your ph. 




 Beautiful! Wonderful that you have given them a proper habitat.

I was working at Byerly's when these were first imported to the states. Back then only males in breeding mode would color that nicely.  




 Because people get mad when you fuck with their internal fantasy worlds? Ya thanks, was in the tropical/salt fish business for 30 yrs. 




 Bet you fed the guinea pig lettuce.  
























 It's a new defense called *The Firing Squad* defense. 

If you have 13 people shooting at someone - make sure the other 12 get off on lesser charges (or no charges) and throw the book at the 13th (to calm the mob). 

Then when the 13th person goes to trial the prosecutor can shrug and say 'We don't know beyond reasonable doubt if *this* guys bullet is the one that killed the victim".

So make sure if you ever go to commit murder to bring at least 12 friends along. Apparently in America it's a "Get out of Jail Free' card now, seeing as it is enshrined in precedence.  




 I stated:

 If you think that running from the police should automatically mean a public execution, on the spot, maybe you are in the wrong country.

 Never heard of 'roid rage'? Seriously. 

Of growing concern to physicians and psychologists is the mounting evidence that anabolic /androgenic steroids cause severe and sometimes permanent mental disorders. The addictive nature of steroids often leads users to administer progressively higher doses and more exotic combinations of the drugs to maintain and increase the initial muscle building effects.

***Abundant clinical and anecdotal evidence suggests that steroids often lead to unusually aggressive and irrational behavior.***

And using steroids isn't a problem for a guy who straps on a gun every day and goes out to deal with the public?

Just using a little common sense here.

 The really sickening thing about this case is this. I have relatives in medicine- one is a coroner. He has autopsied 2 'hero' police officers killed in the line of duty. Both of them had cocaine in their systems. One exhibited long term steroid use. 




 You forgot a 0.

By the narrowest measure possible  in which we give police every benefit of the cause of death doubt in incidents where they Tasered or restrained suspects  85 percent of the sampled incidents were the sort of police killings the government might be expected to keep track of. If we include other arrest-related deaths (and theyre included in Bureau of Justice figures), then 93 percent of incidents qualified as police killings.

Applying these percentages to the total count at Killed By Police would imply that officers acting in the line of duty have killed in the neighborhood of 1,250 to 1,350 people since May 1, 2013. Thats about 1,000 deaths per year.

 113?

 It is *exactly* like saying "it's ok". It sets court precedent that automatically justifies future shootings, chokings, beatings, etc by the police.  




 One thing that everyone seems to overlook here. Every single one of these cases in which a cop is found not guilty of killing a civilian stacks the deck on precedence in a court of law. 

If this keeps up, police will be able to show justification in any court of law for killing anyone for any reason- due to precedence of prior case law. 

And it won't matter what color you are. 




 I have one issue with the mannequin element. There were 5 shots to the womans head that was not on the mannequin for some reason. 




 officer reported that was not the case and at 10:47 p.m. radioed: Passenger just put his hands out asking us to stop. He does not have a gun. He has black gloves on, the officer said, according to the transcript.

Theres a red pop can in his hand.

 It was a plainclothes cop in an unmarked vehicle attempting to pull them over for not using a turn signal. That's what started them running. 

If some stranger in street clothes tried to get you to pull over, would you?

 Pine nuts are the little seeds between the 'shells' on the pine cone. Take a fully dried but fresh pine cone (like just off the tree for a week or two) and hit it hard on something- they fly out. Pine nuts sell for about 12-15 bucks a lb around here.

Washoe   Paiute Indians [make pastes and flour out of it](http://travelnevada.com/sites/default/files/styles/rotator_detail/public/field/image/PineNuts_Paiute.jpg?itok=py4U05Og) and you can eat them raw like regular nuts. Delicious and very good for you. 




 On a related note, my kitten can't hunt.

Obviously he CAN CATCH TREE BABIES. Of course he can hunt. 




 You see about the end of the Harry Potter segment the other band just leave like fuck this y'all can have it.

 This is why old people look like hell. All the hugs. 




 Obviously the point of the matter isn't the deed, but the *justice* or *injustice* of the deed combined with viewers personal immersion with the character.

You are trying to shift the point of the matter to fit some pre-defined political stance.

People *did* go out of their minds at the Red Wedding - because of perceived injustice toward innocent people. 

People *didn't* go out of their minds with the golden crown scene, because the brother was a violent, stupid dick who sold his little sister to barbarians.

People *did* go out of their minds when Ned was beheaded, because it was unjust. 

People *didn't* go out of their minds when Ramsey (justly, give or take) tortured Theon, because Theon killed or had killed hundreds of innocent people who were nearly family, including 2 little boys.

Sansa? It wouldn't matter if she were raped or had her hand cut off or was flayed or poked in the eye with a pin. 

It wasn't the *details* of the act that mattered. It was the *unjust* violence against this wholly innocent girl who has been with viewers since the beginning- and who has already been through total hell. 

Capiche? 




 Of course we didn't. Point being that nature has managed to generate an exquisitely balanced series of symbiotic relationships within biological and geographical systems that functioned pretty damn well before humans came along. And will continue to do so long after we are gone- if we don't succeed in utterly wiping it out.

To imagine that nature 'needs' us to keep things straightened out is the height of arrogance. 




 Santa Barbara did a study on coyotes killed because they had become urbanized  - autopsies to check their dietary habits. Out of 200 coyotes they found that 80% of their diet was rodents. Rats, wild rabbits, mice and shrews. The rest was mainly garbage. No cats. No dogs. 




  Coyotes only expanded to most of the United States relatively recently, and as a result of us killing off wolves. 

You just made my point. You kill off an apex predator- another will come along and fill its place. "Nature balancing itself out." And the prey animals, rodents to deer, will overpopulate until that occurs. 
 




 Ok I'll make this clearer.

Bob kills 100 people, including 2 little kids. He gets the death penalty. 

Everyone shrugs.

An innocent, 15 year old girl does nothing wrong. She gets the death penalty.

Everyone raises hell.

Obviously the point of the matter isn't the *death penalty*, but the *injustice*.

 Sansa is a naive child who has been pretty much harmless her whole life. She lost her entire family in horrible ways and has been used as a pawn for 3 years.

The man Ramsey mutilated and tortured killed most of the people of Winterfell, men, women and children that he grew up with, including his teacher and weapons master - then had two innocent children killed and bodies burned to hang on the wall - in front of people who loved them (they didn't know they were farmers boys)

So of course peoples sympathies are with Sansa. Peoples sympathies are always with the innocent. Has nothing to do with sex.

 If Nature doesn't always balance itself out- what the hell happened before these oh-so-wise humans showed up?
 




 That's an important point. People got to know each other. You couldn't server hop, no blended servers. To ninja or act like an asshole back in the old days would get you shunned. 




 I lived in a hay growing area in NV. One year the good ole boys had a 3 day coyote hunt. For 3 years afterwards they lost tons of hay to Jackrabbits.

Coyotes are native to every state in the US. Best to leave shit the hell alone. It will balance itself out. That's what nature does.  




 I saw what someone else posted to the wow forum and it was right on. http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17346427864

 I would flawlessly recreate the Vanilla servers. The only elements of new content I would add is reforging and transmogging. Besides these, this game would follow the original game, right through WotLK. No LFR or LFD. No player/server phasing. Recreating the sense of community is a goal here.
 
 Other content that was hinted at, but not followed through with, would be added; like the Emerald Dream. This would extend the time frame of events and add new content within the old framework. 
 
 It would be available to all players for a one time fee of $10, same for returning players. And I can guarantee there will be returning players, millions of them. So many would come just to see the Emerald Dream fulfilled.
 
 Upon log-in players would have the normal choices of servers and characters- but with an added choice upon making a new character- in Vanilla. This would be the fork in the road that players who paid the $10 fee could choose.
 
 This would not eliminate the new game, it would still be available for ez mode players. 

This would make me so goddam happy. 




 I saw this yesterday and posted it to reddit.  I would immediately drop $10 make a new toon on this and never look back.

 Blackrock chain running- actually sparked my fear of heights. I would hold my breath all the way.

I just realized how badly lfr/lfg impacts immersion.  




 These weren't created when we started. It was full on guild run to the dungeon. Damn those were fun times- killing shit along the way. 




 I noticed [this chart of subscriber stats](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/) just yesterday and noticed that the downward turn started in '10. Right about the time lfr/lfg started.
I wondered about a connection, seeing as lfr lfg had such a huge impact on player experience. 




 I loved ST. Hate what they did to it.  




 Traveling to get to the dungeon was the first half of the adventure.  




 But they were pretty much color coded shortly after release. 




 Is there such a thing as power leveling any more? You can sleepwalk through it and it happens so fast you barely see half of the world.

Not in Europe.

 Funny story about LBJ.

A very good friend of my mothers was the (young, pretty) widow of a gentlemen who had been in French politics. She and her dead husbands brother were invited to a dinner party at a major hotel after a diplomatic meeting in France and LBJ and his retinue was there. Things got drunkenly boisterous and flirtatious as the evening went on and she eventually retired to her suite.

An hour later she answered a knock at her door and there stood LBJ, in a silk bathrobe with a bottle of champagne, a bouquet of flowers and a huge cigar- with two secret service men flanking him.

He said "Madame, your President has come to pay you a call."

And she let him in.

When he left in the wee hours the secret service men were still standing there outside of the room.

She said he "was not pretty, but he was very persuasive". 




 Early 40's through late 70's. They raised 4 children. They bought one home and then they had a large home built in the mid '50s on 10 acres. They took two week (or longer) vacations every year. They could have been the poster children for "The American Dream"

It had a strong union. I remember my grandfather going out the door to a strike with a lead-filled baseball bat. And he was white collar system designer.

My grandfather had briefly played for the Pittsburgh Steelers (back injury) and my grandmother was a Rosie the Riveter who got her degree between having babies.

They retired before NAFTA - after which the plant moved manufacturing overseas. 




 "**The question is whether it would make them fear for their safety, or the safety of those around them..**

[A criminal threat,](http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/criminal-threats.htm) sometimes known as the terrorist threat, malicious harassment, or by other terms, occurs when someone threatens to kill or physically harm someone else.
 




 
Sure people need electricians, etc. But who is going to design the systems in the first place? 




 The only reason we won WW2 was because of our massive and innovative manufacturing base. We needed a large number of educated people to design, innovate and create for those manufacturers. 

Now we cannot even make umbrellas. 

WW3 is not going to be won by ranks of baristas and we cannot maintain superpower status with herds of burger flippers.

The US produced large quantities of military equipment into late 1945, including nuclear weapons, and became one of the strongest, most technically advanced military forces in the world. In addition to out-producing the Axis, the Allies produced technological innovations including radar (instrumental in winning the Battle of Britain), sonar (improving their ability to sink U-boats), the atomic bomb (eliminated the need to invade Japan) and the proximity fuze. Five times as effective as contact or timed fuzes, the latter was devastating in naval use against Japanese aircraft and so effective against German ground troops that General George S. Patton said it "won the Battle of the Bulge for us."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_production_during_World_War_II 




 My grandparents worked for a major appliance manufacturer here in the states. They both had degrees and would not have had their positions without them. 

It's not that we have too many people with college degrees, we no longer have an innovative, massive manufacturing base to support them. This is what needs to change. 




 I know someone who works for them- this melt is exactly what they have been waiting and planning for so they can move in to drill.

 How about the best Pranks Blizzard ever played?
 
Corrupted Blood Plague (actually a glitch- but funnier than hell, regardless). https://youtu.be/RxDvxKeLWlA 
We would actually go fight Hakkar just to port hunters back to main cities to spread this. 

DK Plague:
https://youtu.be/7DUzJklzJ0Y?t=13s

And the Zombie Plague (actually part of the scourge invasion):
https://youtu.be/zdT3Tert6DQ 




 Under a 14 yr old boys bed. 




 One of the main ones was kiting dragons and mini bosses to main cities. 

Blizzard ended up tethering them. But the fun and excitement of doing it- or other people doing it and the spontaneous mini raids that would form to kill it were part of the excitement of 'whats going to happen today?' when you logged on. 

The last one I was able to kite was Shan Bu to the Emperors Step. Someone forgot to tether him or they thought it couldn't be done. He stayed there through the weekend until re-set. 

Album: http://imgur.com/a/4vqEV

The other prank, also removed, was snowballs. 

[This was hysterically funny.](http://i.imgur.com/eA2QeC0.jpg)

When they first made snowballs in the game the victim would flip over onto it's back. Everyone loved them. 

Also, as I discovered when my friends and I went to have a snowball fight on the SW/IF Tram, snowballs travelled at exactly the same speed as the tram. So the result was that once they got off the tram they would be hit by every snowball thrown at them during the ride. 

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM - the target would be doing flips in the air, totally stun-locked.

So we would lurk around the station, wait till some poor, unsuspecting player got on, get on the last tram car and start pelting snowballs at them. I'm laughing right now thinking about it. They would fly through the air- same speed as the tram - and all catch up once the victim got off the tram.

Also we discovered that if you threw a snowball at a target at the *moment* they mounted a taxi bird, the snowballs would hit them as soon as they landed - anywhere. Took exquisite timing. Best was when you and a friend were going to taxi somewhere- let them mount while you pelt them. The cursing in pm when they landed .. freaking hilarious. 

And blizzard stopped it.. such a bummer. 




 Holy shit you don't know what you are talking about.

'talking about'? I am looking at a graph that is basically in a constant state of plummet, besides a few bumps, since end of WotLK. 




 Interesting, LFR and LFD were rolled out between 2009 (lfd) and 2011 (lfr) - about the time that blizz had 11-12 million subscribers. 

By Q2, 2012 they had dropped to 9 million subscribers. So that's pretty damn interesting. The only times it has come up above that number is briefly during expac releases before going down again.

Hell, maybe it did kill the game.
 




 So basically it is losing a million subscribers a month. Unless they do something drastically imaginative, the game is dead by fall. 




  the biggest rise of subscribers ever?

Do you have a link for this? I don't know of any 'rise'.  If it were different, you would not have stated this:

normal servers are already struggling.

I know of a lot of players who came back, hopeful, then left again.

Here's the numbers: https://youtu.be/8dOsT8x6iy8
 




 From your post of 6 days ago:

Yeah, but Lich King dropped a weapon for every spec and class. Therefore, all players had access to slightly higher item level weapons and no specific classes were left out. Same with Spine/Madness in Dragon Soul - between the two bosses, all classes had access to a weapon/trinket of the same ilevel to their peers. 




 Normal servers are struggling to maintain a player base after losing millions of players due to WoD. This could refresh that player base. 

If you didn't like Vanilla, that's fine. You don't need to play it. A lot of people did and still do love it. I know a lot of old school players- all but two of us are on WotLK servers. As one of them put it "If Blizzard won't do it, someone will (and has)."

ps How did you get from Vanilla to WoD unless you played it through? If so- it obviously wasn't 'bad'. If you never played it- how would you know? 




 Thank god people blinded by nostalgia can't decide what Blizzard does or doesnt do.

If you enjoy WoD, how would this impact your game? 

I think the post is brilliant. It takes nothing away from the current game, while giving a lot of people what they want. You have a personal problem with that?

I have watched players unsub for months now and know more old player friends who are now on WotLK rogue servers than in the official game.  









 I like how you put that; 'chupacabra'. 

It was while studying the Jarrell that I first discovered Gravity Waves in relation to amping up storms. I have a fascination with resonant waves and effects so it is very interesting.

I had heard of Jarrell, but had not really studied it until during the 2011 outbreak one of the tornados took a 'backward' track and I went into research mode. I cannot recall which tornado that was now. 

Thank you for your info. I did not know the other tornados you mentioned were also linked to gravity waves. 




 Except for the Republican crabs, who all sit around and chant 'DOWN WITH SOCIALISM!' as they slowly strangulate. 




 Unbelievable that we have gotten to the point of nearly killing off our prime pollinator. Sometimes I feel like I have stepped into a different dimension. A bad one.  




 In Ohio my mother was married to a top end blacksmith. He did ortho horse shoeing with a veterinarian. He had an aussie named Sassy and Sassy would sit on a stool in front of the horses, literally calming them to the point that they looked hypnotized. 

 This was good because he would have to work on them for longer than standard shoeing would take. 

Very smart dogs. 




 ..potential to be really, really bad had there been any sort of population center in the way.

Like Philadelphia, MS.

I am very sorry to hear about your illness. I hope you get through it quickly and come out the other side better than ever. When you are feeling up to finishing your posts, I'll be here if you want to chat. Meanwhile, lovely to meet you and welcome to StormComing :) Message me any time. 




 Thank you for this information. I will look into this event, it seems extraordinary. 

I have had a serious love/hate relationship with tornados since 1974. I was 14 and lived just outside of Xenia. 

I had just asked on /r/stormchaser if you were *the* stormstalker of the blog. I am so glad you are. I am a big fan of your blog. It's extremely well written. If you ever have any questions about Xenia,  I'm available. I remember it very well and possibly remember a few things that haven't been written about. Like the 're-planted tree' in a neighbors field.  




 Are you StormStalker from https://stormstalker.wordpress.com? 




 Possibly more like the Mussolini style of Fascism. Where certain corporations ruled the government- and quietly kept competitors subdued.

 What is it called when corporations have to get permission from the government to sell something? Let's see.. it's not capitalist.. must be a word for it.

 Besides, Japan hates those fascist bastards. 




 schooling
skooliNG/
noun
education or training received, especially at school.
"his parents paid for his schooling"
synonyms: education, teaching, tuition, instruction, tutoring, tutelage; 

In the late 18th century, Thomas Paine was amongst the earliest proponents of universal, free public education, which was considered to be a radical idea at the time.

Apparently, for some who want us to go back to those days of uneducated masses and slavery, it's still a radical idea.  




 Of course you know that a tornado can double back when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core. In this case I believe it had to do with the massive gravity wave to the south east -that generated a strong pocket of localized shear as well. 

If I seem wrong on any of this, please correct me. I am always learning. 




 That's another option- trees or bushes ripped out of the ground, leaving holes. Pretty brilliant actually.  




 Report to whom? The priest was a priest for a corrupt police dept.  




 Yes, I suppose we don't need all of this silly edumacation, seeing as it has done nothing for U.S. advancement in the world. Yep. Education, business development, scientific research leading to technology breakthroughs, maintaining a lead on other countries, etc. is all just something we should be cutting costs on.
 




 Did you ever go up into Jarrell? 




 Have you seen the video of the Philadelphia MS ground scouring? 

https://youtu.be/AcIqU6w-_04 

This was thought to be created by sub vortices within the main. 

I will revisit a map and images to see the orientation. 




  They deserve the "college experience" right?

Actually our country deserves to have the brightest kids with the best education moving out into business creation and the workforce. Our former high levels of affordable education is what grew this country in the first place. As it fails- so does the country.

 




 Yes, apparently it was at 2mph when it hit Double Creek. I was thinking that possibly those divots were from surface removal - apparently they also had to remove top layers for recovery purposes in some areas. The clearly circular patterns, though, seem odd for this.

Also, the [gravity wave effect study](http://homepages.vvm.com/%7Ecurtis/Jarrell/Jarrell.htm) is fascinating in regards to 'backward motion' and the low shear, high CAPE of that day. I had just posted a story on /r/StormComing on this http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/36azjw/the_incredible_jarrell_tx_tornado_probably_one_of/

  




 That's a possibility. I am going to scan more aerial tornado damage images to see if I can find anything similar.  




  no one (read: employers) in America will recognize your school.

And why would anyone want to go back to work in America?

Germany: The law requires a minimum of 20 paid days of vacation annually, but some companies give much more than that, sometimes as much as 30 paid days.

Paid sick leave is six weeks, during which you will continue to receive your full salary. After that time, health insurance pays 70% of your last salary until you either return to work or have to retire because of your health.

Mothers are allowed six weeks leave at full pay prior to the childs birth and eight weeks at full pay afterward. The mother or father is then allowed up to three years of unpaid leave to stay at home with the child.  




 We adopted 2 young sister cats - both preggers. They gave birth within 6 hours of each other. We had set up a long clothes closet for them to do this and have privacy- one cat at each end. Within a day one of the cats had moved to the other end with the sister and sisters kittens. 11 total. Thereafter it was just one big nursing cat/kitten pile. I don't even think they knew whose was whose after a while. 




 Thanks. I was thinking the same- about the spacing and regularity. They just look very odd. 




 I know 4 'top tier' Americans currently studying abroad, and one more getting ready to go to Germany.. Americans studying abroad has become, once more, the thing. Mostly because of the high cost of native universities.

And once there - a lot of them decide they want to stay. One of my friends ended up with the Berlin Orchestra and married. Another is currently at Oxford, teaching.

Do you happen to have statistics of what you claimed? Europeans coming to American Universities in droves? And students from third world countries do not count. They are escaping a bad situation as much as anything. 




 I have noticed in several ground 'after' pictures of the Jarrell TX May 27 - 1997 there are these odd round circles on the ground. I am familiar with cycloidal arcing, drag marks, etc. but don't recall seeing these before in tornado damage images until Jarrell. 

https://extremeplanet.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/jt-dc-1.png

Is it possible, since Jarrell was a multi-vortex, that these are touchdown 'suction' marks from small vortices within the larger body? They seem very tightly clustered. I just can't figure out what else they could be. 




 Ok if american tax payers are so fucking tight fisted- the smart kids will go to other countries and they will benefit.

 The class capable of chipping in is a ten ton elephant at this point - and since it is the 'job creating' class it will benefit the most.  




 You know what? Fuck Chase Bank   Wells Fargo, fuck the brain drain they have created, fuck high college tuition rates. 

"...the German government fully funds the education of its citizens -- and even of foreigners."

"..Finland charges no tuition fees, and it offers a large number of university programs in English.

"French University programs charge only a small tuition fee of about 200 dollars for most programs (covers everything but off campus living situations).

"Norwegian universities do not charge tuition fees for international students. 

So fuck the banks and any kind of possible excuse you can come up with for them.  




 College finance loans were originally designed to be non-crippling- at 1-2% interest when I was in college.  




 Thank god maybe we can start catching up with the rest of the civilized world. 




 The Jarrell Tornado has also been called the Dead Man Walking tornado from [this image.](http://lssn.us/image/JARREL~1.png)

By the time it passed through Jarrell, Tx. it had cleanly removed yards of asphalt from the road. Fragments of human victims were mixed with bits of formerly living livestock. Human chains of recovery personnel slowly moved across the landscape, combing through mud and debris for every trace of remains that could be retrieved for identification and burial.

The Jarrell tornado had another unique identifier, [it actually reversed course at one time- moving 'backward'.](http://homepages.vvm.com/~curtis/Jarrell/Jarrell.htm) 

In my years of experience in studying storms the Jarrell tornado is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, of tornados spawned in the United States.

 That's a very crafty bird right there. 




 Don't get too relieved. We had laying hens and I had a few that I raised from the egg. When I would come out and sit on the porch they would come running up and compete for lap room, just like small dogs. One would lay her head up on my chest for a cuddle. No food involved. Just feathery cuddles and low cooing noises. 




 Did that with my Warcraft account 10 yrs ago. 

So this year they sent an ugly Orc statue to some poor asshole at a pizza place in downtown Detroit.

 Maybe they were just waiting till Affirmative Action laws were overturned. Save on reprinting. 




 I knew Lisa Levys family (She was one of Ted Bundy's victims at the Florida sorority house). Her father was of no certain religion, but very spiritual in nature. He wrote letters asking for life instead of the death penalty for Bundy.  




 ... and bought a dozen donuts and a gallon of milk.  




 She blew him.. but he didn't give her the Coup de Nom? Even if she knew the phone was ringing...  




 Of course .. there would have been a *Juicy Couture* sign under it if it were for the prepubescent set. 




 And just how many porn sites do you cruise in a day? 

..and 'letting'? Is your wife/girlfriend like..12? 




 Actually laughed out loud
 









  This time, though, Maskell didn't bring Wehner home. He navigated his car past the Catholic hospital and industrial buildings that surrounded Keoughs campus and drove toward the outskirts of the city. Eventually, he stopped at a garbage dump, far from any homes or businesses. Maskell stepped out of the car, and the blonde, freckled teenager followed him across a vast expanse of dirt toward a dark green dumpster.
 
 It was then that she saw the body crumpled on the ground.

 Socialism as in collective buying in order to streamline, save money and improve efficiency. Unlike the American Consumer model where everyone is expected to buy their own 'thing'.

Wealthy people and corporations practice this type of socialism on a daily basis. If you ever spent time in a wealthy neighborhood you will soon see that none of them own a lawnmower. They all use mower services. And most corporations have a fleet of cars that are used by mid-level management on up. 

It's only the lower classes who are discouraged from this by accusations of 'socialism'.  




 Another part that they missed- the part after they are 'raptured'.

The Apostles ask Jesus where they will all go and he answers:

 Where, Lord?" they asked Him. He said to them, "Where the corpse is, there also the vultures will be gathered." 

Luke 17:37 




 We should have left Saddam and his wood chipper the hell alone. 









 Thing is, Saddam was a Secularist and a lot of the folks that were in his 'torture prisons' were hard core islamists who wanted Iraq to toe the line with the rest of the Islamic fundamentalist nations. Some of the IS that were captured had spent time there. 




 in 25-50 years, they'll just say "Who could have known? The science wasn't in."

People are already [on to that one:](http://i.imgur.com/xNc31Or.jpg) 




 If you think about it- if the GOP got every single wish fulfilled - the US would resemble Bangladesh in a few years. 




 The U.S. Military is one of the most 'socialist' organizations on earth. No one seems to notice that part though. 




 Somehow they missed the last chapters:

The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. **The time has come** for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small-- and **for destroying those who destroy the earth."**

Rev. 11:18 




 She looks incredible. T'would take a brave man to climb that tree. 




 Damn. Glad I only got sheep. 




 My gynecologist, when I passed one and took it in to him. If I hadn't used a pad that night because of a particularly heavy, late period I would never have known. 




 Feminists? Probably over 80% of the really nasty posters were men jumping on a bandwagon. I'm a feminist. That makes no sense at all. 




 You came in 'making claims'. So according to the rules, you first. I'll drop back in after I go have some wine and kill some orcs.  




 And they are dealing with this along with the Meningitis outbreak. . man, what a mess. 




 It got cold as hell in the mountains today and started spitting snow.. brrr! 




 Thank you. I have had a habit of growing my annuals from seed for a long time. Much more fun that way. 




 Hey! I was right in the framing of that statement. You had me second guessing myself for a minute there. 

[Prey Animals](http://digital-desert.com/wildlife/prey.html)

The term prey refers to an animal that is sought, captured, and eaten by a predator. A predator is an animal that hunts and kills other animals for food in an act called predation. Smaller predators, such as mice and lizards can be, and often are, prey for larger predators. 




 High school debate?

...it says with big, innocent eyes. 

Give it up dude. Basic statistics already wrap all the things you tried to state into a big bullshit burrito and flush it into a cesspool of hyperbole.  




 High School level debate team? Declarative statements based on fallacy and framed as questions are very overused, boring and blatant. Find a new trick.  




 I detest the ultra conservative republican party- and I detest Fabian Socialists. Hilary is a Fabian. Just praying for a Bernie win. Or we are pretty much fucked.  




 60's through the 70's - greatest years in America.  




 To the point that I am ready to move to Italy. 




 Prey animals i.e.: predators prey on them. But maybe I got the .. nm. fml 




 Take it from a one time endurance rider: it's done all of the time, regularly, over rough terrain. Horses are prey animals who have developed great night vision.

 Nah. We just [keep on riding till we get to the cemetery.](https://youtu.be/FIXlNsNi32g?t=51s) 




 This is why I really do wish for a God to deal with assholes after death.. cause they sure don't seem to be dealt with here on earth. 




  I was wondering what was so NSFW about a tornado. Brazil just had one last week. 




 There are.. in Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands, UK etc.

Just not in the [U.S.](http://consumer.healthday.com/senior-citizen-information-31/senior-citizen-news-778/u-s-seniors-health-poorest-global-survey-shows-693917.html?lexp=true utm_expid=38353063-4.pIV1hUrQR8K_MJ1_OqjLag.1 utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) 

 




 I got hooked on trains when I had to go to Chicago from San Fran. I had the time and something about it just seemed appealing. I figured if I didn't like it I would get off in a major city and hop a plane. 

I got a cute little sleeper (came with three great meals a day) and I loved every second of it. It was like a mini vacation and was almost the same price as flying. That decided me. 




 I had a friend who lived near a private area used as a shooting/training range for the Michigan Militia.

If they started shooting before 6 am he used to aim his speakers out the upstairs window and blast the Barney Song. 




 I live in a resort area and have to go to san fran regularly. I used to drive it- utter nightmare. Now I take a nice bus to the train, have breakfast on the train, catch up on emails, Skype, prep for meetings. Get off refreshed and ready to go. It's wonderful; and cheaper than supporting a car. 




  Mussolini, who is credited with creating fascism, often said that fascist governments should be "corporatist" regimes, essentially ones that were run entirely by companies and the elites of society.

Fred Koch, father of the Koch Bros helped Mussolini develop this style of Fascism. Then came back to the US to spread it here via the John Birch Society and, apparently, his sons.  




 My idea of [glorious miles](http://www.iamtonyang.com/1208/concord_coach_bus_interior.jpg). Let someone else drive while [I kick](http://johnnyjet.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BobRavitzFloridaCarTrain20085.jpg) back, drink coffee ([or have a drink](http://images57.fotki.com/v1418/photos/2/211932/13400374/AMTRAKSPACIFICPARLOURCAR2-vi.jpg)), do emails, listen to music and watch movies. 

Got rid of my last car a few years ago and have saved around 6k a year ever since. Haven't regretted one moment.  









 This is not good.

 According to Ibach, the farm has been quarantined and the birds on the property will be killed. NDA will work with Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality to ensure proper disposal of dead birds. The likely method is burial at the site of the infection.
 
 In addition, facilities within about 6 miles will be quarantined and those within about 12 miles monitored. 





























 The National Weather Service says a 9-inch rainfall over a three-hour period may happen only once every 500 years; meteorologist Melissa Huffman said Clear Lake received 11 inches over three hours Tuesday evening.
