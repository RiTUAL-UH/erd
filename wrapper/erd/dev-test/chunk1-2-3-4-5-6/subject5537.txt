 I was just wondering what people thought about the idea of a bimbo sub dedicated to hardcore material? I absolutely love the pics that get posted here, but I'd love even more to see some gifs or videos of bimbos getting nailed or sucking cock, which is where half of the attraction comes from for me.

I realise the sub is NSFW by default, but that doesn't seem to extend to HC, and I think it's better that way - I always feel HC stuff should have its own sub.

Does anyone else think it's an idea that could work? Unfortunately I wouldn't be in a position to start it, I haven't been on this account for 30 days yet, and to be honest, I go back to work on Monday, so I'd be too busy to be a mod as well. If anyone did start one I'd definitely post on it and try to keep it going.

Anyway, just wanted to float the idea, and see what people thought :) 
























 I realise FC3 is quite an old game now, but I only recently bought and played it, and have to say, the cutscenes in it are absolutely brilliant, and I can think of few better.

The animations as they talk to you are brilliantly done, with all the subtle hand gestures, and body movements, and the voice acting is of a really high standard as well I think.

It's been a while since cutscenes genuinely got me more immersed in the game! It's also been a while since cutscenes genuinely made me laugh, but with Dr Earnhart, Hurk etc. I was chortling with gusto! 















































































 I recently just finished FC3 as a stealth player, but now I want to go back and become the embodiment of John Rambo. The thing is, I'm not sure how best to use C4 and mines in the game. In the experience I had in my stealth game, when enemies are fighting you, they often stay behind cover, and if they don't it's hard to predict where they'll go. Can anyone give me some tips on this? I'd be very grateful. 






































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 I've reached a point in the game where I'm finding dragon battles far too easy, and want to make them tougher. I know there is the mod Deadly Dragons, but I've tried and tried and can't get it to work. I also looked at Enhanced Mighty dragons but that seems to have been removed.

Are there any other active mods that could help me? Thanks 





















































































































































 I swear I've never played a game where I've put off completing as much as I have with Skyrim. I'm now at level 43, but just keep telling myself "I'll do this, then go back to the main quest.....I'll do THIS then go back to the main quest".

I still have the Dawnguard DLC to get through, and I'm thinking of getting Dragonborn, downloading the Fight the Thalmor stuff, and THEN I'll finish the main quest (I'm more or less at the end of that).

Honestly, no game has ever had this effect on me - desperately trying to extend the game because I don't want it to be over! :( (Then I start again with my stealth character :P) 


































 I was just wondering what you guys prefer your legs to be like? Do you prefer them thin, like those on a supermodel? Or do you prefer yours a bit thicker?

Personally, thin legs do nothing for me, I like mine with a bit more meat on them (up to a point!). I love to imagine them wrapped around my waist :D  




 For some reason, Belethor died in my game, probably at the hands of vampires. I realised this happened when his shop was closed for days on end. I used the console command to respawn him, and he went into his shop, but my problem hasn't been solved. Even during the day, it still makes me pick the lock to get in the shop and he just tells me to get out. Is there any way to cure this? Whiterun is my go to place to sell things and without Belethor there, it's a massive pain :( 
























 I absolutely love this game, and the quests are great, but I do wish they had more quests where not everything is handed to you on a plate, and you need to figure things out yourself from clues you're given.

One of my favourite quests was Lost to the Ages (from the Dawnguard DLC), where you receive a journal and have to use the map drawn in it with the notes to figure out where you have to go, and it's only when you arrive there that the marker appears. I feel that it just adds so much to the fun and immersion of the game. Also, I now have the Destruction Ritual Spell quest to do, and I'm busy trying to figure out where the clues lead with that book.

Are there other examples of quests like that in the game?

 




 I was wondering if there's a mod out there that adds numerical values to the stat bars on the hud? I'm playing as a mage, and would really like to know exactly how much magic I have so that I know exactly when I can cast a spell, rather than my usual "Fireba....oh no hang on. Right, fireb.....what??? still not enough?? OK NOW! FIREB.....oh I'm dead" 

It doesn't really help with the immersion :( Thanks for any help you can give 





























 Hi guys,

My favourite kind of picture or video when it comes to huge boobs is when a guy has his face mashed right into them, and I've seen enough material around to think that a subreddit on the subject could work, but was wondering if one like that exists already? I've tried searching but nothing has come up.

Thanks for any help! 




















































































 Definitely one of the best pictures I've seen on this sub. 
























 I'm afraid it's just a gif I found - no idea what the source is :( 













































































































 [Source](http://www.playvid.com/watch?v=44L7FogJoZp) 
































































 Big smile. Great rack. 



















 Yup! Just how I like them, nice and thick :D 




 Ok, thank you both :) 




 I was just wondering if it's possible to change the titles of posts in a sub that I mod?

Thanks 



















 Thank you :) 




 I'm really not sure mate but I do hope so! 









 I agree, not sure why a separate sub is needed for them, I'm sure they'd be welcome here! 




 Gifs are welcome at bimboxxx, but they must be of a hardcore nature, which is the purpose of the sub :) 




 Hi guys,

Over the last few weeks I've added quite a few shortcuts to my toolbar at the top of the table, and I was just wondering if there's an option to make the shortcut toolbar thicker, so that all my shortcuts fit on it, rather than having to scroll left and right to find them?

Thanks for any info 




 Ah ok, I'll post in there, thanks :)

The source code would be double dutch to me :D

Thanks for the help :) 




 Thanks mate, is there a manual or faq somewhere that I can find out how to do it from?? I've gone through all the preferences and can't find it! 




 As far as I'm concerned, Alia Janine is the best tit fucker out there, and so I wanted to share my favourite scene of hers with you all. I honestly had so much trouble deciding which section to make the gif from, but in the end I chose the part where her tits are all wet and slippery. I realise the gif is quite large, but I didn't want to cut it down anymore!

[Here](http://spankbang.com/1jrr/video/cumblastcity+mrs+janine+big+boobs+blasted) is the full, incredible video. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I do :D 









 Hi guys,

I'm currently using the RES, although I don't know if that has anything to do with my question! Basically, I've now gotten to the point where I'm subbed to quite a number of different places, and was wondering if I can make the grey shortcut bar at the top thicker, so that all the shortcuts are there on the same line, rather than having to click left and right to find them.

Thanks peeps 




 Cracking figure, and she's gorgeous as well! Nice post :) 




 "Hope is a good thing. maybe the best of good things. and no good thing ever dies." 




 Sorry it's just a gif I found on the net :( 















































































 What I love is that she has huge tits, but also a slim waist. Great proportions! 




















































































 The dress on its own would be amazing, but those thigh high socks elevate it to new levels!! Fantastic picture :) 




 Rosanna Davison I've been told. 



















 Fucking love it. I'd kill to have my face buried in those monsters! 



















 Yeah I love that girl's figure. 



































































































































































































































































































































































































































 Holy fuck, anyone know this woman's name? 




 /r/HighHeels  




 No bother at all :) 




 Found out on another sub, it's Cora Skinner :) 




 Dammit, I was trying to find some links to go with the names, but my internet is being shit, so I'll just give you the names.

Charlotte Poole

Nicola McLean

Gemma Hiles

Cara Brett

Chanelle Hayes

Sophie Reade


 




 To each his own I suppose, but as far as bimbos go I certainly don't rate her the hottest in the UK, and not even on the radar when it comes to the whole world! 




 Ah yeah, that was it, cheers :) I'll keep it here then, I'll let the mods decide whether or not to remove it :) 









 Ah, thank you so much. Was the picture in this sub do you know? Or is it ok to leave it here? 














 This picture is sure to get some love in /r/tightdresses :) 




 This picture was posted either on this sub or on /r/legs, I'm not sure which. The reason I'm posting it here (and there) is because someone ID'ed her last time, and I've forgotten her name and really want to get more pics of her! If anyone can link me to the re-post (I couldn't find it), then I'll take this down. If it's not a re-post, I'll keep it here.

 So would I! I'm afraid I don't know who she is, it was a random gif I found :( 




 I'm afraid I don't, it was a random gif I found :( 




 I'm afraid I don't know, it was a random gif I found :( 




 Stunning figure and gorgeous as well! 







































 Thank you :) 




 I'm about to play The Witcher 2 for the first time, and have the enhanced edition. I was under the impression that the Full Combat Rebalance mod was created by one of the developers, is that right?. Does that mean it was included in the enhanced edition, or do I still need to download and install it if I want to use it?

Thanks! 




 Lucy Pinder 




 Ah right, it makes more sense now. I wonder why they're less common in certain places. 
























 How can you tell? I'm rubbish at spotting photoshopped stuff :( 




 I absolutely love me a bit of Jordan Carver, but if this isn't a sweater, then I don't see how it's appropriate here. I'm not trying to be a dick, I know this sub doesn't get a lot of posts, but I do think we should stick to what the sub is about, otherwise what's the point of it? 



















 From my experiences of cycling, there does seem to be a nice camaraderie between those of us who travel that way, particularly in cities. Often, when I stop at the lights and another cyclist pulls up, I'll start chatting to them, making the whole journey that bit more pleasant. That doesn't seem to exist with those who drive, but I realise that's because you're both in a box on wheels, and winding down the window to shout across to the other driver does seem a bit crazy. They'd probably be terrified more than anything!

But anyway, yes, this guy was being an arsehole.

ETA: I know these guys aren't on bicycles, but I would imagine there's a similar unspoken bond. 




 I've never been one to comment on what I think is a poor post, I just downvote and move on, but I have to break my silence for this. The joke here appears to be that OP has found something shaped like a Capri Sun carton, but it actually contains soup, is that right? The only way I can see how that would be even remotely funny, nevermind get almost 2000 upvotes, is if these cartons were a novelty or a new item where the OP was from, is that the case? I've seen a few comments here which make me think it could be.

In the UK, at least, these pouches have been on the shelves for years for all sorts of things. [Dolmio](http://uk-pic2.ciao.com/uk/140079923.jpg), [Uncle Ben's](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTdQVkmw3Z3gtnGB_G45TRFKvUeu6zh-aKu80CraxZdRZzWjFsivg), [Maltesers](http://www.americansweets.co.uk/ekmps/shops/statesidecandy/images/british-maltesers-chocolates-case-of-11x-135g-bags-6135-p.jpg), [Soup that isn't Campbell's](http://www.britishsupermarketworldwide.com/acatalog/loyd_grossman_tomato_basil_pouch_soup_420g.jpg). They're so commonplace that it wouldn't even enter my mind that it's like a Capri Sun bag. 

Ah well, to each his own I suppose! I'm off to buy aforementioned products and reap sweet karma!
 




 I'd love it if someone recognised him and he was prosecuted. There's precedent for it apparently, according to one of the links in the comments.

 It reminds me of the picture that was on here recently of the guy planking a tiger in one of those sanctuaries. Harassing an animal for no other reason than an attempt to get a few laughs is pretty pathetic. 




 I'd say rock more than metal, but either way it's brilliant :D

It's not the full thing, but has the titfucking part in it. It's from a clip called Patients Without Borders on the Brazzers website. 




 To be fair to him, when an interviewer once asked him 'What would you be if you weren't a footballer?", he said "Probably a virgin" :D 




 Thanks mate :) 




 I have no idea! I just post things individually in different subs! 




 She's like Miranda Kerr with massive tits. Awesome gif. 


































 We're always looking for fresh posts on /r/bimboxxx, this would be perfect.

:) 



















 Definitely blue for me. 














 Ah! My apologies, I misunderstood. 




 Christ, how long are her legs?? And that mane of red hair is awesome :) 




 I'm genuinely curious as to what it is you find so bad about this picture. I realise you said the majority of the pics, which doesn't necessarily include this one, but that's the implication, seeing as you posted here.

She's wearing a tight dress, what else are you looking for? 




 How do you guys do this? I keep posting smaller pictures because I don't know how to make them high res like that. 




 Thank you :) 




 Ah thanks mate :-) I think I've always just called light blue turquoise so I'll be more careful in the future.  




 I think I need to get my eyes checked. I can see a light turquoise tinge in that dress but it appears I'm the only one! 




 I added a couple already :-) I've subbed to it, I love bandage dresses I'll post more pics when I see them :-) 

















































 Thanks mate :-) 




 I'll dig around for it when I get back from work.  
























 Can't believe I didn't recgonise her, she's one of my favourite bimbos! 




 Ah, sorry, didn't know the name so went by the heading on the picture which said Nichole Roedder for some reason.

Thanks for the correction.

 Wow! The girl on the left is incredible. Looks nice and tall, just how I like them :D

 Ok will do :-)

Edit: never mind its there already. 














 These comics are great. How long does it take you to do one? 




 Incredible cheekbones. 














 This is the incredible Aneta Buena. 









 This is Maggie Green. She is awesome. 





































































 I don't know and it's bugging the hell out of me!! I recognise the face but can't for the life of me remember her name :( :( 




 Love that figure. 




 I love these pictures of women who have really slim waists but still have a nice big ass! 





























 Is this Angie Varona? 









 In case anyone is wondering, her full name is [Leigh Darby](http://www.boobpedia.com/boobs/Leigh_Darby) and she's a British porn star.

 Why do models do this sometimes? i.e. have a bout a million different names they go by. 
































































 I don't mean speculation at the time when Ferguson was leaving and there was still a vacancy to be filled. I mean this utterly pointless speculation about what might be if Mourinho had become Man United manager. Like I said, there are a ton of 'what if's' you could come up with that would affect the league. It's absolute drivel, and it's made worse so when you consider his position on the site. Is this really the best that the BBC's top sports writer can come up with? 




 I don't, sorry :( 




 Yeah it's the speculative nature of the post I'm alluding to. This guy is the chief sports writer for the BBC and he just comes out with the most inane stuff. 

Speculation is for the tabloids as far as I'm concerned. You could literally speculate all day on football matters! What if Rooney had gone to Chelsea? What if Wenger had spent more money? etc. etc. It's such poor quality. 




 As far as I'm aware they went straight for Moyes on Ferguson's advice. But even if they had, the headline would have to read 'What if Mourinho had chosen Man United?'.

It's just so shoddy! 




 I would love nothing more than to say I took this picture myself, but sadly this is not the case.

I'm afraid I don't have a source, sorry :( 




 Yeah, it was the calves that got me!

No name I'm afraid, sorry :( 




 This guy has to be one of the biggest hacks around. When it comes to the Premier League I'm entirely neutral, but even I can see that he writes an inordinate amount of articles related to Man United, and this is his latest cutting-edge offering:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25758108

The chief sports writer, penning an article based on a 'what if?'. It's ludicrous. And to name the article 'What if Man Utd had chosen Mourinho?' is idiotic in itself - Mourinho was never offered the United job!

I wish they'd sack him and use the money they save to bring back 606!! 






















































 Very well - I had absolutely no idea! 




 Absolutely love that colour. 





























 Yeah I'll be honest, I didn't know whether or not I was stretching the definition of the term by posting it, but I decided to post it and let the mods decide her fate!  






















































 Haha I noticed that - is it a guy with one of those rage comic trololo faces?? 




 That's exactly where my frustration comes from. I try hard to post fresh content here, checking to make sure it's not in the top 50, or been posted in the last 15 days, and to come on and see that someone has actually taken the time to post such a nitpicking comment does my head in. I could understand if I'd posted a picture of a purple dress and said 'Green dress!', but red and orange are hardly a million miles away from each other. Surely people's enjoyment of these pictures aren't actually affected by any minor discrepancy between the title and what the picture actually shows? 









 I tried to find pictures that showed the heels more, but I couldn't :( This pic will have to do I'm afraid! 
























 [Fill your boots, good sir.](http://imgur.com/a/c6mJA) 




 Ah, really? :( 




 Indeed. Amy Childs isn't exactly what one would call a lady :D 



















 Eva Notty was my absolute favourite porn star until her most recent breast expansion. I think they just look awful now, whereas they used to look fantastic :( 




 Wow! Can anyone ID? 
























 That would be a bit *too* niche surely? :) 




 I am genuinely mystified as to why people post comments like this. So you came here to point out my mistake, saw that someone else had already done so, yet rather than just upvote them and move on, you upvoted (presumably) and then added this completely pointless comment. Are you really that desperate for everyone reading to know that you also spotted the mistake? That's the kind of thing I see in primary schools when a pupil blurts out 'I knew that!' when someone else gets the chance to answer, because they can't bear the thought of the teacher not acknowledging them for it. 




 No, my eyes don't need checking. The reason I thought it was orange is because my room is dimly lit in the evenings, and I also run a program called F.lux. Blue light is thought to upset the circadian rhythm, which is why using a computer before bed can have negative effects on sleep. F.lux is a program that blocks that some of the blue light that emanates from my computer screen, which gives it an orange hue.

Obviously I can now see it's red, but do you really think snide remarks about people needing to have their eyesight checked is going to encourage people to post here? I'd love to think you were genuinely concerned for me, but I seriously doubt that.

You'll notice that over 200 people upvoted the picture, and no doubt a lot of them saw my mistake, but the vast majority didn't feel the need to publicly point it out. 




 Henleymeat! 




 Is it? I searched her name before I posted and didn't see it. 




 I want to fall asleep IN them 




 Afraid not, sorry :( 




 Same here, I think she's fucking gorgeous. 




 I think this is Jodie Marsh 


















































































































 This picture is in the top 10 of /r/legs, for obvious reasons :) 



















 Haha this completely confused the shit out of me! I was sitting thinking 'eh?? I didn't post it here". I was thinking of it, but I didn't think it quite fit the criteria. Enjoy your ill-begotten karma!! :D 




 God, that area of a woman's body around the neck, collarbone and just above the breasts is so fucking hot on slim women. 




 Just wanted to return and say a huge thank you to /u/Rath1on for not letting me give up. I turned the difficulty down to Easy just to get through the dreadful prologue, and now I'm really having fun :) I do still find the combat a bit clunky and unresponsive, but on the other hand, it can be really exhilarating with the improved power of the signs etc.

Thanks! 




 I do exactly the same thing and for the exact same reasons. I love watching the NFL but I always find myself wondering how people watching it on TV put up with these constant adverts,  they drive me absolutely mad. It was the same when I watched Aussie rules football in Australia. Certain channels literally had an ad break every time the game was stopped for whatever reason. It was awful!
 




 That thumbnail makes them look like conjoined twins. 




 Thanks for the ID :) 





























 Before the rest of my comment, I would like to make it clear that I absolutely agree that banning a child for 4 days for bringing in a small packet of mini cheddars is absolute lunacy.

However, having now worked in schools for a number of years, I would like to comment on some of the points raised here. A lot of comments focus on the fact that foods shouldn't be taught as good or bad, and that things like crisps etc. should be ok, as long as they form part of a good overall diet which is true. But while it's clear that everyone on this thread is well educated in what a child's diet should look like, the reality is that a lot of parents are either uneducated, or simply don't care, judging from some of the packed lunches I've seen pupils bring in, packed with crisps, fizzy drinks, sweets etc. If the parents are unwilling or unable to become educated about healthy eating, then it falls to us to instill that in pupils. The lack of education on subjects such as this among some parents is one of the main reasons we need to do PSHE (Personal, Social and Health Education) lessons in schools. Everything contained in these lessons, including those about a balanced diet, are things that pupils should be taught by their parents but, for whatever reason, they aren't.

People might also say that it's none of the school's business what a parent wants to feed their child, but I personally disagree with this. Of all the schools I've worked in, only one has not had a healthy eating policy, which meant pupils could bring in whatever they want, and the behaviour in that school was definitely the worst I've ever encountered. I realise that in itself can't be considered evidence, as there are other factors involved, but there are plenty of studies to indicate that healthy eating does improve children's behaviour on the whole. Trying to get 30 16-year-olds settled and focused when they're up to their eyeballs in sugar and caffeine wastes a ridiculous amount of time, that could, and should, be spent teaching.

Like I said, I agree that the situation contained in the link is overkill of the highest order, but to the people who are outraged that the school is trying to dictate what the pupils eat - it's done for the right reasons, but implementation of it is often troublesome. 




 Hmm, I just checked and that happened on my mobile, but not with my PC. No idea what's going on, sorry :( 




 Actually yeah, this is my favourite one now. I love how he's got Tim Lovejoy's mannerisms down to a tee with his 'I may be older but I'm still one of the lads waheeeeeeeey' routine. 




 Pictures here are nsfw by default. 



















 Haha I loved the line about escape velocity. 












































 Yeah, quite apart from the dress showing off her great figure, she's absolutely gorgeous. 
























 Her name is Blondey McLeggyleg

Disclaimer: I may have made that up in order to allow the picture to stay. 
























 Christ on a fucking bike.

Thanks mate! 




 [Source](http://www.playvid.com/watch?v=jfdeYl5Try0) 









 What the fuck! Anyone know who this is?? 




 Not that I'm aware of :( 




 I've sent a message to the mods to ask if this picture is suitable for this sub. Obviously it's tight around the upper body, but not the lower half. Would be interested in the general consensus. 



















 One of my favourite models, her body is absolutely insane. 
























 I'm afraid I don't know but I think this looks like an advert for glasses or something so she might be a pro model.  




 I can't decide what impresses me more, your candour or your vigour! :-) 









 While I'm not colour blind, I'm notoriously bad at getting colours right in pictures. This being yet another example! 


































 Yeah I think I'll drop the difficulty for this awful prologue certainly, then perhaps put the difficulty to normal and see how I fare once I start getting some skills. 




 Do you parry absolutely everything if not doing attacks?

The reason I say the quen slows things down is that I can be fighting, then realise I need to quen, so have to physically stop moving, then cast the quen, and then keep fighting. The stop start nature of it seems so clunky to me, unlike the games I loved the combat in like Arkham Asylum or God Of War 














 Well, I've tried the FCR and I'm afraid you're going to be losing more sleep! It's certainly an improvement, but not enough for me to try playing the whole game. I know what the main thing is now that I don't like about it, and it's the problems with the parry/riposte system. In the vanilla game, your animations are too slow, and you can't cancel them so you get killed so easily by other guys unless you constantly roll all over the place, and in the FCR, it doesn't seem to have any kind of parry system that you control, it seems totally random. And then, having to stop every now and then to cast Quen just slows everything down again. I'm afraid I just find it far too unwieldy to be enjoyable, but thank you for the help :) 














 Yeah I'd be starting afresh anyway :) Thanks 




 What are the re-post rules on this sub, if any?

I only ask because a number of picture subs I'm part of have a no re-post rule for the top 50 or 100 pictures, and this picture is number 7 in the top 100 here. Just wondering what the case is here. 
























 I already tried FCR2, but couldn't really get to grips with it, but will go back and try it again. 




 This is why I asked whether or not the dodge spam is just in the prologue, or whether it carries on throughout the game. Part of the reason I'm struggling is definitely because I have so little in the way of traps, bombs etc. I just don't like the idea of, even with having lots of resources to hand, constantly having to roll all over the place. I'll reinstall FCR2 and give it another go :) 




 Definitely not misquoting. The number might be slightly off, but it was definitely about a picture of an erect penis versus a picture of a vagina. 




 Thank you, my liege! 

I go forth with a fire in my heart, and will strive to yet further the cause of this beautiful subreddit. FOR TIGHTDRESSES!!!

Seriously though, thank you very much :) 









 I can't remember exactly where I read this, but I think it was Men's Health. They had a little fact page and one of the facts was that, according to a survey they did, about 65% of men, when given a choice, would rather look at a picture of an erect penis than a vagina. To be honest, I'm also a heterosexual male, and I'd choose a picture of an erect penis every time. 


































 Thanks a lot for the detailed response. Unfortunately, I don't think the game is going to be for me by the sounds of it, which is such a shame, I absolutely loved the first one! 

But the 3rd one should be out in the not too distant future, so hopefully I'll be able to enjoy that one :) 














 I've just recently started playing the Witcher 2, and unfortunately I'm just not enjoying it at all due to the combat. I've read loads of things online about it, and the general consensus seems to be in order to be successful you use signs, attack, roll away, and repeat this over and over. Is that the case the whole way through the game?

Before people start having a go at me, I'm not saying the combat is bad, I'm just saying I personally don't find it enjoyable and won't do if dodge spam is a large part of what I need to do the entire game.

Would appreciate any replies.

Thanks!  









 Cold, and yet, so hot. 









 Christ, those legs! 




 Bang tidy! This is Rhian Sugden, by the by.

 I don't find it unbelievable that he's enlightened or completely accepting of his friend, and I'm glad that he is. What I find hard to believe is what you claim he actually said. As if his enlightenment is such that he wouldn't understand that the 'problem' his friend wanted to discuss was that he was coming out. It sounds like something from some cheesy teenage drama.

 Look, I'm really glad that your son doesn't see homosexuality as an issue, I genuinely am. But please, don't try and feed us the absolute absurdity that he's *so* enlightened and blase about it, that when his friend came out to him, he didn't even register that it was the 'problem' his friend wanted to talk about. Next time, maybe try something like:

My son's response was "Ok. Is this what you meant when you said you had a problem you wanted to talk about? Don't worry mate, we're best friends, I don't care about stuff like that."

Much more believable, and less likely to get people linking you to /r/thatHappened  




 I recommend Jedi 




 Issit? Thanks :) 




 The one in the middle is gorgeous, does anyone know who she is? 




 Perfect, thank you :) 


































 Can anyone make this bigger? 



















 Just goes to show how different people can be. I personally love it when you can see a bit of VPL, while g-strings do absolutely nothing for me whatsoever. 




 Jesus fucking christ, she's 15?? Right that's it in only posting pictures of pensioners now just to be on the safe side! Thanks mate 



















 I would motorboat those until my dying days, if only I was given the chance. 














 Ah shit, thanks for the heads up 




 Ah, ok! Perfect :) 




 Quite often I end up saving the picture to my desktop then uploading to imgur, would that still work? I would imagine it wouldn't because the actual link name would change. 




 What a body.
 









 Just goes to show how different people's tastes are - number 1 is definitely my favourite! 









 Ah cheers, I didn't realise there were programs designed to help the prevention of re-posting, I'll be getting my hands on them :) 



















 This woman apparently used to be a London escort, but her name escapes me unfortunately :( 




 WOW!!! One of the most beautiful women I've ever seen posted on this sub. Bit of a long shot, seeing as it looks like a random selfie, but does anyone have an ID for her?  




 girl in pink has incredible thighs 




 Her ass is huge! I love it :-D 


































 Never have I been so glad to live in London :P 




 Amazing tits as well. 




 How more black could this dress be?

And the answer is, none.......none more black. 




 Get thee to /r/bentatthewaist, for they will derive much enjoyment from this picture!

I love this one, thanks OP! 



















 Dayum-i Padron I think would be a more appropriate moniker! 









 She looks like one of those inflatable sex dolls in that last picture. 




 Love that ass! 




 Haha I put it there hours ago :-D 




 Fuckin...NICE! 




 Great figure! 




 I love fabric like that, where you can really feel the body underneath the dress, is that silk? 




 This may be a picture for the heels, but I cannot stop staring at that arse. 




 Sorry, I made that sound as if anyone who likes it is 'wrong', which wasn't my intention. What I mean is that I'm convinced that there are lots of people who'll go along with anything that sounds remotely profound such as some of the quotes that go with these pictures, just because they think they should, or because it makes them look really deep, not because they actually believe it or understand it. 






















































 [This is the complete picture](http://i.imgur.com/Y8JbgFv.jpg) 

:) 




 I'm with you, I really don't get the love for this kind of thing. Personally, I think there's an air of The Emperor's New Clothes about it all. No one wants to be the person to stand up and say 'Actually, I think this is ridiculous', for fear of the reaction they'd get. 




 It could just be the old cynic in me, but please tell me I'm not the only one who enjoys these pictures from a photographic viewpoint, but finds the quotes that follow just absolute pretentious nonsense. Is this what these people are actually meant to have said at the time? Or were they allowed to go away and think about something and send it in? I only ask because I have never met anyone who speaks even remotely like almost all of these people, and reading them makes me grateful that that's the case!

EDIT: Changed wording 




 I think you could be right! :) Even if you aren't, that woman's fucking gorgeous as well :D 




 I love how the dark lines compartmentalise her body parts perfectly :) 




 Yes I do post a lot and I'll continue to do so. All I'm doing is trying to contribute fresh content to the subs that I'm part of, I don't see how it matters who the posts are made by. But as I said, I will take more time in describing the pictures accurately, I can understand the frustrations it causes. 




 Perfect fit :) 




 Fuck she's beautiful, who is she? 




 Yeah they've gone a bit OTT with it, especially in the face :/ 




 Yeah this is Jasmine James, apparently. I didn't know but someone IDed for her me :) 




 Brilliant picture!  




 She's done a couple of videos with Leeanne Crow on ddf. She is so fucking sexy 




 Thanks :-) 




 Holy shit thanks for the ID and album link she's incredible!  




 Thank you good sir, you've just cleared up a massive amount of confusion for me and my friends! We were on our way to Kensington, and the District line was packed with people in costumes and we couldn't for the life of us figure out why! 




















































































 As do I! My pins would look dynamite in it! 




 I really wish you could edit titles here :( 




 Thank you for the consultation, kind internet stranger. While you're here, do you think you could have a look at my balls? I seem to have developed a rather nasty rash. I've sent you a picture as a PM. I await your diagnosis with a hopeful heart! 




 Agreed. I was too hasty in posting and only glanced at them. But thank you for not being a dick when correcting me, that happens very rarely on here. 




 Love that skirt - very sexy. 




 Wow! Thank you for that :) 




 I did not receive the luxury of such an education, raised as I was by wolves in a forest untouched by human hands and unseen by human eyes. 









 There's a picture from the same set on another sub, and her face looks awful in that one as well. She's got such a beautiful face, naturally, she doesn't need layers of make up! :( 









 Yeah she's very much like Denise Milani in that respect. 






















































 I absolutely love how dresses like this make women's arses look so fucking big and juicy! I want a bite! :D 




 Is there a video of this?  




 I gladly volunteer to test this theory out! 




 I love that she's doing more and more hardcore stuff now. 




 I'm getting a forbidden access screen. 









 As soon as I saw my mistake I was thinking 'Shiiiiiiiiiiit people are going to think she posts here now!!'.

My apologies :( 
































































 This picture seems to get posted in a constant cycle between here, /r/legs, and /r/highheels :)

This is not a complaint - it's a great picture :) 




 I wish I knew, she's absolutely stunning! 




 Hmmm, not sure why. Just checked it myself and it's working for me. 




 I mean /r/WendyFiore, sorry! 




 I mean /r/WendyFiore, sorry! 




 I mean /r/WendyFiore, sorry! 




 I mean /r/WendyFiore, sorry! 




 I mean /r/WendyFiore, sorry! 




 Does this count as a sweater? If not, please remove mods, but dammit I had to let people see this gif. 







































 Apologies for the dreadful picture quality :( 



















 I can't stop imagining her slowly unzipping that dress, unleashing the cannons that lay beneath! Mercy! 




 Thanks for the ID :) 




 Georgia Salpa I think 




 Source unknown sorry. Random pic! 




 /r/seethru would probably enjoy this, if you haven't posted it there already.  




 Insta-boner 




 I can't believe a film called Mr Grumpypants has a line like that in it! Disney are getting pretty heavy these days. 




 HEID! PANTS! NOW! 





























 This is a great picture of her rack, but I can't believe what her make up artist has done to her naturally pretty face!
 







































 But the stat says that 632 players played for Arsenal **before** Wenger, and that 188 players played under Wenger. So you have to add those numbers up before you work out the percentage, making it 22.9%, which is still a hell of a lot! :) 




 [The Daily Mirror](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsene-wenger-infographic-stats-17-3625829) version doesn't quite match up to the standard of the OP. 




 Isn't her name Faith Nelson?

http://www.boobpedia.com/boobs/Faith_Nelson 




 You're really confusing me now, so I'll try again from the top!

You asked why they would even try and fix a match, when the authorities were going to be scrutinising it. When you said 'they', I assumed you meant the Nigerian players.

In my reply I said they may still try and fix the match regardless, as these things often involve lots of money and they might feel it was worth the risk. In this particular case I did mean the Nigerian players, but I also mean generally. For example, the Pakistani cricket players who were caught match-fixing must have known the dangers of being caught, but went along with it anyway.

So, in summary, any players from any sport who get involved in match-fixing are likely to know that they're being watched or that the consequences of being caught would be dire, but the money to be made can be enough of a temptation to try it. 




 No matter how many times I see it, I'll never be convinced this was anything but deliberate. A few people have said that he must have been putting pressure on both sides of the ball when he caught it, and when his right hand "slipped", the force of his left hand pushed the ball into the net. But the ball was coming straight at him more or less when he caught it, so most of the force from his hands would be behind the ball. I just don't believe for a second there would be enough force to push the ball in at that speed when his right hand did move without him actually chucking it in. 

I showed this to a friend of mine who abhors football and he burst out laughing when he saw it! 




 I'm talking in general about any player who is involved in match fixing. 




 Please God, don't let this happen!! :( 




 I would imagine they're happy to fix a match, even under close scrutiny, because they could stand to make a massive amount of money from it, and as has been demonstrated perfectly, it's almost impossible to prove whether or not someone has done something deliberately, despite how obvious it looks to those watching. 




 I'm with you mate, I can't see how anyone would see this as anything other than blatantly intentional. Yes a player jumps into him, but the ball was coming straight at him at the time of him catching it. I just refuse to believe there was enough contact, or the keeper was exerting enough pressure on the ball from one side, to cause that to happen! He's lobbed it! 




 The match isn't being fixed for the benefit of the Nigerian team, it's being fixed for the benefit of all the people who are in on it, and stand to make lots of money from bets. 




 Out of interest, are landlords allowed to specify at all when it comes to tenants? I only ask because I'm looking for a place in a house share at the moment in London, and one of the sites called Move Flat often has adverts that state "for female". I don't know if there's a "for male" option, but I've never seen an advert with that on it, although I would imagine the option is there.  




 She looks like a well-endowed Chloe Moretz. 




 Love this bit about Messi :D

 With a favourable draw, an impressive squad supporting him, and without Diego Maradona being behaviourally barmy and tactically unhinged in the dugout, the stage is set for one of the greatest footballers of all time to retake the lead in his personal World Cup goalscoring head-to-head against Brighton's Matthew Upson, which currently stands tantalisingly poised at 1-1. 




 Is there the possibility of Rangers going to the wall again over all this? I genuinely find it hard to keep up with goings on, especially as I don't live in Scotland anymore. 




 Ray-zon det-ruh

I think! 




 Sammy Braddy. 




 If you could provide a source for this I'd be very grateful :) 




 What's a brew? 




 Yeah winning against control is satisfying, mainly because my decks tend to get ripped apart by them! 




 I was just wondering if there's any decks you play against that give you that bit more satisfaction winning against than other decks.

I have a Sanguine Bond + Crypt Incursion deck which I've used to pretty good effect, but the deck I love to beat more than others with it is the U/B mill deck. I just played someone who was playing Jace, as well as Phenax, and in two turns he managed to mill me to about 12 cards left, and the whole time I was just sitting grinning as he fed my win condition. (I play online, so I don't need to play with a poker face!)

Casting the crypt incursion right at the death was highly satisfying :D

What are yours? 




 Hahahah! That gave me a proper belly laugh, wasn't expecting that at all :D 




 Yeah I've had bodies disappear and was always worried the rats had munched them, but it seems to just happen sometimes and doesn't register as a death, 




 Especially not when you're bouta go on! 




 Fucking hell - the very thought of being ridden cowgirl by Leanne Crow is instantly boner inducing, never mind a picture that shows you just what the view would be like!! 




 Wahey! Got it :) Thanks for the tips, it was definitely the drowning that did it before, I always made sure of the other ones you guys talked about. 




 Exactly! I've been doing that every mission, but didn't know about the drowning :( 




 When I do it this time, everyone is getting thrown on top of a fucking cupboard :D 




 I'm pretty sure that must have been what caused mine. I'll try again and make sure I keep them out the puddles this time! 




 They can drown??? Fucking hell. So if I sleep dart someone I need to make sure they aren't left in a big puddle of water? 




 I know there's been a recent thread about someone who took hours to complete a mission, only to have "hostiles killed:1" at the end, and I'm having a similar problem in The Surge level of the Knife of Dunwall DLC.

My question is - what kind of things can cause hostiles to be killed after you've knocked them out?

I know rats can eat them, so I always stash bodies off the floor.
I also know that falling from a height can kill them, so I always try to do a choke and carry.

What other ways can it happen? I got yet another single hostile killed in that level, even though I made sure no-one fell, and the bodies were out of the reach of rats (which I killed as well just to be sure!). 




 Thanks everyone. I didn't realise Chrome had such trouble with Silverlight. I've downloaded it again and I'm using it on IE and it's working fine :) 




 Chrome - do I need IE for HTML 5? 




 Hi everyone,

I've been having massive problems with Silverlight recently, getting that 2103 error code and not being able to fix it no matter what steps I take.  I noticed in the playback settings there's a choice for HTML5 over Silverlight, which I've ticked, but when I try to watch something it tells me I need to download Silverlight first!

Is HTML5 playback only available on Windows 8, or am I missing something somewhere?

Would really appreciate any help, it's very frustrating :( 




 Has anyone been to the temple of Abu Simbel? I'm dying to go, but feel like I should temper my expectations a little. It's only recently I've discovered they moved it, so it's not in the mountainside anymore like Petra is. Would appreciate any thoughts on it :) 




 100% agree. I couldn't beleive how small the Sphinx was, I was so disappointed :(

And I think the biggest disappointment about the pyramids is how close they are to the city. All the postcards etc. make it look like they're in the middle of the desert, but you can literally see them from a Pizza Hut not far away!

It has taught me one thing - do more research in future! 




 I think one of the biggest obstacles Liverpool could face next year is that Man City would have to be dreadfully unlucky to have Toure, Kompany, Aguero and Silva all injured for the same amount of time they did this year. Wasn't there some stat that they'd only played 216 minutes together? If City can keep them fit next year, and they'll more than likely add a couple more players, things will be very tough for Liverpool, especially with them in Europe again, which requires the squad to be used to its fullest. They'll still be challenging though, regardless. 




 That was started by Chelsea fans I think, and has been adopted since by anyone playing Liverpool! 




 It certainly would - Carroll plays for West Ham! 




 [This](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/27048713) page from the BBC site is interesting. In the last decade, John Higgins is the only player to have won the championship (twice, in fact) having been involved in more frames than his opponent during the tournament. 




 I want Ronnie to win because, like you, I want him to finish his career as the undisputed best of all time - most world titles, most centuries etc.

I think if he was to play Selby his chances would be much higher. I agree that Robertson seems to have that toughness, and wouldn't be intimidated by his opponent or the occasion. 




 Thanks everyone, I managed comfortably in the end, the use of Halftracks was definitely my saviour :D

Unfortunately, I now find myself on the utterly horrendous Mortain counterattack and I don't know if I can be bothered with this style of level!  




 I do use my own tanks and AT guns, but this map is so wide, I find it hard to stop them finding a hole in my defences somewhere and getting behind me :( 




 Holy cow, I didn't know that! Thanks, that's going to make things much easier :) Although what I struggle with now is tanks rampaging through my lines, but I never use tank traps, so I need to start building them I think. 




 Thanks a lot for the reply :)

I do advance and build hard cover, but I was finding even that wasn't sufficient, but I've started to be more patient in my attacks, and sending back one unit at a time to reinforce while my other troops stay there and it seems to be working better. :) 




 Hi guys, I just started playing CoH a week or so ago, and I'm on the Hill 92 level and really struggling. The problem I'm having is that I send my troops etc. to attack, but each of my units loses a couple of guys or more, and I don't have the forward bases to replenish them, and I get overrun. Is there a tactic I should be employing that I don't know of? The only forward bases I can think of in this level are the ones on the left and right of the map. Is that what I should be using? 




 http://i.imgur.com/stFJnm0.gif 




 I love comics like this, where the women are bigger than the men (or boys in this case!) and take control, thanks for the post! 




 Oh my God, my stomach is in so much pain from laughing at this, and it's for the exact same reason as the one with the cat fail - the way the legs just splay out helplessly absolutely cracks me up every single time. XD XD

EDIT: And I think it's also the fact that neither of them even come close to making it. XD 




 [Craig Gordon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjXIsAACBuE) made a similar save a few seasons ago. 




 It's from her own website.

[This page](http://www.leannecrow.com/boobs/2803/Big-Boobs-On-Glass-GoPro-2.html?nats=) has a preview of it. Not sure if the section from the gif is in the preview though. 




 Love this! I haven't had the chance to get to Highgate West yet, but this is the piece I'm looking forward to the most when I do get there :) 




 I have been playing this game for a few days now, and I could not for the life of me get past 128. I follow this, and I get to 256 in seconds. Unbelievable.

Thank you both :) 




 Ah ok, thank you for the swift reply. Is it a 7 minute silence at the games, or something else? 




 I just checked the BBC Sport website for kick off times this weekend, and noticed these rather unusual times. I realise that a difference of 3pm and 3.07pm isn't huge, but I was just wondering if there's something on this weekend that has completely passed me by and is affecting kick off times. 









 Fear not Red_Vancha, there are those of us who took the post in the manner it was intended and got a chuckle out of it :-) unfortunately, dry humour doesn't always seem to translate well when it's just written :-( 




 Can anyone upload a gif of Lukaku and Martinez celebrating? Sounds like something worth seeing :D 




 I don't think this is fake. This is Maritza Mendez from the sexmex website, and she does have insane proportions.

[This ](http://www.primecurves.com/maritza-mendez-land-lady/)is the prime curves site with other pics from the set.

And [this ](http://www.sexmex.xxx/preview/models/maritza.html#girls)is her page from the sexmex site. 




 Sophie Reade 




 [This](http://i.minus.com/iXATejJ4TvHp.gif) is a zoomed-in version.

Also NSFL, obviously. 




 Allow me to furnish you with a pointless fact. I recently discovered that Stewart Lee lives in the same street as me. As you were. 




 This is the single biggest reason I've never seen The Hobbit films, and don't intend to. The Hobbit films are far too heavily based on (often not very good) CGI for my liking, while the orcs etc. in LOTR looked incredible. 




 Thanks guys, and thanks for the wikipedia snippet, it was the outside interference part I was wondering about the most. 




 Incredible clip, I've never seen that before! (We only get NFL coverage in the UK, not college).

Out of interest, what would have happened if the last guy had been obstructed by a band member too slow to get off the field and then been tackled? Other than the band member being beaten to a pulp by the team of course! 




 Your second point is the reason these titles rile me so much. Don't try and sway my opinion before I've even read something with some manipulative crap. I'll form my own opinion as to whether or not I'm 'blown away' etc., which, nine times out of ten, I'm not!

 




 An artist wanted to take photographs of a small US town. How he did it will leave you speechless... 




 A man decided to make some model cars. What he did next will blow you away... 




 Perhaps, but it was more the length I was referring to. I thought the original was too short, and this one fixed that. 




 Perfect! Thanks mate, this should get upvoted to be top comment, it's better than the OP! 




 Ah, I was looking at the 'as it stands' table on the BBC site, and you're right, after this game we still have a game in hand over them. 

Disappointing would be an understatement I think if we didn't manage it :( 




 Thanks guys :) 




 I didn't realise before this game that we had a game in hand over Tottenham! Brilliant! 

Is 6th place enough for Europa league as things stand, or is that dependent on Man City winning the league? 




 Thanks for these mate.

Is Mignolet slightly at fault for the first goal? (as well as the defence obviously) I can't believe he's left such a big gap to his right.

Liverpool's goal was a cracker, gorgeous pass to Johnson. 




 Apologies if it's been posted already, but it reminds me of [this lovely video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apsz1lVyXSY). 




 That housewife one is fucking brilliant, thanks for that. 




 Her name is Stacey Poole, not Lucy :) 




 Thanks mate :) 




 Hi everyone, Tomb Raider is on sale in Steam at the moment and I'm definitely going to snap it up, but was wondering what the different versions include (well just surviuval and GOTY because vanilla is obvious!).

The reason I ask is because I bought Dead Space 2 GOTY and wish I hadn't because I hate the way that some of the DLC gives you better equipment earlier than you would normally get it, and I want to avoid that if I can with TR.

Does survival just add extra multiplayer maps, or does it include some equipment as well?

Would be very grateful for any info! 




 Christ, those things are natural. 




 The dinner of champions. 



















 It was decent of Steve Bruce to stick up for Pardew, but his comment of "It's not like Alan, he's an established Premier League manager" seems a bit odd. Didn't Pardew push an assistant ref earlier in the season? 




 I love how Merson reacts like a kid opening a christmas present! He's loving it! :D 









 Who is that on the right? 









 Stupendous body! 




 Personally speaking, I actually prefer these types of pictures to the ones where the girl in question is flashing her bits to all and sundry. 




 I would be of absolutely no use I'm afraid. I'm a guy - I just post pictures I find elsewhere on the net! 
























 I love pictures like this. I always imagine myself lying on top and burying my face in them!! Great fun. 




 I really want to be excited for this film, but after seeing this trailer I just can't be. I think it looks like it's just going to be yet another in a long line of bad-average movies that lean far too heavily on the CGI aspect, at the expense of everything else (King Kong, Transformers, Avatar etc.). I really hope they prove me wrong! But the cgi at 0.45, and 1.09 just makes me cringe :( 









 Holy fucking shit, those legs, and that ass!!!! 




 I swear someone in the English FA has incriminating pictures of Michel Platini somewhere. Can't believe their luck, again! Meanwhile we're stuck with one of the teams favourite to win the World Cup! Again!

Ah well, at least we'll have some fun away days :D 




 Alexa Attias I think 




 Yes they do, but they expect us to use it responsibly and constructively, as I imagine most places do. Sadly, sitting looking at pictures of women doesn't really count as either. 




 Love it! Dresses that are off one shoulder drive me crazy! Such a sexy look. 




 This woman's thighs are absolutely incredible! 




 I don't know where you work, but if I was caught looking at pictures of women on the internet in my workplace, whether they were clothed or not, I'd be in a disciplinary meeting before you could say 'phwoooooooar'.

This sub is NSFW by default :) 




 Apologies for the poor quality 









 Apologies for the poor quality. 









 Apologies for the poor quality. 





























 Cora Skinner 




 I was sat there staring at the screen for ages thinking I was going made because I couldn't see a CS anywhere! This clears up the mystery, thanks! 




 I had the ending similarly ruined, but by that utterly unfunny cow Daisy Donovan. I'm glad she's disappeared into the ether. 




 Thanks for the sub! :) 




 Do you just use words in your search, or is there a program similar to karmadecay that looks for similar images? 




 Olesya Malinskaya 




 We do indeed :) 




 One of my favourite ever replies on Reddit :) 




 This is one of the top pics in /r/legs, for obvious reasons :D 




 How do you do that without affecting the resolution? 




 Thanks :) 




 I went to Uni in Hull, stayed on Auckland Ave :) Great memories! 



















 Hi guys, I checked this with the mods first and they're ok with me posting this. I've noticed a couple of hardcore pics of bimbos here recently, and just wanted to make everyone aware that myself and /u/timetopull set up a sub for that very reason called /r/bimboxxx 

To be honest, I feel like I'm ploughing a bit of a lone furrow there at the moment, so it would be great to see people over there and posting some stuff :)

Cheers! 




 Just saying a picture is photoshopped and leaving it at that isn't very helpful. I'll gladly take this down if you can provide an unedited version, or if you can point out the telltale signs. 



















 /r/bimboxxx

 Is anyone else's PC telling them that these posts were made 18 hours ago??? 




 I don't think so unfortunately. She's one of these girls who posts loads of instagram type pics, but never do the nips see the light of day :( 




 http://i.imgur.com/oXtNbN5.jpg 




 Thanks! Would you be keen for me to find more pictures of this ilk? It seems to me this sub definitely favours the slimmer woman wearing the tight dresses, but I love tight dresses on curvier women as well :) 




 I can only imagine the number and content of the PMs you must receive. Although I'm a guy, I sometimes post pictures with the word 'selfie' in them, and on more than one occasion I've had guys think it was me in the picture and send me a plea to show them more of my heavenly body. I have to admit, I've been tempted to send them a quick snap of my dazzlingly pale, non-female form, just to see their reaction, but I've resisted so far! 



















 One for those of use who enjoy the more voluptuous figure :) 







































 I realise I'm going against the grain here by saying this, but this is such a shitty thing to do someone if it's genuine and I can't believe it's getting upvoted. 




 Yeah, if this is what trannies look like, sign me up!  




 Fucking hell, I've never seen that before, and it is genuinely one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Laughed for a solid ten minutes there, thank you!! XD XD XD 




 Similar face, but there's no way that's actually her. I have no idea who it is though, sadly :( 




 Early shot of Miriam Gonzalez 
























 Not sure if this counts! If not, please remove, mods :) 














 Fucking incredible body. 




 Wish I knew :( 




 Quite. Imagine those wrapped around you! 




 WOW!!! Anyone got an ID? She's fucking stunning. 




 :) Thanks for taking this in the manner it was intended! I was a bit concerned I'd crossed the line! 














   i cut the upper part to not show her face etc, i guess you'll understand why

Is she massively ugly?

Only kidding, mate!!! Absolutely amazing pins :) 














 I'm not great with bra sizes, but I'm fairly certain they're fucking enormous. :) 




 Thanks for the video, mate. When I watched the gif it made me wonder why she made that shot in the first place. I couldn't understand how she'd managed to judge the flight of the ball so badly that she had to hit the ball behind her own back! But that clip clears it all up :) (For anyone who can't see the clip for whatever reason, the ball hits the net on the way through, significantly changing the trajectory of the ball) 




 I don't remember the quote exactly that's my favourite, but it's when Kelly and Bud are both going to bed.

Al: Kids, have I ever told you how much I love you?

Both: No Daddy.

Al:....why don't you go think about that. 









 I have such a weakness for redheads. Especially ones with faces and bodies like this!! Awesome post OP, thanks! 




 You could just say you were living up to your username ;) 




 This is one of these things I'd need to get done to me to believe it actually works (please note, this is not me saying it doesn't work). Surely to goodness you'd recognise that the person you were talking to literally seconds before has completely changed? 

One of the things that makes me think this particular clip is staged is because when the girl bends down and gets the phone, she starts turning her head while the other guy is still there. Surely she'd see him in her peripheral vision from there?
