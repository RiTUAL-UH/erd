 Actually, scratch that last comment, she drank potion and didn't die, so there must be some kind of power in her.

Unless, of course, she was expecting to be poisoned and drank some antivenom from her many, many tiny jars with love dust and whatnot...

Hmmm  




 I know, also, why does she need potions to conjure magic and trap men? *cough, cough* Stanis *cough, cough* 




 I don't think she will, she was very surprised when that happened and was like: I don't know how to do that *sob, sob* 




 Always wanted a pet rat but decided to get married.

Worked out though I got a mother in law *lol* 




 Actually I just realized that, also, the fact that she has failed to fulfill prophecies.

I don't think she has the power to resurrect Jon Snow so him coming back as a white walker is quite possible.

Damn it George, get your shit together man! 




 True that, true that 




 What about the death of Joffrey Cuntface and Rob Stark?

Or was that just a strange coincidence? 




 I actually don't like her much 




 The drug dealer neighbor that throws badass parties with donkeys, cheap booze and a lot of Brown nipples 









 Hey guys,  I don't really know how this works yet, so forgive me if I screw up.

Been a quiet observer for a while but now decided to join reddit, and now am totally confused.

So yeah...  
























 Was thinking the exact same thing 




 Actually that would be pretty cool, I would buy the shit out of that 




 It sure is summer 




 CoD in a nutshell 




 That's groovy 




 What if is not dead and just waiting for the right moment that someone gets close enough out of curiosity to take a bite out of its face.

Just sayin  




 The power of Christ compels you 




 Lemme see that booty 




 What does GoT have to do with this?

 Maybe, time will tell 
























 This, probably just a gift that got damaged.

Could've been a stone saying "I love my wife" or something I dunno 




 Nope

 









 I would think so

Plastic + dirt is never a good combo 




 Actually a friend of mine put some in his car and boy is it dirty (his is black though and I live in a dusty little town)

I'm not sayin the vinyl looks bad but the design is... Well... I wouldn't drive that personally 




 I would imagine the upkeep must be a pain, imagine washing this and then a part of it comes off and you're like 

Seriously?!  




 Why does coal need testing? 

 




 I don't know if that looks awesome or if they just screwed up that car...

*scratches head 




 Oh hell yes, hold my beer

*Jumps in*

The foam! It does nothing! 




 Robodog

Quite cute and inspiring  




 I'm feeling as if I would loan 10 bucks to these stairs and they would not pay me back.

Also, this is too trippy 
























 http://youtu.be/YfczJAB-lKk here's the video, [SPOILER ALERT] 




 I kind of remember this happening in the first movie in the after credits, I would go more in dept but I don't want to spoil the movie 




 Its after the credits i think, can't remember though 




 I did not scare her, I did not

Oh hi Mark! 




 Nope, first [REC] and an enjoyable movie actually, quarantine was awful 




 "Oh shitfuck i shouldn't have listened to my dad" 




 So, RoS fixes the flaws of Diablo 3? I got D3 a while ago and played it for a bit BUT deleted it in a rage because of all the flaws it had (been a HUGE Diablo fan from the first game)

Does RoS let you play offline? 

(oh sweet baby Jesus let the answer be yes) 




 Lol, are you mental? 




 I can hear the angels singing

[heavy breathing intensifies] 




 I would try this if I weren't a dumbass who would surely die electrocuted 




 Somebody should add the deal with it glasses to this 
























 The scissor scene at the end is what got me 




 Das the stuff maine, das de stuff 




 I think its totally legit dood 




 I might sound stupid, but Le Interieur (probable typo there) really got me, I wasn't scared but I had this gut wrenching feeling after I watched it.

Also A Serbian film, sweet baby Jesus was that creepy 




 Oh yes, that scene haunted me for quite a time, after watching it I had the most unsettling drive back to my apartment. 




 Nailed it, Dany is quite unlikable because she gets what she wants because of Dragons and hot male fighters who are willing to do anything for her.

 




 lol, sorry im not a movie critic 




 I didn't like it at all! It wasnt a good remake IMHO and it was dumb, quarantin 2 was even worse.

Then again everyone is entitled to like different things  




 Ahhh, I was confused then since the two movies happen in the same exact building 




 Arent you supposed to be studying Sam?  




 Wat 
























 I wasn't planning on sleeping anyways 




 Wat 




 Haven't watched this, is it any good? Part 2 any good? 




 Companies make shitty tools so you'll end up buying replacements sooner than later to spend more money  
  
I'm looking at you truper, you piece of crap 




 Elephant trunk I think, could be wrong 




 It spoiled a remake that could've been good 




 Yeah, like I said, I got mixed up because the two movies happen in the same building  




 Ah yes, frontiers  




 There's this other French movie (not martyrs) about a group of people that get kidnapped by psychos, or is it martyrs? Can't remember but those movies are also gut wrenching.

I spit on your grave remake also gives me an uneasy feeling. 




 Awww 




 I'll never let go Jack "omnomnomnomnom"

You gotta let go Rose "omnomnonomnomnom"
