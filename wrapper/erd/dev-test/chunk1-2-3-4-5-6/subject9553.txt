 Say what you want to about India, believe me it's not perfect, but at least India is a real country, not a military occupation, engineered humanitarian disaster, apartheid and ethnic cleansing like Israel . Say what you want to about India, even though that really isn't what this is about, at least we oppress our own, instead of the Israeli way which consists of but is not limited to: traveling thousands of miles, displacing native Palestinian people, stealing their land, oppressing the descendents of the Palestinians on their fathers land reducing them to 2nd class citizens, create a state religion, call it all manifest destiny in the 20th century and send the bill to the US taxpayer. 




 Indian here and proud r/india representative, so there goes your theory, and whatever white guilt you were hoping to invoke in the readers of r/conspiracy. I posted this and I am not white,  deal with it JIDF shill there goes your last line of defense. I don't care if you call me racist cause its bullshit and I have ZERO white guilt so if you're going to call someone racist start with me, your brown, OP. The Israel hustle is well known globally, the religion and culture that I'm descended from is openly hostile towards Islam (North India near border with Pakistan) and even people there who HATE Muslims sympathize with the plight of the Palestinian people because India itself was under occupation until 1947. So its not just White Pride people or whatever you racially polarizing term you landed on, maybe next time try a different angle like oh, I don't know "All Brown people are Anti Semites!", or something I dont know this is your job after all, be creative !  




 What part of the words "Western Media Blackout" do you not understand ? PressTV was literally the only site publishing anything positive about Waters or the boycott in general. The other news agencies were all Israeli and you can guess what they reported about the boycott or Waters:
"HOLOCAUST ! HOLOCAUST! HOLOCAUST ! ANTI SEMITE ! ANTI SEMITE ! ANTI SEMITE !" 
So you'll forgive me for not getting my news from a Zionist approved media establishment, besides I never post anything from Press TV, look through my submissions, this is the 2nd time I've posted a PressTV article in 6 months. 




 I think the vast majority of OBJECTIVE readers will come to the conclusion that his dislike of Zionism is inherent and implicit in his general boycott of Israel.   




 The 1st thing I thought when I read this was:

 The American press exists for one purpose only, and that is to convince Americans that they are living in the greatest and most envied country in the history of the world.

Solar panels should have been on the White House for 36 years, beginning in 1977 with Jimmy Carter, before they were cruelly yanked down by the Reagan administration in 1981, because and I'm absolutely serious here, Reagan that they were the embodiment of "big government". Backwardness thy name be Reagan. The solar panels were not costly or wasteful, they just symbolized change and terrified Big Oil, which had a stranglehold over the presidency, since Kennedy's coup d'etat in '63.

 The worst part about this is that Senator Feinstein's amendment would mean that her ilk would be the ones deciding which journalists are real journalists, because everyone on r/conspiracy knows who owns the media and they happen to have a lot in common with Diane Feinstein. If Feinstein's amendment is adopted only people like the Bloombergs (Bloomberg), the Newhouses (New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Reddit), the Redstones, the Ochs (New York Times), and the Wenners (Rolling Stone). Basically Feinstein is saying that if you're not Zionist approved you're no longer a journalist, and that is basically the death knell of journalism as we know it. No factor has diluted the quality of journalism or the media as much Zionist consolidation.

 The Jewish people depicted in that photograph were not slaves, they simply weren't, they were interned in Nazi Germany, but they were not slaves, for a people to truly be enslaved it has to span across generations. The Jewish internment in Nazi Germany lasted 6 years, further more when looking for a depiction of slavery why look to Nazi Germany ? Why not depict African slavery in America, it is by far the most reprehensible case of slavery, yet OP chose to depict Jews in Nazi Germany where they weren't slaves. I think it's obvious that OP has an agenda he is trying to further, and it's one that attempts to gain Jewish sympathy to justify the Zionist agenda, what either reason is there for such a glaring oversight ?  




 And ... I just deleted Red Ice Radio from my podcast subscriptions.  




 The phrase that I took away from watching this video was "New Media Class", to describe the talking head phenomena on cable news, with their multi million dollar salaries serving as a poor substitute for the classic muck raking journalism of decades ago. Often those multi million dollar salaries are paid for by parent companies of media conglomerates such as GE to NBC. In other words Brian Williams endorsement to invade Iraq on the Nightly News isn't worth nearly as much if everyone in America is aware that Brian Williams boss at GE is profiting directly from the invasion/occupation.  




 It's practically a tragedy that, Jewish people who are not a minority, they're white people with big noses, play the race card more than any other group of people. If they're such an oppressed minority, then why do Jewish people own practically every large media corporation in America, a Jewish person, Samuel Newhouse, owns Reddit's parent company, Advanced Publication. For Jewish people to be an oppressed minority in America there would be some oppression, instead I don't even think there are any poor Jewish people in America, not 1. To be an oppressed minority in America you're usually subjected to some sort of societal or culturally inflicted economic despair, Jewish people on the other hand are the wealthiest group of people in America by far. Just take a look at the list of bank executives, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Hollywood studio executives and members of Congress that are Jewish and mostly Ashkenazi Jews to be more specific. Jewish people have hijacked and cheapen the Race card by being wealthy and white and still constantly complaining about racism so in actual instances of racism against real minorities they find that the race card is weaker in their actual instance of racism, because of it's constant abuse by over privileged, litigious Jewish people and the Anti-Defamation League.

 Ashkenazi Jews, even the 2 people that are being considered for the next Federal Reserve Chair, Larry Summers   Janet Yellen are both Ashkenazi Jews.

 This is by far the most infuriating thing that I've read on this sub in quite a while, now the elite own the sun, what next do they own the moon as well ? How could they possibly justify this ? I once applauded Spain for spearheading the renewable energy development charge, but now I know that it was only so the sun could be turned over to the elite in Spain first, to set legal precedent there 1st for the rest of the world. I can already see a 6-3 or 7-2 Supreme Court ruling in favor of privatizing the sun for the likes of Exxon and Chevron.

 I'm sorry about that, I'm just sensitive because someone just shamed me for spelling Michael Hastings name wrong in a meme that was meant to be a tribute to his intrepid journalism.

 Umm, it's called reading:

"GOGLAND ISLAND, Russia, July 15 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday he saw signs that Edward Snowden, the former U.S. spy agency contractor turned fugitive leaker, was shifting towards stopping "political activity" directed against the United States."

In your defense it was at the very beginning of the article, which I guess means that you did ZERO reading, but o well, that's Reddit for you, the loudest critic is also usually the slowest reader.

 I live in the Managerial Age, in a world of "Admin." The greatest evil is not now done in those sordid "dens of crime" that Dickens loved to paint. It is not done even in concentration camps and labour camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried, and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voices. Hence, naturally enough, my symbol for Hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the office of a thoroughly nasty business concern."

 The 1st thing I thought of when I read this article was :

"Goodbye local investigative news!"

Just like how mainstream media is drivel; the local news will soon be completely overrun with talking points for the talking heads on cable news. Just another domino in the downfall of the dissemination of information from the corporate media establishment which grows more conglomerated by the year. 

Sam Zell, the owner of Tribune Co., is adding to his collection of media entities quietly, engaging in this purchase just before a long 4th of July weekend, in other words this 10 figure transaction will be old news by Monday. Zell, is worth $4 billion, and is a shady real estate dealer who has worked to eliminate rent control laws to jack up rates in Florida for over a decade, and he has been one of the most outspoken CEO's in the wake of the burst of the mortgage bubble; saying that :

"This country [real estate market] needs a cleansing. We need to clean out all those people who never should have bought homes in the first place."
[20] He was referencing the many consumers who purchased homes at prices well above their means, as well as the mortgage lenders who encouraged those loans.

So because this story won't be news, and it's pretty much blatantly obvious why this story won't be news (i.e because it's about who controls the news) those were the important bulletpoints.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Zell 




 I posted this yesterday, while he was still missing granted, and my post got buried with little to no attention, and now they've announced they've found his body and r/conspiracy is all up in arms now that CNN of all people is announcing he's officially dead. I'm aware that correlation isn't always causation, but I mean come on r/conspiracy, where's your inner sleuthiness ? Correlation isn't always causation but in this case it seems pretty obvious, and not even in hindsight, I mean dead on arrival. And it's not even up the upvotes, it's that I thought I dropped a bombshell about him just missing in the woods amid this whole NSA scandal and his Senator/brother's role in the ensuing political theater. I guess what I'm saying is that, if they'd never found his body would this whole thing have just been swept under the rug by the media?  




 Now I've never claimed to be a great legal mind, but I do know this, South Africa's Muslim Lawyers Association probably hasn't encountered a monster like Obama's Jewish Lawyers Association.

 "Assassination is an extreme form of censorship."
 - George Bernard Shaw 

 




 Michael Hastings and Glenn Greenwald certainly both have/did have an abundance of enemies with military training and the means to coordinate an assassination. To me this is blatant intimidation of investigative journalists around the nation, the nature with which the New York Times barely mentioned his death, has all the airs of "an inconvenient situation being swept under the rug" by TPTB.  




 The coroners are saying that it could take up to 6 weeks to determine an official cause of death, what we have to do in the meantime is keep this story as fresh and robust as possible in people's memories; so when the near certain bullshit cause of death is revealed, at least a decent amount of people's bullshit radar will be going off. 

To say that Michael Hastings was a danger to the military establishment is a gross understatement, the amount of enemies he made by triggering the General McChrystal resignation are innumerable. So many military careers and potential promotions were derailed when the chain of command was upended by Hastings. 

I think at best this was a sloppy, public hit on a journalist by TPTB, who had already made his share of powerful enemies and was quite possibly about to uncover yet another scandal in Washington. At worst this was a clear message to investigative journalists around the country to start toeing the company line.

 For the trolls like AnSq, on this thread, it's not the government it's self that is paying these contractors, it's special interests groups like Crossroads GPS, the NRA, or a slew of other conservative interests groups that are simply vastly underrepresented on the Internet on social media sites, which are also a popular venue for political discourse. Dick Cheney isn't sitting around wondering why his hunting photos aren't getting more likes on FaceBook, that's Karl Rove and his army of suits and PR agent's job. BTW, this happens all the time, to anyone who can't guess this post was mainly in response to the naked shilling that has taken place on this sub, and the rest of the Internet courtesy of Monsanto and their army of subcontractors. If I had to present a solution to the problem, I'd probably have to go with the very unpopular among new users, 30 day old account requirement to post on r/conspiracy. Also the majority of the accounts I've seen nakedly shilling for Monsanto are pretty knew, and their overview is saturated with down voted comments, I thought this was common knowledge.

 Remember, Big Brother is always watching.    




 How about a round of applause for the PR department at Monsanto working overtime on a Saturday, Memorial day weekend just to spread a little more disinformation, and log some serious man/shill hours to manipulate public opinion, whatever the hell that is. I've been perusing the different mainstream websites and this global protest was barely a blip on their radar. I wonder how many new social media accounts were set up across the Internet to shill for Monsanto, thousands, tens of thousands? When does astroturfing online political forums by special interests group and corporations become something Congress gives a fuck about ? Course if Congress gave a shit about the general population this protest wouldn't have been necessary in the 1st place. With this corporate media and astroturfed Internet it makes u wonder when it will get noticeably absurd to the flock of sheep that watch the mainstream news, that it's all a sham, there could be looting and riots in the street outside your home as Fox   Friends prattle on about the War on Christmas. Grocery stores being looted and the military on the streets whilst the #1 story on Huffingtonpost is about Lindsay Lohan's latest arrest. Seriously though fuck paid shills, they irreparably damaged Internet discourse.

 Wow, CNBC has been criticized by everyone from Jon Stewart to complicit pawns in Congress for not doing a good enough job covering the financial crisis. There have also been outright accusations of CNBC acting as a PR/disinformation mouthpiece for the big banks and financial firms throughout the so called Great Recession and it's lead up. When CNBC FINALLY reports something noteworthy that doesn't look like it was vetted by PR firms, the $34 trillion lawsuit, the Senior VP's kids get murder-suicided by their nanny ? Looks like someone wanted to send a statement, BTW this happened last	October but I don't remember hearing anything about it in the mainstream, you'd think they'd be all over this 1, news network's VP's kids killed by evil Russian nanny, I'm no journalist but that sounds like gold Jerry ! Seems like it hit too close to home and other news media executives took notice, honestly I don't see how even by avoiding the lawsuit story angle this story wasn't everywhere, it was a blip, then it was gone, almost as if it was swept under the rug.  




 Just today someone on HuffingtonPost (I know), told me that conspiracy theorists are lazy and look for the easiest answer because they don't feel like doing the research. This was coming from a mainstream media Zombie who probably literally allows himself to drool as he switches between Fox, CNN, and MSNBC, like a baby being spoon fed. The antithesis of laziness would be to do your own research and wade into the conspiracy spectrum. Laziness would be allowing the same corporations that stand to make a fortune off of going to war tell you why the United States should go to war. Anyone who's combed the Internet for an alternative history of banking, wars, or genocide can tell you it's exhaustive work. I sometimes reminisce to how much happier I was back when I was just getting my "news" from Brian Williams and NBC, like a docile sheep, with an unoccupied patch of grass in the sun.  




 Great, now because of this useful idiot, trigger happy Americans will only get further entrenched in the idea that terrorism is a real threat. 1 idiot with a cleaver in London, is going to justify another trillion in defense spending to build instruments of death no one needs, shoot if the media hypes this 1 up enough they can spin it into another wrongful invasion/occupation of a Middle Eastern nation so the U.S army can liberate the oil and give more freedom to the U.S dollar, sure that works.

 OP better be careful he's bringing to much truth to this sub, cue the JDIF and occupation apologists calling me an anti-Semite based on nothing more than it being a reactionary self defense method that has served them well over the years in debates. Unfortunately for them I'm not white so I have no white or German guilt for them to take advantage of. Jewish people are genetically the same as Caucasian people, an Israeli population geneticist just confirmed this. The fact that Jewish people get all of this preferential treatment from the US and the UN is ridiculous, Jewish people are NOT a minority, real minorities in America, which are mostly poor people of color, don't consider Jews a minority, just a subset of white. For Gods sake look at their level of affluence, political, and business power they have amassed in America where they're supposedly being racially persecuted, gimme a fucking break, how gullible do u think I am ?  




 That's the 1st thing I thought of too.

 Few people have driven my present day worldview as much as this kind sage. The 1st time I watched the "Religion is Bullshit" clip on YouTube I was 17 and couldn't believe someone had taken on that topic so bluntly. I was just getting into Carlin beginning in 2006 then he died in 2007 and I became a rabid fan of his. Anyways the point is if Carlin could see the shit that is going on today, the bank bailouts, the looting of 401k's, and the talk of handing Social Security to the criminals on Wall Street he would be turning in his grave. He called the great Social Security Swindle that Congress is deliberating right now 10 years ago and about a dozen other things. George Carlin IS simply prophetic.  




 Worst yet were all of the agent provocateurs down at these protests. The agent provocateurs are the lawbreaking, violent ones that justify violence against the peaceful protesters, the agent provocateurs look like cops and talk like cops too, they're just uber well groomed guys with buzz cuts, jack boots, and band T-shirts.  




 I don't remember hearing anything about it and I couldn't find an Internet article from the mainstream media about this story. Just a DailyKos article and this 1 by Current.  




 As a former Occupier from Occupy Philadelphia, this is sickening, but its part of a trend of stifling 1st amendment rights by another name that is prevalent in the legal system. To this day watching that Philly cop nightstick that skinny, white kid the night that camp was overrun is 1 of the most frightening things I've ever seen in my life. I'll never look at a cop the same way again.  




 I can't believe this is going to be going on another 20 years, they just won't be happy until all of this ill will fostered in the Middle East courtesy of the U.S military creates an ACTUAL terrorist threat. If they're talking about the domestication of drone usage in America now, there's no way that nightmare doesn't come to fruition over the next 2 decades. How is the public so stupid ? We've had this faceless, undefined enemy for 12 years and we're quietly excepting another 2 decades worth of wasted resources like docile, patriotic, sheep. The novel 1984, should be a required part of the curriculum for high school students across America, of course the way this warmongering government is going it's more likely 1984 will be banned in public schools before its a part of the curriculum.  




 If she's not careful she could go the way of Senator Wellstone, he was also an outspoken critic of business as usual in Washington, except in his case it was the military industrial complex that brought his plane down.  




 Hmm, never thought I'd agree so vehemently about anything with a dogmatic, pedophile apologist but here we are. I guess my hatred for bankers out ranks my contempt for the  professional hypocrites that populate the Vatican.   




 This is a good list, it's hilarious when people say that corporations like Exxon or Apple are the largest corporations on Earth, and they they start citing market share and things like that but they don't stop to take into account that the foundation of the entire economic system, banks, are also private, for profit corporations, that exist only to create indebted masses. How could Exxon or Apple be more valuable than the banks that are backed by the entire Federal government and underwritten by our taxpayer dollars. Let's see how quickly the government would intervene with a multibillion dollar bailout for Apple and Google because they were to big to fail, no of course not, they would just allow Samsung to take over the market share and American tech start ups would get more R D investment. To this the critics say "oh well the banks provide a valuable service", well to that I'd retort, that I'd consider it valuable if they would at least let the taxpayer bend over first of their own volition instead of violently bending the taxpayer over the table and reaming us out.  




 Jack Ruby was also born Jacob Leon Rubenstein, why he changed his name I guess we'll never know. My guess, he didn't want to make it to obvious which group of people would benefit the most from the "single bullet/lone gunmen" theories. Kennedy had a non  interventionist foreign policy, which basically meant he would let Israel do its own dirty work which they've never been good at. Kennedy's vehement denial of Operation Northwoods coupled with Executive Order 11110 were enough to get him whacked. Not fighting Israel's wars for them and issuing gold and silver bonds to the tune of $5 billion in debt-free currency in effect circumventing the Federal
 Reserve, is evidently enough for a sitting U.S President to have his head blown off on live TV and not have anyone do anything about it.  




 I'd upvote this a thousand times if I could. It would've been a million hypothetical upvotes if it weren't for all the spelling errors.  




 Oh no someone said something bad about Jewish people on the Internet! Here comes the avalanche of shills yelling "antisemites!". The JIDF(Jewish Internet Defense League) is clearly well represented on Reddit.
Fun Fact: Reddit is owned by CondeNast, which is owned by Advance Publication, which is owned by the Newhouse family, the Newhouses are billionaire, print media tycoons. They are also aggressive Zionists who have used their influence in the media to drive a subliminal pro Israel narrative in the West decades before the Balfour Declaration was even written. 




 I posted an article about this the other day, and it got a lot of upvotes on r/conspiracy and even reached the top of the page. Despite all the upvotes, the comment thread was saturated by what looked like shill accounts using ad hominem attacks to discredit me and Dr. Eran Elhaik's findings. As a person of color and a 1st generation immigrant I find the fact that Jewish people who are closer to Caucasian than they'd like you to believe, use all of the advantages of this "Chosen People" blood claim to Israel to strengt their narrative. In fact Jewish people are some of the most powerful industrialists and bankers on Earth,and they still clamor for international support as an oppressed minority, when there are so many other groups who could use the resources being lavished upon the Zionist agenda. Also most actual minorities in America don't even view Jews as an actual minority, more like a subset of Caucasian, per capita Jewish people are much wealthier than any other religious or ethnic group per capita. Also there's the coincidence of Israel and AIPAC lobbying Congress to invade Iraq, Iran, Syria etc. basically because it's way easier to manipulate the war monger Americans to fight their wars for them using the media (which they also control 80% of) and off their regional enemies 1 preemptive mass troop deployment and ground invasion at a time. The fact is that Jewish people twist the oppressed minority narrative so much to the point it devalues actual victims of racial prejudices claims. Seth MacFarlane made a joke at the Oscars about how Jewish people control the media and he had the ADL (Anti Defamation League) down his throat with allegations of antisemitism and racism. All of this contributes to the narrative of America being post racial and overly politically correct, but its just sensitive Jewish special interest groups inflating the incidences of accusations of racism. BTW the entire reason the ADL was founded was to combat antisemitism, I'm on my phone and can't track down the Wikipedia link but it's there.  




 Bankers are in fact the root of all evil.  




 All that flowery: "We are all a global race man, we just need to set aside our differences and take care of Mother Earth" stuff is really nice and all in theory. Meanwhile in reality there are 1.6 million Palestinians are crammed into the Gaza Strip, of which 1 million have official "refugee" status with the UN. The Gaza Strip also has the 6th highest population density on Earth with 9,713 people per square mile in this landlocked, heavily policed, arid, baron sub-nation. Of course if you look at events in human history in 600 million year time spans, humans fighting humans over land is inconsequential but those aren't the units of measurement we are working with. Thousands of people that were children in 1948 when the original exodus occurred are still alive today; living on that tiny strip of land bouncing around between temporary borders; no nation to call home and through no fault of your own. The Palestinian people didn't get themselves persecuted all across Asia, the Middle East, and all of Europe and get themselves practically chased out of nations with torches. Look at what they have been reduced to; Gaza is a humanitarian crisis, as Israeli's are living in relative luxury on what used to be; just a generation ago Palestinian land and was that way for more than a thousand years. The Palestinian have become an international spectacle, they were not the world's burden, and now they have been reduced to 2nd class citizens in their own backyard.

 Yes, but isn't there a point in the evolution of human civilization where a Manifest destiny foreign policy is no longer acceptable ? Maybe 1 of the reason it's been so hard for "the Chosen People" to assimilate themselves in far flung nations and remain in said nation for an extended period of time  before being expelled. Notice Mongolia is no longer sending hoards of Mongols into China, it becomes antiquated after a while.  




 I don't think people here in America spend enough time recognizing the fact that 725,000 Palestinians were displaced and turned into refugees in 1948. Since 1948 their situation has gotten bleaker as it has become abundantly obvious that neither the United States, the UN, England or anyone else would be willing to back at the absolute rights for Palestinians living in destitution on the Gaza strip in refugee tents without access to water or electricity. 725,000 people, it may not seem like much but that's more people than live in Memphis, Washington or Boston. Imagine if the international community told the citizens of 1 of those U.S cities they would have to leave immediately and start their lives over again from square 1 in a tent in and around the old Super Dome, only this Super Dome is in the middle of the desert. Here in the United States things like that are only acceptable when they happen to black or brown people, and that is the entire crux of what I am trying to  say, Jewish people share more common DNA with Europeans and Asians particularly Slavic and Turkish than they do with people with Middle Eastern ancestry. This is about acknowledging a fact, I don't understand why we trust DNA in every other facet of life like determining criminal cases or the paternity of a child, yet this DNA is wrong or suspect because it doesn't fit the establishment's agenda. 
8 million Khazar's did not simply vanish into thin air, they converted to Judaism, and it is simply much easier politically for a group of people who are NOT believed to be Caucasian to occupy a nation in the Middle East than it would be for Caucasian's or at least it should be in theory. The problem is, real minorities in America, people of color and 1st generation immigrants, myself included in both categories barely consider Jewish people to be a minority, they are basically Caucasian at a glance and are also more affluent per capita than Caucasian's in Western Europe and the U.S. I know there is no such thing as birthright to a piece of land, but at the same time, Americans have never all collectively been ran out of their nation and turned into 2nd class citizen on what used to be their soil, a humiliation Palestinians deal with everyday. Look I'm a super liberal guy and I have a HELL of a lot more in common with the average person of Jewish descent than I would with the average Palestinian what with the fundamentalist religion and all that, but right is right, and pushing people out of their country to correct an injustice that occurred thousands of years ago is not right. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars#Theory_of_Khazar_ancestry_of_Ashkenazi_Jews 




 "Some point" doesn't warrant the modern day Manifest Destiny that is Israel's foreign policy in the Middle East. Israel's militant ways were on display this past Sunday when they attacked Syrians in Syria. All Zionists have in the Middle East as a foothold is this brief, erratic, cyclical nomadic wandering, and their own purported geneaoligic evidence of not being Caucasian, at least they did. That is not enough to justify this near 7 decade long military occupation and ensuing humanitarian disaster.  




 Yea but the Italians and Greeks aren't managing an ongoing humanitarian crisis in Israel by forcing 726,000 Palestinians off of their land and in the process of keeping them off of that land killing many tens of thousands more.

 To everyone here calling me an anti-semite:
A. You are predictable and boring.
B. Anyone who doesn't understand the inherent importance of this is being willfully ignorant of its magnitude.
C. Muslims are 2nd class citizens in Israel, and don't get me started on the perpetual humanitarian crisis that is the Gaza Strip.
D. Jewish people FORCED PALESTINIANS OFF OF THEIR LAND, they have no interest in living alongside Muslims and do what they can to create an atmosphere of intolerance against them. 
E. Their only claim to the land is from the Bible, nothing genetic, they may have in the tradition of nomadic people, blown through the area, but the historical claim belongs to the Palestinians, they lived there MUCH LONGER. 
F. 8 million Khazar's do not vanish, they simply do not, unless you're saying they were wiped out in a genocide, and I think it's best we don't stray into that area.
G. This is what Mahatma Gandhi has to say on the issue of Israel, and from what I hear he's kind of a pacifist:
Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home
 Mahatma Gandhi 




 That was great, so it was about the privatization of the press in America, I imagine it's a pretty well known fact amongst r/conspiracy subscribers that 96% of the media in the United States is owned by just 5 corporations, those 5 being GE, VIACOM, COMCAST, NEWSCORP   DISNEY.  Of course in Kennedy's day there were more than 60 independent news organization's, I don't think even Kennedy could have foreseen the erosion of the media to the extent that it has in such as short period of time. He gave this speech in 1961 and since then the media has been collectively bought and sold more times than I care to analyze.  




 The banker all the way to the left in that picture who has that permanently smug "Just stole your 401k" air  about him is Lloyd Blanfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, probably the most dangerous executive in the known Universe.  




 For some reason any Rothschild-related posts on r/conspiracy draw an even higher amount of shills like "BernankewasRight". That act as nothing but transparent PR mouthpieces for the banks.  




 This is so true, NPR Planet Money is an absolute joke, there isn't a thing that they've squarely blame on the bankers. There's always an extenuating circumstance or something they can blame the consumer for. When they interview bankers its to depict them as heroic or as martyrs for making a little less. Hmph Planet Money, more like Planet Shill.  




 He says right in the beginning of the article that he believes the players are different which leads you to believe the Rothschild's are no longer involved, but he doesn't name names of any prominent families or lone billionaire banker tycoons that could be. I wish he would've elaborated a bit further, something like: "The Rothschild's fixed the price of everything until ... ". By not listing a single other family like the Morgans, which leads me to believe that they absolutely are still involved.

You'll get a cascade of comments from faceless shill accounts using ad-hominem attacks to discredit your character. It's some serious Orwell shit.  




 No mention of either Rothschild or Rockefeller money there though, besides even if they did find any you certainly wouldn't be able to read about it in the New York Times. 




 As I begin typing this I am ready to be downvoted and called an antisemite, but this website Reddit is owned by CondeNast which is owned by the billionaire Newhouse family from the aforementioned article. They are 1 of the 6 families that dictate the narrative for the rest of the 96%	of the media they control to spin. The fact no 1 is allowed to say it out loud is ridiculous, there's a reason CurrenTV and Al-Jazeera are minisculed and demonized by Western media entities, its because they represent 2%	of the 4%	of the media they don't control.

 What a perfectly crafted piece of disinformation, by the way Woodrow Wilson would go on to say this of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913:
"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men." -Woodrow Wilson, after signing the Federal Reserve into existence 




 Men of Reddit and Harry Potter fans, are we thinking the same thing, "Petrificus Totalus" with that facial expression.  




 Reddit is owned by CondeNast, which is owned by Newhouse Publications which is owned by the Newhouse family. The Newhouse family are PROMINENT Zionists, and their family has owned newspaper and magazine publications since the 1880's. You know how people say Jews control the media well the Newhouse family is 1 of about 6 Jewish families that dictate  the mainstream media narrative.

 R/news banned me for what was supposed to be a 1 month suspension but has since become a perpetual suspension,  without any notification or reason,  other than only the mod that banned you can unban you. This ban came suddenly after I complained about Bipolarbear0's censorship directly to the mods of r/news.  I complained about Bipolarbear0 to the mods of r/news and the next time I posted an article about Israel/Palestine I was banned for posting opinion/analysis pieces. Pretty fucked up, you can't complain about the mods without being banned. 




 This post is complete bullshit.  How the fuck is this at the top of the page ? I see a lot of people complaining about the decline of this sub over the last few months but this post really underlines it. How the fuck can this guy liken a Jewish banking conspiracy to aliens or reptilians ? Its as if the Rothschild dynasty never occurred,  look at the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve for Christ's sake. This has to be the shittiest meme I've ever seen on here, and it's completely antithetical to what this sub stands for,  it completely disparages us Free Thinkers,  and yet there it is at the top of the page, mocking us. This post is above the 1 about Michael Hastings,  a real life conspiracy involving government assassination programs. I think this sub has been too badly compromised, its a shell of what it once was. Aliens, what nonsense.  I like my conspiracy theories how I like my data storage,  terrestrial,  fuck the cloud and fuck this meme.  




 Thank you, and yes I do feel like an idiot right now.  




 The whole time Rick was tussling with that guy in the bathroom I couldn't help but think think:

'How do the other guys not here them up there breaking things and what not ? '  




 So you just directly contradicted yourself, 1st you said:

"They would have to already be monopolies in their current areas for your claim to be true."

Then you said:

"So then my point stands, they are already currently in a monopoly in your area."

WTF ? 
Cognitive dissonance much ?

 I believe it, it's obscene how much clout Comcast has, I'm typing this from Center City Philadelphia, so I'm literally in the shadow of the Comcast Building/Comcast HQ. No one knows better than Philadelphians how badly Comcast fucks you every month, leaving you butthurt well into the next billing cycle. 

I pay $170/month for Internet, Cable and phone, and in return get the worst customer service ever and zero choice in subscribers. I've been talking about getting all of my entertainment from the internet for a long time but I haven't been able to effectively cut the cord. This merger has provided me the impetus to strike a symbolic blow against Comcast and sever the cord that has bound me to this monopolistic industry for far to long. 

What is so wrong about choice in a supposed free market ? What Comcast is doing is comparable to a corporation like Google, stopping Yahoo from allowing their service to be provided to entire regions, imagine that for a moment. Imagine if you lived in California you could choose between a Google or Yahoo search, but your friend in Seattle having to use Bing, because Bill Gates has got it like that in Washington state. 

TL?DR?
Fuck Comcast. They are the Rockefeller, Standard Oil of the 21st century.  




 He came it out of fucking nowhere and said that I, and Salon should be banned from r/conspiracy, with his fucking 2 day old, shill account. He just hijacked/derailed a thread of mine on r/politics, like literally within minutes of having commented on this article. I normally don't feed the trolls like that, but when a 2 day old account is calling for bans and censorship on r/conspiracy, who among us as an un-indoctrinated, free thinker can resist exposing them ?   




 Do what you want, take it up with the mods, IDK, more importantly you're a terrible Reddit commentator, please stop commenting on my submissions, you've totally hijacked/derailed this thread. Congratufuckinglations.  




 The mods. 

They will ban you if you flood new posts queue.  




 I'm allowed to post twice an hour, what the fuck is YOUR problem. This is the second time you've commented on 1 of my posts in 5 minutes and the 1st one was about how I, and Salon should both be banned from r/conspiracy. Looking for it now to copy   paste ... and you've deleted that comment because I exposed you as only having an account for 2 days. Thanks for your contribution to Reddit, u/-moose, "redditor for 2 days" /s.  




 "redditor for 2 days"

Really ? Thanks for the censorship suggestion Newbie. This is an important issue. Also I've posted more prescient content on r/conspiracy than your average free thinker, and anyone who's been on r/conspiracy longer than 2 days can confirm this.  




 NOOICE!  




 Alright, I'll just delete it then. 
 




 Gee, I don't know ?

Maybe because Obama didn't condone or endorse slavery, the article isn't about slavery and it has nothing to do with the subject. 




 So the fact that they are both Presidents isn't a factor at all ? Because it seems like most people would see the correlation immediately, but it appears to be lost on you. 

Yes, he owned slaves, is that the first thing you go to whenever someone brings up any of the Founders ? 

Seems like a pretty lazy observation to me, and one that completely misses the point of the comment. 

Why don't you go point out the fact that George Washington owned slaves to more people on Reddit, I'm sure no one knows about it, /s.

 Ok, apparently he didn't say that. George Washington did say this though:

I consider James Corbett to be the antidote to Alex Jones. 

In these crazy times, it would appear that the only person we can trust as a news source is a Canadian, English professor,  living in the sunny climbs of Western Japan, who distributes his alternative news for very little,  if any profit.  




 You hear that ? 

That was the sound of you nailing it. 

When I sold weed in high school it was exactly for this reason. I would spend approximately $60 a week on bud on average and by selling weed I simply opted to smoke my profit. I would literally burn the potential 3 or 4 grams of profitable of buds. I basically looked at it like a slice saved is a slice earned, and then immediately thereafter burned.  




 So it's all out in the open now ...  




 I can't believe there isn't more of an effort in Japan to stop these atrocities. There's no doubt that watching the documentary film, The Cove, will make you form some opinions about the Japanese. I can't imagine why the Japanese government wouldn't want to improve Japan's image with respect to whaling and dolphin hunting. The way I see it, the Japanese and Chinese are driving all of Earth's most stunning and intelligent creatures to extinction; purely to satiate their own savage barbarism. There isn't anything racist about it, it's a fact. It used to be the Europeans, then it was briefly America and for the last 30 or 40 years China and Japan are providing the largest markets for endangered species. Prove me wrong Japanese and Chinese users of Reddit.  




 Indian here, can confirm blatant racism from US military and the families of US military. It's not appreciated. Those idiots in the comedy club only condone that meat-head vet's behavior. Yes, I understand that the comedian and the vet made up afterwards and I'm sure they had a touching, interracial interaction that warms the heart. However, it does nothing for people that have had to deal with institutionalized racism coming from the US military and it being widely condoned throughout American culture. 

You could take the most liberal, white guy from California and if a US soldier was being racist to an Indian guy at a gas station calling him Osama or some of the other favorites, sandnigger or camel-jockey and the liberal white guy would go:

"HA HA HA ! FUCK THAT GUY ! RIGHT ? YEA ! 'MERICA !"

Just to appease some sort of societal expectation of patriotism. My generation is so brainwashed in this pro-war mindset, it's really sad. I was thinking about it this past weekend watching the pre-game military ritual's before kickoff in the NFL. The overt militarism, the blind loyalty. Also, not for nothing there are more than 1.3 billion Indian people on Earth, we literally comprise 1/6 of humans. So you come as pretty fucking ignorant when you just come out and accuse all brown people of  being terrorists. Again, yes I'm aware that the vet was joking, but just imagine if someone in the audience who was white made a similar joke about a black comedian with respect to lynching ? 

BTW, I welcome the downvotes, butthurt military members and family of military members. Don't take your overt hypocrisy in condoning racism against Indian people and blasting racism in any other situation, out on me.  




 This is a very interesting story. The FBI certainly appears to be keen to tie up what could be perceived as any loose ends in relation to the Tsarnaev brothers. I wonder what it is this man knew that made the FBI torture him like that. Also how fucked is it for the parents to have to make the world view these painful, private photos; just to find out the truth.

Try Google searching JIDF or Hasbara, but in your defense it did take me almost 30 seconds to find those sign-up/recruitment pages.  




 The US exposes AMERICANS to AMERICAN propaganda, the ISRAELI'S expose AMERICANS to ISRAELI PROPAGANDA, see the difference ? Or are you being paid to see the difference, and simply ignore it ?  




 Because the US exposes its own American citizens to American propaganda, Israel exposes American citizens to propaganda to get Americans to dislike countries in the Middle East; with the end result being the US sending Americans into the Middle East to fight and die in wars for Israel's interests. Israel is manipulating America into fighting its wars, and now they want to America to go into Syria and Iran for them. If Israel is so hellbent on restoring Greater Israel, then they should do their own dirty work. It's as simple as that, there's no Palestinian or Iranian equivalent of JIDF or Hasbara.  




 Maybe it's because there's no Arab equivalent of JIDF, there's just human beings out there that are sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people. The Palestinians are poor and impoverished, they are more focused on getting fuel,food and medical supplies past the Israeli blockade; they don't have the luxury of a paid Internet army of shills to astroturf, lie, shill and inundate the Internet with their propaganda. No country exposes another nations citizenry to such subversive propaganda.  




 So do you have to use a time-card to punch in for your JIDF job, or are you salary ? Does Israel give you health benefits to shill for them too ? Or are you just getting college credit to post your pro-Israel propaganda here ? People peruse the pages of Reddit as a recreational activity, not to be indoctrinated with pro-Israel propaganda. How many of these JIDF shills are there on this sub ? Keep on using your pro-Israel propaganda to justify your land grab. I try not to get in the habit of feeding the JIDF trolls, so I'm going to stop engaging with you seeing as how you're probably benefiting from the replies in some sort of bizarre JIDF, propaganda troll quota system. Here's some more links on Israel's Hasbara/JIDF propaganda program, and how it's used to manipulate American users of websites like Reddit:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Internet_Defense_Force

Wake up from your slumber Reddit, you are being barraged with propaganda courtesy of the Israeli Hasbara/JIDF program. 




 So far this thread is entirely comprised of JIDF trolls engaging in a pro-Israel circlejerk. I think Hasbara might be laying it on a little to heavy-handed, the propaganda is palpable to even the most casual of observers.  




 JIDF, please go away, get a real job. Do an honest day's work instead of subverting online political discourse with your shilling and lies. A quick scroll through your post history shows all you do is post pro-Israel propaganda on behalf of the Israeli government. This blatant propaganda being plastered all over Reddit is sickening. Here are some links proving how Israel is using JIDF trolls like /u/GeneralMunro to manipulate Americans into thinking other Americans have strong pro-Israel views:

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/students-offered-grants-if-they-tweet-proisraeli-propaganda-8760142.html

Don't fall for these JIDF shills. /u/generalmunro is at work right now for the Israeli government or some Israeli special interest group, and if you fall for his propaganda you are being worked. I'm sure /u/rosinthebow will be along shortly to defend his JIDF brethren, him and a bunch of other JIDF, pro-Israel propaganda agents. They could all be the same person for all we know, logging in and out of different accounts, it's pretty messed up. No other country subjects another country's citizens to internet propaganda via shills and astroturfing the way that Israel manipulates Americans.  




 I'm in, please mods, ban these trolls, a lot of these accounts strike me as JIDF at a casual glance. Anyone who unduly accuses someone of antisemitism to stifle conversation, critical of Israel should be banned. It's such an obvious subversion of the 1st rule of /r/conspiracy. All of a sudden you go from discussing the plight of the Palestinian people, to defending your credibility as an objective interpreter of events is Israel.  




 Why did we wait this long to make /u/axolotl_peyotl a moderator ? This should be at the top of the page of this sub and /r/politics, assuming counterpunch.com is even a domain that is allowed to be posted there.  




 Meanwhile, I was found ineligible for the ARD program which means that my 2012 misdemeanor marijuana possession conviction can never be expunged, and will remain on record in perpetuity.  




 Human error,  my bad.   




 Yea they do it to their own countries population,  they don't get on popular US forums for political discourse online to manipulate US foreign policy. China and America use propaganda to pacify their own citizenry,  Israel uses propaganda on Americans to sway public opinion on nations in the Middle East unfriendly to Israel.  AIPAC for instance lobbied Congress to go to war in Iraq, because it fits into a larger Israeli plan to destabilize the region. There's a big difference,  Israel is and has been attempting to control US foreign policy in the Middle East since its creation. If Israel has such a problem with Iran then they should handle that situation themselves,  instead they want Americans to go to Iran to die,  and murder innocent Iranian people. Israel should fight their own wars, or simply STFU.  




 You should change the part about the Federal Reserve to being aware that it is a privately owned banking cartel, operating for a profit for the same 7 families that have owned a stake in it these last 100 years.   




 Anything and everything Israel related gets met with an organized group of JIDF agents, acting in concert across /r/news, /r/politics, /r/worldnews, /r/conspiracy and of course the infamous /r/conspiratard trolls.  I started my Reddit career on /r/conspiracy this past February and have since moved on to posting in the larger subs, only to be met with an incredibly organized downvote brigade immediately after each Israel/zionism related post goes up. I'll literally have my lone upvote and 2 or 3 downvotes In a matter of seconds, its very frustrating. I can't get anywhere on those subs and am thinking about giving this sub the majority of my attention again. Also there's the fact that /r/news and /r/politics moderators hassle me daily, I've been banned and unbanned from /r/politics twice in the last month and am getting pretty tired of explaining to them how the AMERICAN Studies Association academic boycott of Israel is in fact US politics my eyes are going to pop out of my head,  the willing cognitive dissonance on behalf of those moderators is really unbelievable.  




 The JIDF is strong in this one.

 Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs...

 /m/todayIlearned83 told me that more than half of the article is pulled from other articles so despite being from a reputable website like BusinessInsider and being atop the page and having over 150 comment my post has been deemed Rehosted Content and will remain removed from /r/politics,  oh well back to the anarchy board.   




 What the fuck. 

This article makes my brown skin hurt.  




 UPDATE: /m/ todayIlearned83 told me that he made an error amd actually he meant to remove my post because it was Rehosted Content.  Apparently it pulled quotes from to many sources for 1 article.  WUT ? I also smell bullshit,  it was on the top of the fucking page,  let it stay up there, it was killing,  I appealed and I'll keep you guys posted,  I'm waiting on a response I was pretty diplomatic so IDK we'll see ?  




 This is the problem with Reddit, this is not a conspiracy,  this is a well known tragedy,  not a conspiracy.  Yes Jewish people turned the Palestinians into refugees and 2nd class citizens on their own land. If Jewish people have a problem with this they should stop being the most racist group of people on Earth and learn to live amongst the Palestinians peacefully. What kills me is that in America,  England and Canada Jewish people aren't even openly acknowledged as some of the most racist people, and somehow if you bring up their racism and how systemic apartheid is in Israel you are accused of being an antisemitic, racist, without a hint of irony.  




 I feel bad for you.   




 Yea, or at the top at the page. Can we have MORE picture plus 1 sentence political or social statement circle-jerks on this sub ? /s   




 I wasn't warned,  you're supposed to be given a warning,  I was just banned,  WTF ?!  




 Well Canada isn't doing it's best to send Canadian dual citizens to England to influence British foreign policy, there is no "Canadian lobby" in England; there to vote for increased Western intervention in the Middle East. America happens to have a great deal of politicians that are Jewish and therefore sympathetic to Israeli interests, coincidentally those same Jewish politicians always tend to vote in favor of bombing the hell out of other countries in the Middle East that doesn't approve of Israel. There is no Canadian equivalent of AIPAC, which tries to do its best to send young Americans off to the Middle East to fight for Israel's interests,  and at every opportunity they used their influence to put the United States on an inexorable path towards war with Iran. AIPAC, just recently put pressure on Congress and Obama to invade Syria of all places, Israel and these Israel 1st politicians just want America to do their dirty work. So now we want to put a self-admitted Zionist, Israeli dual-citizen in the 2nd most important position in terms of US finance ? That is absolutely ridiculous, it's to much of a conflict of interests. Moreover, this appointment would mean that they could not find an able economist throughout the United States to fill this position, which is something that is also ludicrous, and we need this financial wizard from Israel to come here and fix all of our monetary issues is preposterous. Also, how can you possibly compare a Canadian dual citizen, coming from Canada, a nation that isn't known for its controversial foreign policy, and also hasn't been overseeing an ongoing humanitarian disaster for the last 60+ years the way Israel has. I can't think of anytime Canada lobbied America and England to begin bombing a country in the Middle East because they didn't want to do their own dirty work. Israel is infiltrating US foreign policy at every level to ensure their own dominance in the Middle East. A quick look at the Bush Administration cabinet reveals how many of them were Israeli dual citizens, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Pearl etc., and sure enough they had a hostile foreign policy towards nations in the Middle East. In addition really, how the fuck can anyone compare Canada and Israel, Canadians are peaceful, and Israelis, are well, from what I can tell for the most part some of the most racist people on Earth. In Israel, racism is institutional, its taught to  Israeli children in their apartheid education system, children are taught from a young age that Palestinians are subhuman. Canadians hate American warmongering in the Middle East, Israeli's encourage it at every opportunity, and Zionist American politicians quite literally bankroll politicians that they know will vote in favor of US military intervention in the Middle East to strengthen Israel's interests in the region, which consist mostly of destabilizing the region. Also not for nothing, Jewish people make up just 2% of the United States population and 10% of the US Senate, an over representation in the Senate compared to their percentage of US population, a ratio that hasn't been replicated by any other minority in America.

 /u/nesckthe44 and /u/rosinthebow are paid JIDF shills by the Israeli government, a quick glance at their post history proves as such. Palestine has no such organization as they absolutely do not have the resources and are more worried trying to get building supplies, food, water, and vital medicine into Gaza through the Israeli blockade.

 Ad hominem attack much ?  




 Why don't you go have a circlejerk about my account in /r/conspiratard then, you do regularly comment there after all. /r/conspiratard is infested with JIDF scum, which I suppose is the reason you're so at home there. 

Say what you want to about my account, but at least I am not being given college credit or paid by some shady Pro-Israel PR firm to espouse my beliefs on the occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. I am doing this 100% free, someone has to give the impoverished Palestinians some Internet representation. Besides I don't like to make it to easy for you JIDF shills to collect your collegiate credit or shekels or whatever the hell they pay you guys with. 

As always, Free Palestine. That is all.  




 You jest, but those types of comments are exactly what cause posts like mine to be removed. If you were being sarcastic then you should have marked /s after your comment. How is anyone supposed to know you're joking, but then the entire post gets removed because of your complacency. The majority of the time that Jewish people make racist jokes on Reddit about themselves they don't identify themselves as being part of the tribe, and the entire post subsequently is removed. In addition, judging by the content that I post about Israel, one could easily understand how a sympathizer of Israel is pleased with the end result my post critical of Israel being removed. Every time you make a racist joke about Jewish without self identifying as a Jewish person I will report your comment, because by not commenting sarcastically you're painting all critics of Israel and the people that have upvoted my post as racist, anti-semites. Please try to pay attention or I will report your post for racism, indicate your sarcasm with an /s or identify as Jewish person, if you don't you make us look bad, which I imagine would align with your interests quite nicely.  




 I did not post this article to promote anti-semitic tropes sir. I'd encourage you not to engage in any racism on this thread as I do not condone racism in any way shape or form and shame on you for so blatantly lowering the level of discourse on this thread. I don't comment often, I'm more of a poster but I will not tolerate my posts becoming a forum for minority bashing. I am Indian, and there are as many Indian people in New York City and comparable numbers of Indian people in New York state as there are Jewish people, are you going to make some sort of taxi driver/curry joke about New York now ? What nonsense. I am reporting your comment, and will continue to do so in the future where I see fit. Take your hatred to a more close-minded sub. 

No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.

 James Corbett is an incomparable source of information, he is truly the antidote for Alex Jones. 

If Corbett had as many listeners as Jones and effectively became the representative for all things conspiracy, a position currently held by controlled opposition Jones, we would actually be taken seriously by people. Alex Jones has done an immeasurable amount of damage to conspiracy theorists with his ranting and raving. The mainstream media is comfortable with this paradigm, because juxtaposed to Jones they look like sane arbiters of information. What they don't want is Corbett sitting there with Anderson Cooper, professionally citing his claims in calm reasonable fashion, because that might lend us some credence. 

TL;DR ? 

If everyone who listened to Alex Jones apocalyptic sermons of gloom and doom stopped listening to Alex "never mention Zionism" Jones would subscribe to the Corbett Report, the world would be a better place.

 Unfuckingquestionably. 

What the fuck has anyone on this sub done to actually take a stand against their government ? None of us can even imagine being tried and found guilty of High Treason and swiftly handed a life sentence fighting simply for some semblance of an egalitarian society. I bet the majority of the people on this sub have never even attended a protest before and probably couldn't wait to shit on the Occupy protesters on websites like Reddit during those protests cause I mean fuck them right for actually doing something. 

Honestly this a serious question, how white is OP ? 

I've heard people accuse this sub of White Pride b4, but this is a seriously fucking piece of shit post. At least let the man's corpse get cold before u begin inevitably tearing him down.  

He spent 27 years in prison for the possibility that what he was doing would end the apartheid and oppression he watched his parents endure,  sorry if that doesn't impress the keyboard warriors of /r/conspiracy.  Clearly we are the real heroes /s. 

Something about the struggle of breaking free from apartheid and oppression stemming from colonial occupation must not resonate with OP. Probably difficult for most /r/conspiracy subscribers to empathize with an African, former political prisoner turned politician.

I'm not someone who comes here to accuse this sub of racism or anti semitism,  those are usually all bullshit cheap shots taken by shills and trolls.  This post however wreaks of racial undertones,  I'm neither white, black, nor African, I'm Indian living in America so Inc completely neutral here and this post does not sit right with me it just doesn't.  

TL;DR ? 

Yes Mandela is a hero, deal with it. He was no saint, his 2nd wife was a corrupt,  violent woman that would have ultimately tarnished his legacy had he not controversially divorced her and remarried a 3rd time. He kept close ties with controversial African dictators,  and I'm sure he had some skeletons in his closet as well, but a hero he remains none the less.

 Meet Noam Chomsky:Academic Gatekeeper.  

Noam Chomsky is on the forefront of an establishment co-opted academia. Chomsky for all his seemingly benevolent bespectacled insights about the state of politics in America propagates the 9/11 official story word for word when asked, and is also a proponent of the Federal Reserve System. Websites like Resdit and Democraticunderground prop him up as some sort of Dumbledore of the Internet, but don't be fooled by his faux establishment outrage. Chomsky is an academic gatekeeper and is a powerful form of controlled opposition for the elite.  James Corbett did a podcast about Mr. Chomsky exposing him as the mouthpiece for the elite that he truly is which I have linked to at the end of this comment. 

http://www.corbettreport.com/meet-noam-chomsky-academic-gatekeeper-video/ 




 James Corbett just did an amazing podcast of the Corbett Report about this very man called, Meet Noam Chomsky: Academic Gatekeeper. In the podcast Corbett asserts that Chomsky is on the forefront of an establishment co-opted academia that increasingly espouses the beliefs and talking points of a government moving in greater lock step with the military industrial, big oil, central banker operated oligopoly. The podcast analyzes how academia has gradually shifted to become more conservative in the wake of the Vietnam war, and the public relations disaster that ensued on college campuses across the United States in protest of US intervention, which was partially organized by academics that had moral codes. If you don't have time to listen to the podcast which I am linking to at the bottom  this comment, it goes into several other establishment-friendly opinions that Chomsky has supported in the past. Spoiler alert, it turns out that Mr. Chomsky has previously stated that he has no opinion about the Federal Reserve either, he also manages to do some good shill work for fiat currency, he's a real piece of work. I wish so many otherwise rational people wouldn't be so easily hooked in by has anti-Bush rhetoric and soft-spoken, bespectacled persona he has carved out for himself on websites like Reddit or Democraticunderground. At the end of the day Chomsky has nothing truly controversial or groundbreaking to offer the world political discourse, he is a co-opted academic gatekeeper, who does his best to reinforce the false right-left paradigm that plagues this nation so. In addition, I can't recommend the Corbett Report podcast enough to the subscribers of /r/conspiracy.

 Hello Mr. Greenwald, I wanted to know your opinion on the Guardian newspapers recent interview with legendary, muckraking journalist Seymour Hersh, and Mr. Hersh's offhandedly mentioning that in his opinion the Osama Bin Laden raid was, in his words "one big lie". What are your thoughts on the Osama Bin Laden raid, do you agree with Mr. Hersh ?  




 Hello Mr. Greenwald, first and foremost thank you for all of the incredible journalism over the last few months and over the course of your career. My question is in reference to the MARINA revelations, do you believe that the US government is actively using data gathered via the MARINA program to create a list of Americans considered, for lack of a better term as "undesirables", and based on that classification thereby likely to be targeted by the US government's various agencies for a higher level of scrutiny, such as the  IRS or the Department of Homeland Security ? I know it's quite a leap, and a journalist such as yourself doesn't make claims he isn't prepared to immediately back up with evidence, but I'm asking for purely your opinion and I would like to make that clear, any answer I receive from you will be regarded purely as speculation, unless you say otherwise at the beginning of your response.

 October 1st is the end of the Fiscal Year, by the way, so the military rushes to expend whatever it has left on its budget before October 1st 2014 or the remaining balance may be deducted from next year's military budget, which is something that the Pentagon and the military industrial complex can not allow to happen. This is the reason that you see a lot of military drills and military activity in September, and the reason that you keep seeing the date October 1st over and over again is because it is the end of the Fiscal year, god this is such a stupid post, I honestly can't recall the last time I saw such transparent bullshit atop /r/conspiracy. This post is so stupid it makes my head hurt.  




 This was either posted by an idiot or a shill to discredit this sub, either way this is a terrible post and as someone who is India I wish we didn't gravitate towards the whole ancient alien/vimanas shit. The entire ancient alien theory is reprehensible for so many reasons, and it really drags down this subreddit. I mean, in this day and age with quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve, billion dollar bailouts for broke banks that are "Too big to fail", and an American war machine on overdrive looking for any possible reason to bomb a country with brown people and their own ideas on the banking system and this is what is getting to the top of the page, a bullshit post about ancient aliens with ZERO evidence. Why don't you try something more tangible, more realistic, MORE TERRESTRIAL. Seriously go fuck yourself if you upvoted this, because you sully the term "conspiracy theorist".

 I want to learn how to play the theme song from Breaking Bad on an acoustic guitar so bad. 

How is it that you hear a theme song for a television show, think nothing of it and 5 years later it's used in such an amazing fashion that you really can't get it out of your head at all ? 

I'm gonna have that twang stuck in my head all week and think of Walt's empty chair and what's to come next week.  




 "redditor for 9 days"

Well there is that, and the fact that Israel pays college students to tweet pro Israel propaganda   wage online comment thread battles for Israel.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/students-offered-grants-if-they-tweet-proisraeli-propaganda-8760142.html

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896

Based on that, my JIDF detector is going through the roof, so I suppose the answer to your question is Yes, I think it's possible that you could work for the JIDF.  




 Listen 869689698 as an /r/Judaism subscriber, Jewish person and ardent supporter of Israel I think any comments submitted on this topic on your behalf should be taken with a gigantic chunk of rock salt. You'll excuse me for not suspecting you of being JIDF, y'know based on your comment history, less than 2% of the US is Jewish, and yet all of you seem to be on Reddit, and very opinionated on Reddit at that.  




 "redditor for 4 days"

Substantial amount of overall comments are on articles about Israel and posting comments favorable for Zionism, must be JIDF then  




 "redditor for 4 days"

The JIDF is strong in this one.  




 Yea but they are in the minority and even then they do nothing to illuminate other Jewish people as to the problems caused by Zionism, passive or aggressive. It's just to much of an inconvenience for them because they become Black sheep in the Jewish community, personally I can't recall an instance of a Jewish person in the public arena calling Israel out on their apartheid and ethnic cleansing. With all of the famous liberal Jewish actors, comedians and television personalities you'd think at least 1 would come out against Israel. 




 Thanks for the insight JIDF shill, every other comment in your comment history is about how Zionists are amazing, and should just take over the entire Middle East, so you'll  excuse me for not readily believing the propaganda you're being paid to disseminate.

I do have a couple of questions for you, how much are they paying you ? 

What's the average worthless shill of a human being whoring themselves out for these days ? 

Do you get paid by AIPAC directly ? 
 




 "His car was found the next day at an antiques mall next to the Susquehanna River, and his county-issued laptop and hard drive were found months later in the river." 




 Reasonably prepared, I always have at least 7 days worth of chronic on me to ride out the initial storm.  




 It's never enough for Israel, is it ? Defend your own fucking military occupation ! I don't want the apartheid and ethnic cleansing in Palestine to be an Uncle Sam joint. BTW you'd think 65 years of substantial foreign aid and military aid would be enough for the Chosen People, but NOOO !!!! It's never enough for Israel.  




 This is 1 of the most fucked up statistics in politics, 1.7% of the population and 13%	of the Senate, unbefuckinglievable. ZOG (Zionist Owned Government) is in full effect.  




 We had to struggle with the old enemies of peacebusiness and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering.

They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.

Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for meand I welcome their hatred. 

  Franklin D. Roosevelt

(Obama has yet to make a speech declaring the equivalent, I'm no fan of FDR but the man nudged us in the right direction, Banking Act of 1933, Glass-Steagall, where's the financial reform you promised Mr. President ? Dodd-Frank ? Gimme a fucking break.)

 FUCK Woodrow Wilson, peace of shit  ruined the entire country, BTW everyone, he was talking about the handful of Jewish families that own the Federal Reserve, the Rothschilds, the Warburgs, the Lazards etc. when he was referring to the power you can't criticize, good luck trying to convince everyone a small group of Jewish people control the entire monetary system.  




 I'm just sorry it took this near miss with Syria for people on this sub to realize who the real enemy is.  




 I know, worst yet I posted this to /r/news and it was predictably buried and ignored amid other news articles that all appeared to beating the war drums, and loudly.  




 It would be my greatest sadness to see Zionists (Jews) do to Palestinian Arabs much of what Nazis did to Jews. 
 
 Albert Einstein 




 Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home

 Jeez, no wonder they won't just go back to Poland, Hungary, Russia and Germany, as Helen Thomas implied in her now controversial video, Hungary expelled them in 1349   then again in 1360 and 4 times in total. The other countries of Eastern Europe are all featured here as well, this is what I've always contended about the Jewish people, either entire regions of Earth are hateful bigots, or Jewish people have a problem taking advantage of society. How could this many people be bigots in this many instances over the course of nearly 1800 years ? It's a completely ridiculous notion. There's no way that many groups of people over the course of nearly 1800 years have come together as a society and decided that the best course of action for the future of that society would be to expel a segment of the population that tends to find employment in the finance sector, and soon without fail become the wealthiest members of that society and use their new found wealth to subvert that societies laws by making the ruling class, nobility or government indebted to them. It's called a cycle and cycles repeat themselves, in 1939 Hitler sent 937 Jewish refugees to America on the MS St. Louis and America did not except them so there's that as well.

 Oscar Wilde 




 The term "Jewish Human Rights Group" is ironic if not an oxymoron entirely.  




 I know, it's tragic, especially when you consider what a model human being Roger Waters is in almost every aspect of life. If these Jewish people who are professional victims successfully change the public opinion, whatever the hell that is, of Roger Waters it'll prove that up is down, black is white, and that Jewish people are able to hijack the narrative of any discussion to reduce to its semantics, like calling Roger Waters a racist, anti-Semite for calling them out on their engineered humanitarian disaster in old Palestine.  




 It really doesn't take a genius to figure out why, just google The New York Times Company and you'll see it's owned by the Sulzbergers and its so no secret the Sulzbergers have donated more than a few shekels to AIPAC   Israel over the years. 




 It's called a link.  




 Not to mention Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs, I'm pretty much certain Goldman Sachs of all financial firms is only allowed to hire Jewish people to top positions, it's so explicit in the name that only Jewish people can make it there to positions of power.  




 All I'm going to say is that I've never even heard of a poor Jewish person, they are all rich, in the Philadelphia area where I reside, the most affluent townships and neighborhoods in Philadelphia are entirely Jewish. I really have never heard of a Jewish person being even lower middle-class, it just doesn't happen. There are to many other Jewish people in high places, especially Ashkenazi Jewish people to allow a fellow tribe member to struggle in any way. It's pretty much racism to the umpteenth degree, Jewish people only hire and promote other Jewish people. Perfect example David Stern is the NBA commissioner and his replacement, whom he handpicked is the Deputy NBA commissioner Adam Silver, Adam Silver will be the 5th NBA commissioner in the NBA's history and the 3rd Jewish person to hold the position. Mind you there have only ever been approximately 40 Jewish people to ever play in the NBA in it's history.

It can't all be shills and trolls, how many idiots are on r/conspiracy ?

 The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.

 Honest to god nothing makes me lose as much respect for this sub as anything alien/reptilian related, it humiliates to me see this nearly at the top of the page and know that I am so heavily entrenched in and associated with this subreddit. With so much shit happening TERRESTRIALLY that we are aware of such as false flags and privately owned banking cartels operating as central banks for nations, dubious r/conspiracy users try to derail that very real discussion by flooding this sub with the paranormal, why not post ghost videos while we're at it. Now I'm not saying that my theories are better than your theories, but my theories are better than your theories and the alien topic drags down the level of discourse on this sub to the level of a teenager with an active YouTube account and a subscription to the Coast to Coast channel.

 Zionists own the biggest media corporations, Sumner Redstone   Les Moonves own CBS. The Roberts family owns Comcast which owns 51% of NBC and they are also Jewish. The Sulzbergers own The New York Times Company, Bob Iger owns the Walt Disney Corporation. Then you have the Newhouses who own Conde Nast which owns Reddit, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair just to name a few. Look I'm on my phone so I'm not digging up the links and those are just the Zionists who own media corporations that I can think of just off the top of my head, good luck getting any of them to report it. Alex Jones is even terrified to mention Israel, he blames all of the turmoil in the Syria squarely on powerful Shiite Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Quatar, and Turkey, it's pathetic. Oh yea and there's Sirius XM which is also an entirely Jewish operation founded by someone named Rothblatt and the current President   CCO is Scott Greenstein, it goes so deep its blatantly obvious that Americas mass media is owned by Zionist Jewish people, even Reddit.  




 Gonna get downvoted for saying this but here goes, the alien stuff is bullshit. The alien/reptilian stuff is a gigantic circle jerk and its a powerful tool to discredit more serious minded conspiracy theorists by proxy. The government, the banks, the mainstream media, the military industrial complex and academia love it that someone like Peter Joseph is on par with David Icke or other well known conspiracy theorists that are nothing more than well publicized crackpots. I'm not sure if David Icke is a complicit troll, engaging in the most elaborate PsyOp in recent memory or he's unwittingly done the most damage to the conspiracy theor movement. Either way David Icke or aliens in general shouldn't be the immediate response in peoples minds to conspiracy theories.  




 Israel is the only other foreign government they are sharing American citizens data with. While the NSA is sharing this information with other defense agencies most notably the DEA, Israel is the only foreign government with unfettered access to US citizens data.  




 I agree this is 1 of the best articles I've read analyzing the situation in the Middle East over the last dozen years from a semi well known media establishment. I don't even know how it was allowed to be published; it seems loaded with language rife for Larry Summers' attorneys to be able to lay waste to in court. I imagine there is no shortage of judges licking at the chops to rule in favor of Summers' in a libel case; it's a shame, he's a powerful man. However more power to Alternet for publishing this, this is a REAL analysis of the Middle East turmoil of the last dozen years.

 India would not be on the side of the US Allies, it would either be on Russia's side or most likely neutral. Delhi is a long time ally of Moscow, and Russia has a history of selling India weapons. During the Sino-Indian war in 1962 between India and China, Russia supported India and America remained neutral just to give 1 example of many. Trust me, India would remain neutral until Russia and China had their backs against the wall and then when the time comes they would have to throw in with Russia and China. This map is incredibly lopsided towards favoring America, even Venezuela is listed as a US ally, I don't think OP has ever heard of Hugo Chavez. America already has a technological advantage, that we're sure of, so why skew the map unnecessarily in the US' favor ?

 The use of depleted uranium by the United States, Israel and the UK is without a doubt a crime against humanity and it doesn't get nearly enough attention. No one else uses it, just those 3 countries. Say what you want to about Russia and Syria, they don't use depleted uranium rounds, which BTW were only ever justified by the US to the UN in the 1st place specifically to pierce Soviet tanks to spray Iraqi   Afghan civilians with 50 caliber rounds who BTW are not in Soviet tanks.

 It has to be on /r/conspiracy because for some reason everything Israel-related ends up getting taken down by /r/news and /r/worldnews because the comment threads get overrun by JIDF shills commenting antisemitic rhetoric to paint all critics of Israel as ravenous antisemitic, racists and nothing else. Also /r/news mods have shown a pretty transparent pro Israel bias in the past, even though its a fact it has to be relegated to /r/conspiracy to make sure it will remain posted, it's sad that JIDF's disinfo is so well implemented on Reddit. By being on /r/conspiracy this issue will be disregarded by most as something to the effect of an old rock star off his rocker. Waters stance will be twisted, misrepresented and mislabeled until this whole brave boycott is rendered to a footnote on his otherwise decorated Wikipedia page, under the "Late Career Controversies" section.  




 " I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested.

 I wouldn't be surprised by that. The same statistic is probably true for Egypt and Iraq and elsewhere we contribute massively to.  

Do me a favor. Find the statistics for Egypt and Iraq also. Or other high end donation locations. Let's compare. Because I am seriously doubting is the only place for such things. 

 Or maybe it would be better not to call people children for thinking differently. Yea, that seems like the more commendable thing to do.

1. Afghanistan
2. Israel
3. Iraq
4. Egypt

So there goes your "serious doubt". Israel received more aid than anyone from 1976-2002, and Afghanistan and Iraq only entered in 2002, when we began making in your words "massive contributions" to Iraq and Afghanistan in the form of aerial assaults and carpet bombing cities. The only countries that get more than Israel are ones with ongoing wars with the US, last year the average Afghan earned approximately $430 in US Foreign aid and the average Israeli earned $405 in US Foreign aid, so its still pretty close.  

Also bravo for taking such a courageous militant pro Israel stance I bet that must've been really hard for you to do being a white, Christian man in America. Tell me did you face any harassment or career issues being staunchly pro Israel. It must've been really controversial I mean. 

 Or maybe it would be better not to call people children for thinking differently.

Gimme a fucking break kid this is r/conspiracy if that's the brave insight you arrived at is that Israel is great and all Arabs are crazy then you just failed, unsubscribe and spend more time on r/Christianity, you'll find all the Palestine bashers there queued up for

 Here child, cry about the following damning statistic from this article:

"US taxpayers contributed more to the Israeli Defense Forces last year than Israeli citizens have cumulatively in the last 3 year."

So as you can see it is no understatement to say that Israel's army is bought and paid for by the US taxpayer. This article is from Business Insider so I hope it passes your Zionist approved news establishment criteria.

 Are you stupid ?

Or are you honestly implying that the Israeli	 government spends 100% of its Gross Domestic Product on defense and nothing else They don't have roads or hospitals or schools there to manage ?  Or do you just not understand these acronyms, I knew I made the mistake of engaging a know-it-all, Jesus freak kid but had I known you were just an idiot this whole time I would've ignored you, oh well lesson learnes.

Largest recipient yes. What does that have to do with the fact that it's gdp far exceeds US aid.

Yes 1 number is larger than the other 1, good insight kid.  




 Illegal occupation? That's a made up term. 

Unlike you, I don't give a fuck. I don't have preferences. 

1. I'll admit that illegal occupation is a made up term when you admit "Jewish" is a made up ethnicity, they are rich white people with big noses, who exploit laws against discrimination and turned themselves into a new group of people post               Holocaust.  The Palestinians are a hell of a lot more Semitic than all of the Ashkenazi Jews running Israel, and an Israeli population geneticist from Johns Hopkins came to that conclusion. Jewish people are Khazars or	Asiatics, and the fact that they get treated like they are an oppressed minority in America is laughable. It's amazing before World War II it was considered racist to refer to Jewish as an ethnicity instead of a religion which had been it's designation for millennia. All of a sudden in the early 1950's America discovers a new ethnic group, the mysterious Jewish people, absolute bullshit, now it's considered racist to refer to Jewish people as Caucasian.

2. For someone who purportedly doesn't give a fuck you've been doing a lot of shilling and distribution of disinformation on this thread. So then why the angry fingers there keyboard warrior ? What is the JIDF giving the most annoying shill an Applebees giftcard as a bonus this month or something ?



 




 You're a religious person, so in the words of Voltaire if we believe in absurdities we will commit atrocities. You are the 1 who brought up the Torah's justification for the state of Israel and it's no secret that there are enough crazy, Bible thumping Christians in America who support Israel specifically because it is believed Jesus will be resurrected in Jerusalem. So you're allowing your own religious beliefs and you are an ardent Christian and subscriber to r/Christianity, to influence your opinion on the illegal occupation of Palestine, which is foolish to say the least or dare I say it even asshatish to use your term. So like just how crazy religious are you ? I mean you believe in a 2nd coming of Christ so you're definete at least a little impartial and thereby less credible, if everyone is aware that you are really only supporting Israel out of fear and self interest that you won't meet your Space Jesus than it sort of makes your support illegitimate or at least disingenuous. So are you going to deny your level of religiosity now too right here in front of r/conspiracy, and remember, GOD IS WATCHING !  




 Why don't you use more ancient scriptures that were written in a language you can't even speak yourself to decide more pressing geopolitical issues, tell me what does the Torah say about Rwanda, what does the Bible say we should to address rising sea levels ? You see how much of an idiot you sound like when you use the Torah, a book written thousands of years ago by desert dwelling nomads to justify a modern day apartheid and ethnic cleansing. Hey by the way while you are at it what does the Bible say we should do about nuclear Pakistan ? This is r/conspiracy leave your bullshit Christian ideology where it belongs, in r/Christianity.  




 How many more lies will you spout on this thread for Israel ?

" Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of military assistance from the United States since World War II, followed by Afghanistan, Iraq, Egypt, and Pakistan.[22]
Since 1987, the U.S. has provided an average of $1.8 billion annually in the form of Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and funds to support research and development.[2]A bilateral memorandum of understanding was signed in January 2001, at the end of the Clinton administration, under which defense aid was increased to $2.4 billion annually from $1.8 billion, while the $1.2 billion of economic aid would be eliminated. This was predicated on the basis of the defense aid being increased by $60 million per year until the full amount was reached in 2008, while the economic aid is decreased by $120 million per year until eliminated.[3][23] In 2007, the United States increased its military aid to Israel by over 25%, to an average of $3 billion per year for the following ten-year period (starting at $2.550 billion for 2008, growing by $150 million each year).[24] The package started in October 2008, when regular economic aid to Israel's economy ended.[25] Officials have insisted the aid is not tied, or meant to balance, simultaneous American plans to sell $20 billion worth of sophisticated arms to its Arab allies in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia.[25] Former U.S. President George W. Bush assured Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that the U.S. would help keep a "qualitative advantage" to Israel over other nations in the region.[24]
The United States is the largest single supplier of military equipment to Israel. According to the U.S. Congressional Research Service, between 1998-2005 the U.S. accounted for the vast majority of Israel's arms transfer agreements, accounting for $9.1 billion out of $9.5 billion worth of agreements.[26]Israel deals directly with U.S. companies for the vast majority of its military purchases from the United States, though it requires permission from the U.S. government for specific purchases. Permission is not always automatic; for instance, in March 2000 it became known that the Israeli government had been refused permission to purchase BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles.[3]
Israel has the world's largest F-16 fleet outside the United States Air Force. With the delivery of 102 F-16Is, scheduled through 2008, the Israeli Air Force will have a total F-16 inventory of 362, in addition to 106 F-15s.[27]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_military_relations#Military_aid_and_procurement

240 billion is Israel's GDP, you knew I was talking about defense aid from the US specifically but you intentionally took me out of context, classic shill move.

I'm going to sleep now shill, I'm sure I'll return to an Inbox of lies and propaganda in the morning. 




 Why are you bringing in irrelevant points?

Easy there God boy.

 




 All of Israel's technology exists solely because of the American taxpayer, and all of it will be rendered useless in the event of a prolonged mass ground warfare, Israel simply doesn't have the bodies for a prolonged, bloody ground war with Iran and its 75 million united Shia Muslims who are salivating at the notion of war with Israel. Israel is so tiny and densely populated that their civilian casualties would skyrocket in no time, Iran still has enough large swaths of land and friendly neighbors to constantly be staging new strategies and moving large amounts of troops around comfortably and quickly, Israel on the other hand barely has enough space to engage in large military drills without entering Palestine. In a 1 on 1 prolonged war with Iran, Israel always loses. Israel really couldn't hang for a long ground war with many nations, they would end up dragging the United States in, which in turn would  bring in Russia on the other end, so basically we're risking nuclear war for greedy Israel, which you've made abundantly clear that you are all right with, anything for your Space Jesus.  




 YOU are the problem, it's called an ultimatum, 1 side is right and 1 side is wrong, get informed before spouting your nonsensical "We're all 1 species on 1 planet and we have to come together" shit, please spare me. Why don't you go to the Gaza strip and tell those refugees living in destitution and squalor because of Israel's blockades and security, that they all have to come together and to be nicer or something. Go to the Golan Heights where thousands of Bedouin people are living in tents and are about to be further displaced so Israel can build 1200 luxurious settlements and condominiums and tell them to try smiling. Maybe while you're there you can recommend The Secret, oh yeah and definitely be vague, positive, judgmental, ignorant, opinionated and ultimate unhelpful like you were in your last comment on this thread, that was perfect. 




 So what you're saying is that Israel is going to make the United States fight Iran for them, because everyone knows Israel doesn't have it in them to throw down with Iran alone, they lack the manpower, will and national identity and would crumble amidst the 1st real damage to their safe, walled, enclosure-nation, away from the world. AIPAC also lobbied aggressively for the US invasion of Iraq as well as a complicit Zionist owned media misleading  the sheep-like American public along the way. So if it wasn't for Israel getting America to do all of their dirty work for them, that delusional map you linked to really wouldn't be possible now would it ? BTW don't count on a war hungry American public to fight another 1 of Israel's wars for them. Also I take it from your username that you were born in 1991,   yet you speak so casually of mass casualties across the Middle East just so the Israelis can have their blood drenched, biblical land of Israel in all their greedy glory. I bet the toughest thing you've ever done is snipe some Middle Eastern characters on Call of Duty or some other video game, you know nothing of the world. Big talk you've got there, but what's the end game for Israel, what if somehow against all odds Israel managed to achieve the atrocity that is that map, then what, does your space Jesus come back in Jerusalem or something ? No he doesn't. He never does cause it's a fucking fairy tale, how come religious people are unable to comprehend the notion of ALLEGORIES. I'll tell you what will happen though, greedy Israel will continue to expand East into they run into either nuclear Pakistan or nuclear India, take your fucking pick because I bet you in your infinite wisdom which you've accumulated over the course of 22 years as a religious Christian, are also ready to nuke the world so Israel can have a little more land and you increase your likelihood of meeting space Jesus from your fairy tale a little bit more.  
























 Can you provide 1 example that something like that even exists ? I don't think you can, because I'm certain that it doesn't. Whereas there are numerous examples of the JIDF existing and thriving.

I look forward to your response, and please, please try to stay on topic. I don't need any of your 'whataboutisms', masquerading as excuses for Israel's pervasive social media propaganda program.  




 Damn that's a great painting.  




 Well this is legitimately depressing news.  




 Okay.  




 That particular podcast was especially epic. It was the 2nd podcast of yours that I listened to, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could revisit this topic in the near future. That Brookings Institute paper that you sourced, Which Path to Persia,  was equally illuminating and infuriating.   




 First I just want to say thank you for doing this AMA James.

With that being said my question is what do you consider to be the smoking gun of all well regarded conspiracy theories.  What grand government conspiracy do you think suggests that things are not in fact they way that they seem and that we are being deceived on a massive scale, involving an elaborate conspiracy encompassing powerful interests in the fields of mass media, government,  finance, etc. ? Basically what is/was the conspiracy that opened your eyes to the alternative news world of conspiracy ?  




 The submission has been up for over 2 hours and no one has pointed this out yet so I'll go ahead   do it. Malaysia's Prime Minister made this very controversial statement while hosting the heads of state of nations like Iran and North Korea. You also have the fact that [Malaysia's Prime Minister also hosted a 9/11 Truth Conference in Malaysia in 2012.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HZdgaViIyI) 

Of course 2014 was the year of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 which plunged the nation into chaos and destroyed a great amount of faith in the Malaysian government. The plane going missing basically was and continues to be a PR nightmare for the tiny, island nation that dared to speak out against the most powerful forces in the world.   




 Nah no problem, for the record I agree with your comment. Just saying that "the Jews" are in control of the world economy is an irresponsible blanket statement, and gives ammunition to those that would seek to discredit us as being racists. Its far more accurate to say that Zionists are in control of the world economy, case in point, Joe Biden, a self-professed Zionist. I'll chalk it up to being an error in delivering his message by the Prime Minister, obviously English is not his first language.  




 What are you talking about, he says right in the beginning:

"Today the Jews rule this world by proxy, they get others to fight and die. They invented socialism, communism, human rights and democracy, so that persecuting them appears to be wrong. So they enjoy equal rights as others. With this they have gained control of the most powerful countries."

I don't get it, are you hoping that people don't watch this 2:40 second video and just read your comment ? Also the title I went with is the same title as the video on YouTube, I never alter the titles of my submissions. I always go with the title that the person who submitted the original content decided was fitting. Literally the first words in the video are, "Today the Jews".  




 How is this a petition of poll ? I don't see why it was removed, its a straightforward article. Can you please indicate where/how it is a petition/poll ?  




 Shill, baby shill.  




 Right ignore my links and evidence that would implicate you as a paid Israeli shill. 

I'm sure I'll see you on another comment thread about Israel, defending their various land grabs, apartheid practices and continued collective oppression of the Palestinian people.  




 Said the guy who does nothing but post pro-Israel propaganda all day like its their job, which it very well could be. Just a casual perusing of your account shows that all you do is defend Israel with zero nuance in your comments. There isn't one condemnation to be found, and before you begin acting all incredulous about me accusing you of being a Pro-Israel hasbara shill here more than a few examples of this type of pervasive activity taking place on social media.

[There's Israeli college students that do it on behalf of the Israeli government.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/)

[Then we have this article about it from the HuffingtonPost.](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/14/israel-pay-students-propaganda_n_3755782.html)

[BBC also wrote an article about this highly manipulative practice employed by Israeli's and the Israeli government known as hasbara.](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896)

[There's also the case of a user known as HamBaconEggs who plagued CommonDreams.com with anti semitic comments from something like 20 different accounts just to make it seem like that Jewish people were being persecuted on CommonDreams and it was a bastion for anti-semitism. Pretty despicable if you ask me, considering the fact that CommonDreams is reader supported and funded. HamBaconEggs and his 20 other accounts were all the same person and CommonDreams had to launch an investigation to get to the bottom of it. They tracked him down using his IP address and found out that it was just 1 graduate student in the Midwest,  highly manipulative and despicable practice.](http://www.commondreams.org/hambaconeggs)

While the whole Western media quibbles away on whether or not Israel is technically engaging in apartheid and ethnic cleansing, Israeli settlers continue to seize more land, with barely a murmur coming out of the Western press about it.  




 Swede !  




 Right, well your buddy on this comment thread Kobe got shadowbanned for trying to incite a witch hunt against me so I'd be careful about conspiring witch hunts against me on my own comment thread. Its a violation of Reddiquette to initiate witch hunts against other users. As for reporting me to the admins, go right ahead I have nothing to hide. My IP address proves I am 1 person with 1 account. So happy witch hunting. 




 If only India and China would set aside their differences and unite forces with Russia to create an Eastern block that could greatly raise the living standards of people in those 3 nations. They've been divided to the benefit of the West for far to long. Divide and conquer, the old adage rings as true now as ever. 

How can the BRICS nations really expect to give the existing world order a shake up with their 2nd and 3rd most powerful countries constantly at each others throats over control of Southeast Asia ?  




 Again, instead of ignoring me and attempting to incite a witch hunt against me why don't you address me directly ?

How do you think I am manipulating votes ? 

Are you sure you're not just butthurt because the majority of my submissions to /r/politics regularly make the front page ? 

Cause it certainly seems that way to me.  




 WTF are you talking about !? 

Please cite how I am "clearly gaming the system."

You are inciting a witch-hunt against me, which can get you shadow banned. I look forward to your response on how I'm gaming the system. Sorry my posts regularly being at the top of the page here and resonating with the /r/politics community has you so butthurt /s.  




 I agree, my favorite thing about listening to his podcast is his even keeled nature. Alex Jones, with his fear mongering and bombast does the entire 'conspiracy community' a disservice by acting so crazy on national television. 

Corbett on the other hand has a very professorial style of delivery, with his constant citations and level tone of voice. I've referred to him a few times here on /r/conspiracy as the antidote to Alex Jones.  




 Literally the 1st paragraph in the article:

'The number of homeless residents in New York City, the largest city in the United States, reached a record high this month at more than 56,000 people. Halfway around the world, another metropolis recently hit a homeless record of its own: just 1,697 people are currently homeless in Tokyo, also its countrys largest city and the most populated city in the world, a record low since surveys began in 2002.' 




 Do you have any links citing even 1 example of people being paid to post pro-Palestine or anti-Israel material ? 

The answer is no, because no such program exists.

[Again, just provide one credible link that would suggest that Palestinians even have the resources to employ a subversive social media propaganda of the like that Israel has employed for several years.](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.541142) 




 Said the guy whose entire account is seemingly dedicated to defending Israel. At least half of your comments appear to be in defense of Israel. Sorry my posting articles about this obvious apartheid is forcing you to work extra hard in your Israel PR /s.  




 I have my reasons. That'll have to do for now.  




 Hello Mr. Gage, my question is what you think of former Senator Bob Graham discussing the redacted 28 pages of material from the 9/11 Commission Report ? 

Former Senator Graham has stated that what is in those 28 redacted pages directly links Saudi Arabia to the 9/11 hijackers. If that is the case, do you think that a grassroots effort by your organization could place pressure on certain key elected officials to introduce more bipartisan legislation to get the 28 pages declassified ? 

In other words, could it really be that simple ? Now I'm aware how secretive the federal government is with their classified documents, like how there are still documents that relate to the Kennedy assassination that are classified. Do you think that the 28 classified pages could be the holy grail of the 9/11 truth movement ?

 Thanks, they haven't responded to my last retort and that was over an hour ago. 




 This is the 1st reply message I received from a mod at /r/worldnews, its from /u/green_flash:

"Not every Israel/Palestine-related story is major world news. This one surely isn't."

I'll keep you guys posted.  




 That is a great quote,  its the open secret that no sitting politician is allowed to utter. Scratch that, no important public figure is allowed to utter, anyone who has a voice out there that shines a light on this fact is immediately slandered, discredited and derided by the very machine they attempted to expose. Nixon was a dirty politician and he gets the entire force of the media brought down upon him. Whereas someone like Bush can steal an election, invade Iraq, create a decade-plus long clusterfuck in the Middle East, oversee an economic calamity and never seriois talk of impeachment. Its absolutely because someone like Bush is a staunch ally of Israel. Nixon illegally wiretaps a handful of politicians and he's the greatest enemy to freedom amd liberty to ever sit in the Oval Office, Bush amd Obama illegally wiretap the entire country via the NSA and those very same media establishments largely trip over themselves to defend and justify their actions, effectively pacifying the public. The level of hypocrisy is unbelievable.  
 




 Is it any coincidence the media then sought out to destroy and marginalize Nixon forcing him to resign. Think of all of the atrocities committed by other presidents before and after Nixon, the media didn't make it their sole purpose to force them out of office. Gee, I wonder why ? One of these things is not like the other. It is often said that the media destroying Nixon post-Watergate was the 1st demonstration of, "the power of the press", they sure aren't kidding about that. Was it really about Watergate, or was Watergate just a convenient excuse to get rid of the last president that wasn't completely subservient to them ? 




 I messaged the admins about you, you are insane, you are deleting your comments to cover your tracks, but you are spamming this same comment in the comments section of all of my /r/worldnews submissions. You have dedicated this account to defaming me and assassinating my character, you are a spammer, you are stalking me on Reddit, and are sending me harassing PM's. BTW, the fact that you have to resort to this kind of ad hominem attacks and character assassination only proves that you are losing the debate on the actual issue (Israel/Palestine). This is classic PR, you're losing the debate, so you are attempting to slander and defame me. I'm through messaging you as you don't respond to my comment here in the comment section, you'd rather send me harassing personal messages. Stop personal messaging me, 1 day-old account.  




 I don't get, bunny388 are you an Israeli hasbara/JIDF shill ? All of your comments in your 2 month old account are pro-Israel talking points right out of the Israeli hasbara-handbook.

 It seems like you created this account just to disparage me, that's pretty fucking nutty. Then you dig through my history to come up with that character assassination, your account is just 38 minutes old. The fact that you have to engage in such ad hominem attacks and character assassination just proves that you're losing the argument on the actual debate which is Israel and Palestine. Try staying on topic instead of creating gimmick accounts to attempt to assassinate my character.
Enjoy stalking me you fucking nut. I'll certainly be here continuing to expose Israel's many crimes against humanity. As for all the nonsense you just spewed, I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.

 Bingo, I've been exchanging mod mails with /u/EightRoundsRapid, /u/DonTago and /u/anutensil about the removal all morning. All post them here later when I'm through exposing the hypocrisy.  




 Yea, but those people are not being compensated for doing so like the Israelis are, its misleading to suggest that they are. No other country offers college credit for propagandizing social media websites like Israel does.  




 "outright left Gaza."

Maybe outright left a smoldering hole where Gaza used to be. You're delusional if you think that putting up blockade walls around the West Bank and Gaza is not annexing it. They have checkpoints for Palestinians to cross into Israel in the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinians can't even get simple building supplies and medicine through Israel's inhumane blockade, leaving the Palestinians to fester in an open-air prison. Israel is overseeing a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. So if they don't have boots on the ground there its okay, as long as they imprison and confine them it doesn't count as annexation, good fucking luck with that 1.

 Right I forgot, any news source that is staffed predominantly by Arabs is considered "a local source" and not credible in the eyes of the mainstream media, remind me again, what is the ethnicity of the people that run the mainstream media, cause it certainly isn't Arab ?  




 "Oh my God ! Stop the fucking presses ! An Arab, drove his Jihad mobile into the Holy Land and started selectively taking out God's Chosen People its practically the Holocaust all over again ! You do remember the Holocaust, don't you ? "

That's just a brief summation of what I think David Brooks would've written in the New York Times today about it, David Brooks, whose son BTW is enlisted in the IDF, a fact the very influential New York Times journalist has failed to divulge in years of his employment at the NYT and years of his sons enlistment in the IDF.    




 This is the response I got from the mod u/EightRoundsRapid : 

"Is every road traffic accident world news?" 




 He said, without a hint of irony.  




 No other country does what Israel does in their Israeli hasbara program. Don't try to act like Russia and China have such pervasive propaganda programs, they actually have enough people of Chinese or Russian descent to actually be sympathetic to their cause and realize that their nation is rarely the aggressor in international disputes. Its usually the warmongering United States. Here are some links about Israeli hasbara and the JIDF, thought it sounds like you have your mind made up and are going to try to minimize the affects of Israel's government mandated international propaganda program:

 Never mind, make that 3 times you've referenced 1 removal of a story critical of Palestinians that was removed.  




 How many times are you going to cite that 1 example, this is the 2nd time you've done so, just on the comments for this submission ?  




 They also just removed this story about an Israeli settler running over 2 girls in occupied Palestine, killing a 5-year old under the auspices that and these are the moderator, u/EightRoundsRapid exact words:

"Is every road traffic accident world news?"

Here's the link to my submission:

http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jr046/jewish_settler_runs_over_2_palestinian_children/

I messaged the mod in question about the selective censorship that had taken place and I'm awaiting their response.  




 That's right, keep on blaming the victims. Clearly the oppressed are the ones with all the power in the situation /s.  




 I wonder how long until the mods remove this for some bullshit, contrived reason. Anything critical of Israel must go. Just ask u/anutensil. That mod is practically an Israeli hasbara agent.  




 I think since Israel's war on Gaza this past summer the censorship has increased greatly. The PR battle on r/worldnews was evident to anyone who spent time there, that's also when they introduced filters, the first filter was "Israel/Palestine". Israel-related news stories also get downvoted into oblivion like never before as well, I can't submit anything about Israel without it immediately showing zero upvotes and just 25% or 50% upvoting it.  




 Here is the reply I received from u/anutensil about the removal of my submission:

"News about Israel   Palestine has always tended to overwhelm /r/worldnews, so guidelines were set in place years ago about what is considered major and what should be directed to /r/Israel or /r/Palestine, which were created, in part, to handle the overflow.

This particular story may become more significant in the future, but considering the context, it is not considered a major story at this time."

Make of that what you will. I don't know how much energy I have left to continue going to r/worldnews to keep on fighting the good fight. 

I was going to get into a long exchange with u/anutensil about this, but I just didn't feel like it today. [Also, what with the recent news on how Google News will now start including r/worldnews in their search results you have to expect that the likes of u/anutensil will be flipping the subjective censorship into overdrive. I knew as soon as I read about this, that it would even further negatively impact r/worldnews.](http://searchengineland.com/internets-front-page-reddit-now-worthy-google-news-205180)

R/worldnews used to be a place where you went to get the news stories that the mainstream media ignored, it is now a shell of its former self. All you get there now is the mainstream media echo chamber, its basically a sub dedicated to Russia/ISIS/Ebola-fear mongering. 

You certaintly won't hear anything critical of Israel there anymore, not after Google basically condoned r/worldnews selective censorship by putting them alongside the mainstream news outlets in their news search results. I'm certain the admins also congratulated the mods of r/worldnews on that recent revelation and probably told them to keep up the good work, or something to that effect. 

Furthermore, I don't think anyone should come down to hard on u/AssuredlyaThrowAway, he's the lowest mod on their totem pole, and to expect him to burn bridges in worldnews just to make a statement is childish. If you want to direct your ire somewhere, direct it to the mod that is responsible for this, u/anutensil. There's 26 mods on r/worldnews and he only has 1 account and 1 vote.  




 The mods said it wasn't posted in the appropriate subreddit. This, a story about settlers from one country, burning down a mosque in a different country is considered to be, "Not Appropriate Subreddit". I took that to mean that any criticism of Israel is not appropriate for this subreddit. I really can't believe it. They removed it about an hour ago and I messaged them about it immediately, I still haven't heard back yet and I'm sure they are going to drag their feet on this, if not ignore my message entirely. With this strategy, they get to put off approving the submission until tomorrow morning when the submission will be, approximately 20 hours old and still be sitting at the same 870 upvotes that it garnered in just 9 hours. Thereby relegating it to no longer front page material, effectively censoring it out of visibility. The mods think they're so clever. That's what's going to end up happening to my front page submission about this subject. It was critical of Israel so its not appropriate for this supposed worldnews subreddit.

 Red Ice Radio. 

Red Ice Radio recently got banned from iTunes because they aired a podcast with the director of our recent documentary of the week selection, Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told. In that podcast they discussed historical revisionism and how the victors of World War II are the only ones allowed to expound anything about World War II or Adolf Hitler.  




 Its not my title, its the title from the author of the article. I never alter the titles of my submissions to mislead Redditors into upvoting clickbait titles that don't accurately reflect the authors intended message in the article.

 People don't want to know, the average American appears to be blissful in their ignorance. The way that Americans are taught history is in a childlike good vs. evil paradigm, there's no room for nuance in this paradigm. Take the biggest history lesson we're given in our compulsory education for example, World War II. We're taught that the Allies were the good guys while the Axis nations were pure evil, that is the same application used to judge world events by Americans. They're happy being the good guys, as juvenile as the notion is.

 I got banned from r/documentaries for reposting this after it was initially removed. 

They definitely don't want criticism of Israel to become a regular thing over there. About a month ago, I got a documentary about AIPAC to be #1 on r/documentaries with over 1000 upvotes and more than 1000 comments. 

After I began inquiring to the mods about why my doc kept getting removed and why I was being hassled about reposting it, they accused me of having an agenda and not wanting anyone to use r/documentaries as a platform for anything in particular. 

When I asked if the fact that the submission was about Israel had anything to do with it being removed, I was derided for being a conspiracy theorist. Shortly thereafter I was banned. They accused me of having an agenda, when I countered and said it was in fact the mods that were removing documentaries critical of Israel and they were the ones with the agenda, I was banned. 

I messaged them 2 hours ago about my ban, and nothing yet. They responded to the rest of my messages pretty quickly, so we shall see ...  




 NOOICE !  




 Sure, 100% of them are rapists, murderers and thieves, that's what private prisons consist of. 

There's no way the vast majority of prisoners are nonviolent drug offenders /s.  




 You should have made a self.conspiracy submission about you being banned from r/history for posting this documentary. It would illustrate the level of lockstep being used to suppress this documentary. This documentary was also removed from YouTube and Vimeo. If it happened to me I would definitely let people know that I was banned simply for suggesting a documentary.  




 Loud and clear. 

Over.  




 [Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=eaf_1382262528)

This documentary is responsible for radically changing my worldview, more than any other film I've ever seen. 

I consider myself above all to be a history buff, conspiracy, trivia, popular culture, these things come after what I consider to be a very good grasp of history. When you find out that you have been lied to you, your entire life, about the events that occurred in World War II; you will feel completely betrayed/hoodwinked by US history or propaganda on the matter. The propaganda is so pervasive and saturating that you will not be able to get over the deception. There has never been a more 1-sided story told, than the story of Adolf Hitler. 

Also as an added caveat, this documentary has the rare distinction of being so controversial that it was censored by YouTube   Vimeo. 

This documentary answers so many questions, and it portrays Hitler as being more than your usual psychopathic, power-hungry, raving anti-Semite. 

If you really want to go down the rabbit hole, you have to watch this movie about the greatest conspiracy of all, the fact that our own history has been hijacked. The 'history' that we are taught in our compulsory state-mandated education is nothing more than Ally propaganda, amplified by 70 years of documentaries   Hollywood movies vilifying Hitler.

If you do decide to watch this documentary, just keep 2 very prescient quotes in mind beforehand:

He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past. 

 George Orwell, 1984

 

History is written by the victors.


 Winston Churchill

Also, take into account that in the 12 years of compulsory education that you receive in the US, you don't spend a single history lesson learning about World War II from a German perspective. In democratically electing Hitler, Germans are written off by Western historians as collectively being gripped by a national lunacy. My response to this method of 1-sided teaching of a subject as expansive is World War II is utter incredulity. How can you expect someone to know anything about a war, when they are only teaching 1-side of the issue ? 

After you watch this movie, it will become apparent that we are all the victims of rampant historical revision. Everything that Hitler accomplished in a short amount of time, like lifting tens of millions of Germans out of dire poverty, has been effectively revised out of all the history books. Now, even if you are taking a college level history course, all that is taught about Hitler is that he was a raving racist. Not that his Chancellorship oversaw the most astonishing economic recovery in the history of human civilization. The fact that Hitler began issuing government-sanctioned currency and went around the fiat currency, central banking system that he saw as parasitic; was revolutionary. 

The real reason the powers that be went after Hitler is because he sought to systemically change the banking system, he wanted to issue debt-free German currency from the central government. The powers behind international finance could not allow such a thing to occur as it would expose their parasitic, money as debt, fiat currency system.  




 YouTube and Vimeo have both removed this documentary. The only quasi-well knows website I know that hasn't censored this documentary, LiveLeak. Just the fact that Vimeo   YouTube wouldn't allow this documentary on there websites speaks volumes.  I know its 6 hours but once you start watching it, it really begins to fly by. 

Best, most mind-blowing documentary ever. 

All I can say to people considering watching this documentary is to prepare to change your worldview in its entirety. 

Also, before you watch this movie, ask yourself 1 question:

How come in the 12 years of compulsory education you receive in the US where you get World War 2   the Holocaust drilled in your head from the Allies perspective every single year, how come you don't spend a single history class studying World War 2 from the German perspective ? Why is the German interpretation of those events never taught in school, even for a single history lesson ?  




 Just to let you know, the mods deleted your top comment on this thread. Pretty fucked up if you ask me.  




 Yea Afghanistan is also currently under military occupation by the United States, that is why its foreign aid levels are currently so high, whereas Israel's foreign aid is never going to go away. Afghanistan is getting foreign aid from the US in return for being occupied by tens of thousands of US soldiers, continually for the last 5 years. 

Remind me again, when was that long US-Israel war that the United States is still repaying Israel for ? Oh right, it never happened, so why the fuck are we giving them so much foreign aid ? 

Furthermore, the average Israeli gets more than $408.40 a year, per-capita from the US taxpayer, compare that to the average Afghan, who gets $423, per-capita from US taxpayers and has to put up with that pesky, US military to boot.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid#Recipients

 The real reason the Israeli defense minister is saying these things is because Turkey is planning on sending an aid flotilla through the Israeli blockade of Gaza to get much needed food, medicine and water to the people of Gaza. [No one has done more for the Palestinian people than Turkey, and that is what really bothers the Israeli defense minister. When he says "supporting terrorism", what he really wants to say is, "supporting Palestinians".](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/europe/turkey-aid-flotilla-is-planned-for-gaza.html?_r=0)

 Yea right, sorry the Palestinians can't be as honorable as the Na'vi from Avatar. 

These people have been oppressed more than any other group of people on Earth and now they are being given grief for resorting to guerrilla tactics. 

The Palestinians are living under the an occupying regime, when you are under occupation you resort to tactics you otherwise wouldn't. Its as simple as that, use guerrilla tactics against a better funded, better equipped enemy with strong international backing, or perish. 

The Palestinians are resisting an occupying force, a practice as old as warfare itself. 

The Israeli's are wantonly wreaking havoc across the West Bank and Gaza to try to force the Palestinians out. All the Israeli's have wanted from the Palestinians from day 1 is the Palestinians land and for the Palestinians to then promptly fuck off. 

Just look at the most recent, brazen, theft of land in the West Bank. Netanyahu just got behind a podium 2 days ago and announced that Israel would be stealing 988 acres of Palestine. No reason in particular, just for the fuck of it. How can anyone just announce they are annexing almost 1000 acres of another country. 

Anywhere else on Earth what Israel just did would result in war with a neighboring country. Why should the Palestinians be held to a higher standard when they are literally watching their future country disappear around them, 1 illegal land seizure at a time.  




 I like the [Kennedy Assassination: 24 Hours After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLtiw_x-Ik8)

It does a great job depicting all of the strange things that happened in the immediate aftermath of the assassination. I think the Kennedy Assassination is the ultimate conspiracy, it laid the foundation for the shadow government and military industrial complex to completely control the United States. Kennedy was the last, real Commander-in-Chief, or at least he thought he was, right until the end.  




 The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. 

 George Orwell 




 They just removed this story from /r/worldnews entirely, the highest spot it now occupies is #34, its not on the front page at all. What a goddamn shame. Shit like that really destroys my faith in Reddit.

No sub bothers me as much as /r/wordnews. Its always the same recipe, remove all submissions about Israel that are climbing to the front page of r/worldnews, and when a post starts climbing to the front and the comments haven't been rigged in favor of Israel, just remove it for being "covered by other articles". I love it, covered by other articles, has to be the most bullshit reason to remove articles. 

if a Palestinian fires a rocket during a ceasefire its all over the front page of r/worldnews, multiple links at a time, but when Israel ends a ceasefire by annexing nearly a thousand acres, its nowhere to be found on r/worldnews. 

If you want to know who rules over you, find out who you are not allowed to criticize.  




 The land was taken first, that is not a question. The land was taken, then the rockets began coming, let's keep out timeline straight here. Its not like the Palestinians just began firing rockets 1 day for the fuck of it. They were dispossessed, put under occupation and were forced to live as 2nd class citizens with permanent refugee status in their own country. Then came the rockets.  




 That video is hasbara at its finest. The only way they could have done it better is by having it posted it by someone who doesn't have an account full of pro-Israel talking points. Had they posted it from an account that stayed away from the entire Israel-Palestine conflict it would have made it appear as though, this Redditor was objectively impressed by the Iron Dome's technological capabilities. 

I can't believe these hasbara agents are doing so well on r/worldnews and r/news that they've begun bleeding into other major subreddits.  




 This is Israeli hasbara, propaganda at its finest. [Here is a link about the program Israel has, where they pay college students to astroturf social media forums with pro-Israel propaganda and talking points.](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/14/israel-pay-students-propaganda_n_3755782.html)

All u/KVillage1 does on Reddit is defend Israel and their atrocities. Just casually peruse through his post history, almost every single comment is in defense of Israel. There is no nuance in his iterations, just Israeli propaganda. If Israel is in the right here, then why do they feel the need to pay Israeli college students to disseminate this sort of propaganda. [Here is another link on this incredibly dishonest and manipulative practice that Israel engages in by having paid propaganda agents on social media hubs like Facebook and Reddit.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/)

The Palestinians don't have paid PR agents to astroturf their talking points on Facebook all day, they are more worried about getting food, water and medicine into Gaza, past Israel's inhumane blockade. Instead all the Palestinians have is people like me, who can see past the media blitz and all of the Israeli internet propaganda to make this look like an even sided battle. It is not an even battle, 1 side has sophisticated, US funded technology, whereas the other is being kept in an open air prison, otherwise known as the Israeli blockade. 

How can these Israel apologists expect the Palestinians to be subjected to being held in the deplorable, sub-human conditions, that Israel has subjected the Palestinians people to. Israel are the conquerors, they are mostly European Jews, colonizing a Middle Eastern nation. How can you possibly expect the native people to not try to fight against an occupying force ?  




 "The main points were: one, the amount of Israel's nuclear weapons, how many Israel had, that no one could predict or know, including the CIA. They were thinking about a number like 10 or 15. But I came out with a number between 150 to 200."

 - Mordechai Vanunu
 




 Please provide an example for these baseless assertions. Otherwise you are attacking my character simply for standing up for the rights of the Palestinian people, the victims in this quagmire. 
 




 "OP, you've admitted to jew baiting."

WTF !? 

When did I admit to, in your words "Jew bating" ? Why don't you hurl some more baseless ad hominem attacks at me without addressing the topic whatsoever.  




 I just wish this story was getting more traction. U wanna hear something spooky ? So I went to post this article to r/worldnews and it, unsurprisingly had already been submitted. Here's the scary part, when I clicked on the username of the OP, u/drone499, it turns out they had been recently shadowbanned. 

Further cementing my theory that the most taboo subject on Reddit is pro-Israel astroturfing/Hasbara/JIDF. I accused someone on r/worldnews of being a pro-Israel shill about a month ago, and I was promptly reported as a spammer and had to spend the next 2 hours exchanging messages with the admins to prove I'm not a spam-bot or spammer. 

If there is 1 thing that is off-limits on Reddit it is Hasbara/JIDF. It's scary to think about how much influence these pro-Israel shills have on this website. They seem to operate with complete impunity. 

Here's the link to the submission to r/worldnews about this subject, then click on the users profile, this was most likely the last thing he ever submitted to Reddit.

 I fucking love CommonDreams for doing this.  




 This song was pulled from the US release of Is This It due to the line, "New York City cops / They ain't too smart"not exactly a popular sentiment in the wake of 9/11.  




 That cop looks like a cross between Hank from Breaking Bad and Michael Chiklis's character from the Shield. 

Man, I watch way to many cop shows. I've always thought that all the cop shows on television are to condition us to love the police.  




 That cop looks like Hank from Breaking Bad.  




 Maybe if there wasn't an Israeli blockade stopping Gazans from being able to tend to their wounded this would've never happened.

Say what you want to about Hamas and their primitive rockets, Hamas are not the ones imposing a blockade on Israel and forcing them to live in an open air prison. Gazans can't even get medical supplies, water or food and they are the ones getting all the grief. 

Maybe these rocket attacks were retribution for Israel's blockade stopping someone in Gaza from saving the life of a loved one. 

If you want peace you have to end the blockade, take down the Great Apartheid Wall of Israel. No one has ever been able to strike a peace deal with an oppressed minority group by keeping them locked in an open air prison and rationing their calories.  




 As a former Sikh, current atheist, I can't begin to describe how reprehensible I find this story. Its very believable though, both times in my life that I've been called a sandnigger it was by 2 different white guys in pick-up trucks. 

I hope they hit this piece of shit with hate-crime charges, the race of his victim was clearly foremost on the assailants mind during the attack. 

Seriously, fuck this guy. The last time I was called a sandnigger was when I was crossing the street, walking home from high school and this dude, completely unprovoked yells at me as I'm reaching the other side of the road:

"Fucking sandnigger !" 

Then he just drove off, I couldn't even believe it had happened I was like in shock. This piece of shit was like a middle-aged guy just driving around his pick up truck calling young, brown men sandniggers. This all went down in a suburb of Philadelphia, so not exactly the deep South, and we still have this kind of simple-minded racism.

 Thanks, 2 day old account.  




 I didn't put in quotes, the author of the article put it in quotes. I thought it would be disingenuous for me to alter the title in any way. I never change the titles of my submissions. Maybe if you actually clicked on the link you would've noticed that little detail.  




 I bet your buddy Howard Stern loves the idea of this boycott /s. I'm sure you heard his temper tantrum last week about how apparently if you're anti-Israel then that somehow makes you anti-America.  




 Yea those comments are murder. I wish someone would take out the best clips of Joe and Abby talking Israel/Palestine and make it into a condensed version of the podcast video that isn't 3 hours. I'm trying to avoid having to edit the video myself and post it here, but it was a great conversation. It takes Joe a lot of balls to critically discuss Israel/Palestine like that, living in Los Angeles and working in Hollywood he's really playing with fire.  




 If I know Israel and their PR machine, they're going to turn this kidnapped soldier into Woody Harrelson's character from Wag the Dog. 

They're going to have carefully arranged PR stunts surrounding the soldier and his safety and well being. Maybe a viral picture of the kidnapped soldier looking rugged and handsome or something that will resonate with American military families.  




 I posted a comment yesterday on r/worldnews yesterday about the presence of JIDF and hasbara on Reddit and I was promptly reported for spam. I spent the next hour explaining how I'm not a spammer or bot to the admins to avoid being shadowbanned. In case you're wondering who reported me it was u/foamed. They don't want you talking about JIDF or Hasbara on Reddit. At least that's what I gathered. What a cunty way to silence dissenting voices.

"Tappers numbers are accurate, but there remains some question about who bears responsibility for the deaths of every Palestinian child. As such, we rate this claim Mostly True." 




 Corbett Report is really an amazing source of information. I think that James Corbett is the perfect representative of the conspiracy community, with his professional citations and calm speaking voice James is an indispensable source of strange but true history. The fact that he is able to come off sounding so calm while saying terrifying but true things is the best part of his delivery. The mainstream media is more comfortable with ranting and raving Alex Jones as our figure head, alienating new people from joining or learning more about 9/11, JFK, etc. James Corbett, in more than 1 way is truly the antidote to Alex Jones.  




 White House then proceeds to green light the replenishing of all of Israel's artillery stockpiles to further enable the bombardment of the Palestinian people.  




 Thanks u/jennyMcbarfy, I messaged the mods of r/spam and told them about what had just taken place. Had you not made me privy to the fact that u/foamed had reported me for spam I'd be shadowbanned right now and I might still be, but in the meantime I'm here.  




 That was the most fucked up video I've seen in quite a while.  




 I think the CIA only released this now because they know that all of the precious few Americans that would've greatly cared about this a few months ago are so tuned out focusing on the madness taking place in Israel/Palestine and Ukraine/Crimea. Basically, who's got time to worry about the erosion of Congress as an institution in the face of the National Security/Military Industrial complex when we are imperiled with World War 3 or the massacre of the Palestinian people.  




 I'd love to see them explain this 1 away. Did they have to apprehend that boy and tie him to their windshield because Hamas is stockpiling rockets in his pockets ?  




 Really !?

Way to silence dissenting voices on Reddit. 

So if you support Palestine then you deserve to be banned.  




 Seriously you're going to report me for spam because I don't share your opinions on Israel, you're a real piece of work. Someone doesn't agree with you so you try to take away their ability to have their voice heard.  




 This post is such pro-war propaganda. OP should be ashamed of themselves for posting such a blatant example of what is clearly hasbara at work. This whole sub has completely changed. Hasbara agents have infiltrated this sub. I get my posts removed if they have a single of instance of opinion or analysis, but this just rockets up to the top of the page. Gee, I wonder why ? 

I have had both of my articles removed from r/worldnews today, supposedly because 1 was Opinion/Analysis, funny thing though is that it wasn't. My other submission was climbing near the top of r/worldnews and was critical of Israel, can't have that now can we mods ? They took it down and said it was covered by other articles. I asked them for an example of my article topic having been submitted and they haven't gotten back to me yet, go figure. This is blatant selective censorship of anything that isn't complete pro-Israeli war propaganda or hasbara as they refer to it.

 O A every day that's what I say.  




 Full text in case of paywall, although I didn't get 1:

Over the past two weeks, an increasing number of Facebook pages are reporting on people who express joy at the deaths of IDF soldiers or speak out harshly against the war effort, and calling for them to be dismissed from their jobs.

In some cases the efforts of these individuals have led to dismissals of people who came out against the IDF, or expressed happiness over harm to soldiers. For example, Hadassah College in Jerusalem withdrew a scholarship to an Arab woman student over a Facebook post. Hadassah College President Berthold Friedland wrote the student: We read your post with shock and disgust. Friedland also wrote that until clarifications are completed and the police deal with it, the college management has decided to prohibit you from entering the campus for any reason, academic or other.

Other educational institutions have issued warnings to their staff and students that they must avoid extremist and inappropriate statements on social media, and threatened disciplinary action or to go to the police.

Facebook pages of this type, such as Boycott Haters of Israel, Fifth Column in Israel have received between a few thousand to tens of thousands of Likes. In one case, the administrators of the Facebook page of the food chain Tiv Taam responded to a report on the Facebook page Concentration of Destroyers of Israel by saying that one of its employees, who had expressed happiness at the death of soldiers and Jews, had been fired.

Last week, the Lod municipality dismissed a psychological counsellor, Isra Gara of Jatt, after she expressed joy at the death of soldiers.

Shufer-Sol food chain reported on its own Facebook page that two employees had been summoned to a hearing before dismissal, due to reports the two had made what it deemed unacceptable comments, and warned that employees who did so would be fired.

The mobile phone company Cellcom also summoned an employee for clarifications following a number of reports about statements she had allegedly made.

Ben-Gurion University President Prof. Rivka Carmi wrote to students and staff that the university was following the discourse on the Web, and if need be would act according to the disciplinary code. Tel Aviv University also warned in a letter to faculty against hurtful and extremist statements by students or faculty. Thirty faculty members signed a letter of protest against the move. 




 The media's the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power. Because they control the minds of the masses.

 Hanzi, you fucker ! 

I knew exactly who you are.

I heard you on O A a while ago, I don't listen to Howard anymore on account of him sucking a fat one for a long time. I do however have an interesting theory to run past you. It's my Sirius/XM conspiracy. I'm sure you heard about Anthony Cumia getting the axe ? 

Well my theory for the reason Antony got fired is because he is the single loudest, most influential, pro-gun personality on Sirius/XM. On the other end of the spectrum you have a hypocrite like Howard Stern who is anti-gun but has a permit to carry in NYC, which is incredibly hard to acquire. If you call him on it he'll tell you:

"But I'm a celebrity, I need one to ensure my safety, you know cause I'm so famous. Ho hoo." 

Basically he's saying he can carry a gun because his safety is so vital to the community whereas us plebeians don't deserve them because we are the poor unwashed masses, our lives don't have as much inherent value as old Howard from the Hamptons. 

BTW: I admire your attempt at getting through to Opie and Anthony, but they're hopeless and Jim Norton too. They are conservative guys and they can't hear anything that would upset their worldview and America's role in it as a beacon of freedom or soaring eagle or something else they can get a freedom boner to. It made for good radio though.  




 I get that a lot of people are going to see this submission and think to themselves:

"He's a shock jock, who cares what the hell he thinks ?"

Stern has the most heard voice in the Western hemisphere, his own radio show opening theme song boasts about reaching more than 10 million listeners a day. He's in people's cars, in their headphones, he has an intimate relationship with his fans, in short he wields a tremendous amount of influence. Imagine if Jimmy Fallon went on the Tonight Show and went on a rant like Stern did about Israel, it would without question sway public opinion in favor of Israel.

 I'm aware you have to answer 2 questions to be able to view this article but its a good article and I think its worth the 30 seconds it'll take you to answer the couple of questions and get to see the article. It does a good job illustrating Israel's inherent advantage in the social media battle.  




 FTA:

"As The Jerusalem Post reports, the effort to make Israels case is being spearheaded by 400 college students posting comments, memes, video clips, images and explanatory graphics on Facebook and Twitter from dozens of computers in a Hasbara war room at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. Hasbara, a Hebrew euphemism for propaganda, literally means explanation, and the organizers of the campaign promise to equip like-minded volunteers who visit their website, Israel Under Fire, with everything you need in order to properly inform about and advocate for Israel, in 19 languages." 




 I was also banned for a week as well, perfect, I'll be unbanned as soon as Israel finishes inflicting collective punishment on the entirety of Gaza and its prisoners. How convenient.  




 Cue the Israel apologists saying :

"Who cares what a celebrity thinks."

Or:

"Really so we're getting our international political advice from pop stars now ? "

The story isn't that she may or may not support Palestine, the story is that whatever forces are at work in Hollywood do not want celebrities to speak their minds on a perceived injustice. It amounts to blatant censorship and for better or worst, most of the time worst, society gets its social cues from celebrities and in this instance people like Rihanna and Dwight Howard from the Houston Rockets are not being allowed to air their grievances.

Basically they wouldn't even allow this article to gain any upvotes or traction from the r/politics community before removing it.  




 This was literally the worst podcast I've ever heard. This guy is just an academic who sits back and talks shit about Muslims the whole time. Whoever heard of a Jewish guy complaining about Palestinians, so brave. This guy is a piece of shit shit, sitting there defending Netanyahu and his apartheid state in Israel. 

Hey Guy Saad, since you can't seem to figure out why the Palestinians are so incensed by the here's a little fucking cheat sheet for you. Maybe the reason the Palestinians have a grudge with you guys is because you took their land, forced them to live in hellish, permanently temporary refugee dwellings, leaving them perpetually stateless. 700,000 Palestinians were forced out in 1948 alone. 

Then he blames Muslims for all of the instability in the Middle East which is especially egregious because ever since Israel, the country Mr. Saad is unabashedly above criticism, was created in 1948, they have been the most disruptive force in the Middle East.

 "01.Jul.2014 | SCGSCG "

That article is from yesterday. So yes, I'm almost 24 hours behind you. Sorry /s.  




 "Comments for this thread are now closed." 

Top Comment: 

"So what, 30+ people were shot and several killed over the weekend in Chicago. We care about Israel why?"

I wonder how long they tried to downvote that comment off the top of the thread before they decided to shut it down and move onto another platform to present their propaganda. 




 No I just stumbled across it organically when I googled, "Reddit vote", looking for articles about the rule change, I actually didn't click on that link but it's nice to see we are thinking alike. BTW, I was the mod who proposed stickying your submission. This entire situation is completely fucked. I spent 18 months religiously Redditing, just to have the rug pulled out from under me. How am I, a user of a sub that is regularly vote brigaded, expected to not suspect the worst after such a sudden loss of transparency ?  




 I could recommend stickying a banner across the top of r/conspiracy about this recent upvote/downvote visibility change just to get r/redditlution, kudos on the name by the way, a little bit of traction and new subscribers. I'll run it past the other mods on r/conspiracy and see what they think about it.  




 Wow, this post sure has a lot of comments, I'd love to see how many upvote/downvotes it has overall, now if only there was a way to do that ...  




 Congratulations admins, you've irreparably damaged Reddit. I spend the majority of my time on small subs, and those subs are now completely open to being vote brigaded. I don't understand why in a million years the admins would take it upon themselves to make a change no one asked for that in fact makes vote brigading impossible to detect. Of course I do actually know why the admins did it, and it probably has something to do with this article from the Guardian that was published yesterday about Reddit making digital marketing campaigns easier for corporations, here's the link to it:

http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jun/18/integrate-reddit-digital-marketing

It's so blatantly obvious that this is a move to make Reddit more mainstream and corporate-friendly. This simple fact is this will kill the smaller subs, like r/guns, r/progressive, r/worldpolitics, r/conspiracy, r/documentaries and countless other subs. This is completely fucked, I can't even look at vote counts for my old posts from well before the implementation of this ridiculous rule. Reddit just opted for less transparency, to whose benefit ? Cause it's certainly for the users benefit, cui bono, Reddit, it's Latin for who benefits and that is the question we should be asking ourselves, who benefits from this ridiculous new rule. It's the government and corporations that benefit from this, Reddit is nothing more than a hollowed out shell of its old self, a PR agency that touts itself as the Front Page of the Internet, a bastion of democracy when in fact it just does PR for governments and corporations, a task they just got a lot better at. It's open season on every small, controversial sub, in terms of vote brigading, courtesy of the administrators.  




 I heard about that kid, when you hear stories like this you can't help but notice the hypocrisy of America commenting on the criminal justice system in Russia or the Middle East. Considering they are literally doling out life sentences for cannabis baked goods here in the land of the free. I would take some whips on the back over a life sentence any day. 




 Just as a point of reference, a few months ago a friend of mine got caught smoking weed while driving home. He got hit with a 3rd tier DUI because apparently marijuana is the most intoxicating substance on Earth and immediately warrants the highest tier DUI. He got sentenced to 90 days in jail and an 18 month license suspension. He's getting out in a little over 2 months, gotta love those mandatory minimum sentences. I'm outraged and completely unsurprised by the fact that there is no mandatory minimum for child molestation of all things. Additionally, I'd be shocked if this child rapist serves the entirety of his 120 day sentence.  




 This 14 minute old post has 11 upvotes   9 downvotes. Vote-brigade much ?

 So what's strange about this is that Michael Ruppert has done Joe Rogan's podcast twice and the last time he appeared on there was in May of 2012 and he was as positive as I've ever heard him sound. The 1st time he did Rogan's podcast he was all doom and gloom, now granted this was almost 2 years ago that he was in good spirits and that is a long time, but that's the last I heard from him. I know he did that 6-part series for Vice called Apocalypse man, but I haven't seen that yet. Here's the link for the last Rogan podcast he did in May 2012:

 The shooting also took place mere hours after a very controversial decision by the Supreme Court to remove campaign finance limits in the horrendous McCutcheon v. FEC ruling; subsequently knocking it off the front page.  




 I had to articles removed as well, the justification was that it had already been covered by other articles, when I pointed that the story was no where to be seen on the front page of r/worldnews, m/SaraLee pointed out that they allowed to articles about to remain on r/worldnews. Both had been heavily downvote brigaded and as a result had just 6   3 upvotes a few hours after being posted. It's a damn shame, this is a pretty damning story for the US government.

I've posted a lot of things about the NSA but have never had a post flagged like this, what gives ?  




 This is so enraging, the Palestinian people have done nothing to deserve this. 

They had to give up their country because of Germany's actions during WW2, I don't understand how it makes any fucking sense whatsoever. 

The Jewish settlers have no interest in living alongside a Palestinian state and are chipping away at the notion of 1 through these illegal land grabs. 

The cognitive dissonance in Israel apologists is so strong its amazing.

It happened on Saturday. 

"Israeli troops killed three Palestinians in an early morning raid that was followed by a clash with angry protesters in a West Bank town on Saturday, the military and Palestinian security officials said, in the deadliest incident in months."  




 The Post was recently purchased by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. I'm not saying he is any more trustworthy than Rupert Murdoch, but it did get a fair amount of press coverage late last year I believe.  




 That was some straight up serial killer shit. 

No other way about it, it was murder, as plain as day. The guy was getting on the ground and everything and the 1 cop just unloaded on him for seemingly no reason.

Then his legs just barely twitched and they plugged him with 3 more rounds for it, simply disturbing.  




 Thank you.  




 I would be willing to do it. 

Also had I known that I would 1 day be throwing my name in as a contender for moderatorship of this, the sub that I created my Reddit account for, r/conspiracy, I would've spent more time coming up with a clever/incendiary username, but here we are. 

Here is a montage of my greatest hits on r/conspiracy :

Now, because this a democratic system I plan on using some good old fashioned fascism and fear-mongering to rile up the free thinkers to get them in a frenzy and sweep into the cabal of power   influence that is moderator status on r/conspiracy /s. 

This sub is under attack, the content on this sub has taken a nose dive over the last 6 months and that decline in quality conspiracy-related content has been in direct correlation with the spike in subscribers to r/conspiracy. How is it that around the same time the Snowden leaks began this sub saw a sharp increase in traffic of the shill variety ? Could it be coincidence ? I don't think so, and in IMHO most of you would agree with me. This sub has clearly been hijacked by r/conspiratard and their merry band of vote brigadiers. To defend this sub I would :

Greatly reduce the amount of memes that get submitted to this sub, the memes that make it to the top of the page here over the past 6 months have at times been either what I would consider to be circlejerk material or it's been things that have been entirely antithetical to what this sub is supposed to be about, like the link I've provided as an example. (http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1yzx2k/alan_moore/) 

I would also investigate/ban all suspected shills immediately after viewing their inane comment/submission. No one understands the frustration of witnessing your controversial yet somehow popular submission to r/conspiracy have it's comment section derailed by an endless cadre of suspected shills and their stupid jokes, like I do. 

If made moderator I would respond to any queries regarding the sub or my actions as moderator in a timely fashion, I've dealt with mods that are quick at removing your post and then slow at explaining why it was taken down, it can be frustrating. Over the course of an average day I am on Reddit on my work computer   personal laptop as well as being on the Reddit is Fun app on my smartphone   tablet while I'm out.

Thanks for reading all of this/considering giving me your vote.  




 48 minute post has 43 upvotes and 25 downvotes. That sure is an usually high amount of downvotes in a short period of time. This would be funny if it wasn't such a blatant example of organized vote brigading.

  Bipolarbear0 is without a doubt the biggest piece of shit I have ever encountered on the Internet, and I've been online since '96. I can't prove it but I'm certain he's the reason I got banned from r/news.  I complained about him removing all of my posts from r/news to the mods of r/news and the next time I posted an article to r/news (it was about the amount of attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians had increased 4-fold in 2013) I was promptly banned for posting opinion/analysis pieces. This cannot go on,  my ban was supposed to be for 1 month, 5 weeks later I was told that only the mod that banned me can unban me and the mods of r/news will mot reveal which specific mod it was, but I mean come on.  I couldn't post an article critical of Israel to r/news without it being removed for some reason or another. 









































































































































































 I agree, that's one of the most succinct quotes I've heard about the Palestine-Israel quagmire in a long time.

 You know what, I agree with you, and I'm going to take this article down. Thank you for calling it out, cause I was sitting on the fence about submitting it.  




 Google "gerrymandering ".   




 I absolutely agree, why would you want to get rid of someone that racially ambiguous, she could pull off several different races, thereby doing a wide range of good impersonations.  




 "If we're going to look at suspects [for 9/11], we should look to the groups that benefit the most from these kinds of incidents, and I think we should put the state of Israel on the suspect list because I think this diverts attention from what's happening in the Palestinian territories so that they can go on with their aggression and occupation and apartheid policies," he said in a radio interview shortly after the attacks in 2001, according to the Los Angeles Times.  




 All of Patrice O'neal's conspiracy videos on YouTube are must see if you subscribe to this sub. They are from some of Patrice's appearances on the Opie and Anthony Show a few years ago. 

Patrice does a really good job breaking down the stigma of being a  conspiracy theorist and makes you laugh while he does it.  




 This is an excellent self.post.  




 Okay, while I agree with the sentiment of the submission and am not a Zionist apologist whatsoever, I think its wildly irresponsible; not to mention very misleading to make up fake quotes. 

I know Elizabeth Warren came out in support of Israel during the Operation Protective Edge last summer, I was very disappointed when that happened, I felt it exposed Elizabeth Warren as just another Zionist. 

However, she never said these words, and this meme submission is circlejerky to say the least. Find me a reputable source of her saying this and I'll retract my statement, until then I'm calling bullshit.

You can't just go around making up fake quotes for people you dislike or disagree with on global issues. If that were the case I could just put up a picture of Netanyahu saying how he'd like to wipe out all of the Palestinians and drink the blood of their children. 

Do you honestly think that a savvy, liberal politician like Warren is going to give such a ham handed, blunt statement like that ?  




 They changed the title of the article after putting it up. When I submitted it to /r/politics this was the title.  




 What the ACTUAL fuck !  




 Arizona ? 

This article is about events taking place in New Mexico.  




 That's an excellent book. I consider it required reading for anyone who frequents this subreddit.  




 I posted this in /r/movies and it got downvoted to 0 upvotes less than a minute after I posted it. A slew of what would appear to be stock negative comments followed. 

I think /r/movies has been compromised, I don't go there very often but I was disappointed to find out that even a subreddit about movies has been infiltrated by pro-military users. 

Here's the link to my submission on /r/movies if anyone wants to peruse the comments section:

 He couldn't make them any worst.  




 5 things he allegedly lied about in his book, of which he lost one in court. 

He defamed Jesse Ventura in his book and Ventura took him to court and won $1.8 million in a jury settlement, so thats a pretty ironclad, confirmed lie. 

Not for nothing, these weren't little white lies that the average person tells. This is a case of this guy writing a book about his life and lying in the book about his life and then selling the packaged lie to the American consumer, so its a little different.  




 Jesus Christ.  




 Any more racist generalizations about entire nations of people ? 

I bet you have some great opinions about black people, Asians and Latinos as well.  




 It whitewashes the fact that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, none of the hijackers were Iraqi, 15 of the 19 were Saudi Arabian, the US's second best ally in the region after Israel. 

I love it, Saudi's attack us, so lets deploy troops to Iraq, foolproof logic. Clint Eastwood linked Iraq to 9/11 with the way he set up that sequence in the film. Eastwood needs to stop making films, this film was a 2 hour celebration of jingoism and xenophobia. 

Did he at any point in the film have any of his characters say:

"Hey, why the fuck are we even here ? Weren't we attacked by Saudis ?"

No, he didn't.  




 Simple solution:

Don't enlist. 

Problem solved. 

At the very least don't enlist, go over there and wantonly commit atrocities just to come back and here throw your service in my face, I didn't ask you to enlist, so don't act like you did me a favor.

The worst thing returning veterans say to civilians that question the motives for the war they participated in is:

"I fought so that people like you could have freedom"

Or something childlike to that effect, completely oblivious to the fact that they are just mere pawns on some billionaire banker/industrialist's chessboard. The war in Iraq was NOT about defending our freedom, or about 9/11. It was about taking out a dictator whose policies no longer reflected the US's best interests. 

Saddam was going to start pricing his barrels of oil on the international market in Euros and not in dollars or petrodollars, which would've adversely effected the dollars status as the international reserve currency. That more than any other reason is why we went into Iraq. Don't delude yourself into thinking it was about protecting our freedom here at home. I certainly can't remember the last time an Iraqi tried to curtail my freedom, even the notion is ridiculous.  




 He's made into a tragic hero, a martyr, that's the absolute best possible thing to be. A tragic, misunderstood figure. 

They made him into a Christ-like saint who gave it all for his country. The film will without a doubt increase enlistment. [Besides Clint Eastwood is US veteran, do you think he would honestly make a film depicting the army or a marine in a negative light ?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood#Early_life)

Look at Clint's other military film, *Flags of our Fathers*, its unabashed positive depiction of the US military in Japan in World War II, it might as well be a recruitment film.  




 Really ?!

I think starting a war on what was later proven to be manufactured, phony evidence and bombing a country back to the stone age would make the United States the savages in that situation. 

The US left a power vacuum for religious strife to take place, they created a platform for it. Then you have people like Chris Kyle blaming the victims of war for getting sucked up in a power vacuum that he helped create. The idiocy and ignorance looms large in that mans worldview. 

Furthermore you have the US army engaging in brutal torture on Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison, setting dogs on them and electrocuting the prisoners genitalia to get perverse pleasure. That's pretty savage if you ask me. Good luck justifying the atrocities committed by the occupying US army in Iraq, you have your work cut out for you.  




 Yea but its 2015, we shouldn't treat people that are outwardly racist as the heroes of our society. 

All this movie does is encourage young Americans to enlist in the military and continue an unending war overseas. It simplistically displays the complex reasons we went to war in Iraq. 

For instance, in the film they show the events of 9/11 and in the very next scene 18 months later, Chris Kyle is miraculously in Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with 9/11. The film attempts to whitewash US history. 




 Here are some Chris Kyle quotes from his book *American Sniper*:

*Savage, despicable evil. That's what we were fighting in Iraq.* 
 Chris Kyle, *American Sniper*

*But I wondered, how would I feel about killing someone? Now I know. Its no big deal.* 
 Chris Kyle, *American Sniper: Memorial Edition*

*Savage, despicable evil. Thats what we were fighting in Iraq. Thats why a lot of people, myself included, called the enemy savages. There really was no other way to describe what we encountered there. People ask me all the time, How many people have you killed? My standard response is, Does the answer make me less, or more, of a man? The number is not important to me. I only wish I had killed more. Not for bragging rights, but because I believe the world is a better place without savages out there taking American lives. Everyone I shot in Iraq was trying to harm Americans or Iraqis loyal to the new government.* 
 Chris Kyle, *American Sniper*

This is the hero that the American people are lionizing and holding up so high. This movie is pure propaganda and I refuse to be anyone's useful idiot and support this jingoistic, xenophobic film. 

He referred to people protecting their homeland from an occupying army as savages, I guess that would make the founding fathers and the soldiers who fought in the American revolution savages too then, right ? Wait no, those people were white so they can't be savages, they were patriotic, red blooded Americans. What hypocritical bullshit, enjoy your Academy Award Bradley Cooper, you like, Ben Affleck, sold your soul for your Oscar with a propaganda film.  




 Did you see the recent report that said that the US has already spent 3 trillion in the global war on terror ? 

Who do you think that 3 trillion is owed to ? 

The bulk of it is owed to a slew of defense contractors. Who do you think makes the bombs, tanks, fighter jets, ammo rounds and body bags ? General Electric and their ilk. War is business and business is a booming. 

Do you know who General Smedley Butler is ? He is one of the most decorated General/marines in US military history. He wrote a book in 1933 called *War is a Racket*, in which he atones for his past sins in the US military and admits that it was all for the United Fruit Company, Brown Brothers banking house and a few other major corporations. Here is a link to War is a Racket on YouTube:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI3lckqaSk0

80 years later its still true that War is a Racket, now more than ever. Listen to what General Butler iterated 80 years ago.  




 The sad thing is you evidently can milk 9/11 for 14 years. All the while you can also bilk the tax payers out of trillions to hand over to Lockheed Martin, Halliburton, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. 

9/11 is a golden goose for defense conglomerates.  




 Goebbels was in favor of free speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If youre really in favor of free speech, then youre in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise. Otherwise, youre not in favor of free speech. 

 *Noam Chomsky* 




 I can't remember the last time a news story was so saturated with hypocrisy.  




 Max Blumenthal is the author of *Goliath*:*Life   Loathing in Greater Israel*. Anyone interested in the plight of the Palestinian people should seriously consider reading this book. As a Jewish person, Mr. Blumenthal is allowed to really critique the quagmire in the occupied territories without the fear of being labelled an anti-Semite. 

We should try to support his work, because he is really putting himself out there on the forefront of this debate with this book which I would consider to be his most important piece of writing. He gets called all types of things by the Zionist crowd, self-hating Jew, etc, etc. 

I think writers like him are the most important advocates for a Palestinian state, after all he grew up in a Jewish home and took the birthright trip to Israel so many young Jewish people take. He has an indispensable perspective on the situation in Israel and Palestine.  




 No, I'm not. I'm saying that when the options are Bush and Clinton that you don't have a real choice to make. You have the illusion of choice.
The wealthy megadonors have made your choice for you. Policy will not change with either of these 2 frontrunning candidates taking office. 

The only thing you'll see change is wedge issues, if Bush goes in you'll see abortion rights limited. If Hillary gets elected you'll see marriage equality advance. All of the truly substantive issues will remain the same, we won't leave Afghanistan, we won't end the war on drugs, we won't curtail the global war on terror, we won't do anything about the growing economic inequality and the death of the middle class, etc, etc ... 

In short, Bush and Hillary are 2 sides of the same coin.  




 Yea, its a Simpsons Halloween episode reference. A bit dated, but prescient nonetheless.  




 I think this will be a "don't blame me, I voted for Kodos", election. 




 So the programming begins. It was really important for them to use the adjective, bizarre, in their title. Clearly letting their readers know that this is their wacky news article for the week.  




 Rule #4 - No abusive/threatening language 




 *So brave* 




 Ad hominem attacks such as "antisemitic conspiratard" are the last refuge of people that have lost the debate and have to resort to labeling people they disagree with, with derisive tags as an alternative. 

So I'll go ahead and keep on illuminating people on the issue at hand and you can keep on attempting to assassinate my character and hope that people don't question your motive.  




 Look at /u/ShadowXWarrior and his account overview. This user moderates /r/IsraelandFriends 

Do you honestly think this user is any more impartial than I in this debate. 

Furthermore, isn't it a little strange to go and analyze my entire account history to find what you perceive to be offensive material ? What are the motivations of /u/ShadowxWarrior ? 

That isn't something that one does just on a whim out of some sort of sense of morality. This user is attempting to smear my character and I'm not standing for it. Why don't you address me directly on the points of this debate rather then attempting to engage in a smear campaign ? 

That is, if you think you can debate on the merits of the issue at hand, which is the continued oppression of the people of Palestine on their own land, at the hands of colonial settlers from Israel.  




 I have a lot of respect for Oliver Stone. A lot of people don't know that Stone's son, [Sean Stone, is a 9/11 Truther.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2387654/Sean-Stone-says-9-11-inside-job-Hezbollah-terrorists.html)

Aside from that Stone's documentary *South of the Border*, is required viewing for anyone interested in the United States involvement in creating coups in nations with democratically elected governments to result in regime change.  




 I love how TimesofIsrael is considered an impartial source of information regarding Israel. For some reason those articles are never considered opinion/analysis pieces.  




 I don't see what that has to do with anything, just by asking that question I can tell you are one of those Hindu nationalists, to whom Modi can do no wrong. 

I am a Sikh. I don't allow my religion to define my worldview. It would appear that you do. That must be a very boring, programmed existence for you, to have your mind made up for you on all the important issues. 

This is you:

"I'm Hindu ! I hate all Muslims ! Go Modi !"

I bet you're a real critical thinker /s.  




 They also haven't passed a resolution condemning India for warring with Pakistan in the Kashmir region. 

If Palestinians who are Muslim, haven't condemned India for the actions taken by India against Pakistan in Kashmir isn't that enough ? 

The fact that India is not a Muslim nation and they still haven't drawn any ire from Palestine, a Muslim nation on the Kashmir quagmire, is evidence enough of their appreciation of India.

Furthermore, what can Palestine do for India when they have Israel breathing down their neck, constantly encroaching on their own land and reducing life in Gaza to an open-air prison. If India would stay the course I'm certain the people of Palestine would reciprocate India's many good deeds if only they could. 

Israeli's are violating a slew of international agreements and UN mandates when they continue to violate Palestinian's human rights in the future Palestinian state. The parallels between what Palestinians are going through now and what Indians were going through under the British Raj are endless. 

Palestine first needs to be in a situation where they can pass some sort of mandate that would be substantive on the Kashmir quagmire. Right now, they are just getting by, surviving on what subsistence Israel allows them. In these troubled times for the Palestinian state, they are using their religion as a pillar to strengthen their resolve. Much like Gandhi and Bhagat Singh did in the face of British oppression. 

They shouldn't be punished for being Muslims, like many of the other Indians on this thread would like to do. The Palestinians are the unabashed victims in this situation and India is flip-flopping on their proud humanitarian history and turning their backs on the colonized to appease the powerful the Western countries (US   UK) that would like nothing more than to see Israel take over all of Palestine. That is what Modi's vision for India is, an appeaser of Western imperialism.  




 No, one Muslim nation, Palestine, is being colonized by Europeans. 

How is it that Indians, the poster children for colonized people can't empathize with people being colonized by Europeans. Its as if the British Raj didn't exist, how soon we forget the horrors of European colonialism when its Muslims being colonized. 

India was once a great example of a burgeoning power that cared about humanitarianism. Now under Modi, we just do what America and England tell us to do, and turn our back on other people that are being colonized my Europeans. This change in policy is rife with hypocrisy.  




 Seeing as how you can't continue with this debate without resorting to absurdities (aliens) I'm through with this back and forth. Its called intelligent discourse, its what adults do, you should try it some time.  




 The religious extremists will support Pakistan, Palestine's government however would support India seeing as how India has close diplomatic ties with India. Furthermore, India was the first non-Arabic country to recognize the PLO. Manmohan Singh also saw to it that India opened up a visa office in Ramallah just last year. 

I don't think you know what you are talking about. [Here's the link to the Wikipedia page detailing India-Palestine relations.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Palestine_relations)

India was once a shining beacon for shaming the rampant colonialism taking place in Palestine and the occupied territories. Modi is ruining that great legacy of humanitarianism. He's turning India into a vassal state of the West, rubber stamping their colonialism at the UN. India might as well just turn over its UN vote to England, with Modi in charge. England and America are calling the shots for Modi, he is their puppet.  




 Good response, I didn't know I was exchanging comments on geopolitics with a 12 year old.  




 No its Modi kowtowing to the West. He is placating the West at every turn and selling out India's sovereignty. No other country in the world was screwed over as much as India because of Western colonialism and now Modi is rubber stamping the exploitation of the Palestinian people just 67 years after India gained their independence from Western hegemony. 

Modi is turning India into a puppet state for the West. India has sovereignty, so they should act like it. Indians would do well to remind themselves that the kind of rationale they're applying to make excuses for Israel is the same kind of reasoning that allowed Britons to ease their conscience about the rape and pillage of India during British colonization.  




 Well just remember that those white people that you're siding with now referred to Indians seeking independence as extremists just 70 years ago. Its a tad bit hypocritical to refer to people that are being colonized now by European colonists as extremists. I guess with that rationale someone like Bhagat Singh was an extremist as well.  




 Yes I was born in India and spent my formative years there. So that apology ...  




 I'm Indian, so good luck with that one.  




 Oh my god ! They almost don't have complete compliance from Congress. The horror ! 

Israel and their continued collective oppression of the Palestinian people on their ancestral land seems to be the only thing that Congress can agree on funding. God forbid we let Israel practice apartheid in the occupied territories of Palestine on their own shekel.

 Well we do pride ourselves here on being one of the last places on Reddit where things don't get censored and almost anything is allowed to get posted and gets a fair chance of getting upvoted. 

What I can do, as ineffective as it may seem on its face is propose moving no memes up the rule list a few slots, thereby stressing its importance. Right now its the 8th rule of /r/conspiracy but I don't see why it can't be higher up.  




 We try not to remove anything once it reaches the top of the page, even memes. It leads to cries of censorship. Also content control is a slippery slope. 

I don't like seeing memes at the top of the page either, they never provide any new content and usually tend to lend themselves to circlejerking. 

The key is to get to memes before they fly up the page and accumulate hundreds of upvotes in a matter of an hour or two. 

If I see a good self post, I'll always suggest stickying it to other mods. Our sidebar picture right now links to a great self post by a user about trolls. 

If you submit a really good self post that you put a lot of time into and is of good quality, message the mods about it so it doesn't fall by the wayside. We'll always consider stickying a good self post.  




 Racial slurs will not be tolerated. Continued usage of racial slurs will result in a ban.  




 I meant how are they going to justify it to the user when they inquire how it falls under the category of politics, as in right vs. left, blue team vs. red team. In other words, its not explicitly political, only vaguely political.  




 These removals from /r/TIL seem to be getting more and more brazen. Good catch on the removal this submission is about, I wonder how they're going to justify this one ?

 That all the countries that don't have central banks with Western controlled central bankers running things, happen to be the same exact countries that the United States and NATO seem to have problems with. I'm sure that doesn't have anything to do with the fact that these countries want to control their own natural resources and the currency that values them. 

Just look at the countries the United States is currently beefing with, its the ones that aren't in debt to Anglo-American bankers, like Syria, Iran, North Korea. You can take Iraq and Libya off of that increasingly short list of truly sovereign nations.  




 That the vast majority of the mass media, be it mainstream news, magazines, radio stations, major Hollywood film studios, and television networks are owned predominantly by one group of people. There's no way that happens without some sort of collusion on some level.

On its face, this 3 and 1/2 hour documentary may seem like a daunting task, but its one of the most rewarding documentaries you will ever see. It answers a slew of elusive questions and portrays the Rothschilds in a realistic manner, sourcing the family's meteoric rise to rule the world of finance.

 Answers to leading questions under torture naturally tell us nothing about the beliefs of the accused; but they are good evidence for the beliefs of the accusers. 

 C.S. Lewis, *The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature* 




 I don't think they shove them down people's throats like they do here in America. I'm Indian, and the police in India don't have a slew of television shows and number one films made about them. As a matter of fact, the police in India are pretty much reviled, everyone is always going on about how hopelessly corrupt they are. 

I think the dozen new cop shows every fall is an explicitly American phenomenon. There's a difference between having novels about a detective, in Sherlock Holmes, and being inundated with procedural cop shows on television.  




 I wish there was a way for Congress to make accurately reporting how many people they kill a precondition for the police to be able to receive military equipment from the federal government. 

That would definitely force police departments to accurately report these figures. Otherwise they would lose the new found tools of oppression and instruments of death that they love to parade around on and with.  




 I always tell people this. The first step to curtailing the police state is to stop watching shows like Law   Order, 24 and NCIS. We have to lower the prestige of the police state in America. 

Literally the biggest hit comedy film this past summer was 22 Jump Street. That's not some mistake. Its not an accident that 'cop shows' are a genre in and of themselves in American television and film. We are programmed to always give the police the benefit of the doubt in any situation.  




 I can't think of anything that would have a greater likelihood of creating extremists.  




 No, I never got a chance to. My entire /r/documentaries career lasted about a month. I didn't know The Greatest Story Never Told existed before I was banned. If I wasn't banned from that sub that would be the first thing I'd do there. 

Someone should try, I'm certain they'd find a reason to remove it, but its still worth a shot. 




 I posted this in the comments section of the other submission about /r/documentaries and Monsanto so I'll just copy and paste it here:

I've had bad experiences with the mod team over at /r/documentaries.

For a few weeks I posted great documentaries there that regularly made it to the top of the page. I posted a documentary about Monsanto and it made it to the top of the page and the comments section got wiped out. The shills lost the PR battle in the comments section so the mods took it upon themselves to remove all of the comments.

The straw that broke the camels back was when I posted a documentary about Israel and Zionism and Palestine. It was removed and when I inquired to the mod team I was accused of having an agenda and attempting to use /r/documentaries as my personal soap box. When I countered by sayng that their censorship of my documentary was evidence of the mods of /r/documentaries having an agenda, I was banned. I never did attempt to appeal my ban. Why ? Cause fuck them that's why. /r/Documentaries is discredited in my eyes. You can post as many documentaries there as you want about Isis or Al-Qaeda, but not Israel. It upsets the narrative to much I suppose.

 This edition of Red Ice Radio is all about this topic, its called, ["Hate Propaganda" Legislation in Canada.](http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2014/11/RIR-141112.php) It goes into great detail how the Zionist lobby in Canada is limiting on speech on anything with respect to Israel or Zionism. Its pretty despicable.

 Yea, I linked to the wrong article. I'll resubmit with the correct URL later on. Thanks for the heads up, I appreciate it.  




 For anyone wondering, the submission was removed for being "Off Topic" despite the fact that it deals explicitly with US politics. Certain mods over at /r/politics displayed stunning judgement when they said that this submission somehow had to do with Israeli politics. 

I even messaged them selected paragraphs from the article that demonstrated how this article dealt specifically with US politics and the IAC (Israeli American Committee) which is basically another AIPAC, and they still said that the article was "Off Topic". 

Pretty poor judgement, something tells me they didn't even read the parts of the article that I messaged them. They had their minds made up, regardless of what was in the article.  




 Lupe Fiasco is my favorite rapper, his lyrical content and subject matter are unmatched by any other rapper or mainstream artist that are his contemporaries. 

His content is so good that it actually makes me feel embarrassed for liking rappers like Jay-Z when I was younger. Couple that with the fact that he has come out for 9/11 truth in a mainstream single and he is simply one of my favorite people, rapper or otherwise, period.  




 "Some people are the greatest people on Earth with good hearts and will get in the studio and make the most negative music in the world for the sake of success. That's what the music business does to you. That's what capitalism does to you."

 Its called planned obsolescence and its a scourge upon the planet. 

How else are the titans of capitalism supposed to fuel their infinite growth paradigm on a finite planet ? Fleece the masses and make the biosphere in the developing and third world pay the price. E-waste is the fastest growing type of waste on Earth and something has to be done about it before it begins polluting the ocean and becomes the new plastic.  




 I think that's a great idea, and thank you for taking a genuine interest in the state of the sub. Users like you keep this place interesting, don't let the shills get you down. 

I know what its like to have yourself invested in your own self-post. You feel like those are your words, thoughts and iterations that are being ridiculed by a seemingly endless cadre of shills, trolls and conspiratards. Try to look at it this way, your iterations are provoking this response from these shills because they don't want the users here to be emboldened enough to submit their own original content to this sub. They don't want this place to be one that is friendly to original thoughts, they want you to be scared of criticism. 

In short, they don't want anyone here to get enough confidence in themselves by way of positive feedback from the /r/conspiracy community because then they might have another James Corbett on their hands to worry about.  




 Okay, the Russ Baker AMA is going to be up for a few more days for visibility, this Sunday evening when that AMA has run its course I will put this submission before the rest of the mod team for stickying. If you log into Reddit on Sunday night or Monday morning and this submission is stickied atop the front page, you'll know who to thank. 

I think that self posts about visiting the new page should be stickied every 2-3 months just to remind /r/conspiracy users how important it is that the new submissions page not be manipulated in any way.  




 Content control is a slippery slope, I see plenty of things that I would like to remove, but that would lead to inevitable cries of censorship. What we like to do is let the users decide what should make it to the top of the page. If you want to do a good write up/self-post encouraging more users to visit the new submissions page then I would definitely present it to the other mods for a sticky nomination. I think you make several valid points here. 

If I had my way I would remove the majority of UFO/ancient alien submissions made to the sub, but I can't do that without alienating some of our userbase or being accused of being some sort of malicious government censorship agent, when in reality I just find UFO conspiracies to be childish and amateur. As a matter of fact I would even go as far as saying that some of those UFO video submissions are submitted here by the conspiratard crowd and brigaded to the top of the page to make us seem like a less serious sub, of course I have no way of proving that. 

But I digress, write up a good self post encouraging users to visit the new page more often and I'll nominate it to be stickied atop the page for a few days and if its agreed upon your sticky will go up and you'll see the quality of the front page go up drastically. That way front page submissions are better and the mods won't hear cries of censorship either.  




 [The new Pentagon defense budget for 2015 actually includes an additional $351 million for upgrades to the Israeli Iron Dome defense system, so I don't think this is even something anyone in the administration is even mulling.](http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/12/04/3599827/defense-bill/) 

The FreeBeacon is a conservative news outlet, so they'll take any criticism of Israel by the administration and make it out to be much larger than it is. How could the US sanction Israel while giving $3 plus billion in aid ? If the US really wanted to damage Israel they would just cut off some of the exorbitant foreign aid Israel gets, there would be no need to go through the UN to sanction them.  




 "Rambler felt things got off to an unfortunate, if familiar, start when he learned that the **House and Senate Armed Services Committee had decided to use the lame-duck session of Congress and the National Defense Authorization Act to give 2,400 acres of the Tonto National Forest in Arizona to a subsidiary of the Australian-English mining giant Rio Tinto.**"

The song remains the same, how is this any different then colonial settlers claiming manifest destiny to push Native American tribes off their land in the 19th century ? Except instead of manifest destiny, they have modern day legalese to back up their claim to the land. The end result however is the same, Native Americans being pushed off their land so someone else can profit off of natural resources that rightfully belong to the Natives.  




 They tend to do a lot of Islamic terrorist fear mongering, that is my only real gripe with them. They recently released a documentary called "Inside ISIS" or something to that effect, that was all about how bad ISIS is and how someone has to do something about it.  




 I visited that walking dead wikipedia page that another user linked to, and apparently I also downplayed his body count in Woodbury as well. You should just visit that wikia page, they did a better job than I did. The killing of the butchers was a good one, and I'm surprised I missed it, that whole episode was a bloodbath.  




 True enough. I like choppy choppy BTW, its a nice way of putting a gruesome ending for Gareth.  




 Norman Reedus is a terrific actor. I don't think any other actor on the show has had their character allowed to flourish as much as Norman Reedus's depiction of Darryl Dixon. 

In the first 2 seasons you only got to see angry Darryl or impatient Darryl, of course in season 3 his brother Merle's passing let you see angry/sad Darryl. In this past episode you could see that he was inconsolable. I would like to think that what got him is that an innocent, young life was cut down so suddenly right in front of his eyes.  




 Chronological order:

1. 2 guys in the Nebraska episode in Season 2

2. Shane in Season 2

3. Tomas at the prison in Season 3

4. A few (approximately 2 I think) of the governors people in Woodbury in Season 3 

5. Rick killed that member of the marauders in the house that he, Michonne and "Coral" were staying at, in the bathroom upstairs in Season 4.

6. At the end of Season 4 Rick killed the guy who tried to rape "Coral" and the guy he bit, so that one was a twofer. 

7. Rick began Season 5 putting up some numbers, he killed according to my estimations 4 people during the great escape from Terminus, remember he sneaked up behind them with an automatic rifle and took out their legs, leaving them to be killed by nearby walkers. 

8. Then Rick killed Gareth in the church because he made him a promise, and what good is a man who can't keep his word ? 

9. And of course this past episode started with a bang with Rick taking out that cop who wouldn't listen to him. 

So according to my estimations, that makes a grand total of 15 people that Rick has turned into walkers.  




 This movie is a must see for anyone interested in the history of paper money, the Rothschilds, currency in America   Europe and the effects of these things on political and military history over the last 3 centuries. 

This movie has received several nominations for our documentary of the month in the past, but for whatever reason has always come up just short.  




 More power to these women for fighting back against these animals. When Indian men act like this it should be the responsibility of other Indian men to stand up and crack them in their fucking jaws. 

These Indian "men" do a disservice to all other Indian men around the globe when they act like animals and prey upon young women. It doesn't make Indians around the world look good when their countrymen are behaving like ravenous rapists and molesters. 

It also screws with tourism in India, which as everyone here knows is a sizable chunk of the economy. You can't blame people from the West for not wanting to go India  on holiday if they are going to be concerned about the safety of the women accompanying them on the trip the whole time. 

The other people on the bus also didn't do anything, they just stood by and let it happen. If I was there those dudes would've each gotten a right hand to the jaw.  




 Well it sounds like Ross just discovered their new advertising slogan to me:

"I gotta go to Ross right now homie !" 




 SHOW SPOILER: 

Best, most underrated villain the show has ever had. Its a shame he was killed off so quickly, although I suppose Rick did make him a promise.  




 I don't know what that would accomplish. 

I take it that you are not going to remove the submission and thereby are encouraging your users to engage in vote manipulation. If that is the case then just say so, and I'll be on my merry way.

BTW your own sidebar ends with "Furthermore thou shalt not brigade."

Way to selectively enforce your own rules. 




 Its the intention, if you make it an np submission then you are suggesting the users of your subreddit not participate in the submission over on /r/conspiracy. 

Simply submitting it to /r/undelete is a clear signal and invitation to your users to go ahead and brigade the thread. If anything, marking it [META] does nothing.  




 Shouldn't this be a non-participation submission to avoid vote brigading ? 

This submission is still on the front page of /r/conspiracy. Flairing it META does nothing to avoid vote brigading. /r/Conspiracy even changed their sidebar picture to one that is about this very submission. Its highly misleading to have it posted here like this as it suggests that the mods of /r/conspiracy (myself included) removed the submission in an act of overt censorship.  




 They flaired it META as somewhat of an indication that it is not in fact deleted but its still highly misleading that its posted there in the first place, I hate when they do that. Honest mistake.  




 Its not deleted, what are you talking about ?

This store owner is an Indian immigrant, he came here with nothing and tried to make something of himself. He doesn't have a dog in this fight, why are these rioters attempting to destroy his livelihood ? These convenience store owners don't even make that much money in the first place. My friends dad owns a convenience store just like this one and he's not exactly raking in the dough, this store owner probably makes most of his money from selling lottery tickets and tobacco products, just like the Swisher Sweets Michael Brown strong arm robbed from this very store.  So first he gets robbed by Michael Brown, then rioters and looters attempt to upend the way that he provides for his family in a vain attempt of misguided and misdirected anger. Their solution for police brutality is to rob someone who came here from a very poor country to earn a living, good job protesters /s.

 Season 2 was by far the worst season. You can make a case for character development, but I thought the writing for said character development was ham-handed at best. 

IMHO, season 5 is the best season, even though its only 7 episodes in, the action   acting in just the first 3 episodes made it better than season 2 in its entirety.

 They have effectively socialized losses through taxpayer funded bank bailouts and kept the gains, which have never been larger, privatized.

 I hate to do this, but can you delete this submission and repost it with no at the beginning, for non participation, lest the sub get accused of vote brigading.

They ripped off his "Web Redemption" which is what really angered Tosh. He spent a full minute acknowledging the fact that he doesn't own the funny clip tv show format. Its the fact that the hack from ESPN did what amounted to a Web Redemption on ESPN and even used Tosh's phrase word-for-word with the Web Redemption guest:

"Are you ready to give it another shot ?" 

To say that the guy from ESPN didn't rip off the Web Redemption would be pretty inaccurate.

 This is what happens when you regularly appoint heads of the FCC that previously worked for telecom giants. You think Tom Wheeler cares more about what President Obama or his former employer Verizon, an affiliation which absolutely got him the job as head of the FCC ?

The appointments of a former head of Verizon and a former VP of Monsanto to head the FCC   FDA by the Obama administration is a perfect example of this President allowing the foxes to guard the hen house. 




 Of course he is. 

2 weeks ago Jon Stewart spent the entire first segment of the Daily Show, making fun of the fact that Charlie Crist put a fan under his podium during the debate and that Florida Governor Rick Scott wouldn't debate him while the fan was there. This led to a 10 minute segment about dick jokes featuring the map of Florida.

John Oliver on the other hand will spend 15 minutes on one ACTUAL topic, and thoroughly discuss it, presenting both sides of the debate, as irrational as one side of the debate may be. Jon Stewart's bit is hackneyed and with Stephen Colbert leaving to host the Late Show next year, the path is clear for John Oliver to take over as the best current events/political comedy show on television.  




 There was also record low voter turnout this year. We haven't had voter turnout this low since World War II. You can't complain about kicking all the bums out and simultaneously sit at home on election day. 

The underlying issue is that access to voting in America is not easily accessible. You have to increase the hours of voting, and place more polling stations in higher population density, low-income, urban neighborhoods to truly address the issue. I'll cite a purely anecdotal example, myself, I leave work at 5:30 and then have to take a train   a bus home, leaving me just 45 minutes to vote after I get home. I got it done, but I imagine if I had to wait in line, instead of simply walking into my suburban polling station.  




 Its cause us Americans are so fat.

 What I'd like to know is why Matt Taibbi *really* left Glen Greenwald's *The Intercept*. Back when I had more faith in Greenwald, I was initially excited to see that Taibbi had joined them as well. Then all of a sudden he dropped out from the fledgling news magazine last week, without writing one article. I wonder what happened behind the scenes between Taibbi   Greenwald ?  




 Why not just sentence them to death at this point ?

 We find that Israeli attacks are more likely to occur prior to days with very high news pressure driven by clearly predictable events, they found.

 I smoke two joints in the morning

I smoke two joint at night

I smoke two joint in the afternoon

It makes me feel all right


I smoke two joints in time of peace

And two in time of war

I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints,

And then I smoke two more

 They wrote in the old days that it is sweet and fitting to die for one's country. But in modern war, there is nothing sweet nor fitting in your dying. You will die like a dog for no good reason.

 [It was called AIPAC: The Israeli Lobby] (http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/aipac-the-israeli-lobby/), and it was a great documentary. 




 They will ban you and then accuse you of having an agenda. 

I got banned there for questioning why the mods removed my documentary critical of the Israel Lobby. The mods reactionary response was to accuse me of having a malicious agenda. When I responded by saying that their censorship of my submission was the implementation of an agenda on their part I was banned instantly. I tried appealing but with little success. It seems like they have a narrative there that they don't wish to see disproved and that agenda would appear to be:

Arabs = the Terrorists 

Israeli's = the Victims of Arab Terrorism  
























 ThinkProgress must changed the title of the article at some point today after I submitted it to /r/politics. When I submitted the article, the title *was*,  "*Private Prison Corporations Spent $11 Million to Lobby For More Aggresive Immigration Policies*"

Do you think you still have to leave it removed ? Is it possible for you to leave the submission up and flair it something to the effect of "Title changed" ?  




 This is a great article. 

NBC News is such an utter shit show.

This completely dwarfs the Brian Williams scandal. Richard Engel is complicit in implicating the Assad regime and the Iranian government in his kidnapping during a time where US intervention in Syria was being debated in Congress. Engel absolutely knew that this would sway the American public in favor of intervening in Syria on behalf of the "moderate" rebels.  




 Please stop violating rule #1 of the sub. You can make your point without the racial slurs. Another comment like this will result in a ban. Thank you.  















































































 This will get downvoted out of easy visibility. I submitted a similar article and it didn't stand a chance, it was downvoted immediately after it was submitted.

 It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.  



















 Yea, I banned him for having no account history except for attacking other users on this thread. After I banned him for accusing a user of hacking into TimesofIsrael they threatened me and deleted their account before I could respond in kind. 

He's a real fucking nut and now that he's deleted that account he's probably here with an alt account now in a different form.

 All I know is Anthony better be logged in to his Reddit account for the funeral of the sub. 

I swear if Anthony's not here for the funeral of the sub I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive him (*sniff,sniff*), **period**.   









 Well Opie definitely strikes me as someone who likes to dole out ultimatums to people, because he enjoys having leverage over people in uncomfortable situations, be they professional or personal.  



















 This is a very serious issue that deserves careful consideration, and I expect to have a classified briefing in the near future, Schumer, who is Jewish, said in an emailed statement to Politico, the website reported on Monday evening. I strongly believe Congress should have the right to disapprove any agreement and I support the Corker bill which would allow that to occur. 


































 No wonder management likes him so much.  














 With the overall fan base, yes. 

With the Pests here on /r/opieandanthony, no.
 
Too much time has passed, it would be awkward now. The Opster certainly wouldn't get any solidarity points from me. 

B4 Ant got fired I foolishly thought these guys had each other's backs. Opie exposed their friendship for what it really was, they were good work friends and nothing more. 

To Opie, Ant is no more important than the person that you linger at the water cooler with to talk about sports and shit.  




 Yes, and you can endorse inherently racist policing practices, it won't change the fact that the majority of people aren't racist and won't condone institutionalized racism the way that you just did.

 Yes.

Nice try Opie. 
 




 I read this in Ant's voice, and it was awesome. Especially the 'Christ ! Even the Rolling Stones held it together'  
































































 Removed, rule 1.  




 "The report prompted a massive manhunt and topped the evening newscasts, even as a global nuclear deal with Israel's archenemy Iran was being announced."

They are attempting to keep their own citizens fearful of Arabs/Iranians/Palestinians. Elements within the Israeli defense department, most likely Mossad, don't want average Israelis to feel that bilateral progress was being made in the region with a treaty. This hoax topped the evening news in Israel, relegating the real story, the US treaty with Israel's nemesis Iran, to minor coverage, prioritizing it to a lower status than it truly is.  





























 Well it was filmed in LA and he's got a prescription. 




 "It appears Velentzas eventually became suspicious of the undercover agent's identity, allegedly using her phone in November and December to access webpages with titles like "Learning the Identity of a Confidential Informant," "How to Spot Undercover Police," "Is S/he an Informant?" She also researched how to detect bugs.

Yet she and Siddiqui continued to meet with the agent in the months that followed. Siddiqui purchased several propane tanks and stored them in her basement, and discussed them during the meetings. "I got everything up in this joint, I already told you. If you guys... once we learn... I got everything up in this joint," she allegedly said. "Yo, she got everything. This is like the Home Depot," the undercover agent responded."

 














 Thank you, this submission title is very misleading and I don't think OP has a very good grasp of the situation in Yemen. He seems to be conflating the Yemeni government which was recently ousted by the Houthi rebels and said Houthi rebels.   




 Are the Houthi in charge of the Yemeni military ? No, they are actively fighting the Yemeni military, there is an ongoing power struggle taking place here. To say the Yemeni government is gone and the Houthis now undeniably control Yemen would be inaccurate at best. 

Also I can't find what your title is iterating anywhere in the article you linked to, so there's that.  




 This title is misleading. If Saudi forces continue to bomb the Houthi rebels in Yemen, then *Houthi rebels* and not the Yemeni government, will launch a ground offensive against Saudi Arabia. For one thing, Yemen's ousted governments are the ones asking for Saudi intervention, to say that Yemen is going to invade Saudi Arabia is misleading to say the least.

You can't equate Iran-backed Houthi rebels to the Yemeni government and military.
