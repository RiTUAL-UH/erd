 All the agreement.  Even having them as custom games would make life more enjoyable. 





























 Ahri.... no explanation needed. 




 I tried this for hours...finally managed to get 0:0:0.....only to realize I hit it right on and need to get below that time.  
Most infuriating elixer I ever recieved. 




 7-9 summoning s are pretty sweet. Making sure you get all the hidden ones is key! 









 Sabin is a bit OP early game.
But, with proper esper equipped leveling you can make any and every character OP. 




 You can get an early Genji Glove when you enter The Returners Hideout.
When Banon askes you to be their "last hope" say "no" three times. Before you leave the hideout a random underling will pop up and give you one of the best relics in the game? 
























 It is usually the funny ones that have internal struggles that no one knows of.
Can't believe it... 














 Either method will yield the same result. 




 I feel like people who aren't teachers have improper perspective on the job itself. Where as people who are teachers have a "holier than thou" attitude. (Soley based on these posts).

I myself am a high school teacher.
Graduated 3rd (of 115) from my high school and was on the dean's list throughout 4 years while pursuing a BSc (double major in Biology and Psychology,  minor in Earth Science).
I'd like to think I am a relatively intellegent person, who went on to become a teacher. 

That being said, I agree that teaching isnt the toughest job in the world. My wife is an ICU Nurse...and I'd never be able to deal with the shit she does (ie. Shift work and people who could die at the drop of a hat). However,  as she has informed me, she'd never want to do what I do. Stand onfront of (on average) 120 15-17 year old kids and try to teach them things, prepare lessons that are engaging as well ad informative,  handle classroom management (such as that ine kid who just jumped out a window...or that other kid that just full on bitch smacked another kid).
My point is ever job has its difficulties and its easy portions, however until you have 1st hand experience (such that you have got the training, degrees, and job) don't knock it based on preconceived notions and shit experiences you've had with someone who was clearly not good at their job.

For me to get my current postion, I underwent an interview that 14 other applicants also took...but I managed to come out on top. This was after applying for a total of 12 other positions that individuals more experienced than myself recieved. Yes it's true that places are crying for teachers...but the government isn't putting money into education departments to allow for them to come in.


Tl:dr 
I'm was top of my class both in high school and university and became a teacher. My wife's an ICU nurse, I'd never fucking want that job and visa versa. All jobs have pros and cons, don't knock it unless you've actually done the job yourself. I've never smoked marijuana, but I dont condemn people who do. 




 Best option ever. I was in the same boat.
Rom hacks = OP
