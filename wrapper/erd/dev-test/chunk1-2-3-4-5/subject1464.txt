 Sandra?  




 If I lost a camera with all my personal pictures on it, I would love for someone to try and return it. I guess you think the OP should just wipe it and keep it? 




 I don't know...the extra 30 bucks a month I make from it sure comes in handy...;-)  




 Poor grammar.

Darn skools n-e-ways.  




 As much as you can under your circumstances. Even a short paragraph is a good start if it's all you have time for. More time? Keep going until you can't.

One of the biggest hurdles in writing is finding the time. (at least for me) 




 Want to crack a safe? Done

Life of crime? Easy

Save lives? Perfect! Can deflect bullets...more anything. All by thinking.

Choices would be unlimited.  




 Unlimited telekinesis. Really, not much else after that. 

Flying - Make yourself fly.

Need anything, poof you have it.  




 Google...Pokemon Online Multiplayer. 

Receive answer. 

Tada!  




 You...do not have a pre-teen daughter. 




 I would like this as well. I have a bunch just sitting around... 




 I would be a person that makes torpedoes out of scorpedoes, and that would be awesome! 




 Blood...She wanted more. 




 I can only speak for myself, but I try to keep my descriptions limited. When I read others books and they start to get all flowery with their writing I tend to just skip ahead. I like to form the scene in my own head and I trust my readers to be able to do the same.

Now, that being said, it is ultimately up to you how much description you add. Just be sure to get some good beta readers, and trust them if they say you don't need those four pages describing a chair. 




 It seems Amazon has finally realized that my collection of short stories have been free everywhere else but on their site, grab it now before they mess up and put it up again for $100 or something crazy like that.

 Yet... 




 Poverty? What's that? (Stuffs his -will write for food- sign behind his back) 




 I am happy to say, this is completely raw, all writing, no editing. But it was my first sentence, and is subject to change. 

Thanks :-)  




 Okay, first 3 lines...but...

The mirror lay in broken shards randomly strewn across the polished stone floor. This was the end. I had no escape left to me.


It's my current, almost finished, WIP. 




 It was public, and yep, massively downvoted.  




 Go ahead, or "go ahead and" 
i = I 
Doesn't = Don't
(This is the correct way to get down votes!)
 




 Ever do any beta reading? Or would you be interested in works in advance of publication for the purpose of honest feedback? I am in need of random strangers that would have no reason to -spare my feelings-.  




 I was considering opening my laptop and start writing some more, but I only had 45 mins...what do you read (listen to)? 




 Kids always wake up way before me...no morning time here. 




 I tell my wife to slow down on the cleaning and enjoy life more...she doesn't listen either. 




 I personally am enjoying the silence right now...not a single noise I am not making...so nice. 









 Latest one I am working on is entitled Mirror Thief. The main character can enter and exit the world in side a mirror. 




 A book cover for one of my works!  




 One does not simply -drive- into Mordor.  




 Just came to post the same thing, it's old news, still glad it happened to him, but old news the same. 




 I don't get a ton of random stranger complements, my wife says women flirt with me often, but I guess I don't see it. However, the few times I can recall a woman telling me they thought I was (something) I can say I was flattered, and I didn't think any more of it. But it doesn't happen often enough to remember more details. 

Not to mention a male perspective is too often skewed by inconsistencies.  




 Perhaps not so much a hit and run as a...shared moment in time.  




 I can see that, but would you take offense if no-one said anything, ever?
I haven't even owned a trench coat in years!

In all fairness, as another commenter said, this works just as well as a woman speaking to a man...Of course, most men would take it completely the wrong way and think a woman is reading to go all the way or something... 




 Ahhh! But a persons perspective changes everything. I honestly think most models are only mildly attractive if at all, I can see a mother smiling at a child, her hair a mess her clothing tossed and no makeup, yet think she is stunning. Does this make sense? 




 Yes...the internet can be a terrible medium for an open discussion sometimes. This was just a question I had rolling around in my head today when I saw a beautiful woman, natural beauty, not the purely painted kind. She was married as well, as I had helped her husband earlier...just a thought, no intent.

I also thought that, when did it become wrong to do something like this...were we always so afraid?

Sometimes I think too much.  




 Whew, but I still don't think I will randomly say it, cept to my wife. 




 I hope so, but I don't know for sure...didn't add the sarcasm smiley. :-)  




 How can this give offense? Do you wear makeup? Do you hair? Is it only for yourself...? Serious questions, I am honestly not trying to offend. 




 So if the person wondered away never to be seen again, this would be even more frightening to you? Or...? 




 I can understand that completely, that's why I am stressing the random/stranger/one moment aspect of it all. 




 I can't say I know that glint, but as a man myself it may be hard for me to know if I have it or not...I will ask my wife, she will know :-)  




 Thank you, I live in a smaller town, if I don't know the person, I probably know someone who does. But the thought has remained, why should it be wrong if it's completely innocent. 




 Any situation can be turned creepy by the wrong person, it's more the entire random, genuine moment, and finished... 




 Yes, I could understand the difference, I mean in a complete, random stranger, brush encounter, never to be seen again... 




 If you don't mind answering? Why? I often see women I think are completely stunning, I have no interest in them in other ways, so I keep my thoughts to myself. But why would it offending, I am generally interested. Also, as a side note, I have a scene like this in one of my writings and wondered at the realism of it, since I don't see people doing it. 









 You do have to be in the USA though... :-( 




 Thank you. It's a tough racket to get into. 




 When the car is not running, I assume you read her other comments, the battery is not being charged. She also stated this wasn't the first time, and she knew it should have been replaced long ago. 

If the car had died, while running, than yes...replace the alternator. 

Do some reading before you randomly comment like this, it only makes you look like...well, you said it best.  




 It's *Band* and no...I don't mind them being hidden at all.  




 I would settle for more book sales, but I will take the cookie for now. ;) Thank you.
 




 Yes, I really do. Getting the wife to help can be problematic though, and I need to keep them away from windows (and the kids). But it does help with a level of realism in sword fighting scenes.  




 I have a couple of swords in my collections just for this exact purpose. 




 *This. 




 For my action scenes it does help to think it through and sometimes get up to mimic the motions. Anything to bring the realism to my readers.  




 Here is an article to help you understand. 

http://m.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/first-google-glass-users-cant-sell-or-even-loan-their-1C9506946

There is still a lot that's hush hush with them. 




 Google glasses can not be traded or resold. If you do, they can remotely disable them. In theory, this pair can no longer be disabled. 




 I too have been trapped by the wonderings of....squirrel! 




 I make sure that if I am in a reading stint I keep my writing to a minimum, and visa versa. I guess you could say, I too, am influenced by what I am reading at the moment. 









 Now that I can see as a better reason to write here.

 If 1.50 won't even buy a coffee to fuel the writing = no point. 

But, 1.50 will now feed you for a week... 




 I think in this instance the old adage -you get what you pay for- does truly apply here. For the most part the people hiring here seem to want things fast and dirty.

Mostly dirty. 




 I can't stop reading them! It's like watching a train wreck. Paying 1.50 per hour for you to write erotica...must write at least 2 stories a day...I can make more than that just writing my own stories.  




 TIL: People expect writers to work for nothing. 

5000 words a day min for 15 dollars? 25 dollars for a 60k book edit? 

Ouch.  




 He would have gotten away if he just pulled up his pants... 




 Damn my memory!!! 




 Damn my memory! Demon's souls! My bad... 




 Yeah, not the last boss. Not even close. 




 Please hold for a very important message. 




 Hit me with a PM and I will email you a PDF tomorrow night. :-)  




 It actually snows very little up there, mostly just wind blowing it around. 




 I say... Dead. 









 Read the comments. There were none made before today. People make pages all the time, I even have a few. It's very simple to change the name. 




 Obviously. And this post has been made by many others, they have been shown the same thing. 




 Yes, the page was, it was renamed today. Anyone can do this. 




 Really? Right off the front page?  




 Welcome, please feel free to tell your friends as well. More the merrier! 




 If your check engine light comes on, you should take it to a mechanic. I would leave the pets behind when you do... 




 They are now free! Feel free to grab them, and let your friends know as well. Thank you.  




 Once you DL them, they are yours to read. If you should erase them at a later date, you can re-dl them at no charge. Enjoy! 









 Thank you! I will post it up there instead. I searched for the right place to put this. Guess I didn't search far enough. 




 Everyone has a gift and it would be a true waste if you were to erase yours. I am happy to have been able to share in the experience of your gift. Keep it up. 




 I wouldn't mind seeing something like this. I try to add what I can when people ask, but I have to agree that some of the requests are a touch daunting for the time I have available. 




 This is pretty clinical. You need to drop some details and add some spice. You have to give me (your readers) something to say, hey, I have to grab this story! 
 




 You find any, let me know. I make less than you do and my wife and I are sitting here right now trying to find ways to come up with more money.
I write books on the side and try to sell them, but I don't even have enough time to push them properly.

It's a no win situation and I wish you the best. 




 I just went through rotator cuff surgery. Torn tendon.

Doesn't sound as bad as yours does. I was told 6 weeks in a sling, I was out in 4. I was told 6 months before lifting anything, it's been 10 weeks and I am at about %80 strength. Gaining mobility and strength every week. Slow and steady here.

Did it hurt? 

Hell yah.

It's better now though...and I don't have any of the pain that I had before. I wouldn't worry about it. If it hurts now, you will deal with it later. The end result is worth it. 




 I am not a DR, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night, how about you go see a real doctor instead of asking for help online? 

You know, like real medical advice? 




 Time itself. 




 But they are always making more lego, so...63...64...65... 




 350 words and 19 of them are wheel or wheelbarrow...I almost thought I knew what you were trying to say here, but then I lost it. 

I'm sorry.

If his was meant to be abstract writing, I believe you went a little too far from the edge, and fell off.  




 First thing I think I can help you with is...

With reddit it, it erases your formatting. The best way to get it back is to do a double carriage return. That will help make this patch more readable. I had the same problema couple days ago.

Second thing of note, the boy was supposed to be scared, but he sure was talkative. As a personality trait, most people when afraid clam up. A better way to make this come alive is to keep your sentences shorter, and more choppy, when he is speaking.

Other than those little things, I like what I see. You do create a not traditional mermaidimage, but it works. 




 I am a big fan of the -show don't tell- writing style, and your first line starts me on an edge. I can understand the need to tell if you are trying to keep a story as short as possible, but perhaps some more description would spice up the writing.

"The trees surrounded me. Their canopy so thick it was impossible to tell if it was night or day."

Now, that's a simplistic take on what I see, I could be completely wrong if your intent was the opposite.

Just my two bits. 




 I can try to dredge up some sites. If you do a search on reddit I am fairly confident you will find multiple posts on the subject.

The biggest downside is the time investment, review sights can take months (or longer) to get to your work. Coordinating it all to come together for a big send off is a big commitment.

In case you are wondering, I learned most of this because I made the same mistake on my first releases. Live and learn though. 




 Reviews can make or break your work. It's best to give out free copies to reviewers and cross your fingers they like it. It's a very hard thing to do, but honest reviews with ups and downs are worth more than gold. 

People don't like taking a chance, even at free.

My best month I had almost 5k free downloads on my works, it resulted in 3 reviews, and one of those was 1 star because he didn't get around to reading it.

#bangsheadonwall
 




 I wish you the best, but for the best exposure, you really need to start the promo at least one month in advance. The more time you have to get ready, the better.

You need to have reviews up and ready.

It's best to have as many blogs as possible showing his work and having interviews or at least something up.

On twitter, you should be doing a contest, a giveaway, something to pull in more readers.

On facebook , goodreads, LinkedIn, and as many other sites as you can get, you need to do pre-posts weeks in advance. Try to drag in as much anticipation as you can.

Local book stores, some hate indie's others are quite open to all others, run a giveaway if you can, and if they let you, try to have some posters up to promote your release day.

Sorry, this is off the top of my head, and typed on my tablet, I am sure I missed a thing or two, but good luck regardless! 




 This is incredible, tell your Grandpa that I applaud him. If he does decide to publish it, make sure he does his research if he chooses indie publishing.  




 It was my intent to have an overtone of a slowly fading beat, the heart. Perhaps I went a little to strong with it. Thank you. 




 If you lose your internet, you can't play the game. Even if it is a solo game. Like Sim City was/is. 




 The ring of the phone faded into the back of Tara's mind. It was an older phone, heavy, with a rotary dial, and in a shade of light green that was once popular. The color had always reminded her of pea soup, the kind her long past grandmother used to make. The ringing would stop if she left it long enough. It always stopped, and she always ignored it.

Sitting in an old chair, its cover ripped and stained, her arms stretched out, she felt the coarse material under her. Her skin was only a shadow barely seen. A window showed the only light in the room, the faint glow coming through it. She pulled the darkness in close around her, a comfortable friend.

The weatherman had been right about the rain, for once. The steady dripping against her windowsill comforted her in a way she couldn't explain. It tapped out a rhythm matching the heart beating inside her chest. The two intertwined, leaving Tara unsure where one started, and the other ended. The weak light from outside showed the tiny rivers of water cascading down along the glass, hoping to join their brothers and sisters again in a sea of lost friends. The tears they made in their brief visit to her world reminded her of those that fell down her own face. Untouched by humanity, they left only faint traces, as they too escaped to join new friends of a different color, pooling on the floor.

The cold Tara felt was not from the window, or from her dark room. It was a chill from the inside. Others had told their last story and she had drunk the words. Always thirsty for the knowledge they released before the end. She knew this feeling would come, a familiar friend and a welcome one.

Eyelids became heavy for a moment, blurring the window before her, its surface still heavy with rain. She longed to see the heavens one last time, but the streetlight outside stole the night sky from her, the dark clouds blanketing the sky. The faint glow from the street lamp pierced the rain on the glass, creating a million stars shining in front of her eyes, before her slow, tired blink wiped them clear. A smile broke on her lips touched with a blue from her spreading inner cold.

Fingertips painted a slow river of glistening red. They dripped down in a rhythm unlike the rain, painting a poor canvas stretched across the floor. She thought the drops were falling slower than they should. They landed at random, uncaring whether they matched the patterns created around them. A drummer, who played his own beat while the rest of the band played on.

She took a deep breath, and felt sudden warmth. Tara had done all the research, and they hadn't gotten this right. Her fading mind enjoyed the sensation. It spread from inside, like that first sip of a hard drink, a falsehood that promised comfort, but never delivered.

Her eyes were heavy again, and her vision sprinkled with hints of diamonds, the window a blur. The phone rang again, a distant sound, farther than the blood, farther than the rain. They faded as the darkness took over.

The rain stopped.
 









 Thank you all for the input.
My wife interupted me tonight, but I managed to get a minor 500 words down. It's better than nothing, and a start in what I believe is the right direction.  



























































 Someone threatening my family. 




 Unless you are able to make up new words, you will be using words others have used regardless. It's normal, keep writing.

For the record, I made up the word 'bapple' you can't use that one. 




 I am a 6f tall, shaved head, goatee'd face, tattoo'd 220lb white male...you want to talk about profiling? I can't even cross a border with my kids in the back seat, they will search the car and ask my kids if I am their area dad.

Profiling works both ways here. 




 I finally had Amazon price match one of my works to free...and that single book is averaging around 250 'sales' a month.

My other works sell comparitavely slow, anywhere from zero - the low teens per month.

Of course, my promo time has been drastically reduced as of late and that is effecting my sales. As well as the fact I am working on my next release.

As far as patterns go? Yeah, if I self promo a ton, I sell more works, if I am silent, so are my sales.

 Actually, we trained for everything.

I trained my students for handling a drive by shooting.

When they got to the basic exam, it was a breeze because the basic scenerios were so easy com paired to what we practiced.

And yes, we used a weight, now remember that 50lbs on dry land is not 50lbs underwater.

We also taught students self defense in water, how to disable a panicked victim as well as how to get out of the grasp of someone who is trying to drown you.

I may add, I am a Canadian, our training has always been harder, my classes were harder than that.

One of my students has even gone on to be an Emerg DR in our local hospital. We still stay in contact. 




 I trained lifeguards for about 9 years of my life, you could have saved him with the right training.

But you don't have it.

You did your best, and are alive today because of that failure. I would say keep trying to find the woman, even if it is to only exchange a note, or a picture. It can greatly help with the closure you need.

You did the right thing.  




 I already did that one...sorta...I used solar radiation instead. :-)  




 Ferris Beulers day off...always a good watch. 




 Until we found out they used real animals and killed a couple dozen while filming, this was one my kids loved to watch. Not any more. 




 Found it! They messed the math it seems, best not make the same mistake.

 It's a drain. I don't drink from a drain pipe either. 




 Married my wife 7 years ago, but this year hasn't been lucky in the least. 




 My wife and I have been together for 9 years. This is our seventh anniversary and it was supposed to be a special one. 7 month 7 years on the 7th.

We had planned everything out, but about two days before we left, the whole family got sick. And I mean, SICK. Chronic fevers, persistent nagging dry cough, sore throats, ear infections. Plumbing went south, the whole works. So we are sitting with the kids and contemplating just packing it in 3 days early, and driving the 9 hours back home to just suffer there.

We forced ourselves to do a hike yesterday. And paid for it at night. It was one thing off a list of about 6 things we wanted to do.

It took us almost a whole year to save for this trip, we get one a year at best. And now it's a wipe.

This sucks on so many levels. 




 Samples?

Hit us with the first frame when you get it, would love to see it. 




 While I can't answer all your questions, I can tell something like this was done on star trek TNG. Perhaps some research into the science of what they did might help you. 




 My wife, my kids, my family. 




 The sun came up this morning,
It will again tomorrow,
These times an be tough, but you will pull through.
 




 Ahhhh! ooohhhh.... hmn. 




 My wife was 20 when we met, I was 31. What you are doing is perfectly normal, and a smart decision.

Your father...is your father. You will always be his little girl. I say this while looking at my 7yr old daughter watching my little ponies. One day, your dad and I will have more in common. Remember this and things will turn around for you. 




 From what you have said you are already -okay- with it. It's just the option of having a place to run to should you need it. Thats's easy to fix, find another place you can claim as yours for a few minutes/hours whatever you need. 

Library.

Coffee shop.

Another friends place. 

Always options. You will be fine. 




  The publishing game is truly one of the most ass backwards businesses...

You got me there. I would argue this if I could even think of a way to...

It just takes a single look at the rise of indie titles to see how the tides are shifting...even if slowly. 




 Losing control of your work isn't what you should be looking for in a contract. I know this goes against all common sense as an author, but you can decline a contract...If your publisher doesn't consult you on changes, makes all decisions for you, and treats you like the janitor...find another publisher. There are lots out there, and if your work is good enough for one, another will be interested.

Of course, on the other side of the coin, if this is all fine with you, hand over your labour of love, kiss it goodbye and start pushing a work that may or may not be what you started with.

Oddly enough, almost everyone who has responded to my comments are making great points for going Indie. I hope the OP is still reading them. 




  My publisher does no marketing...

That line alone makes my mind scream - find a better publisher! - 

Other than the advance, there would be no reason to even use them. 




 What other field should I pull my advice from if not the range of my own experience?

I class any traditionally published author as lucky, whether they have to push their own work or not.

I do believe many publishers are encouraging their authors to push their own work, after all, more sales are better for everyone. Yet, sometimes the time could be better spent creating more works for the masses that are waiting for it with baited breath!

(All readers still wait with baited breath right?) 




 I guess it would depend on who you are trad pub through. I have many author friends that actually are told to write and leave the promo to the people who are paid to do it. 




 There is some, thing, on the, wing... ( sorry couldn't help it.) 




 If you have unlimited time and energy, I say go indie. 

If you are human, shoot for traditional. 

This coming from an indie author...you spend %90 of your available time trying to find more ways to promote your work, and much less time actually writing it. If you expect quick cash from indie, think again. You really have to work for your sales and even a small lapse in promotion can make a big change in the trickle of sales you might have.

Of course, some indies do great.

Just not this guy...yet. 




 Up vote from a guy with a goatee and has nicked the edges of more times then I can count. 




 Okay, so straight out...I assume you are barely over 18 if at all, but when you were (are some day?) Have you ever felt an attraction to any younger woman, at all. Yes or no will suffice. 




 And the exact opposite is implied by yourself.

You seem to think that even though you never thought like this ever, (really?) that everyone else must not think that way too.

Or you willing to admit you are human now? Unless...you are the 18 yr old in question, then your reluctance to admit human nature makes much more sense. 









 No...I said in my experience...

 You are including the world.

And now at the age of 40, I know that this is still true more often than not.  




 You mean to tell me that you weren't? Or you aren't a man...please. Lie if you like. Whatever makes you happy. I controlled myself, like many others, but to deny the fact, that's just sad. 




 Or she has a few of her friends over to have a -talk- with him...or not...just speaking as a dad of a soon enough to be teen daughter.

PS: I was an 18 yr old boy once, we can't be trusted...even though I was raised with morals, I still knew what I wanted. 




 Being on the front page of Reddit... oh wait, that wasn't a dream!

 All works on Amazon are a hard sell as an indie author. Do the shore sell better than my full story at 96k? No, but no worse either.

When I released them, Amazon had no option for distinction, they were just e-books. 




 Books 1-4 of the jumper series are all independent, yet best read in order. Book 5 ( in the works) pulls all the characters Introduced in the first 4 together, with resolution. Books 1-4 are 10-14k each, and 5 is slated around 42k long...after I have released 5 I plan on doing a full collection. Perhaps 6-12 months later. 




 Basically, if nothing is happening, why does your reader have to know it? Is what the character eating important to the story line?

If it doesn't progress the story, consider cutting it all together. 




 Very Welcome! 

Hope you enjoy it, and the book too!  




 He was doing it, koodo's alone for just that. 

And front page in 22 minutes. Don't know it that's a record or not, but dang...
 









 I took a different approach. 

I have 1 story, broken into 5 parts. I released each part as it finished (10-14k) and am working on the final chapter (roughly 40k, and by chapter I mean...ending)

While they are away with edits, I work on other projects, and am almost ready to release another 42k story.

It's not that hard if you don't mind having a couple irons in the fire at the same time. 




 I don't want your gold, hit up my books on Amazon instead and buy some of my books, cheaper and we both win! 

 




 Once you get enough works out, you can drop one to free. That way you can always count on a couple numbers on your Amazon page. Works for me anyway. Might not get paid, but not as depressing as that brown bar. 




 Raising a child is a decision. I too have had to make the same one, but from the other side. While to this day I still wonder what might have been, I regret, yet don't, my (our) decision.

Did you do what's right? 

No idea.

Did I?

No idea.

I am glad that you were smart enough to think before you made it, and not do something foolish...yet :-) 

Enjoy your life, plenty of time for children later on if the opportunity comes again. 




 Be very clear on your POV shifts, be it with new chapters, larger line breaks, or using dialog tags. Readers are easily confused if you don't make it clear. 




 And what was the point of this? To try and drag someone down? Maybe...just maybe...they won't try again.  




 I think it might be flooded... 




 Don't thank me. It's all you.  




 And with the smile he gave you, your beauty only increased. Enjoy your day, you are gorgeous. 




 Or don't take any breaks and plow ever forward. My first work I took breaks and never finished it. Some people write better all at once, never stopping. 




 Well I would be honored if you decided to grab one of mine some day. 




 **********-********-**********-*********

I used a number hider so you have to use your memory. :-)  




 I can make up stories inside my head and people pay to read them. 




 Bah...Amazon is always missing my books...when will they ever learn.

(Hey, I did hit the top 100 a couple times already this year! Just not for long...)  




 You are still breathing,
Your heart is still beating,
You haven't given up yet.
Keep moving forward
One step at a time.
You can start with sharing your art.
I, for one, want to see it.

I wrote poems when I suffered with depression. They are gone now, but they helped me with perspective. Art doesn't have to be everything to everyone. It just has to speak, someone will listen.

Now I write books. My angers and fears are found in thier pages. My art gives the escape when I need it.

Don't lose yours. 




 Speaking as a man that dated those girls, you are much better off. 

And koodos on the writing! That too is a hard road. Let me know if you ever want to swap a story. 




 Really? With the username gingerkid1234 you ask this? 




 "Think" 




 That's odd...if you pm your email, and choice, I will email you it tonight. 









 In the malls, book stores, coffee shops... 




 Great read, I honestly had no idea, and I consider myself rather well read...Thank you! 




 Hmn...And yet I see more people reading in public in the summer time. Maybe Canada is backwards in this...or we all hide when it snows... 




 I have heard it can help...course...it doesn't "always" help... 




 It's funny how easy it is to say, just do this...yet in practice it can be so far from easy.

Reviews - Check, plenty of great, and honest, reviews on my work. General concencuss is that -I are a good writer- ;-)

Covers - Meh...I have them. Could be better.

Categories - I cross genres a lot...did the best I could

Marketing - Limited budged and time. Every minute pushing is a minute not writing, working on the balance constantly. 




 All my works are still available via Amazon, and they have finally (took over a year) price matched one of my works for free. Unless you live in Canada, then it's still full price. Figure that one out...
 




 This time of year?

Never thought of book sales as having a best "time". What would be the best for pushing my next work that's coming out?

December? 




 No, my works are still available...and yes... under KDP Select, they willl "push" your work for you and submit it to others via email and the like...

I can't say they are, but I can't say they aren't either. You have to be pretty naive to think that in today's world things like this won't happen.

Is it happening to me? No idea...no way to prove it either way. 




 In short, I have been self publishing for over three years. I have used KDP to give away and do some small promo's with my works. My best month was last December when I put a really large push. I had over 5000 downloads of my works, all free.

Since that time I have seen a steady drop until this month where my books are almost at a dead stand still again.

Amazon sent me a letter that I had to remove my works from other markets, as they were in conflict with the rules of KDP. (They, Amazon, have changed the rules so many times now since I started, I just ignored them until caught. Yes, I know, my bad.) In response I told Amazon to remove all my works from KDP and they agreed.

As of that day, I have not seen a single sale of my work.

Have I been blackballed for not playing nice with Amazon?
Has anyone else seen results like this?

What are your thoughts on it?

(For some reason Authors have a very hard time coming clean with actual numbers of book sales. I don't have that problem, but I can understand if you wish to be vague about your own. It's your choice of course.) 




 You killed my father! Prepare to die... 




 A law enforcement officer is not exempt from laws. They will be ignored though if you ever decided to try and press a charge. The officers have no magic powers that make them able to do things any safer than the rest of us. 

Google how many times a police officer has caused a car crash and you will see what I mean. 




 Stop and look inside the next cop car you see, they have so many gadgets inside it's a wonder they can see outside the window. This photo might have been a fake, but I have seen many officers use a cell while driving. 




 Keep it minimal, unless those doors REALLY matter... 




 If you find yourself using the word -I- all the time, drop it. It's the best way to avoid poor first person writing. 

No-one wants to read

I walked to the store.
I opened the door.
Inside the store I looked for the poptarts.
I paid too much for them, but I like them enough to do it anyway.

Of course, sometimes -I- is unavoidable, but use it sparingly. 




 It only took five beats from the moment he jumped, but those seemed an eternity.

One.

The wind punished Aiden, shoving, and wrenching at his ruined clothes.

Two.

His arms stretched out, the magic built around him forming a bubble in time.

Three.

The scene of potential death burned itself into his memory, even with eyes closed.

Four.

In an instant a tunnel opened, seemingly to pass through the air itself.

Five.

*****

Aiden and Jess were only working on a science experiment to prove that the speed of light could in fact be broken. What they didn't expect is what would happen when they actually did it.

Time itself factures and Aiden is thrown forward into a future where humanity seems to be gone. Plants and animals survive, but the planet is in ruins. Through fate and a little help of magic returned, he manages to find a way to jump into his own past, and attempt to correct what he broke.


With each jump back Aiden unknowingly pulls someone else into his future. Those lucky few also find themselves with new power to go with the changed world. 




 9: And the government does not listen in on your cell phone calls...oh wait... 




 Not with a roar, but with a whimper. 




 Search out the new texture mod, you will fall in love all over again! 




 Mine-sales, rather be a paid author...working on it. 




 At 40 I suddenly feel much younger, thanks! 




 Old man? I just turned 40! Guess that's like 120 in Reddit years... 




 I am still stuck on step 23... 




 You can skip step 7 and just change it to -swear you will never write again- 




 Oddly, mine would be around the 10 mark as well. And I never want to read it again...okay maybe one day, but one day long from now. 




 It was a dark and stormy night. 




 True, but I do give him points for the attempt!  









 You can get it for a buck or so here...

E-book first I found was a hundred bucks, didn't sound right to me. 
 









 Some mornings I feel like it, but no...not 89. 




 Welcome, life is a journey, and sharing it with some one else can make it even more rewarding. 




 The ring of the phone faded into the back of Tara's mind. It was an older phone, heavy, with a rotary dial, and in a shade of light green that was once popular. The color had always reminded her of pea soup, the kind her long past grandmother used to make. The ringing would stop if she left it long enough. It always stopped, and she always ignored it.


Sitting in an old chair, its cover ripped and stained, her arms stretched out, she felt the coarse material under her. Her skin was only a shadow barely seen. A window showed the only light in the room, the faint glow coming through it. She pulled the darkness in close around her, a comfortable friend.

The weatherman had been right about the rain, for once. The steady dripping against her windowsill comforted her in a way she couldn't explain. It tapped out a rhythm matching the heart beating inside her chest. The two intertwined, leaving Tara unsure where one started, and the other ended. The weak light from outside showed the tiny rivers of water cascading down along the glass, hoping to join their brothers and sisters again in a sea of lost friends. The tears they made in their brief visit to her world reminded her of those that fell down her own face. Untouched by humanity, they left only faint traces, as they too escaped to join new friends of a different color, pooling on the floor.

The cold Tara felt was not from the window, or from her dark room. It was a chill from the inside. Others had told their last story and she had drunk the words. Always thirsty for the knowledge they released before the end. She knew this feeling would come, a familiar friend and a welcome one.


Eyelids became heavy for a moment, blurring the window before her, its surface still heavy with rain. She longed to see the heavens one last time, but the streetlight outside stole the night sky from her, the dark clouds blanketing the sky. The faint glow from the street lamp pierced the rain on the glass, creating a million stars shining in front of her eyes, before her slow, tired blink wiped them clear. A smile broke on her lips touched with a blue from her spreading inner cold.


Fingertips painted a slow river of glistening red. They dripped down in a rhythm unlike the rain, painting a poor canvas stretched across the floor. She thought the drops were falling slower than they should. They landed at random, uncaring whether they matched the patterns created around them. A drummer, who played his own beat while the rest of the band played on.


She took a deep breath, and felt sudden warmth. Tara had done all the research, and they hadn't gotten this right. Her fading mind enjoyed the sensation. It spread from inside, like that first sip of a hard drink, a falsehood that promised comfort, but never delivered.


Her eyes were heavy again, and her vision sprinkled with hints of diamonds, the window a blur. The phone rang again, a distant sound, farther than the blood, farther than the rain. They faded as the darkness took over.


The rain stopped. 




 Listen to each other.

Don't expect some one to change for you if you aren't willing to change for them. 

Take some time for yourself every now and again.

Talk, about everything, always.

Never, ever, end a day while still angry. Even if it means staying up all night.

Remember what you fell in love with in the first place.

Know that people change as they grew older, the trick is to be try and change together, and enjoy each others changes. 




 My wife was 20 when we met, 9 years later and we are still going strong! 




 I have given myself tingles...but not cried. Least, not yet. 




 Find a writing partner. Set goals for each other and have incentives to get them accomplished. Exchange your work with a set deadline to keep the pace up.

If you don't have someone to work with, and you are left working alone, perhaps you need to get into a set routine. -This- is your writing time, and you make it so every day. After a few weeks it will become habit and your problem should be solved. 




 I have a close circle that has access to my works in progress, as well as some -teasers- I have been known to toss up on twitter and FB from time to time. Helps keep the interest up when you have nothing new to release. 




 Did not realise this was a repost. Sorry, just saw the news myself. 









 Not a mechanic, but am the guy who sells the parts. Chevy...any Chevy and we have the parts for it on the shelf. Imports break the least. There is a reason Chevy almost went bankrupt and Ford is the #1 seller. 




 Slurm! 




 My biggest struggle is exposure. I can write, people tell me they like it (even strangers!) Yet, I can't seem to break out of the couple of books a month in sales. I blog, I tweet, I hop...yet finding readers takes so much time, I rarely have enough to write.  
























 That's because you actually have to work to get to Carnegie Hall. 




 Store is busting with savings! 




 Only when you are happy with your story can you just shift to simple editing. Unfortunately as an author it's hard to ever say "I'm done!" When you can upload another version in a matter of minutes.  




 And as a gif it all plays at 2Fps. 




 Every work I have done uses multiple POV's. Keep them clearly defined and you will have no problems. 




 It isn't a big deal. It's your choice, and I have known many couples that are happy with that choice.

It wasn't the same for me, but that was my choice.

You get one life, live it the way YOU want. 




 Brandon Sanderson is a good start,
Or an unknown indie working on breaking into the field,
Jamie Heppner.

Both are available via amazon. 




 Populus?
 




 Novel is done,

Sales are slow,

Need more readers.

Promotion didn't do near as well as I had hoped.


Sadness had followed. 




 Was one of the biggest jokes in Canadian history.

I actually dated one of his friends...guy was a chronic smoker. 

However, pot is not a enhancing substance, if anything it slowed him down.  




 Still think it's a joke? 









 Perhaps re-read your own post, and the follow up posts. You will soon find that I never said it was the (best show ever)

I did however question whether or not you actually watched it.
As for the reasons I love it? 
I found it entertaining. 
I connected with the characters and felt the loss when they were killed in the wrap up movie.
I saw a story line that was only given the shortest of time to scratch the surface of potential.
However, that doesn't mean a damn thing to you, and it shouldn't, because it's my opinion. AND your thread asked for that. 

Anything else you want to try and ditch me on? 




 Well I can understand from what you have said why you wouldn't enjoy it. After all, reading the last chapter of a book first is the best way to truly enjoy the work.

And all the reasons you just cited why you didn't enjoy it were a great argument for your own case...


Oh wait. 




 Do you really need to ask that? 

By your question alone we can tell you have never watched it... 









 As a little back story. I have been an e-book author for a long time. After more than a little pushing by my friends and readers, I decided to get one of my books into an actual physical copy. 

It's been a long road, but I am glad to say I've made it! Now, off to finish up the next one and get it paperback ready. 









 I start with the basics. Who are the players, what are they doing, and what just went wrong.

From there all you have to do is try and keep up. 




 If you were to take away most technology, you would end up back in a more western setting. That being said, if you were in an eastern society, you would end up in a similar situation, with an eastern twist of course.

A good read with a modern twist is -The Event- dystopian future mixed with fantasy elements and historic elements for flavour. 




 I just read this thread and its replies, I am sorry but what I see is you have an opinion on writing and you wish evyone else to see things your way. Unfortunately, there is a time and a place for using the word -said- in your writing. Some people may over use it, others might ejaculate another word in its place too often. The only right answer is to use it whenever you feel like in your own writing.

If I have only learned one thing in my writing life it would be...

Write the way you want.

For every person that loves what you do, there will be two more that think it's crap. 




 Actually, that would be...Well, that's emarrassing. 




 Eat your vegetables.

#Shiver 




 You might want to look closer. Here if a child is removed as an infant it is often the case that foster parents raise them for life. Might be worth looking into. 




 I don't know what country you are in, but if it is in Canada, you might want to look into a foster program. You can foster a child from shortly after birth, and in many cases it turns out to be long term/life. 

I know it isn't the same, but...? 




 2011

Yes, Rabies kills. 

So far there is only 1 case of anyone surviving. 

Well done.  




 First thing, use double enter to put a break in your paragraphs, this will make that wall of text a lot easier to read.

Just like that.

Edit up that mess, and we will look again. 




 If you set all this up in word you can see the page count, or else just put it into Createspace and it will tell you the page count as well.  




 Yep, and I just replied to her. 




 2500 up front, but later he was paid 400k, of which he got exactly half. Still about 399453 more than I have made from selling my works. 




 If you have time to sit here and use reddit, you have time for a part time job.  




 I am really sorry, but without a day job to pay your bills, odds are you will not make a living as a writer. I have been writing for almost 6 years and I don't make much at all per month. Almost every dollar I do make goes back into my writing somehow. 
Perhaps it will all change now that I have actual paperbacks coming out, but only time will tell. 
Keep writing, never stop, but don't expect to get rich from it. It just doesn't happen very often. 




 You rock!

And speaking for my wife, who has the same problems with her mother, I will point you out to her in the hopes your story can offer her some inspiration. 









 4 over the last 5 days? How are you still sane?  




 As long as they remembered their towel, everything will be okay. 




 I have done some extensive beta reading, if you need another please send me a PM. A couple pages to my email, and I can show you what I can do. 




 You are far too enlightened to simply be a cab driver. 




 Write a book. Seriously. You might not get rich, but I wouldn't mind reading it. 


If you don't know how to write one, talk to me, or one of a couple hundred other authors on here to help you. 




 Shhhh, don't cry. 




 Most of my family doesn't read, or care, about what I write. The few who do understand that I am writing a story, not a personal diary. 

Give them a shot, you might be surprised. 




 A picture of a hand pushing through a reflection in a mirror, while still showing the reflection. 




 On the rims, maybe. Practice a bit on something else to learn how far away to hold the spray can. Too far, mist. Too close, runs.

Calipers don't matter as much, hard to see, and if you do have runs the angles will hide any poor spraying problems. 




 Google + YouTube.

However, cleaning is key, specially for the calipers. As for rims, clean and a good etch primer is a great place to start.

More prep you do, better result you will get. 




 You are 19 and you just learned your parents have sex...

News flash son...you were created somehow. 




 BC has some of the highest taxes anywhere. It cost me $1.76 just to type this.  









 As far as I have found, KSP is the only conflict I have found in self publishing. 




 Nailed it. 




 I think you have missed the point of this anology.  




 I think it's more like the ideas are the blueprints. Houses and foundations can be fixed. Blueprints are worth only the paper they are printed on.
 




 I have a core of 4. I don't anyone to tell me how awesome my work is, I know it has flaws. I just need my beta readers to rip it up and tell me what doesn't work. Honesty is worth gold when you have to depend on others. 




 No. This was just taken yesterday. Mama wasn't happy to see us, lots of huffing and stamping. 




 Funny, I will tell that to my wife... 




 Canadian here, we wave and say hi.
 









 Have you ever passed on a book to only have it succeed elsewhere?  




 At least they didn't explode...

Next time, used computer fans for cooling, quiet and run off cheep rechargeable batteries.  




 This is the best thing I have seen on Reddit in a long time! Awesome!  




 Missed the title somehow. 

The book is called "Mirror Thief" And will be out soon in hard cover and e-book.  




 His parents ignore him.


His motorcycle is trashed from the accident.


He has nowhere to sleep, no money left, and no job to earn more.
With few options open to him, Dario's future is dark, and depression is sneaking around the frame of his world.


That is until his fingers push through the boundary of the reflection in front of him, and he learns that he can move through a world others can only see.


Now... can he use this to fix the errors of his past, or will crime be the only option?
 




 -The Event- By J. Heppner on Amazon. 

It's got a little of everything in it. I hear that it's even going to paperback in the next month or so... 




 My wife is a SAHM and she works a lot harder than I do. It's a tougher job than most people think, and you should take pride in the fact you appear to be doing it right. 




 He's got my vote, and I will read (and have) anything he puts out. If someone were to compare my writing to his, I would take it as a big complement. 




 Or you could have clicked the save button way up top instead of getting down voted... 




 Level up armor, weapons, and spells...you can still do it. Just makes you win worth more solo! 




 Depends on if you do bosses solo or with help...everyone has a harder time with diff bosses. 




 I'm still stuck at the hundredaire...perhaps one day I might see the thousandaire...time will tell. 




 Plenty of good advice already, so I will just inject the humor...

Bbbrrraaaiiinnnsss.... (said in a zombie slur) 




 Maybe you need to step back from the screen now and again. Sounding a touch too hurt for something -you- have seen before. 




 Inconceivable that two people could have the exact same thought, at different times. 




 Hit the friend button, say thanks for the help, and see what happens. 




 -The Event- has a touch of that, thrown in with some Apocalypse terror. 




 You know where the breaker panel in your house is?  




 Check your breakers, reset the one that has the hot water tank on it. 




 My wife and I just left the theater, and almost every person left their garbage behind. When did this become okay? Are we a civilization of slobs that just simply expect others to clean up after us?  




 Do. You. Have. A. Canoe. I. Could. Borrow. Please. 




 It doesn't matter what you saw at the end, all those memories you just shared are what made him special.

Wherever he is now, he knows you miss him, and loves you too. 




 Fuck. That. Shit. You are perfect the way you are. 

If that's all people care about, you are with all the wrong people.

You need someone to talk to, let us know. We are all people just like you. 




 Yes, worst faceswap in the history of the sport. Not my doing... 









 You sound like a budding author. Time to dig out the pen and paper. Get those raw thoughts down! 




 Poorly, I mostly look at cat pictures. 




 Word of the day toilet paper.

Someone had to put some humor in! 




 Nice to know I have been outselling at least 1 other other on Amazon. Sorry I don't really have a question for you...yet. 




 I think you missed the link you intended to add. 




 Longest loading gif ever... 




 It took me almost four years. I started with over 25k in debt, at about 21 years old. 

And a general labourer is a decent trade. Throw out an add in craigslist for a helping hand worker or try to find a roofing crew. With effort you will dig yourself out. 




 What skills do you have?
Side jobs for cash can make a big difference.

It will take work, but you can do it. I know so, because I have done it. 




 If I plan ahead, it never gets done. My characters tend to write themselves if I just get them started. 




 You mean ' It are wisdom are irrefutable' 

I will show myself out. 




 You need to meet my wife, she had to do this exact thing. Congrats! You are on the right road. 




 That's awesome! Small steps and never give up! 

The power of the mind is an amazing thing. 




 There is a piece of me in every one of my works. My wife can find them easily, but a general reader would never know.  




 Congrats! Now on to the next 100k :-)  









 Oddly, I don't. But! I was looking through old photos and screen shots and saw this. Made me laugh, it was still in the good old days of WarCraft. 









 I will have to give it some thought. Down side to pushing it is the bad press, and do I want this guys phone number in one of my books if I have just taken him to court? 




 I can't agree more, that's why I was so surprised he agree'd to do it this way from day one. He even approached me in the beginning. I didn't search him out. Sucks. 




 I have the written emails, as well as the chat logs online. He changed his mind. Can't afford his price, can't afford a lawyer. 




 It was supposed to be for recognition only. His name would be on cover, with phone and contact info inside. 









 My wife and I have been together for over 9 years, she sounds a little like you. She didn't much care for my flirtatious behavior, but has learned that it is just my personality. She is the one for me, and always will be. I don't want anyone else.

You are off to a good start by expressing your feelings, now, take everything you just wrote down, and tell him that.

Even if you have to show him the post, or copy and paste and print it out for him. 

The words will do you more good if spoken to the right person.

If he is as good as you say he is, you will be fine, and you both with grow a bit and move on in your joint relationship. 

 




 I hit up one of my local writing groups once, I was the youngest there by about 20 years at least ( I am 40) they were all very nice, but not much into what I was looking for.  




 No. They said without evidence, it must be disregarded. Aka without evidence, it doesn't exist.  




 Were you born in the 1800's? 

If you can't see something...it must not exist? 




 Just because you don't believe in something, doesn't mean it's not real. No matter what religion you follow, there is a punishment for wrong. Unless you are agnostic, in that case, it wouldn't matter either way. 




 Good for you! -sorta- As far as the car is concerned, if you want to PM what parts you need, I may be able to help some. (I am in the business)  




 Go out, find someone out there that is worse off. Do something nice for them, ask them what they need right now, the most. Doesn't have to be big.

Here is the hard part.

While you are doing it, watch them. Watch their face, reactions, find the feelings you are missing inside you, in them. You might find a door inside yourself open just a bit. If it does, don't slam it shut. 

Do it again. 
























 Please look into the adoption route, if you are in Canada west coast feel free to PM me and I will offer any help I can. Heck, no matt where you are PM if you wish. 




 Your friend is beautiful. I see nothing wrong with her in any way.
 




 Your readers are smart people, they will understand the implications with very little input.  




 Your oil change is overdue... 









 History is written by the victors. Do you really think that they will honestly tell the entire truth, or the truth at all?  




 And there is a Montrose in Canada as well...BT we have the T-Rex here. 




 No, you can start on the last day, just have to type fast! 




 Hopefully my next one, I can see it in my head, I just need to get it made! 




 Even though I make less than 10 bucks a month from my writing, I still do it. Even have another book coming out next month. I love making the stories. If I make money one day? Great! If not...maybe my kids will proffit from it, or at least have something to remember me by. 

Either way, the stories will always continue. 




 Book one on Amazon is called Past Jumper. Would love to have your take on it.  




 Thank you! 

The first book is actually free on amazon right now, I am editing the last book (5) as we speak. :)  




 Time travel, shielding, flight, pyromania, healing unfortunately the world isn't sticking around long enough for any of it to last. 




 Thank you. Every one helps. 




 If you could also share my page on Facebook or any other media, I would be very appreciative.

 My mental capacity will degrade in the coming years, it's one way to leave something for my children, and perhaps they will reap some financing from it as well.  




 I remember. 




 So, nice pictures and all, but what books were you reading? Any chance one of them was one of mine? 




 This is the warning on the back of some very "offshore" lights that the store I work at has started selling. 

I feel like I am going to have a hard time standing behind this product. 









 As a general rule, linking your work like this is frowned on by Reddit. I speak from experience. You would do better to find another method of promotion.


And yes Anal? Is this supposed to be a XXX story? 




 So far the longest I have had published is at 96k. A touch under the majority, but I still think it's plenty. 
Have a few sitting at the 40-80k as well.  




 Yeah, no. 




 I read that as ponies...Still one you don't want to listen to.  




 Why is a good question. It keeps you sharp. 




 I auth - therefore I am... -er- 




 I am an author, insanity runs in my blood...and they let me out on a day pass...so back off!

;-)  




 If I couldn't control them, it would be very hard to type this from under a semi truck wheel... 




 That's why I started writing. At least computer time has a purpose now.  




 The consistant ones can be hard to ignore.  




 I am having a hard time thinking of a use for it...but it's better than none at all! 




 They are all mine, just the public and the not public sneak out sometimes.  




 This one! So much this one... 




 For instance, I was just walking down the street and a semi drove by really close. I thought, "Hmn, it would be super easy to dive under the wheels" Of course, that would be counter productive. But the thought was there. What random thoughts have popped into your head during the course of a day that are totally not your norm?

(I am by no means suicidal, it was just the thought.) 




 I will have to start squirreling away some money, thanks for the input. 




 The reason I have chosen to be an indie is that I am lacking in extra $. What I do have goes to debt, or bills. Spending more on promotion isn't an option. 




 I am an author. I have many books out and more coming soon, yet I am seriously lacking in the exposure side of my work.

Things I have done are:

- blog release
- tweets (many)
- Facebook promo (shares, promotions, giveaways, paid promotions)
- local promotion, friends, word of mouth.
- Reddit ( limited, self promotion is frowned on, I know)

I have the work, it's available, people like it, yet I am lacking in growing my reader base.

Anyone have some suggestions on things I might have missed? Or is this it for me? 




 I text them to my wife, no-one cares if you text things. 




 Yes, I need a trailer too. But, I still need my limbs. 




 I have had some very good experiences there. 
 




 Bring that photo over to r/redditgetsdrawn something tells me you will love what they do with it. 




 May 19 is my birthday. I will remember. 




 Just getting my flair! Yay for books! 




 Awesome. Thank you :-)  




 That's beautiful. Thank you very much. 




 Give it to ten complete strangers and tell them to be honest.

Once you have that feedback, look at getting it out the farther. Until then, go write another one.

 




 Great line of thinking, would make a very interesting story. I will have to keep this thought of yours in mind and see if anything developes.  




 If you are still giving out flairs, I would just love to have "Aspiring Author" as mine, but since I see it's not a choice, I would be happy to have "Mirror Thief" as my second choice. 

It's the title of my latest work. Mirror Thief.

And Mirror Thief, since advertisers say you have to say something at least three times for it to lodge in your long term memory. 

Thank you :-) 
 




 Normally around 1000 per hour, but when I get in the "zone" I have topped at about 1500. It helps when I am writing an action scene. Those go faster...

Hence why I try to write in a lot of action. 




 And I am glad you did. Thank you, it's awesome! 




 Love it! Thank you, and I see you snooped back a bit ;-) awesome. 




 Nope, and I thought someone would ask this sooner. It was all done and placed for me. I had no say. 
 




 Jetsons will never die! 
LONG LIVE ROSIE!  









 Very welcome, would always love to have another reader. 




 You got it.

 I will cross my fingers for you.  




 Ahh, I thought you had seen mine in it, sorry, I was confused. ;) 
 




 Bother. Do it, if you don't try you have already lost. 




 I will be looking into that asap, thank you. 




 Really? Pardon my ignorance, what is Books-A-Million? Do you have a link? 




 It all starts with one. :-)  




 That is a big deal too, thank you! 




 Thank you! 




 I did. It took a while to get it right, but in the end I used Createspace. After that it was a lot of personal contact, pushing my own sales and making friends with a lot of people. Sadly, you can't (normally) just write a book and hope it will get out there, you have to sell yourself as much as the work. 




 I find it interesting how I just posted a few days ago how my first novel, The Event, was written almost solely on my lunch breaks. It was the only time in my day I had nothing else to do but sit down.

 




 A couple years ago Amazon left my pricing alone, lately they have beef flip flopping it all over the place. 

Amazon will not inform you when they change the price, you have to watch it yourself, constantly, and it's an incredible struggle to get them to put it back. You lose almost all your rights when you sign up with them. 

I may consider sending that email. Communications with them about my work have been a little painful in the past, but thank you for the suggestion. 




 E-book pricing is generally lower than print book pricing. Yet Amazon takes a larger cut on e-book, so you have to decide to make far less, or raise your price some to compensate.

You get to start the pricing where you like it, but Amazon will change it with no notice to you. I believe you print version doesn't change the e-book versions pricing data all. 




 Thank you! If you like, I have some free works up on Amazon to pass your time with.  




 The joys of being forced to work with Amazon. They control the price structure. To make anything on it at all you have to mark it up, so when they choose to mark it back down for you, it's close to where you wanted it in the first place.

I am showing it at 160 pages though. (Paperback) Don't know why the kindle version is listing it at 111... 




 Huh, front page yesterday...Repost today... 




 Yeah, that's cool. I like that one.  




 Advice...Keep trying, if all else fails, try again. When that fails, try again. 


You are your own worst critic.


And lastly, 


Trust in yourself, and never stop promoting.  




 If you are interested in taking a look at what it is about, please feel free to look it up on Amazon. 









 My first real paper book is available in a real book store. And I am happy to share shelf space with other great authors like Brandon Sanderson and Amanda Hocking. 




 Yeah, the side bar said not to though. I try to be good even if I want to shout READ MY BOOKS! from the rooftops. 

I have been told that isn't very classy. 




 Mine is Mirror Thief, and I am sharing space with Brandon Sanderson. :-) 

Was trying to NOT turn my joy into shameless self promotion. But so be it! 
 









 Losing your walls can be a great way to move on. 

Everybody hurts. 




 Was my first thought...gunna crash back into someone's back yard. 




 Two years during lunch breaks at work on the first one. Bout four months on the second. Many other short stories and long ones started-finished in between. 

Come to think of it, I have way too many stories going on right now. 




 Yes, except I have pretty much gone full indie, so not exceptionally good there... 




 Finding a beta reader who will be honest with you can be a true challenge. It helps if you have no personal connection with the person yet still value their opinion. 

If you do happen to come across a person that fits this bill, you also have to remember that their opinion might not match the masses. That's where you have o go find another 5 of these people and compare all the notes. If they all agree, you have a problem. 

That's why sometimes people just decide to pay people to do it. It's a faster way to the same end. 

That being said, most people, like myself, can't afford to pay people. So when you do get a core group of beta's keep them close to your heart, their input can be immeserable. 




 Maybe we need to get some cross promoting going, hey, every post counts! 




 A caf I can understand, but I sell car parts now...lunch rush isn't related. Sometimes I dream of an office-cubicle job where everyone ignores you. Or for one of my books to take off, either would be nice. 




 And it's always around 11-3 or what we call, eat your lunch cold time. 




 I swear they just mill around waiting for a predetermined time to all rush in at the same time. 


It's a conspiracy... 




 I have been working the same job for 19 years. If I didn't have my family, and my writing, I don't know what I would have done. If you can find a way to get out, do it.  




 What gave it away ;-)  




 If the customers would just stop coming in, I would have so much more free time...but they don't.  




 *this or
Angel...always loved that show. 




 I have a collection of short that is up for free. It has hit the top 100 on amazon a few times. 

Before I put them for free they rarely sold at all. I can't say that they help my other works, but people do give them great reviews. Maybe in time the other stories will start selling better.  




 During the day I help people diagnose and fix cars while giving them the best deals on parts. During the night I am a superhero...or I write stories...one of those is a lie. 




 Incredible! Thank you! 




 Already...That is a win! Love it so far thank you! 









 Sadly, self editing is almost impossible. 

I know.

And I am so stubborn I keep trying to do it anyway. 




 I'm sure there is a reason, or I need to dust off some of those stories I haven't finished and get them up for sale asap! 




 Am I reading this wrong, you book is on sale for 4.99, yet it's only %10 done? 




 Glad to be of help. 




 It's not that hard as long as you work the scenes well. Be clear on your transitions and split the fight only when necc. It wouldn't hurt to have a reason why you shift, a loud noise, or an object moving from inside to out. A thrown chair perhaps? Give the reader a reason to shift from one to another. 




 POV first. I would start with the inside one for ease of structure. Who is seeing it? Are you in third person? How does it start. 

Writing fight scenes isn't that much different from any other scene, with the exception of how much detail to pour in. You don't need to describe the sound his knuckles made as they impacted his front teeth for instance.

Work with your characters, pay attention to the flow and let them tell you what is happening next. Describe that to your reader, and you will have your fight scene.

If that doesn't work. Call over a friend and have them act it out for you while you scribble furiously.  




 Touchy subject much? 




 Bump? Really? This isn't a FB post on a buy and sell... 




 If you ever decide to start writing proffesionally, let me know. I would love to work with you on something one day. 




 You forgot to mention the poop. 









 My son asked me at bedtime, "How much money do you have?"
I have always done my best to be honest with my kids, so I answered honestly, "About $70."
His response was, "How do we live?"

Pretty deep for a 6 year old. 

I work my 8-5 and it pays the bills. I have the dept, same as almost everyone else. I try to pull in money for my family on the side, when I can, yet there is never enough. I write books, my wife cleans peoples shitty houses. We are always living one paycheck to another.

There is never enough.

And I am getting tired of being broke.

I want to throw off my chains of my adult freedom. Yet, I wouldn't give up my life for anything.
 




 I have know a lot of pretty faced women who were very ugly on the inside. If you are truly a beautiful soul you need only wait and the right guy will find you. 

Just be sure you don't trap yourself in your own failing by looking at only the exteriors of the men around you. 
























 It's the clarity of communication. 

Sure we can write - u r da best at or job - and you will understand what I am saying, however it does take a second to process. The same happens when you switch your and you're, sure your mind can figure it out but it pulls you from the moment.  




 Easy yes, generally profitable...no.
I am having one of the best months ever though.

If you can afford it, pay the editor. 




 Look into medications then. Usually there is a reason for behavior like this. And the go to answer is often some kind of chemical imbalance.  




 Is he messing with any drugs? 
Paranoia is a pretty common side effect for plenty of narcotics.  




 I must dropped the price of one of my works as a bonus with the release of my latest book coming this week. Does that count?

Usually they don't drop because of the cost to make and distribute books. If you look into the profit an author makes with each sale you will find the majority are less than a dollar per book. Even at a sale price of twenty dollars.  




 I just reduced the price on my e-book, The Event, if you are interested. It was my first full length novel with a dark side. And I have the full collection of -Future Jumper Series- coming out this week. E-book and print. 

What are you writing? Anything you care to share? 




 Or  a really small man... 




 You might want to take a look at The Event. While I admit I am biased, I did write it with one thought in mind, what if the hero doesn't win?  




 I have 11 titles under my name atm.  




 Books! Course, I write books so I am biased. 




 Very welcome. If you have problems with formating or anything, let me know. 




 Right are all yours. You can publish elsewhere, but if you do read their rules. You might have minor conflicts with some promo offers (Amazon's KDP for instance). No legal issues that I have ever heard of. 




 Www.smashwords.com is your best bet.  




 Reposting something from the front page? #nononono 




 Feel free to add me as a friend here, I will be sure to post it up, or if you wish, pm and I will share my FB writing page with you so you can follow my updates there :-) 




 Book 1 of 5 Free to all! If you like this start to a much larger tale, please take a look for the next 4 books available now on Amazon under the Future Jumper titles. 









 Check out some trailers, or even game play footage. You will be shocked.  




 Yes. 
That being said, it's one of the best games I have played since I was a kid. It brought back the fear of death in a game. 
The risk vs reward.
I crawled around corners, sword in hand and held my breath in the dark.
I count the days till #3 is released.  




 Dark/Demon Souls. You need to play those. Need. To.  




 I am waiting on Amazon to link my books. Sometimes they are as fast as a few hours. Other times, days...I do have some freebies available now if you are interested in checking out some of my writing.  




 It  should have been free. Sorry, I was offline for the remainder of the promo. I will be doing another give away soon so please keep an eye out for it. Feel free to PM on reddit and I will link you to my FB page!  




 Thank you :) They are some of my pretty early works. I can honestly say my writing has only improved since then. 




 Mirror thief. At the end of his rope, Dario finds out he can enter the world inside of a mirro. Now with his new found skill, will he use his power for good or? 




 I will toot my own horn a second. The event is on Amazon, and I plan to have it on matchbook soon. It is a post apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy. 




 Thank you everyone for helping me reach #1 in time travel category! I hope you all got a chance to grab these stories. 




 Just heading to bed, have to work in the AM, but here is a link to the paperback cover coming out this month

http://jamieheppner.blogspot.ca/2013/12/worlds-unbound-cover-release.html 

The blurb on the back does a good job of summing up the 5 independant books.

 




 Free starts at midnight tonight. (Pacific time) Didn't want anyone to miss out, so I have posted a touch early. 

If you still have problems after that, please let me know.  









 Thank. You have your downvote button. Yet you keep coming back... 




 If you are interested in getting to know the person who helped create these works, her reddit username is http://www.reddit.com/user/DanielleDrake/
And I have her permission to post this! 
Thank you for taking a minute to look.  









 I am right there with you. No better time to start than now! 




 Never! It's a challenge!  




 Happy New Year! 









 Damn, your sales are exactly the same as mine! 




 I would say be happy you even got a match. I got nothing at all, no match, Nada. 




 Can't agree more...and even more awkward honeymoon...  




 I am unsure what you are trying to show here?  




 In that order? 




 No,  you have a valid point, and I can see what you mean. I will try to twist it a touch... 




 My wife baked cookies. 
Can't say it worked, but we sold it to that same lady. She told us it "Just felt like a good family home."
 




 Missed the double light. That's bad...
You are right about Francis's line. Didn't sit right with me either, so I am glad to see it wasn't just me. 

I don't care for the last tag line. It did feel...forced. But the worlds unbound needs to be in there somewhere. 




 Jump(ed) removed.

Fire (is) added. 

Have been pointed out to me. Any others?  




 Reddit, you have all been incredibly helpful to me with the work I am doing on may latest book. If I could impose, one more time, on your good graces. Please, take a look at this and simply answer, would you buy this book, or does something in the blurb turn you off.


It started with science, and ended the earth.


Aiden and Jess thought they were only doing experiments with light. They had no idea what would happen when they broke the speed of light while bouncing a laser off the moon. 


Using jumps through time Aiden tried to fix what he broke and save humanity, only to draw others into his ruined future. Each jumped pulled another victim caught in Aiden's bubbles of time.


Jane, her life of torment driving her to suicide.

Casey, an adventure seeker, living life for the thrills.

Francis, always on the run, fire her closest friend.

And Aiden's girlfriend Jess, the reason for him to continue trying even after humanity turns against him.


In this, the finale of the Past Jumper series we find out if Aiden can break out of his cycle, or will the worlds become forever unbound.
 




 They look like a variant of the PH3614 standard fram. So, if it's correct, you have a bunch of import filters, Honda, Toyota stuff like that. From.com might help more. 




 As a follow up, if you are really that hard up for material, pm me, I will send you an e-book for free. Might as well have someone read something. 




 As a struggling author. Damn you.

There is no free. There is pirated. What you are looking for us against the law. There are free things out there, you can find them easily, because they are meant to be found. Hit up amazon, look for free audiobooks. 

If you are at pirate(anything).org or any extension, you are stealing, from authors, like me.

 Sunshine.
Warm beaches.
 




 Drunk, dancing with a very beautiful woman on a tabletop, waiting for the lights to go out. 




 The world ended with a whimper, nothing was said about the final inhabitant. 




 Learning cloning technology, and saving dna samples.  




 I signed up for secret santa. I was really looking forward to it. Kinda like way back in grade school when you got to write a letter to someone in another country. It was a good feeling for a time. As Christmas got closer I forgot I had signed up, until later and I noticed I had never gotten an address, a name, anything.

I know I got a confirmation when I signed up, but nothing came for me to send to. 

I am disappointed, I really wanted to put a smile on some strangers face, yet for some reason that I don't know, I wasn't allowed.

I find myself angry, yet I can't explain why. I shouldn't be. I have no reason to be. I just am. 




 Did you have caps lock or scroll lock on? 
Try turning them off... 




 In my work, electricity as we know it completely stops working all together. 

Has a rather profound effect on humanity as we know it. 

Throw in some fantasy and boom. You have an epic read. 




 I used an unknown solar flare resetting the entire earth to pre-history times. It worked for my book. And if you do some research in the sun's history, you would be surprised at how easily it could kill us all.

 You asked how to get viruses off your friends computer and how to reset your computer. 2 different computers. So yes, press the any button next. It's right under the easy button. 




 Use the reset button on your computer, your friends computer is going to need a lot more work though. 
 




 As a man who has been bitten in the past, leave now. If there isn't a way to spend time in the same room as this person, everything you "know" could be a lie. 

I was used and abused for almost a year by a friend I fell for, in the end she was married and her husband and her were using me for personal entertainment.

Cut your losses, move on, find a person who you can see in front of you, smile with, hold hands, and talk to. 




 Well we do have good health care. However, just being up here doesn't make everything better. 

I tore a ligament in my shoulder and it still took over 2 years to get fixed.
If it's just for the health care alone, you might want to look very closely. If you are that hard up, getting a job up here might be tough. Unless of course you are already wealthy. 
 




 As a Canadian, yes. Of course, why would you want to? Isn't that a decision that you should be making from your own point of view? 




 I couldn't resist throwing that in there.  









 You have to DL to watch this? BOO! 




 Blood...She wanted more. 




 It was a strange experience. The minute the helicopter lifted off and left me behind, the entire island went silent.


I could still see the mainland from where I was left on the beach. The white sand disappeared into the starlight blue of the ocean. They told me before they left I shouldn't try swimming for it. I might make it a few hundred feet before the sharks got me. Almost at command, I watched a fin break the surface a moment before silently dipping back below to the depths. With a gulp, I turned back towards my goal, my future, my death.


The sands stretched out in front of me to the line of trees that seemed impenetrable. This was insane, yet given the options it was the only choice I could take.


In a moment of clarity, I remembered the magistrate standing above me as he passed sentence.


"You have been given the black ticket. For your crimes, you have the choice of a swift death now, or the opportunity to earn your freedom on exclusion."
"Exclusion."
I had stammered the word before I could think about what I was agreeing to.


Now I was left to fight against the islands turmoil of genetically modified animals, and twist one into submission, or die trying.


The simple blade they had supplied me with felt heavy in my hands as I willed my feet to move me to the tree line. It wasn't a choice. Death was rumored to live at every bend on this island. The animals here were the remnants of the gene splicing experiments of 2078.


The activists had insisted that the animals not be killed, yet they were entirely too dangerous to be let loose where people could be harmed. This was the compromise. If only the activists knew what the government was doing now. They would shit themselves.


The worst offenders like myself were given the option to try to tame an animal or die trying. I had heard one woman had done it. Yet, rumors were she didn't live long after. If it was the government that had gotten rid of her, or her pet, no one in the prison could tell me for sure.


A branch broke under my foot sending a single shot of noise through the underbrush. Fuck. My palms started to sweat around the synthetic leather grip of the knife. Cows had been extinct for twenty years. Real leather was too expensive to waste on a dead convict.


I scanned the area to see if anything had heard my mistake and only silence came back in response. As I waited for my heart rate to slow, I saw a flicker of movement off to my side. I twisted my head around and was rewarded with the source of the movement.


A squirrel sat on a log stone still and stared at me with tiny black eyes.
I couldn't believe my luck. Since the majority of dogs had died out in the poisoned air sweep of 2029 people had taken to smaller animals as pets. Squirrels had proved remarkably easy to tame, and the new market they created had swept the world with an entirely new field of clothing, toys, and habitats. They were all custom made to fill the void left behind in the pet field. If I was going to have any chance at getting off this island alive, it was sitting right in front of me, right now.


A quick survey of the ground around me left me with a tiny selection of berries and seeds. The guide had mentioned that food was plentiful here. It was a minor shock to see how plentiful. In a passing thought, I wondered why it would be like this with so many animals around, but with a mental shrug, I dismissed the notion, it wasn't important. Taming this squirrel was important.


Careful not to spook him away I first placed a berry on my hand and held it out to him. I watched for a reaction as I carefully stretched my hand forward. Only a gentle twist of the animals head came in response. I dropped the berry and tried a nut hoping for a more favorable result.


With each item I presented, the squirrel only gave a minor shift of his head, not a negative twist, more of a curiosity. Perspiration built up on my forehead as I presented item after item.


It didn't work. I felt my legs start to shake from sitting still for so long and I stared at the squirrel on the log in front of me. In frustration, I broke the silence and cursed the fuzzy fiend.
"What the hell do you eat you little bastard!"
With uncanny speed, he shot forward and bit the tip of my outstretched hand. My leg muscles convulsed as I fell to the side. A tiny drip of blood pooled on my fingertip where the rodent's teeth had broken my skin. The world around me went out of focus as I watched the deep red turn to a purple and then a black.


I tried to move away, but my body wouldn't listen to my mind. I tried to scream, but no words escaped my lungs. Before my eyes completely glazed over I saw the tiny black eyes of the squirrel stare at me from on top of that log. Moments later another pair, and then another had joined it.


As I fell to the ground with a dull thump, I understood why the squirrel didn't except any of my offerings, and that's why food was so plentiful on the island. They didn't eat any of it.
 




 I made so many maps in my youth, it was part of what made the games so fun. I used to keep a binder full of them. Fantasy Star was one I believe, I mapped the entire end dungeon. 




 I handed my controller to my 6 yr old son, and showed him what button to push, he won every fight.  




 You are very welcome! And I think I have it pretty nailed down. I am getting good feedback here, as well as on my professional page on FB. People really like that one.  




 I don't mind at all. However in this instance the lady has some more effects that flip over to the back cover. This sample doesn't show the other side since I was just working on my e-book cover first. 

It does look good, all though somewhat pixelated...any practice is good practice though!  




 Awesome suggestions, thank you. I will really consider this before the final draft. 




 The girl, and the fire, are pivotal in this, the final chapter of the series.

The by has been removed, however I am still working on the cropping. It may (will?) end up as a paperback as well, so the cover image you see has her hand sweeping to the left and an open black area for the blurb placement. I have been playing with fonts, but as of yet I am unable to find one that truly seems to flow. It has been offered I should use a fire, but that...would be too much. 

As for the series # I don't have much choice. I have had too many readers pick up a book out of order and than leave a negative review because it didn't make any sense. If I don't hit a reader in the face with what book number it is, well...

Thank you for your input, it is consistent with almost everything else that I have heard. I will repost a finished product in an update as soon as it is done. Hopefully to better praise!  




 Again, it doesn't apply, but you were honest in your answer...so TADA! 

http://y2jgfx.deviantart.com/art/Randy-Orton-Man-On-Fire-161569370 




 As of right now. No...but you know what...that's an interesting idea. 

It doesn't tie in with the female character that has an affinity for fire...but there is a strong male character who controls the wind. 

I might have to think on that one. Thank you!  









 It is strong choice for many, the one with a human model looked great in my mind, I just couldn't get it to work on the screen. The silhouette sample works as she is blowing fire onto the back cover but the front would be solo for e-book version.

Thank you for your input! 




 Here are the 3 samples I have so far. I have the left images hidden since they don't really need to be shown at this stage. 

What do you think? Suggestions? Ideas? Anything you would change on them? All input welcome.  









 Now #1 in the Time category and in the top 2000 for free! 

Thank you everyone for helping get the word out.  




 You have mail! ;) Enjoy!  




 You are very welcome. I have had fun writing the series.  




 What country? Amazon has some funky rules. I will send you a PDF if you PM me.  









 I don't think so. Just for fun and to learn to plan ahead. My son is showing some decent skills considering he is only six. 









 No, that would be stupid, now wouldn't it.

 I walk past a funeral home every once in a while. I don't know why, but this poem came into my head today and I just had to write it somewhere. 

Thank you for reading taking the time to read it. 




 I do not lie here, this is not me.

I will let you know how the next one goes, I started it four years ago, just picking it up again...who knows, maybe it will be next year?!?! 




 My first book, yes. Two to be exact. 

My second, no, four months.

My third, it's just been finished and took over two years again. 

So...yes, and no.  




 My best friend Plank. It's an old funny video. 









 I switch between them as the story unfolds. It can be done very easily as long as you make the POV shift clear. If you don't you run the risk of confusing your reader base. If you have to, start a new chapter each time and place an identifier as soon as you start the new chapter. 




 I have a story titled The Event, doesn't tell much, just enough.
