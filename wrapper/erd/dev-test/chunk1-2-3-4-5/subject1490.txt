 Whenever, already added you
 




 Appreciate!  




 Would you possibly be able to help me evolve my Seadra?
 




 Cool no hurry. Do you have perchance have Kyorgre?
 




 I can do a tradeback for Diancie  




 Awesome thanks man! I forgot about the tradeback.. super baked
*edit wait that wasn't even you... my bad....
 




 Cool cool, just out of curiosity what is it that the natures do? Sorry I haven't played pokemon since gen 2 prior to this game lol. 




 I have an Adamant Oshawott but my Fennikin is Naughty, is that alright?
 




 By sheer luck I actually have both of those in the few random extras I have bred!  




 [trade] I have all starters (all gens) and most of the Hoenn Pokedex. Also need a tradeback for my Seadra. Thanks! 




 LOL I have similar memories! 




 Hey sorry I went ark for a bit but if you're still around I could actually use one! Thanks.
 




 Thanks a ton mate! Really helped me out :)
 




 Whenever you're ready
 




 K just give me a bit to hatch it :) Sorry just multi-tasking up the waazoo right now lol
 




 Absolutely that's fine! I'll send over some random level 1's then.
 




 Sure just give me a few to breed an extra
 




 Thanks man! I appreciate it. :)
 




 added you! Don't see you on PSS though.
 




 Awesome thanks mate! What would you like in return?
 




 Thanks! Still after Lunatone, Seviper, Wigglytuff and Lileep. I think most of those are AS exclusive except the Lileep dual type fossil, which I took the opposite of.
 




 Phione takes foreeeever to hatch :P
 




 I can get you Kabuto I'd just have breed one real quick haha sorry! If time is no issue it's not a problem.
 




 For sure! I have an extra Tyrunt on hand, just gotta breed the Phione.  




 [trade] Alright so I need a bunch of pokemon for my Hoenn pokedex. I'm willing to trade pretty much whatever, I have almost all of the Hoenn pokedex minus this handful. I also have every starter from every generation.

Some other notables up for trade: 
Tyrunt
Anorith
Kabuto
Phione

Thanks :)
 




 Shit thanks mate! This was my first time participating in a giveaway and you my friend have made it tops! 
 




 Not even the weirdest thing about this picture.. 




 I would be willing to argue that most people here are actually aware that it's a blanket...you're kinda missing the point. 




 If it were a colour picture I bet it would look normal... just the contrast in black and white photos that makes things look unnatural. That said, this definitely belongs here. Weird photo composition as well, with her way out to the right of the frame facing away...  




 K then deposited. :)
 




 Okay, about to deposit a level 15 male Slugma. I can't gender lock, but I did level lock. Sorry i'm a noob to gts - do I need to fill in the pokemon wanted section? 




 aka every pokemon i'm not actively trying to catch. 




 Badass! The texture makes it seem almost as though it's made of stone. Either way, very good looking Blastoise!  




 I miss this emulator :( I updated iOS and now it no longer works. My FR team wuz the shit :( 




 Hmmm I just got all this free stuff from my loving family... I better go complain about it on the internet now. 




 Good to know man, glad to have you on my list :)
 




 None really come to mind, I'm sure there are lots but I only do a couple at a time, takin' it slowly.
 




 Thanks a lot man! Merry Christmas!
 




 k
 




 sure!
 




 thanks man!
 




 [trade] Yeah so I need a Lotad to help complete my pokedex. Going in systematic order now that i'm done the game. I do have every starter from every generation though if somebody wants one for the trade.  




 Because sleep is for the weak and I am an internet addict. True story.
 




 Thanks a lot man! Hopefully you'll be around when I finally get my Electrizer and Magmarizer :)
 




 [tradeback] Yeah so I basically just need help evolving these three via trade. If you don't have them already it will be for dex entries or if you do you could just help a fellow trainer out. The Clamperl will be evolving into Gorebyss.  




 Yooo sorry man I totally replied and then went and did shit thinking you weren't gonna be on! Anyway i'm around now. 




 Hey man sorry passed out last night, I still need a Chespin though if you're offering. What would you like in return? I have literally every other starter. (except Fennekin, have it but in a different game)
 




 Thanks for the trade man! Now all I have left is Chespin...that one will be tough haha. Not much love for that little guy.. 




 I added you, you still need to add me though so that it's mutual. Just enter in my friend code in the friends app and i'll initiate the trade, it's done through PSS 




 Kk I still need Oshawott, Got Froakie now
 




 haha sweet :) i don't even know what that is lol. I would have taken literally anything.
Thanks for the trade mate!
 




 damn how'd you lose your everstone?
 




 Nice third choice! :) Thanks for the trade mate.
 




 Can do :) have extras of all
 




 Cool sounds good, I literally just got froakie in a wonder trade hahah but yeah np just send over whatever along with the chimchar egg 




 Yeah man that would be great, and I can trade you all three of those of you want. They're all gonna be level 1 tho haha
 




 [trade] So yeah i'm looking to complete my Hoenn pokedex and I also want to get all the starters eventually so I'm looking for the ones mentioned in the title as well as Chespin and Froakie if anyone has em. Not picky about level or stats or whatever.

Can trade any of the original Gen I or II starters plus Snivvy, Piplup, Tepig and Turtwig. 

Thanks. :)
 




 I'm assuming it's done now... didn't get any but helped get a few new dex entries!
 




 Chances are i'll be sleeping by then but i'm not in a rush and if you're going out of your way to offer them free I can just wait until whenever's convenient for both of us. I'll add you tho 




 Yeah that sounds good, Try me whenever you're on, I'll probably be awake.
 




 for sure!
 




 gotcha. so in 15~min?
 




 Sorry i'm a noob to the Pokemon Reddit community, how do these work? 




 [trade] So i'm looking for Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander. I have for trade any of the following, bred from an egg level 1:
Snivvy
Piplup
Chikorita
Treecko

Also I have an extra ditto.

Thanks! 

Ps if you happen to have Totodile or Cyndaquil and want to trade for any of the above, that works too!  
























 ps your flooring is dope
 




 Nice one man! love the tv in front of the trainer lol. I have a similar setup for those long seshes! 




 You need to start living my friend
 




 I feel like this is when a large tv becomes useful
 




 Ayy you just read my mind. 




 I also think its more just to do with all the similar titles lately. Nice setup man!
 




 Alright, fair enough. He's not driving under their bedroom windows at night, I get that.

Just a weird teacher with some questionable social media practices.  




 At the basic level you are right: don't post shit you don't want others to see. But the issue here is more what an incredible display of unprofessionalism it is to monitor your students online presence unsolicited. And the fact that OP is clearly not aware of how negatively his actions are actually being perceived by anyone whose opinion is actually relevant to the scenario.  

 




 Wow nothing personal but I kinda hope you get fired. Sounds like you're not exactly cut out to be teaching kids when you yourself aren't finished being one.

You said you take "pride" in being in the know about your students, when in fact you are just monitoring their presence online without their permission or the official request of anybody. The fact that you admitted to needing to find out "who liked the girls ass photo" already betrays your creepy personal agenda.

Justify it however you want but you teachers who stalk students are the fucking worst. 




 I initially read it as a female teacher telling the story and still thought it was creepy as fuck. He literally applies the word "stalking" to what he is doing to his students. Nobody asked him to do that shit. At best he's well intentioned but needs to get a life, at worst he gets kicks out of following his students lives and still needs to get his own. 




 lol nice one! love the shadow being cast by your collectible  




 fuckin' dopee
 




 Seriously does it go back hundreds of years because of cultural tradition, or did it just start with a couple of furry animators and kind of snowballed from there?

I just find it so strange that bestiality is typically regarded as one of the most taboo forms of pornography, yet humans who dress and act (and in some cases even want to be treated) like cats are noticeably becoming more and more mainstream and acceptable, especially in Japan and amongst Japanese pop-culture enthusiasts. Why is this?
  




 Sometimes when I feel shitty about not going out I remember this is some peoples idea of a public outing and I feel much better. 




 Yeahhhh 




 lol ever heard of a bag?
you must be one of those dorks with saggy weighted down cargo pants
 




 just described my sleep habits
 




 lol I like how it's barren... Romans don't like snow

edit: nvm I think I see people just the resolution makes it hard to tell
 




 I feel like you haven't actually seen one then
 




 1   2 will always hold a special place in my heart. Still played 3 but didn't love it. Age of Mythology is still the shit too, bust it out a couple times annually for some comp stomp
  









 Club mate! luckyyyy. Can't get that shit at all in Canada. 
 




 Triple reddit?
 




 How do you run three monitors off of one laptop? is there any lag?
 




 I feel like shopping will never become 100% online because sometimes there are things you just don't want to wait for. I don't mind buying the odd jacket or whatever online but i'm not going to have a wardrobe shipped to me. If there are people like that out there that is weird..
 




 Here in Edmonton we still have ridiculously over the top malls. Case and point: West Edmonton Mall.  




 West Edmonton Mall is actually one of the few exceptions with a ton of attractions left. It still has an ice rink, amusement park, water park, arcade, iMax movie theatre, replica ship in the middle of a big flooded atrium that you can book for parties, and multiple mini-putt courses. Plus a hotel, nightclubs, casino, bowling and several sit-down restaurants. The only thing missing is a strip joint. But yeah besides that all our malls are pretty cookie-cutter. H M, VS, Starbucks, etc.

 Also idk why but I like chaotic battle stations like this as opposed to clean ones. Clean looks nice but also like they just moved into the room and then took the picture. I like a battlestation that's clearly been lived in and has evolved to fit the space rather than the other way around.  




 I'd love to have a tv parallel to the bed like that for those lazy mornings...
 




 I gagged
 




 Is the wife is cool with you splitting your time between your marriage bed and a gaming shack?
 




 Do you work at home? What kind of job would you need Rokit 8's for?
 




 My dream is to one day have enough desk space to have a perfect clean triple monitor setup like this....
 




 Those are some odd choices for discreet weapons
 




 I see a controller but no speakers o.o
 




 2 decks is so last decade
 




 So much asian in this pic
 




 Nice setup but it seems pretty spread out for live production 




 :(
 




 "make you" as in give you away. If someone undercover is "made" it means he's compromised. Poor word choice in hindsight.

 




 Back in the late 2000's almost every phone had terrible interference and sometimes you'd be sitting in class (middle school at the time) and when a text came through the radio interference would make you and the teacher would come take your phone away.. 




 I actually thought it was Felicia Day for a second... 




 Yo man your wife looks like Felicia Day... lucky guy.
*edit...Forgot this was posted in a sub specifically for women, assuming now that OP is in fact Felicia Day lookalike..
 




 Reminds me of "Sorry" a Wurmple I got from OT: Ashes Mom
 




 Sorry if this has already been posted and sorry for the quality of the video (There are newer uploads but the original is the only one with english subtitles - plus the shitty translation adds to the humour imo)

Anyways one of my earliest and best stoner memories is getting high for one of the first times and then stumbling across this video with a friend. Since we were both kinda nerdy we understood most of the references and sound clips, and it just made for an awesome random experience when I was young and new to the herb. Germans and I would get along apparently.  









 Alright cheers mate!
 




 Oooh yeah, that must have been it. I don't think you can get the primal evolutions in it and I had mine holding the mega stone. Want to try again? 




 Yeah not working :( says "There is a pokemon that cannot be traded in your party" even though it's not in my party in the first place. 




 Here lets try again, if it doesn't work i'll just send over whatever. Weird though, I literally just traded it  




 Weird it's not letting me trade him all of the sudden...
 




 Awesome! Last one I need. Any particular mon you want? 




 Thanks!
 




 Sounds good 




 Got it now, thanks for the offer though. :) 




 yup! Any dex entries you need in return?
 




 No, thank you! :)
 




 K sorry got distracted! Added you though.
 




 kk! Add you in a sec
 




 How do people usually go about doing that? Just let me know when you've caught it on here so we can do the tradeback after I guess.
 




 Sure man
 




 [tradeback] Yeah so i'm just looking for these last few to complete my dex. I've given up on a semi-living dex, just interested in having the little pokeball next to em' now.

LF: ~~Milotic~~, Huntail, ~~Rhyperior~~, ~~Jirchi~~, ~~Glalie~~, ~~Froslass~~

I have all of the OR exclusive legendaries and all of the starters available for dex entries. Thanks for the help! I could never have even got this far without this subreddit.

 




 I don't but if you still do I definitely could. Also I hate to be petty but I accidentally traded you my everstone lol
 
























 same here, dream-home material for sure
 




 sick reference 
 




 Genocide is the systematic elimination of a specific group of homogenous people who share a common characteristic. Not at all similar.

 Is this your first time dealing with human emotions? Fearing for our own mortality is a regular occurrence and has been for millennia. 




 Sorry, guess I'm unbalanced for being a little disturbed by the possibility of mass murder 




 I could see using a vertical monitor for plugins but it definitely doesn't make much sense for arrangement view 




 great selection mate!
 
 




 Very nice setup! Photo seems a tad bit contrived, like you're trying to show off all your cool hobbies at once. Or maybe you do just juggle producing, browsing, streaming and programming all at once. Either way cool rig man.  




 I kept holding out hoping for a less fucked up answer... but even I can no longer deny this seems like a mass murder/suicide :( 




 I've read more than a few comments to the effect of "I hope that scumbag murderer co-pilot rots in hell." Don't underestimate the ability some possess to rapidly condemn strangers to hell based on pure speculation.

Nothing wrong with harmless and educated speculation, but some definitely take it too far once they've made their premature opinion. 




 All these americans going "In the US we...." are soooo helpful  

 




 Cracked front windshield, cockpit depressurizes while the one pilot steps out, co-pilot starts emergency descent but then passes out in cockpit from hypoxia, pilot either can't get back in for whatever reason or does eventually get back in but then also passes out..plane continues unguided emergency descent into mountain
  




 There is still the possibility that even after the locked-out pilot regained emergency access, whatever incapacitated the co-pilot got to him soon after. Think about it... if it was a cracked front windshield causing depressurization leading to hypoxia like experts are now hypothesizing, merely regaining access to the cockpit wouldn't be enough to save the plane. It would likely just lead to more incapacitated people. 




 You're telling a recently deceased man to rot in hell before you even know he's guilty of anything? Fucked up dude. It still could have been lots of other things. Speculation now is that a cockpit windshield pane could have cracked, causing depressurization and knocking out those in the cockpit. 
 




 "Like exactly what I like or you're just a noob lolz"

Seriously though, I love Ducky but objectively, they aren't even well designed keycaps. The designer literally just made a bunch of jagged lines for the "cityscape" with the pen tool in Illustrator then plopped a monument or two in each depending on the city. And everyone still loses their shit over it. 
 




 Love it! Definitely reminds me of Unreal Tournament's soundtrack
 




 My other bike is a bike.
 









 Nice web, Mr. crackspider.  




 Sorry nooby question maybe but whats the thing on top of the Marshal? looks interesting
 




 nice man I figured from the setup you did something techno-y and your soundcloud didn't disappoint.
 




 B W filter and you've got yourself a Techno album cover 




 dude I looove these! 
 




 First thing I thought was PRIDE
 




 Korg Nanokey or MPK Mini's are great for le plane  




 Lots of classical music is what gets me. Stuff by guys like Ludovico Einaudi or Yiruma. Idk why..

I find the darkest of atrophic, nihilistic berlin techno to be more happy than that shit.

 




 Nice one man
 




 I'm a design student with limited extra cash for designer clothes (go figure) so I tend to wear a lot of plain, cheap dark clothes (plain black v's, drop crotch sweats, black slim fit jeans, black converse/high tops, dark scarves) and cheapish techy outerwear (think Superdry). If I had the money, I'd be decked out in DEMOBAZA, Rick Owens, and a Google Glass tho LOL..
 




 Edmonton, AB! New to this sub but long time lover of dark things so I feel right at home :)
 




 I think it's usually an indirect way of letting everybody know "I would have even more cool stuff if my money didn't all go to books/bars/subway"

At least that's why I would mention that i'm still in school.

 




 Soundcloud is the way to go my friend! Join a group or find a few artists you like and go from there. Most artists have contact/booking info right on their profile. It's really easy when you can see the likes of your favourite artist, just follow the trail to new stuff.

 




 oh Russia...
 




 nice but definitely not original. We actually learned how to use the pen tool recreating vector lotuses just like this at my school.  









 Woah! I've been using this as an avatar on a random music forum for years now. Cool to finally know the source. I think I originally found it on tumblr.

 




 Great photo! Made me hungry for some reason...
 




 Music producer and graphic designer... Wanna be my best friend? 




 oh yeah...wow, how about that?
 




 Love it :)
 




 more like hikikomori stations. The second last one made me laugh tho. Some 4channer eating frozen yogurt up in a crawlspace.  




 I lost it when I saw the calculator!
 




 Honestly probably not a whole lot, but they exist for the same reason luxury vehicles and $5000 suits exist. People like nice things. :)
 




 Oh man those are soo gorgeous.
 




 First thing I saw too
 




 zoomed in on the sticker set thinking it was something super cool..
 




 Also I LOVE the framed Starcraft race emblems!  




 I want to go PLP too but then i'd be covering up my monitors :( small desk/room problems..

Anyway nice setup, just made some student jealous ;)
 




 Hello, welcome to Gamestop....
 




 I love this! Simple and understated but you genuinely get the feeling that work gets done here. Not just another fap/anime station
 




 source? looks exactly like the kind of cheesy low budget cyberpunk films i've come to love so much.
 




 Are you afraid of it?
 




 didn't teach it any new moves hope that's alright
 




 I can help ya out!

 




 [item] Yeah so I just want to move my stone from my copy of X over to Ruby. Will trade it along with the charizard. Appreciate any help!  




 Great setup man! love the baman/piderman sticker haha.. nice touch.  




 Yeah until they realize how much fun it is to play MTG blazed...
 




 Nice! I was impressed and then I saw the pano and now i'm really impressed. I too hope to someday have a big 3 desk setup just like this for mixing, production and gaming respectively. Also I didn't know people stream their studio sessions on Twitch, good to know..
 




 all that beautiful desk space!
 




 Just imagining the possibilities if I had a desk that big..
 




 LOL I kinda got used to the hat for a while, since he could actually pull it off, but then back by season 4 I was like dude... enough with the damn fedora. He's dealing with the worlds most elite rings of thieves and he's dressed like a fucking Le Chateau mannequin. 




 I find the writing is consistently great and I love Neal and Mozzie, but the way they wrap up EVERY SINGLE episode with Jones and Diana busting in at the last possible second and then the "caught the bad guys" happy ending slow jazz track rolls out. I still don't even hate the endings, just hard not notice the pattern after 5 seasons..
 




 haha fair enough! I think tipping within Canada is different but yeah I could see the ones who go down for the winter on a budget tipping poorly. 




 I'm an apparently gullible Canadian and i'm genuinely curious as to whether you're serious or not.

 More of a techno goth. I think it was movies with alternative club scenes like Blade and The Matrix when I was little that really got the interests flowing.   




 Here's some stuff i'm into. I can't afford these particular brands so I settle for minimal, toned down versions of the look, but this is the kind of aesthetic I really dig.

 I disagree and personally hope this completely ruins her career. She straight up roasted that woman, that's the kind of shit that makes depressed people go home and off themselves. If only more rampant bitches were forcibly humbled like this maybe the world wouldn't be such an intolerable place for all us "regular folk." 

Not even on my worst day ever would I resort to that kind of language and behaviour, and i'm just a nobody college student not some professional whose entire image is based on public perception. If she was really half as smart and savvy as she's convinced she is she'd have never acted that way to anyone, ever..
 




 It's okay, I didn't know you could lock on to enemies until after Anor Londo
 




 I just meant if you're planning on starting the game on the trip 9 hours won't be enough to get anywhere in-game :P 




 9 hours - hah!

 Yeah i'm sure it's a good time, I'm not hating or anything just found it a little bit funny in my head.
 




 Yeah but meeting up to play videogames makes sense because you actually have something to do. :)
 




 lol I mean I love my mechanical keyboard but a bunch of people meeting up just to talk about and take pictures of their multiple keyboards cracks me up for some reason.
 




 Macbook Pro
 




 Yeah those dragonslayer archers are admittedly hard to get past, even if you know what you're doing. Also that fucking titanite demon in the cathedral one hits me even at 46 vit and full Havel armour in NG+ lol 




 First play-through I was having trouble up until Anor Londo. Then once I got to the big ol sunny city everything just clicked and I was taking out those giants and gargoyles like nothing. Farmed the painted world for little while and got a bunch of levels, got lucky and killed S O second try, smooth sailing from there on.

Now in NG+ I'm back in Anor Londo and S O are making me their bitch. 




 UP anybody? 




 play this every time by default
 




 Izalith. Fuck that titanite demon shortcut.
 




 I agree with pretty much the same things everybody is saying here. Dark Souls 1 is a more special experience in almost every way, the only thing DS2 has on it is updated graphics. 

The design, atmosphere, lore, combat, and overall consistency of DS1 is far better. 




 The Second Renaissance. It's a part of the Animatrix compilation. Short but well worth watching. I believe it's in parts on youtube. 




 holy fuck H M got a bigass sign now
 




 Behold, the great white towers of Detroith 




 love it, kinda reminds me of old Skinny Puppy. 808's all over each track and still managed to keep it deep and dark
 









 Also read up about the legendary nightclub Berghain. It's literally a standing temple devoted to hedonism and cheap overindulgence to this day. It  began as a sex club that happened to play music and evolved from there. It is what immediately came to mind when you described the sort of place you envision.  




 Anyone who plays the mainroom at Berghain. I recommend you check out some of the Reclaim Your City podcasts on SoundCloud to see if they fit your aesthetic. It's generally dark and future-industrial but still dancey club techno. It's the stuff the real heads are listening to, straight out of places like Berlin, Tokyo, Rome, etc. Idk if that's your thing or not, but I love it and I totally feel like it fits in with the whole cyberpunk aesthetic.

 Merely having billions of dollars is not my definition of a success. It depends what is done with it. And most people in the bracket we're discussing haven't done a thing to earn their fortunes anyways, most are born into it. (with obvious exceptions.)

I like Gates because he actually puts his money where his mouth is and donates the vast majority of his personal fortune to causes that benefit society. But this earth doesn't need more families like the Rothschild's or the Waltons, whether they admit it or not.  




 So you don't see the problem then, clearly..
 




 Nobody cares about the doctors taking home 400k for decent honest work. That's the American dream. 

It's the corrupt politicians who give their powerful friends breaks and enable the ultra-rich to get richer that people have a problem with. Sadly while being a billionaire is great, self made or not... you've gotta face the ethical qualms of having a personal fortune worth more than some countries entire GDP and still actively trying to get more.
 




 So you're not convinced there's a wealth gap at all because there's not a reliable source in the video to confirm it?

lol have you not seen rich people? have you not seen poor people?
 




 To most people it's not the doctors and lawyers that are the problem, but some of the more prominent politicians, bankers and CEOs who really make up the gross wealth gap. 

400k a year is still relative pennies to the super-rich "1%" (more like 0.0001% probably) who take home millions, in some cases billions a year. I say fuck those guys too.. nobody needs that kind of money in a lifetime.

As soon as I got close enough they were a piece of ez 
 




 I'm a melee knight and i'm rocking a Black Knight sword+5, which so far has been holding up great for the duration of the game (already went through Anor Londo with it). But when I go back to vs the Four Kings I virtually seem to do no damage. Do I need to use a transient curse or something? Or just find a weapon with magic damage? What do you guys recommend? I have virtually no INT..
 




 A good chunk of the world still has trouble feeding themselves.. This idealistic article fails to take into account that this technology will only be available to a relatively small percentage of wealthy people with expendable time and income, generally first world countries. Sure it's gonna be awesome for those who can afford it, but it's likely not going to stop any ideological wars in chaotic countries that don't even have adequate basics such as food, shelter, etc.
 




 Her ovaries just exploded

*scroll down.. see that jokes already been made in like 30 different ways
 




 Honestly all DJs have different styles and methods of mixing their music. Some mix straightforward, back to back with two decks. Some scratch or use creative use of effects. A hip hop turntablist is still a DJ, but the methods involved in mixing hip-hop are vastly different than say a 3,4 even 5 or 6-deck purist techno set with loads of loops and tools. 

Unfortunately, typically the bigger a producer DJ gets, the more he has to adhere to a specific sound, the one all the fans who started following him want to hear. That plus the insane logistical nightmare bigger shows have of lining up sets with lighting, fireworks, pyrotech, etc is what generally leads to more predictable "press play" type sets.

 




 If I had a dollar for every person i've heard say "DJs only press play" but couldn't tell me the first thing about what the mixer does...

Obviously there are fake/"unethical" DJs, but people act as though there's this race of magical mix-elves who pre record everything for the DJs and then they just have to go up on stage and hit play.  




 Sometimes it's better to stay underground with a dedicated and loyal following.
 




 You guys just made me sad :(

 How do you hook up your two external displays to that macbook with only one display port? I want an extra vertical monitor for reading but idk how to hook up a second one.  
























 Gargoyle bike is tight
 




 I've been caught breaking the law (minor stuff like weed in public) three times now and every single time the cops let me off with a friendly warning. Always polite, never intimidating. I love Alberta cops.

 I recently read how as far back as Ancient Greece, philosophers have had theories about how reality as we know it could be an illusion, sort of like in The Matrix. How far back does this concept go and what caused humans to initially become skeptical of the world around us without any proof?
 




 Cable management needs work
  




 goddamn that's exactly what I thought it was gonna be lol
 




 Yooo I want one
 




 Indeed, for me cyberpunk is more of an aesthetic than it is about the actual advances in technology! Until we get into cyborg territory that is. That shit is quintessentially cyberpunk.  




 A short by Dylan J Nathan. 














 All great :)
 




 I fucking love my boosts! Enjoy mate

 na dude particle board is super weak it was like an IKEA desk. 




 ah that sounds little too exploit-y, I just want some extra time to heal goddamn
  




 was it no bonfire?
 




 never the actual controller, but I had a particle board desk at one time until I "accidentally" put a few holes in it with the butt end of an xbox controller.
 




 yeah I fail at parrying and I'm stuck on him right now in NG+++

What's this pillar trick? :P
 




 As a heavy tank build I think Four Kings is probably the easiest boss in the game for me. If you get right up on them their hits only takes out like 1/15th of my health every time 




 I'm stuck on Gwyn right now on NG+++ and for some reason I just can't fucking get parrying down so it comes down to luck and rolling away in time to spam estus after staggering him..
 




 I finally picked up Dark Souls a few months ago and fell in love with it after hearing my coworkers rave about it forever. I'm now on NG+++ and about 150~ hours in. Haven't even gotten to trying multiplayer yet (on Xbox and don't feel like paying for live)

By contrast I picked up Dark Souls 2 SoFS after finishing my first playthrough of 1, played about 10 hours into it and quit. None of the things I loved about Dark Souls made it over to the new iteration. Working at a game store, I have met people who really love DS2 just as much if not more than the original, but I find the overwhelming majority of people say Dark Souls was definitely a more impactful game.
 




 Age of Empires and the school library! I was a nerdy little child. 
 




 name it Zweihander
 




 lol k liam neeson settle down
 




 what a time to be alive
 




 GT was terrible anyway.
Yaay new cannon DBZ!
 




 But what does it mean?
 




 Hopefully she never ever hears about the club Berghain
 




 I thought it was gonna be a Matt Damon/ Capra Demon mashup. Awesome work though!
 




 Sibyl is located in 101
 




 Finally getting to Bigtits room and acquiring the Lordvessel is by far one of best feelings in the game.
 




 Yeah it's waay harder to kill Smough first! Every time after my first play-through  i've attempted to kill him first because I want Ornsteins set (NG+++ now) but every time I end up giving up and killing Ornstein first because I just want the damn lord vessel already. 




 Alright so I'm mostly a house and techno guy but come on who the fuck doesn't like hip hop?

Anyways i've been wanting to round out my rap collection as of late and my question to this sub is what are some of the must-knows of the digital rap world? What are the best places to keep up on both news and releases? 

I love to digitally crate dig and find new music; I know iTunes is usually the go-to place to actually buy the music but sometimes I prefer the more curated sites, ones usually run by the real heads in the scene. Any advice would be much appreciated.  




 omg I love this sub
 




 What he said ^
 




 Tough choice, both nice boards. I also kind of want a wasd with a little less loud switches haha. 




 ^ me on an alt
 




 lol ya
forgot to crop it out
 




 No I don't think so, Gold serpent ring would help though.
Sometimes I play a game where I take a hit every time I die... almost passed out trying to beat S O
 









 lol I still use BKS+5 as my daily driver 3 playthroughs in. I'm a str build tho so it scales well, out-damages all of the boss soul weapons save for Artorias great sword I think, which i'll never have enough int to use anyway :(

Ps love the username haha, Dank souls is the shit
 




 "Neither campus authorities nor police believed her. Combined with the fact that she is broadcasting her rape to the media, granting interviews to anyone who will ask (heres a video interview with Time), and using it to get an easy A grade on her thesis, its safe to conclude that we are looking at a false rape accusation by a mentally unstable woman. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this girl was not truly raped, and instead was sour about being pumped and dumped after giving up her anus to a guy she had the tingles for." 




 LPT: If you're going to comment on a story at least read it first.
 




 I hope that mattress causes her to lose her balance on a very tall staircase...
 




 lol yeah I killed them in my first play through but now I always just nope past em to the shortcut
 




 hell even the regular hollows are dangerous with their berserk move. And don't get me started on the skeleton hounds in NG++... fucking 1 shots even with tank build and fully upgraded giant armour  




 lol 




  I agree he's probably one of the easiest high level boss fights, next to pinwheel..

 Gameplay wise, Four Kings because you just have to go all in and it's a rush falling into the abyss for the first time not knowing wtf is going on. But Nito is definitely my fave. So badass plus finally getting to warp out of the Tomb of the Giants after finishing him is a great feeling.  




 media =/= real life
 




 TIL there are elitist South Park fans. Insecure people can be pretentious about anything I guess..
 




 I think you take yourself a bit too seriously m8
 




 Half the episodes are based on current events and pop culture. The quality is and forever has been hit or miss. Some episodes are brilliant others are just filler. I'm just saying as long as they keep poking fun at current events the show can never become irrelevant. 
 




 I feel pretty much the opposite way.. like it can never really get stale unless society stops doing dumb shit that can be made fun of. Which will be never.
 




 What if I told you it doesn't matter in the slightest. Like literally not at all.  




 nice, for a second I thought I was in /r/synthesizers
 




 I totally needed this at 4 am....not. haha

but seriously that's some fucked up food for thought. 
 




 As far as I could tell the robot was actually designed to intentionally purchase illicit items from the deep web as part of an art project/experiment. All the items, including ecstasy, a fake passport and a ballcap with a hidden pov camera were confiscated at the end of the project, in accordance with the plan.
 




 Check out some fashion designs by companies like Aitor Throup, Musee Noir, Rick Owens. They're expensive as fuck but should serve as good inspiration. 

These are a couple of my faves (some are jackets but they're still hooded)

Edit* Forgot Acronym... they're pretty dope too 




 yeah so that it can be used as a dual display with no overlap. Some of the newer monitors have it
 




 I never noticed it before but :9 looks like a weird smiley with it's tongue out. Also nice monitor! Is it one of those ones you can partition?
