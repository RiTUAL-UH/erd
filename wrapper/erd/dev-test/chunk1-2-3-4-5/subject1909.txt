 Wow. You are beautiful! I would suggest a job as a model. Haha, but I'm srs 




 TIFU: I didn't check to see if the plane heading towards the twin towers was on course. We all now know it wasn't Sorry guys. 














 Wow. You may have just given me a knee high sock fetish. haha xD 




 Thanks but I have no fucking idea what that means xDD I don't  know much about networks and such. Thanks for responding but could you explain some more? 




 Who took those pics? Did you use the timer thingy on a camera? 




 To be honest... its for porn. Anyway my parents use OpenDNS to filter and there is almost NO WAY to get past it. I have found a proxy that isn't blocked but it cant play videos. halp xDD (Tor is blocked)
Videos please. Don't give me a subreddit like /r/gonewild or a site with gifs or pics 




 Can I has old PC? xDD 




 Cat Mating... damn, nothing came up... 














 I stole a lot of daedric stuff and thought "It would be cheaper to just get teleported to dragons reach" i paid the money then cried as a lost all my items 




 Well maybe a base build. With a motherboard that could be upgraded to be great? But everything else low end? That is what I am looking for. 




 I would like a good cheap gaming pc. 200 dollars or under if possible. I don't have a lot of money to buy a good pc and am never lucky enough to find anything good at thrift shops. I also would like a pc that could be easily upgraded when i get more money so it would slowly become better and better. Right now i have a 2009 pc with a integrated graphics card, a core 2 duo and 6 gigs of ram. The mother board is to old to support new stuff. Thanks!! 




 A mod that replaces all signs with easy to read rainbow comic sans with a addition sign with doge on it. This would be great. xD but I am serious. 




 Interesting. But... Why creates that black hole?!?! (Dramatic Chimpmunk) xD thanks for the input and that is a interesting idea 




 But what did it expand from? Or do we not know? Sorry this is probably a stupid question but I couldn't understand all te stuff I found on google haha 




 I use my PS3 as a dvd/blue ray player xD. Don't know if it has that. 




 but how would i get the dvd player to let me choose which film i would like to play? 




 I'm am stuck at 66/68. How to fix? 




 It is useful in some ways but it would be better if you could play at the same time. 




 When I heard of family sharing I thought, Great! I can play a game with my family without buying it more than once! But no. Say you want to play Monaco with your brother. You can't play at the same time! It is silly. You can share games but not play at the same time! I think it is really silly and pointless. '_'  




 I NEED a link or a site used to make this. It looks amazing. 




 I relate so much 




 ^^^ 




 *facepalm* thank you. I do not know geography. D; Thank you 3 




 I know im derping so much right now xDD 




 Where is this!?!?! I need to go...
 









 I'm a idiot. my PC i meant keyboard. I was joking about how shitty my rig is. xD. Since people were uploading pics of their mouses i uploaded a pic of mine. Then someone wanted a pic of my keyboard. So i did. xD is it possible to edit titles? :3 




 That is actually really cool looking and mine is REALLY old. 




 Just uploaded
 









 I also have a shit DELL keyboard if you would like to see that. 3 









 Thanks!!! If I had money i would give you gold. 3 




 Ummmm. I don't konw what it means. xD i thought it had to do with Nazis. but idk 




 At the con i went to it was supposed to be 40 for the pic and 40 for the autograph but they dun goofed and made it 40 for both so i got quite a deal. 




 Hey Karen!
You are an amazing actress and wondered if you were asked to do a voicing role for a video game or a cartoon/English anime dub if you would do it. I don't know if it would be your decision or not because I know hardly anything about the acting industry. Also, who was your favorite actor/actress to work with? (P.S. I love your hair 3 3 3) 




 I smell a repost
 




 haha, sorry about that. At least he spelled HIS name right. =P 




 I never said I didn't get it at a convention. I did. I wanted to share with other Whovians that I got his autograph and was happy about it. Sorry to disappoint you.  




 What do you mean? 









 We need more people that knew potts. 




 I know, i know im an idiot... i dont get it xD 




 Where did you go Potts? We miss you. Come back D= Why did you unfriend us? 




 Shi No Barado -Area 11
The best way to do it has to be to show her a beautiful song by a band almost no one has heard of, but is amazing. :3 




 Yeah but there are no library in my area that have it due to the movie recently coming out. 




 I'm too poor for that... don't judge... 









 Yeah, thanks for the comment this helped me a lot  




 Okay thanks for the response. But I'm attracted to her. Bet she is a guy and I'm attracted to her but she's a guy. Since I'm a guy and she is a guy am I bi? 




 I was attracted to him when he was a she. Now she is a he and I am still attracted to him =P 




 But he's a guy. 




 Yes. 




 He used to be a girl. And she thinks shes a trans guy. Would I be considered bi? He's attracted to guys still but now does that make me attracted to guys? 




 Well, it still has a HUGE 80's vibe xD 




 haha, thanks. yeah im kinda derp when it comes to well, everything. xD Anyway I found a really stupid fun mod http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52622/? 




 Yes i have tried that mod out just for the laughs and it surprisingly hardly increases performance! xD 




 I want you guys the silliest mods out there! They don't have to be lore friendly. Just stupid. =P 




 Thank you guys SOOOOOO much! I would give you all gold if i had the money. =P Yeah the issue is solved! 




 Sorry for the weird way of showing you, but here are my specs. I have a crappy late 2009 desktop running windows 7 (64 bit) http://imgur.com/1zJ80sg 




 Well, I have used a couple mods to increase performance, like colorful lights and something else which I can't remember. I was just looking for more =P but thanks for the feedback! No one ever really responds to my posts xD 




 I agree. Mexican Lassie was awesome! 




 Yeah the title says most of it. I have installed some and get around 20-35 fps on a good day. Its playable but I would like some mods to help it run better. Thanks! 




 I guess, I live in the south and there aren't that many openly gay people. Also, I'm not gay even though i highly support gay rights, so I wouldn't know. =P

 What's with all the MIRs? I know what they are, that's not what I'm asking. Why does everything have a MIR right now? It isn't a holiday or anything.  




 Valve may have had custom parts that slightly differ from all the stock counter-parts. But I do agree. If a non-glorious non-peasant who wants to join PC just googles these things, sees the most expensive model available, then when they get the device it preforms like shit.   




 The fucking end all is 10x cheaper that those pieces of shit. an i3 for $1000+ dollars! WHAT!!

 Watch cory of course. The anime takes a completely different path from the mango. Don't worry 




 Yes! When I was a kid this game was the shit! By that I mean it was shit. I knew it was then. I was a HUGE Sonic fan. I loved the 2D games this was my first 3D "Sonic" game and I realized the 2D ones were so much more fun. Shadow was so mean I didn't like him. I wanted my nice happy hedgehog back :( 




 Yep

 My SM is around 180000 




 Thanks! 




 Right now I have a halberd and that knight guy's lightning sword. I also have found the secret you mentioned but thanks! 




 I've done the bird thing. I can't beat it.
I've gone to Heide's Tower. Can't beat it 




 I know where it is and I have visited it multiple times but I cannot get through it. I was hoping someone could join my game and help me. 




 Don't even list it. On valves website at the very bottom in tiny text there is a number that happens to be the app number so if you insert it it takes you the HL3 page... 




 The Pursuer and The Last Giant. 




 I need a little help. I'm not to good although I have beat the first two bosses but now I can't progress. I don't know what to do. Can anyone help? 




 I am not too good and DS. I need help with Heides Castle. If you would like to help PM me. Thanks! :) 




 I'm US/Canada Central Standard 




 I will and I do have a mic. My PS3 is in another room so I won't be checking this anymore ok? 




 In forest of fallen giants where that weird trader with all the crap on her back is.
How will we meet up though? Will you place one of the call sign things? 




 Yeah 




 Yeah... 




 I don't think I've beat any. xD 




 I don't really know how to judge how far I am. 




 MoonChap and 14690 (I started a few days ago) 




 It doesn't seem like to many people play PS3. Anyone want to play? 




 I do have a mic and would love to chat sometime. I'll try to add you. PS3's friend system is the worst 0.o 




 I have about 5000
I'll PM you username 




 I sent it 




 My PC can't run anything. I am playing on PS3.
I do have steam if we could chat over that so I could learn how to play the game that would be great. 




 Same god? What do you mean? 




 Soul Memory Range?
(sorry I know nothing, thanks for helping) 




 So if I wanted to play with someone, I would just have to wait around? 




 Any way I can invite someone or get someone to come help me? 




 How do I find a summon sign? 




 Second Boss?! Who the hell is the first boss?! 




 I know and I have been there and got pretty damn far until I'm in a city like place with shittons of blood stains and messages saying stuff like "Bravery Required Ahear" and "Don't fight alone" I wen't up a ladder and there is some crazy ass armored dude flying across the screen so I ran away so I didn't die. 




 I am new to DS as a series and started with Dark Souls 2. How do I get to play with someone? There are some enemies I can't beat without help. 




 Okay, so I'm definitely going Polaroid 




 Need help making a decision on a VERY interesting run. I started as Azazel now i have gilitine, holy water, holy mantle, revenge fly, that floating spider spawner thingey, and all together six maximum heart containers. I just killed mom. Do I go Negative or Polaroid?

 I REALLY need parts. Unfortunately they cost lots of money which I don't have. I have only upgraded my PC once. At the moment I have a Core 2 Duo, 1TB HDD (The only good bit) 4GB of memory, whatever the heck intel mobo that the pc came with, and Intel G41 Express Chipset. It can't run anything at more than 30 FPS. I never have had a good PC but I don't use consoles solely because I lack the money to buy the console or games, and they're awful. I have started a fund so any money I don't need goes in. Currently it is $25. I would cry tears of joy if I could win this card to help me ascend a little higher up. Thank You for reading OP. If you want to steam message me just PM me and I will tell you details. 




 This would have been a good post if you didn't use the term "gamer-girl" This makes it sound like you think you will get likes because you are a girl. If you just titled it "First PC Build to Ascend from Consoles" it would be a lot less annoying. Also, we can see your fingernails. We can tell you are a girl. 




 Okay, I don't really know what I was expecting. Thanks for the response. 









 So, I'm making a build. I have no money. There is no way on earth I can afford to buy it all at once. My PC ATM is really awful.
(Intel Core 2 Duo E7400 @ 2.80GHz, Intel G41 Express Chipset, 4.00GB Dual-Channel DDR2, Intel Corporation DG41RQ) and I am going to make an upgrade... eventually. I am going to buy the parts one by one and slowly replace my pc. (Like that boat paradox, if you know what I'm talking about) I want to buy parts that can replace my parts now until I have replaced every part. Can you guys help me pick really cheap parts that are usable and that could fit in my pc now? 

Sincerely, someone whos pc is still better than a console but still is shit, Michael... 




 pm me? 









 Think about what you are doing. There are starving peasants in Africa that can't get a pc because amazon and new egg don't ship to Africa and you are talking like what you have is bad. Shame on you. (btw when you upgrade can you give me parts?) 




 I'm pretty sure that's my best buy o.0 




 Throw away that shit mod brother. I too have an awful computer. This is the mod that lets me play this great game. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15123/? 




 For those who don't know the three dollar bill gives you the rainbow tears. Do you guys love it or hate it. With this item there isn't really an in between. I believe the item is great if you git it at the beginning of a run. From Middle/End, it is unpredictable and will probably get you killed eventually. 




 It takes me at most 2 hours. If Portal took you 5 hours Portal 2 will take you 10. 









 My favorite doctor is the newest, Peter Capaldi. He just came on the scene and I am already in love with him. His character is more dark and powerful than the other doctors, so you never know what he is going to do. Claras character perfectly compliments his, always keeping him in check and often taking matters into her own hands. The writing this season has been a little chiche but is still great. Capaldi is making Doctor Who better no matter what the 9 year old girls say who hate him because he is old.

I've been wanting Shovel Knight for a while, but whenever I had the money, it wasn't on sale so I bought something else that was cheaper so I could get more bang for my buck. Now it is on sale and I don't have the money .


 




 books. People are making unofficial minecraft books. Go to walmart and you can find a ton of them. It is pretty awful how many there are.  









 Wanna all join the fun maps server? 




 In a few years. Everyone will play on the NerdCubed fan servers. There will be a documentary about our accomplishments. And the stars of it? Captain_Cone, Hendlton, train_subject1909, Divexz, and account-temp. (Probably not account-temp. His name isn't classy enough) 




 Yes! PM each other our steam names? 




 TF2 is still really popular, yet I haven't seen one person on the servers in a long time. 




 I believe I am practicing patience. Three years of patience and peasantry.  




 I even picked out the whole build. It was steal crap but we don't have money.  How many years until I can join the glorious master race. 




 The college kids get a free scholarship and books and tons of other stuff.  It's unfair that someone gets a scholarship for throwing a ball when they don't care about education at all. While intelligent children are going to low quality community colleges. 









 I haven't had the money to spend on games but now I do. Should I wait until it goes on a bigger sale or get in now? 





























 original guide? 




 Holy Fuck! I have a friend with that last name. Oh myy. 




  oh i was assuming it was $60

It says on the box. It is easy to see. It is on the top of the box. http://www.bestbuy.ca/multimedia/Products/500x500/103/10341/10341740.jpg 




 At walmart it is $40 new with code. How much did it cost a Gamestop? 




 That is exactly what I was wondering... 




 Nerd3 crashed the site! I didn't know of the game before him. I would like the fans to know we are sorry! xD 




 Outer Wilds even! 




 No DLC if pre-owned. Even if the person didn't use them. I only saw New Day One at walmart. TBH You should probably take it in a get your money back, then save a little to get the preorder bonus if you want it.  




 Pick me! 




 I didn't preorder, I didn't have the money at the time, I really wanted the exclusives. I got them, legit, here is how. If you don't have the game yet, great, if you do, you need some extra money. Anyway here's the point. At Walmart, because they don't know how games work, you can still get the Day 1 edition! The code works too! It is valid until 2099, so you'll be fine.

EDIT: Sorry! Only console!! :(
 




 You know why he did this? To show her that he had been wanting to marry her for a fucking year. Every day, no matter what he loves her and cares for her. If you view this as messed up you need a marriage counselor...

 Damn, I wonder what the incest in that will be like. 




 /r/softwaregore 




 Well, there was obviously an error in the card randomization am I correct? 




 Well, by Wallgreen's I mean non-gaming shops. 









 Probably. 




 It confuses my simple mind. 




 When you get a pack at a non-gaming store, like Walmart or Target it comes in a cardboard container. The container has these tear able flaps. What are they for? Does anyone know? 




 Oh, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for telling me. This will help me a lot. xD 




 We've all seen these messages, but can someone explain to me what they mean 




 Yep, because there sure were lots of black people in medieval times. Don't even get me started on how many important roles females had! That post is like saying 12 Years a Slave is racist because there was slavery. 




 The swipe and the hand laser always gets me. I roll into that small pit that is impossible to see. 




 My tip is just avoid it. The game gets even harder when you beat gravity. 




 [Spoiler:](/s "Mine is definitely Old Iron King. He IS an easy boss, but the terrain is so odd you roll in to lava every time to try to fight him. All the semi-invisible lava pits make it a lot harder than it should be.") 




 How many souls in total you have. You can only meet people within a certain range of your SM so you don't get invaded by lvl 100's when your'e lvl 33 




 My SM is 373337 and I need help pm me on reddit or add me as MoonChap on psn

 Yes please,  I finally finished the wharf and an now on lost bastille  




 My soul thing is 214407 




 I posted my soul memory above in the original post and I don't really know what to do next. :P I have beat the first 4 bosses but now I'm stuck. 




 I need help on DS2. Right now my total soul count is 135000. MSG me if you can help. 




 Really dick of me, I know, very sorry 




 Sorry, but I got involved in a stream (http://www.twitch.tv/last_grey_wolf). It's almost over will check then.

 I believe B has a 75% chance of being right. He knew that to begin with he had a 50% chance of being right, or 2/4. Then he knew A was red and that he only had a 1/4 chance of being red, and a 3/4 chance of being blue. Prisoner C also had a 75% chance of being red since when B left, who was blue, he knows there is only one more blue. so the 50% became 75%. Correct me if I'm wrong 




 So sad, please don't. 









 I have spent a lot more time on Isaac. My steam may be fucked up. idk 




 Wasn't able to get on internet for a long while so was playing in offline mode. Once I played the game in online it updated all my achivements.

 Okay, will take. Thanks. :) 




 As Azazel, (non-seeded) I got mom's knife first item room and took it. Now the deal with the devil is scythe tears. Will it override mom's knife or make the knives spin? Anyone know?

 Nope. The principal keeps phones forever if they are out. Don't risk it. 




 Damn dude! You gf got ripped off. I think the "aquarium" is a toy fish and a blanket! 




 I can't take a picture because no phones in school. So I drew it in MS PAINT. Every classroom has one blue wall now. Why? 




 Cell. He was definitely the most interesting. All his forms just made him creepy and more in-human than some of the other villains. 




 It was a Cloverfield done right in my opinion. It has the scares, suspense, everything you need. It is inspired slightly bi Slenderman but really added most of the iconic Slender things like the noise when he's around, the static, many other things I won't spoil. Its great but expect the spoops. :D 




 What do you mean?

 I still can't understand the 3rd sentence. 









 Interesting. Was it a good deck? On a scale of 1-69 how good? Also, did you lose or did he give you a challenge? I may do something like that. Seems cool. 









 With Knowledge and Power and similar cards, and cards that require you to scry. Could you have a dick where there was a heavy focus on scrying. I have started to modify my main deck, which is a crappy fire deck, to include more scrying to take advantage of this card. Any other red mana if you scry do "___" or scry cards?

 You won't get karma because it is a text post. :p 




 Oh, 1 year and still learning. I didn't know self posts didn't get karma. I guess that is why sometimes people post images of text?

 OP is a faggot... 




 Scumbag OP. Complains about hashtags, uses hashtags. 




 At least you got karma 
























 Call of Wide: Wide at Wide. Did I do it right? 




 It can look good if you don't throw $30 worth of LEDS in a case and hope it looks good. 




 . omfg so good 









 I was expecting for them to put that one make up in their eye to make them entirely black. With someone doing a dick copter in the back to make it NSFW. 




 Holy fuck. That took a dark turn 




 This may seem like advertisement, but I assure you it isn't. It is raising awareness to a charity. If there are other places I could post this where it would be more relevant I would gladly do so, or you could. There is a charity going to get children in Detroit Hospital a "GO kart" which is a kiosk with a tv and everything hooked up so a child who can't leave their room, can still enjoy games. Currently Twitch streamer DanGheesling is doing this charity event to provide these. He has 4 hours left and is half way there. We, the PC gamers, could easily help him, even if we each gave 50 cents. (USD) This is a great charity I think we could support. Now there is one problem, they are xbones, but do you think a kid, who hasn't his bed in a month would give a fuck? If you are donating or even watching, cut the master race shit and support a good cause.

 I'm just pointing out, a black guy gets attacked, its on CNN. A white guy? Local news. Police brutality affects EVERYONE, not just black people. 




 TIL Exercise makes you unhealthy 




 Man, its a shame that ANOTHER black man has been hurt because of police brutality. Oh wait, it was a white cop AND a white civilian. It almost seems like this has to do with police being assholes and it not just being racial tension... huh 









 Hodor 




 Not a teacher but I found my principals twitter. She has zero tweets. But her profile picture is her riding a horse wearing a top hat. She is a 5 foot tall woman.  









 never heard of that. Link? 




 Is there a shark in your pocket or are you happy to see me? 




 Dammit. You beat me to the karma. D: 




 Takin' the downvotes like a champ! Kappa 




 Do I get mods with it? 




 I is nots sure if these is legit.  




 idk 




 Yeah, the soul isn't there. I have no idea how she even died. :/ Also, can I make weapon flamey or lightning? Like the Uchikatana, which I had been using up until the lightning spear. 




 All the weapons I have are taking forever. Any suggestions for weapons I should get? 




 What would be a good sword to use? 




 This is my first time with Dank Souls. I had a standard run I guess. Except my Quelaag fight. I don't know what happened. I fought her over and over again. Kept dying. After 69 times I go and she isn't there. I never got her soul. I cannot make Quelaags Fury Sword. From every lets play I see they ALWAYS use that sword. Is there any alternative to that sword that I could use in Anor Londo or if any of you have a Quelaag sword or souls that doesn't fit your build could I have it? Keep in mind I am a noob. Thanks! :D 




 666 is the sign of the anti-christ. In the bible people are marked with that to show that they are with the devil or some shit. I would expect the Mark would be the mark in the bible. Which it is. :p

 I'm joking. The game will look like BF4. Good on PC. Makes you cry on consoles. :p 




 Star Wars: Battlefront. The new one. That is coming out.. 




 Hello Chris! Let me say, I am a HUGE fan and love you as an actor. The question is, how long did it take you to lose weight and get buff for the role of Star-Lord. Also, would you consider making a workout CD. I would buy that. 




 This is probably what the graphics will look like in battlefront. :/ 




 WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!!! THIS IS NOT TAKING TO SERIOUSLY! THIS RUINS THE ENTIRE KARMA ECONOMY!!!!11one Kappa 



















 It isn't a cross post. It wasn't the same poster. Two different posters is a repost. 




 Yeah, I guess. I would rather see unfunny shit than stolen shit. I mean, would you rather find a dollar on the road or would you want someone to take a dollar from you.

 Oh, yeah. Sorry I got confused. :p 









 Hey Chef! I will cut the crap and just ask you a question. Has someone ever been too good to get on the show? and have you ever had to cut the show because something happened like the building burned down, they were good, they were too shit, etc.?
