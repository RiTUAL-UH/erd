 Is your friend on Reddit? You mentioned it was inspired by depression, which is the main reason I like it; I have clinical depression, too. I'd like to know the story behind it if he's comfortable sharing.  









 Might become a tattoo of mine.  




 Want. Where can I find it? 




 "Look! One's an innie and one's an outie!" -family guy 









 you're* 









 I want one! 




 She's not in the kitchen. 




 The pic reminds me of AC3. 




 Why is this a thing?! 









 I'll allow it. 
























 Mine is an 08. 














 Your friend, sir, is a bad ass. 









 Congrats man stay strong! 




 I'm so sorry for your loss.  









 I'm 27. Legend of the hidden temple was a popular gameshow for kids in the early/mid 90s. 




 As someone who comes from an entirely Jewish family, I just want to say thank you. 














 Captain Power and one of his nemeses (whose name I cant remeber...lord dread, maybe?) 




 Yeah I'm on medication. It took years to figure out what worked. But life is pretty good now. I hope your friend gets the help he needs. Tell him I'm rooting for him. I'll definitely let you know if I get his drawing as a tattoo. Does he have any other drawings? 









 You are truly a saint. 
























 I feel your pain. 




 I'm glad someone else has seen this commercial. I thought I was going crazy. This is by far the creepiest commercial I've ever seen thigh. 




 Haha I noticed the toy in the background after I posted the pic. It's part of a toy phone. 














 I'm sure I could find a few. They have all kinds of outdated tech hiding around the house. 









 I want one of those! 









 You should post this in r/earthporn 




 Well excuse me. I only use Reddit on my phone, and am still fairly new to it, so I'm not boned up on the etiquette. 














 @angrybane: yep, in a parking garage 









 ZING! 
























 Story of my life. 




 Well played, sir. 




 I actually did that a few years ago. Clearly doesn't for the context of the movie. Any idea where it's from? 




 Godspeed. 



















 Dude (or dudette)..you are freaking talented, my friend. 




 This needs more upvotes. 














 That, or it's the continental drop off. I saw something similar while deep sea fishing of the Florida keys. 




 Took me a second. Realized it's the 3 Stooges. 




 Yes. Yes you do. 




 He then stood up and walked into the kitchen. 





























 ...well played. 



















 Great, thanks. I'll post this in the Atlanta and dragoncon subreddits this evening. 




 I'm sure there is, but I haven't looked.  









 I work with your brother at Jimmy John's. Small world. 




 Right on. Will do. 




 Sweet! I'll start a thread on r/Atlanta this weekend once I figure out a good time and place. 




 I'm thinking about organizing a Reddit meet-up at D*Con this year. Would you be interested? 




 I was considering organizing a Reddit meet-up for Dragon*Con. Would you be down? 




 All I used was a pair of scissors and my hands for the tearing. The rest was a lighter and ash. 














 Bahahaha
