 What i don't get is why I a "loyal" customer have to pay full price for the service, but people who are flaky customers, on again off again, repeatedly get the discounts for introductory offers...why do i stay in business with them?  Bring on Google Fiber, I'm ready for a change. 









 I wasn't sure what this was until I did some googling and reading...http://yacy.net/en/index.html 




 Cool, I was wondering how you guys would do with this new update. 




 I'm working my way up to running, I just quit 74 days ago and I've gained some weight, been walking daily, but plan to step it up to running soon. 




 That's hilarious 




 That would be awesome. 
























 This is actually quite common, see number 7 on this list:

 yeah i like all of Ken Burns stuff, I LOVED the baseball one. 









 I'm the complete opposite, I drink more soda after quitting. 







































 I just hit 200 days smoke and nicotine free.  According to my quit smoking app on android (QuitNow!) i have avoided 8003 cigarettes saved $2000.75 and added 33 days and 8 hours to my life.  I don't even miss it anymore. It was a long and struggling couple of years to get here also.  I made a new years resolution to quit on Jan 1st, 2012 which lasted 3 days, started and stopped over and over for a couple months in early 2012, abandoned the quest for a while, made a few other daring quit attempts in 2012.  In 2013 I hit a 3 month span (my longest ever at the time) where I quit but I got complacent and fidured I could have "just one".  There is no such thing, a few more small attempts then August 8th, 2013 was my last cigarette, now at 200 days smoke and nicotine free, just over 6 months,a nd I'm NEVER going back.  :)

EDIT: after my last relapse, summer 2013, I was really depressed over failing yet again, my dad told me, "The man who never gives up, never fails." which fueled me to push on in this quit and make it succeed.  I am 34  years old, and have been smoking for 17 years, and towards the end I was up to 2 packs (40 cigarettes) a day.  Freedom! 




 Praise the Sun! 




 thanks :) 




 It was tough at first, REALLY tough, and I had several false starts, but after about 30 days I stopped obsessing about it and started to feel normal again.  Now I'm 4 months and change and it's easy and trigger come once in a blue moon but they are so quiet and so quick that it is of no consequence. 




 there aren't any T-shirts on the official arch schwag site, but I've bought some lanyards and other stuff from them here:

Also as mentioned by Jethro_Tell zazzle has a lot of t-shirts and other Arch merch:

 it has NO features other than a back and forward button, but here is a script I use (I didn't write this) for a python browser using pyqt4 and qtwebkit https://github.com/train_subject3168/Random-Scripts/blob/master/pybrowser.py save and run with python3 




 I think the average smoker starts at age 13...I would advise quitting earlier instead of thinking "I can always quit later" cause that's what most of us thought, before we knew it decades had passed. 
























 Which was my point, a website cannot go down, or people go somewhere else.  Hopefully it can be reliable now, so I can start posting there and learn some python :) 




 It's the most interesting story related to a history of a forum.  Most are just like, "Dude, I just created a forum for such and such, go post there."  Lol. 




 cool, you got the flair working!!! 




 also metulburr, i might add, that currently only fill_array() and display_array() functions work, the swap() function is only used in the sort_array() function which i have commented out at the bottom so the function is never called.  I still have to figure that part out. 




 How weird is that, I didn't read Mekire's thread before posting mine, but it mentions about sorting methods which coincidentally are the same things I'm reading about in my textbook right now.  Taking a peek at: https://github.com/Mekire/pysort/blob/master/pysort.py 




 Ok so you guys probably know my little brother, metulburr, I am train_subject3168. I am pretty new to python and just learning. I'm a computer science major in college at the moment.  Anyway, in a programming structure and logic class I'm in (intro level) in our textbook, the chapter I just read described the bubble sorting algorithm for sorting data, it has flowcharts and pseudocode and I thought I'd try to translate it to python (I'm using python 3.3.4 right now) I have functions for filling an array and sorting the array and then displaying the array, the filling and displaying work now, I still gotta fix the sorting one, but the real question is, my brother was noting that it shoudn't work at all because I have global variables and I use them in my functions, well look at the code:
    
    array_size = 5
    scores_array = []
    comparisons = array_size - 1
    x = 0
    y = 0
    temp = 0
    
    def fill_array():
        x = 0
        while (x  array_size):
            userinput = input("Enter a score:\n")
            userinput = int(userinput)
            #for i in range(5):
            scores_array.append(userinput)
            x = x + 1
    
    
    def sort_array():
        y = 0
        while (y  comparisons):
            x = 0
            while (x  comparisons):
                while (scores_array[x]  scores_array[x + 1]):
                    swap()
                x = x + 1
            y = y + 1
    
    def swap():
        temp = scores_array[x + 1]
        scores_array[x + 1] = scores_array[x]
        scores_array[x] = temp
    
    def display_array():
        x = 0
        while (x  array_size):
            print(scores_array[x])
            x = x + 1
    
    fill_array()
    
    print("\n")
    
    #sort_array()
    
    display_array()

now what is interesting is my brother pointed out to me that the code above runs with no errors, yet the code below throws an error "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'var' referenced before assignment"
in this code:
    
    var = 0
    
    def addone():
        var += 1
    
    print(var)
    addone()
    print(var)

Why is this? Does anyone know why the latter code throws the error but the first doesn't?
 




 I don't know the guy currently running the python forums website, as I'm pretty new around the forums, but it seems to be down an unacceptable amount of time, rendering the whole forum useless. 
























 yup, here it is, my ~/.i3/config:
http://pastebin.com/BSqZFpUY 




 no, that didn't work...same behavior. 




 Okay, so I've been using i3 for a while and love it, but I have one issue I still have yet to resolve that bothers me.  I use 9 workspaces and they are usually all filled with something, be it terminals or a web browser or whatever.  

If I am on one workspace, say workspace #3, and I want to move a window from it to workspace #5 (there are already things on workspace #5) then mod + Shift + 5 on the selected window creates a NEW #5 workspace instead of putting it on the existing 5th workspace, so now I have 2 "#5" workspaces.  Ideally I would like it to move the window to the existing workspace #5.  Any ideas as to how to accomplish this?  Thanks.

 I'm having the exact same issue.  I keep getting Error 118.  Total store, community, groups, etc lockout.
 




 Keep strong...it will pass.
