 Senior animal trainer Mike Alexander and a team of four experts spent a total of 19 weeks preparing the critters for their film debut. Once the animals became accustomed to sitting with the trainers (each squirrel was trained one-on-one), they were taught to pick up a nut and place it in a metal bowl. The bowl was eventually replaced by a conveyor belt for the film.

 I don't think so. I don't remember any scene like that from the movie. 




 Are those greenscreens outside the windows ?? 




 And Hardline. 














 Yeah, it will be a huge difference in audio(compared to 2CH in torrents) as you have a surround system as the blu-rays have uncompressed sound. You may notice a mild difference in video. The color would  appear more vibrant and grainyness and blockiness would be bare minimum. 




 Brazil  




 Each camera captures footage of the fight scene from different angles. This is helps in completing the fight in a single take.  




 As someone who was just like you, I have recently started collecting blu-rays. I think it is really worth if you respect the art form of movies. Here is my piece of advice :

* Learn about the region coding of blu-ray discs and players. Buying a region-free blu-ray player is a great advantage if you want to import from other countries.

* Work you way through bargains and box-sets first. This really helps to start a collection.

* You might wanna wait and see if 4k blu-rays, which will be released by the end of the year are reasonably priced or not. If they are, then you could buy a 4k blu-ray player (If you have a 4k TV or if you are planning to buy so in the near future).

 This is exactly what I thought about Guardians of the Galaxy. The story drags itself around back and forth and doesn't end anywhere but to a sequel. By the way, World War Z wasn't critically acclaimed in the first place. It has 68% on rt and 7/10 on imdb. It was just an 'ok' movie.

 I would add 'King of Comedy' to that list. 









 The uploader put great effort into editing the audio. But, as Stanley Kubrick's interviews are very rare, it was worth for sure. 
This meant that you'd hear Kubrick talk for about 3 or 4 seconds and then have a translator jump in and repeat what he said in French at a louder volume. Usually the translator would step in and cut off the first or last words that Kubrick was saying, or sometimes just talk over the top of him, making it even more difficult to listen to. Maddeningly, the translator would sometimes interject after he said only three or four words! Ciment's English-language questions were spoken over in French simultaneously, often rendering them impossible to hear.

 [For anyone interested about the story in the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EShApFSrXqw)  




 **Fun Fact** : Walt Disneys last written words were apparently Kurt Russell

As Walt Disney laid on his deathbed, suffering from lung cancer, in 1966, the story goes (later confirmed by Kurt Russell) that he scribbled on a piece of paper the name Kurt Russell. He died never writing another word.  Many have speculated what this could have meant, including the famous actor himself, Kurt Russell who in a 2007 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live said, Its true. I dont know what to make of that. I was taken into his office one time after he died and I was shown that. Russell was a child actor at the time for Disney, having just signed a ten year contract with the studio.

 [A message to young people from tarkovsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vvdtaaprzw)


"What would you like to tell people?"


"I dont know I think Id like to say only that they should learn to be alone and try to spend as much time as possible by themselves. I think one of the faults of young people today is that they try to come together around events that are noisy, almost aggressive at times. This desire to be together in order to not feel alone is an unfortunate symptom, in my opinion. Every person needs to learn from childhood how to be spend time with oneself. That doesnt mean he should be lonely, but that he shouldnt grow bored with himself because people who grow bored in their own company seem to me in danger, from a self-esteem point of view."

 He really wanted to do TWD properly. But, he got fired after season 1. He is now currently working on the screenplay for The Huntsman (2016).

Ill have you know that I have the /r/movies's favorite poster flair, and I lurk frequently in /r/truefilm, and I've watched all 250 films on the IMDB top 250 list. I am also the biggest fan of Christopher Nolan. You are nothing to me but just another pleb. I will downvote you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, pleb. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of reddit mods and you will be downvoted and banned swiftly, PLEB. Youre fucking dead, pleb. Not only am I extensively trained in reddit downvoting, but I am also great friends with /u/girafa , you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn pleb. I will downvote fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, PLEB. [OC] 




 Wow. This is gold. 




 **Interstellar**. 

Nolan made it in 1999. But, thought that it was too advanced for the public and believed that it would be snubbed. So, our savior has time-travelled from 1999 to 2014 to show us this gem of a movie. 

Hope It won't be snubbed in the 2015 oscars. Seig Heil.


P.S I'm in 2012 . Browsing Dank Memes. Brb.

 ***Say hello to my little friend*** :

[Scarface](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

*Director : Brian De Palma*

*Writer : Oliver Stone*

*Stars: Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer*

Although 1983 doesn't have as many good movies released as 1994 or 1999. It does have *Scarface*. *Scarface* received a bit of scorn on release from the critics including being nominated for a razzie award. This was mainly due to the fact that it was a remake. But, it was the kind of movie that grew on you after watching it. The epic ending alone makes anyone watch the whole movie again. *[Sigh, here I am watching the ending again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_z4IuxAqpE)* 

Let's talk about the story now. It is about a Cuban Immigrant (Al Pacino) trying to live the American Dream. That's it. This story paired with *Al Pacino going ham* and Giorgio Moroder's  synth fueled soundtrack adds to the awesomeness of this classic.




 




 Did you like his performance in Robocop ?

Although a short role, where did he do good in move ?

Where did he fall short ? 




 This may be the most apt explanation of the caption. [This scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTxh6DHhyzM) shows how immersed Riggan was in the play world and how he didn't even care what people thought about him in the real world. 




 You should post this to /r/Filmmakers too. They would like it.

 Where is the master of under-rated movies Nicholas Roeg ??

 This has been an ongoing debate for the past few days since Chappie has released and my answer is - I don't think so. Although Chappie has received quite a fair amount of backlash, Blomkamp has yet to make a movie on the *Shyamalan* level i.e. on the level of The Village or After Earth. 

I hope Blomkamp goes all out on the alien movie and does his best. He has shown his brilliance in District 9 which is proof he can make groundbreaking films. If the next Alien movie doesn't meet the expectations. Then ... well ... he may become like the present day ridley scott maybe ?? 









 Terry, who did her own stunts, almost lost her life during the filming of The Wizard of Oz when one of the Winkie guards accidentally stepped on her, breaking her foot. She spent two weeks recuperating at Judy Garland's residence, and Garland developed a close attachment.


Terry's salary, $125 per week, was more than that of many human actors in the film, and also more than many working Americans at the time.


Terry died at age 11 in Hollywood on September 1, 1945, and was buried at Spitz's ranch in Studio City, Los Angeles. The grave was destroyed during the construction of the Ventura Freeway in 1958.

 The Civil War (TV-Mini Series) has a 9.4 on imdb. Might be worth watching 




 I hope it has good laughs like the first. 




 No, this isn't a superhero movie. It is just a movie about people with supernatural powers and lots of dumb decisions by them. 




 What's your favorite Sidney Lumet movie ??

 Usually, most Kubrick films are like this. One guy gives an explanation and another gives a new one. This is why open to interpretation movies can be really refreshing to watch and are discussed constantly. 









 Looks a bit like 'The Help' too.

 8.4/10 - IMDb

89% - Rotten Tomatoes

4/4 - Roger Ebert

Criminally under-appreciated is a bit of a overstatement. 




  Don't you people miss this documentary, keeps you on the edge of the seat until the very end.  




 Although Al Pacino and Sean Penn have not starred in good films in the recent years, they did some landmark hollywood films in their prime. Al Pacino has The Godfather Trilogy, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Serpico, Heat and many other great movies. Sean Penn is a bit of an inferior actor compared to Al Pacino. But, has directed some great movies and also has starred in classics like Mystic River, Carlito's Way. 

Well, Bruce Willis on the other hand is a bit of a wild card. He can really shine in movies with good directors. But, seems to be having a tough time finding a good role in the recent years.

 A tough choice between Daniel Day Lewis and Joaquin Phoenix. 




 Why does Kubrick keep copying Nolan's style and grittiness ??? Our savior needs to protect his underrated gems with copyright. 




 That makes her a terrible person too right ?? 




 Well, she wasn't really helping Ben Affleck with anything tbh. Even the police are shady as hell.
