 "At the end of the day", "hemmin' and hawin'", "low hanging fruit", "touch base", "reach out"....pretty much any common business phrase. 




 Right before I wrote this comment. Did-ya hear it?

 Anything in particular you want to be remembered for?  




 Apparently you haven't smelled it. 




 Why do you get up in the morning? What are you hoping to gain before your time is up? 




 SnapChat 




 Don't do it unless you have plenty of cash reserves.  




 You have to work with boring computer programmers all day. 









 Ever get stuck in a "locked conversation" where the other person is talking but never asks any questions and you can't get away easily? Annoying! 




 Have you ever tried that? 




 ..... 




 Office politics, useless conversation that goes nowhere 




 Go for Felix Douglas. Can't go wrong there. 




 Does a polar bear make a good pet?

 Having to interact with them in person 




 Turbolax :-) Just one teaspoon for fast, effective relief 




 Should you take a dump with the toilet lid down? 




 Try Google Chrome 




 What if I'm interested and want to watch, but still find myself dozing? 




 How so? 




 Is it wise to fart in an elevator full of top-level executives? 




 Does a walrus make a good pet? 




 Is the library a good place to practice yodeling?

 Start a company. It's the #1 way millionaires are made. Specifically, a web-based business.

 Should I look for OTC meds to help? 




 Trying to flatulate 100 times by the end of my vacation 




 Diet consists of peanut butter, chicken sandwich with guacamole, salad, and oatmeal. Should I be concerned? 




 Is it crazy to drop a cell phone in a port-a-john? 




 Ironically, Mark is the one who invested in Rapid Ramen. I think it was more about the entrepreneur's drive/determination. He seems to look out for the hard workers, since he was in the same situation (i.e. trying to get his companies off the ground). 




 I think 19 Entertainment basically "owns" anyone who appears on the show. Even if a contestant signs with another label, 19E has the right to "manage" and get a cut out of profits.

 What are your favorite quotes from the show?

I particularly liked "What, do you want to sing Kumbaya? This is business...get to it!" from the 10/4 episode. 




 Is it greedy for Fox to take a cut of American Idol record sales they helped generate? I don't think so. These shows make people famous/millionaires overnight. Not too much to ask  to take some profits back to pay bills.

I understand Cuban's point, though. Some entrepreneurs might not be in a position to give up additional equity, and the sharing clause deters them from being on the show. 




 Coming in unprepared. 




 Daymond is worse, in my opinion. He rarely invests and frequently talks down to entrepreneurs as if he's the king of everything. 




 More like 2.5 hours, according to Cuban. 




 Not necessarily. Viewers may like/buy the product, regardless of what the sharks say. 




 2% profit or 5% equity. Either way, being on the show increases sales sometimes 10-fold, so might be worth it. 














 You made yourself lose by picking him. 




 It's not the end of the world. 




 Work on a better hedging strategy, the rest will fall into place. 




 Do cows make chocolate milk? 




 Worrying won't do any good. Will you care a year from now? 




 The bird's the word 




 I agree. What was the thinking here? 




 You might be overthinking it 




 Is it dumb to fly a kite during a hurricane? 




 On second thought, Bryan Cooper might be better. 




 My vote - John Tarr, can't go wrong with him 




 Valid concern. Wendy's Spicy Chili can really impact performance after 3-4 bowls 




 Might want to try a hedging strategy to offset potential losses 




 I agree. What's being asked is superfluous 





























 Talking about the original 8-bit Nintendo system. What game do you wish was made but never was? 









 River City Ransom 









 Not sure why this has so many downvotes....it's awesome! 




 For sure, Mach Rider 




 What a coincidence. I have the same problem. 




 Actually made it myself without granny's help this time.  




 Yes siree 









 Did you have any business/technical challenges building and/or scaling the site? 









 This goes far beyond mildly interesting 




 Anybody been sued for leaving something out of your website Terms and Conditions? 




 Office Space 




 Don't do it unless you can afford to lose. Way too volatile. 




 When someone asks about my AskReddit pet peeve. 




 Should be based on the potential smell of the fart. Mild, airy farts are OK. Rotten egg farts are a definite no-no. 














 "I'll give you half the money you need for twice the equity you're offering" 




 Yes, I think he would be the least likely of all the sharks to donate money to charity. He's greedy with a capital "G". 









 If you can't build a prototype yourself, you'll need to use a site like Freelancer.com and have someone build it based on detailed specs. BUT, before talking to anyone, have them sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement).  




 Sending a letter to yourself was basically useless even before the patent rules changed. You can send an empty unsealed envelope to yourself before you have an idea, and then add a letter and seal it later. Will not hold up in a court of law. 




 What type of business, if you don't mind me asking? 




 Unorganized with finances or everything in general? 









 Or buy one from eBay/Craigslist for $10. 




 "It's a one-year membership in the jelly of the month club.'

"Clark, that's the gift that keeps on giving the whole year" 




 Funny how Amazon released this "news" that isn't supposed to take place for at least 5 years on the day before Cyber Monday. Coincidence? I think not. 




 Classic! 




 Enjoy! 














 What about TV shows with intricate plots that require critical thinking? And what about the health aspect....still sitting in the same place while reading/knitting. 




 I can't say... 




 A toilet 




 I'd have to agree. Disagree with scientific research that says "all TV is bad." 




 Checking Reddit Front Page 




 TV gets the blame for people being overweight/using less brain power, but if you're sitting for the same amount of time doing something else, aren't they the same? 




 Flatulence 




 Plan my first appearance on SharkTank as a big wig investor. 




 Wow. Very romantic. 




 Or maybe he would feel right at home? 









 If nothing else, they made Reddit Frontpage, Top 10.  









 Man, there really needs to be an NBA Jam game for mobile. Could be a great pitch for an upcoming show. 




 The ratio of sharks to pie is too large.
 




 "Do you want to sit around and sing Kumbaya?" 









 Some deals have probably gone bad, but I would think most are way in the green. Any idea how much they've made? 




 Still, he seems to think his time is more valuable than any other Shark, and ironically, he probably has the least net worth. 




 Daymond is the only one who seems to do the shot clock on every offer. 









 Fingerprint 









 LOL, too funny 




 Price is Right Theme Song, 'cause I dig it! 




 Because they're so overused and annoying! 





























 I think we just created a playbook for other countries here. 




 Apparently he read the article. 



















 As if we didn't already know 









 Bahahaha! Good one 




 Wow, spot on. My pet peeve is random "drive-bys" at my cubicle at work.  




 What are you hoping to do/experience/accomplish while you are here? 




 Mostly looking for new website/app ideas, but open to anything! 




 Instant down vote. Can I multiply it by more down votes for you to have any sort of up vote? I think not. 




 OK, let me hop in my time machine to illustrate this "real-world" example 














 Just going to go out on a limb and guess you probably don't watch any type of sports either.

 And become a mountain man with th3battula?

 What does that affect injuring yourself? 




 We'll say boxers, extra runny poo with stark white pants to make things interesting 




 Bahahahaha! 




 You have no spare clothes. 




 Pretty much.

 Amazon used to be really good with shipping even without Prime. I don't mind waiting 3 days, but man, 1 week+? 




 What if I told you this is the worst post I've seen all morning 




 Better tip for Amazon users - shop elsewhere. Amazon's shipping has been slow as molasses for every order I've placed this past year.

 True.

 Gift cards 









 Hmmm, wonder what the correlation is? 




 Call now... 




 Did the guy who made these based on Office Space make millions? 




 Only takes one idea to make a million dollars. And a lot of time and money. And effort. And luck.  




 True. There could be worse, but I haven't heard them yet. 




 Google- 




 How does it work? 




 Brilliant 




 That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life.
