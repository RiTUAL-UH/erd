 as far as I can tell, winter, summer (which it is currently and he drove past just recently) 




 the guy who drives the icecream truck around my area does seem pretty happy.  




 Ha, could create some awkward situations. 

So these are now on my list. Thanks! 
My list is growing, and I'm really focusing on these few words/ sounds. *thumbs up*

Edit: kinda reads like I want to create awkward situations. I didn't mean it like that.

 




 I know, and I admire your guts and bravery.

  I accidentally de-scabbed a cat once, no pus involved,  but I couldn't eat anything for a few days after. So gross. So very very gro...*retch* 




 I feel so awful for you, what a shitty thing to happen. I hope it works out and those horrid people don't get anything from you. 

Don't blame yourself too much, I know people who have eloped after a short amount of time and have been happily married for years with no signs of trouble. You trusted someone, that's not a bad thing.  




 I think you fuck up is picking your cats scab. I'm going to vomit now.

But good on you for caring about your pets, but gross still. gross. 




 this.

I'm vegetarian, but if I had to eat meat it would be hunted, wild, free range (legally killed).
I will never ever eat any commercially, mass produced meat, that is barbaric and something we don't need to do. 
Use this as as opportunity to educate your wife. 




 hahahaha. 
Thanks, I had a good giggle at that. 
I am adding them to my list.  




 thanks for the links: checking them out now.

and taking note of schwul and schwl  




 noted, thank you.  




 I'm not really worried, just curious, also I think knowing small things like this will probably help with learning pronunciation generally- give me an area to focus on and perfect, while avoiding embarrassing situations.  




 I've been laughing at this out loud for a long while.  




 I was 21, would definitely take it back, it was awful. It was about 5 in the morning and as soon as he was done, I got dressed an ran all the way home through the rain, freezing cold, crying, it was terrible.  




 This reminded me of when a stranger said to me "you have a black and white cat, do you miss him?"

I do have a black and white cat and he lives at my parents so I rarely see him, I do miss him.

Once the man walked away I checked myself all over for cat hairs...none...He was just magic.  




 When I travelled over to the US, I got very drunk, had a super bad hangover, so my friends left me at the house of one of their sisters to sleep while they went out. 
I woke up after a nice nap and realised I had absolutely no idea where I was or how to get to my friends. fortunately the friends sisters housemate was home and gave me some water, offered me a bread roll, let me pat his dog and gave me directions. 

He was nice.  




 Saw a lady had twin daughters one called something like Kate- normal, not at all wtf...

Her twin: Twinae. like Twin-A, like the doctor labelled her that on the scan and the parents thought "lovely, perfect name for our child" 

Also know a lady called Gay Crack. 

also:
Anytime a parent chooses "Nevaeh" a part of me dies.  




 If my parents truly loved me, they would have named me this.  




 I was just doing some reading on language for uni, one example in the reading was about how people who speak English as a second language will avoid saying certain words (example was 'sheet') because they worry about pronouncing it wrong (example:sheet becomes shit), and asking "Where can I buy shits?" is a bit embarrassing, I guess.

I'm currently an Australian learning German, are there any words that I might have this problem with? I'm finding German pronunciation to be quite difficult, particularly 'ch'  




 Have you watched Louis Therouxs "A Place for Paedophiles"? Because if no, you should, it's pretty depressing.  




 When I was in school (year 9 maybe) I got in some trouble after a teacher found stuff I'd written about modern medicine and how it's counter-productive to the continuation of a healthy human species. 

But, if I had a serious life-threatening condition I would not hesitate to seek medical help, even if it's natures way of saying "you're weak, we don't need you"

I was an angry teenager, my views have relaxed a lot since then 




 100% yes, 
When I was a kid I got really upset when I learned I couldn't freely travel the world.
Why? This is my world, I want to be a part of it all. 
 




 anarchy all the way 




 But then when the elderly inevitably die, the world loses them anyway, and hopefully if they have anything valuable to contribute to society, they already have in someway and recorder or passed on their knowledge. 
The young are full of unknown potential (many of them may be completely useless) but losing them is potentially worse than losing an elderly person who's value we are already aware of.  




 I've never thought about this, but it kinda makes sense, even if I feel bad for saying it.  




 There should be a one child policy in all/ most countries, the population of earth is already at unsustainable levels in some places, and it's only getting worse. 




 thanks, I'll check it out. 
I sometimes play youtube videos for them, like 'count the trains' kind of thing. they get into it, but their counting goes something like "two two two eight eight eight eight ten!" But they are enthusiastic about it, it's cute. 
 




 In case some talented women wish to grow a nice mo, Manuary is exclusive, Movember is inclusive. 




 yep, and they are improving, but slowly.  




 got confused by 
Blacks and whites
vs
African American and proper terminology

 




 I have never heard of sensory vests, sounds interesting.

They do have visual schedules, but the boys don't really pay too much attention to it.  




 of course, I wont think of them any differently if they have ASD :) I have worked with autistic (and other disabilities) children before, and adored them all. 
unfortunately, even with that experience, I struggle with the twins. My sister (their mother) told me yesterday that she had to wrap one twin in a blanket and hug him for a while to calm him down because he was trying to destroy the house... I think having to resort to things like that makes her question her parenting. 
we have tried time out, other calming techniques with them, but they don't really work. but i think preventing the tantrums with fun activities is the way to go. 

so I will check out r/autism, might find many more ideas and advice. good suggestion, thank you. 

I have been trying to figure out how to get bean bag supplies and make them before thursday (when i see them next), but maybe I will just get them to throw their teddies instead haha. might be an inside game... 

and thanks for talking, it really is helping, and making me feel a lot more positive about things 




 no official diagnosis, although Autism Spectrum has been mentioned. 
They are great kids, I feel bad watching them struggle when their other siblings are doing so well, watching their sister who is 2 years younger than them doing better in a lot of areas than they are is really heartbreaking, and they are at the age now where they are aware of this. It doesn't take much for them to lash out and turn violent from frustration. 
I really like the bean bag idea, it's so simple but seems like something they will enjoy, and I think I could even make the things myself, so that's this weeks project.  




 Hello and thank you!

Yes, they see a speech and physical therapist, so I think they cover a lot in their sessions, speech, enunciation, posture and eating/swallowing etc. 

Thanks for the suggestions, I'm heading off to google to do some research, they really seem like excellent ideas, and I truly appreciate it. 

I just worry about their development, and I know their parents do too, they also go to kindy one day a week which they are benefiting from, but I think more home activities will be really good for them. 

thanks again 




 Don't wear clothes, your body needs to 'breathe', you'll feel much happier and healthier that way.  




 Gosh yes, my family doesnt approve, but since cutting my sister and her boyfriend out of my life, I feel far less stressed.  




 makes my head hurt too, what memories, thoughts, dreams, hates and loves are in that brain?  




 Hi parents,

I'm an aunty to four year old twin boys (and their 6 year old brother and 2 year old sister) 
I babysit them 1-4 days a week while their mother is studying. 

The twins have severe speech delay, they talk at about a 2yo level, although they are intellectually normal, their speech affects their behaviour I believe, they get frustrated very easily and it doesnt take them long to go from quietly playing nicely, to throwing bricks at each other. 

I have no idea how to entertain them, they wont sit still for long, they wont read books with me, they like to throw things, so its hard to play organised games with them, they don't really follow instructions very well. 
They spend most of their time digging in dirt in their backyard and playing with trucks or cars. 

Outside play is good for children, i know, but I feel like for their development they need a variety of activities but I'm just stuck for ideas. 

their parents also have no idea how to entertain them. 

thanks  




 has it been useful? good quality? worth using? 




 Use realeastate.com.au or domain.com.au to look up rental places, lots of share houses listed regularly or units, you can search by map too which is helpful 




 Uh, excuse me,  but South Australia was founded my people of good character only.   




 not interested because she's crazy. go with that.  




 this- plus
I'd recommend stopping the drunken sexy times with her- if you are looking for a serious relationship with her. You need to back off a little because I don't think its a healthy way to start a relationship.  




 the egg that made me began inside my mums mum, which just weirds me out 




 why is it bad for children to have sex when they will grow up to have sex anyway? 

some things are wrong 




 I havent played murder in the dark for so many years. Next time I'm with a group of friends....  




 I would have closed the door and found a new toilet to use, I admire your efforts and determination.  




 reminds me of the first time I got really really drunk, I tried catching fireworks, nearly vomited on a sleeping friend (missed by cm's), sang a few childrens songs, begged for my mum...
While I thought I'd just got a bit drunk then went to bed quietly. 

Put me off raspberry and coconut flavoured things for a long long time, 5 years later and it's still iffy.  




 looks challenging, I prefer the simple, already coloured books.  




 I agree, it's not a good scenario, but that poor guy is desperate to help is child, its a lose- lose situation.  




 TIL if you hold the mouse under a foot while waiting at the door, then meow normally, the humans will let you and the mouse inside.  




 naw, I get regular hugs from a red kangaroo and regular bites from the greys.  




 once an elderly couple ignored those signs and tried to overtake my dad (truck driver here in aus), the car got stuck under the front of his truck and he pushed them a few 100 metres down a busy main road because he didn't see them there, he wasnt aware until he stopped at lights. 
He pretty much covered the front of his truck in mirrors after that.  




 Dying is bad for her, the smoke is nothing in comparison to a serious illness.  




 the sounds they are making are just...blergh, so gross.  




 And it does take so long. A long boring repetitive task.  




 "blatantly stupid" might do it 




 are you sure you aren't being lied to and you are actually in some kind of 'home' ? 




 well, it was released... but not necessarily unharmed, fear and stress can easily be fatal for kangaroos.  




 yep, kangaroos growl and hiss and cluck and tsk and bark.  




 As a female, I have one shaved leg, one hairy leg because I got bored.  




 my life is a series of half-arsed attempts 




 There's a good lookout spot in vista, just up from cyress crescent I believe.  
 




 My dad once asked if I wanted to go surfing with him, I told him "No, I don't want to get eaten by a shark"
He replied with "Live until you die" 

I still didn't go surfing though, but I try to not miss out on fun things due to fear.
Living a good life and dying young must be better than living a dull life and dying old.  




 So this is a little old,  but thought I'd add... try a darker hair colour, brown would be safest by dark red could work too, grow your hair a little longer and try a wavy style, go to a stylist to get this done and get your eyebrows waxed and tinted. 

Braces probably too, if it's possible,  it did so much for my appearance.  
Good luck 




 I like the beard too,  but I think you should grow your hair out a bit,  then wait for the braces to come off and you'll be fine.   




 Agree. 
Although, as a beard lover,  continue to grow that stubble out, not too long,  just enough to define your jaw area. Ace. 

Then punch your 'friend' again.  




 I love it! A plot I wouldn't have even imagined, it's great!
It was positive and depressing all at the same time.  




 Hey look, there's me.  
My head is hurting trying to understand how I am 'in' this photo.  The worlds so big and I'm a puny human 









 Recently my friend was grieving the death of one of her rescued kangaroos,  the other kangaroos all came and put their hands on her and stayed with her as she cried,  even though they aren't really cuddly animals most of the time 




 This warms my heart, what a lovely dog 




 A few years ago I was walking my two dogs,  ones a mix breed (monti) and the other a dalmatian (maisie) who was very intelligent and a lovely dog.  
Anyway,  as we were walking monti was a little further ahead of me and maisie, Maisie starts slowly creeping up on monti,  obviously planning to pounce on him. 
As she was getting closer, mont turned around to look at her and she instantly switched to a casual jog, looked away from monti and acted like nothing was going on.  As soon as monti looks away maisie starts her sneaking again.  
This repeated a few more times until maisie got close enough to jump on monti.  
It was hilarious to watch,  I think it really showed a sense of humour and planning beyond what dogs at usually given credit for.

And another:
My parents had two galahs (parrot), both unable to fly that lived in their backyard,  every morning (that I observed) they would sit up on the roof of their cage and watch the sunrise together. Like really just stare out at it and occasionally groom one another.  So romantic.   




 Peter III of Russia caught a rat that had chewed at his toy soldiers.  After a trial, the rat was sentenced to hanging,  on the gallows Peter III built himself.  
Although I think this is more a wtf-you 




 I wanted to be a teacher and now I'm studying to be a teacher but it's not my dream job anymore.   




 I think a lot of things that are or could be labeled as supernatural could potentially be just othernatural, the universe in infinite and if we consider the possibility of other dimensions, then it will likely be impossible for us to really know or theorise about everything that may exist. 
eg- ghosts, I don't really believe in ghosts as they are described in horror/ popular stories, but I can accept that the chance of them existing in some form is possible. 
We don't really understand conciousness as it is, it might be that our conciousness continues on in some form after we die. maybe then we find out what living in a 2D world is like or something. 

I think I am more supernatural agnostic rather than believe though.  




 i guess that if you spent x number of years expecting and believing God will be there for you, you will not easily break that habit. 
I have never believed in Gods, I have never felt the need for external higher power assistance in my life because I know that any help I need will come from the physical world around me, or from me. 

I have always believed that prayers are simply positive thinking, and positive thinking is benefitial, so I don't see anything wrong with you still praying, even if there is no God to answer you.  




 I feel like having a colour one would give me the ability to paint like van Gogh...right? 
I associate colours with numbers,  but it is pretty mild and sometimes vague so it could basically not happen and I wouldn't notice.  

Are they boring personalities? 




 As someone said,  a suicide hotline, or a hospital,  police,  teachers if you are at school, there should be a lot of people able to help your friend. 
In my town (in Australia) there is a number you can call to speak to a psychiatrist,  and they do house visits also. You might have something similar in your area.

 Life is short 




 Put a pasty in the oven today for the crispy pastry, gave up waiting after a minute and microwaved it and had to deal with the soggy pastry. Life is hard 




 My boyfriend has very few memories of his childhood and is amazed when I recall various things from mine. I remember my first easter when I was 11mo. That's probably my earliest memory.  Chocolate.   




 Don't deal with it alone, contact his family or friends and remove yourself from the situation. 
Your friend is not responsible for him or his life, do what you need to to get him help and then leave and don't feel guilty if the worst happens.  




 Agree with this, take some time, talk to your boyfriend, talk to your family. Don't let those awful disgusting people dictate your life.  




 I have felt like this a few times, like I have completely messed up everything beyond repair. 
But I never really did, after a few days or weeks or months things would improve, because I wanted them to, not because I was lucky or whatever, I worked really hard to get my life back on track.
 




 Oh gosh,  mine seems quite alright compared to that.  I love monopoly,  life without it must be hard.   




 1. Grapheme-colour and Sound-motion
2. When I was young, 7-10 maybe, my sister gets some versions of synesthesia also, we were discussing once what colours various numbers were and our other sister didn't know what we were talking about as she doesn't have synesthesia, but it was a few years later in my teens when I learned about synesthesia.
4. It's sort of neutral, doesn't help or hinder most of the time. But the Sound-motion makes me dizzy sometimes and I would gladly do without it. 
5. I sometimes will choose things based on their number, or avoid them for the same reason. eg. I have an appointment for the 20th and not the 21st because 20 is a nicer colour (pastel purple/pink)  than 21 (brown/ green, kinda camo) 




 Hi everyone, 
I'm just wondering if anyone else has a negative experience with synesthesia, as I mainly read about it as a positive thing. 

I have mild grapheme-colour synesthesia, which doesn't bother me at all, but I get sound-motion synesthesia really bad sometimes and it makes me feel really dizzy. 

basically, it just sucks, and with all fun forms of synesthesia, I get this one.

 Sometimes a fake one would be preferable. But she is 100% real.  




 I've pretended to be religious, or at least pretend to not be atheist...which I guess is the same thing... in lesser situations. 
The thing with religious people is they fear losing something (eternal life or whatever) if they renounce their religion, so they would rather die than risk losing that. 
For me, there is no after life, there is only this life, why would I give that up?  









 "No!" Replied the mother,  "just flush like everyone else" 




 TIFU (a few years ago) when I went to do some shopping, a very frail looking old man came up to me and asked if I could help him with his suspenders-
One strap at the back had come undone.
Being the super helpful member of the community that I am,  I said 'of course!' and clipped the strap back into place.  
The old man turned to look at me with his gentle, sweet old man face,  held my hand and said 'thank you, dear', in his quiet and quivering voice, turned back around and walked off. 

Then I noticed I'd clipped the strap of his suspenders onto his underwear instead of his pants. 
Gave the poor man a wedgie. 





























 How do they do it? About 90% of adults I know obviously have no idea what they're doing and the other 10% either have it somewhat figured out or are really good at pretending.  




 Huh.. I'm going to try that 




 I'm nearly 26, still not sure what I'm doing.

 10th. I've heard stories of how he's said similar things to other students, and people have complained but he's still teaching. 

Edit to add story: one girl, about 15 years old, asked him what subjects she needed to do do become a nurse, he told her to just do easy subjects because "let's face it, you're not bright enough to be a nurse" 

She's currently in uni studying to be a nurse    




 I hate being to hot to sleep, or even think.  




 Yep, just need time and patience.

 Summer time. Please, take it away.  




 As a student with adhd and depression things were generally a struggle. 

I was falling behind in one subject, but one weekend I was determined not to fail and spent all my energy working on and finishing two assignments. It was hard, but I did it and I was really proud of myself. I handed the assignments up on the Monday. 

 After a week or so, I hadn't got any response from the teacher so I asked him if he'd marked them yet. He said:

"I haven't looked, I'm not wasting my time because I don't know if it's worth it" 

Crushing. It's been 10 years since he said that and it still brings me to tears.  




 Same here, I'm nearly 26 but not ready yet.  




 I dream of running away, building a cabin and setting up a vegetable patch. But that's an unrealistic, useless dream. 
So I just keep trying, failing, trying, failing etc 




 I'm so sorry, it's a constant fear of mine that by boyfriend will do the same to me. 

Depression sucks, and is so misunderstood, or not understood at all and people without it can be incredibly insensitive. 

I hope you will get over her soon and find someone much much better in the future. 
 




 I currently feel exactly the same, it's awful. And my boyfriend says stupid unhelpful things like "you just need to do it, it's not that hard" "you're better than this, just get started" "it's really very simple" 

I get more depressed thinking that I will constantly fail, and that I'm just not meant for this world, or this world isn't mean for me... 

If you discover a miraculous cure, please share! 
 




 Freezing their tits off? 




 The dogs photo! It looked so innocent. 
 




 If they used that power to do bad, then it would be rational, and yes, some do intentionally do very bad things, but the majority are good, and use their power to help people, they shouldn't be feared because of a few bad people. 

And not all medical professionals have powers to make life or death decisions, and the ones that do have strict laws controlling them. They are highly educated people who's priority is to maintain life in a way that is best for the patient.  




 I'm sorry you're going through this, and I can't help. 

Maybe try a different doctor, some are insensitive, some are really good, I learned this though experience, it took me about 5 doctors until I found one that actually cared about me. You might be able to ask others from your area (online?) if they can recommend someone really good for you to see. 

Medical professionals aren't anything to be scared of, they really can help. please try everything, don't give up. 

 




 I'm not an expert, and I obviously don't know your story, but are those fears irrational or valid? have you spoken to a medical professional about it? or sought any other form of outside help?
Suicide is not your only option.

Please seek professional help, you shouldn't have to live in fear and you shouldn't have to think that killing yourself is the only way to fix it. 

I hope you will be ok.  




 I will remember reading it. 
 




 a grand total of four, and I hope to keep it that way.

 And we're always here if you have questions. mostly...I guess. ..yeah 




 In South Australia hand raised kangaroos can not be released into the wild and males must be desexed. I dont know the laws in the other states.

They are loving animals, and make great companions but not great pets, they have poor immune systems and can die suddenly without presenting any signs of illness, so it can be difficult to treat them for illnesses, they cause a lot of heartbreak, my friends who care for kangaroos probably lose two to everyone one that lives, it doesnt get easier, it's awful every time. They also bite (HARD) a lot, and kick and can't be toilet trained or anything, and need a lot of space.  




 I would say, read through this subreddit, read the comments, check the most popular posts etc. 

You can probably learn a lot that way. 

Maybe also check out some Australian tv shows, movies or books. I cant think of anything right now because I'm tired, but I'm sure google can help.  




 is there a website for it? It looks amazing.  




 cotton eye joe now stuck in my head. thanks a lot!  




 can you link it to Australia too? cheers 




 I learned way more gory/depressing/horrible facts I  from watching/ reading Horrible Histories as an adult (It's may favourite show) than I did from history lessons at school.

As an Australian, I never learned much about the way aborigines were treated after European settlement until I started university. At school it was all "they do dot paintings and use boomerangs". In uni I learned about the massacres, raping, stolen generations, them being classed as fauna, so many horrors. 

 




 I need one of those little wrinkles. or big ones. I dont mind, so cute! 




 She shouldn't have to act on them if he really cared about her and their relationship. But either he isn't taking her seriously or just doesn't care enough to listen to and follow the terms of the ultimatums, which I don't think can make for a healthy relationship. 

OP, don't feel guilty for putting yourself first.  




 I get vouchers regularly for grocery shops! Excellent 




 The one where Bruce Willis (?) Plays a taxi driver and there are aliens and he saves the world in some stupid way. Stupid movie.  




 Today I have been thinking a lot about how my life sucks...

But something like this puts it into perspective. To live in fear of and be murdered by your own family... I can't imagine the horror.  




 if you've already given him a couple of ultimatums and he still hasn't realised your serious, then he probably wont ever. 

You need to do what is best for you.  




 Snow White and the Seven dwarves came through my bedroom window and used magic to freeze me and take away my voice. 

I had that dream when I was about 5, so 20 years ago.  Still remember it super clearly and maybe a part of me is convinced it was actually aliens,  it seemed so real.   




 Not too extreme. Homes have been lost,  and countless innocent animals,  it's lucky we have excellent warning systems and hopefully all people stay safe and alive.  

Starting a fire during this weather means a person is either an unbelievable idiot or evil (or both). The world can do without those people.   




 Its horrible,  they get one fire out only to have a bunch more start up. Can't imagine the stress for those directly affected.  




 Hoping no lives are lost in this fire.  




 Its gone for a swim 




 It is a good plan,  maybe it needs more time to prove effective.   




 Thanks, I'm following that now.   




 I'm in hope valley, so not in immediate danger from what I can tell. Not stopping me from freaking out though.  

Edit: the cfs say they expect a wind change,  do you (or anyone) know what that means,  will it push the fire towards the suburbs or back onto itself or something?   




 You too.  




 I'm not in the grey area.  :/  




 Can definitely smell the smoke now.  Be safe everyone.   




 Me either,  keep refreshing the cfs website and Facebook for updates. I know a few people who have received cfs alert messages telling them to take shelter. It's so scary and real.   




 I don't smell smoke or see any thing... its about 10-15 km away from the Anstey hill area I think but I don't know what that means a far as a fire is concerned. 




 37 is the cool change after a heat wave. 
 




 Does any one know the chance of it getting near Anstey Hill?  It's not too windy,  but still hot out and I'm scared.

Firefighters though. .. Brilliant People.  1:30 am and they're out there saving lives and land. 


Also, the middle picture is beautiful,  in a terrifying way.   




 I hate that summer makes me hate jackets, jumpers, blankets and other cosy things.  Because I want to love those things.   




 Hope you find him,  maybe post on the fauna rescue of south Australia Facebook group, they might be called if someone finds him 









 Works well, but then you realise that the sharp stinging pain in your nostrils is being caused by the swelling of the tampon as it absorbs more and more blood, threatening to spilt open your nostril.  
But then at least your have a tampon to soak up that blood...  




 Do you have a favourite?  




 Its illegal to feed meat to pigs in Australia 




 thanks! 
that's a lot of info, I don't understand much of it, but I will do some research based on what you've told me. and I'm currently downloading Stellarium, which looks pretty neat and might keep me up all night. 

I've edited my original post to include some photos. 

As I'm new to telescope use, honestly, just looking at the moon is exciting, but knowing there is so much more to see... I want to be able to see it. 

I'd happily save up to buy a new telescope, but because this one was my papas, I want to be able to use it but make it better.  




 My grandfather was a keen amateur astronomer, and owned a few telescopes, he passed a few years ago but only recently has one of his telescopes been found (no idea where the others are/ if they still work)

I know absolutely nothing about telescopes, but am interested in astronomy. 
the label on the telescope reads:

 Denkar Astronomical Reflection Telescope

D- 3" F=600mm 

coated optics

and the bit you look through says "H 20mm"

what does this all mean? I set it up last night and got a good look at the moon, but viewing stars/ planets etc is no better than with a naked eye. 

Are they any ways to increase its power? additional thingys or whatsits? 

Or would it be cheaper to just go out and buy a whole new telescope to get better viewing? 

thank you

 I don't get why this view is so controversial, when it's obviously true. 




 The females are. They're smaller, gentler, have the pouches full of adorable babies. ..


The males are mostly docile unless threatened. I bet Roger up there would rather nap than punch someone in the teeth. 
 




 Not geniuses but not stupid either.  

 




 Bring frightened and confused by vehicles doesn't equal stupid, they are quite intelligent.   




 tbh, I'd skip Adelaide, maybe head down to Kangaroo Island instead, it's a beautiful spot. 




 You definitely require a permit in all states, as you do for all native animals that you wish to kill or take from the wild. 

Edit to add: Indigenous people can hunt without a license though.  




 They are not a pest at all. 

Edit: "More recently, consecutive reviews of the state of knowledge on the management of kangaroos
have failed to correlate kangaroo control to meaningful damage mitigation to pastoral properties or
the landscape in general (Olsen and Low; Olsen and Braysher; Herbert and Elzer)."

and

"[t]he main reason
an industry is approved is almost certainly because of the extent to which kangaroos are regarded as
a pest (Pople and Grigg). It is this construction of the kangaroo as a pest that has facilitated the
growth of the kangaroo industry, yet the view is based on ignorance, mistaken assumptions, and the
influence of vested interests in current practices."

like "gay is bad", "global warming is a myth" "ALP is a good political party" 




 Selfies...

Well I hate a lot of more important things, but selfies are really infuriating me lately.

A close friend keeps putting them on fb with stupid faces and I have been liking her less and less each time.  




 Mine is a pretty boring story, but still confuses me about 3 years later. 
I was driving with my mum from one sisters house to the other sisters house, about a 40 minute drive. 
When we got to our destination, I went to the toilet, saw I'd pooped my pants a little...

No idea how it happened, didn't feel it happening, didn't feel the need to poop. Hasn't happened since, luckily. 
 




 I also pick, mostly when I am stressed/upset/angry etc. I used to have to put bandages around my finger tips because I would pick at the skin around them until it became too painful to use my fingers. 

Also, my cousin who also has ADHD used to pull out hairs one at a time, mostly her leg hair and eyelashes. she also picked at pimples a lot when she was a teen. 

I still do pick at my fingers from time to time, but I used to do it without even realising, I somehow became more conscious of it, and would be able to stop myself before I caused myself pain, just by focusing on what I was doing and asking myself what it was achieving, why was I doing it, should I keep doing it or should I stop. It doesnt sound like much but its helped. 

I have also read that having something to fidget with helps, although I haven't tried.  




 oooh yes, these people suck.

oh, looks like my friends baby is seriously ill, better go on and on and on about how my child is seriously ill with the common cold and take them to emergency. 

Now I have an amazing ER story to share with my friends! 




 - Discuss your disgusting sex life with people who really don't want to hear it

- Chew with your mouth open

- Have loud arguments in public places and make everyone else awkward

- Drive like you're the only car on the road

- Give yourself a nickname

- same pose in your million selfies

- take up a whole couch when other people need somewhere to sit

- make fun of things other people care about in conversation with those people

- scream abuse at strangers for either no reason, or if it's you who's in the wrong but you wont admit it.

 




 I don't understand. Surely North Korea knows its mostly hated or at least disliked by the rest of the world, having one movie banned isn't going to change that.  




 I know a few people like this. mostly good people, but have a terrible habit of thinking they know a lot more than they really do.

I don't know much about colour blindness, but I assume it affects your life, career options, appreciation of flowers (?) and it isnt fair to have it dismissed like it's nothing important.  




 a very mild spicy smell, mixed with dirt.  




 Not really obscure, but not common I guess... I have worked at grain silos, it was really very satisfying work, hard and tiring but fun also. 

My favourite thing was when the silos were being emptied and I got to climb inside and sweep out the remainder... even though it was like 40 degrees celsius and difficult to breath with all the dust. satisfying. 

Also involved a lot of draining of sludge after rain, picking dead animals out of the grain, sweeping, admiring views, imagining how if during a zombie apocalypse, the silos would be a great place to hide out..etc. 




 yes, seriously, I don't get why everyone keeps saying that kangaroos can't move backwards, because I have seen them do it SO many times.  




 My parents pets. Although, the bird just refuses to leave and the cat moved in after its previous owners abused it to near death. 




 My sister kidnapped a cat from her neighbours once, they couldnt even look after their kids, their cats (yep, multiple) were suffering and dying.

Kitty is now my best friend 3 




 Contact her best friend/ close family member, hopefully she already has herself, but just be sure she isn't alone. 

Hopefully what she said was just out of grief and shock and not a serious threat of suicide. 

I obviously don't know the whole story, but from her point of view (I am guessing) you've taken away a whole future she was anticipating and now she has to start all over... 

Sorry you've had to go through a tough break-up, I hope you can both move on as easily as possible.  




 You constantly forget you've made yourself a hot drink, then remember once it's gone cold. 




 Food slightly past it's used by date
 




 yep, exactly, probably 100% of teen movies/ tv shows will have some scene about a father loading his gun or something before his daughter goes on a date. 

I don't like it, but if society says this is ok for dads to threaten teen boys, then it's ok for a dad (OP) to threaten a teen girl 




 Suicidal 




 I have had hundreds over my lifetime. 3 this week. I get them when it's hot or when I have a cold, it's annoying. 

This 'talent' (?) has only been useful once, when I was working at a shop, I hated it and I wanted a break for a while. I knew that a slight bump on the nose would cause it to bleed. Voila! 15 minutes hiding in the toilets. 

they started when I was 4, I had ITP, that got better but the blood noses stuck around. 




 I have only one time, I thought my friend was asking the kettle for a cup of tea, thought it was hilarious, laughed, went to sleep.

Also, I never thought to use ginger, even though I know it's effective for motion sickness, thanks for the suggestion! 

 




 I get painful, crushing envy when I see men with long luscious eyelashes. 

Such effortless beauty. Damn you.   




 My dad is also a driver,  he's never been diagnosed but I'm pretty sure he has adhd, my psychiatrist agreed. 

 Amazing!

Maybe driving is the way to go.   




 I feel exactly the same a lot of the time, I do have depression also, and if I forget my medication for that these feelings intensify. As someone has suggested, maybe get checked out for depression.

Although, I do feel like these thoughts, as depressing as they can be, are not necessarily the result of depression.

I try to not have these thoughts as a negative thing, but rather as a positive. Use them to inspire me to work through the dullness of general life while planning on doing more exciting things later. Eg. having a boring job now will give me the money I need to travel later. 

I would love to move to the country (overseas maybe) and set up a self sustaining property to live on one day. 

How about we put together all our money and resources and buy a tropical island! who's with me?! 
























 I was thinking this same thing recently, and came to the conclusion that we need both subconscious and conscious control of our breathing or we would quickly die. 

for example, if we always had only conscious control of our breathing, we would die as soon as we fell asleep. 

and if it was only unconsciously controlled, we wouldn't be able to hold our breath, like if we were underwater, our body would be in control and continue to try and breathe.

 I'm in Australia, so maybe not helpful, but I dropped out of high school, I've had some no experience required jobs, travelled and am now studying at university. 
I don't think dropping out affected me much at all.   




 I'd assume they could survive in either places. But neither animal would travel the length of the globe without human assistance. And they exist in those places for the same reasons that gorillas live in Africa and kangaroos live in Australia. They evolved there, they're specially adapted to that particular environment and have had no reason to migrate to other places of the world   




 Same story. Incredible! 




 I didn't see anything but relatives on the eyre peninsula said something spooked their kangaroos. one escaped and two are injured. They also said other people are talking about seeing a bright flash.

 Nah,  you were an orc. weakest link (because of your vision) do they had to get rid of you.   




 I'd recommend Optus, for mobile phones, I've had the best experience with them,  good constant signal, reasonably priced,  good customer service. also Telstra and Optus are the only companies that work rurally,  if you wanted to travel around and use your phone I'd recommend sticking with either of those two.

 my mum yelling "wake up! The phantom rabbits are back!" 

I jumped out of bed in a panic, freaking out and wondering what weapon I needed to defend us from the phantom rabbits.

 I used to go in and manually sweep and shovel out the grain from the bottom of the cells, that was only a few years ago but since then they've made it a lot safer, only trained people can enter the cells and they use the electric sweep. 
 




 That's horrible, sorry.  




 South Australia.  viterra.   




 Its not too risky,  one guy I knew of was killed by a truck,  and that was a freak accident,  otherwise it's pretty safe, they employ some very stupid people sometimes who manage to stay alive easily.  




 Sorry to hear.  There are dangers but also many safety precautions.  
I also know of a few people who have died in farming accidents,  it's tragic,  but you have more chance of dying in a car,  life always has risks 




 She,  and barleys the worst,  so I avoided that when I could,  wheats fine.     




 Its not that dangerous,  I broke my arm once but that was my own fault. 

And one man was run over by a truck and killed. 

But not that dangerous.   




 Not offended at all,  and maybe you're right, who knows what advancements can be made in this area.  
But in my mum's case, her pelvis is too narrow, even though I was only 7 pounds at birth, I wasn't going to fit. I'm not sure how many non barbaric methods could help in those kinds of situations.

 I used to leave hidden 'treasures' all over the place when I was a kid,  but I don't remember what or where.  But some day someone will find them. 

 




 Some people are over weight due to medical reasons, illnesses, medications, syndromes can cause sudden rapid weight gain. 

my cousin gained a lot of weight recently and was diagnosed with PCOS, she had been skinny her whole life to that point and the weight gain caused her to develop severe depression,  which she is now medicated for, side effect of the medication is weight gain.  

She is overweight,  but shouldn't be shamed.  If you shame all fat people,  you're also shaming people who honestly have very little control over their weight.  She's losing weight but it takes a hell of a lot longer and is a hell of a lot harder to lose it than gain it.  

But also, shaming people isn't going to change them,  or help them, it just makes them feel awful.

 throughout my teen years I didn't care about germs at all, I hardly ever washed my hands, even after touching things like bus seats, covered in all kinds of gross. I would get mildly sick about once every 18 or so months and only for a day or two.

since I've started to wash my hands regularly and I'm not going out in public as often, I get sick every few months. 

so, exposure to 'germs' plays a part in building a strong immune system.

 This is a good way of looking at it, I deal with my problems on my own (or ignore them, on my own) although sometimes I wish I had no responsibilities, I do ok mostly.  




 I envy you, I see a lot of people that have just one of those things, but not doing well with the others, like good job but bad relationship, it's rare to see someone who has every aspect of their life under control and then also enjoys their life.

 It is genetic, but in the same way that other physical characteristics  are genetic,  like hair/ eye color,  height,  etc. But we don't say all people with  blue eyes are a different race to people with brown eyes.  Skin color is an easy and obvious way of separating people  into groups, and so over time we have become  accustomed to doing that.   




 This was asked recently and someone gave a good answer that was really easy to understand.

Edit: " Although there were many other females living at the time of Mitochondrial Eve, none of them were able to produce a direct, unbroken line of females to any present-day woman. In other words, all the other women at the time either died or gave birth to only males at one point in their lineage. Since mitochondrial DNA is only passed down through females, all these other lineages met dead ends if a mother gave birth to only sons. Mitochondrial Eve is the only female who produced a lineage of women that lasts up to this day. Thus every female alive today can trace their mitochondrial DNA back to this lineage."

 Unfortunately its because  people  don't tend to care about things that don't directly affect them,  even if its the death of thousands. 

Ebola is a good recent example of this,  when it seemed to no longer be a threat to the developed world  we stopped caring.  




 Yes,  you will always observe light to be moving at the same speed regardless of the motion of the source or you, the speed of light is a constant of nature, you could never catch up to or overtake a beam of light.   




 Sometimes it's just a side effect, not necessary, but not avoidable either. Such as bombing industrial areas, ships etc to hinder the enemy, there will likely be many people/workers at the location that are killed as a result.  

Killing also obviously reduces the number of people to fight against giving you better odds at winning. 

In a lot of cases it isn't necessary but gives a strong message of power, and can hasten the end of war.  The bombing of Hiroshima  killed many in awful ways but possibly  prevented far more deaths by ending the war sooner.

 It isn't actually an island, its not a large body of rubbish floating around  and it's actual size is only estimated, it might be smaller that what you say.  

It is mostly very small particles, and the occasional larger piece suspended  in the water (below the surface) and not usually floating  on the surface. so only the larger pieces would be visible from satellites,  and they are scattered over a very very large area.  




 It is considered a miscarriage although it usually happens without the woman even missing a period, so she wouldn't have even known it had happened.

 same, 26 is fast approaching and I'm freaking out about being so old. I wish I was 21 again.  




 I very much understand this feeling. 
I constantly hear ' you need to love yourself first' and I know, deep down, that it's true, but when I feel like no one else can love me, I conclude that I must be worthless and don't deserve love from myself. 

I'm working on that though, the replies in this thread are really helpful, and giving me some perspective. I hope we both move past this awful feeling.  




 this is perfect, thank you so much. I'm going to print it and hang it on my wall. 
It's all simple, but exactly what I need to hear, and I'll remind myself of this every day.

 That sucks, I'm sorry that happened to you. 

 




 I try, but sometimes in those really down moments, I wish there was someone to take over caring about me when I don't have the energy to. 
 




 nah, I'm good, thanks anyway.  




 it does make sense, hard to put into practise sometimes though.  




 I have a bearded dragon, not the same, but he is nice anyway.  




 Thanks for answering, and you make a lot of sense. I will ask myself that question, and work on finding an answer.  




 this is a good point.  




 I'm in Australia and I'm not sure that we have anything like this, but I'm going to look into it, thanks.

 I have never been the most important person to anyone. I've never felt like I'm needed, just me, for filling a space in someones life that no one else could. Everyone in my life has someone else that could easily take my place and it makes me feel so useless. 

I know there are people who care about me and love me, but they also care about and love other people equally or more. 

I feel like if I was in that sinking boat scenario with a few other people, I would never be one of the people chosen to live...

Edit: Thank you for the replies, they have truly been very helpful. In really dark moments, when it feels like no one cares at all, it's amazing to know that people, even strangers, are there to help. I'm taking on a lot of what has been said and I can already feel the difference it's making.  




 I think people would get tired/ bored of living for too long and suicide rates would go through the roof.  




 they aren't.  
























 I watched a documentary a while ago which was about 100+ year old japanese people and they were all interacting with little kids,  like running races with them and playing games, they said it helped keep them 'young'. It was only a small community but they were one of the happiest groups of people in japan.

 Well, I have a big girly crush on Bill Nighy, he's brilliant, but he is 40 years older than me.  




 I dont think it's shady, people swap doctors etc. all the time for lots of different reasons. 

It does make sense, that we haven't adapted to this high pressure, academic kind of lifestyle, which is why I think a psychologist would be useful to see, because it is stressful and discouraging at times. But on the other hand, if you do have ADHD, medications really really do help. But some people don't take medication for it and work on other calming and focusing techniques. 

Do a bit of research and read through other threads on this subreddit for ideas of how to deal with studying, and work out what you think will be best for you. 

It is a pretty confusing situation, with the different opinions on ADHD out there. I honestly didn't really think it was real until I was diagnosed and saw improvements in my studies on medication. 

 




 Oh.. no... but I want to knock it.  




 you can tell a lot about a person by what they throw out.  




 defenatly this 




 one time I was travelling alone in the USA (I'm Australian), I was in a motel and there was this pretty overweight guy playing cards on his own, there was no one else around, he asked me to join him. We played cards for a few hours, then went our separate ways. This was 6 years ago, but I still think about how wonderful that guy was, he was beautiful.  




 except the people who are jerks and don't deserve respect. 

But I like what you're saying a lot. I would like that better too.

 oh wow, thats expensive. Sorry it didn't go as planned. 

I'm not exactly sure what you should do. Maybe try a psychologist but keep searching for a better psychiatrist. It's excellent that you got the referral and the appointment so easily though, maybe you will be equally lucky in the future. 

I just did a quick google search, and it looks like there are quite a few psychiatrists in brisbane who specialise in adult adhd. Write up a list of names of any close to you and take that to your doctor. 




 it might be due to the oil left from your hands that dust and dirt settles on and sticks to.  




 probably because their minds are crowded with other every-day thoughts.  




 let me know how it goes, if you like. And you're welcome, it's always useful to have someone to talk to.  




 yeah, demand that referral, it really sounds like you need it. 

It sounds exactly like what I go through, the coloured notes, taking for ever to get work done and being too alert of my surroundings. exactly the same. so annoying. 

I didn't research drugs much, but my psychiatrist did give me some information sheets on the different ones available. its excellent that you've been researching it, I think it really shows that you're taking this seriously, I hope you doctor sees that. 

I think it's a good idea to take in your uni work, you might not need to show it, but it's good to have 'evidence', i dont think it will work against you. 

Good luck with your doctors appointment. :) 




 my psychiatrist gave me a few options for medication, but I only recognised dex, so i chose it just because of that and he didn't have anything bad to say about it. 

I know how you feel, about putting so much effort in to everything, it gets really tiring, it's not fun at all.

I'm not sure if psychologists can give referrals or not, sorry. But my psychiatrist recommended I see a psychologist as well as take the medication. I only had one appointment though, I wish I'd stuck with it, but I just couldn't be bothered I think. it wouldn't be a bad idea to look into seeing a psychologist too, and I believe you get 10 free sessions a year. 

Just be honest with your doctor, and be demanding if you have to.  




 you're welcome

 Back in nineteen-dickety-doo, my great grandfathers family died of starvation trying to Makens meat. RIP, you brave souls.  




 they don't exist 




 I'd suggest you start looking now, and try and find one that will specialise in ADHD, when I was searching I found that there were quite a few around so hopefully you don't have any difficulties with that. It's just that some don't believe in ADHD for whatever reason, my cousin sees one who doesn't believe in it, but she lives rurally so has no other options, he's very rude and condescending. 

The dosage and type of medication will vary. I chose dexamphetamine, and my psychiatrist recommended I start on 20mg a day and then increased it to 25 after a while. It will depend on your body and how severe your possible ADHD appears.  




 All of the above, anything that has a significant positive or negative affect on a lot of people and is 'news worthy ',  just without all the fear mongering,  the dramatization, the appeal to emotions, the propaganda, i just want the facts,  i don't want to be told how to feel about it. 
 




 The plain, simple,  facts. 




 I'm in Adelaide, and the long wait seems pretty standard, between 1-4 months so you might get lucky. 
And the script is for 6 months but you only usually get 1 or 2 months worth of drugs at a time. 




 Due to hormonal and physical changes in pregnancy  




 Yep,  the script is for 6 months worth of medication. the wait for psychiatrists is generally a few months, it was three months between getting my referral and having my first appointment.  I'd recommend you get onto it soon because it's likely you'll have a long wait also. 

Try not to worry about what other people think. This is your life and you have to do what's best for you,  its hard not feeling good enough,  constantly failing or struggling. Get to a psychiatrist asap, and even if it turns out you don't have adhd, I'm sure they will be able to help you in other ways.   




 it's probably different with different psychiatrists, but my first appointment was 1 hour, where he got me to answer a bunch of questions, then we discussed my family history, my personal/social/student life and such. when he had determined that I indeed did have ADHD, he told me about the different medications and therapies available. He recommended that I go on medication because it was really affecting me, i was failing uni classes, so I chose to go on dex, just because I'd heard about it before. 

the appointments after that were only half hour ones, where he asked for an update, gave me my new prescription, then we talked politics until the time was up. 

I thought it was good that he gave me option other than medications, but that he recommended that I take them. 

 




 I think it's fine, and it is what I did. Doctors are there to help everyone. You are hopefully just over-thinking this and it will actually be a very simple process getting into a psychiatrist. 

It sucks that there are those people out there who ruin things for others, but hopefully medical professionals can tell the honest ones from the liars. 

Also, my psychiatrist charged $70 and my appointments were every six months, so it was pretty affordable, but I was getting youth allowance and had a centrelink health care card for the medication discount (something like $5 down from $30) - if any of that helps. 

Explain everything to your doctor if you feel the need, or if she asks, like your mother not believing in it, having to save up, be honest and open about how your studies are affected. 
 




 I'm Australian too. If you're really concerned about being judged, you can say it's for your mental health in general. University can be very stressful even without additional difficulties with ADHD. If you aren't lying to get your referral, I suppose it doesnt matter which one you go with. 

Also, I looked up psychiatrists in my area that dealth with ADHD, as some wont, or don't think it exists. important to find someone who will listen to you. 

Although, if your doctor is half decent she shouldn't be judging your reasons for seeking a psychiatrist.  




 I want a monkey hug. what a cute little kid.  




 I'll wait until your future AMA, so I don't feel like a weirdo PMing you a long list of questions. :D 




 thats weird that they have a weight limit, dogs can be good or bad behaved no matter what their size. 
Glad you got to keep your dog, I would hate to have to give up a pet due to housing, it would be heartbreaking.  




 I'm not an expert at all, but I would say it's definitely worth getting checked out. 

I worried about that too, people assuming I just want drugs, but my psychiatrist asked me a lot of question, about family history and everything, and I suppose I could lie about everything, but he seemed certain that I had ADHD and thought it was unfortunate that I hadnt got diagnosed earlier, because I really fell behind in school. He then told me that dexamphetamines can sell for up to $10 per 5mg, which seems like a lot, but I didnt find out. 

I would tell your doctor that you believe you have ADHD, maybe do a few online tests (I know they are diagnostic, but there are pretty accurate ones out there) and take the results in, I did that and the doctor agreed that I should be checked by a psychiatrist.  




 oh wow! I can't even imagine what that must be like. was it hard to accept? You should do an AMA, i could ask you a million things. 
 




 You sound a lot like me, very very similar problems. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 23 after suspecting it for a few years. 

I think you should tell your doctor that you want a referral, not ask her, but straight up tell her. She can't refuse to. 

But also ask her about ways to help your memory and organisation, because learning those things is really important to, and she might have some good techniques that can help.  




 I want a dog. worst part about renting.  




 what did you have amputated? why? I always feel awkward around amputees, not that I see them often, but I am curious and want to look, but don't want to offend them by staring. I never think anything negative about it, only curiosity.

 Hi all, 
One of my fb friends has discovered one of her flying foxes had been stolen from a locked cage in her yard. 
If anyone knows anything contact fauna rescue and the police. 

She rescues and rehabilitates flying foxes that are orphaned or injured, many came into her care during the last heat wave.  She cares a great deal about each one.  
 




 Even Adelaidians and rural south Australians have slightly different accents.  




 Some places will experience colder weather than usual while others will experience hotter than usual, but on average the temperature will be hotter by 1 degree. 
Its the severity of the weather that is the concern, more extreme weather that is causing the rise in temperature.

This is a pictute of me before   starting day 1 of 'Zombies 5k' 
I've tried and failed to lose weight numerous times over the years (im 25, been overweight since my early teens ), but i recently reached my highest weight ever and i realised how important it is to get healthy and lose this weight.  My starting weight was 107kg in November, since then i started the keto diet and am now 97kg. Now I'm increasing my exercise. 

Im hoping  that by sharing this that I will  have more motivation to stick to my weightloss this time and finally be successful, i want to put a progress picture alongside this one and see real change in my body. I want to lose this weight and I'm going to lose this weight.  Hold me to my word reddit.
