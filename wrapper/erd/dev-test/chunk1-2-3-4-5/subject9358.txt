 Hadn't heard the word anhedonia until you mentioned it, seems fitting. I do genuinely try new things all the time but I just can't find a single thing I'm good at. I want something I can do when I'm bored or stressed or need to unwind.

Can't go back to therapy, it's too expensive. It was great but I felt like I was paying money to talk to a wall. My therapist never gave me feedback. 




 So happy for you, that's great! I really want something like that to come along for me 
























 Adventure time :) 

I would go back but it's so expensive. It's almost a day's wages for an hour session of just taking to someone who doesn't talk back to me.  




 I bought a drawing software for my tablet recently and I've been kinda...doodling haha. 
























 I find it really discouraging when I don't make progress though :/ I took up guitar too actually, no clue how people play it. music is really mathematical to me. 




 Wow that bird is gorgeous! 
























 I like that advice â™¡  




 Yeah I have heard that. I just couldn't afford to at the time. Nah, I don't. 
























 Yeah I'll definitely give that a go. I definitely feel like I have a creative mind but just nowhere to release ideas onto and it's frustrating me. I just don't feel like I have a "thing" to enjoy or relax me. 




 Haha sport has the opposite effect on me! I'm overweight and seriously unfit even though I've done gymnastics, ballet, dancing, yoga, cycling, running...you name it. I gained weight a few years ago and despite starving myself within an inch of my life and increasing my exercise I haven't lost any weight in two years. I'm now eating normally and doing Pilates 3 times a week on top of a job where I can't sit down and I've actually gained.

I wouldn't willingly exercise though. I find it boring.
