 Agreed, they're just being open and honest about their sexism against men. However it does look like they want to make the existing gender justice gap even wider than it is at present. 




 I'd also love to hear the reply and appreciate you taking the time to challenge this. However, I certainly don't share your optimism about it being fixed.

The Greens started out as a somewhat idealistic but ultimately quite likeable party years ago. However, over the years they've gradually been infiltrated by groups for whom environmental concerns were secondary a best. These groups use the "green" label as a way of hiding or rebranding less palette able agendas such as communism and extremist feminism.

Unpleasant and idiotic feminist ideas are today deeply ingrained in the Green Party and the problem goes right to the top, with Lucas previously making a number of sexist statements and more recently carrying out ridiculous page 3 censorship stunts. I've challenged Lucas on her sexism several times in the past on her website, not only were my comments ignored they were also then censored too.

At the very least I don't see any chance if this policy being sorted out while Lucas remains in charge, though I'd live to be proved wrong. 




  I see a lot wrong with sentencing men and women differently

Without wanting to defend the Green party's blatant sexism, your sentence describes something that already occurs a lot of the time. Unlike feminist myths such as the "pay gap", the justice gap is a genuine phenomenon, and men receive significantly longer sentences than women for commuting exactly the same crimes. The entire justice system blatantly favours women at every single stage, not just sentencing, but in terms of the likelihood of being charged or even arrested for the crime, with district violence being a particularly notable example of this.

A couple of years back MP Philip Davies gave perhaps his best ever speech in parliament, completely all the myths about the justice system trying women badly and proving that the reality was the complete opposite of what many feminists were claiming. I strongly recommend people view or read his speech.

So, although the green party policy is sexist, disgusting and hateful, it is at least fairly honest, and arguably rather more so that the present situation. 




 These same feminists who only want to send men to prison usually pretend to favour shared parenting. However, in reality they actually tend to be the ones doing more than anyone else to scupper any attempts at introducing shared parenting legislation or any sorts of equal rights measures for fathers. 




 I'm not too sure how successful a complaint would be. She's not a BBC employee therefore under their rules she has more lee-way when it comes to saying disgusting things. 




 Quite surprising to see a show such as these address the issues of male dv victims in a genuine and fairly honest way.

I don't watch daytime tv but, can certainly recall this show as being fairly notorious for its misandry in the past (something that tends to be the case with countless other women' panel showss.

Anyway, the panel looked quite a bit different and somewhat younger than it used to be, so hopefully most of the worst offenders have lost their jobs and therefore the show isn't as much of a stain on tv broadcasting as it used to be. 




 If feminists think a lack of women in STEM fields cases discrimination with regards to healthcare then how the hell do they explain what's being going on with cancer research, treatment and care for the last 40 years?

Breast cancer has seen mass screening programmes, immense research efforts and patients getting by far the best care of any cancer patients.

Prostate cancer on the other hand has been severely neglected, virtually ignored at times and although things are slowly improving, these issues still persist to some extent even today. Arguments against funding prostate cancer research these days use the fact that the understanding of the disease is someway behind other cancers such as breast cancer. One of the main reasons such understanding is poor is because of the vast neglect seen in past years. Therefore cancer researchers are neglecting prostate cancer patients today, simply because they were also neglected previously!

If money had been spent sensibly and targeted at saving the most lives possible, then some of the billions we've spent on breast cancer would have gone elsewhere and more lives would have been saved.

We're not talking about a trivial points here either. Prostate cancer deaths are set to overtake those from breast cancer in the near future. The numbers involved and the disparities in funding mean we're talking about discrimination against men on an absolutely vast scale. 




 Someone in Canada made some nice posters a while back in response to these. They switched the genders and sometimes the topics too (such as false allegations). It caused quite a stir in the media. 




 Note the name at the bottom of these posters.

Vera Baird is a notorious radical feminist politician who was previously the MP in that area. She got kicked out by voters at the last election but she then stood for the role as police and crime commissioner, an election in which hardly anyone voted. She,s heavily involved in various awful feminist organisations and seems to have spent most of her previous legal career representing women who murder their husbands or kids.

J4M B have complained previously about her awful domestic violence posters, and these rape ones aren't half as bad a those as far as I can remember. 

Anyway, the point is that there's an extremist feminist in charge of all policing in the region in question, so sexist poster campaigns are an inevitable consequence of this. 




 This year:
Matt O'Connor of Fathers4Justice
Tom Martin of Sexism Busters
Brother K of Bloodstained men (assaulted once on camera and also falsely arrested at a different incident)

A couple of years back:
Daddy Justice assaulted on camera by feminists dv campaigner at dv conference

Historical incidents:
Neil Lyndon assautled for writing critique of feminism in the 90s with feminists also openly saying they wanted him shot 




  I have complained about many issues to the BBC but to no avail.

The complaints process sucks but it is possible to win if you use all available channels. I've had at least 3 successes against the BBC, the latest one was probably the best so far:

https://hequal.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/victory-bbc-backs-down-over-dishonest-rape-victim-headline/ 




 This is particularly good advice for anyone involved in our movement.

I can think of at least 4 men's human rights activists who have been assaulted, either by feminist or politicians, and three of the incidents occurred this year.

Those without recordings have faced false arrest and charges and even some of those with recordings have later faced arrest (off camera).

If you do one thing today, please fully familiarise yourself with the video function of your phone so you know how to use it instantly and without thinking. 




 If we're going to complain about men being killed by police then we'd need to pick a far better case than this one.

I'm all for defending even the most awful men when they've been clearly wrong by the police / courts, but there doesn't really seem to be any real injustice in this case whatsoever.

Getting behind shitty people who haven't even been wronged would make us look like idiots and harm our cause. If anything, it's the officer who's been treated harshly, perhaps not by his employers, but certianly by the lying media and much of society. 




 well they probably don't get all the "positive" discrimination that's found in more prestigious a jobs. So I expect female plumbers have it worse than the far more privileged females elsewhere. 




 The best record? They certainly have some of the best people when it comes to challenging feminism, but those a somewhat small in number and they do have the likes of May who's almost as stupid as your average Labour feminist and no better when you look at the polices she introduces.

The Conservatives don't even support shared parenting yet, and there's no way they deserve support as a party.

Why not check out the actual Conservative candidate in your area (and those for other parties) and see if they fully support men's human rights or not? 




 Would be nice if the article gave credit to whoever forced the retraction. Exposing these feminist lies is really important work. 




 There are also regular protesters there engaging with people in a more serious manner. I think a variety of tactics is a good thing - there's something for everyone. 




   it didn't seem that people were paying much attention to what they were trying to get across

In another one of the videos a woman describes overhearing a conversation indicating that AAP had warned all those at the convention not to speak to any of the protesters.

It wasn't the nature of the protest that stopped dialogue - that had already been put to a stop regardless what tactics the bloodstained men used. 




 There's a previous video of a guy arguing with him about the protest. It might be that guy who called the cops? 




 The foreskin doesn't' usually retract on babies or even young children, forcing it to do so causes significant harm as it is fused to the glans, you have no idea what your'e talking about.

As for FGM, there are multiple types of that, some more harmful than MGM and some significantly less so, but all are clearly 100% wrong. It's abhorrent to cut healthy and important tissue from babies, regardless of their gender, it's their body and should be their choice. 




 You completely misunderstand the point. The harmful mutilation you describe is completely illegal in most of the world and those carrying it out are subject to vilification and prosecution.

Switch genders, and similar harmful mutilations to males are encouraged, carried out by those supposed to be protecting children, with vast profits being made from this sexual abuse of babies. 




 Probably slightly unfair to that guy at the end who opposed circumcision, but otherwise seems like a good way to make the medical community think twice about some of the terrible things they're doing to kids. 




 Here's a video of his release from jail:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqQrONzR-IA

Apparently the charge is now "obstructing government operations" whatever that means. 




 So you'll do whatever it is that other other people do, regardless of ethics or evidence?

That really sounds like a feminist way of thinking. 




 The term "men and masculinities" is almost exclusively used by man-hating feminists nowadays, the only thing more obvious would be for them to promise to address "toxic masculinity" (A more subtle/modern way of saying all men are rapists).

They're not being totally blatant about what they stand for, at the very least they're completely clueless or alternatively they know  exactly what they're doing and it is a genuine feminist attack/hijack.

I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you do come across as quite naive in all this. Please be careful if you engage with these people as there a pretty high chance that their aims and agenda are probably the total opposite of yours (and if theirs aren't then it's probably the case for whoever is pulling the strings behind the scenes) 




 Great idea. You could make it into the ultimate shirt by stating that 10% of the purchase price would be donated to men's human rights organisations. 




 The best improvement that could be made to this subreddit is for some guidance to be issued for how to submit posts about hateful content.

We shouldn't be giving all our traffic to organisations who make money out of misandrist click bait and instead the content should be archived so we can still read it without giving them traffic or improving their Google rank.

If the content allows comments then that's not so bad as we can at least potentially challenge the misandry, but I see zero value in linking to hate content which has no commenting allowed. 




 The police haven't taken any action against the perpetrator, though please don't post her info as that's against the rules of this subreddit.
 




 The police were even ignoring the caution while it was still in place. For example, they allowed her to renew her shotgun licence which is pretty much unheard of in the case of someone with a recent domestic violence assault caution. 




 He has been charged with "criminal damage" for grabbing the sign which the feminist assaulted him with. He's trying to get hold of the CCTV for the area so it shows what actually happened.

Feminists are either spinning it as him being the guilty party, or saying that he deserved it


(Don't think this breaches any of the Twitter rules as I'm sure Tom won't mind this being posted here, he's a public figure, and probably needs some assitence too) 




 Well that's ok if they also dismiss all Guardian writers in the same way too. 




 Please don't even make small donations until they at least start to fix things. 




 She hasn't been charged and her assaults took place back in September so it's not looking as if the police are going to do their job unless people complain. 




 I meant the majority here don't understand what's wrong with Wikipedia. So many other corrupt organisations have been completely exposed by the men's rights community for their blatant misandry, but no one has ever properly documented the sort of things going on at Wikipedia.

It's very puzzling because people complain about Wikipedia articles more than almost anything else, but they don't look into the Wikipedia foundation itself. 




 It's a subject that really hasn't had sufficient coverage from our community, so there isn't any article I know of that covers the issue.

Everyone here knows Wikipedia is biased and that it allows and encourages feminist to add their bias/bullshit to articles. We get plenty of people complaining about Wikipedia bias but it's inevitable if they're going to hire the worst man-hating editors as staff. It's not exactly a secret either, it's pretty easy to find out if someone works for Wikipedia, but we all ignore these issues and just keep on complaining about the articles instead of discussing the root causes.

 




 People don't seem to understand just how corrupt Wikipedia really is.

Not only do the the most awful misandrists get admin privileges, many of the most notorious anti-male editors either currently make a living off your donations or have done so at some point on the past. For some reason, Wikipedia really loves to employ sexist feminists. 




  the concept of this still blows my mind. The fuck is the point?

It's so she actually goes to prison when she next attempts a violent rape and kidnapping (though if she's patient and waits a couple of years before trying again then we'll be right back where we started). 




 I think it's a great protest seeing as the AAP are in favour of child abuse. I did feel slightly sorry for the guy at the end though who said he hasn't cut a baby and never would.

They need to praise the good guys as well as confronting the bad ones. 




 It's strange isn't it. When people vehemently opposed to abortion set up fake abortion clinics then there's outrage. However, when those who oppose equality for men and men's human rights  set up fake men's groups, it's absolutely fine. 




 Whatever your criticisms about this place, it's certainly a hell of a lot friendlier and a thousand times less threatening than Wikipedia, where every single men's rights editor is targeted for abuse almost automatically now. 

There are at least 3 hateful feminists who are of have been actually employed by Wikipedia and thus given the money of donors despite their awful and quite blatant sexism against men and male editors. These Wikipedia employees have been known to break some of the most fundamental Wikipedia rules including engaging in sockpuppetry and paid editing yet Wikipedia rules don't apply to them because it is so corrupt and feminist dominated.

Feminists actively stalk men's rights editors all over Wikipedia, often for many years, hounding and goading them trying to get them banned at each and every possible opportunity. This is usually for totally invented reasons or after being goaded by feminists for so long that they finally snap or make a minor error.

I don't suppose you'll be doing much about the above, if you decide to do so, as good a place as any to start is to look in the mirror. 




 what? 




 What Google are doing is wrong, but the most outrage should be aimed at taxpayer funded organisations who took part in IWD but afield to do the same for men. Unlike Google, these organisations have a duty to help everyone and to not discriminate.

One case that comes to mind is the BBC, who have a duty to be impartial and always go overboard for IWD but didn't do a single thing or even have a single report on IMD. 




 It's not my video. 




 She hasn't faced any action by the police, here's a response video by the perpetrator (watch to the end, that's the worst part): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAddCgWSbTU 




 Read the video description - she was going to provide written proof of the supposed guidelines she was enforcing, those never arrived. Also notice that she gets somewhat physical which was of concern.

These same protesters face a lot of police harassment and have been falsely arrested multiple times too and repeatedly assaulted by members of the public, see some of the other videos.

 Apologies, i didn't spot the date as it was in such small text. However, please keep your comments to the subject of the material in question, rather than commenting on the person submitting the material.

People in the men's human rights movement have a great deal of interest in in a number of medical matters, and their level of knowledge of such subjects if often extremely impressive. 




 Or attracted more feminist/brainwahed readers than your average Daily Mail article? 




 The UK has provided some of the most important and groundbreaking groups/individuals in the history of the men's rights movement.

- Fathers4Jusitce forced the current debates on shared parenting and the right for children to see their fathers.

- Justice for Men and Boys, One of the few men's political parties.

- Erin Pizzey, founder of the world first domestic violence shelters, who now condemns the misandry of the very organisations she founded.

- Neil Lyndon, the author of the first modern, egalitarian critiques of feminism. 




 Please don't like to that awful site. Thanks. 




 Please don't link to these articles, archive the page instead. 




 I'm not sure if the posters went up around International Men's Day or not, but there's no doubt that they were an incredible success.

The various incidents with feminists caught vandalising the posters and even denying that men's rights were human rights are now a part of the history of our movement. 




 Why not put up posters rather than just holding them for a short while?

That has been an extremely successful tactic in the past. 




 In the UK thousands of girls, usually from care homes, are raped by gangs of roughly this size and the police and politically correct Labour councils turn a blind eye 95% of the time because the perpetrators are Pakistani Muslims (and they even threaten to arrest the fathers of the girls).

Given that Birmingham is run by a Labour council and also has a large Pakistani Muslim population, then there's a 99% that this is exactly 
what's going on here.

Really, they should have just any of the men where a conviction was possible, but Birmingham is the worst council in the country when it comes to child protection, and combined with the refusal to prosecute Muslim paedophiles, the refusal to even gather evidence and then the difficulty of getting statements from the victim, then this isn't going to happen.

Although this looks like a men's rights issue not he surface, it really isn't, and is simply about past (and present) failing of ultra politically correct police and local councils who will only arrest sex offenders who are non-Muslim.

**update** article was significantly expanded a few minutes ago, confirming everything I suspected above.

Why the hell am I being downvoted, i just successfully predicted what was going on here? 




 Something strange is happening with my posts on Reddit, they don't seem to appear in "new" yet this is now on the r/mensrights page so obviously I'm not shaddowbanned. 




 I see this isn't showing under "new" and has therefore been wrongly censored. please don't do that. Thanks. 




 Apologies for the indirect link, but i submitted this half and hour ago and it appears to have wrongly been censored. It's quite clearly far more politics related that 40% of what gets posted on here, so deleting this post is clearly totally inappropriate behaviour. Anyway, I'll assume it was a mistake. 




 Don't really enjoy most Conservative party related sites, but Conservative Women is an exception an has some excellent content. 




 and up there with the worst misandrists of them all is Lynne Featherstone, a Lib Dem! 




  Now they promote issues for women and immigrants

Very true, although its worth noting it's particularly middle class women they help. They really don't have time for the small minority of female immigrants who truly do suffer genuine oppression. 




 Really worth reading this article.

Not only does it expose the misandry of top Labour Party politicians, it also joins the dots to the people in the media giving an outlet for them to promote all their anti-male ideas. 




 I use Wordpress too (and had a good look at other options before choosing that one). 




 My advice is not to use Amazon because they insist on selling "Boys are Stupid, throw rocks at them" merchandise.

In the Uk we got most retailers to withdraw these items, but Amazon were one of the few to refuse to do so. 




 You'll get best value for money donating to a men's domestic violence organisation, almost all of them are massively underfunded and they get typically nothing from the government. The best one I know is the Mankind Initiative (they were behind that viral video of different public reactions to male and female victims). It got 7 million views. 




 Allow me to apologize for the actions of my gender as a whole!

No, absolutely not, we don't do that sort of thing here. If you still have that mindset then you've probably not quite got rid of all your feminist baggage yet.

Just because idiotic feminist men apologise for the actions of all men and blame them for the world's problems doesn't means women here have to be sexist and demean themselves in the same way. We want to challenge this kind of crap, not imitate it. 




 Lynne Featherstone is  way up there with the most stupid feminists ever. From Wikipedia:

"In April 2006 one of Featherstone's researchers received a hoax email warning about an apparent date rape drug called Progesterex.[21] Featherstone submitted a question to a government minister inquiring as to "what assessment he has made of the use of progesterex in cases of date rape". Paul Goggins replied in the House of Commons that Progesterex did not exist: "It has been the subject of a hoax e-mail".[22][23] The hoax first originated in 1999.[24] Featherstone criticised the minister's response, stating "they need to do more to discover the unearthly monster who sends them out" and that "their cavalier attitude will not do".[25][26] However, critics such as fellow Liberal Democrat James Graham castigated Featherstone's conduct in "criticising the Home Office for not having a response to made up drugs and made up crimes", stating "trivialising rape in this way without bothering to do basic research first doesn't help anybody".[27]"

"In September 2011 Featherstone caused controversy by claiming men make "terrible decisions" when they are in charge. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference Featherstone blamed men for the mess the world was in, and commentators drew parallels with similar comments by one of Featherstone's predecessors, Harriet Harman. Her comments attracted criticism from across the political spectrum and were considered particularly inappropriate given her role as a minister in charge of ending sexism. Conservative MP Priti Patel said: "These comments are really ill-thought out. As equalities minister she has got to be unbiased about the value that both men and women bring to decision-making."[39][40] Elizabeth Day of The Observer newspaper was equally troubled by the remarks, writing "the notion that women are not as aggressive as men, that we would all just sit around a table eating red velvet cupcakes and talking out the world's problems rather than firing off phallic-shaped nuclear weapons is a complete fallacy".[41]"

Finally there's this almost unbelievable quote about Female genital mutilation where she stated:

"if this had been little boys having all or part of their penis cut off the practise wouldnt have lasted four minutes let alone four thousand years!"
http://www.lynnefeatherstone.org/2014/03/fgm.htm

She's absolutely unbelievably stupid and misandrist and thankfully there's an extremely good chance of her losing her seat at the next election. 




 If the article sucks then don't link to it. Use an archive service instead please. Thanks. 




 And where are the flashing people in wheelchairs? And children?

Also where's the flashing black light for those of African descent? 




 You don't seem to understand. It's fine (if rather petty) for them to object, we're in favour of freedom of speech and you could argue the choice of clothing was slightly inappropriate/unprofessional.

Just don't EVER compare this story to the issue of genuinely harmful clothing, **aimed at children**, that explicitly promotes hate and violence against boys and is widely on sale. 




 They have no known equivalent of the "boys are stupid, throw rocks at them" t-shirt. Were ti to feature females then it would have disappeared almost as soon as it was launched. In fact, even computer generated slogans for products that didn't even physically exist were withdrawn after feminist complaints. 




 Interesting how the viral video of the guy defending himself on a train from a crazy woman ends up with him in prison for 4 days, yet not the slightest hint of any action here against a genuinely dangerous person.

The victim (Brother K) actually appears in court himself soon after been wrongly arrested at a protest elsewhere. 




 What the hell are you talking about? If it doesn't advocate violence or even state that females are stupid or inferior then it's not even the slightest bit comparable. 




 Haven't seen the shirt in detail, but I very much anything on it clearly advocates that females are idiots and should be subject to stoning or other violence because of this "fact". 




 Strange how there's outrage when these idiots have to pay for damage they've caused during a protest, yet most people were silent when men's groups were threatened with having to pay far roe than this simply to guarantee their own safety from feminists. 




 This is a premature headline. It seems to be a vote by some sort of set of elite Admins on whether to ban her or not.

Only one has voted so far, with all the rest yet to decide. 




 First video doesn't show the arrest, that video is here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1yF4oyo9-U

Apparently someone called the police and falsely claimed the protesters had been indecently exposing themselves.

Interestingly, it seems that the guy wrongly arrested also experienced wrongful arrest at the same location for a protest  back in December 1970 (the first ever anti-circumcision protest in the US) 




 If it makes you sick so much then **why are you promoting it for them?**

Please use a screenshot or archive service instead. 




 What does the text say? 




  Given from the amount of hate I see right here for English teachers it is kind of sad.

The point isn't to condemn all English teachers, most of us are simply discussing the possible correlation between being an English teacher and being a man-hating feminist.

We're not condemning all English teachers, just the minority that hate men. (and that this minority is somewhat larger amongst English teachers than those teaching most other subjects) 




 True, but why are there not just as many man-haters teaching religious studies or sports? 




 Record everything, making it clear how uncomfortable the item and her actions make you feel. Also be sure to make a point of how male are a minority group in the education system now, and a disadvantaged minority at that. 




 Why is it almost always English teachers who are the man-hating feminists?  If you look at the Duke case and the group of 88, Gender studies and African-American studies aside, it was those "teaching" English that were significantly over-represented in that hate group. 




  Think about how many guys this asshole messed up and brainwashed?

A drop in the ocean compared to what many feminists are doing, and it's not as if his activities are taxpayer funded either, that's when things are a real problem. He should be free to be an idiot and the feminists should be free to protest against him. 




 I don't really see this as a men's rights issue at all, there's so many other big stories about men's issues around right now so we shouldn't up vote this.

If there are bored feminists out there wanting something to protest against, then its far better they go after this guy instead of using violence and hate speech to try to silence good guys like Warren Farrell. 




 Well the upper thigh is remarkably close to the circumcision wound and they say the infection may have spread to there.

Either way, when doctors are treating a seriously ill child it's going to be better for them not to have to be dealing with multiple infected parts of the body and completely unnecessary wounds. And it can't be much good for the immune system either to have to fight off infection at multiple sites.

This case is probably like quite a few others in that they can't really tell for sure if it's the circumcision that killed the child or not (though its the reverse to normal in that its usual to cover up the link between the death and the circumcision). 




 Interestingly, some of these same guys protested in Tallahasse against MGM as early as December 1970, that's the first recorded intactivist protest making them men's rights pioneers.

They were wrongfully arrested at the protest all those years ago too!

Video of the latest arrest is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1yF4oyo9-U 




 And make sure you have plenty of well written posts about prostate cancer too. Also, next time say you run a men's **human** rights blog. Reminding these groups that men are human too really helps sometimes. 




 Simple test to see if the organisation is sexist or not. Simply set up a fake feminist blog and make a similar request in a few months. 




 We usually see positive stories about the Innocence Project here on r/mensrights so this certainly makes a change. It seems that at least some of their staff are more concerned about their ideological opposition to the death penalty than actually helping people. 




 No, AMR (and even some in the media) find bad people who aren't men's rights activists and then try to pretend otherwise.

If AMR and others were to highlight genuinely poor behaviour of genuine men's rights activists instead of lying 24/7 then that would be fine with me. 




 She is a feminist, so it at least can be categorised under feminist violence:

http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/dolores-oriordan-you-get-to-the-point-where-you-want-to-die-just-to-get-peace-30221192.html 




 Might be good for sales/publicity this time around though.. 




  I even have to question his objectivity in his assessment of the reaction to the book

In that article he has actually missed out quite a few incidents such as death threats, an assault, feminist book burnings, anything you can think of really. Wikipedia covers most of them:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Lyndon#Writings_on_feminism

All this "controversy" (feminist hate) meant his couldn't find work and it was even used against him in court to deny him access to his kids! 




 One other interesting piece of trivia, the "male view" magazine this article is from was one of the first mens' rights publications. It was published by the Mankind organisation, who beame Mankind Initiative, now by far the biggest and most successful domestic violence charity for male victims in the UK and possibly the world. 




 "Dishonesty is to act without honesty. It is used to describe a lack of probity, cheating, lying or being deliberately deceptive or a lack in integrity"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishonesty

There was no integrity in that headline and it was undeniably deceptive. Given the lack of balance in the rest of the article, not to mention the BBC's track record on such issues (such as the example highlighted in HEqual article) then it's not unfair to assume the deception was also deliberate. 




 It is one sided to call her a "rape **victim**". If she's a victim then it follows that the other party is the perpetrator or the rape. The BBC did indeed switch to a neutral heading which should satisfy any reasonable person. 




 I've posted it again, explaining that it's on topic and asking them not to delete it.
 




 I've been on Reddit for years and I've never baited anyone, can we actually keep to the topic in question instead of these personal attacks? 




 It's on topic and a positive story. Surely it's good to see the BBC held to account and for people to actually facilitate change instead of simply complaining about discrimination and media bias?

In some ways it's even a good story for the BBC, because while they obviously made a terrible mistake they did eventually do the right thing in the end.

Anyway it would be interesting to hear people's perspectives and I'm certainly not looking to stir anything up so you presumed incorrectly. 




 Well, perhaps she was seeking some form of "pay back" by making the allegation in the first place?

 Extremely clever move there by Erin and AVFM. 




 This article is about as relevant to this subreddit as it gets. There is no reason to remove it. Thank you. 




 I posted this article to r/columbia the other day and it has disappeared from there without a trace! I guess some of the admins there are also members of the mob in question. 




 I posted this article to r/columbia the other day and it has disappeared from there without a trace! I guess some of the admins there are also members of the mob in question. 




 Why has this disappeared from the r/columbia subreddit? 




 it's not an imaginary problem and that's not we're presenting ourselves as the solution to either. People should be free to be complete idiots if they want to, we're just aiming to be the exact opposite of them, that's all. 




 To be fair, they could just make her pay back in full the money she's cost the taxpayer, put her on the sex offenders register and then deport her.

Prison is very expensive, so that would be the most efficient solution. 




 Might have been fair if she'd paid back the entire costs of the investigation, though I imagine it would have been quite a large bill! In addition to deportation I strongly believe such false accusers should be on a sex offenders register of some sort.

Edit - as pointed out below she did target a specific male. She should be in prison, no doubt about it. 




 Nice to see the best comments below that article are the highest rated. 




 It's a fact that there are feminists out there who spend their time trying to control men to such an extent that they campaign for them to sit down when they go to the toilet. They even present "science" to support their claims that it is healthier for the men in question, all of which has been shown to be completely false.

We simply aim to be the opposite of this. 




 Well I was referring to feminists yes, but not all over them, just the many feminists who oppose the human rights of men. As i said: "our opponents".   




 Perhaps that occurs a little too often on the site, although at the same time when there's proof of any of the above then surely it's only right to name names? There was absolutely no mention of the Guardian in the first version of the most recent story that was published. It was only later that we discovered that the Guardian appeared to have broken the story, had used the exact same dishonest phrase and therefore the BBC had simply copied it. Only then did we attack the Guardian for what they'd done.

The Guardian is the newspaper of choice at the BBC and they're notorious for having similar views and angles on a story. And we haven't attacked Guardian readers, only Guardian journalists. If anything we're  helping Guardian readers by ensuring they get honest and accurate headlines instead of sexist clickbait nonsense. 




 Fixed now. 




 I complained to the BBC and eventually forced them to change the headline. Info here:

 Anti-male feminism tends to be heavily associated with the left, and there's far more to politics than simple left and right anyway. 




 not when you consider the content of the article too. For example, where are the comments in favour of actually prosecuting criminal false accusers who ruin so many people's lives. And where are the extensive BBC reports on men who committed suicide after being falsely accuser by serial offenders? 




 Just been doing some Googling and noticed the Guardian went with the same type of headline. They don't have the same obligation as the BBC to be impartial, but they're still bound by PCC regulations so could be in trouble for it. 




 True, but unlike our opponents we're not hateful sexists here and we care just as much when feminist-inspired bullshit and hysteria impacts on women too.

On further issue is that the policy would essentially force men (and women) into relationships were it to become widespread. Given the various injustices that marriages causes for men, then this could be linked to men's's rights issues. 




 it's a good job that there's no such thing as a paedophile gang, or a married paedophile, or a paedophile who has children of their own... 




 if someone is alleged to have been a victim of a rape then it follows that there also has to be the perpetrator of the rape in question. The BBC is showing extreme bias in labelling someone on trial for false rape accusations as an alleged "rape victim" 




 Well some of the content like this would traditionally be found on r/unitedkingdom I suppose, but these days anyone who isn't a left-wing Guardian/Mirror reader isn't really welcome there, so I presume people are that and looking for a more neutral Uk subreddit where all views are welcome. 




 So where's the link to this info then? 




 in defence of the feminists, the people they're protesting against don't appear to be the most pleasant bunch, though still not worthy of protesting against.

While they do look very stupid and hypocritical, it's not as if they're protesting against ones of the good guys like the blatantly misandrist feminists did in Canada. In that instance they decided someone as respected as Warren Farrell was basically Satan because he was concerned about boys not doing well in school. 




  his isn't anywhere.

Well her name is everywhere because of her parents coming forward. And yes his name is out there too, though I'm not sure when it was first published.

And if I'm assume she's mentally incapacitated and that no rape took place it doesn't mean I'm assuming she's guilty of perverting the course of justice. Perhaps she was so mentally disturbed that she genuinely and sincerely believed to have been raped when no such thing actually happened.

I think this is the crux of the matter. It seems one one really knows what happened in this case other than perhaps the accused, yet the police seem to be pressured into believing supposed victims and arresting accused rapists regardless of the evidence. Perhaps instead of this tendency to classify everything as either "rape" or occasionally "no crime" there should be quite a few more cases classified as "who the hell knows". 




 I don't see why you are taking the police's side. Did they even get to see all the evidence gathered for the private prosecution? They supposedly had enough "evidence" to class it as a rape though at the same time they didn't actually have any evidence other than the word of a highly mentally disturbed individual. Seems like very poor conduct on the part of the police to me.

Perhaps if we actually treated innocent people who are merely accused of crimes rather better than all this might not have happened. At the very least we need to see anonymity for the accused. 




 If a significant amount of time had elapsed then that points to them not having evidence in her favour either. Combined with here obvious mental issues then it's surely wrong for the police to have even classed the case as a genuine rape?

TBH it would be better if the gentleman was able to actually take action against the authorities for what he went through instead of his only recourse being to go after the accuser. 




 Well the police had no evidence to support a rape prosecution. There does appear to be clear police bias in classing this case as a rape, on top of the lack of evidence there's the clear unreliability of the witness. Perhaps both sides got it badly wrong and maybe if the police had classified it correctly in the first place and treated the man better than he might not had such a need to clear his name?

Furthermore, knowing how incompetent may police forces are, it's pretty common for them to fail to collect or take account of fairly basic evidence. Perhaps there wasn't sufficient evidence of any lies until the accused had paid out a shed load of money and had collected it all himself? 




 In parts of England customers are increasingly demanding non-Muslim drivers to cut down their chance of rape/assault due to taxi drivers and takeaway workers there raping children on an industrial scale. It's always fine when companies discriminate against male drivers simply based on misandry, but when it's race or religion and based on a very real and specific threat then suddenly all the equality organisations become involved and the media goes crazy. 




  Yeah, all what, seven?

7 suicides caused by false allegations perhaps
 




 Surely it's the CPS get to decide if there is a case or not? Why assume the police made the right call and that the CPS are in the wrong? 




 Well at least the headline writers at Sky News can do their jobs properly, perhaps they can give the misandrists at the BBC some lessons? 




  To sum up, someone with psychosis is less likely to piece together memories in a consistent way therefore putting their testimony at a disadvantage.

True, but your point means they're typically more prone to making false rape allegations too.

 I guess the guy who was originally accused of the rape wanted some sort of pay back after her story failed to materialise and hence took her to court.

"pay back" is a bit of a strange way of putting it. If a party has indeed  been subject to a false allegations then surely they just wants justice and to protect future victims from the perpetrator who had caused them so much harm and distress?
 




 Whatever the case, she shouldn't be described as the "victim". It's a huge smear on the person she accused. 




 Yes she is an "alleged rape victim", but only in her mind and a minority of others, however it's not the BBC's job to promote the agenda of a minority, particularly when its contradicted by most of the facts.

The fact that she was facing trial for false rape accusations points to there being strong evidence to this being the case, yes she's innocent until proven guilty, but that's where "alleged" comes in.

The BBC could easily use neutral terminology in which neither party is described as a victim/perpetrator, but the worst case scenario is to completely turn reality on its head and to so clearly state the accused is the "victim". Doing so in the headline is worse still - anyone just glancing at Reddit/Twitter and not clicking through the story is being severely misled by an organisation with a duty to be impartial and report the facts. The headline breaches countless BBC guidelines, and as for the report itself, where the quotes from someone with the point of view of welcoming prosecutions of false rape accusers and highlighting just how many people get away with such crimes? 




 Why the hell does the headline describing someone going on trial for false accusations as a "rape victim"? 




 Correct title is "alleged false rape accuser" 




 It gets worse, I just decide to search the BBC website for the name of the gentleman in the article above, zero results found!

http://www.bbc.co.uk/search?q=Olumide%20Fadayomi

So not only do they lie when a false accuser commits suicide, when the roles are reversed they cover up the story too! 




  Well shit, this is just unfortunate.

Or perhaps worse than that and it's typical BBC bias? 




  The title is misleading too

Exactly, made worse by the fact that BBC journalists receive money from the public and in return are supposed to report these matters impartially instead of with such blatant bias. The heading is extremely offensive to victims of false accusations, particularly the alleged victim in this case.

Here's a an even worse case with the roles reversed, a serial false accuers and the victim of the false allegations committing suicide:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1280926/Student-cleared-rape-emerges-second-man-committed-suicide-falsely-accused-woman.html

As expected, not a trace of it to be found anywhere on the BBC website. Their bias is quite incredible. 




  If the other trial was still ongoing, it's not innacurate

It wasn't ongoing, the only trial where there was sufficient evidence was for making false rape accusations. 




 Here's my complaint email to the journalist named in the article:

 to:	 Dominic Casciani dominic.Casciani@bbc.co.uk
date:	 7 November 2014 16:58
subject:	 Ridiculously biased headline in your report on alleged false rape accuser

Dominic,

I'm extremely concerned about the blatant BBC bias in the article about the alleged false rape accuser who committed suicide. The report itself on the matter isn't exactly neutral though at least not terrible, but the headline is just shocking and turns reality on its head and is extremely offensive to victims of false rape accusations. The case is quite clearly not about an "alleged rape victim" and the neutral term that should be used is "alleged false rape accuser".

While it's true that some people alleged that a rape occurred (mainly the accuser herself), the crime she was facing trial for was for making false rape accusations The BBC is obliged to report matters impartially and neutrally, and it's obvious that the key alleged offence here is that of making false rape accusations as that's the only offence for which there's sufficient evidence for a prosecution. As the article itself admits, actual prosecutions are false rape allegation are very rare (though not necessarily false rape accusations themselves of course). The fact that the courts routinely fail to go after false rape accusers thus makes the case against the choice of headline even stronger still. It's also worth nothing that the actual success in gaining a conviction in false rape cases in the few cases that get to court is very high, again suggesting that prosecutors actually rarely go after the wrong person and tend to get these things right in the instances when they actually prosecute perpetrators of such heinous crimes . Furthermore, if the BBC were to stop covering up cases of alleged false accusations by pretending the alleged perpetrator was the victim, then perhaps we'd also see a few more of these false accusers facing justice?

I'm not sure if you're the one responsible for the ridiculously biased and offensive choice of headline but the article does carry your name, and due to the BBC's failure to be transparent and provide any other contact details for the material we at HEqual will have to assume your the one responsible for the content unless we hear otherwise. Therefore please ensure this offensive and dishonest headline is fixed ASAP or forward this information onto whoever is responsible for this blatant breach of BBC policy.

There is one possible alternative solution that could be used instead of changing the headline. If it stays in place, presumably we can also expect to all future BBC headlines concerning actual prosecutions for rape to instead refer to the perpetrators as "alleged victims of false rape allegations". To be honest i don't recommend this second course of action, but the choice is yours.

Regards

John Kimble


**Update - the BBC have finally backed down**, I've blogged about the issue here:
http://hequal.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/victory-bbc-backs-down-over-dishonest-rape-victim-headline/
 




 He was bankrolling his own prosecution, though the state can actually stop him at any stage should they wish to do so. It's actually a very useful tool for cases where the police can't be bothered to get involved or perhaps where they might be better qualified person than the police to make the case. Animal welfare charities routinely use private prosecutions for example.

Also, it's notable that this case changed from a private prosecution to one by the state once the victim made it clear that he was determined to go through and that there was sufficient evidence to potentially secure a conviciton. 




 Why does the BBC headline use the term "alleged rape victim", surely the neutral term is "alleged false rape accuser" if that's what she was on trial for? 




 Why does the BBC headline use the term "alleged rape victim", surely the neutral term is "alleged false rape accuser" if that's what she was on trial for?

Are they going to start describing people on trial for rape as "alleged victims of false rape allegations"? 




 Quite a double standard here. even giving the mother the benefit of the doubt and assuming the allegations are false, then why do the children's names need changing? False allegations by mothers are pretty much an essential part of gaining custody of kids, yet the father gets zero protection in such cases with the false allegations often taken as being true. 




 Not in the context of a perpetrator being female though. Feminist organisations are only slightly reluctant to report male on male violence, it's female rapists we're not allowed to know about. 




 The victim of the gang rape was actually male, not female. 




 We always hear silly sexist arguments saying abortion would be freely available if men got pregnant etc. However, given how immensely skewed the justice system is against men, and how society holds men to account for their actions, just imagine how severe how commonplace prison sentences for the pregnant men would be were they to harm their unborn child. 




 50/50 doesn't have to be the norm. All the norm should be is that fathers play a meaningful role in their children's lives, and the courts and society accept this. Some fathers will have 50% custody, some 40% some even 60%.

There's no shame or loss of face in a hard working father, who perhaps has unsociable hours, having the kids for slightly less time than the mother, it's not a contest, that's the issue we're trying to get away from. When couples separate they should still work together and do their best for the kids.

There could even be an assumed 50/50 split but with one parent still being on friendly terms and offering to be a babysitter when the other is exceptionally busy (and grandparents/siblings from either side of the family can do the same, regardless of who's "turn" it supposedly is to have custody). It's all about moving away form this childish, combative way of doing things which involves expensive lawyers, and instead moving toward fairness and common sense. 




  I say that if all the shared parenting forces could muster was $27 grand that speaks volumes.

The "No" campaign raised zero from legitimate sources. Not a cent. $20K from one bar association and $50K from another, none of which is legal. 




 Some good points there, though you seem to be falling into the trap of assuming we want to force 50-50 parenting onto people.

You talk about "universal 50-50", as if we're feminists wanting for men to have 50% of everything, regardless of merit, desires or consequences ( like how feminist try to force women into politics or force companies to have huge female quotas on their boards)

Some men are perfectly comfortable just being part-time dads who see their kids at the weekend, and if that works for them, the mothers and particularly the kids then great. The men's movement simply wants equal parenting to be a genuine option and the default position in the absence of other evidence.

Kids should simply have the right to see both their parents and neither parent should be able to deny the other a meaningful relationship with their children. 




 $70,000 isn't bad when you consider the small size of the state. And $26,850 is not at all "similar".

Also if we remove all the immoral/illegal donations from the "No" campaign then their budget would have been zero! Every penny that received came from bar associations! 




  I doubt the actions of the ACLU and the lawyers had anything to do with this defeat

Well the result was closer last time North Dakota voted on it. It's pretty standard for the side with the most money/resources to at least have an impact on voting. 




 It can include Roma, but also Irish gypsies. Most slavery cases in the UK to date have involved the later. 




 we're approaching 100,000 subscribers, that would be one hell of an achievement 




 Some good info here: http://libertyviral.com/feminists-aclu-divorce-lawyers-opposing-shared-parenting#axzz3IAgVDWBu

If you just do a search of this subreddit for "ACLU" you'll see that it is basically a radical feminist organisation now. Things i found were that it opposes:

* making false rape accusers apologise
* shared parenting
* due process for college students accused of rape

And it supports:

* spreading pay gap lies
* infant male gentital mutilation 




 The yes vote for shared parenting (measure 6) currently stands at 37.8% with 67% of votes counted, so the bad guys have basically won.

I suppose at least if the actions of the lawyers group is ruled to be illegal as expected then there's has to be a chance of a vote again next time.

Update - now at 38.03% with 70% of votes counted, so 99.9% certain to fail.

Full detail of the proposed measure can be found on the excellent Ballotpedia site:

http://ballotpedia.org/North_Dakota_Parental_Rights_Initiative,_Measure_6_(2014)

news report on the result:

  This is Norf Dahkoda, where we love to force women to have unwanted children and refuse to let men help raise the children they love.

Actually the shared parenting measure has a lot of support. Simply having it on the ballot and therefore it being a real possibility puts North Dakota well ahead of most other states and countries in the world when it comes to gender equality for parents and children. 




 and that fathers have finally gained theirs after waiting for so long. 




  In the strict sense of averages, that wouldn't be true. If 1% of the population "paid for sex" at $200 per encounter, and all people had sexual encounters, paid or unpaid, at the same rate, then the "average man" would pay $2

No, that's the average paid by men. The average man however still isn't paying a penny. 




  you still have to wonder what other fanatic groups have done the same in their respective areas of interest.

The most obvious other example of this is circumcision-related articles which are blatantly controlled by circumfetishists and in particular by people who associate with these circumfetishists/paedophiles:

http://www.circleaks.org/index.php?title=Jake_H._Waskett 




 The "Average man" doesn't pay for sex and therefore the correct answer is zero. 




 There's not a huge amount of merit to the first link (though I seem to recall reading about "street harassment" at the time and it meets your requirement of featuring a female victim so you should like it). You're way off for the other two though.

We have charities such as the NSPCC basically campaigning against men and fathers, and all sorts of groups and politicians suggesting fathers are a danger to their own children and using fraudulent statements to make the "case" that we shouldn't have shared parenting. Therefore when women murder their own kids it's more than legitimate to post such news, more even more so when they do so using such horrible methods, and more so again when there's possible custody issues on the horizon.

As for the final link, I firmly stand by that too as it shows a child far exceeding the policing abilities of not one but two trained WPCs working together. It therefore makes a hugely compelling case against lowering standards in the police and thus effectively discriminating against the best candidates by failing to recognise and take advantage of their much needed and obvious abilities. Not only is this harmful to such candidates, the weakening of police and fire serves though such policies also puts the general public in danger (and members of the emergency services too). In summary, my concern is not so much with the incompetent police, but with the victims of their policing and with the unemployed/underemployed candidate who should have been employed in their place. 




 "If you google 'news father BBC'"
Yes if you do that I'm sure you're right, not sure what your point is though. I didn't Google anything, i just visited the BBC website and found a story on the main news page.

TBH it's not a particularly well written piece as it doesn't use any scientific terminology to describe what had occurred so it's certainly not one of my best link submissions by any means.

i've already explained my interest in male domestic violence victims and how that stems from the almost total lack of support they receive. therefore we've already established why I don't tend to contribute the type of material you highlight. I've also answered your question about what would happen if the roles were reversed, can you maybe read my answer instead of taking us round in circles? 




 You've previously implied that my human rights work makes me a potential mass murderer, message received. Any chance you could stop with the abuse and discuss the content instead of the contributor? 




  Would you have posted this article if the roles had be reversed?

Well if women made up 40% of domestic violence victims of a crime yet were denied assistance front he government/charities soley because of their gender then that would be a complete role reversal and I'm sure I'd post it.

As for your comments on Rotherham you're implying that I wouldn't have posted the story about those 1,400 victims and wouldn't have had the slightest interest if they'd simply been 4 years older whilst all the other facts remained the same. That is total nonsense though you do make an interesting point that it's men and children who tend to be failed by the government time after time rather than adult women. 




 A while back i did some number crunching for government spend on male victims of domestic violence over the previous decade or so. One finding for was that for every pound spent on male victims in Scotland there was 3,500 spent on female victims.

Not sure why this is being downvoted so here's the actual figures as of 2010:

100 million spent on female victims
28,000 spent on males

That's a 350,000% disparity. 




 Every post of mine about women? You mean such as the ones about female rape victims being ignored by the media?

I do happen to have a huge amount of concern about male victims of domestic violence given the way they are systematically denied help and support, though as highlighted above I generally have concern for anyone in society deliberately marginalised and denied assistance and justice by the state and by supposed charities.

There's numerous laws in this country that blatantly discriminate against men and I'm yet to find any that do the same to women, so yes men are usually the victims of the legal and justice system, even (or perhaps particularly) when it actually functions as designed. 




 True, but how many members of these grooming gangs are 16 (or even under 20 for that matter?) 




  a guy in the year above me at 20 dated a 14 year old for years

There isn't much "dating" going on in the cases with the grooming gangs, how many such cases later ended in the victim and groomer having a long lasting loving relationship and getting married? In fact if he dated a girl who was 14 for years, then she'd be over 16 by the end of it. Grooming gangs typically have no interest in any girl over 15.

The cases were purely about exploitation with the victim drugged or given alcohol, subject to threats and violence and forced into sex with multiple men, often 2,3 or 4 times her own age. 




 "He said she said" is extremely important usually but almost totally irrelevant here because the victims are all under 16 (and well under 16 a lot of the time). In these child rape cases the only real "she said" defence would be if the victim lied about their age. 




 In Rotherham the number of abortions resulting from these child rape cases far exceeded the number of convictions. The lack of evidence really isn't a problem a lot of the time, it's just that the police and authorities don't even try to collect it when its staring them in the face. They refused to fund DNA tests, even in cases where victims had insisted one be carried out. 




  The fact is, many people have legitimate worries that UKIP are a party that advocates, if not downright supports, discriminatory policies

Like allowing thousands of kids be raped and abused because of the race/religion of the perportrator? 




 Excellent advice, though missing a critical factor - the need to document the abuse. Men do not get believed, so proof will be required. 




 Prostate cancer funding is finally getting off the ground in the last few years. If you really want to make a different then you need to go for an even more neglected area. Male domestic violence victim is the one area that comes to mind as still being almost completely denied any funding. 




  its hard to be funny and authoritarian at the same time.

Neither left nor right wing politics have any connection with authoritarianism, so Lee's talking bollocks. The left's strict adherence to political correctness is about the most extreme and authoritarian trend we've seen in politics in recent years. Also, I wouldn't describe the Conservatives (and certainly not Cameron) as a good example of right wing, just part of the Lab/Lib/Con elite. UKIP are more right wing and their support is increasingly working class (particularly the downtrodden who've been failed and abandoned by the likes of Labour).

As for sexism, the real sexists are the BBC who've adopted blatantly sexist quotas instead of employing people based on merit therefore reducing the quality of broadcasts. 




 Well if a warning was needed then perhaps for once the vid actually was violating the TOS? 




 Well perhaps if the other videos were reported they be forced to add a warning? 




 well if it's still on youtube then what's the problem?

Literally hundreds of mens' human rights sits are being defamed and blocked by ISPs yet hardly anyone posts about that here these days. It's great that you feel strongly about censorship but if the video is still up (and has been for a while) then it really looks like a non-issue or at least something somewhat trivial. 




 Any chance of a mirror of the original please?

Is it this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtVHnZX8E50 




 Good to see there's such generous people about. I seem to recall that 1,000 funds the fees for fielding an additional candidate at at the election. 




  Not sure your argument that UKIP are being treated differently holds much water..

Well there's a very obvious successor to Tonge doing the same sort of stuff yet they are always treated as isolated incidents rather than anything to do with the Lib Dems as a whole. If the media must label and smear UKIP as racists who hate immigrants then why don't the Lib Dems get the label of the anti-Semitic party? (especially considering that they largely stood by and kept such people in the part for as long as possible, incident after incident) And getting back to the main point of the discussion, why aren't comedians in particular doing this? 




 Well to be specific, is was organ harvesting that she was concerned with by Aid workers of all people:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Tonge,_Baroness_Tonge

http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/stephaniegutmann/100025868/jenny-tonge-and-organ-harvesting-this-woman-is-scary/

Worth nothing that it wasn't a one off and she had a history of making vile comments, including stating she'd probably become a Palestinian suicide bomber if she lived there.

Note that she still gets a nice taxpayer salary and retains political power via her seat in the Lords. I suppose in fairness to the Lib deems they did withdraw the whip, albeit after about her 10th offence (though I wonder if she still retiains party membership?) 




 For what? It's all fairly common knowledge (unless your main source of news is the BBC) 




 That's largely been debunked, every party has its share of nutters at local level, just the media tends to focus on UKIP ones right now.

Labour has links to all sorts of terrorists and has covered up thousands of child rapes all because of their political agenda. The Lib Dems have anti semites who think we need investigation in Jews harvesting body parts in Haiti and other Lib Dems even blow stuff up. The Greens used to have somewhat sane politicians back in the day, but almost all seem completely loopy now (just look at the background of Beatrix Campbell for example).

the only difference i can see is that UKIP butters get exposed by the media and laughed at, whereas Green, Labour, Lib Dem and Tory ones get awards form the queen instead and/or shunted off the the House of Lords. 




 Exactly. It's not that they don't criticise Labour (albeit less strongly), it's the types of criticism and angle used that shows the true scale of the bias.

Some of the greatest sources of humour in terms of hypocrisy and generally being complete scum and/or totally idiots would be Diane Abbott, Mr and Mrs Harman, Denis MacShane all of Labour not to mention Mike Hancock and Lynne Featherstone of the Lib Dems (and their several anti-semitic politicians). The way the likes of Ed Balls and Angela Eagle constantly get everything wrong is absolute comedy gold, and to be honest a lot of high ranking Labour politicians make the idiot Tories look relatively intelligent.

I don't really watch the BBC much these days, but how many twitter porn gags have they done about the Harmans? Does anyone have a go at racist Diane Abbott other than Andrew Neil?

I recall a feature on the BBC website about various famous people who'd got caught wearing Nazi uniforms and inappropriate attire over the years. The article listed all sort of obscure figures yet failed to mention Ed Balls doing the same thing, and at the time he would have about been the most significant figure in the piece! 




 Well seeing as they want you to die at least 7 years before your wife, I very much doubt it. 




 This is getting silly. You stated that Dale Maily was a "the stereotype of the extreme end of the DM readership"

I merely asked where the Guaridan equivalent was, I didn't bring up the  "average Guardian reader" at all, just the extreme SJW feminist ones. 




 This whole report is a total sham. It's completely dishonest and unbeleivably sexist and has nothing to do with equality at all.

It gives a score in different areas, and generally where there is parity it correctly gives maximum points. However, should women have it far better in any particular area (such as usually occurs in education) then the country still gets maximum points for equality.

So a country with 100% women MPs, no men allowed in school and most of the male population slaughtered by the government will be the most "equal".

Things get more farcical still on the life expectancy measure, whereby you only get maximum "equality" score if women live 7 years longer than men! One of the reason the USA got a low score is because the gender life expectancy gap is "only" 3 years!

The whole thing is total bullshit.



 




  but they have a character who is the stereotype of the extreme end of the DM readership.

 That's great, the question is where's the equally insane Guardian SJW feminist equivalent? 




 I'm not against targeting Israel, it's just insane for hem to be taking sides so blatantly in that conflict, though it's something the BBC does repeatedly.

I acknowledge they do critique Labour, but it's clearly a token effort - i.e. just putting a bunch of subtitles onto one of his speeches. I'd expect such subtitles attacked his personality of something vague rather than the fact that he was part of the treasury when they completely wrecked the UK economy for generations to come and spent every penny we have. I've seen the pilots of this show before the BBC took it on and the bias there was even stronger. It's pretty obvious that those behind it have quite hard left views, and as with the majority of the BBC I'd guess they were either Labour Party members of at least Guardian-subscribing Labour voters.

I'm not against them having opinions, but if such opinions are so strong then it's not suitable to have the television licence funding political propaganda - it's a major breach of the BBC charter. If they want to produce a Guardian style politics comedy show then it needs to find a home on a different channel. 




 The show is horrifically biased against any institution or political party that's not left wing.

Your typical episode will attack, the Conservatives, then perhaps their coalition partners (but only really for being friends with the Conservatives). they'll then attack UKIP, then the Conservatives again, then the Daily Mail, then a few big businesses and then Israel.

There will be a token gag at the expense of the Labour Party for "balance", though nine times out of ten it will be a half-assed attempt. 




 The point is that if they're not acknowledging that females are abusive then they're saying men only get abused by other men. It's increasingly common for feminists to acknowledge male victims but to then make it clear it's only homosexual men they're talking about. 





























 It's not available in paperback form yet (or hardback either). 




 Obviously an orchestrated campaign against him, though I'm not sure who is behind it. Here's Mike's view:

https://j4mb.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/spoiler-reviews-on-amazon-com/

Update, i just realised the forward is by Erin Pizzey, someone who's done far more for domestic violence victims than anyone else on the planet. So these feminists are attacking a book fully endorsed by someone who should be by far their biggest hero.

Update 2, A quote from the feminist behind the campaign to leave all the negative reviews:

"Someone gave Mike a toothy blow job and now he hates all women. Heres a shining example of some of his work available on Amazon. Ive already written a review, sarcastically titled Good Book, Bad Fonts. **Lets Internet justice the guy who would like to legislate that less efforts be made to help girls into STEM careers.**" 



















 And the Democrats are equally gleeful if it's innocent white men locked up. 














 If the republicans would happily introduce half the J4M B policies then how come they're almost as hostile to the idea of equality for men as the Democrats? Ideas such as male disposability, MGM and locking up innocent men are all equally popular within both parties 




 This just in - advocating for the rights of boys as well as men makes you a sex offender. 









 Protesting against mutilating a child's genitals against their consent = creepy

Taking a knife to a child to violate them sexually and cause irreparable damage to their genitals = not creepy 









 Are Scientologists obliged to murder anyone who tries to leave the religion? 



















 Certainly some good arguments there, but I still think it's better to deny traffic to any misandrist sites.

Personally I sometimes link to such sites if comments are open, whereas I'd always use an archive were that not the case. I really see little or no value in visiting a hate site if can't even debunk the lies of the author. 



















 Well in a free market in a democratic country with freedom of speech, then if enough readers wish to see such content, and if such material is profitable, then it's the Sun's right to publish it (not to mention and the reader's right to view it should they have the funds to purchase a copy).

If feminists want to campaign against harmful media outlets then the worst women's gossip magazines are a million times more harmful than page 3 and much of the harmful material is outlined and advertised prominently on the front page. Page 3 is completely the wrong target, proving the campaign is misguided at best, or a stunt, or simply anti-sex prudish feminists attacking men and employment opportunities for attractive young women. 




 Page three models are forced into appearing in the paper against their will? If that's the case I suggest you call the police and report such evidence to them. 









 Makes a change from the huge numbers of mother and latest boyfriend killing a man's child I suppose. 














 Journalist who has been writing in various newspapers in Ireland on men's issues (and other topics) every so often for a decade or two. I don't pretend to have a complete picture of his career, I realise he's certainly not perfect, though still has done some good work over the years. 




 He mentioned a (different?) interview regarding the issue of rape where he raised the question of both parties having sex and both being so unable to drunk that they'd be unable to consent. Apparently the feminist refused to answer the question, claimed it was offensive and walked out! 




 That's a strange interpretation - it's the feminists who are trying to stop these women working and he's against that. 




 What a fantastic radio show, being from the UK this is the first time I've heard of Niall Boylan but he puts most UK radio and TV hosts to shame. He was civil throughout, fair, completely honest and open and had a more than impressive grasp of all the issues too.

Surely destined to get a show at a bigger radio station before too long? 









 I now have a new favourite radio presenter and his name is Niall Boylan. 









 Note that teh BBC didn't allow a debate here, they just let Mike state his case and then predictably give the feminist the final say (and make nasty insinuations about Mike's private life) 









 The same organisation that wrote this report is actually notorious for its discrimination against men. it not only bans them from many fund-raising events, it refuses to properly fund prostate cancer research.

Their reasoning for this is that prostate cancer research was neglected in the past and thus our understanding of it is still relatively poor because of this. Thanks to this discrimination of the past, there isn't likely to be a breakthrough any-time soon, so they're not going to fund current research at the same level as they do with many other cancers (such as female specific ones).

They're literally discriminating against prostate cancer patients today simply because they were discriminated against yesterday:

 Point two makes a bit of sense, as for the rest, it's absolutely incredible, particularly point 1 which turns reality on its head. 









 Article is open for comments 














 A woman actually won silver at the Olympics when the genders used to compete together. I expect the men must have raised their game somewhat since then, but it shows what's possible and such a feat could never happen in almost any other event.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Murdock

 




 Well it wouldn't be a "top team", realistically I should think a really great women's player might manage in maybe the 4th or 5th tier. 
Obviously we'd never ever see any female defenders, goalkeepers, defensive midfielders etc, but a skilful play-maker might cope at a low level.

People do tend to under estimate the gulf between male and female athletes. For example Martina Navratalova is without doubt the greatest female tennis player of all time and she openly admitted that she could only beat men ranked 200th (or lower). 




 There have been huge changes at the Telegraph over the last 6 months or so. All sorts of important staff leaving (or being forced out) and reorganisations etc. This has been covered on and off in the Guido Fawkes blog.

The men's section is great (and actually quite a new development) but other than that it's a pretty awful paper now.

I guess their strategy is to chase readers by trying to move toward the center (as occurs with politics) and to try to seem relevant by going along with the mainstream and abandoning any of their values or principles. 




 If it's based on merit then there wouldn't be a single female in it (or there might be just one on the bench if the worst nation there had a severe injury crisis, a small population and the very best female player in history).

I'd certainly support merging more male and male competition, though it would first make sense to do so in events where there's less difference in ability (e.g. shooting) or at least non contact sports such as athletics, swimming etc. 




 Channel 4 doesn't even try to hide it's bias these days. It's such a shame what they've become, used to be a really interesting channel back in the day. 









 Mike is actually only anti-radical feminism. He's ok with the feminism of say 1960. His argument is that for the last 40+ years the only type of feminism of any consequence has been radical feminism, hence it's ok/necessay to label himself as anti-feminist at the present time. 




 Mike is very much improving in his media appearances, this was from back in August and he does seem more focused on men in his 2015 appearances.

It certinaly woudl be great if people gave feedback, not just on Mike's debating, but perhaps more importantly on the manifesto itself. 




 Mike seems to be better at handling these debates by the day. Really enjoyed this one, some real passion from him and made some excellent points. 









 Don't see a men's rights angle here other than the daughter getting twice the compensation of the son.

Would be a men's rights issue had she not been jailed, so in this instance it's nice to see a woman actually getting an appropriate sentence for once. 




 The problem is that suicide isn't something that happens in isolation to the rest of a man's life. If we actually sorted out the horrific injustices and human rights violations caused by the family courts, divorce settlements,  false rape accusations, and dealt with crimes such as male genital mutilation and domestic abuse of men then we'd probably eliminate half of male suicides overnight. 














 Dreadful article, but well worth seeing the comments. 














 Try this: https://web.archive.org/web/20131218171247/http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-march-2007/16/read-the-small-print-before-the-next-comic-relief 




 She was bad at times, but some of her questioning was actually rather better than what Mike usually deals with. For example, her question contrasting the preference theory with the J4M B shared parenting one was almost worth asking and there was slightly more intelligence in her through process there than your typical feminist.

Many of the articles or discussion about J4M B are basically pure abuse, derailing or complete lies about the manifesto. She at least did none of these very much other than at the very beginning. 




 Charity in question is "Paws for kids" which is highlighted in the 4th paragraph 









 http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-march-2007/16/read-the-small-print-before-the-next-comic-reliefl

Two weeks ago, in these pages, Rod Liddle memorably attacked what he called the fascistic smugfest of Red Nose Day, deploring the way in which we obediently shower money on charity just because were told to by people on the telly. Rods piece made me wonder where this 40 million actually goes. The answer, besides the charities mentioned above, seems to be a remarkable number of organisations advocating womens rights. There was the Womens Aid Foundation, which was given 112,447 for its campaign against domestic violence. Bassetlaw Womens Aid separately received 66,174 for the battered women of Bassetlaw. The Family Welfare Association received 114,501 for its domestic abuse service in Leicester  which, contrary to its name, doesnt offer a service beating up members of your family on your behalf, but helps the beaten-up. There was 43,000 for Womens Integrated Services, Harrow; 65,726 for the Migrant Womens Network; **and even 77,236 for Paws for Kids, which takes in animals when abused families enter refuges  in other words, it keeps battered womens bunnies in fresh carrots.**

 It is a similar story with the 60 per cent of Comic Relief funds which are spent in Africa. There was 797,310 which went to the African Womens Support Group, 500,000 to the International Community of Women Living with HIV/Aids, 120,000 which went to the Womens Development Agency in Ghana, 25,000 for the Inter-African Womens Development Organisation, and so it goes on. Even the neutrally named charities on Red Nose Days list turn out to be involved rather more heavily on the female side: Childhope UK, which received 857,314, turns out to be spending most of the money on the street girls of Bangladesh. If Red Nose Day can be summed up in one sentence, it is: shave your nipples and save a fallen woman.

I am sure many of these charities do a jolly good job, and I wouldnt wish to make light of domestic violence, but it does rather beg the question: **why do all these womens charities, which you never see rattling collecting tins or placing adverts in the national press, feel the need to disguise their fundraising in the pratfest that is Comic Relief rather than appealing directly to the public? Are they worried that if the British public realised where their money was going they would be less inclined to be so generous?** 
























 The white Ribbon campaign sis actually far more discriminatory than even this guy suggests. Not only do they hate male victims, their only interest is the extremely narrow field of "men's violence against women".

Obviously that rules out male victims (both heterosexual and homosexual), but they're also marginalising any lesbian victims of dv, not to mention children. What makes this particularly bad is that many studies find lesbian relationships to be more violent than any other and we all know of the many children murdered by their mothers, fathers, step parents and mother's boyfriends. 




 Worth remembering that the BBC have used the public's money to employ this extremist feminist as a presenter. 



















 I posted the ITV link previously but it seems to only work for UK viewers. This video is on youtube so will work for everyone. 









 and why the party exists! 




 What s now the UK's third biggest party started off as a single issue party, with just as narrow as focus as J4M B if not more so. Not only has UKIP enjoyed massive success, it has also forced issue to be debated and forced other parties to come up with competing policies in their areas of concern.

In even forcing a discussion of the harm caused by feminism J4M B is already achieving something that has largely been completely impossible in the mainstream media. 




 Well the context we have is a court system that completely marginalises fathers teh vast majority of the time.  Thing may be as you describe, but the odds are very strongly against that possibility. 




 Well it will be on youtube before too long, Mike puts all his stuff on there eventually. Here's an alternative link, though it also requires a postcode.

http://www.itv.com/thismorning/hot-topics/britains-most-controversial-politician
One workaround may be to ensure that your browser isn't sharing your location with the site. 




 Mike was on national tv today, on a show with with at least a million viewers. 




 I had to enter a postcode to watch the video. Seeing as it is hosted on a Scotland based site then any Scottish postcode should work, I chose "G2 4PP"

For the benefit of viewers from overseas, appearing on this programme is a big deal. It's probably the UK's most popular breakfast tv show and both the presenters are very high profile. **There will have been at least a million people watching.**

Update, done a little searching and seems he's also been on LBC (London's biggest radio station) and also Notts TV. I expect a BBC appearance is going to be pretty inevitable too. 









 Certainly more per hour.

 Thanks, though as expected it's tiny and hidden away. Still better than most of the UK media though I suppose. 









 I'm aware of a one second glimpse on Newsnight. Can't find a single example anywhere on their websites either nor on any news bulletin. "Many times" really has to be a serious exaggeration. 









 **Update, just read up on the law, basically all donations under 500 can come from anywhere. Only amounts of 500 and above are actually classed as donations under UK electoral law:**

  We should all support him.

Not to mention the other gentlemen standing as J4M B candidates. Ray Barry in particular is a brilliant speaker and hugely compassionate individual. 




 Jo Swinson 




 He hates feminism, not women. 




 I think he slightly overdoes the controversy at times, but 95% of it is actually very useful and pretty genuine. 









 Yes it was pretty much impossible for a lot of young men to afford car insurance in the UK. The EU ruling means that's no longer the case. Insurance is still often very expensive for young and inexperienced drivers, but at least the additional huge surcharge for being male has gone). Our "equalities" minister opposes this change and wants to make driving for young men completely unaffordable again (which effectively forces quite a few to break the law by driving uninsured). 




 Seems that the victims wouldn't testify, something quite common in domestic violence cases. Not really the judge's fault if witnesses are too scared to appear in court. 




 In case people are wondering, the vile misandrist feminist is Green Party politician Beatrix Campbell:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrix_Campbell 




 This is the same "Equalities" minister who only favours equality when it benefits women. For example, when the EU ruled that car insurance premiums should be based on the merits of the driver, and that punishing men for being male was sexist , then she openly opposed the ruling!

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/9764984/Womens-very-unfair-Christmas-present-car-insurance-price-hike.html 









 I generally regard the BBC as biased cowards, though to give them credit they did at least show the cover on Newsnight. I can only guess that these cartoons are slightly more palatable to the Guardian/BBC management due to the the fact that Charlie Hedbo is left-wing. Still, a much welcome move and nice to see these two to actually be acting in a commendable fashion on this topic for a change. However, there's still no image on the BBC website.

A quick Google search shows quite a few US outlets publishing the image, such as CBS, Yahoo, Business insider and ABC.

The Telegraph only has the text, which is better than nothing and certainly preferable to both the Mail and independent who have nothing whatsoever. 




 Some pretty nasty feminist "academics" work at Warwick (or at least did a few years back when I read about them) and some of Harman's kids went there (and got special treatment). Therefore it's particularly surprising for this paper to come from an academic at Warwick. 














 The problem is that they make these same standards ridiculously low in order to try to accommodate female officers. 5.4 on a bleep test isn't really any sort of real fitness test. It's just a race to the bottom really.

Furthermore, in some ways such a test probably favours smaller and unfit females who can repeatedly change direction more easily than large muscular men who might also be carrying a few pounds. 




 Another way of looking at the figures is that rougly 1 out of every 12 females was unfit for duty compared with 1 male out of every 83. 









 Try this youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOvTgi2bRgY 




 Complete nonsense, there are a great many political organisations out there and misandrist groups who are classed as charities but clearly do more harm than good  (or at least do enough harm to cancel out the good). 









 The best argument against such disproportionate funding is the introduction of the HPV vaccine. That's going to make it an much less significant health concern in a few years time. Funding of research should look at medium or long term projections, so it's likely to be particularly wasteful to throw so much into research of something that is now largely being vaccinated against. 














 The feminist behind the "Freedom Programme" is Pat Craven, she appears extensively in this clip I'd saved from 2009.

From the video description:

"A good deal of exposure - far too much - was given to Pat Craven of 'The Freedom Programme', whose contribution echoed her organisation's website http://freedomprogramme.co.uk in portraying a parallel universe in which victims can be assumed to be women, perpetrators can be assumed to be men. In common with many women running organisations focused on female victims of DV, she showed not an ounce of compassion for male victims, not recognition of female perpetrators. These women are so driven by visceral hatred towards men as a class that they can't even bring themselves to PRETEND to care about male victims.

Ray Barry is the leader of Real Fathers for Justice, and will be standing for J4MB in Broxtowe at the coming general election. His media performances are always impressive - whether on television or radio - and this is a particularly good example. His contributions start at 5:23 and 15:42. In the first contribution he presents data from the British Crime Survey, showing the consistent figure of 40% of victims of DV being men, which Pat Craven blithely says she doesn't agree with (!) then changes the subject by turning to Cristina Odone." 



















 How about not linking to this trash in future please? 
























 A far more pressing issue in education is the inability to recruit male teachers, particularly in primary schools. I wonder if he also supports discriminating against female staff too? (and would be willing to state as such). 














 Can highly recommend the order-order blog for the most part. Non UK readers might not be aware that the blog rivals newspapers in terms of the traffic it receives. Also it is considered essential reading for every politician so it's great to see feminist hypocrisy exposed to huge a large audience. 









  Firstly, he discounts the fact that some women aren't permitted to use mixed gender spaces due to religious and cultural restrictions

Those same restriction also apply to men of that religion though, and no religion has vastly more females than males.

 Secondly, he assumes that a gym membership fee somehow equates to a fixed number of hours of usage of the gym.

it's not hours of usage, it's about access. If the council were truly taking gender issues into consideration they'd see that men die earlier than women and thus exercise is crucial in combating this disparity. They'd also know that men work longer hours than women and commute longer distances and therefore have the most severe restrictions on when they are able to go to the gym. If the gym are then making this problem even worse for so many men, then it's discrimination twice over.

 If he's not going to sue for his right to use the kiddie pool 

Actually some pools have banned fathers with children from kiddie pools in the past but not mothers. I'd hope they get sued too. 




 I remember seeing the woman behind this "Freedom Programme" about 5 years ago on the BBC. She was completely obnoxious, in denial about male victims of abuse. It wasn't an interview they were doing, just a debate, yet she plugged her stupid business at every opportunity as if it were a cure for cancer. I'll see if I can find a clip. 



















 He was banned for expressing concerns about his son's education. Schools are notoriously anti-male and it's noteworthy that they'd illegally ban him from the school rather than actually address his concerns. His concerns pertained to a child with a particular condition heavily associated with being male too, so that's a third possible level of relevancy.

Hard to tell exactly how much of an men's rights issue it really is without more detail though. 




 You forgot the link. 







































 She has already been forced to withdraw two different posters by the ASA. Pretty scandalous that Northumbria police are lying to everyone and using taxpayer money to spread these lies. 




 I can't link directly to the news article because Reddit doesn't allow Express links. 














 Good point, but you can still remain anonymous in the offline world to some extent, and it's often a good idea to guard your privacy anyhow.

Posters can be put up at night, PO boxes can be used and pen names or pseudonyms aren't going to casue any issues in most circumstances.

Alternatively, just ensure you are always recording your activities and then your safety will also be much increased. 




 Baird is a really nasty piece of work, it's great to see so many people working hard to hold her to account and expose her lies and misandry.

it's notoriously hard to get the UK Advertising Standards Authority to make sensible decisions when it comes to men's issues, so to have multiple successes is really impressive indeed. 




 The issue is to get "out there" more, even if online. For example there's 1,000 other subreddits out there, the majority of which are run by decent people or at least have users who favour genuine gender equality. 




 I think the point Mike is making is that one can waste an awful lot of time engaging with feminist idiots and the same goes for talking in echo chambers. Ultimately we need to be more focused on achieving more concrete goals and while I don't agree with all of his points there are some incredibly valuable tips there. Online activism is just as relevant as other types, but it's also true that it can at times be pointless - for example if hardly anyone is reading a blog or a post.

Our message and arguments are becoming much more widely understood and accepted online these days, so it's now more important than ever to move into more traditional mediums too. 




 This is one of the best articles on the J4M B site IMO. I think we all need to spend more time on effective activism and less time being diverted and having the message controlled by feminists. 




 Non-Guardian link: http://www.9news.com.au/national/2014/12/30/13/38/queensland-woman-arrested-over-end-of-month-murder-and-alleged-murder-of-four-children 




 Actually men are faster at distances such as you mention (the Channel is "only" 20 miles or so). Women only start to outperform men at ultra long distances, more likes 50 miles plus.

Ultimately there isn't so much difference in swimming ability and the key issue is survival. Women have the advantage here, and it has nothing to do with being able to float. What kills people in the sea (particularly this time of year), is the cold. Women's extra body fat gives them quite a significant advantage. Some communities in Japan have use female divers for exactly this reason. 




 You seem to assume that all Labour critics are fans of the Tories and vice-versa. While I'd certainty vote for the later over the former, I still regard most of them as idiots, and I'm proud to say I've never voted for either in any election and never intend to do so in the future.

In most policy areas there really isn't much difference between Lab/Lib/Con. While the ideologies can be a little different, they all now tend to have very similar approaches to all the main issues, all favouring their friends in big business, surveillance, censorship, PFI, the EU, mass immigration etc. You write the above as if we'd expect the Tories to have a totally different approach to spending to Labour. If Labour outflanked the Tories with buying votes with unsustainable and unpaid for spending, then it's quite hard politically to oppose such madness. Anyhow, your thinking is the opposite of reality, and we should in fact expect any two (or three) parties that were so similar ins o many areas to have essentially the same/similar (stupid) spending plans.

Put simply, the fact that your opponent is equally as incompetent and stupid as yourself, is not defence for reckless actions, and the Tories certainly aren't really to blame for much as they didn't actually do the damage themselves (merely being guilty to failing to oppose Labour in doing said damage). Furthermore, the Tories wouldn't have quite the same access to the books as Labour, thus might not have quite have appreciated the scale of the problem quite as soon as Labour would be able to.

Your last paragraph is also nonsense. For example there was at least 1 Lib Demo who predicted the crash and called out labour on it. I'm not sure what UKIP's position was but I'm sure they wouldn't have supported much of anything labour did so they probably hold the high ground too or at least don't deserve condemnation. The same probably goes for the Greens, and probably also any old-school genuine Conservatives. 




 The state they left government finances in does "wreck the country" though. And not just now, but for generations to come. Even the interest we're now paying on all the debts is now enormous and it's not as if we've been left with much to show for it either and despite the recent cuts, they've barely made a dent into the problem.

Furthermore, wrecking the country is also about far more than mere money and economics, and Labour are guilty of wrecking multiple aspects of our society. 




 Some good points so far, although more suggestions for actual policy ideas or just subtle tweaks would be useful too.

I think a few people slightly misunderstand where J4M B are coming from here. From the look of things, they're not in the business of biting their tongue and glossing over uncomfortable issues. They're certainly getting noticed and the manifesto is quite impressive in its use of sources and academic studies to make a case.

I think the sort of feedback they're looking for more than anything is in relation to actual science/statistics, not to mention people suggesting solutions to issues. Therefore if you do have comments it would be wise to back them up with sources/stats, otherwise I doubt you'll change anything.

J4M B do seem fairly radical in their positions and I don't see any problem with that - for the most part that's entirely necessary at present (for example , the moderate fathers groups achieved almost thing for some 30 years until Father4Jsutice put father's rights on the map). What J4M B do need to ensure is that every single argument they make is  intellectually bomb-proof, every proposal is entirely feasible, and that the document si completely consistent and considers any possible drawbacks of the proposals. 




 Link to a recording of the actually BBC radio 4 broadcast that debunked this myth: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00k9p0t

And here's some info on the BBC's website: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/more_or_less/8051629.stm

 




 Daniel Andrews certainly is scaremongering, his stats are a complete fabrication:

https://robertwhiston.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/27/ 




 Daniel Andrews is lying. The BBC have totally debunked his "statistics" about domestic violence being the leading cause of death and injury to women under 45, it's a complete fabrication:

https://robertwhiston.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/27/ 




 Even the BBC have totally debunked that leading cause of death and injury "stat" (though only as a result of them broadcasting it first and people complaining).

https://robertwhiston.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/27/ 




 Yes that "leading cause of death and disability for women in 45" is utter nonsense, probably based on a UN report which was then based on nothing. Furthermore, i don't recall Australia even being mentioned, even in the usual lie, so they've added an extra layer of bullshit on all the existing bullshit!

Even the BBC have debunked it, here's the full info, enjoy:
https://robertwhiston.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/27/ 




 No it's fine, as I said Mike needs to link to proof. I'd only have disputed your decision had his post been more water-tight in proving the allegation. 




 Well he challenged her publicly live on BBC radio, suggesting she retract the lie and I also understand UK libel laws have undergone some reform in the last year so they're not nearly as open to abuse as before.

I suppose the page really have linked to the source that proves it to be a lie, but other than that there's surely no issue in calling someone a liar is it's clearly a factual statement (and particularly they've been informed they're lying yet still continue with said lie). 




 They're discriminating against male students despite the education system blatantly favouring females for the last 40 years, with the gender education gap in the UK at a record high.

This is just a smaller example of the problem, and Brunel univesity hands out 22,000 to certain female students now! 




 There's one Reddit account who's sole purpose is to "expose" the fact that I have a concern in men's issues. That's all he does. It's quite flattering really though also concerning that our opponents have that much time on their hands  (and nothing better to do). 




 welcome to Reddit/mensrights! 




 It's interesting to read all the different offences she's committed, goes to show just how far feminists have to go to get in trouble at Wikipedia. I suppose at least when people finally had enough they eventually did the right thing. 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_sex_discrimination_policy_controversy 




 Note, this doesn't' seem to have been updated for a few years and Virgin recently bowed to pressure and ended their use of the policy. I'm not aware of any other changes though. 




 Have you prosecuted any false accusers? 




 Will they be allowing people to choose non ethnic minority drivers too, such as in places like Rotherham?

The recent Muslim rape epidemic of 1,400 children there has led to many customers requesting white drivers, and for good reason too seeing as not only was the taxi industry was directly linked to many of the crimes, but also almost none of the rapists have been arrested and the crimes was largely ignored and covered up by the local politicians and police. 




 It's actually rather unhealthy for men to keep their legs closed together for too long because the excess heat results in a lowered sperm count.
So in other words this iseffectively a feminist campaign to damage male fertility. 




 it is satire 




 Goes to show that simply getting a few more male teachers into schools won't solve anything. If it's a misandrist environment then the only male teachers who'll want to work there will be  the very worst kind of male feminists (or clueless idiots who don't' realise hat they're getting into).

The culture of these schools needs to change fundamentally. Would a song with "girl" in the title also be condemned? 




 Wait, so the MTA are going to run a campaign about this next year? is bad enough to tolerate insane feminist ideas, but to actually join in beyond belief. 




  I don't think you'd appreciate it if this subreddit was suddenly filled with posts about FGM either.

Would have much of a problem with that and i think you've inadvertently identified the real issue here. If anyone brings up FGM in a discussion about MGM the almost unanimous response is that its completely wrong, a violation of the children's rights, should be illegal and the perpetrators prosecuted to the full extent of the law, just as with MGM.

Now if feminists could actually bring themselves to say the same thing about MGM and if they were to be as inclusive as us, then there wouldn't be so many MGM comments because their sexism and incredible double standards wouldn't have to be challenged. That is the issue at heartt of this problem. 




 Sorry but that's bullshit. Either it's ok to mutilate kids against their will or it isn't.

Victims of FGM would actually be better protected too if governments made the genital mutilation of children illegal, right now it just gives the impression that the cultures who mutilate girls are being discriminated against and that those who mutilate boys are unfairly privilged and above ethics and the law. 




 how dare men bring the issue of circumcision into a discussion about circumcision! 




 They might not realise it, but at least the readers will 




 Try telling that to the hundreds of millions of of victims of MGM 




 and it's not as if MGM is used as a punishment and to try to stop boys masturbating... 




 Still a few sensible and pro-equality comments left uncensored on the second page of the comments of teh Guardian article. Please take the time to upvote them if you're against mutilating children's genitals 




 No need to start your own group, just put a few posters up instead. 




 Vandalising property is not a "protest" and it's blatantly obvious that he's a victim of quite severe harassment, again illegal.

I see you're quite anti-Islam, but i don't see religion as relevant here. Any perfectly sane and educated libertarian, Conservative or egalitarian would support the thrust of the article, and that wouldn't mean they didn't oppose some of the deeply unpleasant aspects of Islam and condemn the many problems it causes. 




 What possible consequences can their be for writing such an article, there's nothing wrong with it? Why would the cops or university have any interest in anything that he wrote when it's all so tame?

The only hateful and intimidating comments in thsi sage were those found on his door, yet you seem 100% fine with them, yet completely against the content of the article. If you want to see him expelled then the only logical punishment for the actual perpetrators of the crime would surely be a long period of imprisonment? 




 Your post makes no sense. On one hand you argue he has the right to write the article, yet then you contradict yourself in wanting to see him expelled, therefore suggesting he isn't allowed to write it after all.

To make matters even worse, you want the victim expelled instead of the actual perpetrators of the crime! "Arguments" on this thread from U of M almuni such as yourself only go to show how his article hit the nail on the head and was clearly not only justified, but much needed.

It's also worth noting that some comments here look fairly similar to those of the perpetrators of the crimes. 




 We have university political controversies on here all the time, for example the recent attempts to ban UKIP.

If anything this is more notable, as it's an example of blatant and sexist hatred of half the population by the person running the union. 




 They usually use "J4M B" 




 No comments yet and only 3 upvotes? This is a pretty historic document, the first ever political manifesto concerning the human rights of men and boys.

It's early days , so hopefully everyone is still reading through it. Anyway, perhaps we can use this thread to highlight the best parts of the manifesto and point out any errors or omissions. 




  Who else is even talking about it?

Well no one right now because it's old news that everyone knows about, but it was huge at the time, mainly because of Milliband and Clegg both wearing the t-shirts. I'm no fan of Cameron but his refusal to wear it became a stroke of genius when the Mail broke the story about the workers  pay and conditions.

The didn't make the story up either, they actually invested in the investigation and sent journalists out there to see what was going on. If the journalists are now banned from the country then it looks like they've struck a nerve. 




 The Daily Mail broke this story, without them this huge controversy wouldn't have seen the light of day. They are effectively the go-to source for anything about this issue. 




 If it's a shitty article then please don't link to it. You're basically encouraging them and promoting their misandry. 




 It's not completely fair to blame cops and judges either, they don't operate in a vacuum, and it's those who  create the social and political environment whereby cops and judges thnk they needs too (or can) hand out pussypasses.

We should be most angry with any politicians pushing for unequal treatment and spreading feminist lies about women in prison. And we should be even more angry with feminists/female supremacists who spend their time trying to pressure politicians/police/judges into making imprisonment a male-only phenomenon and ensuring women are exempt from punishment in the justice system. 




  The average intelligence for both men and women is dead on equal

Studies either show dead on equal or very slightly higher average intelligence for men, though nothing significant. 




 Also, the degree to which men outnumber women at the high end is slightly greater to that at the low end. 




 I'd rather the govenment got around to the far more important and far cheaper task of actually fixing the rape definition in English law. In the long term that's going to be worth far more to male victims than simply fundng a handful of services. Furthermore, while some people might object to their governement handing out money to charities, almost no one can oppose them in fixing broken laws so they become fair and sensible. 




 there's also the issue of the Guardian describing the accuser as a rape victim in their previous reports. I complained to both the BBC and Guardian about their reporting but only the former backed down and corrected all their headlines and reports. Full info here:
https://hequal.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/victory-bbc-backs-down-over-dishonest-rape-victim-headline/

Many thanks for sharing this and for the excellent points above, although please try not to link to the guardian if there are alternatives available. 




 A few years back senator Anne Cools was the keynote speaker at a conference in Ottawa concerned with helping battered husbands. Feminists were in attendance in the audience and severely disrupted the event through shouting and assaulting attendees. There are numerous videos on YouTube of what occurred, here's one of the most viewed:
https://youtube.com/watch?v=qodygTkTUYM 
























 Really have to say thanks for alerting me to the Facebook posts. They're a real gold-mine of extremism, insanity and hypocrisy. 




 "I'm far far less likely to be a victim of rape"

Yet far, far more likely to be a victim of violence overall and far more likely to be murdered - not sure why you have to just single out one particular type of serious and ignore everything else (including more serious crimes)

and I will, on average, earn more throughout my life

On the condition that you work longer hours, commute much further, work harder, work at night, in more dangerous and less popular fields. 97% of the victims of workplace deaths are male.
 




 Actually I've managed to find the Facebook post in question, funnily enough you've misrepresented the content and furthermore its by a guy who's Facebook main profile picture clearly endorses "ultra violence".

So who are we to favour and trust here, a group campaigning for human rights and against violence, genital mutilation and abuse, or for someone who openly supports violence (and then who's buddies then practice it). 




 That's highly unlikely given the mild mannered personalities of most of the candidates. Ray Barry was there for one thing, and he's about the nicest guy you could wish to meet. Any chance you could share the Facebook link so we can see the allegations?

As for justice, you need it from the government for a start. There are a least 20 areas of law and government activity that discriminate against men and boys. 




 In all fairness, they were pretty quick in starting the recording. 
























 Would be interesting to find out who was responsible. 




 Hopefully someone can identify the perpetrator. 


































 There is sometimes violence and intimidation from the far left, though most of the time it's nothing the police wouldn't be able to handle if they actually did their jobs rather than standing by and letting it happen. By failing to tackle the problem the police have in effect encouraged opponents to use violence.

I certainly haven't seen any violence by UKIP members themselves (other than maybe a guy slapping a biased journalist over the head with a piece of paper) 




 To clarify - the leader of the Green party is a woman, their sole MP is a woman (who was also their former leader and in many ways still has the role), and their representative in the House of Lords is a woman. To be fair, the was one male allowed at teh launch, though if you watch the video he's pushed off to the right so he's not sitting behind the table where the other three are.

Oh and they have a prisons policy that women basically shouldn't be locked up. 














 Partly true, though the bias on men's issues on the site is far worse than any other topic I've come across. Furthermore, it is actually possible to at least partially counter bias on other topics when you find it, whereas with men's issues there is just so much control by radical feminists that even getting outright lies removed is almost impossible. 









 What about a Labour gathering in Rotherham? 









 UKIP is the only major party in the UK to support shared parenting, so they're actually one of the most child-friendly party we have.

Furthermore, Labour, Liberals Democrats and the Conservatives have a history of child abuse scandals, with Labour in particular being heavily associated with covering up industrial scale child abuse. 















































































 Great performance by Peter, though could have brought up fathers rights sooner. 









 Don't forget to buy KC's book "until proven innocent". The following is a review: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Rosen-t.html?_r=0
 




 Actually there are multiple forms of FGM, some more severe and harmful than MGM but others less so too.

it's impossible to say which is worse without defining which specific type of FGM we're talking about. And I dare say that most victims of FGM have plenty of offspring too. 














 She's a known perpetrator of domestic violence too 














 Big increases in male unemployment in the early 80s, particularly in that area, and then a real struggle for middle-aged men to them find an alternative career. I'd guess most men don't kill themselves when losing their job, only doing so after years and years of unemployment/rejection and finally realising they're not really wanted or valued by society any more. Therefore, we'd see a big delay between the actual job losses and the suicides later resulting from them. 



















 "Oyinbo" is racist Nigerian slang for a white person. I didn't know this until reading this thread, so I doubt a single mother faking a racist attack would think it up either. Therefore this is likely to be 100% genuine. 




 Actually the use of obscure Nigerian slang makes this case seem far more legitimate than all the various scams that we've seen over the years. So unless the victim has spent time in Nigeria then I'd believe this particular case to be genuine. 





























 Great performance form Mike there, particularly in the last few minutes.

Was also good to see a host actually challenge a feminist and ask hard questions, thus resulting in her arguments completely falling apart. 




 there's some very strange going on with regards to this case and all the related incidents.

I feel this is a timely reminder for all men's human rights activists to be on their guard at all times, record all interactions wit feminists and the authorities and also strongly consider installing CCTV and perhaps a dash cam too. 









 Are you sure? The only similar item posted recently is Mike's Radio Five live interview, a completely different station.

Maybe someone linked to the BBC Leicester website previously that  missed, though that content will expire anyhow, so this is likely to be the better version in the long term. 




 Genital mutilation is the most obvious sexist application of law. All western countries completely protect a baby girl's genitals from even a pin-prick, whereas not a single one offers any protection to the most sensitive and intimate part of a male child. Worse still, some countries (or at least parts of them) then go on to take money from taxypayers and then use it to fund the genital mutilation of these innocent children. 




 What a vile presenter. Note how she can't even manage a 7 minute interview without resorting to shaming tactics. 









 Seems to be somehow connected to the university/students perhaps? 


































  In any case, what I was talking about was the increase in suicides in recent years - to which societal attitudes to men in the above cases haven't changed (that I've noticed) 

That's absolutely correct. However, there are far more divorces than 20 years ago, unfair divorce settlements are more common and the male prison population is at/near a record high too.

So, although the average man facing these problems probably has it only slightly worse than in the past, what compounds the problem there are simply far more men in these desperate and unfair situations, thus more suicides.

As for your points about the availability of government funding, that's total nonsense. The government spends hundreds of millions of pounds helping victims of abuse, it's just that almost none of it goes to the 40% of victims that are male.

I managed to number crunch the figures for spending on Scotland a few years back and break it down by gender. Basically, for every 3,500 spent on female victims of domestic abuse they spent 1 helping males.

I also detest your "prior caregiving" caveat above. Men should get to see their kids regardless of what happened in the past. If they're incapable of caregiving then fair enough, forget it, but otherwise they should have have as much of a chance of a relationship with the kids as the mother. Why should men who are/were primary breadwinners be punished for working so hard in the past and essentially become slaves forced into working for someone they no longer love? 




 I've heard this argument a lot and I'm somewhat sceptical about it. It probably causes a small number of suicides but the fact is that a lot of these men really are in a terrible position, and it's not mental health services that will fix this, they're just papering over the cracks of the real problems the men face.

We see a lot of suicidal fathers who've been denied access to their kids for no good reason for years. Others also lose their homes in outrageous divorce settlements and in fact losing the house often goes hand in hand with losing the right/ability to see their children.

There are also a great many men suffering domestic abuse and trapped in abusive relationships (often just to protect the kids), and the amount of support for such men is beyond scandalous and they're still often barely recognised at all.

Add in other wider issues such as unemployment not to mention a justice system that blatantly discriminates on the grounds of gender and it's obvious that many of these men really do want to kill themselves, understandably so if they've lost everything, and have nothing left to live for.

To stop so many men committing suicide we need things such as introducing shared parenting, support for male victims of abuse, not to mention a gender-blind justice system. Poor mental health and depression in many men is merely a symptom of the problems men face in our society. 














 I should also add how offensive it is to label this book as garbage. It's widely accepted as the best book on this issue, documenting the horrific persecution of innocent young men by corrupt prosecutors and racist/sexist academics.

In addition to the false allegations, the men faced violence, harassment, mobs surrounding their houses calling for their castration and corrupt teachers artificially lowering their grades so they failed classes. The men were of course totally innocent, and a court went as far as declaring as such - a highly unusual outcome.

The vile false accuer in the case who all these "academics" supported wholeheartedly suffered no consequences as a result of her actions. As a result she was free to continue her life on exactly  the same path, resulting in her murdering her boyfriend.

I really suggest you read the book, i's such an important work about a hugely important case. 









 Complete nonsense in so many ways. For one thing, you'll find that the author of the book is KC Johnson, a Democrat who supported Obama:

 Can I at least link to Amazon in the comments so people can navigate to the best price? 




 Can't recommend this book highly enough, and seeing as feminists have been trying to silence the author this week I thought I'd remind people of his best work.

Hopefully this will backfire and he'll get even more sales as a result.

Tip: if you want a bargain, then click on other sellers of the hard cover version on Amazon. It can currently can be had for $10.28, fulfilled by Amazon: 









 Well you can see there's no commission id thingy in the post - it's a very simple url. Anyway, I guess I'll find a review, but it really is easy to tell if anyone is getting paid or not.

 KC Johnson is a quite brilliant man. He blogged about the Duke Lacrosse case for the best part of a decade!, and he's the foremost expert on the case by far. On top of all that, he seems like a genuinely nice guy too.

If you haven't read it yet, get yourself a copy of his book right now. I considered it essential reading for anyone interested in men's human rights.

 I wonder if any Labour party members in Rotherham will have their kids taken away from them? I'd certainly trust this guy with a child far more than that lot. 









 I wonder if they'd also take kids away from Labour Party members in Rotherham?

 I missed that, well spotted. The article is even better than I thought. I've already thanked the journalist via twitter, I suggest other express their tanks, either via Tweets or using the comments. 














 Some highlights from the article:



 Student Chris Warwick, 32, of Goldenhill, Stoke-on-Trent, said: If women have a network or society, and so do the LGBT+ community, it is only fair a Mens Rights Society should be allowed.

 And yet the mere mention of the creation of one brings about discussion into whether it should be allowed!

 The Womans Network allegedly finds the creation of the society dangerous. Anyone supporting true equality between sexes wouldnt find this dangerous at all, and so one has to come to the conclusion are they really supporting gender equality? 









 Actually, Mike's quite an accomplished author, he has quite a few books on Amazon. Furthermore, this is one of his more recent works, and therefore an improvement on some of his previous writings.

* 3 on Amazon.ca  http://www.amazon.ca/Feminism-Ugly-Truth-Mike-Buchanan-ebook/dp/B00795BPEO/ 



















 Pretty unbalanced piece. it highlights all the very rare cases of feminists being silenced, ignoring routine silencing of others.

Where were the condemnations of the goings on in Canada, or closer to home, the treatment of UKIP, Israeli academics etc 




 and the purpose of MGM is to try to stop masturbation / pleasure 



















  The procedures performed in female genital mutilation - even class 4 - have no medical benefits whatsoever. None.

Well for one thing the tissue cannot become cancerous if it is removed so there's a "benefit" (if we hacked off the breast tissue from girls in the same we we butcher boys penises we'd almost completely eliminate breast cancer too).

Anyway, multiple academic studies show a reduction in HIV infections for women who've undergone FGM, so you're talking complete nonsense. Here's two, both from different countries:
http://www.tzonline.org/pdf/femalecircumcisionandhivinfectionintanzania.pdf
http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113 context=iph_theses

other scientific studies show reductions in HPV infections


(And note, in case it isn't' clear, I find all forms of genital mutilation completely barbaric, regardless of the gender of the victim). 




  I would like to see both seen as equally bad.

Well some forms of FGM do clearly cause significantly more harm than MGM so it's not exactly fair to say all cases are equally bad. On the other hand, less severe forms of FGM are actually less harmful than MGM. Therefore FGM is both more and less harmful than MGM, it all depend on which particular type we're talking about. 




 Further study from Kenya shows the same thing:

http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113 context=iph_theses

Probably a good idea to add these to that spreadsheet of essential MRA studies? 









 That's great, the same should apply to MGM. 




   I feel the need to point out that female genial mutilation is in no way, shape or form equivalent to male circumcision in a medical or anatomical way.

Utter nonsense. It's true that the most extreme forms of FGM are significantly more harmful than MGM, but on the other hand, many forms of FGM are entirely comparable with MGM as are all the supposed "benefits". In fact women produce far more smegma than men (10 times more) so in many ways it's 10 times more beneficial (assuming butchering kids genitals is your thing).

Here's the recent comments by a senior UK judge noting that MGM can be more harmful than FGM:
http://www.inside-man.co.uk/2015/01/15/male-circumcision-can-be-worse-than-fgm-rules-senior-judge/ 




 Yes but FGM is also a "private decision" using your logic above. And many forms of FGM are no more monstrous than MGM (and sometimes less so as noted recently by a UK judge). 




 Presumably you feel exactly the same way about FGM? (and FYI all the supposed "benefits" of MGM apply equally to many forms of FGM). 




 They do at least employ Neil Lyndon, so that puts them ahead of 95% of outlets in itself. 




 Thanks. The only reason I linked to the article was because it was only 90% nonsense and becasue it allows comments (and voting on those comments). 



















 MGM is actually funded by the taxpayer in some parts of the UK and carried out in taxpayer funded facilites. 


































 In the UK at least (where the video is from) there just isn't a major issue with huge percentages of male officers not being able to do the job.

The stats for the London police fitness tests were recently released. obviously the standards are  low, but only 1.2% of male officers failed and so it shows that they at least somewhat fit for duty. On the other hand, 8% of female officers failed the test, a quite extraordinary difference. 




 The problem is that by constantly lowering standards for the benefit of women then you're also helping those fat cops.

Furthermore, if these women barely pass the much lower standards when they're new recruits, the just image how useless they're going to be when fat and out of shape. An overweight but quite muscular and tall man is going to be a lot more use in detaining criminals than an equally out of shape female half his size. 




 It's legal if there's a similar session that bans women. 




 She was living in Rotherham from 2008, so that's 7 years she's had in the area. Previous to that she was in Manchester, where again grooming scandals were prominent in surrounding towns. It would be interesting to establish exactly when she first spoke out against the blatant and industrial scale of rape, abuse and exploitation of children. The fact she was also working with children also would increase my expectation of her making such a statement. 




 You don't have to be an MP to speak out against something and as a labour Party member not to mention a citizen of that area she'd be well placed to raise the issue with the previous MP.

I'd say even wanting something done 10 years ago might even be downplaying things. In neighbouring parts of the country these gangs were public knowledge more than 10 years ago, so she could have done anything at any time during more than a whole decade, instead she focuses on irrelevant distractions such as Palestine, even on the day the most damming report was published. 














 Incredible how people can twist things so much in their own mind that they completely turn reality on its head. 




 Haven't seen the film but these things need to be all about context.

The bumbling idiot male concept is fine for occasional use and can be extremely funny not to mention harmless.

The real problem arises when the concept becomes almost the norm and /or when it is accompanied by some sort of equally inaccurate genius / superhero mother which just compounds the problem.

If a company has a history of misandry or producing feminist propaganda then go ahead and boycott such a film. On the other hand, if they don't have a reputation for pushing this kind of bullshit then give them a break and focus on more important issues. 



















 At the very least we should not link to Misandrist articles where comments are disabled (or heavily censored). 




 Yes, but one with more intelligence and insight than almost anyone else one the MSM. It's rare to see someone who actually "gets it" who also has the ability to articulate his message to a large audience in an entertaining and accessible manner. Comedians have a far bigger role in society than simply making us laugh. Comedy can be perhaps the greatest form of activism of all. 




 He makes a great point about how they're empty threats in many cases and that men should sleep in their own beds. I enjoy his material and think he's an extremely funny guy.

However, he does gloss over the plight of the hundreds of thousands of men trapped in abusive relationships. Perhaps their wives can't dominate them physically in a fair 50-50 fight, but there's plenty of knives in the kitchen, not to mention the huge advantage of the surprise attacks. He also ignores that act that the man is not allowed to fight back or defend himself, so there is real danger for many men out there. Poisoning is also favoured by female abusers, which again has nothing to do with strength.

Of course if physical attacks fail then all that's required is a 30 second call to the police falsely alleging abuse and the man is in all sorts of trouble, and the sofa is a much nicer option than a police cell.

The best point to take from the video is that men should not tolerate minor abuses. Those men agreeing to sleep on the sofa are probably the ones who end up as victims of much more serious domestic abuse in future, so it's good to see people taking a stand and encouraging others to do so. 

















































 I see people have added a bunch of 5 star reviews and the book is now in the top 10 feminist theory books on Amazon.com

Excellent work everyone. 









  the party in the area is strong

Well it was strong once, but surely a lot weaker now people have seen how terrible the Green councillors in Brighton turned out to be? Their awful track record has caused a huge amount of damage to the Green Party brand there, and thus her reasons for not using it are blatantly obvious (and extremely sensible) 









 There are now over 60 fake reviews thanks to the campaign by Erin Gibson:
https://j4mb.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/erin-gibson-the-genius-orchestrating-spoiler-reviews-of-feminism-the-ugly-truth-on-amazon-com/

Doesn't seem to be the best strategy though because sales are up significantly. I guess people don't like this kind of thing. What do others think abut this tactic? (and about the book too if you've bought it) 









 The campaign backfired and all the one star reviews generated a lot more interest in the book and thus a lot more sales. While I'm sure a few feminists have bought it, the number is clearly VERY small because none of the reviews mention anything about the content of the book. Therefore most of the sales must be from other people who have been outraged by what the feminists have done and don't like to be told what they can and cannot read. 




 No it's still there, the category only shows below the book if it's in the top 20 sellers. Sales seem to have slowed a little in the last day or two, hence the category isn't showing at present. 




 Not nearly as funny as the huge boost they've given to sales. It was in the top 20 feminist theory books for quite a while following the campaign (and various other top 20s too).

The reasoning behind their spam crusade is pretty hilarious too. The following is the quote from Erin who led the campaign:

**"Lets Internet justice the guy who would like to legislate that less efforts be made to help girls into STEM careers."**

Think about that for a second, J4M B are simply suggesting the government doesn't give thousand of ponds of taxpayer money to women simply for going to university while the same money is denied to men. He's not introducing any evil legislation banning women in science, he just wants equality of opportunity, yet the feminists intentionally twist the truth.

The whole campaign is based on a lie, and that of course is typical of feminism. Perhaps an updated version of the book will outline this whole saga as yet another example of just how ugly (and stupid) feminism can be

  anti-circumcision people

I'm not anti-circumcision. It's a completely appropriate and very useful surgery for a very small number of children and men who have significant issues with their foreskin and for whom other less severe option will not work. It should just be the last resort, as with all other amputations. 




 If they are going to "educate" on the benefits then they also need to educate on the harms. It's not education if you're only telling people 10% of the story. 




 Because all the "benefits" are massively less than the huge amount of harm and damage caused by both procedures and it's complete insanity to amputate healthy and important tissue, particularly in that area of the body. 




 Well how about we educate teenage girls about the "benefits" of fgm? Pretty much all "benefits" of MGM apply to the more moderate forms of FGM. And the "benefits" of removing breast tissue from teenage girls would be greater still. 









 What the hell is going on? 














 Half of the MPs from his party are projected to lose their seats at the next election (100 days from now). Lets hops he's one of them. 




 Just in case people doubt that this is a pussypass, here's the reality of the sentence. In the UK only those with long sentences tend to serve the full term. Your typical prison sentenced to 1 year will only serve around six months in prison! 









 No, feminist want equal rights for women but not equal responsibilities.

 The one term that's really worked is adding "human" to the title. Radical feminists hate to acknowledge that men are human beings, and they really couldn't stand those "men's rights are human rights" posters. 




 Mike only opposes radical feminism, though he argues that's been the only type of feminism of any significance in the west in the last 40+ years.

Also, bear in mind that there are an awful lot of inaccuracies in this article, a feature of almost all the J4M B coverage in the last fortnight. 









 Various ranks listed at the bottom of the page, the highest it charted at so far was 13th in the feminist theory section.

http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Ugly-Truth-Mike-Buchanan-ebook/dp/B00795BPEO/

For reference, it was ranked as low as around 250,000 before the feminists got involved. 









 35 fake 1-star reviews in 3 days, none of winch actually critique any of the content of the book:

Canadian feminists have only managed a couple of 1-star reviews so far. 




  Haven't the paris shootings said anything about trying to burn a book?

The organiser actually has "je suis Charlie" as her Twitter image! The lack of lack of self awareness is astonishing. 




 Exactly,

If they actually left critical reviews that pointed to possible flaws in the arguments or challenged perhaps the very worst source used then that would be great, but they just can't debate with others because they know they'll lose. 




 A quote from the feminist behind the campaign to leave all the negative reviews:

"Someone gave Mike a toothy blow job and now he hates all women. Heres a shining example of some of his work available on Amazon. Ive already written a review, sarcastically titled Good Book, Bad Fonts. **Lets Internet justice the guy who would like to legislate that less efforts be made to help girls into STEM careers.**" 
























 What the hell does retiring or standing down have to do with representing one's constituents in Parliament. Either they're people's MP or they're not. Are you saying they get to stop early becasue they're not after people's vote next time and so don't have to do their job properly? They should be supporting shared parenting becasue it's the right thing to do, not just to get votes.

I suppose you make a fair point about minister's sometimes tending not to sign, though in most cases the sexism accusations still stand for those MPs, particularly Lynne and Lorely (and increasingly so for Jo too). Lynne has a very long history of terrible sexism against men and it's a scandal she's ever been allowed near any equalities position given her obvious contempt for half the population. How often did you actually see her actually do her job and pushed for shared parenting (or for any significant equal rights for men and boys for that matter). I hear that Lorely is quite the sexist too, with Jo now also getting in on the action and actually campaigning against any progress toward equality when it doesn't benefit women: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/9764984/Womens-very-unfair-Christmas-present-car-insurance-price-hike.html 
























 All feedback is appreciated, I'll fix the article so it suits a more global audience. 









 the second paragraph uses the full terminology for "EDM" 




 Bit of a shame really, I expected the Lib Dem women would be more in support of equality than the likes of Labour. 




 Actually it's not all that dumb becasue many other issues elsewhere also see significant rises, for example the number of road deaths in countries such as India is staggering, thus easily dwarfing murder of women.

Any articles debunking lies (and UN lies at that) has to be extremely welcome 














 Thanks for this, i think I may well add it to the article as an explanation for the results. 









 Are there any Firefox or Chrome plug-ins to block Gawker sites? 









 Most are/were complete cunts though and that's the criteria we're looking for here. 




  This is an issue that disproportionately affects men, so it is unsurprising to me that it would attract proportionally more male signatories.

Except we're told that the reason we need female MPs is that they'll all be far less macho, and instead of focusing on big engineering schemes and the military, they'll push for equality and for breaking down gender roles. Thus, were the female MPs to act as we were todl they would, then their support for shared parenting woudl be significantly igher than the support from men.

Furthermore, this is not simply a men's issue. Child are damaged hugely by a lack of relationship with their fathers (both boys and girls), and wrongly exclusing the father from a child's life almost always goes in hand with excluding grandparents, uncles and aunts etc

Anyway, thanks for checking the stats, there seems to have been a rounding error and so 12 looks to be the correct figure. (BTW  60% represents how many extra female MPs would have been needed were the number of male supporters adjusted downwards - i.e. if the 104 figure was fixed) 




 Update, I tweeted some of the various female MPs who failed to sign the EDM and one actually replied! No indication of her changing her mind though unfortunately.

 Exactly. The Lib Dems weren't responsible for Rotherham (nor countless other similar cases) 




 TBH I haven't seen too many sex offenders in UKIP at all. Similarly I've never seen them hanging around with terrorists or planting bombs. Corruption seems to be something of a recurring issue in UKIP to at least the same extent as in Labour.

Ultimately, I think it's fair to say that the types of undesirables seems fairly different between parties. 




 Looks there's actually one Labour MP I'd consider voting for after-all. 














 At HEqual we ran a pretty successful campaign last year against the Boys are Stupid products.

In the end we got more than half of retailers to withdraw the products and most of the biggest UK book distributors also cased stocking the merchandise. Perhaps it's time for phase two now? 




 Danczuk seems to have more common sense and be of more use than all the other Labour MPs combined.

Thanks. 









 A really sickening practice, it's a shame politicians don't dare stand up to this abuse of children. 



















   the fact of the matter is that vast majority of domestic violence is male to female

Utter nonsense, literally hundreds to studies show gender symmetry in terms of perpetration of domestic violence. Yes a lot more males abusers are found in police statistics, but that's simply due to the failure to seek out, report and arrest females perpetrators. When you actually look at more reliable indicators such as crime surveys you find huge numbers of male victims and female perpetrators.

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.5578 rep=rep1 type=pdf

To further emphasise just how false your remark is, just think about all differnet types of domestic violence out there that we ignore. For example there's domestic violence against children, a notable aspect of which is the tendency of mothers to abuse boys much more than girls. also think about homosexual relationship, which many studies note are the most violent of any type. The idea that domestic violence is almost always men abusing women is quite simply a lie. 




 Thanks, a slight correction: I've now found an article that describes it as "domestic violence" but only in the context that it "isn't the first domestic violence incident between the former couple". There is still no source that outright describes this particular incident as domestic violence in itself.
 




 I couldn't find a single article about this issue that used the term "domestic violence" to describe these crimes. Amazing how the media changes it's terminology when it's the male that's the victim, or the female that's the perpetrator. 




 Fantastic video, it's interesting to hear knowledgeable campaigners speak in depth on men's issues. 





























 There are other mirrors of some of the videos 


































 Note the BBC's bias here (and the media generally)

What we have is a set of laws that refuses to protect innocent male babies from dangerous, non-consesnual and irreversible mutilation, with such barbaric practices even funded and supported by the taxpaer! On the other hand, the same laws are  over-protective of females to such an extent that the laws becomes concerned with mere piercings on consenting adults.

It's obvious that males are subject to extreme discrimination by the government, yet the BBC has to pretend it's females are the victims despite the reverse obviously being the case. 



















 Here's the info on the three constituencies and candidates (they are all in the Nottingham area):

 Actually that's not true at all, you can help out from afar in all sorts of ways.

For a start you can share J4M B links and videos, follow them on Twitter and retweet them. Comments on articles about J4M B help too.

Donations from abroad are also permitted just as long as they're not thousands and thousands of pounds.

Feedback is good too, for example you can suggest improvements and submit better academic sources for any weaker parts of the Manifesto.

They don't' even have a Wikipedia article yet either so perhaps someone could help with that also. 




 They aren't seeking to ban abortion, just to change the present limit on the time frame at which abortions are not longer allowed. The main purpose of this seems to be to ensure no viable foetus is ever aborted 



































































































 Here's the second video with the screaming and ranting:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfyekgkpB5I 
























 Anyone know what happened to the false accuser? 














 It's not about me - the point is that a lot of people on Reddit use iPhones etc and therefore won't be very likely to block ads.  This proves we need to avoid linking to sites making money out of misandry and instead need to use archive links. 




 As far as i'm aware it's not link spamming - the problem seems to a lack of IT skills by J4M B staff combined with the total absence of any spare time in the run up to the election. I have passed on comments to Mike and he's promised to get round to fixing it after the election

Anyway i will make a text post soon after getting some more specific details of when people are needed. 




 There's not much on ios 




 J4M B are standing in three constituencies in the Nottingham area. It would be great if these guys could get a semi respectable number of votes and in some cases at least defeat other smaller parties. Details of the constituencies they are contesting and the rival parties are here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broxtowe_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29#Elections_in_the_2010s
 














 That's not completely true, for example it's harder to enable adblock on phones and tablets etc, and therefore people might only use it on their computer. 









 Not really fair to insist on highlighting such as chasm, afterall MGM is funded by the taxpayer, so just putting a stop to that waste of money and making the abusers fund the mutilations themsleves would be a start. 









 Actually, I think the filter pre-dates the SPLC nonsense 




 Well 95% of blocked sites were identified through my research, I identified which technology was behind the blocking, and which companies use it. 




 Some more articles I've written on this topic:

http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/06/an-email-to-the-symantec-board.html

http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/06/o2-and-symantec-equality-for-men-is-more-hateful-than-stormfront.html

http://www.avoiceformen.com/misandry/symantec-o2-still-censoringdefaming-mhra-sites/

http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/07/now-fathers4justice-are-censored-and-defamed-by-o2-and-symantec.html


 




 I'm not familiar with Symantec's politics, although I found one person involved to be a feminist (though she was only responsible for defending the sexism and not in charge of the actual filter technology).

It does occasionally block really extreme feminist sites, though generally it does seem that the "hate" classification gets triggered by  the transphobic content on those sites and it generally doesn't appear to be programmed to block  sites containing hate speech directed at men. 




 Would be nice if those rules in the textbook applied to the domestic violence industry in terms of how they refer to victims/perpetrators. 




 I saw that censorship of men's human rights sites was a hot topic right now so best re-post some of my investigative work into the matter. I wrote this article over two years ago but it's all still 100% accurate today becasue nothing has changed, 

I'm probably the foremost expert on the censoring of men's human rights sites by web filters and I've written 5 or 6 articles investigating exactly what's going on and which companies use the filters.

I'll share more of those articles later or others are free to post them. If anyone has any questions on this issue I'll be able to answer most of them fairly easily and accurately.

Some further reading of my research into the matter:

 Hi, I've written more about the blocking of men's human rights sites than probably anyone else out there.

There are actually quite a few school who use the Symantec filtering system. It blocks men's human rights sites as "hate sites" so your school is probably better than a lot of others and at least only censoring instead of also defaming organisations. 

















































 Except the court wishes to see the child's undergo sexual assault and irreversible mutilation, all completely against his will. It's even willing to jail those seeking to protect the innocent child. It' surely advisable to stay well away from institution that uses such threats and supports violence and sex abuse? 




 I disagree. If the father wants to mutilate his kid than that's one thing, the truly abhorrent part here is the court trying to force this mutilation upon the child.

There are plenty of crazy and messed up people out there who want to do evil things to kids, we can't change that to any great extent, but we surely can at least stop the government joining in and taking their side. 



















 Thanks for making this a sticky! 
























 Meanwhile companies such as Symantec block men's human rights sites every single day. A few examples of what they consider to be "hate" sites:

* http://www.dvmen.co.uk
* http://dvmen.org
* http://falserapesociety.blogspot.com 



















 Note that the article actually uses the term "paternity fraud". That's real progress and almost certainly down to the work of our movement and our insistence on using accuracy terminology to describe such a crime. 














  I prefer it. If you aren't and prefer it, good. It's not yours or my business what others do.

In this case the boys clearly doesn't' prefer it, yet this mutilation is being forced upon him by the state against his will and against the will of his mother. Such an outrage is everyone's business and courts shouldn't be ordering the mutilation of kids.

 




 So she went form supporting child abuse to opposing it. Surely people who read the evidence and change their minds after learning the facts and ethics about an issue should be commended for doing the right thing instead of put in prison?

Even ignoring all he above, at the end of the day the child has stated he doesn't' want to be mutilated. It' his penis and if he doesn't' want people chopping bits of it off then it's his choice. 




 perhaps you should be aware that America is about the only developed country to endorse such abuse and that others regard it as so harmful that they are looking at banning it.

As with all things, also be sure to follow the money to figure out how some AAP decisions come about. 




 The Bloodstained Men are a excellent and extremely long running intactivist group who campaign against male genital mutilation in America.

They're great at raising awareness and confronting those performing and endorsing MGM. They're targeting the north-east this year due to it's higher than average rates of MGM (over 70%!) so its' really important to challenge attitudes in such states in order to protect children from this form of abuse.

A few videos of them in action for those who haven't seen them yet:

* [Protest in Denver] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSsdPE4AC0g)
* [Interesting exchange in Tuscaloosa, Alabama] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-PujOfGYZ8)
* [Protest at the AAP convention in San Diego] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGPu4jB_L2g)


They're looking to raise $5K and at the time of making this post they are at $2,140, here's the donation page:

http://www.youcaring.com/nonprofits/help-fund-the-2015-northeast-bloodstained-men-tour/294627

These guys work hard and have even been wrongly arrested while protesting, so they deserve our full support.

Thanks 




 Any supposed benefits of MGM will never outweigh the risks and harm caused. It's obvious that important body parts should never be amputated unless they are diseased or damaged beyond repair.

Butchering kids genitals just for the hell of it and without their consent is sickening child sex abuse. 




 There's a big campaign to tweet about this using the hashtag #SaveChase

It also seems to be a trend to draw said hashtag on your body, and upload the photo of it.

There's also a legal fund set up to fight the case, though note that I haven't fully investigated who's running it etc and exactly how the money is being spent: http://chasesguardians.org/wp/ 



























































 Really generous of someone to spend 1,000 to donate this to J4M B. 









 Laughable article, but it's well worth reading the comments section 





























 I too was suspicious about the likelihood of a genuinely right-wing party proposing such a thing, and it's actually almost completely false to categorise this party as right-wing. It was true at one time, but according to Wikipedia they've shifted over the last decade from being right-wing towards the center:

 "Under the leadership of Jyrki Katainen, chairman from 2004 to 2014, the National Coalition Party shifted from a socially conservative, neoliberal party of the upper class towards a socially liberal, centre-right catch-all party.[8][9] It is now moderately liberal and reformist,[10] and supports, among other things, multiculturalism[11] and same sex marriage.[12"
