 No one can tell you whether or not you'll bond with your child.  You either want to, or you don't, it's that simple.  You're making it out to be some grand thing that no one has ever gone through before and is some great compromise you're making.  Stop it.  It's a new human being you're bringing to life and it's made from you. It's the greatest gift there is to give and is the only lasting contribution you'll probably ever make.  It's an investment in your own future.  If you don't want to end up a lonely old man you'll consider what things you'll want and will make you happy throughout your life.  For most people, it's the happiness that love and family bring.  If that isn't for you, let your wife find it elsewhere. 




 Regarding your title, I like going outside, it's pretty nice out there.  As far as your text goes, stop whining and do something about it if you care that much.  Complaining on the internet is not a solution.

 I'm not pontificating, I'm a grandparent who's cared for too many foster kids because of dads who didn't want to be dads.  I've far more real experience than you do, I'd bet. It's been my experience that it can go either of two ways; either he bonds with the newborn within a few days, or he does not.  If he does not, the child suffers and so does the mother since she's constantly having to make up for his lack of participation or, sometimes, abusive behaviour.  I'm sure there are some marriages that survive, but at what cost to the innocent child?  If you don't want to be called  daddy or won't step up for your own offspring, don't make someone else pay for it.

 Feelings of failure or inadequacy keep us looking back.  Why did they leave me?  Why wasn't I good enough?  What did I do wrong?  Could I have fixed it?  When in reality, it was probably nothing specific we did.  We're different people as we grow and change and aren't always suited to each other during certain phases of our lives.  There's probably something in a past relationship you miss and look to remind yourself of.  Just because we aren't with them doesn't mean the feelings disappeared.  It's ok to look back every now and then, just remember you're not who you used to be and have grown since then.

 I have two stories.  My sister once darted out into the road and was hit by a car.  I watched my dad woosh! over to it, pick that car up by himself and pull that child out.  She ended up with only a broken arm and he had a bit of trouble with his shoulder for a few days.  The other incident with her and my dad: she'd taken her aquarium into the bathtub to wash it(?) while he and I were outside throwing the ball around.  All of a sudden my mom let out a blood-curdling scream and, whoosh!, he was inside that bathroom, whipped off his belt and applied it as a tourniquet around her slashed up arm because she'd dropped it and it broke.

 We only get to be here a short time, but, we still get the opportunity to be here.  It's like a roller coaster ride, when our time is up someone else gets on the ride.  We only get to have the ones we love in our lives for an indeterminant amount of time.  Be glad we got them at all because it could have been a far different experience.  The cycle of life is as exactly as it should be. 




 I've heard people call those guys every name in the book and expect them to just volunteer to load up groceries, furniture, etc. immediately after questioning their intelligence and saying all kinds of mean things to them.

 I agree with your friend.  I don't need anyone to interpret what I should believe or not.  God has already told us how things are and I can pray anywhere, not just in a church.  I think people from every kind of church I've ever been to gave me some kind of insight, but so do relatives and coworkers and some posters on reddit.  We can gain knowledge or wisdom from anywhere if we're open to it. 




 Sure I can be a Christian, there were Christians while Jesus walked the Earth before the religion existed.  A Christian should be follower of Jesus.  I do not follow any of those specific requirements, beliefs or approaches because God didn't design them or say He condoned them.  He told us what to do and how to handle things in the Bible and that's all we need.  Not specific messages or anything that come from men. 




 God said all, I think He means all.  I don't think God hates anyone.  Jesus said He came for all men, that includes those who cursed Him.  While He was being sacrificed on the cross He even said, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do".  Can't be much clearer than that. 




 I don't think so because a Christian is simply a follower of Jesus.  They were called Christians while Jesus was still alive, before the actual religion began to take shape. 




 Religion, with it's attached requirements, celebrations, rituals, rules, certain attitudes or beliefs are all specific to the men who founded that particular religious interpretation.  They want to stand out in same way, usually as being the one true religion that has the truth and understanding of God's holy words on their side. .  That isn't what the Bible says, it says it's written for all men, not just the ones who believe like this religion or that one.  God says pray earnestly for understanding and you'll get it.  That book was written for everyone to understand, not just the "special" ones.   They all corrupt, in some way, what it clearly says. 




 Religions exist, all with their own specific requirements, beliefs. approaches and messages.  I don't support them. 




 I think mean things about people. 




 I am a Christian, I read the Bible and I believe in God, but I do not believe in religion.

 Swan, Drake, Crowe, Finch, Wrenn, Ferrett, Lyon, Fox and Byrd. 




 Apparently, they believe the poor or stupid cannot always afford an I.D.  I take issue with this because they need an I.D. to purchase, alcohol,  cigarettes, rent or buy a home, receive welfare, food stamps, social security, unemployment and medicaid, get a driver's license, go to school, buy a gun, get a job, get married, have a bank account, buy a car or a plane ticket.  They need an I.D. to rent a hotel room, get a hunting or fishing license, give blood or to even buy certain cough medicines.  Clearly the poor make good use of these programs and purchases.  No one ever raises the income or race issue on these things, but when it comes to voting they're all over it shouting discrimination.  This makes me think that that maybe the reason these liberals don't want to require an I.D. to vote could be because they could either be bringing in illegal voters, underage people and even the names of dead people.  Poor or not, they can and do get I.D.s for all these other needs and an I.D. for voting and proving legal citizenship is not an undue burden and should be required.

 A year after Amanda Berry disappeared in Cleveland, her mother appeared on "The Montel Williams Show" to speak to a psychic about what happened to her daughter.   Psychic Sylvia Browne, who has made a career of televised psychic readings, told Louwanna Miller on a 2004 episode of the show that her daughter was dead, causing Miller to break down in tears on the show's set.  "She's not alive, honey," Browne told Miller on the show.  Miller said that she believed "98 percent" in what Browne told her. Miller died a year later from heart failure. 

Amanda Berry is the women who escaped as a hostage from the home of  Ariel Castro and is very much alive. 




 Amanda Berry.  That psychic helped cause her mother's death and should be prevented legally from ever giving out this kind of bogus information.  That said, people are stupid for putting any stock in these people to begin with. 




 People who believe horoscopes are some kind of special, hidden knowledge and schedule their lives around them.  People who believe psychics are telling them the truth, especially when they conjure up dead loved ones. 




 It's my right as a human being.  There is no one who can bestow it on me and  no one has authority to remove it unless I'm in a prison of some kind. 




 And there are those who do not.  If I'm not mistaken, it refers back to when they used red-colored clay to paint themselves because it kept away the insects and was a sunscreen.  We use stereotypical names for all races.

 Judge Lind ruled that the 3 and 1/2 effective "years" Mr. Manning has already served since his 2010 arrest (a total inflated by time in solitary confinement) would count towards the 35-year sentence.  That leaves Mr. Manning with only 31 and 1/2 years left in the sentence.  If he does not win an appeal or get parole, he would be 56 years old when he gets out of federal prison.  However, in all likelihood he will get out long before then.  One possibility, albeit unlikely, is an appeal or a pardon.  Much more likely is the possibility of parole.  Mr. Manning's lawyer said that with military court parole rules, if Mr. Manning continues his good behavior as a prisoner, he could be eligible for parole in 6 and 1/2 years.  In that circumstance he could see freedom by the age of 32.  Being granted parole is by no means guaranteed, particularly in controversial high profile cases, but there's always hope and possibility.

He did expose war crimes to the public, along with leaking 300,000 classified documents.  He's a convicted felon, whether we agree with it or not.

 That depends on who you ask.  I'm not for or against the man, but I believe he's reneged on many promises and expectations he cultivated for himself to get support.  He seems to be more pro-govt. and corporations than he is pro-Americans.  He promised an open presidency and whistleblower protections, among other things, only to have gone back on these promises.

 They'll equate "separate but equal" as the stance to take to push a particular point of view. But, it isn't the same.  Anyone who lived through those times knows it isn't the same because in this instance, they'll have what they wanted legally, whereas during the civil rights movement and segregation they did not.  They do not equate since this regards nothing more than a label placed upon it.

 Lets see, we're pro-abortion, pro-gay rights, took God and morals out of schools, left drug addicted parents to raise future generations, use pedobear as a joke, legitimized unhealthy sexual practices, promote degraded sexual values (or not values at all) and consider them conquests, men leave their their babies to be raised by their mommas alone on govt. assistance because they don't want the burden, women mistreat or ignore their babies because they become nothing more than a paycheck, we've forced families to send both parents to work leaving the raising of the kids to strangers, determined the belief in God is now a mental illness and should be quashed at every opportunity, treat our parents and kids with strong depressive drugs, create unattainable personal images for young people so they grow up knowing they aren't good enough, passed all the money to corrupt people running all governments and many businesses, burdened all our people (and especially students) with taxes and fees leaving them near poverty levels, promoted the hive mind of get-in-line-and-don't-think-differently paradigm, spread our unique brand of evilness around the world and we wonder what happened while we weren't looking.  The blessing has been removed, my friend, it's gone for good.
