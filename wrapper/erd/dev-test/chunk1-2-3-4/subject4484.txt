 Whoa, so that's what [Carl's watching in Up](http://youtu.be/Fu7h2Jb7XOo).
Awesome. 




 Don't the vast majority of fish use external fertilization, though? In the scenario you described, the eggs wouldn't develop...

 [Similar](http://www.freewebs.com/calhobbes/ch920610.jpg), and equally as funny. 




 Less than 2 hours until launch, should be fun to [watch](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html). 




 [It does](http://youtu.be/anmsvr0Ziyg) 




 It's better explained in the book.
But not much better. 




 If that's the tiger fish, it ended up dying and being carried off by a bunch of kids who didn't seem to want to eat it.
Made me real sad, beautiful fish. 




 Might be by Quino... 
























 I honestly don't think it will be that much more noticeable just because it's green, it's already very noticeable when it passes and very few people have ever seen it.

If you use mirrors, it will only be visible right after dusk and before dawn, just as it is now, hardly a constant reminder.

In the case of a light beam, very few people would see it as it points at them in the night,  you'll still need to know exactly when it's going overhead.

Just my 2 cents... 




 What we see when we look up at the ISS is light reflecting over all the surfaces it has, especially the solar panels, so it can usually be seen by a large area of land. A beam of light would be visible only to the people it's pointed at, and even then only barely, compared to the rest of the light coming from it.

I think you would see better results just by getting the message out on how to spot it. My mind was pretty thoroughly blown the first time I saw it, now I show it to people every chance I get. 

Edit: I guess that when the ISS is completely in the dark, you could see only the light if it's aimed at you, but it would have to be pretty darn powerful to be even slightly visible. 




 It would be much better to use big, possibly coloured, mirrors.

Which doesn't sound like very useful payload. 

I think the people who are inspired when they see the ISS passing overhead don't really care what color it shines. I personally don't, white is just as awesome to me. 




 They did translate it correctly. Well, not the conspiracy theorists, but the people who actually study the Mayan calendar. The Baktun does end on December 21, that's perfectly true.

It's funny that people use this "leap year" rubbish to dismiss the doomsday rubbish, as both sides would see they're wrong after 2 minutes of actual research. 




 I don't see how nuclear power can be "statistically safer" than solar power. 




 ["The Meaning of Liff"](http://folk.uio.no/alied/TMoL.html) by Douglas Adams has a great section on this, read from CORRIEARKLET to CORRIEMUCHLOCH. I tried copy/pasting but it turned into a huge mess.
 




 Why "from the Hobbit"? Will he be featured in the movie? He's my favorite character from the books (hence the username), would make me very happy to see him somehow squeezed into the movie. (I also immediately thought of him when I saw the picture, btw) 




 You can find them [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/sites/radio/). I listened to them a long time ago, but when I try now I get the message "not available in your area". Hopefully it works for you. I try to get my hands on everything related to Last Chance to See, there's also a cd-rom with all the pictures they took that I managed to get my hands on recently. 




 Exactly, I personally dislike well-done meat, but I just can't understand the people saying "he got what he asked for." You certainly can make a well-done steak without burning it. I also hold nothing against people who like it that way, it's their tasteless meat, not mine. 




 I think the parenthesis is referring to the pilot that tried to ram him. I might be wrong, though, the sources don't help. 




 Followed a few links and got to [this](http://youtu.be/09GLj6fq-wg).
Kinda crept me out at around 0:32, had my headphones pretty loud. 
























 Thanks, so is [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O4EPHA/ref=noref?ie=UTF8 psc=1 s=electronics) the cable that I need?

I'll still look at some guides before I pull the trigger, don't want to mess this up.

The only things I can remember that I didn't take from LI were the RAM and optical drive, are those 2 alright? Any other comments on the parts are also highly appreciated.

The thing I'm most concerned about in the build are the cables, I get pretty lost when people start hooking everything up in the videos I watch. Is it easy to find clear instructions in the manuals? And most importantly, do I need to buy any cables, or are they all included with the parts? (the optical drive is what got me worried)

Thanks for any help. 




 WHO THE FUCK IS TOM BOMBADIL?

"He fucking is," said Goldberry. 




 And the lighthouse is [Farol da Barra](http://i.imgur.com/lLsqK.jpg) :) 




 That's the [National Congress of Brazil](http://i.imgur.com/AfX7k.jpg). 




 Anyone familiar with the guy playing Beorn? One of my favorite characters, and I always pictured him as a huge lumberjack sort of guy, not sure that actor looks the part. 




 I've only seen the the 100 in black, [like so.](http://www.absolut.com/content/products/images/absolut100/bottleImage.jpg) I have one of those around somewhere. 




 I can't find anything with that name, is it [this one](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16925-PLUGIN-PART-0-17-Aviation-Lights-v1-0?highlight=lights)?

 




 [Here's my Saturn V-inspired build](http://imgur.com/a/VFFax). As you can see, it was pretty tried and true on the Mun, always had enough fuel to make it back. Got me to Eve just by adding a bunch of boosters and one or two small modifications (though that lander was a one-way trip). 




 Patcher wasn't working for me, either.

But 0.17 finally appeared on the download page and it's been going pretty fast so far, seems like the best way to get it. 




 I personally like using [Heavens Above](http://www.heavens-above.com/).

If you want to see other satellites, I live in a pretty bright suburb and I don't bother with anything above a magnitude 1 (the lower the better). 
























 Diamond is the aircraft manufacturer that makes the plane in the picture. They also make one called the Katana, but it's not this one (it's a Twin Star).

To further explain, air traffic control sometimes replaces the first letters for the name of the manufacturer. 




 The only things that need fixing in that game are a shortcut to take things out of your bag and longer days. 

Other than that, the game is perfect, especially the music. 




 I'm... not correcting myself. It is near the horizon at sunrise, my first post wasn't wrong. 




 Yeah, it rises at sunset and sets at sunrise. My window is to the west so I see it setting at sunrise. 




 I only picked it up because I recently moved to an apartment where my bedroom window faces the west. I woke up one morning with the full moon near the horizon at sunrise and thought "oh yeah, that makes sense." 




 Just go [here](http://www.youtube.com/account), there should be a link to disconnect it from G+ right bellow your e-mail.

No need to delete your youtube account like the other guy said. 




 I think the biggest giveaway is that HL3 would make everyone change focus from all the Steam Box stuff, which they clearly put a huge effort into. That would be just a bad business plan.  




 Administrative assistant is just a fancy term for secretary/receptionist, in most cases. 




 It is, just got the notice I have premium today. 




 Great, thanks. 




 I'm doing my first build and intended to get my Windows 8 from Dreamspark, but at the checkout I see this message:

*c.  Using Windows Desktop Operating Systems.  Your DreamSpark Direct Subscription includes certain Windows operating system products. You may install these products only on a computer that is already licensed to run a full version of a Windows operating system on it, as evidenced by a valid Certificate of Authenticity (COA) for a Windows operating system affixed to the computer.*

Does that mean I can't use it for a build?
