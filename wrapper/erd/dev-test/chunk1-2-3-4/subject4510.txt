 I live in VB... ;/ 




 I try to time my flush so when I finish peeing, it's right as the water flushes down. 




 Hasn't aged a day 




 But I don't want to be seas and stars, I just wanna live forever and with the way medicine and technology have been progressing.. 




 Best advice, pay the $400-500 and make sure you're protected. 




 Some of those people are the most successful. I felt bad for one family. The house was 100k under 3 other similar listings (exact model condominiums) and we went in uncertain about what was wrong with the unit.. NOTHING, it was the agent. It took a week to get a hold of the agent, he had 30 listings, the key didn't work, had to wait another week to get in, had to schedule around tenants through the tenants. When we ratified a contract on the place, the next day I received an email from a closing coordinator, never talked to the agent ever again. I thought to myself this is a family that is 100k under the next listing, probably extremely motivated, and they think what a horrible market. The same week, another condominium sold for 505k (the one we purchased was 320k) 




 My name gives away my profession. Biggest shock to me is the range of people in the business. You have very professional, intelligent, hardworking Realtors and you have some people who really don't give a shit. The surprising thing is some of these bad agents are really successful. I'm working a deal right now where I have the clients calling me on a nightly basis because they can't get a hold of their agent. We we're supposed to meet on Tuesday morning at 9:30 am and he just never showed, texted me at 11:30 am to tell me his daughter was sick.... more likely slept in. 

I hope I'll never be like this but I'm a relatively new agent so I treat all my clients like kings and queens right now! haha 




 I'm a Realtor with Rose and Womble. I just checked REIN (MLS search engine for Realtors) there's quite a few options out there (29 when I just searched). Shoot me a PM if you want. 




 My dad's birthday was on the 2nd, he passed away on his birthday a year ago. It sucks man but you just have to treasure the time you had with him. 




 Never too early to start talking but be ready for a lot of questions. They'll want to know zoning, any common facilities (water, sewage, etc) 

Don't put your eggs all in one basket. Try to get as many builders over there as possible. The more people you can get over there, the more panic you'll create amongst them. Depending on how sought after the area is. 

But it never hurts to get the ball rolling. Some builders will tell you to get back to them when it's ready, and you should. Others will want to start negotiating immediately and that's even better because you can use pending of the subdivision to give you time to evaluate all possible avenues you can take.  




 Haha picked up a new client today, it's coming along!!! Plus I'm at office now but I mean don't get me wrong I sneak a peak on reddit while I'm taking a poo  




 I'm a Realtor that works with a builder and we specifically look for homes that need to be torn down or empty lots. 




 You said it's appraised at around that value, what's that exact value?
 




 How long have you been on the market?
 




 No problem, if you have anymore questions you can contact me- just shoot me a PM. If your a self motivator you'll do great. I was the same way, at the office at 6 AM and even though I was in more of a foreman role, I was always helping whether running equipment or having a shovel in my hand. So when I came over here I immediately transitioned to being in the office everyday at 9:00 am and I can say that 2 of my clients came to me because nobody else was in the office and we had a walk in. One of which equated to my first exclusive sale, hence the birth of my post. Good luck 




 * He's right, each brokerage works differently. A lot of the Franchise brokerages will offer more up front percentage cuts but will be loaded with Franchise fees. An example is my friend works for a large franchise and her cut is 70% but every transaction has a 'regional fee' of 7% and another office fee of 2%. I chose a local firm that's number one in business in my area, the initial percentage is lower at 57% but I chose this firm for three reasons; I have family in the firm, your percentage increases stay with you for the life of your time with the firm, and there's nothing extra taken out. 

* On the second half of your comment, I love this career, but I love socializing and being around people. I worked for the bridge division of a construction company and was a project manager working 60 hours a week. I can promise you, I work way more in real estate. It's an extremely demanding job and it requires a lot of money up front (around $2500 with Realtor dues if you take that route) and that's not counting the probably 3 months it will take you to get leads turned to clients turned to sales/listings. I'm in my 6th month and I have 3 listings I'm splitting 50/50, 3 closings (2 exclusive, one 50/50), and a handful of leads I'm working on turning into clients. You have to keep working open houses to keep the leads flowing in. You have to work your ass off during the week to translate the leads to clients. I'm working 7 days a week but the old adage if you enjoy what you do, you won't feel like you're working. Well I love what I do and I don't mind the time. If you wanna know anymore information let me know. Sorry if some of this is incomprehensible, just had a minute and figured I'd shoot you a response!

* I forgot to mention, very successful Realtors can get up to 90% cuts. Doing around 5 million in transactions will get you 80-85% in my office, so it's nothing unobtainable. 




 No you're exactly right. My grandmother is a Realtor as well. She's extremely successful in the business and drives a brand new Buick Enclave with every feature (Bose, leather, navi etc) When I take clients out I use her vehicle but it's also awkward because I have people ask me if it's my vehicle. I've used every excuse under the sun, no- vehicles having breaks, oil, detailed, blah blah. A lot of times I have had no choice but to use the Ranger and I can tell a real difference in the body language of my clients or prospective clients. 




 Not to drag this out but I read that it may be better to go through a credit union instead of the dealership? And thank you for the response. 




 I have a few problems. I own (no money owed) a 2000 off road Ford Ranger with 149,000 miles. 

* I'm a new Realtor in Virginia and I've quickly realized I need a new vehicle. I've been a Realtor for 6 months and my truck has been giving me a lot of issues plus not being very friendly on gas.

* I have fairly bad credit, a job that includes no guaranteed pay, and rent/utilities that cost me around $950 a month. I have my first 6 months of rent paid off already (from a previous closing I split with another agent) I have the Ford Ranger to trade in/sell (my guess is 3-4k value) and I have around $12,000 cash. 

* I would really like to purchase a used car for 10-14k, in a perfect world I could trade in my Ranger and put another 2-3k down and then have the car financed for an extremely long period (72 months would be preferable) but with the option to pay it off whenever. This would protect me from running low on cash in an unpredictable career but also be able to pay a few thousand every time I had a closing. 

* Is this type of deal possible, would a car dealership be willing to work with me on something like this? 




 I'm in the Hampton Roads area but I'm on it! Stupid office duty right now. Being a broker, any good advice? CRM Referral Maker or any of that stuff work? Thank you 




 Norfolk Botanical Gardens is great. Another great spot (mind you in Virginia Beach) is Bayville Park.  




 Well to be fair, we're a smaller office. I think we did 20 sales/listings last month in an office of about 15 active agents. But I have noticed this month has started off slow.

..Well played Sue 




 I did not know this, why I post on here about real estate related stuff. So how could you get a master list of what's available in your area? A perfect example is a condo I know is foreclosed on in a condominium I have a listing. 




 That's awesome, I remember when I was at PA. I would be at a football game and all of a sudden the rumor was PHARELL IS COMING IN A HELICOPTER AT HALF TIME!!! 4 years of this kind of stuff, never saw him once! Glad to see him back. 




 I'm not trying to deter you. I can't see the house and it may make sense. The only thing I would say beware of, is I work with a group of builders that typically tear down but occasionally flip homes as well. So I've seen a lot of older homes that have had this process done and they try so hard to make an extra room and it just looks terribly tacky/off. One room was divided and it made both rooms look like walk in closets. I've also seen rooms created that didn't make floor plan sense, bedroom between living room and kitchen. That probably doesn't apply to your loft but just my two cents.  




 This really isn't much help but if Bank of America owns the property, it should be listed on various listing services (MLS, Realtor.com, Zillow, Trulia etc) 

I'm clearly biased but I would look for a Realtor that specializes in REO's and have them look into it for you. The listing side pays commission so it wouldn't cost you anything. 




 AND YOU RANKED CHESAPEAKE THE THIRD MOST BORING CITY, HOW DARE YOU! 




 Realtor from Va here, I would never recommend anybody to use Quicken Loans. Typically if you have a local loan officer it's much more personal. After pre-qualification, communication is the most critical part. 


Good luck though,  I know it's got to be tough bouncing place to place. 




 Looks like a good time, I missed Harbor Fest this year.  




 Moobs is completely correct. I'm a Realtor in Virginia Beach. It's strange he did not disclose to you the difference between unrepresented and represented parties. Basically this protects the broker/agent from doing all the work and then you deciding to purchase without a broker/agent. If you like the Realtor and think he will do a good job, I would sign the sheet. But I would definitely demand he fill in the sheet first and walk you through the differences of being a customer or a client. 
 
























 Missed the Jesus story.., truth or dare? And there's a burning bush talking to me.

 I lost my dad a year and a half ago on the day of his birthday... hang in there. 




 I appreciate the sound advice. 




 I don't see a bible? I see a post about a bad Realtor. 




 I'm relatively new to investing as a whole. So far in investing I put $1000 in GTAT at 16.50 and when it dropped to 13.90, I put another $1000 in. 

I know it's a big risk and honestly I don't really care. Not that I don't care about money but I'm 28 and I'm not tied up to any large financial burden. I would like to put $500 to $1,000 in a handful of penny stocks but not for day trading. I really would like to put my money in some up and coming companies.

I've been looking at a few weed stocks such as NGMC but also curious if weed does become nationally legalized if someone like Phillip Morris would just consume that market and change it's business model. 

Always curious about future tech companies; 3D printing, graphene, etc. 


- Penny stocks for long term investments? Speculative penny stocks with a real chance for a future?
 




 How much for the bathroom accessory
 




 I know..., there is a billion books on real estate. I'm a young Realtor and I'm trying to perfect my descriptions of properties. Double cove crown molding, built-in buffet, picture frame wainscoting. Is there a book that would have visual descriptions of home features. 




 Somehow this kept slipping under the radar for me. I received the book for Christmas and then lost it. Was cleaning out my grandfathers car and found it in there and just started reading it last night.... and I found five dollars.

 How the hell was GEIG at $170 and now it's at .01? 




 CRISS CROSS 




 My listing package is a video virtual your ($200), Home Warranty Supplied for buyer ($400), agreement to have the house open every Saturday/Sunday for the first 6 weeks and I never use a lock box . If an agent wants to show the property I'm always present because who knows the house better, the listing agent or an agent that's never been inside. With that said I never negotiate commission and a lot of Realtors list for 1-2% and never do anything. Really get what you pay for. 




 That's like 2-3 days ago on Shore Drive we had a helicopter, multiple boats, and 2 cruisers parked on the Lesner. I was listening on the police scanner from my place and they were looking for a kiteboarder until it was too dark to continue the search. My girlfriend works for WTKR and I asked her and she never heard anything and I never saw anything mentioning the search.  




 Complete stock newb so be gentle but when I look this stock up I can't find it. 




 Great post for a newbie like myself. Question... If I still purchased $1000 when it was .10 and I sold it at $20.00 and I was an unknowing purchaser. Could I technically sell and walk away making a huge profit? Or because they are bouncing back and forth would it make it difficult for me to sell? 




 Thats rouggggh!
 




 I just wish on Monday I put my life savings into CYNK and on Thursday I sold it all off, my weekend would have been delightful 




 There's plenty of options I'm a Realtor in Virginia Beach - shoots a pm with some contact info and I'll help you out .  




 It was my walk out song for baseball; Lupe Fiasco, 'Emperors Soundtrack'

The weakness of the hard

 I see that but I also see that they are opening another plant so I was thinking long term it will bounce back. 




 I just put a $1000 into GTAT, any other company stocks to look out for?  




 Where in Va just out of curiousity?  




 I've put it down for clients before. As mentioned the preparation is everything. I spent 2 days cleaning (intense cleaning, acid etching to pull up the protective layer put on it) but actually putting the epoxy down only only took me a few hours (2 car garage). If you're interested I'll post some pictures of the finished product. We matched the shudders and people loved it. The house sold in 5 weeks, I'm not going to say that's why but it definitely helped the home show well.   
























 Don't go to college, get a 9 to 5 job, save up my money, and google "Bitcoin" religiously... and patiently wait. 




 Just wanted to say thank you, downloaded GIMP and did all my logos and all my head shots last night. My index finger is exhausted but it's done.


Here is some of my work just so you know your time wasn't wasted:
http://i.imgur.com/b9Nd9cF.png

next up... how to post imgur photos correctly lol 




 I think your pops looks like a hippie Brad Pitt 




 I hope this is the correct place. I'm a Realtor ... in Virginia as my name has given away. I've noticed a few photos, including one we have at our disposal, can be used on flyers and websites where only the picture is shown. No background or blank space so if you place a different colored background, there is not a square or block. The one example I have is we have a company logo with a .png format that can be placed on anything and it's only the Logo, no block or white background. What exactly is this called? And can you do it with a mac with basic software, no photoshop etc.? I would really like to do it with my headshot and some additional logos (Realtor logo etc.)

I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge and probably terrible description but any help would be welcome. Also is there any companies that do ? 

Thank you 




 Wow... good sir, you have made my day 




 I loved when Jill held up the "TALK" card and it perfectly covered her mom's mouth.  




 Gang bang 




 buzzkill 




 I got hooked onto the Lord of the Rings game on my phone, became my nightmare. Finally just gave the account away just to not do any further damage. 




 This was my first and really only gaming addiction. I'm 28 yearsold, haven't played in years, and still occasionally check into UO website/ Stratics community to see what's going on.  




 How much did you pay for the little guy? And can you post more pictures/videos? I love olde English bulldogs I've been checking out a breeder for about 2 years but still not quite where I want to be in life where I can get one. 




 Imagine how blue balled Kevin was. 




 Is it just me or does Gladys look a little stoned in this episode... 




 Dad it's a cat and.... SHUT THE FUCK UP JILL.  




 Wtf is happening... Cocaines one hell of a drug 




 Such a bad show 




 Do you ever hear the ICQ message noise near cash registers in gas stations etc. 




 You should never negotiate for repairs to be done after a closing. It's always wise to have the repairs re-inspected by a professional after repairs are made, thought I won't lie, I don't always recommend that if it's only a few hundred dollars of repairs. 




 NO ULTIMA ONLINE?! You've never played a MMO 




 Laser Pointer. 




 I'm 28, much too old for this kind of imagination. But when I saw this today and kept picturing Foley still alive next to this coward. I wish I could have just teleported there, as this dirtball spoke into his 3rd world GoPro, with a machine gun, and spray that sick bastard down.  




 Only thing that worries me about NTEK. I feel like eventually the native 4k will be built within the TV's  




 You think it's hyped now..... 




 Would love to hear that. 




 I know this is purely speculation but I'm just curious, what do you think will be the ceiling of the GTAT stock if Apple released that the sapphire will be used on ALL iPhones and the upcoming iWatch.

Once again I know it's speculation but curious peoples responses that are much wiser then me.  




 Oh.... oh yes!  




 Well now I can sit in silence and feel like a real Einstein, thank you.

I think that this was the first episode that really made me enjoy the story as a whole. Before this episode, even though it felt like some of the story lines were coming together, they still felt mostly frayed.  




 I could go on for hours about the death of Gladys. My girlfriend doesn't get home for an hour, and I'm just sitting in silence mind fucked. 

Why did they kill Gladys? Did they really kill Gladys? What does it say about Gladys that she was begging for her life during the stoning? Did Gladys death really do that much good? Wtf is Patti saying 99% of the time? Why was it so important for her to die? Why did Kevin have to understand THAT way?  WHY, WHY, WHY!?! 




 OMG.. The glass?!? The neck?!? But in the end... I still have no idea what I'm watching and I will be back next Sunday. 




 I definitely will update this post if anyone is interested. I put another $2,000 into GTAT on Thursday. I have 2 closings this upcoming week but hopefully after I get through the craziness I can continue studying investments and invest a few more thousand.  




 Purchased and received today. Not exactly what I was looking for but will definitely be a great starting place. I'll read this first.  
























 Well I've checked out SotA, my problem is with the PvP. I was big into mage PvP. I loved how you could literally have 70 key commands and if you really worked at it, you could beat 10v1. I don't see that with SotA. I also don't like the camera angle which appears less conducive to that sort of gameplay. 

Guild Wars seems to really get the closest as to what I would want a "new" UO to look like. But instead of a zoom, scrolled out and above. But the open world aspect of a pre-Trammel UO is not in Guild Wars DNA. UO was fun whether you we're a PKer or a Hunter/Miner/Gatherer etc because of the fear of being outside of the walls of the city. And while the guards could basically insta-hit you, it was a lot more engaging then what a lot of games do by creating "PvP zones" where you have to enter load areas etc. 

I wish I had a billion dollars to produce my own hardcore game that was more about a world with realistic boundaries and magic/fantasy sprinkled on top than a whole world that just constantly reminds you it's phony *sighs* 




 Could this be a sign that EA may be working with Garriott to bring SoTA into UO2. I know it's much later now but months ago I remember him answering that question with yes, it wouldn't be difficult to take what he had and create a UO2 if EA was willing to give all control the Richard.  




 6 weeks ago my baseball fantasy team was ranked number 6 and I probably wasn't even going to make the playoffs (only 4 teams get in) I added Jeter, haven't lost a game since and I'm winning the championship game by 150 points.  




 Thank you 




 Mmmm well then offer 3000, who cares, lol 

As long as there is no offers and they are willing to counter, it can't hurt to try to get it at a lower price. 




 Regardless what you do, if it's a fire sale it will be gone quickly so just get an offer in and receive a counter. 




 Best day ever. 




 Also her disappearance is similar to 5-6 other missing people in the last few years.  




 It started off as a joke but I picked up Derek Jeter. He is absolutely crushing the ball in the last week. I guess pitchers are just throwing fast balls down the cock for him. Should I start him this week? He's facing a lot of less than stellar pitchers.  




 I was at a recreational baseball park where I had a game later that day when I was around 13, this girl was hovering over my shoulder and when I looked at her she told me I had really clean ears.... about 10 minutes later one of her friends handed me her number.  




 I know it's in the game but I'm looking for a controller layout for the xbox one in the PDF or text layout that I can print... I'm tired of going back and forth.

Does anyone have a link? Thank you 




 I would love if you had a site like that as well. I'm in the process of remodeling a bathroom and it would be great to see all the issues that are ahead of me.  




 I personally roll the dice on Tanaka. The Yankees aren't theoretically out of it so they'll definitely want the win. Will he throw a CG, 100% no way but I think he has the opportunity to throw 6. 




 As defending champion, ordinary citizens (my friends) begged for me to lose. As I barely made it into the playoffs (didn't make playoffs until last week) people didn't take me serious. Now as I close on my opponent (#1 seed, which was 21-2) and prepare for the championship, I ask ... What should I do with my starting rotation. This is a head to head matchup and it involves total points, not winning categories. 

My playoff bullpen:

 I'm personally making a big bet on this stock. I feel like it's near the bottom and I have moved all stock money into just GTAT. I'm also in no need for that money and plan to be waiting for quite some time. (6 months - 1 year) 




 Title says it all, on Fox Fantasy it shows as yes but reading a few sites says otherwise. 




 SAMESIES!!
 




 How they started on Tuesday, 5 days later = Sunday? And all games all week, no days off 









 Why did they push back his next start until the Cardinals? He was one of my double-starters this week, wtf. 




 wow 




 I'm in first round playoff, guy I'm playing had Cashner and was sending me shit talking text messages all Tuesday. Haven't heard from him since around the 6th inning of Arrietas CG 




 Mannnnnnnnnnnn I hope that's the case because I'll need all the help I can get.  




 I lost McHugh last night too, hopefully he still pitches Saturday or Sunday.  




 I dominated but it just happened to be my opponent had TRUMBO AND CASHNER.. *begins to weep* 




 Honestly.. I live near Oceana and we get this on the daily. I guess I'm spoiled but video was eh 




 Damnit, he's a double starter for me. First round of playoffs. 




 All I saw was McHugh was pulled for injury delay, WHAT HAPPENED!?!?  




 I would make a badass video game that's pretty much pre-aos ultima online but a lot cooler. 




 I can't tell if your comments are encouraging my sexual comments or if everyone is oblivious to all the innuendos. 

hahaha shave your wood!  Boxes!! Wood!! Rough wood!! Ok it's out of my system.  




 Everyone knows how to do that.
