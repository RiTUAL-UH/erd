 I think about good times I've had in the past (memories of friends, family, and other happy moments). Aside from that I look forward into the future and imagine myself in 2-3 years and how different I would be if I kept a positivite outlook on life.  




 Good question. I've had a fear of the dark and a fear of heights since I was a little boy. 16 years later I still have the same fears... 




 Kaga Koko Puffs 




 I couldn't agree with you more! I also do wish more people would watch this anime and see how much of a masterpiece it truly is. One of my favorite Shounen animes out there. 




 My personal favorite is King but I also like Ban too.  




 Yes!! I love the fight between Meliodas and Ban! I think we will meet Gowther (Sin of Lust) next episode. 




 I dont recognize the bottom two but the very first picture is Shiki from Kara no Kyoukai. 




 I started watching it 2 days ago and I'M IN LOVE WITH IT. The plot gives me an Akame Ga Kill vibe and I'm starting to like it more than AGK.  




 I got nothing. Barakamon is literally the embodiment of the perfect slice of life and comedy anime. Also,

NARU KOTOISHI IS TOO DAMN CUTE 




 Nanatsu no Taizai (Seven Deadly Sins) 




 Oh? The Seven Deadly Sins. But shouldn't Escanor know that they weren't the ones who killed Zaratras because they did find his dead body. 




 Interesting, never really thought Escanor could be a future antagonist. Can you tell me what NNT stands for? Sorry, I'm not really familiar with all the abbreviations yet. 




 Just started watching Seven Deadly Sins yesterday and I'm fully caught up in the anime. I love it so far! However, after browsing through the wiki I found that there was one member of the Seven Deadly Sins that wasn't introduced yet in the anime or the manga - Escanor. Where do you think he is and when do you think he'll appear in the manga or in the anime? 




 What server do you play on? If it's Alexina feel free to add me, xsoulstealx! 




 Plot twist: It's actually a guy's butt 




 Wise words said by the one and only alphapussy. 




 Rainbow Nisha is one of my favorite anime's I've ever seen. The plot, the theme, music all blended really nicely. Wasn't a big fan of the animation but I looked past that. Rainbow was the first anime in a while that really impacted me when I finished watching it. All the struggles that the boys went through during prison and after really depicts the problems people face today. In the end it also, despite sounding cliche, shows us the importance of friendship. I agree with you about how the show is underrated. Wish more people would know about this hidden gem.  




 LIESSSS!!! I loved Code Geass R2 wayy more than the first season. I felt that everything picked up and they took the plot to a whole new level. There were so many more twists in R2.  




 I'd have to agree 




 MY SAME EXACT THOUGHTS!!!
 




 Love triangle became a love hexagon after the time skip lol 




 I finished it back in spring of last year. It was amazing!!! I was surprised that no one really heard of Nagi Asu beforehand. I recommended it to a friend and she loved it.  




 I agree with your list except for Aldnoah.Zero. I didn't really hear much from that anime and I heard it was good but it didn't really seem all that popular compared with the rest. I also forgot to mention that Akame ga Kill was pretty hyped too 




 I think No Game No Life was pretty hyped up this year. It was a good show, fairly decent plot, and entertaining, but was it as good as people made it out to be? No. It didn't deserve all the attention it received. I know SEVERAL people will probably hate me for saying that but if you disagree, which 2014 anime do you think was more hyped? 




 Yeah I could imagine that the first half of senior year is pretty stressful but after you get accepted into one of the colleges that you applied to, wouldn't the rest of senior year be pretty relaxed? Sure you still have to attempt to maintain your grades and what not but other than that you don't have to worry about SAT's and stuff. 




 Wow! You're one of the few people I know who actually have a plan on what they're gonna do in college. I still haven't fully decided. At the moment, I could swing either way or maybe even major in something completely different. For the most part I haven't really thought much about college as I'm still caught in the midst of SAT's and trying to maintain my GPA. The amount of stress in Junior year is ridiculous. 




 I was in a similar predicament back in February this year. I had a female friend that I slowly developed a crush on. During a party I saw another one of my guy friends touching her (ass + boobs) and cuddling with her. I immediately felt angry and jealous. The next few weeks after the party was complete shit as my anger was eating me alive. Eventually I got used to them and I moved on. It still hurts once in a while but definitely not as much as it was before. You'll be fine dude, my advice would be to distract yourself by finding pleasure in your hobbies. Only time can heal a broken heart. 




 Nice! I'm actually debating whether or not to pursue Biomedical Engineering or do something in Business. If I could be accepted into NYU Stern that'd be great! 




 Not normally. I've been in several matches where people lynched someone just because they didn't like their name or something stupid like that. Technically this could be a reason but is it a legitimate motive? No. The voters also generally follow the majority so if someone starts to vote for somebody everyone else would usually follow. This might not happen in every match but it is a common pattern. 




 You could argue for it both ways. Pretty much on Day 2 there is rarely any hard evidence that proves someone to be Mafia, SK, or any evil role so as a result people act like idiots and decide to vote for a random person. Sure every lynch serves a purpose but what makes it a random lynch is when people have no proof or have a reasonable explanation on why they want to lynch them.  




 This is probably one of the most inspirational things I've read in a while. I know for a fact that a common issue most teens face is identity. We're stuck in between childhood and adulthood and many of us are confused and struggling to find our own purpose in life. Not to mention the fact that teachers and parents only seem to add more stress that isn't needed. Your story does a great job in showing these challenges  but what's more amazing is how you managed to turn your life around rather then drowning in your own sorrow. Great story and message. Thanks for posting this! 




 Good point. :) 




 Nice! I love reading stories like these, it's so interesting! This actually reminds me of one of my matches when I was playing as Godfather in All Any. It was day 3 when all my other mafia members died (consort and consigliere). It was only me left in the game because the SK left the game on Night 1. The town was feeling pretty good since there was only 1 mafia remaining so I could sense that they weren't in any hurry and pretty much thought they had the game in the bag. I dont remember all of the details but somehow I managed to deceive the 11 townies and somehow won the game by myself on Day 8. The chat after they found out i was the last Mafia was hilarious! 




 This is a cool concept but I feel like having a ranking system wouldn't be fair for some players. Random lynches happen pretty much in every match and even if you do have a pretty good understanding of the game, ToS is very dependent on the cooperation of other players. Not to mention the fact that there are trolls and idiots who play too. Ultimately having a ranking system probably wouldn't turn out very well. Even if they do incorporate it then it wouldn't be fair for everyone. 




 I like your hair 









 Theguyhiding. I'm fairly new at this game so I'm not that great yet. I think I have a pretty good grasp on the basics, I just don't know any other complex strategies.  




 DAMN! Add me on steam: theguyhiding. I sorta got the hang of it today when i played a match with a friend but I still don't know like advanced tactics or strategies. I like to play as Wu Zetian.

 I just got Civ 5 Brave New World yesterday on Steam as a Christmas present. Last night was the first time I've ever played anything in the whole Civlization franchise. I did the tutorial but I'm still confused at what I'm supposed to be doing early game. Does someone want to do multiplayer with me and help walk me through some stuff? Thank you!

Edit: I live on the east coast and I can play normally from 11:30 AM - 2:00 PM and from 5:30 PM - 8:00 PM 




 Same here I have two research papers due at the end of this winter break. I also have a lot of other schoolwork and SATs to prepare for. So far I haven't completed a single thing but w/e 




 16/M
Yes, I do watch porn because it relieves me of stress
I agree with others about porn getting boring. Thats why I watch more hentai.
HENTAI FTW
I do have some female friends who watch porn too because we share our porn and hentai lol idk if thats normal 




 That sucks and I didn't get anything last Christmas either. I know that feel  




 Wow dude that's really depressing and horrible. I wish your family the best of luck next year though  




 Thanks for letting me know! I'll ask my sister if she wants to link it to my Steam account. Merry Christmas to you too! 




 Pretty lousy, Got Civilization 5 on Steam but it's on my sister's account so I can't really play it too frequently and some chocolate cookies.  




 I didn't get anything all that extraodinary. This year I only really got two presents. One was from my older sister, she suppossedly brought me Civilization 5 on Steam but it's on her Steam account so I can't really play it. I also got a a few chocolate cookies from my mom as my second present. Pretty lousy Christmas if you ask me but it's better than some of the previous years. Christmas 2010 I got a pencil sharperner from my mom AND dad. I'm being serious. Then I go back from break every year and my friends and classmates ask me what I got for "Christmas" and I just tell them that my family doesn't celebrate it. Remember guys if you think you received lame presents hopefully this story will make you feel better about yourself.

Edit: Thanks for posting guys! It's nice to see what you guys got this year and it made me feel more grateful about the stuff I've received this year and in the past.  





























 Wish someone made or recontinued this thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/28whcw/what_is_your_worst_poop_horror_story/ 




 As a fellow gamer, I know what it's like to drift away from an internet friend. Your experience really reflects on my time in the gaming community. You should find this Kelbertinghoess Flappers dude and talk to him. Catch up on the good ol' times before it becomes too late. 




 Found out about reddit when I decided to type in "worst poop stories" on google just for the kicks... Never in my life have I laughed so hard for such an amount of time 




 Kamina from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Bulat and Sheele from Akame Ga Kill. Kana and the mother's death from Parasyte. And many other surprise sudden deaths in the animes I've seen. 




 What happens if both sides got pissed on? 




 Now that's downright cruel. At first I thought she was being extreme but that takes things to a whole new level. My parents more specifically my mom used to resort to physical beatings as punishment and at times I was left with marks on my body. I had a few friends ask me about it as they know my Mom is downright crazy sometimes but I just shrugged it off as an injury I received while biking or something. However, I knew at the very least my mom was concerned for my future and had intentions of me getting into a good college. Your mom is awful and I hope no one has to go through anything you did. I'm glad to hear you're doing better now *internet hug* :) 




 Crazy ass muggles these days.... 




 Wow, I really feel for you dude! My parents were on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to yours. My mother rather than forcing me to sleep at 8 pm every night, forced me to complete all my school work and other activities even if it means going to sleep at 4 AM. There were other few similarities as she would blame me for being sick, calling me a dumbass everytime I got a cold or a fever. My mother could care less about my social problems, if I received an A or lower she would give me hell for it and most of the time it ended up with severe beatings. I remembered she whipped me with my Dad's belt when i was in 6th grade for getting a C. Part of me feels like that both our parents were trying to be "good" parents but ended up being way too extreme in their child rearing. 




 Well at least you're fine now! :D 




 And who gave you the authority to tell him that? He has every right if not more to reproduce than the rest of us. 




 Oh shit.... 









 Same here! I never learned to spell definately correctly until the 10th grade. 









 One line from Rebirthing by Skillet is "I come alive somehow" but I always sing it as "I paralyzed a cow" 




 /u/StickleyMan has more 




 Freedom of Speech. 




 /u/StickleyMan has the most comment karma, link karma, and trophies I've ever seen for one redditor. 




 I never felt full support from my parents in anything I wanted to accomplish. They simply brushed it off or they tried to act like they cared. I never had a social life either which is another thing I greatly resent them for. 




 The only thing I'm looking forward to is that I'll be in college in less than two years so I don't have to deal with this kind of nonsense. I picked up Reddit actually because it's my form of relief from my parents. To them, Reddit looks like an educational website or something like Wikipedia lol 




 I couldn't agree more with you. My mother and father have always used an extremely authoritative/restrictive child rearing practice. I was not allowed to have friends over, go to a friends house, and at times I wasn't even allowed to go outside. My mother also has an anger management issue. If she found me doing anything not education related she would flip out and cuss while throwing furniture at me. My dad tried to understand things from my point of view but at the end of the day he just sides with my mom. Because of this, I never really had too many friends, only a few close ones that really help me. While its not direct, when or if I ever have children I've made a vow to myself I would not put them in any form of abuse and restriction my parents have put me in. 









 Wow! I really feel for you dude. That's exactly the situation for my parents. My mothers a bipolar psycho bitch sometimes and my dad would always side with her no matter the situation. The amount of verbal AND physical abuse my sister and I received is ridiculous. Aside from that she was extremely uptight about the rules and wouldn't let me out of the house for nearly anything except for school and SAT classes. I was never allowed to play games or hang out with friends. One time I was caught playing a computer game when she wasn't around and she began throwing furniture all around the house and at me all the while cussing at me in her native language, saying how I'm a complete utter failure and I would never accomplish anything succesful in my lifetime. My dad just says it's our fault for my mom being crazy. 




 Love should come to everybody naturally. With that being said, there isn't really anything you should do to obtain love. The only thing you have to do is be yourself and wait for the time to come. 




 Thanks for clarifying. I agree with you on how their wages should be higher. 




 Really? Tipping waiters and waitresses is a common courtesy. They make next to minimum wage and actually majority of their income comes from the tips they receive from their customers. And honestly giving 15% of your bill as a tip isn't really asking for too much. Most people think working as a waiter is a simple job until they actually do it. Theres A LOT more work involved than you would think. 




 I agree with several of the responses here however the thing that irks me the most is when people compare you to others. A constant example would be my parents when they say "Why can't you be like that Asian kid over there who takes 7 different AP classes, has a 4.9 GPA, 2400 SAT Score, president of 4 different clubs, and captain of 3 different varsity level sports". We're all born differently but does that make us any less than each other? No. Everyone has their own strong points and weaknesses. Those who fail to acknowledge that truth are forever ignorant. 




 My eighth grade Language Arts teacher. She was racist and despite claiming she didn't have favorites, it was clear that she favored white people over ANY othe race. For example, she asked a question and called on me. I answered her question only for her to say it's completely wrong and incorrect. 10 seconds later, a sterotypical blonde hair blue eyes white girl raises her hand and SAYS ALMOST THE EXACT SAME THING I SAID and the teacher congratulates her and showers her in compliments. I'm not the only one who hated her, nearly all my other classmates despised her and wished she would quickly retire.  




 I have two, You Found Me - The Fray and How to Save a Life - The Fray. Those songs has gotten me through several of my darkest moments in life, even through various times when I was about to attempt suicide. Even now, I still listen to it whenever I'm going through some tough times.

Heres what Isaac, one of the songwriters of this song, said about it:
""You Found Me is a tough song for me. Its about the disappointment, the heart ache, the let down that comes with life. Sometimes you're let down, sometimes you're the one who lets someone else down. It gets hard to know who you can trust, who you can count on. This song came out of a tough time, and I'm still right in the thick of it. There's some difficult circumstances my family and friends have been going through over the past year or so and can be overwhelming. It wears on me. It demands so much of my faith to keep believing, keep hoping in the unseen. Sometimes the tunnel has a light at the end, but usually they just look black as night. This song is about that feeling, and the hope that I still have, buried deep in my chest."
 









 Well said. I completely agree with you but the OP should also contact the police and notify them about this situation.  




 If I were in his shoes, I would be extremely pissed at my parents. If what the OP said was true on how it was a "small incident", his father should be the one apologizing to him. His father already broke the law by kicking him out of the house before 18 and without giving him at least any notice. These kinds of things are ridiculous.  




 Thanks, I'll keep this in mind. What they don't understand is that I can balance my work and have fun. I don't need them nagging me about homework, violin, SAT's, or anything else. I think I'm perfectly capable of handling my own activities. Another thing they don't understand is the concept of relaxing or having fun. I doubt there is any human being that can work nearly every hour of the day without having some form of break. In the past I talked to them about this issue and the only reply I got was "Sure, instead of working on schoolwork we'll let you practice your violin for 1-2 hours". Not only that, my mother is sort of a control freak, everything HAS to go her way otherwise she'll literally scream and throw furniture. It's nearly impossible to negotiate with her. My dad I'll admit is a bit more understanding but at the end of the day he still sides with my mother. Really the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that I'll be in college next year. Of course I won't go crazy and party, do drugs, or any other of those things.  




 I'm actually the president of my school's Chess Club. It's the only actual activity they'll allow me to participate because chess is an intellectual game. However when I'm home, they won't let me play any games, not even chess. 




 Before I get started, I'm not trying to elicit sympathy. I only want advice and if anyone else can relate to this please tell me your feelings. My parents, mostly my mother, doesn't allow me to play any kind of games. They keep a close eye on my grades and expect me to be doing work every hour I'm awake whether its completing my schoolwork, working on SATs, or practicing the violin. Of course, as a result of this, this also means that I can't go out with friends, talk with friends on the internet, and I can't watch T.V (they even canceled cable television because they think its ruining my health). In fact last year I got into a huge argument with them about me having a facebook because they found out I was using it to talk with other classmates. So basically, it feels like I'm stuck in a prison, unable to do anything but work. Most of the time I these feelings inside but lately after my mother found out I was secretly playing some video games on the computer when she wasn't around, she went completely apeshit by threatening to break the computer, throwing random furniture, and cussing. The worst part is that my dad doesn't do anything to help, he simply says it was my fault for making my mother angry and abusive. I know they only want the best for me and think they're helping me get into a good college and have a succesful future but I can't help to feel that they're being too extreme. Because of this, in the past few years I've suffered from stress and several anxiety attacks. The only form of relief I get in my daily life is actually reddit. My parents think reddit is some kind of educational website like wikipedia or something. 




 Nice try Jigsaw

 I remember bits and pieces of my last dream from a few weeks ago. I was playing hide and seek with one of my friends from school when it somehow ended up with us having sex.

"JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!" 




 http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/662/092/83e.jpg 




 "Babies come from daddy. The nuts inside daddy's scrotum (the sack below his wee-wee) make millions of microscopic homunculus every day. Each of these homunculus is a microscopic baby. 

Sometimes daddy and mommy will play around when you're not there. When they want a baby, daddy will stick his pee-pee in mommy's mouth or in mommy's poo-poo hole. Hee hee, mommy and daddy think this is a lot of fun for some reason. Since mommy and daddy don't get fun toys that's the best thing they can think of doing to play. Gross. They will probably get very mad if you ask them. They like to keep this weird behavior secret, but that's how babies get started. 

Sometimes mommy and daddy will watch movies and read books about other mommies and daddies doing this; these are called "adult" items since they are too gross for others to want to watch. 

Anyway, after daddy sticks his pee-pee in places he shouldn't, the many homunculus will travel all around inside mommy. If one of them makes it to mommy's tummy then the homunculus will be able to stay and eat the yummy food in mommy's tummy. Usually none make it there, which is why you don't have a new baby every day. Other times two or more will make it, and then you have twins. 

For the baby to breathe it makes a small umbilical cord out of things mommy eats and lets this go out either mommy's mouth or poo-poo hole. The baby uses this like a snorkel. 

Oral Contraceptives have been invented by scientists to prevent babies from happening if daddy puts his wee-wee in mommy's mouth. There are no anal contraceptives yet to prevent babies from happening if daddy puts his pee-pee elsewhere, all very bad ideas anyway. 

After about nine months of the baby eating inside of mommy then mommy has had enough of this and goes into labor. This is very painful. During labor mommy will squeeze the baby through her intestines and finally squeeze it out her poo-poo hole. This is very painful, which God did as a punishment to people for Adam and Eve misbehaving in Eden. 

An abortion is when the mommy changes her mind and decides to poop out the baby early. The baby just goes down the toilet. Actually many miscarriages happen this way. A miscarriage is when a baby dies inside the mommy." -Yahoo Answers

 I was in 6 or 7th grade when I had my first masturbating experience. Like most other boys that age, when I was about to climax I thought it was going to pee so I ran to the bathroom. Later on I remember being confused on why my pee was white with a creamy color so I decided to ask my mom... 




 This reminds me of a classmate that sits next to me during lunch. Everytime you say hi to him or have a very simple brief conversation, he'll flex as hard as he can just to show off his biceps, pecs, etc. Yeah sure I know you work out dude. Good for you, stop showing off...

 All Mods

How do you guys earn your money? I know /u/icephoenix21 sells crystal ilbis and balanced furies. 




 I'm more of an anime person but yeah I agree.

 Anime. Most people assume anime is for little children but they're very *very* wrong... 




 I meant it as a joke....

 Wanking off actually is a great way to fall asleep as it helps to relieve stress and to take your mind off of things. Other than that I watch anime until I get tired...  









 Thanks for answering! One last question, is making crystal ilbi's your main source of income or do you go on gollux runs and stuff too? At first I thought about making money off of Gollux but my damage is so bad I can't solo it even on easy so thats why I need some money to get better gear and stuff.   




 How long did all the prequests take? What level do you recommend someone should  be before they start making crystal ilbi's? How long does selling one take?

Sorry for all the questions but I think I might try to make crystal ilbis now when I have a chance. At first I thought it was incredibly annoying to make but looking at it now, it doesn't seem that hard.  




 Yeah I know, I wasn't asking specifically if you would make one for me but rather if I can accompany you while you make them or work on my own set while you're there. I'm also on Scania btw also, I used to play ms five years ago so my guild has been inactive for a long time. 




 Thank you! I probably won't be going on maplestory for today but whenever I have a chance I'll add you. My username is xDKnightzx1. 
 




 But if I recalled the drop rate for the badge's weren't very high and also don't you need 100 dark crystals to make one set of balanced furies? Oh and what server are you on? If it isn't too troubling for you can you help assist me in making one set :D? 




 How? Care to explain or perhaps teach me? 




 They both are quite hard to make as they require a lot of exepensive materials and a lot of time spent on the prequests. 




 That's like asking why does your arm hurt when it's broken or fractured.

 Hannah Montana 




 My mom's giving away all my childhood toys to charity. I know I'm way too old to be playing with those toys but I can't help but feel empty... it feels like she's giving my childhood away :( 




 Look at the bright side of things! Take time to enjoy college life and hang out with friends. Chances are you'll be missing college when you graduate. 




 I can relate to your social anxiety as sometimes I would have trouble speaking whats on my mind without worrying what other people think of me. It got better for me, however, when I learned to stop giving a shit about what other people think of me and to speak what's on my mind even if I do sound like a fool. Just remember, people aren't very judgemental about what you say and generally they'll forget it in a while. It's better to say what's on your mind then keep it inside. Good luck! 




 I had sort of a similar situation with one of my friends in high school but it was nowhere as extreme as yours and we weren't as close as you and your friend. It started off similarly, a new girl transfered to my high school and had similar interests (ex: league of legends, anime, manga). We seemed to be pretty close for a while and then things started to fall apart as she met new people. I began to notice it at the beginning of junior year when she didn't invite me to her birthday party. Since then I've talked to her less and less to the point where I can hardly consider her a friend anymore, much rather as an acquaintance or simply a classmate. Like you, I was taken aback by this and I spent a while trying to restore the relationship but it wasn't the same. In your case, I think you should just move on and meet new people and make new friends. If she's that inconsiderate to your opinions and wishes maybe you should reevaluate your friendship with her. It probably hurts to cut ties with her but it's probably for the best. Keep in mind as painful as it is, friendships don't always last forever... 




 If you can't bring yourself to stop cheating then it would be best to end the relationship right now. It might sound horrible, but it would save you from the eventual drama later on when she does find out. It's not too late though, swear and committ to yourself you won't cheat on your girlfriend or SO ever again. Stay true to your promise and things will get better! 




 I made a vow to myself that I'll never use the same child rearing tactics my parents had used on me. 




 I get the same feeling when I finish watching a good anime. 




 I feel you dude. My mom is exactly like you, except she criticizes me mostly on school or academics. Ever since I was a kid, I've never had a social life. It was always study, study, study.... or practice the violin. Things got exponentially worse when I went into middle school. All of a sudden, it seemed like if I didn't receive an A (90 or higher) I would be a total failure for the rest of my life. In fact in 6th grade she whipped me with my dad's belt and locked *and* blocked the door so I couldn't run. Aside from that, there are multiple instances where they threaten to disown me if I didn't reach their expectations or they would say I would be better off dead so I can't disgrace them further. Honestly I've learned to deal with (mostly my mom's) bullshit. She's also incredibly bipolar, sometimes she'll be in a good mood but when she's in a bad mood, every little thing would piss her off. Something as small as spilling a glass of water would make her scream at you for at least an hour. As for my social life, I'm only allowed to hang out with my friends "occasionally" (once or twice every year). I'm not allowed to play any video games (last time she found out she was hitting me with a chair). I'm not allowed to watch T.V which is impossible anyways because she canceled our cable service back when I was in 7th grade. Luckily for me, she made my father try to monitor what I'm doing on the internet but they both suck at using computers or technology in general so they don't know about incognito. Honestly, the only thing that keeps me going is knowing that the future will be better when I can move out. Until then, I have to keep up with this. You're not alone dude :) and I'm sure this is common for A LOT of asians out there. Sometimes it can be hard to keep your emotions inside (in fact I'm letting my anger out right now) but just do well not for the sake of them but for the sake of yourself! 




 My junior health teacher told me this in high school: "You don't need to have all the answers when you're 16-18, it's perfectly fine if you don't know what you want to do in the future." I wish people would acknowledge this instead of constantly pressuring teens to do well in school, acting like their whole life depends on a couple of numbers. I understand school is important but people overexaggerate the impact high school will have on your life. If people had told me this sooner, maybe I wouldn't have been so depressed and confused. 




 I have around 51 hours on terraria from a while back when I used to play a lot 




 HI! I played Terraria a while ago. I'm just getting back into it. If anyone wants to set up a brand new terraria server and create a new character to start fresh! I'd be glad to play with you. My steam name is theguyhiding! 




 OMG I reacted the same way back when I was 13!! 




 so the dick and balls penetrated both her eyes and mouth? 




 Well make a mercedes for the link skill, it's useful :D and mercedes are a fun class nonetheless. 




 Wind Archer or Mercedes! Wild Hunter is also pretty good and common right now.  




 Add me xDKnightzx1. I'm not exactly a low level but I'm willing to help you on some boss runs! 




 Aww that sucks :( I was hoping you guys would actually do a 180 and start dating each other. I like surprise happy endings like that hahaha. But people go their seperate ways and friendships do eventually erode. Nonetheless, I'm glad you seem both of you guys seem to be happy :D 




 Regardlessly, even if you didn't directly caused his suicide, you should still feel some guilt or at least some remorse for his death. While I understand that he was trying to hit on your girlfriend in front of you, you should've never said "go kill yourself". Those words especially could be the trigger for some people to actually committ suicide. You never know what they're feeling and what they're going through.  




 I liked the twist at the end :D. I wonder if you guys are friends now? Both of you seem to be on much friendlier terms. It's also cute to see how she developed a crush on you. Maybe you guys should go out sometime :) 




 I'm going through this right now. I just finished watching HxH 2011 and I don't know what to do with my life right now. The feeling of emptiness and nothingness is the worst part. Now I have to find another enjoyable anime to binge watch to take my mind off of things :(. I hate this endless vicious cycle... 




 Pitou would probably have to use Terpischora to break free but she can't because that requires Nen. I think Pitou even with her raw strength wouldn't be able break free of it. Youpi is physically strong but is he stronger than Uvogin? Keep in mind in terms of raw physical power Uvogin ranks the highest out of the whole Phantom Troupe and he even he was powerless against the Nen chains Kurapika conjured. 




 I'm not exactly sure if they would be able to break free of those Nen chains. Kurapika used it on Uvogin and he was struggling greatly and he didn't even manage to loosen the chains one bit. Also the chains I believe inhibits the person trapped from using Nen so that means the Royal Guards would have to use their innate physical strength. I think Kurapika at that point would have a good chance to defeat them. The harder part would actually be getting the chains onto them... 









 1. I remember watching the very first episode of HxH 2011 a few years ago, I didn't like it all that much so I put it aside. Fast forward to two months ago, I decided to restart it and I LOVED IT! My love for HxH particularly started around episode 3 when they started the actual first phase of the Hunter Exam.
2. The first episode may be a bit "underwhelming" and a bit like the typical shounen cliche especially with how Gon and his dream of becoming a hunter reminded me of Naruto's dream of becoming a Hokage lol. Then when the actual phases of the Hunter Exam started it was awesome and definitely not underwhelming anymore.
3. Shounen is probably my favorite genre or a close second since I also like Romance/Slice of Life animes too. HxH, I feel is an exception from most Shounen animes I've seen. The storytelling for one is much more fluent than the storytelling of other shounens. Also in HxH there isn't one character that seemed incredibly overpowered and strong like Goku in DBZ. (Maybe Mereum but Netero helped balanced it).
4. I found this show simply by scrolling through a list of popular animes on Crunchyroll.  




 Beautifully well done! I love the details you added to Alluka. Overall excellent sculpture!! May I ask how long sculpting the whole thing took? 




 Applicable to women: "How much do you weigh?" 




 Hisoka might be overhyped just a bit tho
 




 LOL Niagara Falls coming out of Hisokas pants 




 Nice explanation! That's what I was thinking before too :D! 




 fight her as a team
 




 This is assuming all of them used their full strength. 




 I'm looking to start fresh on a new server, maybe on Windia, after I level my Dark Knight to 200. We can play together if you'd like :D 









 You could send me a 10k nx code if you'd like also :D. I could use some extra character slots too! 




 I really like your example of the Butterfly Effect! It reminded me a lot of the anime, Steins;Gate.  




 Said no one ever.
 




 I have a few questions. What map in BH do you use as a training area? My Dark Knight is lvl 195, would it still give good exp? 




 Does Black Heaven really give good exp? 














 Amidst all the sexual NSFW stories other people posted, your post is the only one that doesn't contain the word "sex" or "masturbate" in it. Good job!! 




 500 Days of Summer!!! 




 ITT: Crazy Yuno Gasai girls 




 The SAT Blue Book 




 OMG they killed Kenny! You bastards!!! 




 OMG MY EXACT THOUGHTS!! 




 Yeah! I'm interested, I'm on scania though... 




 Yeah he's a pretty decent president, definitely not completely terrible but not revolutionary either. People just like to blame him for everything since they can't blame it on any other politician.  




 Ah, that makes sense! On a side note, I hope Gon finds his dad sometime soon! 




 I see, thanks!
 




 Yes I'm looking forward to seeing more of this arc! I liked the Yorknew City Arc as well. Another question, what happened to Chrollo? Why didn't he return back to the Phantom Troupe? I know Kurapika put that chain around his heart but other than that what's stopping him from going back to the Troupe? 




 I just got up to the Greed Island Arc and I don't quite understand the rules? Do you leave the island when you collect the 100 cards that are part of the restricted card slots inside the book? 




 Probably going to be buried but oh well...

I've been friends with my best friend since I was in 3rd grade. What brought us together was our shared interest in video games and the fact that we're pratically neighbors. While we're still friends, we don't have the same camaraderie that we shared years ago. Since high school we went sort of on our own separate ways. He hangs out with other people and he spends more time with his girlfriend than with me. Looking back, that was one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced. Seeing the distance grow between you and your best friend is utterly terrible, especially knowing that no matter how hard you try, your relationship with him won't ever be the same. But thats part of life and it's one of the few things I've managed to come to terms with.
