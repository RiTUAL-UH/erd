 Yeah... I didn't want to ever have to ask this question, but how do you keep going when you feel like there's nothing to keep going for? It's not that I'm actually alone, I have an amazing boyfriend, a great group of friends, etc. It's just this awful feeling that it's all going to be taken away from me.

What started this depressive episode is my boyfriend texting me, saying 'I'm so fucking tired of everything this world has to offer" and then telling me to forget about it, and that he'll "be fine" I know him, and know he wont be fine. 

This is making me worry, which is something I do way too much. I worry about impending doom, how much I weight (to the point where my food intake is being monitored because I don't eat "enough"), my friends' happiness, being late to things, the things that go on while I sleep, etc. My mind is constantly going at 500 mph, and I can't keep up. It's a horrible existence, really. 

I have so much pressure on me to be something, to be the only person in my family to never get arrested, go to college, get a good job, make good money, etc. I used to be a star student and that was where I got my self worth. now, my grades are falling and so is my self worth. I feel like if I'm not my family's trophy child then there is no reason to be their child at all, that I'm just a disappointment. 

I cut. A lot. My mom made me go to a psychiatrist because of it. After practically interrogating me for a few hours, they got to the touchy subject I hate talking about- rape. I was raped as a child repeatedly by a cousin not too much older than me. Honestly, being raped didn't make me feel mad at him, I feel mad at myself for not saying no. I feel mad at myself for not stopping him. I feel mad at myself for not screaming at the top of my lungs. I feel... Used. Anyways, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, and Clinical Depression. They thought that the best thing to do for m was prescribe me an antidepressant. It worked amazingly at first, but after a while,I began to feel like a zombie. As if I was an empty shell. As if I had no control over my mind. I take the pill sporadically, but for the most part, I don't. 

Honestly, at this point, I feel like my life is going nowhere, and that theres no point in trying anymore. I was never pretty, I was never talented, hell, I'm not even a virgin and I'm 13, but I was smart and going places. Now... Now I'm just nothing.

Why do I feel so lost? Why do I feel like such a failure? Should I go back on my medication? 




 Alright, so I hang out with a group of people containing all the "weird" kids from my school. We wear a lot of black, cause, ya know, it's the color of our souls. Anyhow, my boyfriend is amongst this group, and lately he has been very depressed. This caused a domino effect, which even caused one of my best friend's parents to find out about her self harming problem and homeschool her. Honestly, I feel like when one of us falls, we all fall... And shatter into a million pieces on the hard ground below. 

Long story short, I need answers to these three questions...

Do you think that us hanging out together is self destructive?
How can I try and help my friends?
How do I keep it together myself when surrounded by sadness? 




 Alright, so my boyfriend and I have been together for a while. We're teenagers so we can't really do anything super sexy or romantic on Valentine's day, but we both have a love for the arts. Writing, music, drawing, etc. What are some ideas as to something I could make for him? I was considering writing a super cheesy song for him or something like that. 




 We all went into the counselor's office today crying. Him, our friends, me. I'm looking more for ways to cheer him up.  




 I feel like you need to seek help. Not necessarily medication, but definitely some counseling.  




 I'm 13. He's 14, let's call him Shmer. We've been very close since I met him, and after being best friends for a very long time, we ended up together. Our relationship is very different from most people our age's. We have a very strong, emotional connection, and we don't rush things. We've been going out for 2 moths, and are not very physical. We can tell each other anything and everything, and know each other's deepest and darkest secrets. 

His  dad is insane. Not necessarily straight out abusive, but he is very mean to him. He doesn't accept him for who he is. He wants Shmer to be a trophy father's trophy son, and thats just not who he is. He found out that Shmer has been having some self harm problems and can't even look him in the eye anymore and says he has to go lie with his mom. Honestly, he's not very happy in either of those houses. I know I can't do much, but, I want to help.

Usually, he is my rock. He is the one I lean on, the one that takes care of me.Now, I want him to be able to lean on me, but I don't know how to be happy myself, that way I can focus on him. Honestly, the rest of our friends and I just broke down today because we were so worried about him, and what he might do. How can I make him feel a bit happier? I see him everyday at school. I text him whenever I can (when he has his phone). Are there any little things I can do here and there to make him feel better?

i just... I don't know how to handle seeing him hurting. It breaks my heart. He helps everyone else, but wont let anyone help him.  
























 I have great friends, an amazing boyfriend, all that jazz. It doesn't matter, I still feel lonely. They all care about me and love me, yet, I still feel so isolated from everyone. I hate this. I absolutely hate it. I'm a teenager, I'm supposed to be having the time of my life, not trapped inside my room wondering if they mean it when they say "I love you." 




 I cut. Today in PE a very bad cut started bleeding again. I got it to stop bleeding, but not without a few girls seeing. Someone went to the office and told them about my situation. When I was called into the counselor's office, I wasn't scared. I'm there quite often because I happen t hang out with all the self harming and suicidal kids at my school, along with my boyfriend. Until they told me what someone had said. I denied it all, but it didn't stop them from calling my mom... And CPS. When I got in the car, she wasn't mad, but she said I need to "work on myself" so now I am only allowed to have my phone one hour a night on weekdays,  four hours on weekends for a month. Usually, this wouldn't be big deal, but lately I have been going through a whole ton of shit that I don't want to talk about with anyone but two certain people, and now I really cant.

How do I deal with this? 




 I know, I know. It just was a spur of the moment.  




 I'm a freshman 









 I have done that so many times. Eventually, I stopped being cautious. When out with friends, I'm known as the "dare devil" because if I see a car coming, I don't move. If there is a bridge, I walk on the railing, hoping I fall off.  
























 Alright, so we've been together for a long time. I'm not having anxiety because of a trust issue or anything like that. I don't really know why I'm having anxiety. The message he sent me wasn't passive aggressive or anything he just said "Hi I can't talk at all today and I'm sorry. I love you. So, so, so much. Have a great day beautiful." I already knew he had stuff to do today, and I thought that to talking to and/or seeing him would be something I could deal with for at least one day, since when he's at his dad's, I have to deal with it for a week or more. It's snowing. I'm stuck at home all day so I don't have a distraction. I realize that I can't be so dependent on him, and that he has his own life, but my anxiety is pretty bad. How do I stop freaking out and get him off my mind? 




 I have severe anxiety, and I'm only thirteen. 've had it since I was seven due to some unfortunate events; it basically stole part of my childhood from me

See, my best friend who I love more than anyone, is at his dad's. His dad is a it of a douche so, that means I can't talk to him until very late at night and only some nights. It is a three day weekend, so I haven't seen him since we went out to eat after school on Thursday. He texts me sporadically, and I text him back. I usually get no response until much later, which for most people would be understandable, but having anxiety, I flip the hell out. I get kinda shaky, withdrawn, etc. This is an awful way to spend an otherwise glorious weekend. Any advice on how to calm down? 




 okay, so, in highschool, the two middle schools in my district are combined. The lunches don't go by grade, they're usually just random. I'm like crying and shaking right now because the idea of not being with my friends is scaring me. Not knowing anyone scares me, and I don't make friends very easily. At all. People say I have this "magnetic personality" but new people terrify me. Is there any possibility my psychiatrist could persuade the school to give me lunch with some people I know? Because if not I know damn well I will have anxiety attacks constantly, I'm probably not gonna have any classes with my friends since we're all on different levels anyway. Not having lunch is just too heavy.  




 I do the same exact thing,hoping it will spark real tears.  




 That's what I'm on now.. Did you notice it starting to just worsen your depression after a period of time? 




 Did the antidepressant happen to be lexapro?  
























 I've surrounded myself with people who have mental illnesses and broken families. I don't know why, but I find it comforting. If you ever need to talk,I'm around. And I swear I'm not a creepy guy sitting in a basement 0.0  




 Okay, my mom had me at the ripe ol' age of 16. I had a lot of hard times in my life because of that, so I have to ask, why not out your children up for adoption? I would have asked to be put up for adoption if I had any sense of what was going on when I was a newborn, and I know it would have been the better choice. So, why not? Am I just generalizing my experiences? 




 I'm a number 6...


SIXES FOR THE WORLD! 




 I feel like I'm the only one outside of my friend group at school, sometimes, which sucks. It'd be nice to know that there are other people my age who have these problems.  




 Yes, I do. Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but mostly social anxiety. 

Usually, hanging out and talking to him works, but, as I said, I can't today. What people don't usually get is that he was my best friend before we were together so I've always depended on him, ever since we were really little.  




 I have an anxiety disorder, so my being upset could be for many reasons, or no reason at all.
