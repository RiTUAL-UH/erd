 teeth gritting? 




 With the facial hair and the kind eyes you're definitely my type!! You're very handsome, 8/10 




 Brash but truthfully, thank you i appreciate that. I don't think i'm ugly so to speak, but there are definitely features that I would consider ugly and sometimes they're all I can see so it brings me down.
That's what it comes down to I think. My boyfriend always calls me pretty truly he does like any good boyfriend would! But i'm a woman and subsequently tend to be too hard on myself.. 




 And i take that as a huge compliment haha. I'm really flattered thank you :) 




 Actually, regal is a really cool way to put it. I honestly never thought of it that way 




 i must say, well phrased! thank you! 




 i may be somewhat biased because i absolutely LOVE facial hair, but i really do think it suits you quite well! I would keep it, you have the kind of look that needs a nice manly beard. Not enough me grow em these days! wear it proud :) 




 finally a numbered rate! thank you. As for my bulldog bite it is definitely there, it's receded to the point that is a few milimetres past my top jaw. Even with that though it shouldn't be past my top jaw at all so it still makes me fee; self conscious. Love to hear that it's not noticeable though so thank you :) 




 Keep the facial hair, really suits you and looks great on men in general! 




 Thank you, perhaps i have anxiety over looking different from the norm. There's always that "typical" pretty and i think just about every girl is looking for it aha. 




 I am a mix of German and English, half and half. Could that have anything to do with my jaw line? I live in Canada if that provides any context aswell haha. But thank you, didn't know there was a genetic line behind the trait! But i could have assumed.. 




 hahahaha. Thank you ;) 




 They do seem to be common and I have always wasted one, but that is the way I should be looking at it i suppose. My jaw gives me a very round/oval face and I have mixed feelings about that. But thank you a lot it's reassuring to receive comments like this! :) 




 Thanks! I grew up with a reeeally bad under bite, but i was lucky to have it recede on it's own to the point that it's only a few millimeters past my upper teeth. It's at the point that I wouldn't bother with the jaw correction surgery but it's still noticeable enough to bother me!  




 Thank you for the comment! He's my boyfriend of a year so he's not too difficult to attract haha. honestly I've just always been jealous pretty girls with cute pointy little chins! I don't have that but i think it's adorable. 
























 Everyone here complains about being lonely, but they resent seeing people happy and in a relationship anyways! 




 what's that?
 




 actually safest with him :) 














 I have this one outfit with a hood and an awesome bra that makes me look like a monster haha! But it's winter in Canada and it's cold now so i can't wear tutu's and stuff, I actually need shorts. 




 These are awesome!! haha :) I love seeing themes! I honestly never get pictures when i'm at raves, I do nothing but dance and glove, so this time I got a picture before i went! i'm jealous you have such an awesome pic durring the event! 




 thanks for defending me! You understood exactly. I didn't claim it was original and I know others dress similarly because it's a pretty typical attire at raves now, but I still think it can be made into a lot of fun and creativity. You can't see it in the picture but i'm also wearing a homemade mask and light up bow. So it's crafting too!  




 I invite anyone to post their costumes below!!! I love seeing new ideas! 









 A quick, to the point answer. Something I appreciate :) thanks! that's pretty cool 









 I think overbites are cute for some reason! But Olivia Wilde is a good example. Maybe i have less to worry about than i previously assumed haha 




 You look better without them, it draws the attention to your eyes which are very nice :) 




 well that's my smile so.... bummer. 
























 I wasn't planning on doing any red. I did plan on some orange but I decided against it because of a background i may put on it in the future 




 Thanks! :) like I said im really indecisive about it right now which is why im waiting to make a decision. 




 I changed my mind! I decided im going to add more the the background on the piece, likely some blue/pink/orange tropical flowers. So its actually going to be a larger piece now rather than just the bird on its own. Perhaps. Not truly decided yet which is why im waiting! 




 Thanks! Her name is Lisa dowling she works from her home in the GTA. She's been tattooing for 20+ years so I really trust her with my pieces! 









 My next sit is February 6th, so i'll post one soon enough! :) i actually found it to be the most painful of any of my tattoos, i have 3 others which are all black and white, this is my first colour piece. I found the most painful spots we're the top of the wings near my butt and the back portion of the bird. But definitely the wings were the worst.

Considering it is the largest piece i've had and also the longest sit at 3.5 hours i feel that was part of the reason it began to hurt quite a bit. It's also a lot of shading and colouring in one spot, but definitely a sensitive area to get a large piece like this 




 When my tattoo artist was positioning it she was actually talking about how important it is that the lines follow your natural curve. I agree with her, if not it makes your body look off. Im really stoked she played good attention to positioning! 




 She doesn't, she has a group on facebook but I believe it's closed now and only previous clients can view it. She hard to get! The wait right now is about 6 months... PM me and I'll see what we can do! Btw hi from Whitby as well :) 




 She used to work at sinful inflictions in Whitby but ended up getting a great client base and left to work from her home! She now has a studio in her house, fully licensed and whatnot. 




 Yeah I found it originally as a chalk drawing and loved it! Searched up the artist and saw the blurb and then was of course sure to switch it up and give my artist her own personal freedom on the piece. It translated into a tattoo really well! 




 Im thinking orange and some mauve as well. Like a tropical colour theme 




 thank you! I gave her the basic idea and said to get creative with it and she honestly hit it out of the park! It looks like a pastel/watercolour which I find really amazing. 




 Thanks! On the next sit she'll be adding some orange into the blank areas and colouring the tail feathers. Im also considering adding some drop shadowing, but im not sure yet. 









 How come a girl can't just like a hairy man? i hate the concept of manscaping, i think men are meant to be hairy and i don't expect him to remove his natural growth! 
























 Yeah thats the chalk drawing I saw of it first as inspiration. I then looked up the artist and found her deviant art page, read up on it and said she'd like it changed around for a tattoo. So as you can see I actually switched it up quite a bit with my tattooist.  




 Oops sorry!! I didn't realize this was risque in the traditional sense. I'll watch for that next time, thanks for the kind warning :) 




 The direction you're stepping in is outrageous for a first tattoo!! Firstly yes it would be very painful, the area around your eyes is thinly covered by skin and you would be tattooing right over bone which is the most painful.

But what you SHOULD be concerned about is the finality of tattooing your face. Tattoos are forever and your face is YOU, and how the world perceives YOU. there are a ton of things you have to consider before getting anything done neck up. Jobs, dating, social standing, acceptance of the people around you, and dealing with how people will inevitably judge you in a matter of seconds. It will reshape your life by having a facial tattoo, and this is what you really should be considering, not the pain level!

The fact that you're considering something this drastic for a first go based off of fantasy art on LOL makes me think that you're not ready for your first piece of ink. Dont do it! 




 It's covered haha so no fear here! 




 No no no lisa did not copy it, that was my original inspiration that I brought to her, but as the blurb on the bottom says I had it changed around quite a bit (colours, dimension, style) before tattooing it. Remember that i came to lisa with the idea, she didnt copy the bird because I asked for a quetzal 




 As I said previously, inspired more than anything because I still chose to change things for personal taste since it is my permanent decision. I was mostly inspired by their tail feathers and then afterwards the story. I gave my artist the basis and what I liked/didn't like and this is what we created :) 




 Haha I like that! That's exactly how im going to think of it now :) 




 Oh wow I had no idea that's a really cool story! I was aware the green had to do with flourishing crops but I hadn't realized the story behind the red belly. Being that it's yellow it's realistic that I could add a strong colour like red on top of it. But honestly I find red to be such a strong colour and it illicits ill feelings from me for some reason. 

Kind of overwhelms me, I think because my grandparents LOVED red and everything was red red red. They had these thick red curtains that blocked out all the light in the room I'd sleep in when visiting, and once I couldn't find my way out of the room because it was dark. I started crying and my mom ran in and turned on the lights and it was red everywhere and I just hated it after that haha. Kind of ridiculous what sticks with you from childhood. 




 It's your national bird right? And traditionally yes it should, but as you can see this isn't traditional in the strictest sense, its more so inspired by a quetzal and left to some interpretation from my artist. I kept the green because it's my absolute favourite colour and 70% of the bird is green, but I wanted to play with the other colours a bit. I'm not a huge fan of red either (surrounded by it as a kid) so that was the first colour I bumped. 




 I really like this. I like to think of it as "one blind, and one able to see", it's a nice contrast and kind of an artist way to interpret this. 




 In the GTA, Whitby Ontario. She's amazing but oddly enough she doesnt promote herself much! Just has a private group on facebook that im lucky enough to be a part of. She's really humble and has a loyal client base all by word of mouth. 

Recently she was featured as a great Canadian artist in a magazine and I was so happy for her because she never asks for recognition. 




 Wow quite the compliment! Thank you I appreciate that :) 




 Well this is definitely the place to be! Just make sure you switch yours up a bit and allow the artist some creative freedom once you decide on a basic design. You'll like it more once you make it unique to your tastes! 




 Thank you! I'd like to see it! Pm me a pic of it :) 




 Well firstly it is a beautifully coloured bird and a very feminine image to have on my body (even though this image is based on the male) which is what initially caught my eye. 

But also after looking into it, and as someone touched on previously by mentioning quetzalcoatl, the quetzal was viewed by the Mayans as the god of the air and believed to bring light and goodness to the people. I just really like the meaning behind that and what it once meant to an ancient culture.
