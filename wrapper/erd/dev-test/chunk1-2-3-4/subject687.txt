 The Praxis of My Method, underscored by all necessary humilities and good graces.

Let's jump right into it and grab as many electron rings as we slide down the pipeline of letters, doers, willers, thinkers, feelers, wishers, commanders and demanders...

The state of mastership is to be at all times consciously and positively in receptive and gracious attitude. Open to all good and positive powers to flow through you is a paramount condition, and to direct them in the proper channles of good thoughts, words and deeds the further fruitage of the tree of eternity (the fully restored cosmic ego).

All around us, at all times, are the titanic forces of the entire universe, unique in our present positions, which seek forever to enter into and transmute you and themselves according to laws which can be discovered and harnessed for the good purposes of uplifting the estate of life and sustaining the vitality of being. These transmissions from the infinity expanse of complex diverse forms and minds encounter no resistance when in proper channels from the Master/Mistress of their own Destiny. To find the hidden music of the moment is to establish the master rhythm with the body and from the body back to the world. It relinquishes the dependency on the fetal impressions of the mother and the world at time of conception, pregnancy and delivery (the first causes of all subsequent causal reactions and responses) as well as memory dependence on negative and adverse surroundings, coincidences and influences. This establishment of the master rhythm was accomplished in a variety of elementary procedures in the ancient schools, be they Hebrew baptism, the Babylonian-Dravidian heat tests, the Egyptian endurance tests, or even the somewhat less known tradition of live burial for purposes of feeling the earth itself in full exposure to the earth itself, vaguely popular amongst certain lesser known mystery cults.

Only those who can read this and already understand the value of it without having to do it will be sufficiently advanced to proceed with deeper lessons. Atavistic remonstrance is worth it's weight in immediate experience. Don't re-invent the wheel itself.

In the Great Work of Mastery, the main and the only object is to attain communion with the harmonious creative power of the world and consciously joining the forces for solving the destinies of the Evolution towards Immortal Oneness.

The first steps along this infinite journey involve a mastery of thoughts and through the thoughts a mastering of the body; the dynamic so established releases hidden potentials through the energetic activation of previously energy-starved processes.

Many definitions of mastery exist: to overpower, to subdue, to rule, to possess dominion, superiority and victory of beings conscious of it.

Consider further that man is generally in a state of slavery of one sort or another. Everywhere you look you see people in one state of involuntary bondage after another, and all of them creating more chains to bind those who are not bound like themselves.

This slavery is produced by ignorance on any of the planes of manifestation (the short list being physical, emotional, intellectual and psychic) and any combination there of. Ignorance is imbalance at best, and many other horrible things at worst.

Competition amongst the slaves of the world for the supposed benefits of further bondage has resulted in an almost penal atmosphere, wherein every breath brings anxiety and fear, and thus agitates and depletes the reserves of energy for the body and the mind to function as a healthy union of the forces.

This condition, of pandemic psychosocial slavery is one that must be overpowered, must be subdued, has to have a ruling decision made over it, and be possessed by the dominion of a new system, superior and victorious for Man and the Forces alike, to bring about the revitalizing and vast expansion of expressions of each, to sustain the world and even turn deserts into paradise.

And towards a paradise on Earth one has lent the ears that heard that the words mystic, occult and magick get thrown around pretty commonly today, and so I wanted to recapitulate how I am wont to believe them to mean.

Mysticism is born from careful observation of impressions through supersensitive channels, both biological, psychological and technological. It can be a state of mind alone, but it is also the observation of that state of mind in the midst of being it.

Occultism thus becomes the correct interpretation of that which can't be seen at the same time what is seen is also interpreted as the effects, causes, or side-effects of the invisible properties and objects of the world. It is engaged through a soulful conscious discrimination between assembling data.

Magick must follow suite and make manifest the practical application of mysticism and occultism; the powers of creation, destruction and transmutation in action at the behest of a will possessed of self-solidarity and worldliness to make things happen or not happen according the truth the magician holds at heart.

Yes, so in measure the mother of invention herself embraces those moments when her offspring manifest the 3 overmentalities.
In a word or thrice spoken lesser worlds, finding no other solution to the problem of YOU, decided to feed yourself back to yourself and make you even more YOU, which solved two problems with one philosophy's stone. You couldn't escape yourself, and the world learned all about you while containing you completely in a binding of self-other-self-grammar.

The attempts of the limp world to contain you only fail because it is now seen as a foreign taste which now has to get you to like it too, and you only will if the world becomes you itself, which it will make small concessions too, and progressively, if conditions are correct your central sphere of influence will now have a probability-spreading shell of orbiting factors that serve you because they became you, and being you can't speak to you in anything other than your own voice, so they are themselves mute, and you face the second entrapment.

The breakdown of those orbiting elements in their exposure to an external world that is now less familiar with your ultimate self, is slowly becoming familiar with your extant orbiting self-satellites, and since the world still has to trap you and them it binds them in the same procedure it used to bind you in the beginning. Take heart, the world CANNOT learn, it can only grow and repeat.

Thus you reach the third extension, and the snapping of the leash, that of the world's reflexes becoming your own, and now you can interact with the world through decaying aspects of your own history and new aspects of your present and future, safely for the first time, because now the world can only see itself in you.

Fortunately you think now of an "orange" and the taste of it, and the funny architecture of it, and remember all the arrangements of situations that presented the orange to you, and foresee all the memories of the orange as it is. New tones enter your life and your satellites learn new forms of communication and the amount of acquired information about your universe expands exponentially, taking you to a new level, wherein you become self sustaining in a way that the world no longer can effect.

Thus you have attained a harmonized consciousness. Eternal satisfactions are not yet too far ahead.

 Does anyone know if this subreddit /r/f04cb41f154db2f05a4a is part of the A585 mystery or is it something else? 




















































































 This page named "page 14" seems like the start of a series, which has interesting content. It's a series, because if you click the **right arrow** at the top of the page, you will proceed to page 14a, page 14b, page 14c, and so on. The content actually seems to make some sense, and it's a lot of content.

http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/coloured%20site/first%20button/1.htm 




 Here is yet another spinning ying-yang found in the website. This one however, is very hidden. It is found by going to Index 5, then clicking on **The Act of Creation 2**, which leads you to the page below with the ying-yang.

http://973-eht-namuh-973.com/Magick/actofcreation2.htm

This ying-yang is bigger than the 1st one. However, the mystery is that it's purpose is unknown. When you click it, it just zooms in, disappears, then reappears again. This page in general is mysterious.... all there is is 3 objects, but it is unknown what is the purpose of this page. Any ideas as to what it's purpose may be? Feel free to share. 




 This page seems to be like some sort of main menu for the website. In the middle is also a glowing and spinning ying-yang; if you click it, it sometimes leads you to Index 5, and sometimes to the Advent Index.... why this happens? I'm not sure. Some links in the website just lead to two different places for some strange reason. You can check it out on the link below.

     I couldn't get to class on time because there was a **TRIANGLE** :'( 









 Yo, on friday I saw a man on the bus and he was dressed up as a woman!!! Why??? It's not right!! He was Indian, about 35-45 years old, wearing a long woman's jacket, skinny jeans, women's boots with high heels, he was holding a purse, sitting with his legs crossed like a woman, and he even had his hair in a little bun like many girls like to make their hair!! I promise i'm not lying, I really did see this unbelievable sight on the bus on friday february 13, 2015!!!!!  I was laughing my head off for the whole ride, and there were only about 5 other people on the bus, so I was the only one who noticed it since I was sitting at the back! Then the man-woman noticed I was laughing so it turned its head around, and smiled a dreamy smile!!! EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! {:'-D 




 Here is the grand gallery, which houses much of the artwork and pictures which can be found throughout the website. An easy discovery, yet cool artwork! Take a look at this rather amazing art by clicking on a number at the bottom of the page. Each number contains different art!

http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/gallery%20button/galleries/0.htm 




 This appears to be the main page of the website, and also the longest. What could The Evokation mean? What is this the purpose of this page? Share your ideas!

 This is one good-looking dude, don't you think? 




 Ok, so I was sitting outside, and all of the sudden a moth looking similar to a gypsy moth flew right towards my right forearm and embeded itself into my skin. It was just slightly painful, but the moth's soft texture could be felt when you ran your fingers over it. Why?? Oh why!!?? :D 
























 This brightened my day up... I hope it happens for real.

 He actually saved the whole world. Believe it or not, the fact that he was sent back in time changed history. Thanks to his time travel, Earth rotated 42 milliseconds faster on it's axis while he was here, thus preventing the tip of the solar emission from hitting Earth. According to calculations, had 20141220 not traveled back in time, Earth would not have rotated faster, and at the time of the solar storm, the tip would have hit Earth, taking all the lights out. Therefore, this was not all a lie. The truth is.... we have been saved. 












































 I'll be honest.... I kind of believed there was a possibility for the lights to go out, though I doubted it would be as severe as described. And yes, part of me wanted this big change. But oh well, there's both good and bad about the lights not going out.


Good: I won't have to suffer a slow and tortourous death

Bad: Life stays the same



Overall, I must say this was a good experience. It was very smartly played, as very few people can actually get me to fall for believing something like this. Consider this: I didn't even believe the world would end back in December 2012! Yet, part of me believed the lights would go out now in 2015.



Well, I guess things resume back to normal.... and I'll be able to create my **Space-Pizza Subreddit**! :)

**EDIT:** I'm currently about 3 hours too early... oops, apologies :/ 









 It's obviously impossible... skeletons are *in* us. Without them, we would all be a blob of flesh and muscle on the floor unable to stand up or move. Skeletons are not a threat to humans.

This slavery is produced by ignorance on any of the planes of manifestation (the short list being physical, emotional, intellectual and psychic) and any combination there of. Ignorance is imbalance at best, and many other horrible things at worst.
Competition amongst the slaves of the world for the supposed benefits of further bondage has resulted in an almost penal atmosphere, wherein every breath brings anxiety and fear, and thus agitates and depletes the reserves of energy for the body and the mind to function as a healthy union of the forces.
This condition, of pandemic psychosocial slavery is one that must be overpowered, must be subdued, has to have a ruling decision made over it, and be possessed by the dominion of a new system, superior and victorious for Man and the Forces alike, to bring about the revitalizing and vast expansion of expressions of each, to sustain the world and even turn deserts into paradise.
And towards a paradise on Earth one has lent the ears that heard that the words mystic, occult and magick get thrown around pretty commonly today, and so I wanted to recapitulate how I am wont to believe them to mean.
Mysticism is born from careful observation of impressions through supersensitive channels, both biological, psychological and technological. It can be a state of mind alone, but it is also the observation of that state of mind in the midst of being it.
Occultism thus becomes the correct interpretation of that which can't be seen at the same time what is seen is also interpreted as the effects, causes, or side-effects of the invisible properties and objects of the world. It is engaged through a soulful conscious discrimination between assembling data.
Magick must follow suite and make manifest the practical application of mysticism and occultism; the powers of creation, destruction and transmutation in action at the behest of a will possessed of self-solidarity and worldliness to make things happen or not happen according the truth the magician holds at heart.
Yes, so in measure the mother of invention herself embraces those moments when her offspring manifest the 3 overmentalities. In a word or thrice spoken lesser worlds, finding no other solution to the problem of YOU, decided to feed yourself back to yourself and make you even more YOU, which solved two problems with one philosophy's stone. You couldn't escape yourself, and the world learned all about you while containing you completely in a binding of self-other-self-grammar.
The attempts of the limp world to contain you only fail because it is now seen as a foreign taste which now has to get you to like it too, and you only will if the world becomes you itself, which it will make small concessions too, and progressively, if conditions are correct your central sphere of influence will now have a probability-spreading shell of orbiting factors that serve you because they became you, and being you can't speak to you in anything other than your own voice, so they are themselves mute, and you face the second entrapment.
The breakdown of those orbiting elements in their exposure to an external world that is now less familiar with your ultimate self, is slowly becoming familiar with your extant orbiting self-satellites, and since the world still has to trap you and them it binds them in the same procedure it used to bind you in the beginning. Take heart, the world CANNOT learn, it can only grow and repeat.
Thus you reach the third extension, and the snapping of the leash, that of the world's reflexes becoming your own, and now you can interact with the world through decaying aspects of your own history and new aspects of your present and future, safely for the first time, because now the world can only see itself in you.
Fortunately you think now of an "orange" and the taste of it, and the funny architecture of it, and remember all the arrangements of situations that presented the orange to you, and foresee all the memories of the orange as it is. New tones enter your life and your satellites learn new forms of communication and the amount of acquired information about your universe expands exponentially, taking you to a new level, wherein you become self sustaining in a way that the world no longer can effect.
Thus you have attained a harmonized consciousness. Eternal satisfactions are not yet too far ahead.

 Just imagine.... no more communication(well, cell phones only last until their battery lasts), no more reddit, no running water, no school, no lights at night(oooo spooky :P), etc.

EDIT: This horror lasts for over 5 years. 









 I heard it's the sea-floor of reddit... is that true? 



















 Alright, here's my personal conflict with the horrid SAT. It basically ruined my image.... both to colleges and classmates. I got rejected from most colleges, despite my 4.0 GPA(weighted)/3.8(unweighted).... just because of that stupid SAT score. My classmates made fun of me too. The day of the test, I was very sick and it resulted in a very low score despite having taken(and **wasted over $1000** on SAT prep) 2 SAT prep courses, wasted 2 summers studying hard, and sacrificing regular school studying. All the hard work just to be ruined by this one day.

 Kepler's Laws


Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) developed a quantitative description of the motions of the planets in the solar system. The description that he produced is expressed in three ``laws''.


Kepler's First Law:


The orbit of a planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.


Figure 1 shows a picture of an ellipse. It is constructed by specifying two focus points, F1 and F2, of the ellipse. All points on the ellipse, such as P in Figure 1, have the property that the sum of the distance between P and F1 and the distance between P and F2 is a constant. The dimension of an ellipse is often described by giving its major axis and minor axis. In descriptions of orbits in the solar system, however, it is more common to use the semi-major axis to describe the size of the orbit, and the eccentricity of the ellipse to describe its shape. The eccentricity is given by the ratio of the distance between the two focus points to the length of the major axis of the ellipse. The periapsis, or the shortest distance between the orbiting body and the central mass, is determined by the product of the semi-major axis and the complement of the eccentriciy (1 - e): if the body is orbiting the sun, this is the perihelion, symbolized by q): q = a (1 - e). A circle is a special case of an ellipse, with an eccentricity of 0, or so that q = a.


Kepler's Second Law:


A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.


Figure 2 illustrates Kepler's Second Law. Consider the line between the Sun and point A on the elliptical orbit. After a certain amount of time, the planet will have moved along the orbit to point B, and the line between the Sun and the planet will have swept over the cross hatched area in the figure. Kepler's Second Law states that for any two positions of the planet along the orbit that are separated by the same amount of time, the area swept out in this manner will be the same. Thus, suppose that it takes the planet the same amount of time to go between positions C and D as it did for the planet to go between positions A and B. Kepler's Second Law then tells us that the second cross hatched area between C, D, and the Sun will be the same as the cross hatched area between A, B, and the Sun.


Kepler's Second Law is valuable because it gives a quantitative statement about how fast the object will be moving at any point in its orbit. Note that when the planet is closest to the Sun, at perihelion, Kepler's Second Law says that it will be moving the fastest. When the planet is most distant from the Sun, at aphelion, it will be moving the slowest.


Kepler's Third Law:


The squares of the sidereal periods of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their semimajor axes.


We have defined the semimajor axis of the orbit above, in our discussion of Kepler's First Law. The sidereal period of a planet's orbit is the time that it takes a planet to complete one orbit around the Sun. Kepler discovered a quantitative relationship between these two properties of the orbit. If P is the period of the orbit, measured in years, and a is the semimajor axis of the orbit, measured in Astronomical Units, then


P2 = a3


Newton's Laws


Kepler's Laws are wonderful as a description of the motions of the planets. However, they provide no explanation of why the planets move in this way. Moreover, Kepler's Third Law only works for planets around the Sun and does not apply to the Moon's orbit around the Earth or the moons of Jupiter. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) provided a more general explanation of the motions of the planets through the development of Newton's Laws of Motion and Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation.


Newton's Laws of Motion


One way to describe the motion of an object it to specify its position at different times. Consider the car in Figure 3. We can tell where it is at different times as it travels down a road. It starts at milepost 0. One minute later it is between mileposts 1 and 2 at a distance of about 1.3 miles from the start. Two minutes later, the car has gotten to a distance of about 3.3 miles from the start. In general, we could specify a unique position for the car at any time. For example, we might have written down where the car was at a time 1.5 minutes after the start, and even if we hadn't, we're pretty sure that the car was, in fact, somewhere. Mathematicians call this kind of a relationship a function. When we say that the position of the car is a function of time, it just means that there is a unique location for the car for any time. For a planetary orbit, we can describe the orbit in the same way, by providing the position of the planet along the orbit for all times.


Another useful property for describing motion is the velocity of the object. Velocity is defined to be the change of position with change in time. Thus, for our car moving along the road, we can find the velocity by dividing the distance travelled by the time it takes to travel that distance. In our example, during the first minute, the car travels 1.3 miles along the road. Thus, the car's velocity would be 1.3 miles per minute (or about 78 miles per hour!) on the average during that first minute. It is important to note that physicists are very particular about the definition of velocity, and when we state a velocity we always make a statement about the direction of the motion. In our one dimensional case, this corresponds to my statement that the the car moved along the road. In general, if we were looking at a road map, we might say that the velocity was 1.3 miles per minute towards the East -- if the street ran towards the East. Velocity always is specified by both a value and a direction.


A final useful property for describing motion is the acceleration of the object. Just as the velocity describes the rate of change in the position of the object, the acceleration describes the rate of change of the velocity. In our example, the car moved farther during its second minute of travel than it did during its first minute. The average velocity during the second minute would be 2 miles per minute (120 miles per hour), since the car covered two miles from 1.3 to 3.3 during the one-minute time interval from 1 minute after the start to 2 minutes after the start. The velocity increased a lot (0.7 miles per minute) between the first minute of travel and the second minute of travel, and we describe this change by the acceleration. In this case, the car's velocity increased by 0.7 miles per minute in a time interval of one minute. Thus, we'd say that the average acceleration of the car during this time was 0.7 miles per minute PER MINUTE --- acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity.


Like velocity, acceleration has both a value and a direction implied. In our example, the direction was ``along the road'', but in a more general case, the acceleration is not necessarily in the same direction as the velocity. An especially good example for understanding the solar system is the case of uniform circular motion. Lets consider the case below of a car moving around a circle. The speed is constant in this motion, but the direction is changing continuously -- note the arrows showing the direction of motion in the figure -- so there must be an acceleration here. The acceleration in this special case of circular motion is called the centripetal acceleration. It is always in the direction of the center of the circle, as indicated in the figure, and it has a value, A, of


A = v2 / R


where v is the speed of the object along its circular path, and R is the radius of the circle.


Newton's First Law of Motion:


A body remains at rest or moves in a straight line at a constant speed unless it is acted upon by an outside force.


If you look back at the definition of acceleration, you will see that: (1) a body at rest is not accelerating; and (2) a body moving in a straight line at a constant speed is not accelerating either. Thus, the first law of Newton says that objects do not accelerate unless they are acted upon by an outside force.


Newton's Second Law of Motion:


If a force, F, works on a body of mass M, then the acceleration, A, is given by


F = M A


The first law said that if there is acceleration, then there is a force. Newton's second law gives a quantitative relationship between the force and the acceleration that is observed. The relationship depends on a new property of the object, its mass. The mass is simply a measure of the amount of material in the object; mass is conventionally measured in grams or kilograms. Note that the second law implies that, for a given force, a less massive body will accelerate more than a more massive body. This is consistent with the world you are familiar with. Shove your kid brother, he might move a long way; shove Shaquille O'Neal with the same force and he won't move that far...


Newton's Third Law of Motion:


If one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.


This law is sometimes called the ``Action-Reaction'' law. Consider what happens if you are in one row boat and you pull on a line attached to a second row boat. When you pull the line, you exert a force on the second boat. But, by the third law, the other boat exerts an equal and opposite force back on you. Thus, if the second row boat has a large shipment of bricks in it so it is very heavy, your lighter boat may do all the moving even though you are doing all the pulling.


Implications for the Planets


The elliptical orbits of the planets have such small eccentricities that, to a very good approximation, we can think of them as circles. (Only very precise measurements, like those available to Kepler, are able to detect the difference.) This means that we can use the idea of uniform circular motion to analyze planetary motion. In that section, we revealed that a body in uniform circular motion was constantly accelerating towards the center of its circular track. Thus, according to Newton's first law of motion, there must be a force acting on the planet that is always directed toward the center of the orbit -- that is toward the Sun!


Newton's second law of motion allows us to state what the magnitude of that force must be. The required force is just the mass of the Earth times its acceleration. We know that the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion is A = V2/R. Thus, we can calculate the force that is required to keep the Earth on its circular path and compare it to physical theories about what that force might be. This is what Newton later did, although he did it first for the Moon rather than the Earth, to learn about the force of Gravity.


Finally, let us consider an implication of the ``action-reaction'' law. If there is a force that attracts the Earth toward the Sun, then there must be an equal and opposite force attracting the Sun towards the Earth. Why, then, doesn't the Sun move? The answer is that it does move, but by a very small amount since the mass of the Sun is about half a million times that of the Earth. Thus, when subjected to the equal and opposite force required by the third law, it accelerates about half a million times less than the Earth as well. For this reason, to a very good approximation, we can treat the Sun as stationary in our studies of planetary motion.


Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation


By now you must be wondering: ``What is the Force that keeps the Earth going around the Sun?'' Newton's great discovery was the force of {\sl gravity}, which is an attractive force that occurs between two masses. The Universal Law of Gravitation is usually stated as an equation:


Fgravity = G M1 M2 / r2


where Fgravity is the attractive gravitational force between two objects of mass M1 and M2 separated by a distance r. The constant G in the equation is called the Universal Constant of Gravitation. The value of G is:


G = 6.67 X 10-11 meters3 kilograms-1 seconds-2


Newton's great step was developing this law and using it, with his laws of motion, to explain the motion of lots of different things --- from falling objects to planets. Amazingly, out of these simple and general rules, Newton was able to show that all of Kepler's descriptive laws for orbits followed as a direct consequence.


When you combine Newton's gravitation and circular acceleration, which must balance in order for the object to remain in orbit, you get a nice relation between the period, distance, and mass of the central body. It beings by equating the centripetal force (Fcent) due to the circular motion to the gravitational force (Fgrav): Fgrav = Fcent


Fgrav = G m1 m2 / r2
Fcent = m2 V2 /r


Let the Earth be m1 and the Moon be m2. For circular motion the distance r is the semi-major axis a. The orbital velocity of the Moon can be described as distance/time, or circumference of the circular orbit divided by the orbital period:


V = 2 pi r /P


so setting the forces equal yields


G m1 m2 / a2 = m2 V2 /a


note that the m2 will cancel, so that circular orbital motion is independent of the mass of the orbiting body!


G m1 / a2 = ((2 pi a)2/P2)/a


which we rearrange to place all the a-terms on the right and all the P-terms on the left:


G m1/(4 pi2) P2 = a3


which should look startlingly like Kepler's third law, but this time for the Earth's mass (or any other) instead of the sun's mass. To use a and P to solve for mass, manipulate once more so that


m1 = a3 (4 pi2/G) / P2

 The end of the button is near. Eventually grey will become the most desirable and rare color. *It pays to stay pure in the end* 




 Yeah... it was once 2015. 




 Ok, so I got out of school, and for some strange reason it was already night-time. Just then, me and a group of students and teachers noticed a close-up flying plane that was flying in strange patterns. It wasn't flying stable, it it sometimes went in circles. A few times it even flipped back and flew backwards. Next thing we knew, it took a dive and crashed nearby... there was no huge explosion but still a loud crash. Everyone was apathic about it though.... just talking about it. Just then, like 4 other planes started flying in strange patterns.... ends here.

p.s. It was a lucid dream. 




 CONFIRMED 




 GgG 




 Show me your stuff. 




 Thanks, I'm gonna look forward into buying one like that :) 




 Someday, grey will be the most desirable... trust me. *Stay pure*

 Yes, it is now April 30th 2016 









 Yes! Those of us who can resist the temptation to press will be saved! :)

 Yeah... maybe. But my physics teacher is the least strict teacher I have... he's very lenient. Maybe it was just a random strange dream. 




 I'm a guy... actually. I like cute and innocent-looking girls.... 




 Yeah... the Rat is a god down here... AIEYAIEYAIEYAIEYAIEY!!! {:'-D 




 *Gasp*... apologies... 




 It's ok... no worries

 I just thought of a great idea for the sub.... this thread could be for posting many basement pictures, of different areas. I have posted some already. 









 Thanks :) 




 It's kinda cool... I'd love to have a moth tattoo with the soft texture able to be felt :) 




 What does it mean? 




 Nope.

 Heyy 




 One very disturbing dream I had when I was 4, was that I bit off someone's tounge and ate it... *I was only 4.* 




 It has no relevance to your relationship(at least it shouldn't, in my opinion). 




 A 




 I also used to have many dreams involving my body parts falling off... my eyes, fingers, arms, etc. Probably just strange dreams, or maybe worrying about that particular body part's health? 




 Why!?

Ok, so in the dream I was able to summon a cow(with horns) that came out of the floor(breaking the floor). It didn't actually hurt people, but it did cause a bit of destruction. So I summoned it during school, and it came out of the floor but just then my physics teacher came! A huge pool of water just appeared out of nowhere(about 30 feet deep) and my physics teacher wrestled the cow to death(he killed the cow in the pool). WTF!? I know my physics teacher isn't capable of doing that in real life! He's a good guy! Whyyy oh **whyyyyyyy!!??**

EDIT: Also whenever the cow appeared, classic country music started playing. 




 Ok, so I was sitting outside, and all of the sudden a moth looking similar to a gypsy moth flew right towards my right forearm and embeded itself into my skin. It was just slightly painful, but the moth's soft texture could be felt when you ran your fingers over it. Why?? Oh why!!?? :D 




 Yay... looks like our hopes are up again. 












































 Any ideas on how to solve it? I've tried decoding/encoding in many ways, but nothing seems to crack it. I don't know why I'm starting to feel this sub-phase is gonna be much harder than we thought... I mean, they do look like the codes A858 posts... and they haven't been solved yet. But I hope I'm wrong.

 Does anyone know how images like the duck one were derived? 




 I really wish I knew... 




 Oh no... you're right. We should maybe refer to it as phase 2.1(flashing gif with 5 and red/green boxes, )phase 2.2(binary with picture), phase 2.3(A858-like codes), etc. 




 She never got annoyed at me.... maybe she just suddenly didn't like me anymore? 




 But does it mean you hate the guy? 




 But thats not what he's asking... lol... click on the pic of snoo and it'll take you to some post... 




 I wonder what happens when we complete the last phase.... 




 Some cool flairs might be like trophies(for users who solve a ~~phase~~ page/part of a phase), and for regular use... maybe small pics from the website might be cool? 




 Hmmm.... by the way, for phase 5, the code looks similar to the codes posted by A858... maybe whoever solves this phase, might also reveal the key to solving A858... it seems hard though. 




 6.Password: 70325

Solved by Ryuk_ on IRC Explanation: He used the 1001st Fibonacci number, and got the first 5 digits (70330) and substracted 5 from it.

I don't understand.... why the Fibonacci number? 




 That happened to me too... use google chrome, and it should get fixed. 




 Richard Johnson 




 Why do girls do that? Is it because they think a guy is starting to like them? 




 It's because of your cute smile and with your eyes, it makes you look so innocent! When most people see you, it's similar to the feeling one gets when they look at cute things like [this](http://www.godity.com/content/img/4/469.jpg). I personally love innocent-looking girls! Just saying...lol

 This girl I knew last year... I started talking to her and we became friends. Every time she saw me in the school hallways, she said hi and smiled. We also did this peace-thingy with the 2 fingers. But one day near the end of the year, I waved at her to say "hi" and she just looked away. The year ended.... and this year started. I saw her two times in the hallway and she just looked away as if she doesn't know me. What the hell? I mean, I didn't have a crush on her but why pretend she doesn't know me even after long time no see?
