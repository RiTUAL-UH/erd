 It's amazing, i watched it the day before maker faire and it's perfect in all ways, the shooting, story board and production. Only disadvantage is they didn't ... Well, not gonna ruin it for you :) Watch it on Friday! 














 
Well I haven't tried it and most probably will get an Android! The iPhone 6 is really ridiculous. 




 LoL 




 Well look at the specs here! Arduino Due + 11 sesnors + Wifi + Bluetooth! 

Check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mibHgib7Rh8) and you'll see 




 It's gonna be for $149 only! 



























































 Yea but you'll get more exposure if you hit Kickstarter! check our [campaign](kickstarter.com/projects/integreight/1sheeld-replace-your-arduino-shields-with-your-sma), and let me know if you need any help in making your campaign :) 




 Why not make a Kickstarter campaign? 




 How come! ok try the [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/integreight/1sheeld-replace-your-arduino-shields-with-your-sma) 




 Works fine here! What about now? 




 good question, i'll get you the photos tomorrow, it's normal though you won't be impressed. 




 Woops sorry about that! it's 1Sheeld.com 




 Great! Let's meet tomorrow then! My twitter is @Amroosaleh, reach me anytime when you are there, will show you my [gadget](https://www.1sheeld.com) I'm sure you'll like it! 




 Cool! will pass by your booth tomorrow ;) will show you my [gadget](https://www.1sheeld.com) as well! 




 Nop! But I'm attending the Open HW Summit   Makerfaire Rome 














 Yup, that's it! Thanks .. 
























 my bad! so what do you think? 
























 Just get a Spark Core, it's for $39 and they have amazing software. Check spark.io 




 Thanks! Yea he's wearing it in his [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Human-Jukebox/) 









 Check out the Arduino shield: [1Sheeld](http://1sheeld.com) it lets you use your smart phone easily with Arduino, you don't have to have that much tech. experience, with one line of code you can post on your twitter account from Arduino! 














 If you aren't familiar with [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com), it is a physical Arduino shield that connects to smart-phones using bluetooth and make use of their sensors and capabilities inside your Arduino sketch.

It is used mainly for rapid prototyping of your ideas. Instead of buying multiple shields and components to connect them to your Arduino, you can make use of your smart-phone's accelerometer, gyroscope, gravity, gps, speech recognition, screen ...etc with out buying them individually. Currently we have more than 30 of those. You can visit our [website](http://1sheeld.com) or our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/integreight/1sheeld-replace-your-arduino-shields-with-your-sma) campaign to know more.

We are planning to launch a new feature to our platform. We will enable 1Sheeld users to connect to other 1Sheelds from their Arduino sketch using our Android app.


This feature will enable you to:

* Read a digital pin from your remote Arduino(s).
* Write to a digital pin to your remote Arduino(s).
* Write to an analog pin (PWM) to your remote Arduino(s).
* Send string or float messages to your remote Arduino(s).
* Get notified whenever an input digital pin in your remote Arduino(s) changes its state.

You have to have 1Sheeld board, an Arduino board and a Bluetooth-enabled Android smart-phone in EACH network node to make use of this feature.

Here is an example code for what the sketch will look like: http://pastebin.com/6AJdXZfY

So what are your thoughts? do you think it worth the effort? We think it will help people prototype connected-hardware projects and ideas easily.
And if you think it is beneficial? what other features can we add? 







































 I hear the next Arduino IDE will be web based, also try codebender.cc 


































 Link for the app: http://bit.ly/1wjijh6
Link for the source code: http://bit.ly/1FgwuNF 














 I'm building a product based on the Raspberry Pi as the control unit, but I want to modify on the design by removing some components to make it cheaper. Thanks for the link! 









 It's ideal for rapid prototyping, I'm posting on twitter with only 1 line of code from Arduino, used before in our booth during a big event and the output was amazing. 









 Hey guys, Amr here from the makers of 1Sheeld, you can chec out a lot of examples by the community on Hackster.io/1Sheeld

Also you can check out some [projects on instructables](http://www.instructables.com/howto/1sheeld/) and let me know if you need anything :) 




 That's awesome, would you share an instructable after you finish? :) 




 Okay, what are the cheapest components to assemble it? do you have a good tutorial? 














 no i don't think it will be relevant to children, especially with the gun part! 









 This one is also amazing:
