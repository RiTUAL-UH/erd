 When pressed you jump back to the last thing happened: a building or unit that just finished, or when you get attacked.
Its not super super vital, but comes in handy sometimes. 




 Dat Thorzain smirk in the background  









 Lagging as hell for me too (EU), almost unwatchable. 




 So sad i am not able to play this qualifier, next one i will be attending for sure! 




 very surprised no one posed [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDHHdrDQx_A) 




 This + SSX and a lot of EA games where basically my musical education. Man, was (am) always jamming out while playing need for speed! 




 really confused by the cum-like stains on your shirt.. 




 Best dancer in SC2, would love to see those moves in the booth haha!
 




 Ax.HyuN plz 




 SC2 HOTS! 




 Cmon guys, this impersonator deserves an audience! 




 Anyone up for making a platinum/diamond team? I am really lacking practice partners, or a decent place to find a few.. 




 Pretty known for sc2 players: try google "zerg rush" and get that korean APM! 




 [Here you go](http://www.dlcompare.com/games/cd-key-download-starcraft-2-european-127) this is keys only though i think.

Also, pretty new to reddit, thought it was cool to share, guess not :( 




 All i can say is: Thank you dApollo for your awesome tutorials! 
























 Its kinda lame they re-used so many stuff from the other trailer.

Still hyped though! 




 Well, that is the least touched game on my desktop i think, and i have only played a few PvP's. So i can't really tell if it's pay to win. 

It's pretty fun though, but i prefer the old aoe (: 




 basically [this](http://imgur.com/xVEZDJP).

everything besides sc2 casually though. 




 AHWWWW man, I LOVE SC2!!! 




 This series is soooo nerve wrecking 0__o 




 are there any vods anywhere? (:
 




 Yo buddy, caps lock button is right above the shift key on the left. 




 I DON'T KNOW KEV! 




 well that took a nosedive 




 Darn, missed it, can i watch a vod somewhere? (:
EDIT: already found it, thank you for casting that! hope you liked it (:
oh and you pronounced my name really funny but no worries, the 'oe' sounds doesn't exist in English(: 




 may i ask why you made this?  




 Submitted mine!  




 This is from quite a while ago, and it is embarrasing to watch for me now, but i think this was the closest game in my still short SC2 career, hope you like it (: 









 assholes in german. 




 may I ask where you live? Hillevi is far from a normal (cat) name where i come from
. 




 Grubby is like, oh this guy again 0__o 
























 And Blizzard WCS if that is gonna be held again. 




 JoRoShaRk 




 Wasn't this posted on here like a few months ago? I've already seen this somewhere for sure.. 




 I was plat in WoL, got placed in silver, quite disappointed. Just got gold today, but i dont really feel confident in my use of the new units. Lots of work to do! 




 Ik ben sowieso aanwezig! Zin in! 




 I dont know if this was already posted on here, but Totalbiscuit made quite an interesting [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwAo8lcAC4) about this topic. 




 the two best analitical casters out there, woohoo! I also like the choice for Take as host. And geoff just always makes me laugh. Man, this tourney is gonna be awesome! 




 Are there any pictures of the whole thing out of the water? 




 when life gives me lemons imma throw em at your car. 




 you a pretty dirty window. 




 Ja hoor jongens, weer iets om trots op te zijn! 




 Och nee, heeft t weer gesneeuwd? 0__o 




 parting's multitasking was so incredible throughout the whole mid   lategame!! 




 Oh wow, i listened many many times to this song, but never saw this vid, thanks! 









 Wow, this just hits the nail on the head. Everyone is always talking about how the mainstream music becomes worse and worse, but this just proves it. 




 that's what she said.. 
























 Radical Face - Welcome home, Son. When the chorus kicks in, still gives me the same, happy feeling every time i hear it. [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8a4iiOnzsc)  




 Really loving all the subtle things in this season so far, the zealot in the dish, the cheese throwing, the balance joking (reaper changes, super long range on nexus cannon) Just gives it that little extra! 




 Because getting laid is of course the only purpouse of playing guitar. 




 Does anyone know if the startale video where Legend is trying to become a pro player is on youtube? I cant seem to find it, really enjoyed it when they played it during a tournament. 




 do you happen to have a link to that VOD? 




 TIL op_is_sea_gm_fyi is a fellow dutchmen 




 I think Huk and Ret aren't talking about the same thing, huk complains about him getting denied to compete in both code A and WCS NA/EU while players in code S are allowed to do this, Ret is giving his opinion about koreans playing in WCS NA/EU in the first place. 2 very different things 




 basically your MMR (the hidden ranking score system blizzard uses) has to be steady in the league you want to get promoted too. What this means: when you face, and win from gold players regularly you will get promoted soon. It can be a bit random sometimes though. 




 thats pretty sweet! 




 Well as its a new game the timing aren't figured out yet. So i think you can get into diamond now with decent mechanics, i play a reactionary style most of the time. 




 So I (diamond Protoss) just started playing around a bit on the unranked ladder as Zerg (my zerg skills are bronze/silver i think). 
I got matched vs a platinum protoss player and lost quite badly.
after the match i noticed that his league symbol changed to diamond.
So after a quick chat i found out he queued for the ranked ladder, and got promoted to diamond after the match. I think this is a bit unfair. **What do you guys think?**

TL;DR: Opponent gets promoted on the back of my diamond protoss MMR, while I played offrace on the unranked ladder. Fair/unfair? 




 Amsterdam is 4 meters below sealevel, so a flood is pretty likely to happen somewhere in the future. 




 I used a build like this in WoL a lot, but it indeed does work vs 3 hatch openings in HotS.
I don't have an exact build order, but here is roughly what i do:

FFE, if you can gateway before cannon (scout no early pool)
2 gasses
gateway 100% -- cyber core.
zealot (send to watchtower/third base if you 
chronoboost in probes until cybercore is finished, after that only chrono boost cybercore
+1 att @ 100gas (chrono when you can)
stalker.
3 gates @50% cybercore
stop probe production
3/4/5 more gates
forward pylons
should be hitting around 8:30-9:00 i think.

Hope this helps! 




 Hots started out really rough, got placed in silver after beeing plat in WoL. But after laddering for a week im back, [better than ever!](http://imgur.com/NarmerN) 




 whoopsie, missed that post/sticky. Sorry! 









 Same happened to me, got placed in silver and ranked up to plat in a few days. Sad thing is i was plat already in WoL. Oh well lets aim for diamond my brotoss!
