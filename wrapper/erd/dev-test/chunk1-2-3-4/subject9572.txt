 Happy Reddit Birthday! 




 I think the special prices are relative to the monthly prices, not relative to the one year price. You get a savings on the one, two or three year prices if you use any of the monthly prices as your reference.

 Particles from the sun, such as those from a solar flare, travel much slower than light and therefore the delay. 




 The article loses credibility when the title states "... Should Hit Early Tuesday Morning (2/13/2011)"  Tuesday is not 2/13. 




 Not really.  The difference between a hard drive and a solid state drive is more than semantics.  They are physically quite different approaches to storage.  I'm betting it's an error in the ad.

 In terms of solar masses, the MW black hole is not 1,000 but 4,000,000.  The article states the M87 black hole 6.6 billion solar masses, while the MW black hole is 4 million solar masses.

6.6 billion / 4 million = 1650 so the M87 black hole is a 1650 times more massive than the MW black hole.

 




 The existence of anti-matter has been proved by many experiments. Scientists generate and measure anti-matter particles every day in particle accelerators. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter 




 mr_lightswitch is correct, I should have stated "... over a thousand times more massive that the Milky Way's central black hole"

 Too late, I closed my account with B of A 15 years ago.  The reason? They said my account was overdrawn.  I checked my account balance and had more than $2K in it.  I called them up and they said, oh sorry we made a mistake.  Two weeks later same thing happened so I went into the branch.  They looked up my account and said, now Mr. Sheridan, we've had this conversation with you before and this is becoming a recurring problem.  I said, no shit, this is a recurring problem. Now close my account and give me my balance right now. They finally realized there was a different Mr. Sheridan whose account was overdrawn.  It was disturbing they couldn't even keep the accounts of two people with the same last name straight.

 Impressive aircraft in many respects.  Example 1: It was designed to leak fuel while on the ground (ok, maybe they couldn't help this) then seal itself as thermal expansion of joints took effect when the aircraft came up to temperature due to heating from air friction at operational speeds.

 Apparently you don't see the number of down votes you're receiving and recognize you're way off base, at least with respect to leading scientific theories.  

Maybe you're starting your own dark matter theory here on Reddit.  If it blows your dress up, go for it. 




 Once you create a facility that deep, you get multiple uses since many experiments are corrupted by cosmic rays. The mine is used to detect muons (product of cosmic ray collisions), neutrinos and dark matter.   




 I've stopped trying to figure out the rationale for up vs down votes. 




 Not to be argumentative, but dark matter is not the same as a black hole, at least according to the leading theories.  Dark matter appears to be more or less uniformly distributed within each galaxy, not necessarily between the galaxies and not tied up in individual localized black holes.  It is affected by gravity but not other forces such as electromagnetism.  Therefore dark matter is gravitationally attracted to galaxies as is ordinary matter.  

Dark matter is the only explanation scientists have for the orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters and the rotational speed of individual galaxies (spinning on their own axes).  Without the extra unseen mass explained by dark matter, galaxies would not behave as they do as they spin.

The vast majority of the dark matter in the universe is believed to be made up of nonbaryonic particles, and thus not formed out of atoms and not wrapped in the confines of black holes.

 At the rate it is traveling (~17 km/sec) it will take Voyager about 60 billion years to arrive at Andromeda, our nearest galaxy at a distance of about 2 million light years.  Keeping in mind our entire universe is a only ~13 billion years old, it is doubtful the sun and earth, let alone the human race, will even exist if/when it arrives.  Doesn't sound like a practical solution. 




 Agreed

 By "accepts wind from any direction" I mean from any direction in the horizontal plane, not from above or below.  This is true because the device is circularly symmetric so wind striking it from N, S, E or W will have the same affect on the turbine's rotation. 




 Yea, would like to see some numbers.  The best we have to go on is "... final costs of about $1.50/watt rated output, which is roughly 2/3 the cost of comparable bladed units."  Not a huge improvement but significant enough to pursue if it can be put to practice. 

I don't think the bladeless turbine needs a swivel base since it accepts wind from any direction unlike a bladed turbine - another advantage for the bladeless design.

 Thank you for that explanation.  Another response from an expert - two for two today.

Follow up question to your statement that we can measure dark energy.  How is that done?  Is the estimate based on the acceleration of the universe's expansion or some other method?   




 Wow, a response from an expert - thank you.  

Do you think the same is true with dark energy, that is no connection with hidden dimensions?

 Actually if you consider both Northern and Southern hemispheres each have a Vernal and Autumnal equinox, just 180 deg out of phase with each other, the article is correct in saying the Vernal equinox happens twice each year.  




 Correction, GMT-7 not GMT-8, at least for the next couple weeks until the rest of the world goes onto daylight savings time.  I really hate that the U.S. decided to mess around with the daylight savings time dates. 




 The article is a bit misleading when it says the Vernal equinox occurs twice a year.  Actually an equinox occurs twice a year but one is the Vernal and the other is the Autumnal.  They sort of clear it up in the last part of the sentence when they mention both. 




 You are correct but the planned shut down won't be for a while.  In a couple weeks they will start slamming the beams together to achieve 7 TeV collisions and keep that up for 18 - 24 months.  After the 7 TeV tests they plan to shut LHC down for a year or more. They need the break to complete repairs for an electrical failure that occurred in 2008 and to prepare the collider for the maximum 14 TeV collisions.  That'll be when the real sparks fly.

 That is sufficiently close to sunset for the satellite to still be in view of the Sun and then pass into the Earth's shadow. 




 CliffDropOver is correct.  Eventually the satellite will pass into the Earth's shadow and appear to fade away.  How close in time to sunset/sunrise were you when you saw the satellite fade? 




 Oh, thanks for the clarification. 




 By the way, reddit put the NSFW tag on the link so they would seem to agree.

 No one has mentioned security yet. OSX has security vulnerabilities just like any OS, but Apple does not respond to these vulnerabilities as quickly as they should. Microsoft has shown an increased vigilance that Apple could learn from. Because Apple has enjoyed decades of small percentage market penetration theyve lulled themselves into thinking theyre more secure, but its really because they havent been attacked. The numbers are growing dramatically, and in my view it's simply a matter of time before the Mac OS experiences a big time hack. This is from a Mac fan boy. 




 I believe you are correct.  The sun is much larger with respect to the planet sizes than shown at any of the planet scale slider settings.  Also the planets are much too large in relation to their orbit sizes when the setting is at 1.0. 




 If so, God help us. 




 I am an electrical engineer and of all the classes I had at the undergraduate level, thermodynamics was the worst.  I could relate entropy to chaos but I couldn't translate the concept to "practical" problems. I'll never forget the problem: "A drop of rain falls from the sky into the ocean.  Does the entropy of the universe increase or decrease?" I had the class for 10 weeks and still couldn't get the answer to make intuitive sense.   




 I believe a photon is a fundamental quantum particle - doesn't break down any further (at least with today's physics). 




 nice 




 Couldn't agree more.  My wife and I who are both Apple fans bought one.  Weren't satisfied with its restrictions so we hacked it with ATVFlash to get more control and access of media not on iTunes.  Hack was too quirky and unreliable so we sold the AppleTV after a couple months and bought a Mac Mini instead.   We realized we needed a much more open media center, not a device that operates through iTunes like a big iPod (or should I say iPad?) 




 I like your take on this and have changed my mind.  U.S. broadband speeds are not shameful, just disappointing.  But I can (and obviously will) live with it.  We are fortunate to live in the times we do. 




 Magnetism is a subcomponent of light.  Light is an electromagnetic (electric + magnetic) phenomenon where both are intimately and orthogonally coupled.  So yes, the effect of magnetism travels at (not less than) the speed of light.

The answer to your question is yes, the other magnet would continue to repel for the time it took light (electromagnetism) to travel the distance between the two magnets. 




 Yes it's much more practical and economical to implement higher speed broadband in smaller countries.  Here's a site to give you a feel for broadband speeds in the U.S. http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/ 




 Understand and it probably won't come to pass, but look where the U.S. broadband speed currently stands wrt other nations http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Images/commentarynews/broadbandspeedchart.jpg

 Thanks for the link.  Aldrin's quote is summarized here:
"There is a monolith there, a very unusual structure on this little potato-shaped object that goes around Mars once every seven hours. When people find out about that, they are going to say 'who put that there?'. Well, the universe put it there, or if you choose, God put it there." 




 Thanks, now that is helpful.

 I'd go for the PS3.  I watch blu-ray and my son does gaming on the PS3.  It has worked well for over two years for both applications.

 The angle subtended by the black hole would be minuscule compared to the angle subtended by the massive galaxy, assuming the black hole was about midway between the Milky Way and the other galaxy.  This means the black hole would create a very small area of distortion in the image of the galaxy as viewed by a high power telescope (say Hubble).  Although some of the galaxy's image will be directly blocked (absorbed) by the black hole, much of this dark area will be filled in by light being bent (due to gravitational lensing) around the black hole.   




 Black holes theorized to be at the center of most galaxies are not good candidates for direct observation.  A black hole in the center of a galaxy is obscured by numerous stars, dust and other galactic debris shrouding the center.  That includes the black hole in the center of our galaxy.  Galactic centers are pretty dense areas. 




 I believe we can estimate the mass of a black hole pretty well for the case you give (a binary system containing a black hole and a star) for the reason you stated.  The path of the visible star is affected in a measurable way.  Scientists can estimate the mass of most visible stars pretty accurately based on distance and brightness.  Given the mass of the visible star and the diameter of its rotation around the unseen object (black hole) they can measure the mass of the black hole fairly accurately.  

I may not understand what you're getting with your comment on the "extra gravity".   You may be thinking that dark matter is matter that falls into a black hole?  If so, that is not dark matter.  Scientists theorize that dark matter is generally distributed around the galaxy and is not localized within black holes.  Although any matter can fall into a black hole (dark or energetic) and increase its mass accordingly.  It's all the same to the black hole.  Once it falls in, it is no longer defined as dark or anything else, it's just added mass to the black hole.

Yes, the black hole's event horizon will increase in size as it becomes more massive and this extra mass is quite measurable when the black hole is paired up with a star.  Other methods can be used to measure a black hole's mass such as gravitation lensing.

Another example of matter that interacts very weakly with other matter is the neutrino.  Neutrinos have almost negligible mass, no charge, travel nearly at the speed of light and do not interact with matter (almost). The mass and speed of neutrinos are still not certain and are being investigated. 




 Tyson is using the term "us" loosely.  Dark matter does not interact with us as individuals in a way we can measure directly on Earth.  But it does interact with the rest of our Milky Way galaxy and other galaxies as well as larger structures (galaxy clusters).  Astrophysicists have measured the rotation of these galaxies and stars within the galaxies.  They can't explain how the galaxies' rotations occur when they consider only the visible stars.  Keep in mind the rotation is not just the galaxy as a whole but the rotation rates of stars within the galaxies at varying distance from the galactic center. The only explanation that explains the internal rotations is additional mass distributed in and around the galaxies that cannot be seen (dark) and does not interact with electromagnetic energy.  
 




 Much better video.  Thank you. 




 A solar system reference frame is defined by the Sun not the Earth.  The Earth revolves around the Sun at many thousands of miles per hour.  If the helicopter is fixed with respect to the Sun, the Earth will immediately either slam into it or zoom away from at many thousands of miles per hour (depending on which side of the earth the helicopter is located with respect to the Earth's motion around the Sun) as it revolves around the Sun.  The pilot will either be crushed by the collision or be left in space to suffocate and freeze.  This won't take 12 hours but seconds
 
Did you possibly mean the Earth as the reference frame?  That is the only reference frame where fractions of a day (12 or 24 hrs) come into play. 




 Yes, you can have a point fixed in an expanding universe.   Think of an expanding balloon where the surface of the balloon is the reference frame. As the balloon (universe) expands, the point will expand with it.  Locally it will appear fixed but it will be moving away from other fixed points like points on the balloon's surface.  

You don't need to have a center to have a fixed point.  In this analogy, the balloon's surface has no center (the interior of the balloon is not part of the analogy, just the surface).  The same holds true with the universe. 




 No 




 Your scenario about a "fixed point in space" is ambiguous.  Space has many frames of reference: the earth, solar system, galaxy, galaxy cluster, super cluster and universe.  Each of these "space" reference frames moves at a different speed and rotates (and expands) at a different rate.  So first clarify your reference frame ... do you really mean the solar system or the earth or something else as your reference frame?  The answer to your question depends entirely on your reference frame.

When I think of a "fixed point in space", I think of the universe. 




 When it comes to advancing science at this level we often can't predict what the benefits will be.  Consider when the lasing effect was predicted by Einstein then later confirmed in the 60's through the invention of the laser.  Uses for the laser are almost too many to list but I'm guessing Einstein or the inventor or even the science community at large had no idea what the laser would eventually bring to our world.  
























 No pun intended.

 Amazing how they captured the crashing sounds of the CME ;-) 




 Well put. 




 I concur with what you're saying, but one point of correction:

 Many particles, such as electrons, are considered "point particles" in that they have zero dimension and take up exactly zero space. They have zero mass as well, and as such, travel at the speed of light.

That is not correct. You may be thinking of a photon. An electron does have mass and does not travel at the speed of light, maybe close but not equal to c.  




 Agreed.  A great many of the empirical tests they ran in '59 would now be run through simulation on a computer. 




 Not sure, but I'd like to know. 




 No, the headline is correct - the first thief reports the (implied second) theft to the police.  Reread the story. 




 I have them an use their color options on occasion.  I agree with Algorab.  The app definitely needs an upgrade.

 I find it very surprising Apple's graphics chipsets don't support H.264 encoding in Macs as late as early 2011 given 1) how firmly Apple supported this standard and 2) the chipset is in iPads but not Macs.  Does Air Parrot perform the same function in software?

 Good question.  I would guess the overall mass of the proton is the determined by the quarks' direct interactions with the Higgs field plus the mass equivalent of the interaction energy between the quarks interacting with the Higgs field.  Otherwise the proton's mass would just reflect the measly sum of the three quarks' mass.

 I have a V shaped scar on my side just below my ribs. Happened when as an 8 year old I was climbing a tree with a friend.  He was out on the end of a branch and i was near the trunk on the same branch.  He climbed out a bit too far and branch gave way. We both fell.  He fell into a mud puddle and I fell onto a wire fence which impaled me in my side.  Luckily no internal organs were damaged but I received 32 stitches in the shape of a V.  I'm amazed I don't have a fear of heights and still like to climb. 




 Ah, I see it is but from another paper (NY Times vs CNN). I checked for the same link before I posted but didn't check for other similar links. My bad.

 Check out the D8 interview. My wife attended and during the Q A at 1:26:35 she asked Jobs a good question about DHCP. 
 




 Good answer - thanks. 




 That would make much more sense. 




 That was a request, not a demand. 




 Camera settings were: 200 mm, f/40 1.6 sec, ISO 6400.  I used three layers of 5% visible light transmission window tinting film.  I think that means there was only 0.05 * 0.05 * 0.05 = 0.000125 (0.0125%) transmission.  That would explain why I needed such a high ISO setting and exposure time.

 My wife noticed it while we were catching up on season 6.  She had just interviewed Robert and he showed us the products he's invented.  I wouldn't be surprised if there are other TV commercials of his products on Dexter episodes.

 She clearly is a non technical person who should not attempt to convey technical concepts. 




 They have to shut down the LHC every winter because its high energy requirements are not compatible with the sourrounding population's higher energy needs during the winter (i.e. not enough power to do both).

 Freaking weirdest funeral procession I have ever seen, probably due to North Korean editing. Commentators are over the top with emotion. The background moaning is a bit much and clearly looped. 




 yep 




 The light source in the middle of the Einstein ring is a luminous red galaxy (LRG) as stated in the text, not just a single star.  It looks like a star since it's so far away and all of the stars in the galaxy appear to be collapsed to a single blob. Sniperchild is correct that the galaxy has a black hole in the middle, as almost all galaxies do.   




 ditto 




 A single atom does not have sufficient density to form a black hole because an atom is mostly empty space - very small nucleus surrounded by a relatively large cloud of light electrons. You have to get rid of the electron cloud and compress the nuclei of multiple atoms to get a sufficiently high density. 




 The point of the article is that a mass of 3x the sun is sufficient, but just barely, to form a black hole.  This does not mean that all stars with a mass of 3x that of our sun are or become black holes.  It requires special conditions for a black hole of such a low mass to develop from gravitational collapse of a star.  Also, black holes with a mass much less than our sun are postulated to exist.  These primordial black holes do not form from the gravitational collapse of a star but are remnants from the big bang.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole

I'm convinced that in addition to science   technology influencing scifi, the converse is true as well.  I'd like to think people who make decisions that affect society in significant ways are influenced by the type of messages Star Trek delivers.

 You're right - we know of no planets within a 100 light years that could support life capable of receiving our broadcasts.

However, SETI isn't about someone else receiving our broadcasts - it's about us receiving someone else's broadcasts.  If some day they are received, those transmissions will likely have been traveling much longer than 100 years.

 That umbrella would be toast if it were a real lightning strike, but it seems to be intact. 




 Tell him to imagine himself poised precariously on a ledge 20 stories above the street. Then tell him he has the potential to release a lot of energy by simply jumping and plummeting to his death. Lots of blood, broken bones and a high probability of losing his life. Where did it all come from? Potential energy that was turned into kinetic energy then impact. Then  ask if he believes in potential energy. 




 Yes, the Very Long Baseline Array is impressive, but it is an interferometer with lots of spatial ambiguity.  This array would yield more of a focused main beam with very low sidelobes.  That is one of the reasons the individual arrays are somewhat randomly rather than periodically placed.  

The toy comparison was a bit charged.  I am completely enthralled by the LHC and can't wait for full power operation.  I was only indicating it is small in size compared to this array. 




 That's like saying "The pixel on a CCD would fit comfortably in this period."  But that's not the entire sensor.  Sure the central region would fit in the LHC, but the entire collection of arrays spans over 3000 km (see the end of the video).  The LHC at about 9 km in diameter is tiny compared to the entire array.  This array would derive its very fine spatial resolution from its large dimension.  That is what makes it impressive, not the central region by itself.  

Admittedly, this array may never be built.  But the scope would be impressive and the performance unprecedented if it were. 




 Our Sun is quite a dynamic star. 




 Yeah, that's annoying.  SAI seems to enjoy spreading these things over many pages, probably to get more hits. 




 Yes, but in addition the odd shaped earth shows the strength of gravity varying around the globe with the yellow and red areas being the strongest and the blue areas being the weakest.

 Why does it suck?  Is it not accurate?

 I don't see how this European law can possibly be implemented in a reasonable manner given the number of requests that will eventually be submitted along with their subjectivity.   




 What is dark energy and how does it work? 




 Granted the "dark side" of the moon is an incorrect term (should be far side or opposing side), but it's a term that is generally accepted and understood ... and it makes a great name for an album. 




 Gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the human body, which is probably why it is used in this application. 




 Instead, the [near-infrared laser] light excites the free electrons on the gold nanoparticles and causes them to heat up and generate energy, eventually making the cancer cells to explode.

Your guess is probably correct. The expansion/explosion of the cancer cell is likely caused by liquid within the cell that is heated by the gold particles and turned into vapor.

 It depends a lot on what you want to get out of the meet-up, but yes to all of the items you mentioned for Tom's meet-up.  I think this is one of the many methods Tom uses to build a strong community.  For me its a chance to meet and talk with people who are interested in technology.  Generally I find a connection that I didnt expect to make with a few people, and its not always about technology.  That's what makes these meet-ups interesting.  Tom was a very gracious and engaging host and Jennie was very good at introducing each attendee to the group. 

I asked my wife who also attended for her response to your question and this was her reply: 
 
 Definitely meetups are informal and are what you choose to make of them.  Expect to introduce yourself to people and try to find things you have in common. If you go expecting people to start the conversation for you, you may be disappointed. You dont have to imbibe in alcoholic beverages - some will, some wont but its non-discriminatory. 
 
 The subjects in which we engaged last night included:
 
 * Star Trek
 * Captain America/Agents of Shield
 * A guy walked by with an xkcd shirt on so that made for easy conversation
 * Whether to add an SSD to your computer
 * Whos still using XP (through no fault of their own)
 * The future of journalism (and what does it even mean)
 * Youtube subscriptions vs. Podcast subscriptions (and is it too hard)

 Good point regarding the mass of this body more likely putting it in the rogue planet vs. brown dwarf category. It appears the mass threshold for deuterium fusion is not precise and is more of a rule of thumb.  

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant:

 The 13 Jupiter mass (MJ) cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13 MJ value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the planet, especially on the amount of helium and deuterium present.[5] 




 Here's a good diagram showing the closest systems to our Sun including WISE's recent brown dwarf discovery.

 Yes, comets travel at very high speeds, but so do all the other bodies in space.  A comet's trajectory can be accurately projected for a rendezvous with a spacecraft, until/unless it comes close to the sun which may change its trajectory.  After a close encounter with the sun (if the comet survives) the trajectory will stabilize and can be recalculated. In any case, it is an impressive feat to land a probe on a comet.

Comets are significant in a few ways.  They contain information that sheds light on the formation of our solar system.  Many scientists believe that comets colliding with the Earth during its formation brought much of the water we have to our planet. There are also theories that comets may have brought life or the building blocks of life to the Earth since organic molecules have been detected in them.

 Evidence of primordial gravitational waves is the leading contender for the announcement.

 For a summary of the paper see this article: 

http://phys.org/news/2014-02-massive-neutrinos-cosmological-conundrum.html 




 Astronomers detected an exploding star in the M82 "Cigar" galaxy. It is most likely a Type Ia supernova, but yet to be confirmed. Type Ia supernovas are created when a white dwarf star collects so much matter from a neighbor that it becomes unstable, collapses upon itself and explodes in very predictable manner.  

Type Ia supernovas are used as "standard candles" to measure distances to very distant galaxies and how fast they are receding from us to determine the rate of acceleration of the universe's expansion.  Since M82 is so close, this is one of the rare Type Ia supernovas that can be observed by amateur astronomers.

 Here's a more technical explanation of ISON's fate.  
http://www.isoncampaign.org/potw-dec02

Bottom line is that ISON was sheared into smaller pieces as it passed through the Sun's corona.  Although some of the larger pieces could be seen exiting the corona, those pieces continued to evaporate/disintegrate (still pretty hot there) and nothing sufficiently large to observe as a comet now remains. 




 Now behind a paywall. Any other sources?

The fact that your reply has an error shows he doesn't follow you.  Let's see your original DM to Phil where you called him out for saying Black Knight.

 Yeah, I first read the title as working on a James Bond submarine car vs. on a working James Bond submarine car. 




 Plus you have to swipe rather than lightly press to get your fingerprint to register. 




 I originally posted this based on a post from Twitter assuming it was true.  Later, based on reading the comments on this post, I did the analysis showing it is not. 




 You can get a free copy of the paper at the prl.aps.org site using this link

 Ok, I suspected this might not be the F, A, C, E musical notes. Many of your comments motivated me to analyze the notes since I don't have perfect (or even decent) pitch.  See this image for a visual of my analysis: http://i.imgur.com/O8JwHHK.png

Thanks to scottjenson for the Facetime ringtone which I used for this analysis.  

First I copied the ringtone into Garageband to visualize the notes in the time domain.  I suspected the first two notes were different from the rest in timing and pitch (maybe the F and A?).  Garageband showed me the timing of the first two is different, but of course nothing about pitch.  

Now to the frequency domain.  I downloaded a free app called iSpectrum which analyzes sounds played in real time through an audio input to your Mac.  I then played the Facetime ringtone and adjusted iSpectrum to focus on the frequency range from 1.0 kHz to 2.6 kHz.  I used the waterfall display where audio amplitudes (highlighted in magenta) are plotted as a function of frequency in the horizontal axis and time in the vertical axis (similar to what sonar operators use).  You can see I played the ringtone six times.  The magenta highlighted areas on the left are the first two notes (short in duration) and the highlighted areas on the right are the note pairs for the remainder of the ringtone (longer in duration). 

Unfortunately, the frequency resolution is not very good.  However, it's good enough to see that the first two notes are around 1.6 kHz while the trailing pairs of notes are around 2.45 kHz (+/- 100 Hz). 

I then went to the phy.mtu.edu site to see how musical notes map into frequencies.  I could not find any F notes that are close to 1.6 kHz nor could I find any C notes that are close to 2.4 - 2.5 kHz.  

My conclusions are 

* The Facetime ringtone notes do not spell FACE
* I'm spending way too much time on this

I'm out. 




 My thoughts exactly.  I'm guessing more info will emerge. 




 I assume you're referring to the statement: 
 There is a bit of a discrepancy regarding what to call the planet, as some astronomers demand that the definition of planet be considered a mass that is tethered to a sun.

The article is not well written.  I think the author should have stated that being tethered to a sun is one of the requirements some astronomers believe a planet should satisfy.
 




 Thanks hokie_u2 - that is helpful.  

I don't agree with Tyson's tweet "Mysteries of #Gravity: Why we enjoy a SciFi film set in make-believe space more than we enjoy actual people set in real space."

I've thoroughly enjoyed actual people set in real space over the years including the Moon landing, Felix Baumgartner skydiving from 128 kft (almost space) and Cmdr. Hadfield performing Space Oddity from the ISS, to name a few.  Knowing it's real makes it that much more interesting and enjoyable. 




 But these quarterly results will include a significant increase in sales of Apple's leading money maker. We'll see how this translates into revenue and profit. 




 I think the problem is that Misek is assuming Apple will react to other mobile phone manufacturers' trends when they have not shown this behavior in the past.

 Birchman is correct, you can export the HD video using AirDrop.  Surprisingly, you can also Message the HD video to anyone, including yourself.   




 Why make this comment on this post?  Seems like my post on r/apple might be a more appropriate subreddit.  

But since you commented, I'm a long time Apple consumer and happy with their products but I'm not their PR.  Believe me, I would love Apple to pay me for my comments, but no luck.  

Regarding posting to two threads quickly, I do that all the time.  It has nothing to do with pretending - it is due to the limited time I have to review reddit and make posts.

 I was 12th in line at my local AT T store and had no trouble getting a 32 GB Space Gray, very efficient operation.  They only carried Space Gray (no Gold or White) but they appeared to have many more in stock.  I've been hearing from friends that very few stores are stocking the Gold/White today and those are in very short supply (~5/store).   




 Been using Touch ID extensively for about 2 hours now since I've had to reload several 10's of apps.  The function is very accurate and responsive with the 4 fingers/thumbs I've used thus far.  I'm sold.  Can't wait until the API is provided to developers.  

One item I wasn't expecting is the passcode is still required after a restart.  




 The only way I was able to update was through the iTunes store.  OTA was just not working.  Note you need to first download iTunes 11.1 before downloading/installing iOS 7.

 The DJI Phantom is a good prosumer entry level quadcopter for very light weight cameras (e.g. GoPro).  To get decent arial footage, I recommend you get a gimbal to stabilize the image.  Although it's a bit of a hack, the Zenmuse H3-2D gimbal works well with the Phantom.  Realize that this can get expensive pretty quickly - what is your budget? 




 I'm guessing a rescue attempt of some type will be in the plot. 




 Although not confirmed by Apple, WSJ's AllThingsD has confirmed the Mavericks release. 

Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac reports, and AllThingsD has confirmed, that OS X 10.9 will not launch this month, but next.

WSJ/ATD is about as close to a confirmation as we'll get without an Apple confirmation.

 I'm not sure, but it may have to do with the presence of water/ice on Mars and the possibility of finding some evidence of life on Mars.  The chances of finding signs of life on Phobos would be much smaller.   




 Thank you.  I also think r/space is an **awesome** subreddit.   




 If you're referring to its odd shape, it's not Phobos' fault.  There is something called the "potato radius" above which objects in the universe become sufficiently massive to form a sphere.  That radius is ~200 km for icy objects and ~300 km for rocky ones.  Phobos has a radius of only 11 km, so it has no hope of becoming spherical.

 Isn't that the case with most things that are "discovered"?  I think the word has taken on a different meaning in these contexts. 




 This is a confirmation of an element that was initially discovered in 2003.  The element's temporary systematic IUPAC nomenclature is Ununpentium or Uup.  The element's name will change with its confirmation.

 Airplay is not related to networks so an "Airplay-app" doesn't make sense, unless I'm not getting your question.  Airplay is an Apple app supported by newer Macs and iOS devices that allows you to send whatever you are viewing on the device to your AppleTV and view it on your TV (known as mirroring).  

For older Macs that don't support Airplay, I use AirParrot ($9.99 US) to perform the same function. Doesn't perform quite as well as Airplay (likely due to running on an older Mac) but it gets the job done. 




 Why does it only have 2 stars in the App store?

 Good work kbuis. Thanks. 




 I hadn't heard about Bluetooth Low Energy technology until this article. As I was reading, it hit me: BLE would be perfect for the iWatch (or whatever Apple chooses to call their wrist-worn personal device).  This revelation assumes that Apple will not stream music from the iWatch or place other high data rate requirements on the device.  

Below are the paragraphs from the article that got me thinking:
The tradeoffs of choosing BLE over standard Bluetooth are that BLE only supports very low data rates, so you wont be streaming audio via BLE any time soon  but you can send small files if youre creative, and it works extremely well for small data packets sent from sensors.

Devices built with energy efficiency in mind can achieve battery lives of several years running off coin-cell batteries like the CR2540. This makes them ideal for wireless devices that stay in one place and would be annoying to recharge. 




 I just realized the last sentence is similar to the Wizard of Oz's message to the Scarecrow. 




 Yeah, that is what I would call a really bad day. 




 Yes, but if you're a Dexter fan, it's a big deal. This is how to encourage torrenting the show. 




 Fortunately we are in an area that also has FiOS.  We are switching in the next few days, not just because of this (which will be resolved soon I'm guessing) but because the up/download speeds are pretty snappy.

 Actually it is both.  The super-massive black hole is still there (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*), but there are additional postulated smaller black holes orbiting the big one.  




 Sounds a lot like what Tim Cook said to the U.S. Senate a few days ago. 




 Very close to the Newton.  The circular shape on the watch face would suggest the Newton.  But 1) the circle on the face in the ad is proportionally larger than the Newton's, 2) the watch face in the ad is missing the bezel that surrounds the Newton's watch face and 3) the watchband in the ad does not taper outward to match the size of the watch as the Newton's band does.  This looks like a 6th gen square nano with a different watch face applied, possibly for obscuration? 




 They actually play this song (and many others) and are accomplished harpists, although I'm sure this recording is "finger synched" given the environment they're in. 




 Yep, that's the problem - your density is way too low.  A neutron star has a density of between 3.710^17 and 5.910^17 kg/m^3, which is about 14 orders of magnitude higher than the density you're using.  The material about to compress into a black hole would have an even higher density than a neutron star. Try the neutron star density and see what radius you get. 




 Where did you get that density? 




 I'm not sure what density you assumed, but your radius looks way to large to be the minimum radius required to form a black hole.  You may have used the density of iron that we observe here on Earth.  However in the process of forming a black hole, iron atoms are highly compressed so that the nuclei are nearly in contact with each other.  This is a form of iron that is many orders of magnitude more dense than what we observe on Earth.  The much higher density allows the minimum radius for black hole formation to be much smaller than your estimate. 




 First time for me as well.  I looked for an original post but couldn't find one. 




 I'd say a pretty good production ... FROM FRICKEN SPACE! 




 I can only hope that was a joke. If so, good on ya.  If not, heaven (or what ever your belief) help you.

 That's look of minimalism. 




 That's pretty creative, except it violates one of the main design features of a manhole cover - they are usually circular so they cannot accidentally fall into the hole they're covering.  Any other shape, including this one I think, will allow the cover to fall into the hole if correctly (or incorrectly depending on your point of view) oriented.

 Good work sto-ifics42.  Are you an engineer by chance?
 




 Your eyes don't see ultraviolet (UV) light and this frequency is most damaging to your retina since there is much higher energy per photon. Yes the visible light (along with UV) from the sun is substantially dimmed by haze and reducing the time looking at the sun lowers the risk, but damage can be done to your eyes before you know it as the haze subtly clears. You might be safe but do you feel lucky?   




 You're walking a very fine line of safety with your eyesight. 




 Estes FTW!  I had many enjoyable launches and (more than I would like to admit) crashes using Estes rockets. The real crowd pleaser during my 7th grade rocket club was my Estes Saturn V rocket with 4 engines.  Unfortunately only two engines ignited, and even more unfortunately the ones that ignited were not diagonally opposed but adjacent engines.  The result was a launch that went from vertical to horizontal then started dipping downward, ending with a parachute ejection into the ground.  I will not forget the applause to this day and that was 44 years ago.

 Here's CNET's take on why the auction was terminated: 

http://www.cnet.com/news/alleged-iphone-6-prototype-ebay-auction-ends-with-no-sale/

TL;DR 
CNET speculates Apple asked for or demanded the return of the phone and the seller complied.  




 The "prototype iPhone 6" reached a peak bid of $100,100.  I revisited the site around 5 pm PDT on Oct 6 and the item was no longer available ... two days before the auction was to have ended. The seller must've pulled the phone off the market.  Sounds pretty suspicious. 




 Interesting, just went back to the site and the item is no longer available ... two days before the auction was to have ended.  Sounds like the guy pulled it off the market.  Sounds even more suspicious now.  




 And it took out Touch ID. 




 Yeah, I think 8.0.1 was the shortest lived iOS update in Apple history.

 After a little reading it appears the most currently favored cosmological model for the universe's expansion is the Lambda-CDM model where Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy dominate the energy-density of our universe (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model). This model appears to support observations that our universe's expansion is accelerating, although I can't determine what the model predicts for the end state of the universe, but it does not support a Big Rip as you indicated.  However, if the acceleration of the universe's expansion is left unchecked, it would appear the Lambda-CDM theory model is inconsistent with the theory proposed by Dr. Padilla and the resulting Big Crunch.  Am I missing something here? 




 I thought it was an interesting theory, but I'm dubious. The theory Dr. Padilla describes directly contradicts the generally accepted theory that the universe's expansion is accelerating and the end result will be a Big Rip (where even subatomic particles are torn apart due to the expansion of space) rather than a Big Crunch.

 This is a result of particle/wave duality.  Quantum theory says that energy carried by a field (or wave) can be broken down no further than its quantum component.  In other words, all fields have a corresponding minimum energy particle and vice versa.  It's like the difference between the electromagnetic field and the photon.  They're the same but exhibit field (wave) behavior or particle behavior depending on how they are observed.
