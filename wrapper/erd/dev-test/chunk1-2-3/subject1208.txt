 Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's kinda the fucking point. 




 Wait, why? Because other people are writing the material, or because no roast material will ever come close to what Kat had for Flava Flav? 




 Exactly what I thought. Running up to the big guy like "He's scared! He can't fuck with you, dude!" Probably going to be yammering away next to him for the rest of the day, pointing out other skinny kids: "You could take him, Mike! Is it cool that I call you Mike?" 




 Ugh. I mean, I get as much of a kick out of the fat acceptance movement as the next guy, but I sure as shit don't hate people for it. It's just flat out hilarious. "Look at me, I'm beautiful!" Ok sweetheart. Keep telling yourself that.  




 I had no idea we didn't like her. Quick, someone tell me why I should hate her too!

 When did the Marine Corps get involved? 




 Whaaat? I thought this was fucking fantastic! 




 EVERY GODDAMN TIME.

"Honey. Honey. Go gown on me."

"Have you showered?"

"Yeah of course."

*sniffs*

"Nope."

Damn you, ball sweat. 




 Yeah. That's why I consider it a very poorly executed good idea. 




 It depends on what kind of writing you want to do, but for most creative stuff you'd want to **start simple**. 

I started with American lit, Kerouac, Thompson, Twain etc. Their stories are accessible, entertaining, and well written. Diving straight into the REALLY good stuff, especially writers like Vonnegut, tends to discourage beginner writers because they are such masters of their craft they make it appear dead easy. So easy you think there's no way you could ever fucking come close it what they do. It's not easy. And if they had felt that way, they wouldn't be the writers they became. Writing is fucking masochistic when you get down to the nitty gritty, and the best writing will convey the exact opposite. I can't tell you the amount of times I've put down a book after reading a sentence and thought: "Well fuckit. Guess I'll be a teacher now."

After that, I'd say stick with writers that are generally praised for good writing. For masterclasses in novel writing, my top recommendations are Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, Lolita/Pnin/Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov, anything Dahl (seriously), Hero of a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell, Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut, and probably many more that I can't remember right now.

OH.

And A Farewell To Arms. Hemmingway. I have a first edition and it's far and away my favourite book. 




 This is great advice. Also, never ask a writer to edit. I was constantly asked to help with people's papers in college. The guys never took my suggestions seriously because it assaulted their pride, the girls just fucking cried.  




 In novel writing this would apply. Depends on whether you want to go down in history or make a buck. As a reporter, you're doing it for the history. You are providing your society with a fair and accurate account of events (ideally). You have no place in deciding what the people want. I've published a few big stories in my time and they've resulted in fundamental, tangible change for the better. But you can bet your ass I was dragged through the coals for it.  




 Definitely. I was a hockey goalie for a season. Lots of contact. LOTS of hate. Few things as satisfying as a sneaky slash to the back of a guy's calf as he's screening you. 




 I've found that this ESPECIALLY applies to writing on a deadline. In fact, writing on a deadline is where I learned this the most. "Don't be afraid to write a shitty lede." Chances are if you're writing on a deadline that requires such precision, you're already a good writer. So "shit" is relative. If I have to have 1800 words in quick, I disregard all thoughts of structure or my lede, parcel the story out, then arrange it in an informative and, hopefully, captivating structure. Then go through and tweak each paragraph so it has a smooth, logical flow.  




 That never worked for me. Personally I prefer to write sober, edit stoned. 




 Yes x1000000. He puts it way better than I do. I wrote a screenplay called "101 Banditos" in my teens. I shudder thinking about it. It was.... I can't. It was bad. Really bad. BUT. It was about a former slave turned bounty hunter in the wild west... Now I look at it as one of the best ideas I've ever had, just a very poorly executed one. 




 Hire an editor or bed a comp lit major. 




 Ehhhhh. I dunno. There's A LOT of shit out there you could do with avoiding. My mother comes to mind. 

Me: "Mom, have you read 50 Shades of Grey?"

Mom: "I don't have enough time to read crap, let alone 50 shades of it."
 




 I always loved it when a team had a good striker that I knew I had to be on point for. I suppose being made to score good goals is just as challenging and rewarding as being made to make good saves. 




 Me too......... How bout them Yankees? 




 I outline HEAVILY to avoid exactly this. I also smoke. And outlining and smoking go well together. 




 Nabokov's wife fished Lolita out of the trash. [I always defer to Ira when I hear this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbC4gqZGPSY)  




 You'd have to be a fucking moron to send something that reads like it's been written by one. The point is that you go back and make it better, ace. 




 Precisely! When I was in advertising, my boss wouldn't allow us to present an ad unless we had literally sketched out a thousand ads before it. He'd plop a fresh stack of printer paper in front of you and tell you to have drawn an ad on every sheet by lunchtime. The point isn't to sit around and think carefully about each ad. You scribble an idea as quick as possible and move on. Once you're finished, sift through the paper, pick out the best, repeat. 




 You're right. I wish that wasn't the case though. I had to read a lot of academic literature as a newspaper reporter and quickly realised I had no objective way of judging what I was reading. It was just too bogged down in a jargon I was totally unfamiliar with, and I didn't have the time to become familiarised. I think that's the problem with science and media right now. Neither industry makes much of an effort to communicate with each other in a way everyone will understand. The stuff that IS well communicated is usually the stuff scientists complain about getting stupid amounts of coverage.  




 Fun fact. My friend banged him in Vegas. 




  Pretty soon, you and your audience will like what you've written, as long as you have good taste.

FTFY

Pro writing tip #2: Read good shit. 




 I mean dont be afraid to write poorly. Don't worry about spelling mistakes (god knows F Scott Fitzgerald didn't. His editor was a goddamn saint for transcribing his scribble into books), finnicky grammar, poor sentence structure, insufficient conveyance of an idea. If it's slowing your progress, don't worry about it and move on. The most important aspect of writing is writing. Anything that stops that pursuit should be scythed off like a wart. 




 I've written professionally in television, newspapers, magazines, PR, and advertising for more than a decade. My number one piece of advice to writers (and this applies to all forms of writing, whether it's a cover letter on your CV, a college essay, or a novel) is don't be afraid to write like shit. 

Worrying over whether it's "good" or not is an exercise you save until you're done. Write an awful sentence. Shit, write an awful chapter. Mark it. Go back and change it later. 

This has served me better than any other writing tip I've ever come across.

EDIT: Do not write drunk and edit sober. Hemingway didn't do that, and besides, he's fucking Hemingway.

EDIT 2: Do what you want. I'm not sure I like the front page. Tis a silly place. 

EDIT 3: I'd love to respond to all the messages for advice and feed my ego, but the sausages popping in the kitchen are more appealing right now. Everyone asking for tips on how to get into writing, there's a reason that word is a gerund. Writing is something you do. Do it. If you don't know what to write, read. Simples. Stay gold, ponyboy.  




 All your mothers were seriously lax on manners. I'd get crucified for not greeting people properly. 




 Ah, so very true, but those were the greatest compliments! I'd get a half chub if a striker refused to shake my hand after the match. 




 As in players give keepers respect for good saves more than you might think. 




 Was a keeper through college. Nothing beats the satisfaction of this. Happened more than you'd expect. 




 I seem to remember hearing or reading somewhere that he had a writer for these kinds of speeches. Can any confirm or deny that? 




 That's exactly how the best interviewers do it. See: Robert Durst.  




 The all boy's middle school I went to would suggest otherwise. Nobody is stopping you and your buddies from gathering peacefully.  




 And now single! Hiyoooooooooo 




 Holy shit. Kenny vs Spenny.... now those are two names I've not heard in a long, long time. 




 Someone rang? 




 I had a one night stand the other night and once the willy came out the girl gives me this disappointed look and says: "I was told it was bigger." 

Long story short, there's a rumour going around that I have a large penis. I don't. Really not sure how to feel about it.  




 Well shit, that's a lot better than I usually get. Once was told I'm like an autistic Brad Pitt... 




 On YouTube, if anyone find my news presenting skills funny enough. I'm going to be a news anchor! Look out, Robin Scherbatsky!

 I have to get it cut in a few month for my new job (I'm gonna be on the tv!) Really, really not looking forward to it :( 




 It is fabulous, at times. Other times it's fabulously annoying. Dont get me started about driving with the windows down. 




 I will be the bouffant whore Reddit craves. Not because I want to. Because I have to. 




 Of course. But again, meet anybody involved in feminism beyond online flame wars and they'll agree men need better treatment in family court. I'd refer to RBG again on this issue.

...gender discrimination is bad for everyone. It also ends the stereotype of women as givers of child care and men as solely breadwinners. [We need to] tear down those barriers so a woman or a man could pursue whatever path in life they had the G-d given talent to pursue.

Also, it's "per se" not "say" 




 Also, a little teapot. Not that short. Kinda stout.  




 Fahd had just died and Abdullah was the regent. 




 I like the cut of your jib 




 Yissssssssssss. Fuck yeah TAL. 




 Seriously. Can we get a source on that? 




 Big props to the pastor. 




 I mean this in the kindest way possible, but please, try and reserve your opinions for when they are informed. I'm not from the US either, but I went to school there. One of my best friends is as gung-ho feminist as they come. She's a clinic defender, someone abortion clinics hire to help when people protest. What you see on the Internet is NOT feminists. They are people who talk about feminism. There's a big difference. Every gender studies, women studies major I've met has a firm understanding of the challenges men face and agree with me on all the standard MRA points. First wave feminism most certainly did not fix the outmoded gender stereotypes men face, just as it didn't do that for female gender stereotypes. I'd really encourage you to speak to real women who are actually on the ground doing feminist work rather than sitting on Tumblr complaining about cis male privilege.  




 Outmoded gender stereotypes? Have you ever met an actual feminist outside of Tumblr? RBG has done more for men in America than any other person. 




 My asshole dad refused to go to the doctor about his heart pains and died at 41 of a heart attack. Asshole. 




 What "right" has been taken away from you because of women? I'm genuinely curious. They are men's issues. They deserve to be discussed, absolutely, but the idea that women are leading the charge against us is retarded. 




 My boss would have thrown a book at me. Or whatever hard object is in his immediate vicinity.  




 Ugh. I wish I had an asshole dad. Well, any dad would be nice. 




 Only when my mother is pissing me off, for some reason. Usually though I just take it out on some fish or lobster. 




 It's really discouraging to see so many male-oriented subs go the way of women bashing. Even Men's Rights. I subbed because I thought we were going to discuss issues that effect men. Nope. It's a giant bitch fest about the women they all can't get. Even RP had an initial edginess to it, like you're approaching life as a predator. Nope. Bitch fest.

Can there be a sub for guys who like talking about guy things and have no problem with the women in their lives? Because right now I really don't think that exists. 




 I mean, that's pretty much how I react to stubbing my pinky toe. So I think mildly perturbed does it justice. 




 Hey. Let's not go allocating blame here. I think everyone is sorry, right? Right?  




 Anger and hatred? I'm mildly perturbed. That's all. 




 I... I'm sorry. I got a little heated. You said some things. I said some things. Let's put it behind us. 




 Your personal experience does not equal prejudice or racism. Prejudice is literally a preconceived notion based on ignorance.  




 EDIT: I have anger management issues. 




 What? C'mon now this is nonsense. I like the spirit of this sub. This is more RP crap.  




 Yep. Got detention as a kid for using it in that context. Didn't know it had an alternate meaning, so naturally the teacher wasn't too please I called him queer. 




 There's something oddly... non sexual about your pose. I have the most confused non boner. Awesome either way. 10/10. 




 Shut up, Scott. 




 I respectfully disagree. 




 Ah. So, like DBZ GT? 




 Yes, yes it is. Well done. And this is all from his wife, who has relayed it back to her uncle (my step dad) 




 Oh... Well I feel dumb. I thought the Star Wars stories went on, and these are just putting them into film form. 




 If I got the chance. They were supposed to come stay with us a few times now, but each time they cancelled because of filming etc.

From what I've heard, Adam starts out good, then turns bad, then becomes a Sith (I love Star Wars, just not that informed about it). Is that Kylo Ren's character arch?

 




 Just sharing what I heard. It's the talk of the whole company, obviously. 




 :( 




 I'm very curious to know how OP here has a pristine single page with an internet warning from the 90's... 




 I'm not saying a lower rate is a magic wand. I'd imagine you could marry a number of policies with it to incentivise companies into coming back to America, though. It's a pretty big subject for us in Bermuda, being a tax haven, and everyone's asshole gets a bit tighter around election time and we wonder what it would take for us to no longer be an attractive jurisdiction. And frankly, I don't think it would take much. Companies are far from peachy here. The IB environment has only just gotten friendly again after the ousting of the Progressive Labour Party in 2012, so we're seeing an uptick in new company registrations, but honestly myself and others really don't think it would take a whole lot to sink our economy and start floating yours. Take that as you will, I suppose. 




 There's nothing illegal about re-domiciling. That's why it's called a loophole.  




 Just the opinion of a guy living in the country where all your businesses domicile to avoid taxes, but I happen to think lowering the corporate tax rate would be the best way to start reeling in that lost tax revenue. They talk about closing the tax loopholes every election cycle and never do. Seems to me a good way to keep American companies paying taxes in America is to give them less reasons to domicile overseas.

 I prefer my women to be conscious when I disappoint them, thankyouverymuch 




 It was Halloween at Western University in London, Ontario, and my friends and I were hitting up an amazing burger join just outside of the bar we'd been drinking at. 

I go for a piss after ordering my food and find an apparently very drunk girl lying on the bathroom floor. I sit her up and try to get her talking, but all she keeps saying is "I hardly had anything to drink." She's pretty much incapacitated.

So I help her to her feet and get her out of the bathroom and sit her down at a table, then return to my friends and ask them what I should do. The logical choice was to help her into a cab, so I helped her back up again, walked to the street corner with her, and flagged down a cab.

Cab comes, but the girl is too far gone to even remotely remember where she lives and the cabbie refuses to take her. She manages to communicate to me that her house is on the road we're standing on and that she can point it out, but the cab driver still refuses to take her alone. 

A bit pissed, I get in the cab with her. She starts slurring about how she barely drank anything again, and then starts trying to kiss me, at which point it clicks that she's probably been drugged. I push her off me and she tells the cab driver to stop and that her house is right here. Cab pulls over, I go to pay him, and she bolts from the door and begins running down the sidewalk. "Ok awesome," I think. "I did my best." Nope. She stumbles and face-plants right into the concrete.

So I pick her ass up again, pretty frustrated with the whole situation at this point. She's bleeding from her forehead and yammering incoherently, but says her house is "right there." We get to the door and there's a party still going on inside. Her housemate answers the door, I tell him I "found her like this" and she fucking belts: "HE ROOFIED ME." Housemate clocks me in the nose before I can respond, sending me down the flight of stairs leading up to the door. Bang my head on the concrete. Housemate kicks me in the stomach, lays on a few more punches, and leaves me there.

Now drunk, concussed and bleeding from my nose, I make my way back to my res, find my resident advisor and go to the hospital.

I've never hated a slutty nurse so much in my goddamn life.

EDIT: Shout out to Western. You may remember me as the guy who ran around Saugeen with a boner, or that guy who unwittingly punched the stripper at the Beef Baron. Go Stangs.

EDIT 2: Ya'll motherfuckers need Jesus. Where I'm from, we help people in need of help. Yes it was dumb to get in the cab. GEE, THANKS. I know I fucked up. That's why you're reading this, turdblossom.

 Was the effect of 'yellow journalism' such that it truly convinced a nation -- that valued freedom above all else -- that they were justified in taking freedom away from others? 














 Court reporter here. Was speaking with a lawyer and he was telling me about the time he had to represent someone accused of having sex with a horse. "Did anyone ask why THAT horse, instead of any of the others?" I asked.

"Actually yes," replied the lawyer. "He wanted a stable relationship." 



















 Had an argument with my boss one morning. Was working in broadcast journalism and had set up a series of interviews with politicians to respond to a major story that broke over night. Except that those interviews I set up were being handed to someone else and instead she told me I had to go and talk to orphans and ask them how the economy was effecting them. I laughed, and said "No, Gary can do the orphan story, I'll do MY story, thankyouverymuch." At which point she launched into a tirade, belittling me and basically speaking to me like she was my mother. This has happened a bunch of times. I hung up and texted her. "Please don't speak to me like that again or I will have to quit." I got an immediate response: "Your fired." I was gutted. But as I looked at my phone again, a wry smile creeped across my face and my thumbs went into action....

*you'RE

We haven't spoken since.

**EDIT:** I suppose I should add that I was at my wick's end (EDIT EDIT: FINE. "WITS' END" YOU GLORIOUS PEDANTS) with the company and her as my editor. She was extremely unprofessional. What made this argument special was that she constantly told me I was not delivering enough stories of my own, that she was setting up too many interview for me. Naturally once I start doing this, she hands the best interviews of the day, set up by yours truly, to the chief reporter-- who has stopped talking to me after she handed one of HIS interviews to ME-- and sends me to do some filler about the economy. She was eventually fired and I have since been offered my job back. Twice. 
























 Frankly I think us men should no longer hide our erections in public. For too long now our erections have been oppressed by belt buckles and between our thighs, hurriedly tucked away lest anyone sees. Man will not truly be free until he can be proud of his erection, not ashamed and embarrassed! We get them all the time, for many reasons besides arousal. If a 'liberated' woman can walk around with hard nipples reading 50 Shades of Shit, why can't I walk around with a hard penis? I envision a new era, where penises are not judged by size or breadth or stamina, but valued as utilitarian assets-- a world where, when I get a boner on the train, I can stand with my erection proudly as a free man... 
























 I'm puzzled too. It was at +10 one second. The next it was at -14. Either way, I'll happily take the downvotes on behalf of /r/motorcycles. I don't know a single rider that isn't extremely cautious with their driving. I ride to avoid traffic, but I also ride for the exhileration. At no time do I mesh those two desires. If I want to satisfy my craving for [power](http://www.instantclarkson.com/) I go to a long stretch of empty road near the airport where I live. I even dated a girl that loved the whole motorcycle thing and pissed her off every time she rode with me because she wanted to go fast and I refused.  




 Spot on. I've had a handful of crashes, all but one of them have been because of someone else in a car. The one that wasn't, I ran over a nail that popped my tyre. I've got a theory that a lot of road accidents could be avoided by less restrictive speed limits, and the same logic applies to riding vs driving. In a car it's easy to switch off because of the feeling of security a car provides. If you're on a bike, you're acutely aware that you could go flying 50 feet in the air and land in a ditch if anyone makes a wrong move. Now who is going to be the more cautious driver? 




 On behalf of bikers everywhere, we know. The last thing the majority of riders need is a lecture on their own mortality. The majority of us are respectful and safe.

 I was more thinking of the post where OP used his dead father's last fiver to get a beer when he was legal. It was just a picture of a beer and a fiver, but as someone who lost their father as a teen, I appreciated the post. Begging for donations is different.

 Was in an emotionally abusive relationship for a while. Got out of it when I realized things weren't getting better. Turned out the entire time we were dating she was living undiagnosed with MS, which played a big part in her craziness level. Anyways, this won't be a popular opinion, but I think it takes a particularly weak person to internalise the emotional abuse they're getting. Both men and women. I couldn't ever take a word she said seriously because she was so clearly trying to say the most hurtful thing she could imagine. Why would you give a person like that the time of day? Why let their comments affect you? It never made sense to me.

 Drug treatment courts for non violent drug offenders are some of the most effective courts in the world. Their recidivism rates are miniscule.

 Building a stadium that gives your team an advantage over the visitor is standard practice among most sports. A lot more of the new stadiums in English football do this, not to mention everything they do with the pitch to get an advantage. Also, it's not against the rules. You can't get busted for smoking weed then point out the guy that's drunk and say what he's doing is worse.

 Yeah, it's way too friendly. She's putting up fliers though.

 I think Reddit is far past masquerading as anything other than what it is: the most influential website in the world. This happens with a lot of cultural movements, of which Reddit can certainly qualify. They start out with upstanding value systems that people gravitate toward. But the more people gravitate, the harder it becomes to uphold those ideals. Reddit gets more and more popular, requiring more and more money. In order to keep making that money to service the users, values are sacrificed. Goes for political parties, religions, you name it. I'm disappointed but wholly unsurprised. 




 This is my friend's business! Big up Evan! 




 Sorry, but no. Boston. 




 I dont know of many F1 drivers that haven't practiced from an early age.... 




 Thanks. Definitely going on my letter to Santa.  




 Bermuda, the land of pastel shorts, pink beaches, and nonexistent triangles.

That's pretty much what I had in mind. This is in the far off future, mind you. There's no way I could afford flying out to a driving school any time soon. 




 No, unfortunately. Her apt complex doesn't allow pets :( 




 THAT I can understand. Obligatory brush with death story:

 My days riding 50cc scramblers saved my life a few years back. I was going too fast around a blind corner and there was a van parked in the road. I swerved to avoid it but another car was coming in the opposite direction. I hit the brakes hard, locking up my rear which put the bike sideways, skidding straight toward the car. The moment I realized I was going to hit it head on, I let go of the rear brake and the bike popped up and straightened out, grazing the driver's side of the car and sparing my life. 




 Oh dear god no. Definitely not planning on jumping straight into an F1 car. I want to take a proper course and everything. And yes, I drive every day, but only ever under 60kph in beat up Opel Astra. Doesn't exactly hone your driving sense.  




 Unfortunately not. I live on a 21 square mile island where the speed limit is 50kph. Having a burp in an F1 car is high up on my bucket list though. I'm dying to know if I have the balls to give it some real welly.  




 Alonso might disagree there. Or Stirling Moss........ 




 That makes a lot of sense. Sounds similar to MotoGp. I guess what's tripping me up is just a general lack of knowledge for how it feels going fast on four wheels. I've always gotten my kicks on two.  




 I feel like that's probably a good thing. I've only ever seen a fedora worn well in magazines.  




 ? am I missing something? 









 Looks like he's about to dingle his dangle on the rim... 




 I used to be SUPER into swords as a kid. Went to Toledo for them and everything. I still fucking love swords, but man oh man have neckbeards ruined them for me. 




 mother of god. what tard kard put this report together? 




 Journalist here. Same thing applies, although it's not so much crying over really horrific shit, more the slow, painful realization as you slip deeper into the rabbit hole of life that nothing is going to change, and there's nothing you can do about it. That said, we do see some pretty awful road fatalities. I didn't think journalism would teach me what a kneecap looks like. 




 They were actually the OG truthers. Well, them and the sinking of the Maine. We've just forgotten about that particular conspiracy theory. 




 Exactly. I never understood this about fans wanting athletes to be upstanding moral paragons of sportsmanship. Players dive. They flop. They do anything they can to win. It's up to the people making the rules to ensure the integrity of the game is maintained despite this.  




 I mean... That's kinda exactly how America started

 Same goes for writers! 




 DEAR GOD. How did it get there???? 




 How is Sir David's mortality a problem? Really? You don't see the problem there? 




 Ya'll need to learn how to bullshit better if you're typing single words in at the end of sentences. Wow. 




 Ooooooooh dat thudding doe. Jesus.  




 It got a decent "heh" out of me. 




 There is a huge fucking difference. Words are just a fraction of the ways we communicate. 




 I'm the same way. I saw a thread about a guy wanting to commit suicide the other day and my first instinct was: "What a cunt, posting that online. I should go tell him to do it". I didn't, but I still wanted to... that's disturbing to me 




 Can confirm.

Signed, a criminally charming hobo. 




 If you'd like to boil it down to which measurement is used the most, I'd be willing to bet the entire trade and commerce industry might beat out the average number of Americans.  




 Now you just need to have JJ block a field goal... Good luck 




 Remind me how a few movie stars worth millions of dollars asking for my money to make another movie is important? 




 Fun fact: the "official" system of measurement in the US is actually metric.

EDIT for clarity: the metric system is "the Preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce". 




 The fact that she, armed with only a bachelor's degree in early childhood education, took over an entire magazine when her husband died suddenly, and not only kept the business afloat but managed to cut all our debt, rebrand the magazine, launch four more magazines, publish 12 books, find the most awesome, caring, creative man to love, and raise two kids all at the same time. She also rips mad bongs. Mom's an OG4Lyf.  
























 Hey fuck you, buddy. Who died and made you Conductor of Assumption Junction, eh? Society dictates what's "normal" or not. I mean, sure, there's the whole thing about normality being established by statistical representation of sex and gender identity, but the implication is you're calling non cis NOT normal, and that's mean. Also accurate. BUT MEAN. 




 I really wish there was a large group of black people watching this go down. I'd pay handsomely for that commentary. 




 So... WERE YOU THERE FOR HER? 




 Was waiting to read this. Former court reporter here. Cameras are shown to have a significant impact on the judge's sentencing. Doubly so considering judges are elected in America, leaving them prone to handing down harsher sentences to please the public.

 Am I the only one that would like to see confirmation that this is OP's mom? 




 FUCK. THAT. NOISE. 

My balls just retreated quicker than an arctic glacier on rollerskates. 




 I'd have to be certain I had something worth saying. Otherwise you're just asking to be haunted by the disapproving gaze of the president of the united states the rest of your life. "Yeah, I met the President," you'll tell your grandkids, trying your best to forget the way his eyes belied precisely how disappointed he was that you were even in the room. 




 The fuck is everyone angry at then?  




 Yeah. Only a fucking moron or a genius would speak up during something like that. I'm the loudest cunt in the room 90% of the time but you couldn't get me to give my thoughts in a situation like that in a million years.

EDIT:[ Thank you.](http://i.imgur.com/86etTSn.gif) 




 Wait. Really? Did a gay couple ask them to cater, or did they just say they wouldn't cater gay weddings? Maybe I run with a different crowd, but a pizza place announcing they're not going to cater a gay wedding is a bit like me announcing I'd rather not make out with the hottest girl in school. 




 That's precisely what I meant by "solution". Apologies that it came off differently, I agree 100%. My point was that the public doesn't understand that the "solution" to addiction is in mitigation, not eradication, and that our current way of dealing with the problem only ends up costing everyone more money and ruining more lives.  




 Very much so. The most interesting aspect of drug treatment court for me was that it's more like a therapy session. I'm of the opinion that if you enjoy using drugs, you should be free to do so until your drug use infringes on the rights of others. That's when your addiction becomes a problem for the state and community to address (although that's not to say it shouldn't be addressed sooner). I'm a big advocate for the "it takes a village" approach. 




 Cassie???? 




 I appreciate it, but I'm only a conduit doing its job. Covering such stories is to my benefit. It just so happens that what benefits me also benefits the public. It's impassioned people such as yourself that really need to be thanked. Without people like you I wouldn't have a story to write. 




 Funny you mention it. I'm looking at Ross Perot's cigarette boat "Blue Thunder" as I write this. 




 It's actually astounding how much push back there is to the idea that sticking a badger in a cage is the best way to make it nice. Alongside the public perception of addiction, I think Americas biggest difficulty will be taking capitalism out of the prison system without plangent screams of "socialism" from the right. We've already seen how hard it is to take capitalism out of health care.

EDIT: clarity 




 Weird. The religious people I know are some of the most positive, genuine, and selfless people I know. I'm as athiest as they come, but still... 




 I've reported on the rehabilitation of non-violent drug offenders for a while now. Was given unprecedented access into a drug treatment court, which is not open to the public or press. Wrote a solid 15+ articles on the subject for my country's national daily paper. Was interviewed by a PhD student studying the same thing for their dissertation. Was thanked profusely by the lawyers involved in the process (who are some of the most genuine lawyers I've ever met). Basically, everyone who knew anything about the subject was super stoked that it was getting coverage, and a lot of it.

Every article I wrote received little to no attention. The comments came in on the web version were derisory, often along the lines of: "Yeah, I'd fake being 'rehabilitated' as well if it meant getting out of jail."

I can't speak for other nations, but to me the problem is clearly with the public's perception of drug addiction. There is still the prevailing mentality that people do this to themselves, and they get what they deserve. Up until those articles I was as gung-ho about drug reform as you could get. After seeing how much the public actually cares, I've lost every last bit of optimism. My only hope is that enough countries begin taking such approaches, so countries like mine can see just how powerful this kind of rehabilitation can be.

 Betty probably said the same thing about her dog. 




 I've seen it matter firsthand working in a single industry for more than 10 years. You're not even out of high school.

There are times when diversity can be of value, and times where it's not needed. Saying point blank it doesn't matter just shows a total lack of understanding when it comes to workplace dynamics. 




  ...placing diversity over skill is clearly counter-productive to the bottom line.

How you managed to interpret the exact opposite of what I said is a miracle.

My point was only that diversity can be a positive thing when it's not prioritized above skill. 




 Why not? Having a gender diverse workplace is shown to have a number of advantages. If you have two equally skilled male and female candidates in a workplace that is largely comprised of men, there are plenty of reasons for why the female candidate would be a better option.  




 Not to be contrarian, but [workplace diversity does have its advantages.](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/workplace-diversity-can-help-bottom-line-1007)

Obviously, placing diversity over skill is clearly counter-productive to the bottom line. 




 Probably risks having the whole cave collapse... 




 "Skeets Miller" is possibly the best journalist name ever. 




 Glad to see this sub going back to its roots. That "bathrooms should be pull to enter, push to exit" nonsense rustled my jimmies a bit too much.

 Rolling Stone is hardly the first magazine to put a terrorist on the cover.

 Solid plan. Let's run with it. 




 I didn't realize /r/showerthoughts had become /r/commonsense  




 Spot on. No idea why I keep clicking on the comments section. This is the ONLY time it's ever paid off. 




 We need more women like you commenting in this sub. Dear lord that would be so refreshing. Like a paper daisy on a cum-stained corkboard. 




 One of the few times I'm glad I got the titties 




 It was piss my pants or dash for the bathroom. I chose wrong. And yeah, they sell beer inside the stadium but you cant bring it with you to your seat. Hence the chugging. 




 Nah, Essien's famous screamer against Arsenal in 07/08.  




 He was far and away my favourite player, which made it all that much worse. But yeah, he was crucial for us for so many years. Won't ever forget the Ess Express and his love for naps. 




 I know. It'd be like having an Army badge as well as a Green Beret badge.  




 Whenever I watch a game with the English side of my family and we go down a goal, they all tell me to go take a piss so we can score. Its worked a solid number of times actually.

 Not a hope in hell that is Courtois' fault. Jog on. 




 LOL a bedpan? With that kind of money I could just pay someone to piss in their mouth. 




 You try holding it in after chugging as many beers as possible before the whistle.  




 What kind of ham did you use? And it better have been whole wheat bread. Hovis, preferably.  




 You know nothing. 

My first Chelsea game I went to take a piss. Walked up the stairs back to my seat and the crowd goes nuts.

 I didn't know "heads up" was shitting on someone 




 Ugh. Yeah, that's the ticket. 




 Oh man. I saw these chicks in London and this song had me DYING. I want to marry them both. So glad they're making it big time. Only person to make me laugh that hard at a show was John Stuart doing stand up.

(If anybody has a clip of his closing act, where he talks about trying to fuck his wife while his dog is puking outside his bedroom door, that would be great) 




 Live in one of the world's largest green turtle sanctuaries. Our country has protected them since the early 1800s. Not sure where you are, but where I'm from this picture would get you in shitloads of trouble. Highly illegal to even catch them. Just a heads up. 




 I think it's pretty fucking stupid that Jesus needed to roll a giant rock out of the way to escape the tomb when he has teleportation powers, but you bet your ass I'll be chompin down on some candy bunnies this weekend.  




 HA! Thanks for pointing that out. 




 I posted this same TIL to Archer a while back. Most people on the thread pointed out Hiroo probably wasn't the guy as there were lots of "hold outs." 




 Not really, no. So just putting it out there. Bring me a puppy, you've got yourself a free stay at Chateau du Weiner!  




 I mean... it doesn't HAVE to be an aussie. How hard would it be to get a puppy to Bermuda? I am so down for this trade 




 Ummmmmm that can definitely be arranged

 It is. Fun fact about the house: Adam Driver married my cousin 2 summers ago on the front lawn. 




 The racism in this thread disgusts me. Clearly this woman is hedgehogkin. 




 If puppies result you've got yourself a free week at [my rental cottage](https://www.flipkey.com/sandys-cottage-rentals/p522705/) in Bermuda in exchange for one.

 Wait. Who is Alex? 




 Why even bother? Or are you that much of tool to think you can get laid because a girl posted a picture of herself? 




 Far crazier things have happened... 




 I have no idea what's going on, but clearly you've ruined it. Thanks. 




 Wait... did they recently release an album that sold like 4 copies in Australia? 




 That's because you can't get in trouble for saying two grown ups had sex. Try saying a major celebrity fucked a 14 year old and see how that goes down with their lawyers 




 That's my cousin. 




 This is PRECISELY how I feel after missing an easy birdie. 




 The ONE link I click on thinking it might be real. Fuck you OP. I had the biggest freedom chub and you ruined it. Thanks. 




 wasn't just for you. I've had a few messages and there are other similarly themed comments to yours 




 Yeah... I get that my comment came across that way. But there are a lot of circumstances to my personal relationship and how it ended that has resulted in me being a lot more judicious with who invest myself emotionally in. No sense going into them, this isn't /r/relationships, but for clarity's sake it's not my trust in women that has gone specifically, it's the realization that the person I choose to give myself to wholeheartedly can at any given moment turn around and leave me with my dick in the wind. I doubt that person would ever be a man, so it's not a leap to say that relationship has left me wary of any woman I should want to spend my life with. 




 Mixed, but close enough. 




 Go ahead and check my post history. I'm all for remaining with England because of the advantages it offers us. Carry on. 




 Spoken like a true member of the Empire.

Since you clearly can't pick up on colloquialisms like "readins", I guess I have to explain.

Bermuda was settled by people on their way to settle in America. Therefor anti-British sentiment was strong circa 1775, since many of the people fighting in the Revolutionary War (sorry, "The War Of Independence" in your parlance) had close ties to Bermuda. Famous figures like John Rolfe, for example, had been wrecked in Bermuda (he even named his child with Pocahontas "Bermuda Rolfe.")

Seeing as those who settled in Bermuda did so for the same reasons the colonists settled in Virginia, it's only natural that they would side with their American brothers and sisters in their fight to gain independence.

Subsequently, we have attached our own dollar to the American dollar, become the darling of your biggest corporations, and underwritten the majority of your insurance. We are the oldest self governing colony in the British Empire, and have made shaky steps towards independence on a number of occasions, each push ultimately failing because no longer being a part of Britain would deprive us of valuable education and work opportunities both in the UK and the wider EU.

But what do I know, I'm just a Bermudian journalist with more than a decade worth of experience and research into Bermudian history to draw from.  




 It was more savage than that. Literally stopped responding to me when I lost my job.  




 Fuck. It's not a joke when this has actually happened to you. Completely erased my trust in women

EDIT: the women I have intimate relationships with. Obviously not all women. You don't get hit by a car then not pay more attention the next time you cross the road.  




 Found the professional comedian everyone 




 My sisters are good friends with him. Went to school together. He's hilariously self deprecating.

 IIRC that picture was photoshopped or taken at a totally different time to the hurricane. Did they actually, or was that just more Facebook bullshit? 




 Well Muslims born and raised in the west usually ARE like every other muslim. Regular people.

The media is responsible for a lot of things, not least of which is the total confusion over what is going on within Islam right now. You're right in that it's helped spread xenophobia and racism and prejudice. I totally agree. You're right in that plenty of other religious groups have practiced the exact same things from time immemorial.

But Islam is in the middle of a massive ideological battle right now that is spilling over, costing hundreds of thousands of lives. Should talking heads be wondering on national television if the guy was a muslim? Of course not, if there's nothing to suggest that. Of COURSE that is wrong.

Is it prejudiced to wonder if a muslim who has carried out a violent attack was doing so in the name of Islam? No, because prejudice is by definition a pre-conceived notion not based on actual experience. If 20 people have been bitten by sharks off of one beach all summer, and a body washes up with chunks taken out of it, you're going to assume a shark did it.

EDIT: #notallsharks 




 1 + X = 2. Assuming X = 1 is not exactly rash.

It's not prejudicial to assume that if a Muslim commits an act of mass murder, especially in the West, it's usually in the name of ideology. And when it comes to killing people with planes, it's not like there isn't a history. It's irresponsible to use a label such as terrorist without knowing the motive, absolutely, but questioning whether an act of violence was ideologically motivated these days is only natural. 

Just to be clear, I lived for three years with kids from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. Some of the best friends I ever had. I'm not trying to shit on Muslims. Hell, the most devout Muslims I met were the most morally upstanding people I have ever come across.
 




 I'm one of those people. Worked in journalism from 16 onwards. Went to college. Realized in my first month that it would be way more beneficial to stay in the industry for three years instead of spending money on getting a 3-yr degree. Going to get my masters next year, and the newspaper I work for is paying for it! 




 I think you misread my comment. I wasn't saying that. And it's not just a dick on a motorcycle that thinks this.
