  there isn't a separate "Conclusions" section like you are implying

You seem to have skipped the first page of the [2000 CDC report](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf). The Conclusions section is on pg. 836, 1st column, 5th paragraph. The quote that ""other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates" comes from the Conclusions section on pg. 836 and not from the Discussion section on pp. 838-840. I am quoting directly from the lead sentence of the Conclusions section, so I have trouble seeing how that is a distortion of the "conclusions" from the Discussion section.

 How does that not suggest that they are more dangerous than "any other breed"?

Yes, it suggests that pit bulls can be dangerous (because they kill consistently each year). Yes, it suggests that they are more dangerous than **some** other breeds (because their fatalities are disproportionate to their breed population). No, it does not suggest that they are more dangerous than **any** other breed, which is why the conclusions of the report include that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates." This is clearly explained in the lead paragraph of the Discussion section:

 Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.

I've already quoted this explanation in an earlier comment, but you seem to have trouble grasping why this definition of relative dangerousness negates your assertion (or you're willfully ignoring a basic principle of Statistics 101). So, let me put it into concrete numbers to demonstrate how it leads to the CDC's conclusion that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates" and contradicts your assertion that "they are more dangerous than any other breed."

* Breed X = Husky

* Breed Y = pit bull

* Breed X fatal attacks = 21 (Table 2 from CDC report)

* Breed Y fatal attacks = 76 (ibid.)

* Breed X population = 1.0% ([source](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf))  68M ([source for dog population in 2000](http://www.statista.com/statistics/198100/dogs-in-the-united-states-since-2000/)) = 0.7M

* Breed Y population = 6.7% (ibid.)  68M = 4.6M

So, the CDC's argument in concrete terms becomes the following:

 Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 21 fatal attacks by Huskies relative to a population of 0.7 million Huskies (30.0/million) implies a greater risk than 76 attacks by pit bulls relative to a population of 4.6 million pit bulls (16.5/million). Without consideration of the population sizes, pit bulls would be [incorrectly] perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.

Does this concrete example using the CDC's fatality numbers make more clear why *some* other breeds is accurate but *any* other breed is inaccurate?

 leads you to disregard the best available statistics in favor of willfully blind and frivolous pit bull advocacy

The best available statistics are those described by the CDC in the lead paragraph of their Discussion section, which leads to the lead sentence in their Conclusions section. Why do you choose to willfully ignore the best available statistics as described by the CDC and instead apply your own *ad hoc* statistics to raw data buried in the middle of the Discussion section so as to reach a conclusion that's directly contradicted by the CDC?

 You are behaving in a way that has been documented to be typical of owners of "outlaw" breeds such as Pit Bulls.

I am not an owner of a pit bull. I am an owner of an "outlaw" breed only if Dachshunds are classified as such. [Here are my reddit posts of my four wiener dogs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dachshund/search?q=author%3Atrain_subject2472 restrict_sr=on) I am a dog lover and a research scientist specializing in the area of risk assessment, so my mind is clouded with bias on this issue only in the sense that I consider myself an expert in one particular aspect.

 even worse is your post on /r/TheGentlePitbull

Please look more carefully at my comment threads about the same report that were posted on a different sub. I do not find the study compelling because breed was eliminated from the analysis due to large discordance between eye witness identifications, animal control reports, and police reports. I felt that the discordances should have been resolved (rather than thrown out) and that breed should have been included in the multivariate analysis. I emailed the principal author (Prof. Pastronek) suggesting as much and would be happy to share his responses with you by PM. 




 I never suggested that the CDC didn't find any evidence that pit bulls are dangerous. [I said](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/30xla3/if_my_son_so_much_as_cries_he_rushes_in_to_save/cpxgs58) that the CDC didn't find any "evidence that pit bulls are inherently **more** violent than any other breed" (emphasis for clarity). I don't see it as inconsistent or disingenuous to believe that pit bulls can be dangerous while also believing that they may be less dangerous than other breeds.

 it is bizarre and confusing that you are focusing on the statement that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates"

I'm focusing on that specific statement because it directly contradicts your ([implied](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/30xla3/if_my_son_so_much_as_cries_he_rushes_in_to_save/cpxe6xa)) assertion that the CDC report is "evidence of [pit bulls] being more inherently violent than any other breed." 

 and not statements from the same report such as:

I don't think that it's bizarre or confusing to focus on the lead sentence of the Conclusions section rather than a paragraph buried in the middle of the Discussion section. Using your example statement from the Discussion section, the CDC researchers go on to indicate that the "breed-specific problem" might not be due to inherent dangerousness but might instead be due to sex (pg. 839, 1st column, 4th paragraph), to reproductive status (ibid.), to breed popularity over time (pg. 839, 2nd column, 1st paragraph), etc. If one focuses on individual parts of the Discussion section, then it can be easy to take those parts out of context and fall prey to confirmation bias. By contrast, the Conclusions section summarizes the totality of the research, not just piecemeal parts, and is less likely to suffer from bias (imho).

 casual disregard for basic statistical analysis

What basic statistical analysis am I disregarding? It's the CDC, not me, that looked at fatality fractions and instead suggests that fatality rates are a better method to quantify relative dangerousness. It's the CDC, not me, that looked at "several interacting factors [which] affect a dogs propensity to bite." These are basic principles of statistical analysis used in risk assessment (base rates, univariate vs. multivariate models) which I appreciate that the CDC did not disregard in reaching their conclusions.

 Would you please voluntarily step down from your position?

Feel free to bring this to the attention of my fellow mods on /r/science as evidence that I should be disqualified from their ranks. I think I'd greatly enjoy defending my support of the CDC's risk assessment methodology and conclusions. Here's a link to get you started:

 You're right, the 2000 CDC report doesn't prove there is no evidence, only that one particular group of researchers didn't find any evidence 15 years ago. However, the problem is that /u/Good_timesd didn't cite the CDC in support of his argument; rather, **you** cited the CDC in support of **your** counter-argument. And that's why I'm confused. How does the CDC report constitute evidence that pit bulls are inherently more violent than any other breed when one of their conclusions is that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates?" 




 They reach the opposite conclusion (emphasis for clarity):

 Although fatal attacks on humans appear to be a breed-specific problem (pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers), **other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates**.

Bite rate and fatality rate are equated with relative dangerousness by the CDC researchers on pg. 838 of the report:

 Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.

In other words, the CDC researchers concede that pit bulls are responsible for a greater number of fatalities but indicate there is no evidence that they're responsible for a greater fatality rate, i.e., there's no evidence that they're inherently more violent. This supports /u/Good_timesd's statement that there's "no evidence of them being more inherently violent" and not your statement that it's "completely false." 




 I'm confused why you cite the [2000 CDC report](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf) as evidence that pit bulls are inherently more violent than any other breed when the researchers reach the opposite conclusion. Are you sure that you didn't intend to cite a different study?

 The format for the MIT News Office press releases is to put relevant links in the right-hand sidebar just underneath the headline. The right-hand sidebar includes links to the paper ([The precedence of syntax in the rapid emergence of human language in evolution as defined by the integration hypothesis](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00271/abstract)), the author ([Shigeru Miyagawa](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/miyagawa/)), the MIT lab ([Linguistics](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/index.html)), and the MIT department ([21](http://shass.mit.edu/)).

 The quote is from the 2nd paragraph of the *JAMA Pediatrics* editorial and is a summary of a CDC report from January 2015, which is Reference 1 listed at the end of the article. The quote is *not* a summary of the rest of the article, which focuses primarily on Reference 2, authored by Fontanella *et al.* and published this month. As such, the title is not an appropriate summary for the submission.
