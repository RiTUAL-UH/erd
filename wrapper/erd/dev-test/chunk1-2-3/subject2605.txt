 Is your friend on Reddit? You mentioned it was inspired by depression, which is the main reason I like it; I have clinical depression, too. I'd like to know the story behind it if he's comfortable sharing.  









 Might become a tattoo of mine.  




 Want. Where can I find it? 




 "Look! One's an innie and one's an outie!" -family guy 









 you're* 









 I want one! 




 She's not in the kitchen. 




 The pic reminds me of AC3. 




 Why is this a thing?! 









 I'll allow it. 
























 Mine is an 08. 














 Your friend, sir, is a bad ass. 









 Congrats man stay strong! 




 I'm so sorry for your loss.  









 I'm 27. Legend of the hidden temple was a popular gameshow for kids in the early/mid 90s. 




 As someone who comes from an entirely Jewish family, I just want to say thank you. 














 Captain Power and one of his nemeses (whose name I cant remeber...lord dread, maybe?) 




 Yeah I'm on medication. It took years to figure out what worked. But life is pretty good now. I hope your friend gets the help he needs. Tell him I'm rooting for him. I'll definitely let you know if I get his drawing as a tattoo. Does he have any other drawings? 









 You are truly a saint. 
























 I feel your pain. 




 I'm glad someone else has seen this commercial. I thought I was going crazy. This is by far the creepiest commercial I've ever seen thigh. 




 Haha I noticed the toy in the background after I posted the pic. It's part of a toy phone. 














 I'm sure I could find a few. They have all kinds of outdated tech hiding around the house. 









 I want one of those! 









 You should post this in r/earthporn 




 Well excuse me. I only use Reddit on my phone, and am still fairly new to it, so I'm not boned up on the etiquette. 














 @angrybane: yep, in a parking garage 









 ZING!
