 trust us we arent encouraging anything, just a simple equation of supply and demand. if you think golfers arent smoking on the course than you have your head deep in the bunker! fore20 




 i wouldn't want to debate which is better, however they are different. the pitch n puff is cheap $10, brass (making it indestructible), and as you say has a novelty appeal. I take a clean one wherever i travel and leave it there, cant do that with a vap and wouldent want to with anything but a cig bat, but the pitch n puff has a much bigger bowl than a bat... try one out and let us know. fore20
