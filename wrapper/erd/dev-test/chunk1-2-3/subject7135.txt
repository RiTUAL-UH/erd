 Can confirm; I have the same phone.

My one has a full 1gb free on its SD card, but keeps tricking itself into thinking it's full, blocking messages coming in and stopping me from using Facebook and the like. I would probably get more use out of a slice of cheese some days. 









 Hey,guys. 

I recently read the post on r/askreddit about advice for writing and realised that I may have been pretty lazy in my writing so far, so I was wondering if anyone could tell me how sloppy my writing has gotten and also give any general feedback on mood/characterisation. It's at ~15,000 words at the moment, so I'm about 6 or so chapters in.

Thanks in advance :D

 Can I come,too? 




 But there's.....p-people there. Real people. I don't think I can cope with all those people who aren't me walking around.  




 Is an Australian Shepherd another name for a Coolie? That dog looks a hell of a lot like a Coolie. 




 A man goes to pass some arse-turnips,but realises there's no toilet paper. He is also on a bus. 




 I'll try to get my hands on some, I know he has a few floating around somewhere. 




 Proof to him working on the Matrix. Figured I might as well try to get some semblance of legitimacy to my claim. I can't prove that that is actually my dad without revealing too much personal information, so you're gonna have to take my word for it. Given that this is the internet, I'm not surprised if you don't believe me. 




 Didn't stop him from kicking in a wardrobe on set. My dad tells me he had a tantrum and kicked in his wardrobe door. My dad had to fix it.

 If you're up for some Chiv or Natural Selection,add me on Steam: dimitricatnikov 




 I'd like to go but is it too late to get a pass? 




 Sweet. Starmade is Mac-compatible, I think. 
[Starmade.org](http://star-made.org) Should say whether it is or not. 




 My name's Raphael,too! I don't have Civ V or portal,but I do have Minecraft and Starmade if you want to play. Starmade's free and a shitload of fun if you don't have Minecraft. 




 Hey, guys. I've been suffering a fairly large bout of depression recently and was hoping I could kickstart my love of gaming again as I've lost enjoyment of it. If anyone is up for some Chivalry, Minecraft, Starmade or any other multiplayer game that we both own, I'd be more than happy to add them on Steam. My Steam id is dimitricatnikov. 




 It'd be good to meet other gamers with depression.If anyone's up for some Chivalry,Minecraft or Starmade my steam id is dimitricatnikov. 




 Fucking awesome,man! Thanks heaps,you actually got really  close to how I imagine her. :) 




 That's fine,whatever is easiest. 




 How's it going? I'm not very good at introductory messages,but thanks for replying. 




 Clothing should be a simple white blouse,buttoned to the neck and a long red skirt. She also wears boots made of insect chitin and a pendant in the form of a leafless tree  




 Sweet,cheers. :) 




 I don't have a picture but I can try to describe as best I can. Could you draw me a woman of about 35 years who has dark brown skin and her long,brown skin hair braided in an intricate pattern,almost like a the pattern of a doiley if you've ever seen one. She should have bright green eyes and a stern,angry look. Starting from her forehead,there should be a tattoo of a bird who's wings stretch down each cheek and its beak should stop just above her nose. The bird should be coloured blue and green . I hope that description is adequate,I can give more details if you want. Thanks,heaps . :) 




 Alesund-Sun Kil Moon.
Actually ,anything from Sun Kil Moon is good to listen to. 




 When I first bought vanilla WoW 5 years ago I read and re-read the manual for a month because my computer shat itself. 




 Hey, it's all practice, right? I like the way you did the gasmask, might keep it in mind next time I visualise this type of character. The context behind it is that he's deserted the army and find's a picture of a happy family on his way back, which he doesn't have, and it breaks him. 




 I acknowledge that animals have feelings and thank them for their sacrifice to bring me sweet,tasty meat products. You're doing God's work,countless millions of domesticated animals! 




 A man in a gas-mask and full scaled body armour kneeling while holding a photo of a happy family. Gas-mask should be integrated into his helmet and scaled armour should look reminiscent of a samurai's or a cop in riot gear. If this could be done in a realistic style I'd be very grateful. 




 No, not at the moment. I just recently went to my gp to get referred to a psychologist, though. I guess that's a start. I hope we do, too; it sucks having no real identity. 




 It is incredibly difficult to not be labeled as such. I make a point of never letting my friends know whether I'm feeling depressed or not because of the same fear that you have: that they will dismiss it as 'not their problem'. Unfortunately, when I drink I let my depression come to the surface and begin ranting about the meaninglessness of existence, which I feel alienates me slightly every time. I put it down to my belief that 'normal' people are afraid of depressed individuals; we are foreign to them in our behaviour and it unsettles them, even if they try to empathise they are still unnerved a little by us. They see in us an existence that they can't fully comprehend without having been there, and attempt to visualise what it would be like for them,which scares them, and so some try to distance themselves. Just as we (speaking from my perspective) can't understand what makes them happy, they can't understand what makes us depressed all the time, and so they label us as 'The Depressed Person'.By doing this it essentially isolates what we do and how we think and classifies it as the behaviour of the depressed, something they should try not to get involved in in case our negativity 'rubs off' onto them. This is just my observation ,however, I don't even know if all this made sense. 




 Don't have much of a story,I'm afraid. There aren't many interesting parts, it just kind of ponders along skipping all the usual milestones of life;there is no real good to it and there is no real bad. Frankly, I can't really see it achieving much. 




 This is incredibly close to how I feel. Even now,sitting in a lecture by myself, I can see a glimpse of.everyone else's potential personalities,but when I think of myself I can't remember what I used to be like. It's like I'm almost apart from everyone's reality,stuck in my own lonely existence. I wish I could escape and enter the 'living' world. Do you feel this way,too? 




 Awww yiss. Finally my highly visible 'wog' forearm veins will get me some. 




 So my pc has started restarting randomly while I'm using it. Sometimes it will restart as I'm starting it up, other times it will restart while I'm in the middle of a game. The weird thing is, though, it doesn't happen every time I start up a game. Sometimes I can play uninterrupted for hours, have a break, and then it will do it. It also does this thing where it will boot up, but the screen will go black even though I can hear the welcome noises on my headphones.

 Beautiful,thanks heaps! 




 A man in a gas-mask/respirator helmet and a full set of segmented armour kneeling while holding a picture of a happy family. Is that too complex? 




 Sweet, looking forward to it. 




 D: He's not a monstrosity;his name is Jooki and he's probably the friendliest river-burrower you could ever meet. Thank you so much for this, you have no idea how much this cheered me up.  




 If someone could draw me a picture of a small, coffee-skinned girl of about 15 or so with long, light brown hair holding an insect that is half the length of her. The insect would basically look like a massive centipede without the bottom antennae;it has no eyes, only four long,thin antennae on it head and a set of large serrated mandibles. It is also almost see-through. This would make my month if it could be drawn. Thanks,guys. 




 Do you know what they call lettuce in France? 




 I do this often,too. I also constantly think of theoretical situations regarding people I've never met potentially hurting me. 




 No problem,mate. Pm me whenever you need to vent. 




 I'm 19. I saw my first and only psychologist two years ago. Then I moved and have never really taken the steps again to see another one 




 I don't have a psychologist anymore. The one I did have did very little to change my perspective;probably because I didn't fully open up. I feel if  were to keep a journal I wouldn't show it to anyone anyway for fear of being misunderstood, or categorized as one personality type or another. 




 Emptiness is a fucked thing, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. The feeling that a sooner death could outweigh the endless possibilities that life presents is hard to shake sometimes. I've tried, but that notion stills persists. I can't give you any way of successfully filling that void,but I can empathize with you. I don't know much about life but if you just need someone to vent your troubles on,I'd like to help in whatever way I can. I hate seeing people share this shitty emptiness. 
























 It's all in the diaphragm,man. Gotta work that airway. 




 All good. I'm from Australia.

 I'm guessing that's...Wisconsin? Sorry, I'm not from the US. Sounds pretty cool,though. 




 Haha,wow. That is pretty cool. Where are they from? I'm not the kind of person who looks into an artist's history. 




 Hey! This is an awesome idea. I don't have Spotify but I should be able to manage a bunch of YouTube links. Could you make me a playlist centred around a sombre mood? Like the kind of music you'd hear if you were exploring a ruined city ,or were about to kill someone you love. I'm not a serial killer,btw. I'm a writer and this kind of music helps me visualise scenes. If it's any help,I usually listen to artists like The Fleet Foxes,Bon Iver and Massive Attack.

*Edit:Thanks heaps. 




 Cephaloporoid? 




 Gaming and working on my conlang. I only really rekindled my interest in the latter a couple of days ago, hopefully it'll lead to me wanting to write again.

 Please stop trolling.

The guy asked a serious question. 




 Don't worry,OP. I'm 5'7 and I'm still rowing. In fact, I think I'll always keep rowing as they'll beat me otherwise.^help 




 Welp,looks like I've found my problem. 

Thanks,mum 




 Holy Shit. You just slipped that right in there,didn't you ? 




 I want to be included,too! Does dressing as the Black Death for Year 8 Medieval Day count? 




 No amount of flying lawnmowers are going to settle these jimmies. Critical overrustle achieved. 




 Can I get a bravery check? 




 Language. 

I can barely sum up any interest or energy in most of the things I do, but learning about language and how it's formed by, and helps shape, sound patterns/morphological processes/syntax etc. is the only thing that really reminds me of the fact that I can still feel excited about something, even though my attention is sporadic at best. 




 Language! 




 Hey, guys.

I have almost non-existent social skills when it comes to meeting new people and one of the largest barriers I frequently come across is that I can never initiate conversation with anyone. I've been at uni for almost two semesters now and I have still yet to develop a proper social life;I have only really been able to talk to one other person out of all my classes at uni.

I barely see the friends I do have, and I can almost go whole weeks without speaking to anyone but my aunty. So I was wondering if any of you guys know how I can overcome my fear of talking to strangers?

Thanks heaps. 




 I found out that there is a group of non-pulmonic sounds in human language called ejectives which are pretty much sounds formed with little explosions of air afterwards; try saying 'p' but really forcing it out. I reckon that the fact that some language somewhere uses these as a  part of their everyday communication really awesome.^^^^ihavenolife 




 I dip my dick into a vat of soup to check if it's warm and 94 cats claw it off. 




 What was this man's name? Christ, everyone has a name.

Where had he lived? On a farm as I had? Did he too cherish memories of wide,clear sky reflected in small diaphanous ponds and welcome the calm blanketing of darkness on his fields after sunset had burnt itself into his retinas at the end of each day?

Had he also shared a million small moments with his lover, knowing things that only they had experienced? Had he held his lover's hand as she died of sickness as I had? Had he too broken the hope of his children when he'd explained where she'd gone? 

Is this why he was here?

Is this why he fought? For the same reasons as I do? Was he a broken man seeking solace in the face of this indifferent beast of war?

Did he dream of the feint chatter of wind-chimes before an angry,unforgiving horizon? Is that what kept him restful during the cold nights and their symphony of artillery barrages, when the only light to be found was in hellish flashes against a choked,pitiful landscape?

Had he also seen men wail before the arms of death as they clutched their organs as offerings? Did he fear silence as I do? Had he heard the breathless rattles of men seeking comfort from the impatient embrace of non-existence as they bled their life and memories onto the mud?

My chest tightened as I watched him splutter.

 If I was still the same man as I had been I would have left him to be found by his comrades. He would have lived.

But his eyes were too familiar, they begged with a pathetic fear akin to my own. What right  do I have to decide the fate of another wretched creature such as myself? What grand scheme directed these dire circumstances between us?

I felt my empathy curdle and lose its hold on my thoughts. 

Because he was not like me.

And so I shot him.  




 My book. 

I have a fucking language to invent, multiple cultures to write about and an entire bloody world history to create not to mention actually writing the novel, and here I am on Reddit writing about these things and not doing them. 




 Yeah,that's probably it. 

As I was getting towards the end of school I was getting more and more worried about missing out on the 'normal teenage-life milestones' that and so I probably figured "Hey, that girl was friendly to me earlier, I should have a crush on her. Maybe then I'll achieve what's expected to have been done by my age and become normal."

Pined over her for sometime but never really talked to her or did anything, and now I'm still holding myself to the fact that I missed my only chance to actually overcome my fear of women and be accepted into the wider 'class' of those who can establish intimate relationships with the opposite sex which in turn exacerbates my awkwardness and fear which in keeps me from allowing myself to even consider dating properly. 

I'm now pretty much proper fucked when it comes to women and socialising in general. It's funny how one simple decision can fuck you over in the longer run,eh? 




 To be honest, I don't really know. Kind of a fear of being put on the spot mixed with general beta faggotry. 




 Refusing an offer to be kissed by a girl in high school whom I later developed a crush for but didn't have the balls to ask out. 

Two years later and I still haven't kissed anyone. Fuck. 




 Just let the poor cunt know that he's not getting anywhere  and to stop messaging. It's clear that he's oblivious, so just do him a kindness and tell him to go elsewhere. Many guys that are perceived as creepy are that way because they haven't properly learnt how to identify when they're over-stepping these kinds of social barriers,and so continue to press. 




 Your grandfather seemed like a profound kinda guy. Thanks, I'll definitely be considering this metaphor the next time I feel shitty. 




 I also feel the same. The only time I'm ever talked to my friends about how I feel is when I've been very drunk, and I felt I alienated myself from them even more so by doing that.

I also have made a plan to kill myself, but I keep putting it off for arbitrary reasons. For instance, I was planning on doing it next week sometime a couple of days ago, but now I've ordered Rome 2 so I've decided I'll wait for that to come and the off myself.

I really do hope you find someone who's willing to talk to you. 




 I'm glad it made sense to someone. I agree with you on the stigma towards depressed people in our society, especially towards men. It's almost as if we're told as men that emotion is something you hold within yourself or express to, in limited circumstances, only your loved ones, and if you hold too much emotion, you're overreacting and being a woman. 

Combining this perspective with my sleight build and short height makes me feel almost feminine in the eyes of other men, and this weighs down heavily on me.

Thanks for your words and welcome to the sub!  




 Yeah, it's fucking shit. And you're making perfect sense, this is exactly what I think. I have no idea whether it is actual depression being tricky with me, or whether I'm 'forcing' my self to feel what I assume would be how a depressed person feels. 




 I think seeing a therapist will, in the long run, help both of us realise where to attribute these emotions to, whether it be legitimate depression or otherwise. I'm going to recommend you see a therapist, not because I think that that mine will necessarily help me, but because I believe everyone should be entitled to a chance to change their lives. Whilst my chance may have well abandoned me, I'd like to think that yours hasn't.

Keep on keeping on. 




 Thanks for the reply; the community here is awesome. 

I have a hard time conveying emotion to people, even my family. I always feel that it isn't my place to burden them with my emotional problems as they've already got their own. 

I find myself thinking like this with my counselor,too. I think about how many people's sob stories he has to sit through and how that must weigh down on his patience. 

For some reason I have this notion that men are not supposed to give into their emotions and seek help, and therefore I mustn't be a man and mustn't have a valid reason for this pain. Your response has offered me a different perspective to what I'm used to, thanks. I don't often open up to people (only when I'm considerably drunk) so the outpouring of good advice and care in this thread has confounded me. 




 Holy shit. This is almost akin to how my emotions are at the moment. I can go from feeling incredibly bitter one day to mildly depressed another to pretty much empty some other days. I am never fully incapacitated, but I'm always slightly off-centre enough that it impairs me socially. I also feel the same overarching desolation, it really sucks.

I really hope you beat it,man. At least one of us has to. 




 When I was younger my mum was really sick. In an effort to cheer her up,my little brother consolled her with these wise word as he was sitting by her bed:

"An old frog jumps into a pond. Splash."

To this day she still thinks that it was incredibly profound. 




 Don't really know where all the paperwork is due to the fact that I've moved house twice since then, so I have no idea whether it'd still be under warranty. I also don't know what the real problem behind the card is, all I know is that my PC highlighted that there was a problem with the graphics driver in the event centre, and also my event log shows multiple Kernel Power event-41 issues. 




 Sweet, thanks. Another question (sorry), should I upgrade my CPU as well? It's an i5-5700k, I think.
Edit:2500K, not 5700K 




 Cool,760's seem to be pretty cheap atm. Also, does a GPU having more memory necessarily make it better than one with less? Is that a stupid question to ask? 




 Hey, guys. So I've had my GTX 560Ti for about a year now, and I've been noticing some problems. 
My computer will crash randomly whilst playing some games, and when I check my event log, it tells me that these crashes are due to a Kernel-Power Event. 
On further investigation it appeared that my GPU was the cause behind these crashes,so I've decided that if they continue, I'll probably have to replace my GPU. Question is, which GPU should I buy if I choose to do so? (keeping in mind I'd prefer to upgrade in performance as well). Or should I spend money on getting my GPU fixed instead? 




 Indifference.

I believe that one of the greatest achievements in human evolution is our development of empathy. To know that so many people in the world do what they do without any consideration of the experiences of others and how their decisions may affect others, without even the tiniest shred of empathy, really unnerves me.

And to think that (at least Western) societies could become even more apathetic to the lives of even those who are closest to them, is especially worrying. I mean indifference isn't some modern construct endemic to modern society, but I believe it could become almost a virtue of our age. It's the universe's position to be indifferent to our plight, not humanity's. 




 What is the deepweb? I've heard some talk about it, but I don't know whether it's a joke or not. 




 Because it would imply that they were some sort of whiny bitch, and in the eyes of most men discussing personal strife is seen as weakness. I mean,shit, look at the some shitstorm female cutters get, could you imagine if a male revealed that he was slashing up? It's fucked, and part of the reason why I don't cut despite the fact I am in a fair amount of emotional strain.
*edit: I spek gud england 




 The world of my novel. I could go on for ages talking about the various nuances of Othenai culture, and the formation of various political organisations. No one ever really listens,though. ;-; 




 Yeah, I have skype. Pretty sure the name's the same as my Steam:Chezzprinn 




 I will, as long as I am comforted by the knowledge that you, the finest specimen come to be produced by humanity's long and arduous evolutionary journey, will carry forward our race into neo-liberal paradise! 




 2edgy4me. Please take your edginess elsewhere, you're too hardcore for this thread. 




 Ain't no stopping it now,mate. 




 I have a feeling the Chinese are the villains in Battlefield 4. Correct me if I'm wrong. 




 I have to say I still haven't gotten over it. Hell, I wasn't even bullied that much but it has had an enormous effect on my life. 

I can't do anything without hearing the voices of people who had mocked me. I alter my own actions and social responses by what I assume they would think appropriate for me to do. I think of myself as lesser, as a creep, as something that doesn't fit in. It has driven me to contemplating suicide almost daily and has drained meaning from my life. I've become a needy,nervous bitch of a man; exactly how they had presumed I'd turn out. 

I haven't talked about this before, sorry if it comes across a little dramatic. 




 For Emma,Forever Ago-Bon Iver. Especially the song "The Wolves", gets me every time. 
























 Wasn't particularly intending for it to be taken as woman-blaming, probably just worded it wrongly. Rejection from women was most likely not the cause, but I bet you it exacerbated the problem. 




 Probably should have put 'people' instead of 'women',sorry. Although, I would  make the assumption that the people most creeped out by these guys would generally be women.

But you're right, it isn't the women's fault for rejecting them. The sad thing is, it's most likely no one's fault. These guys are just unlucky products of something that must've happened in their past that royally fucked up their ability to form relationships with the opposite sex. The problem probably compounded overtime as they faced rejection because of it, which in turn made them more desperate for some connection, which in turn made them more creepy, which in turn made them become more and more alienated to the point where they rely on dolls to obtain any form of intimacy.

Now they're at the point were rejection is an expected outcome for probably any desire for a relationship because of this world they've created to hide from society's branding of them as a creep, a world ,which in turn, makes them even more unnerving to people.

It's pretty sad.

 









 Can confirm that I use this site as a crutch. Not so much on the 'making friends' part,though. I'm as poor at making friends in the virtual world as I am at making them in the physical world. 




 Not always as easy as it sounds. Would you want to talk to these kinds of guys? They've likely been abused/rejected by women for most of their life,so I can easily see how spending all this money on something that won't reject them could be feasible,rather than possible constant rejection by real people. There's only so many times you can be alienated before you go a little crazy. 




 Giving her the old Kalishinyourkova. 




 Looks awesome, bugs and all. Have they hinted at a release date yet? 




 It's all a ruse,I'll tell ya! OP has us duped! 




 That I can dislocate and relocate my hip.

When I was little, I used to continuously dislocate and relocate my hip when I was frustrated. Like *pop* in *pop* out *pop* in. Thought everyone could do it.

 Apparently not. 




 Is it already in the files? How'd you get it to appear in-game? 




 Good point. Common sense doesn't come naturally to me for some reason. Editing post. 




  If you don't want to read the whole thing, an analysis of a couple of chapters or so is fine.

Edit:[link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9NEUm1X4z32cW0wVkRuVVlHQk0/edit?usp=sharing)

Thanks guys. :) 




 I've got a PhD in Cunt. 




 I'll designate myself for that matter. I studied Cunt Identification Studies for four years. 




 I'm 5'7", therefore I shall be King of the Shortmen. 




 This kind of makes me sad.  




 Do you think a 280x, i5 2500k and 8GB RAM would be enough to play this at at least medium? 









 Looks fucking fantastic. 









 Fuck.

Every time I start to feel just a little better about myself, I see shit like this. Christ, what's the fucking point in attempting anything if you're unattractive? Even if you 'improved your life', gained hobbies, yadda yadda, people will still treat you as some kind of subhuman. 

I mean, fuck. Fucking insulted by compliments from ugly men? I hate existence. 




 Cool, thanks! It's around 16000 words,though. Do you want me to just send over a sample chapter, or the whole thing? 




 May as well jump on board as well. Do you read sci-fi fantasy? I could really do with some proper crit. My mum is not a very  unbiased reader. 









 Mate, this is how we all dance. Even the sheilas. Even the koalas. Everyone. 

Got me VB, got me stubbies. Time for a gabba. 




 Is this for real? Or is it a scam? Sorry, I'm a little too careful sometimes. 




 My friends and family all think I have something planned for the future, and that I care about my uni degree. Truth is, I can't even imagine living out more than a few more years without eventually committing suicide. 




 I doubt this.

I have overheard random strangers discussing my face with the exact same opinion as myself.  




 This is what I'm worried about. I keep thinking that I'm going to waste the minimal almost non-existent chance I have of finding someone and being happy because I'm so fucked up socially/emotionally, and that the rest of my life is going to be empty and much worse off. I'm pretty much awaiting the day when I finally become certain of killing myself as opposed to being undecided as I am now.  




 Depression.

It slowly but surely leached all meaning from them. I keep thinking 'Why bother doing anything when my life's shit anyway.I don't really want to keep living,so why then should I pretend to care about anything in my life?' 




 I don't really have passions anymore.

First my passion for writing died,then reading and now even gaming does nothing for me.

I'm like an empty shell.
 




 I would want to date her but I'm pretty sure I'd have like a 0.001% chance as I'm not the best looking dude and I weigh the same as most women my age.

I don't usually do anything social, so I probably wouldn't have anything better to do but I'd probably be miserable anyway. 




 I used to get stuck on the Zeppelin between Kalimdor and Lordaeron for hours at a time. 




 Hey,guys

So I just received an invitation from a girl in one of my uni classes to go to her birthday party. A bunch of people from this particular class have been invited, so I'm not under any special consideration or anything. However I don't really talk to anyone much in the class, so I was a bit surprised when I got the invite. There will also be a whole bunch of people there that I haven't met before so I'm worried that if I go, I will pretty much isolate myself as I don't really 'know' anyone.

What should I do? 




 I am the first person in existence to speak Othenai. 




 Eh, haircut or no haircut, I still look like a spaz. 




 Bugger.

I'm actually an ugly cunt, so seeing all of the people on here who aren't actually that ugly and still FA makes me feel kind of shitty. 
Hopefully you fools will use my pictures to motivate yourselves as it's definitely not your looks holding you back. Get out there!

Edit: Picture time is over.
 




 Did I tell you how much I smoke w33d? im liek a [-3] now 




 I'm a guy, I think it could be a little weird if I rubbed vaginal scent behind my ears. 




 My gooch is sparkly fresh every day and I've never been laid.

Edit: I think I may have been misunderstood. A gooch is slang for your perineum ( the skin between your arse and your knob) not for vagina. I'm a dude, I wash my gooch, not my vagina.  




 Depends how much effort you want to put into world building. 

If I were to name a new world, I would probably base its name off of the language of the main character/dominant culture/who is telling the story in the world. You don't necessarily have to create the entire language of the most dominant culture but if you align the world's name with the same distinct style as, say, the cities of this culture, it would give it a unique flavour.  




 My dad went through this exact same procedure! They also took bone from his wrist to use as cartilage for the new nose. His doesn't look so fancy,though. 




 Very little nowadays. Even when I laugh I feel pretty empty.  




 It makes you feel that  the only solace and acknowledgment you will ever receive is from the wheels of an oncoming train. 




 Ah,ok.

Haven't really heard much about neuroplasticity  outside of the small amount of time I spent reading about it for my linguistics classes, so I'm definitely uninformed on the matter. 




 humans aren't locked in like you seem to think.

Maybe not so much for Alphas and Betas, but most of the stuff I've read pretty much condemns Omegas to a lifetime of mediocrity and inadequacy.  




 I have no idea what you are talking about as far as Omega's and your pyramid but I will say a few things

Pyramid structure probably wasn't the right term to use, I'll change that. Cheers.

As for the 'fake it till you make it', I have trouble wondering how someone would go about doing that, basing their entire life off a false persona. It is really that easy? 




 Right here with you,mate. I'll sit in the same spot for the majority of the weekend imagining the happy, eventful lives of others. 




 All the time,man.

I know that to get better and actually live a good life', I am going to have to drastically change the way I look/behave/think. Knowing this makes me bitter, and so I tell myself that even after all my struggles to get better, if I choose to get better, I'll be a totally different person and I'll hate myself for it. I'll hate myself and, more so,I'll direct that hatred onto others. 

I still believe that happiness isn't something that I'm allowed to achieve in the end; I'm just not meant to ever get it, and that if I do,it will be unnatural.  




 Great, now I have to cancel my tickets.

Fuck.
