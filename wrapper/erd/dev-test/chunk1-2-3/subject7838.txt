 The flashback to the Trojan war sort of shows his beginnings 




 Bottom part is the Aeneid and the Odyssey, great classics 




 Wowsers.  Here's my own story chart in progress http://i.imgur.com/pOG1NNi.jpg 




 "I'm Always so on top of my game"

Haha 




 Notice how Matthew's character is afraid of time and the spaceship on the poster is like a watch/clock as it is a circle split up into 12 sections 




 Just realized that the ship has 12 different sections, not unlike the face of a watch 




 Thanks.  I'll give it a try soon 




 I'm playing through night 6 of FNAF 1 now and it's a lot of fun.  I like watching videos of people playing FNAF 2 but it doesn't look as cool and looks unnecessarily complicated.  Does anyone else feel the same way?  Or should I change my mind and give it a try? 














 I saw it at TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood.  They started the film and it was playing upside down.  Took them 15 minutes to fix it 





























 For example, some horror movies have been ranked by which produced the highest heart rate (The Shining increases bpm by 28%) and some comedies are measured in "laughs per minute" (Airplane has 3 laughs per minute). 




 That movie is #8 top grossing all time (adjusted for inflation) and yet it's not on very many "top 100" lists at all. 




 Hooray 




 Surely you can't be serious 




 6th grade for me 




 The Lady Vanishes!  It's Hitchcock but no one ever seems to mention it.  I enjoyed it more than The 39 Steps. 




 What happened to Dr. Zhivago...?  Deleted comment, oops.  I liked that one more than Lawrence of Arabia 




 What we have here is a failure to communicate. 




 How are you so good at gardening?  It sure beets me 














 The Lady Vanishes 1938.  Proves that you don't need Hans Zimmer to get your mind blown. 









 I meant 2011 to 2014, sorry.  The Lego Movie is top-ranked so far this year.

Warner Brothers acquired Rotten Tomatoes in 2011, so those are the years in question.

 Yeah I know where you mean.  They have video cameras there?  I've never heard of any parks literally stopping a ride because of video cameras. 




 That's the bottom of the first drop... There ain't no brakes there 


































 The scariest monsters are the ones you don't see...

Some students and I made "The Haunting":

 Brilliant 




 Time to face the facts 




 Frazbear's Freight... look out for the Freddy train! 




 You've got me beat, dangit 




 School film contest 




 Noope 




 Nope 




 There's a link to merchandise on the right side of your page under "The Community" 




 It's Mr. Potato Head, Iron Man version, a.k.a Tony Starch 




 Play it on mobile and don't use headphones, it's less scary 




 That's a good point.  Do we know if anyone is possessing the suit? 




 Freddy Fazbear's Pizza does birthdays!  Reserve the party room! 




 I think "Freddy's: The Ride" would be awesome 









 wut 




 Yeah, Jaws also comes to mind as a good example.  Or some scenes in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. 




 I would be super tempted to eat it

And then you would have to send me another 




 It is about murderous animatronics but one of the reasons why it's so successful is no blood or violence is explicitly presented.   

In this article he talks about trying to keep it "relatively clean with no blood or guts" http://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/developer-spotlight-scott-cawthon/

This reserved approach to horror is rarely seen but super effective, I mean the only comparison I could think of is Alfred Hitchcock (who was Catholic) who made thrillers like Psycho and the Birds 




 What happened to just calling him Golden Bonny? 




 School in LA 




 I never noticed Bonny in/on the arcade machine before 









 Nobody is from California? 




 Here's my story chart http://i.imgur.com/pOG1NNi.jpg 














 What if the character can't go through the vents unless you forget to keep the ventilation systems online? 




 Well here it is in another song 20 years older https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEibygqqLZc 




 Best thing I've seen all day 




 The chord is a sample from "I Love You More" by George Duke 




 I'm a big fan (no, not like the one on the desk) and I've beat night 6 in both games.  However, none of my friends want to play it; they are either too scared or don't understand the concept.  How do you share this game with people?  What are your experiences with this? 




 Just beat it yesterday!  You can do it, the custom nights are worth it.  Wind up the box 4 twists at a time and shine the light for Foxy, those are the tips that helped me finish it 




 Why not just draw one card and use the color on that one to dictate 1-10 vs 11-20?  So you'd only need 4 cards 




 The cameras are definitely going to be in the game. 




 Yeah I did but the way you said that makes me think I didn't 




 Yeah but I don't use it very often 














 Love that new pain job 




 I'd like to think this is what the peeps are thinking in Roller Coaster Tycoon or Sim City 




 Gosh darn it 




 Three entrances, sorry. 




 Just noticed that in FNAF 1, there are 2 doors in your office.  In FNAF 2, there are 3 doors.  In FNAF 3, there is only one apparent door.  Chronologically, Scott is counting down 3, 2, 1... 
























 Made it myself, took me forever to figure out how to make a gif out of it 
























 1987! 




 I didn't know that's how ^how ^^you ^^^did ^^^^it 




 Everyone has been talking about WHO the killer is, but regardless of the killer's identity perhaps it is more important to ask WHY he killed the kids.

One possibility is revenge against the company.  Another possibility is that he is a psycho.  However, I think it is likely that the killer was attempting something beyond violence and horror.  

We've all seen real animatronics.  They are slow, clumsy, and artificial.  They are mechanical and impersonal.

What if you could create a human machine?  A robot with character?  What if you could give dead servos and metal beams a life?

Perhaps this is what the real killer was after.  They wanted to bring hope to a dismal restaurant.  They wanted to give the robots personality.  They wanted it to be a place where "fantasy and fun come to life".  

And what better to give a robot life than the soul of a child?  Curiosity, joy, energy...  It seems perfect.  And each kid would give his character some type of personality, and they would live forever.

"It is lamentable that mass agricultural development is not speeded by fuller use of your marvelous mechanisms. Would it not be easily possible to employ some of them in quick laboratory experiments... Countless uses will be made by future generations." 




 I live 15 min from Disneyland haha.  Gotta love Disney but there's still something creepy about all those smiling animatronics... 




 What if someone who doesn't know the game finds these actually scary? 




 How come Cedar Fair is into building double B M hypers at some of their parks? 




 I made a watercolor painting of that in high school, pretty much the exact same angle.  The double corkscrews over the ponds are pretty amazing. 




 Excellent 




 He means it is scary, not bad. 




 Good stuff! 




 I don't care if you're waiting for the 3rd game to come out today.  Maybe you're trying to keep everything under control on the subreddit.  Whatever.

One of my favorite albums is Daft Punk's 2005 "Human After All".  Listen to it to make your Friday better. http://youtu.be/wh6Vh0xL0uI


How does this tie in to the game?

1. Human After All - Even if you don't think that the robots in the game are haunted, they have many human qualities gamers have attributed to them.  Curiosity, anger, loneliness, suspicion, playfulness... Do they actually have personalities or is it nothing more than basic programming personified by our imaginations?

2. Prime Time of Your Life - Several children have been cut down in the prime time of their lives at Freddy's Pizzeria.  Listen to how this song starts out slow and fun, but then accelerates into a ridiculous frenzy.  It is over before you fully appreciated it.

3. Robot Rock - Fun to hear the robot voice evolve over the course of this song from a guitar to a voice distinctly saying "Robot Rock".  You can imagine all the robots jamming out to this one on the show stage.

4. Steam Machine - There's no way that the company is good after everything that they've tried to hide.  Fazbear Entertainment is a ridiculous excuse for a corporation, and yet they keep plodding forwards, mechanically wiping everything out of their way.  At the end of the song, it sounds like the whispering voice says "Fear Machine" instead of "Steam Machine".

5. Make Love - Probably represents that weird part of the fandom.  Toy Chica... yeah, never mind.  But on a better note, maybe this relaxed song is about the parents trying to move on without their children and let it go.

6. The Brainwasher - Killer track.  Imagine those hallucinations getting more and more intense as the robots get closer... are they messing with your mind?

7. On/Off  - Sounds like switching a television on and off.  Minor glitch in the system.

8. Television Rules The Nation - Closed circuit television rules the pizzeria!  You are in charge, and somehow the robot's behavior is affected by which cameras you look at and when.  However, this could be the robot anthem against the security guard... you might think television rules the nation, but we'll see who's in charge at the end of the night.

9. Technologic - Shut it.  Wind it.  Switch it.  Find it.  Check it.  Close it.  Quick, replay it.

10. Emotion - Pretty much sums up the whole game.  Do the robots have feelings?  What do they think when the clock strikes 6-o-clock and they realize their robotic programming has made them kill someone?  What do they feel when they get back in their places as the sun rises?  Do the families come back to look at the restaurant and remember?


Anyway, thanks for reading.  Rock on and relax and remember how great the other 2 games have been. 




 How can you tell? 




 What is it? 




 I wasn't sure where one act started and the other ends... So they just kind of fade into each other 




 Yeah I think so 




 True.  Fortunately a lot of people are posting links to more story structures so next time I can cover more 




 Sure thing 




 Haha the Double Shyamalan... classic 




 I know it's click bait but gosh dangit I put some work into it.

Unlike Buzzfeed or Upworthy or whatever. 




 For sure!  Next time 




 Including Campbell for sure next time!

Aristotle's Poetics is boss.  Not sure what part to put on the chart though. 




 Haven't seen the movie.  Take the run time and spread it along the length of the chart, then find events in the movie and see if they coincide with some of the story descriptions 




 You mean thesis, antithesis, synthesis?  That's a good one, I should add that 




 Wow, why have I never heard this before?  Awesomeness 




 True that.  A lot of my friends also finish something for the first time and then spend forever trying to sell it, instead of realizing that they can go back and write something new and better now that they have the practice. 




 I've seen some of Kurt Vonnegut's simple structures and I really like them (Boy Meets Girl, Man in Hole, Cinderella).  Not sure if I should draw all of them in or what though.

Definitely going to include Campbell next time around, some other comments pointed out that Campbell and Vogler aren't the same like I thought they were.

Russian stuff is great too.  Never would have found that by myself, thanks.  And holy cow, that search engine is ridiculous.  

One of the reasons why I made this chart is because it shows you that one "structure" obviously doesn't have it all.  Learning from all of these and then borrowing what you can is great.  Personally, I think it's kind of hard writing from a formula, which is why I use this chart mostly for analyzing other stories and not when I'm writing my own.

I love what you said about vignettes/sequences.  If you think about it, you could shrink this whole chart down and then repeat it several times within a movie.  So we might have several separate quests within the overall journey and it will still be interesting to the audience 




 I really hate using computer software if I could be physically drawing it myself, but maybe I'll give it a shot. Any idea what software I should use?  Photoshop? 




 That's true, it is definitely not exhaustive.  These are just some popular ones in America.

What are some examples of foriegn storytelling that I should include next time?   




 That sounds awesome, thanks.  I'll be sure to include him in the next version of the chart.

 I like how he puts focus on ending your story well, because it's very easy to have a great opening and then not know where you're going. 




 Thanks for reading 




 Thanks for reading! 




 Sure thing 




 You're welcome! 









 Are teh same person 




 What game do you play solely for the purpose of how hilariously unpredictable the program is?

My favorite is Backyard Skateboarding from 2004.  Flying through walls, falling into the sky and having your character turn into a mangled ball are all common occurrences. 




 In one single shot, straight from the beginning? 




 Pride and Prejudice for days 




 I've only been here a week so it's kinda hard to keep up.

I've brought this theory up a few times and people say it's "likely", but to me it seems pretty obvious to me that the shadow ghost from FNAF 2 is a hint to the next game. 









 Makes me wonder though. http://i.imgur.com/nB83X7J.jpg 




 I know there's only a few interviews with Scott Cawthon out there, but what are your favorite quotes from him?

Here's mine from the IGM interview, Scott is responding to why the animatronics in the game rarely move:  "Thats one of the things that makes these 'creatures' so scary in real life. If youve ever been to an animatronic show at a theme park or a restaurant, they can be creepy when they move, sure. But its when they are turned off that the veil is lifted, and you realize that they were never alive. They are, and always have been, dead." 




 I think the hilarity of what you're talking about is that the game is an innocent concept gone wrong, and for some reason, everyone in the fandom has tried to put it back to normal. 

 So now we're at a place when everything seems so stupid because Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and Freddy are so familiar to us in their happy cute cartoon forms.

Until you open up the game and play it again, which is when you realize that metal sculptures left in a pizzeria at night are moving towards you for mysterious reasons.

Scott said it best in the IGM interview: "Animatronics can be creepy when they move, sure. But its when they are turned off that the veil is lifted, and you realize that they were never alive. They are, and always have been, dead." 




 Do you think it is likely that Shadow Bonnie is Salvage?  What else is it supposed to be? 




 Salvage obviously looks old and withered.  The 3rd game takes place 30 years later, so do you think that he could get that old and withered in 30 years time?

He obviously wasn't created after the pizzeria in FNAF1 shut down, and he wasn't pieced together from the remains of others since the Steam description says the animatronic was discovered, not built.  So he's been around.

What if he was in the first game.  What if he was the one creeping around, writing messages on the walls and on the backs of the signs...

WHAT IF SALVAGE HAS BEEN THERE THE WHOLE TIME

P.S. has it been confirmed if Shadow Bonnie from FNAF 2 is actually Salvage?  The teeth look similar.  If so, that would confirm his presence in both games. 




 Made it to 5 AM before power shut out, does that mean I'm getting closer? 




 Had this happen to me on mobile.  Had to put down the phone and look away 




 Bought it, there's a link on the side of this page, it's under "The Community"
