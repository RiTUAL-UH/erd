 Actually a friend of mine put some in his car and boy is it dirty (his is black though and I live in a dusty little town)

I'm not sayin the vinyl looks bad but the design is... Well... I wouldn't drive that personally 




 I would imagine the upkeep must be a pain, imagine washing this and then a part of it comes off and you're like

 Why does coal need testing? 

 




 I don't know if that looks awesome or if they just screwed up that car...
