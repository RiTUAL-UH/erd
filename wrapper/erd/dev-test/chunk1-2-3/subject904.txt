 Im not a fan of the "waves of zombies from generator being on" but i can see it attracting ones that are already nearby due to noise.
Edit: i would also like to add I love the idea of the higher number of people required for progression. A person will always be able to find a group. 




 Lolwut  




 Okay i see your point. The only problem for me is if i miss that first shot, im toast. 




 Often in a group ill choose the sks, because normally someone else has long range, but what would you pick if you were alone? 




 My goal of this  post is to always have a definitive choice when it comes to these guns. So could you please tell me why the mosin over the sks. 




 A lot of times thats what i think, but the fact that the mosin is always a one hit kill makes me torn between the two. 




 Its most likely that same part, but for the Remington 870
 




 Epoch. Best version of dayz out there. 




 I get that, and there are quite the number
Of troll fresh spawns. I wish there was a way to make this work regardless. 




 Alright, i see where you're coming from. Im just very tired of spawning in, walking for a minute and a half just to get offed by a guy with a mosin on some roof 




 Just no? No constructive criticism?  
























  This time, the doors are standing wide open.


Edit: doors not soors
 




 Well my hope was that since its in the second person, you make that choice. What would YOU do in that situation. 




 Damnit Abigail. Get your shit together!
 




 makes sense. western jets are indeed, the coolest shit to ever have. ever. 




 I hate to tell you, but i've read a nosleep with the EXACT same plot, but I believe there was only one clone of the original... 




 Yeah, OP, i get you want this and i think its nice, but the truth is, they cant (and wont, i dont blame them) change a whole system that is already made, just to make crafting a bit more challenging.

Also, in some ways i dont like your idea. If you think to dayz epoch, it is very hard to build there. That has its problems, as it creates an extreme gap between the group of 10 guys with a cinder fortress and the noobs in the tent that get gunned down every five minutes.
 




 Even in dayz, kos city, i make it my goal to not have to put anyone down. Dont get me wrong, i die a lot, but i plan to be the friendliest guy you will meet. 




 Yeah the garand is the one im praying for.

 I would personally rather see more practical weapons. The xm2010 is rare as hell as is, and same for the m82. Desert eagles i guess, but they shouldn't be abundant. As for the tar and famas. The famas is an exotic weapon and should be rare. And the tar would probably be the civilian version (iwi tavor) and not have to be ultra rare 




 Alright so nearly every gun on earth... Don't forget, this is America. 


"America, where you can buy a gun for cheaper than a month's rent" 
























 No matter what country you come from, we can mostly all agree. EARTH, FUCK YEA! 




 people are applauding THIS pope, because he is the first one courageous enough to change those thoughts, which isn't that easy of a thing to do. 




 Bushmaster XM15, i got a magpul handguard, pistol grip, rear sight, and buttstock for it. Paid around 900$ for everything after mags and background check and all. 









 Oh shit they are the zombies!!! Its just worded very very well! 




 everyone! 




 didn't see that coming! 




 Are they cannibals? Or looking to steal food? Either way i like it! 




 I really like this story, probably one of the best 'zombie' stories ive read in a while 




 Thanks! 




 10/10 would crossbow again
