 equals one of my balls being the size of a clementine  




 Thanks for the figurative slap in the face you are right but emotions are powerful things 




 Think I'm gonna retaliate with doxycyclin and learning from this experience sorry to disappoint you 




 This seems to be the general consensus of the thread and I would like to thank all of you for not letting my emotions get the better of me 




 Drunk plus how good sex feels without a condom equals I'm a dumbass 




 I let my emotions get the better of me cause I'm fucking pissed off. Everyone in this thread is right doing anything to him is childish and not going to change anything in the long run 




 Then I find out I'm a horrible judge of character and lose faith in humanity 




 A little fucking callous but you make good points. 




 You could be completely right but I'm usually a very untrusting person because I have had the shit manipulated out of me before. She has proven herself to me thus far but of course she could just be a manipulative bitch and be incredibly good about it. If i find out that's true goddamn I don't know if I could trust anyone ever again. 




 Like I said i trust her a lot and I'm usually a very cynical person. You could definitely be right but I think I'm a good judging people and she has proven herself to me though. But everyone in this thread saying to be the better man are correct. I'm letting my emotions get the better of me. 




 She figured out he was cheating on her about a week after she had gotten an STD test and was clean. She dumped him immediately afterwards and we met about month later. I now have chlamydia and epididymitis because of an admittedly lapse in judgement on my part(bareback).

Her last boyfriend was obviously a huge piece of shit. I trust her story 100% because she got an IUD and had to get tested before that. I had also gotten tested recently and the only girl I have fucked since then is her. I am 99.9999% sure that I am the only guy she has fucked since the breakup, we have a very open and trusting relationship.

I just found out about the STD so obviously emotions are running pretty high. He not only cheated on this girl that I care for a lot but also gave us both chlamydia. What would you do in this situation reddit?

**EDIT**: One of the first times reddit has actually been productive for me instead of counterproductive. Y'all are right I am letting my emotions getting the better of me and this is mostly my fault

 I suggest watch the documentary When you're strange. It's narrated by Johnny Depp and tell the story of the Doors in a very entertaining way. Although I guess you'd have to fuck up hard to make something about Jim Morrison's life not entertaining.

If you like that read the biography No One Here Gets Out Alive

 Let's face it, this school is fucking hard... especially when professors refuse to give out practice tests or only give out one(*cough* physics department *cough*). I think it would benefit everyone if we put together a r/gatech word server where anyone could upload materials from classes they previously took(like a fraternity or sorority word). I could probably set something up if there's any interest... 




 Oh all the time. One time a few friends and I were tripping on acid and we decided to throw milkdrop up on one of the projectors. Got a few weird looks from the kids trying to study(fucking nerds) but it was a great experience 




 I don't think reddit would benefit from people ignoring this so much as not misinterpreting it. It's not saying plagiarize and copy, it's saying take things that speak to you from various sources and make them your own.

 For some reason, my hands and feet sweat excessively at all times. Even as I'm typing this now, I can feel the grimy, clammy sweat building up on my hands and it's really uncomfortable. This always makes handshakes pretty awkward, I definitely would be pretty grossed out if I shook someone's hand only to find it wet with sweat. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Of course I know the ol' wipe your hands on your pants trick, but that just doesn't quite cut it for me any more...

I can do a decent posh accent(or so I've been told by actual british people) and I've thought about just one day starting to talk in a british accent and never stopping. Sure I'd loose all my friends probably but eventually I could make new friends who wouldn't know I'm actually american. I'd get so many more chicks that way it'd be awesome 




 Hmmm, how about saying it was an interesting movie made me think about things I never would have thought about before? Does that make me sound stupid?
 









 Jim Morrison for sure 




 Yeah, he has a ton of really mind blowing videos. My favorite is where he somehow subconsciously convinces like 30 mall goers to raise their hands in the air at the same time with just a few announcements over the loudspeaker.

Honestly, I can't help but be skeptical that he didn't stage some of his videos but everything I've watched paints him as a honest down to earth guy who wouldn't stage things just to increase his ratings.

Here's the video if anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOEKdaXIEHc

 Get outside man. Go hiking or something. Go look at nature and try to comprehend the trillions of complex organic reactions that are occurring right before your eyes.

 Wow I never knew how much of an asshole Edison was. Electrocuting an elephant in front of a crowd of people proves nothing and I'm sure he knew that, its just the general public didn't have much of an understanding of electricity at the time.

 I don't get this viewpoint at all. Technology has progressed enough so that things like instant replay can be used in soccer. Sure coming up with rules so that this could be implemented without drastically changing the game play will take a bit of thought but I believe it is possible. 

In this world cup, in almost every single game I've watched, the refs have made at least one bad call that would have been overturned by an instant replay. Why would you resist trying to make the game more fair? That goal England scored yesterday would have drastically changed the game. The disputed goal this article talks about would have drastically changed the game. 

Change is a good thing if it's done right.

 I took a 4000 level intro to neuroscience class last semester and it blew my mind. What defines 'you', your personality, inhibitions, vocabulary and memory is in fact tangible and malleable.

 Yeah mental illness scares the fuck out of me, I read a story here from a paramedic send to a girls house by her mother because she was having an episode again.

He walked into the house and found the girl sitting by herself in the living room. Apparently as he walked in she stared at him for about 30 seconds and that stood up completely inhuman way that he said looked like something a human could never do. She then said something along the lines of I am the devil incarnate. She then held her hand up in way it seemed like she was holding something and said to him I Hold here the key to enter the gates of hell and walked up to him.
He has absolutely no belief in the supernatural and he still said it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to him and it still freaks him the fuck out to this day. 




 So say the main character of this game is a paranoid schizophrenic. For example maybe he is the only person in this world to have telekinesis or something along these lines and despite his mental illness he has to overcome it to save the world. You would have to deal with that, all along dealing with things like hearing voices, hallucinations and other paranoid schizophrenic presents. You wouldn't be able to tell what was real and what wasn't although maybe there would be a subtle ability to recognize a pattern to get to the bottom of this. The game would be a total mind fuck but it would be really interesting to deal with problems and eye opening for people who don't know much about this disease 




 I think you should reread my post man. Dont think you fully understood it

 So recently I've been on a huge comedy kick and I'm looking for more shows to keep this bender going. I love seinfeld and curb, WLIIA, scrubs, seasons 2-12 of the Simpsons, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Metalocalypse, squidbillies, superjail, venture bros, and a ton more there's no need to list. As you can see my tastes are really diverse and I'm open to anything, recommend me a hilarious new show and you won't regret it. 

I also love british humor  




 Would that entertain you for eternity though or would you eventually get tired of it? I remember in the movie trainspotting they described the the feeling of shooting up heroin as far better than any orgasm you will ever have. This would be the exact same thing everyday and it just makes me wonder would you eventually get bored of pure bliss? 




 I always thought if I was groundhog dayed I would try a bunch of crazy drugs I would never try otherwise. I specifically thought of H, I've dabbled in opiates, even took OCs a couple times but never tried heroin. But in your predicament, you might as well make the best of it.


There are no downsides, you can't OD, you can't build up a tolerance, no money worries, etc. So I was wondering from people who have tried this, would doing heroin all day everyday make you feel good enough that you wouldn't mind being stuck in one day over and over again for an unimaginable amount of time? I think the writers of groundhog day said Bill Murray spent about 9000 years in his day. 


Of course psychedelics would be really fucking interesting too and many other drugs would be a lot of fun but I have a feeling that it'd be kinda hard to find those in Puxatony.

 I'll do my best to explain a 4D cube(hypercube). First we'll relate the 2nd and 3rd dimensions because it is much easier to comprehend. We begin with a 2D square, this is simple enough it exists in only the x and y planes. To get a 3D cube from a square, we draw another square with the same x and y coordinates but change the z coordinate. Now you have two squares, one above the other, and you can simply connect all the vertices to form a cube.

A cube exists in the x, y and z planes which intersect at 90 degree angles with each other. To get to the fourth dimension we need to add another plane which still intersects with the x, y and z plane at a 90 degree angle. I personally can't imagine what this looks like, I'm not sure if it's even possible for us to comprehend it, but mathematically it is possible. Lets call this fourth dimension w for simplicity's sake. A hypercube is simply two cubes with the same x, y and z coordinates, separated in the w direction, and connected at the vertices. Mathematically simple to describe, but a bitch to imagine.  




 I think common sense predicts that 




 It would probably be well before that actually... 




 DUH 




 Yeah I've thought about what a 4D object would be like quite a bit. The 4th dimension would be a direction that is perpendicular to the up and down, left and right, and away and towards directions(x, y, and z). A 4D creature observing us would be able to see all sides of us along with everything inside of us all at once. 

If, say a 4D sphere were to pass through our world, to us it would look like a small sphere that appears out of nowhere and could even hang in midair, gradually gets bigger until it reaches a maximum size and then shrinks and disappears. The easiest way I've found to even kind of understand is to imagine us observing/interacting with a 2D world and kind extrapolate what it would be like to the interactions between a 4D world and a 3D world. 

Carl Sagan has a great video I'm sure you can find on youtube where he explains the 4th dimensions with the poetic yet scientific style he was famous for.  




 I always thought those were called hyper-cubes... but yeah thats four spacial dimensions. I have no idea what the fuck three time demensions would be like.

One spacial dimension is easy enough to imagine however but it's hard to even think of time as a dimension, how the hell can you have 3D time? Such a mind fuck  




 Here's what NASA has to say about it. Still not much explaination though

http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/science_faq.html#36 




 One of the reasons I posted this is I was hoping someone could explain it. Although I doubt it's possible for our brains to comprehend three time dimensions, it's hard enough trying to imagine a fourth spacial dimension. 




 Yeah I know right, I definitely can comprehend this it's so simple and intuitive!

 One good topic is how good at parallel parking I am. Always a great conversation starter 




 I'm about to be 23 years old and I've been depressed since about 14 or 15. At first I really had no reason to be depressed, I had a good group of friends, was part of the "popular" crowd, like that matters. I think what really kicked it off for me was getting pretty bad acne for most of high school. It hurt my self esteem and I don't think I've ever really recovered.

I am seeing a psychiatrist and am on lexapro and klonopin for anxiety. The depression is really just killing my work ethic which mean I'm struggling in school and lately I feel I've been even withdrawing from my friends here in college. I dread being awake and sleep way too much. Here is a little something I wrote while I was feeling really bad that I think outlines how I feel every day.



Suddenly, unexpectedly consciousness returned with a forceful jolt. Whatever he was dreaming, it was long gone to him now, it shattered like a glass dropping from a great height. He could feel a cold sweat encasing his body and threw off the blankets. It all quickly came back to him and, just like every morning, he wished it hadnt. The inanity, the despondence, the overwhelming feeling of dread accompanying each day, he could not imagine life without it. His only solace was that he could feel himself becoming more and more numb to it each morning. Maybe someday he would wake up and it wouldnt bother him anymore, maybe someday this would become normal for him, but today was not that day.

I was just wondering if you could give me any advice on how to get out of this tailspin. The only time I'm happy is when I am seeing a girl and I have been broken up with twice probably due to my depression. I just want to feel motivated and normal again.

No idea why I like it and it disgusts me in real life or if its real but I guess it's the whole domination/power thing. When im having sex with I'll get into dirty talk a bit like "you've been such a naughty girl" etc... Wow that sounds fucking lame typed out but I think the whole exchange is fairly normal. I may be just jaded by porn so someone please let me know if this is odd or I am fucked up freak.

 I agree the fact that he grouped both acid and ecstasy with meth just makes absolutely no sense... I probably thought similarly when I was like 16 but that was 7 years and a few trips ago.

Don't get me wrong they're not healthy for you by any means, ecstasy more so than acid, but they're definitely not meth. 




 Sounds like you really don't know much about drugs at all. Anyone who has any sense would tell you coke is a much worse drug than acid... care to explain your reasoning? 




 I agree about time for me to take off if you know what I mean ;)

 Get better friends 




 Congratulations! I can't really relate, I've been blessed with a really fast metabolism but I'm sure that will slow down as I get older(only 22 now). 

Right now, I can basically eat anything I want, be completely sedentary and not gain any weight whatsoever. Add the fact that unless I'm eating one of the few foods I absolutely love, I see eating more as an inconvenience than anything and you get my 6' 135 lbs self. 

Opposite ends of the spectrum I guess, I can definitely feel the physical effects of being slightly underweight but I still consider myself very lucky.

PS you speak English better than half of the native speakers here.
 









 Well yeah, I wouldn't say it to someone I just met or am just acquaintances with but with my girlfriend or other girls I'm decent friends with I am sure I'm not offending anyone. Maybe it's just my personality but it's very obvious I'm joking as I'm usually a very nice and pleasant person.

Also it's not like I do this all the time or even very often at all. 




 Have you ever posted anything that wasn't a personal attack or racial/sexual slur? Why the fuck would you keep posting with -785 karma? People here seem to despise you.... for good reason too. You have no room to comment on the content of anyone else's posts. 

Keep up the good work 




 Cunt is much much worse than ho. You can get away with saying ho jokingly to a friend but not so much with cunt 




 Mmmm my roommate once acquired an entire box of Zax's sauce from his girlfriend whose mom worked at Zaxbys. We put that shit on everything, damn that was a good couple months

 WHAT THE DICK 




 Are you are jumping to conclusions like that dude from office space. I take responsibility for my actions as you can see in this thread but fuck you 




 Yep this was a huge wake up call for me why are fucking biological urges to reproduce so strong it's not fair 
























 I'm wondering if this type of movement would be applicable to improve all-terrain vehicles, maybe something kind of like that robotic pack mule. Probably not because of the whole volume to surface area ratio thing. Even if it was, I'm sure this would have been at least considered in the engineering process of the robot mule. 




 Well he also started drinking so heavily after Watergate that his staff actually had to take the nuclear codes away from him. [Source](http://books.google.com/books?id=kasyAwAAQBAJ pg=PA79 lpg=PA79 dq=nixon+drunk+nuclear+codes source=bl ots=aHPhopAtjV sig=KcdZTb9gJSOUcBILMKq7GxPr1ds hl=en sa=X ei=3GJLU43wEMnO2wWCtoCYCA ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage q=nixon%20drunk%20nuclear%20codes f=false)

He was a pretty shitty guy in all reality and might have started a nuclear war if he had been able to. 




 SUBTLE LIKE MY DICK IN YO MOMMA 




 If I could actually write, I would have had the character turn to run and see another one in that direction. Turn a different direction, same thing.  




 Hahah I'm sorry but I had to edit that. I kind of feel bad because it was almost too perfect of a typo but that's just too embarrassing. 




 I know, right? Imagine walking through somewhere like the woods or a poorly lit park at night and seeing something weird out of the corner of your eye. You look and its one of those things just standing in the distance. After a moment or two it starts slowly walking toward you. As it gets closer you begin to notice there are others surrounding you doing the same thing and there's no where to run, no way to get away.

I wish I could actually write well because I feel like this would be scary as shit, but I'm just a lowly engineer.

Edit: I wish I could put into words the scenario I'm imagining, creative writing is fucking harder than I thought. If someone wants to actually make this into a well written scary story go for it.
 




 I don't remember learning about anyone other than Einstein and Bohr throughout any of my schooling up until college/ 




 Ah, welp looking back on what I wrote he's right. I had to pull an allnighter last night getting ready for a couple exams I've got on Monday so I'm not exactly the most coherent person right now and those study aids make me ramble like a mad man too. 




 This is going to sound really condescending but I don't understand why stuff like this is a big deal and gets so many up votes just because someone is wearing something related to reddit. If I saw something like this I would probably think "oh cool he must really like Reddit" and go on my way.

 Reddit is one of the biggest if not the biggest social media aggregate sites on the internet.
 It's not like it's some like super secret esoteric club, I'm 24 and almost every single one of my friends goes on Reddit at least occasionally. I just feel like sometimes people have this idea that it's a close knit community and you're automatically going to be great friends with someone just because they are a redditor too and I just don't think that's the case. 
But hey, I guess Karma is pretty cool. 




 What are you talking about? I'm talking about the 2chan denko thread, which is what the 2 comments above mine were referencing. If you haven't read it, you should do it, it's possibly the most cringy thing on the internet 




 After reading that, I can't help but feel a little sorry for the denko guy he was just naive, a bit off his rocker and incredibly socially maladjusted(not that that excuses any of his behavior). Her shitty friend on the other hand, was the true villain who knew exactly what she was doing, what a sociopath.  




 Honestly, whenever something like this happens I just type the acronym into google and the meaning of the it pops right up at the top.

 Any idea how big the DC metro area is compared to say, the Atlanta metro area? How long does it take to drive to DC from NOVA?

Also I've always heard DC is the one of the most dangerous cities in the US? Any idea how it compares to say Atlanta? In case you can't tell I live in ATL so I'm just trying to get a reference 




 You're a true hero... Is this all in Austin?

 Too lazy to think of a title and stuff... you can do it if you want 




 Here's a video of the paint being added http://vimeo.com/45021408 




 I would think  it's possible that dogs are innately able to recognize some human aspects better than animals because of the thousands of years of selective breeding. It would be interesting to take at look at the difference of response in wild dogs.

The way dogs naturally communicate puts a lot of emphasis on the tone of the barks and other vocalizations so I would think they would have some response. My guess is the wouldn't understand what is trying to be conveyed as well because they don't understand what different tones signify for humans. 




 No... pitch has nothing to do with volume, it is how deep or high pitched your voice is. It's kind of hard to define tone now that I think about it, I guess it's the way you say things so I guess tone depends on your cadence. 




 I like HotWheelz personally 




 Yes but .001 is not equal to .001%. .001 is equivalent to .1%. If you were trying to get 1% of something you would multiply that something by .01. 5% you multiply by .05. 90% you multiply by .9.

I know how to do basic math maybe you should take a second to actually read what I'm saying 




 That's .1%! To get 1% of something you multiply by .01 not 1 




 This is wrong... just because a pattern is random and non-repeating doesn't mean it contains everything...  




 Actually .001% of 7 billion is 70000 




 What are you talking about 




 I was just talking about this particular reference to Gloria 




 It's from the show Modern Family 




 I had a friend in college who completely went off the deep end. Gradually over the course of a couple weeks he got farther and farther removed from reality. He bought his close friends all kind of gifts that there was no way he could afford, completely destroyed his apartment, writing all over the walls and trashing it, and was convinced people we after him. He even thought at one point he had created a light saber and the FBI had broken into his house and stole it. He moved out of his apartment and began living on a volleyball court behind our fraternity house(he was a brother too) in a tent. This all climaxed when he took off all his clothes and started walking around the house naked with a knife in his hands. Scary stuff, the mind is a delicate thing. 




 Some people equate legality with safety. They think oh if it's legal it must be safer than actual weed when the reality is very much the opposite.

 I doubt that local business in Africa would be able to compete with mass produced cheap clothing anyways... It's not like if they didn't donate these shirts, all mass produced clothing would stop making it to Africa.

 My direction in life is not too bad. I'm taking a semester off now but will graduate in the fall with a masters in biomedical engineering. I have severe anxiety and have don't really have any friends back home which is where I am now. I'm a bit social inept and a lot of times I have trouble holding conversions especially which people I don't know. It's hard to find hobbies because everything I once enjoyed doesnt seem interesting due to the depression. I am trying to work my way out of this, have been on anti depressant for 5 years but the only thing that makes me actually be able to enjoy life is opiates and obviously thats not an option.

Something is just wrong with my brain chemistry I think. Even back in the when my first hook up was with the girl who ended up prom queen I still thought about suicide alll the time 




 After being incredibly depressed over half my 23 year old life, it makes me jealous as fuck 




 I'm the same way. I couldn't stand to think how my family would react. I don't want to die so much as just never have existed in the first place. I guess being chronically depressed for over half my life will do that to you 




 Those speed holes do wonders 




 He's never seemed super full of himself to me, is there a story behind this? 




 I could definitely see him being a dexter style serial killer and he'd be fucking good at it too with his crazy work ethic 




 And he appealed the decision and was later acquitted! 




 Ah yes, the old Siemen's tower next to Dick's sporting goods in Cumming

 It's too bad what happened to Hartman. I'm not sure if it's fair to blame Andy Dick for his death, he's certainly a bit responsible but he never had any intention to hurt anyone. Still you don't fucking offer a recovering addict drugs

 Not saying I believe in aliens or anything but I've never understood the "why" question about aliens visiting us. This is a planet absolutely filled to the brim with life not to mention intelligent life. I imagine that would be a bit of a rarity. 




 Look up sleep paralysis. What you described seems very similar to that(although I'm sure it was still terrifying!)  




 I've heard pretty lights has/had a big OC problem and  would often refuse to go onstage if he wasn't high. Know anything about that?

 WHAT SOME OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD LOOK SIMILAR 




 Yeah that's actually what I meant to include as a counter to his point but I just now realized what I posted actually seems like evidence of his point, time to edit 




  A "prisoner" begged to leave and Zimbardo allegedly "encouraged" him to stay to the extent that the prisoner returned to the other prisoners, telling them that, "we aren't allowed to leave". There were also other instances where people were kept against their will and not because of social embarrassment.

From http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1pt80c/psychological_experiments_gone_horribly_wrong/cd5w6k7

It seems he "encouraged" participants to stay but did not say you're allowed to leave. According to a reply to this post a couple student actually did leave the study.
 




 I was born in Poughkeepsie. Glad to know my hometown is keeping up the good work 




 I remember seeing this book sitting on the coffee table at home and seeing the cover. A little bit of me died that day, life was never the same and it definitely didn't help my fear of the dark, although I was more scared of being abducted by aliens than anything else.

I was a strange child. That alien phobia never quite went completely away and I've told friends about it recently. If they ever play a practical joke on me involving aliens I honestly would freak the fuck out. Especially if it was anything like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl8lnZjMcos

 That drop kick has a better spiral than I can throw damn 




 "I did not sow, I did not spin,

And thanks to pills I did not sin.

 I loved the crowds, the stink, the noise. 

And when I peed, I peed turquoise. 

I ate beneath a roof of orange; 

Swung with progress like a door hinge.

 'Neath purple roof I've come today 

To piss my azure life away. 

Virgin hostess, death's recruiter, 

Life is cute, but you are cuter. 

Mount my pecker, purple daughter 

All it passed was sky-blue water."

Little easier to read that way. 




 What's the legality of doing something like that? I'm guessing just a scummy legal thing to do but if you were say to have those posts/emails linked to you conclusively would there be any legal recourse?

 His best part has to be Frank's cape wearing lawyer though 




 Yeah it makes you wonder did score try to account for that or just get kind of lucky? 

I'm pretty good at skill shots and most times I'll just throw them where I think the enemy will be. I'm sure a lot of variables contribute to where I place them but aiming the shot happens so fast I could never really explain my thought process, only that I felt the player would move there so I aimed there. I wonder if it's the same type of deal. 




 Amazing. If cait would have just kept running instead of trying to dodge it, it would have probably missed but that instinctive dodge when you see the ult appear is really hard to control

 I go to school at Georgia Tech, but I'm from Texas and honestly Atlanta is still worse in terms of racism. I think it has something to do with the large black population of the city, especially in the areas around campus which are significantly worse off. I think it has a lot more to do with socioeconomic status than race but around here black and poor really do seem to go hand in hand and this stereotype is often re-enforced. 




 Looks like its going down down in an earlier round  




 Ah cool figured it was a BB or something. I put it first cause i thought it was the coolest looking.

 Yeah considering drug legalization doesnt effect addiction rates [^1](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/120718/drug-decriminalization-portugal-addicts), it is much better for people to get unregulated black market drugs than regulated, pure drugs which they would be using anyways.  




 For me a bad trip on acid(never had a bad one on shrooms) is kind of like taking the anxiety and uncomfortable feeling I get when I'm too high or in the wrong environment and multiplying it by 10. I've tripped probably at least 40 times, the last time over a year ago. That was such a bad trip I had to leave my friends because I was paranoid and was at the point where my mind was racing too fast to even be able to form coherent sentences. By the time I wanted to say something, my mind was already somewhere else so anything I said would have be incoherent babble.

I've also convinced myself I was crazy a couple times and that this time I had taken it too far, taken too much acid and I was never gonna come back down. Those trips sucked a lot but a good trip on acid is equally as mind blowing, in an opposite, amazing way.

TLDR: Acid is a hell of a drug  




 Admittedly, I do not know much about linguistics but languages fascinate me. Years ago, when I was in high school I remember browsing the wordreference forums where a similar question was asked and there were some languages with properties that astounded me.

I can't contribute, studying languages unfortunately took a back seat to engineering for me after high school but I figured this would be the best place to ask. 

I may xPost to askReddit if this gets enough interest.

Just have to point that out considering you did it five times 




 Here ya go 
 Because the liberal left has convinced everyone that McCarthy was as bad as Hitler. The dude was pretty much right, and the rise of state-owned assets and banking which is a component of socialist thinking is what led to the crisis we're in right now. Most Americans, and redditors for that matter, can't accept that voting people in to spend other people's money regardless of whether or not they deserve that money could lead to a shortage of that money and a resistance to hiring to spend that money.

 I was at Bonnaroo one year when he was headlining the last day(think it was 2011?) which means he was the only show at the time at a festival of 100,000+ people. So, a fucking huge crowd to say the least and one of my favorites shows I've ever seen but what really stood out to me was there was a girl in the very front row with a shirt that said "It's my birthday today!!!". He proceeded to call he up on stage in between songs and get the entire crowd(at least 80,000 people) to sing her happy birthday. He has always seemed like the most down to earth celebrity and that just cemented it for me. 




 If you get this up in arms about bow hunting you need a reality check... Nature is fucked up, humans are fucked up and neither you or anyone else are ever gonna change that. Hope self perceived moral superiority makes you happy 




 I understand the dislike of people killing for fun with guns but for food with bows and arrows? Like people did for hundreds of thousands of years? The kind of killing that is constantly happening in nature? Granted it's with simple tools, but that's kinda our equivalent to a bear's claws and strength.
