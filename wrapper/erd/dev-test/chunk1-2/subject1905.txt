 I dunno, that stud on the left has that Chris Farley thing going on. Pretty sure he's also a famous athlete. 




 I've seen them at my local Sports Authority. They seem nice enough with decent quality. It's hard to tell until you try them on and see how they fit and how well they grip.

I think people recommend the Addidas and Nike because it's what they know not necessarily because it's the best shoe.
 




 Depending upon what they are used for it might make more sense to put them on the inside.

Back when I was a kid loading UPS trucks in college we used to two those with our fingers just to mess with them. It made it look like the package was mishandled when it wasn't. 

When you make it obvious that you don't trust the people doing your work they will probably mess with you. 




 I am if you want me to be. :-) 




 You can still buy those on ebay. I think the memory of them is better than the reality. But everyone at school used to have one of those. 




 lol....That's exactly what being a dad is about.  




 Wow! You look fantastic! 




 Saw this a while ago and was really impressed. Thanks for sharing this. 




 Didn't Chris Hanson already do this? 




 I'm honestly not sure how you could say it was boring. It was predictable for certain. But it was certainly action packed.  




 Typically I'll do some back work like face pulls or rows. I also like doing some ab sets.

But as long as you're not taking up 10 minutes between sets who cares what you're doing? 




 Pacific Beach. It's in front of the Mossy Nissan dealership, I saw it last night on my way to the gym. I had to look twice. 




 It's not creepy if you just give advice then back off. You could say something like "I've done the same thing, what worked for me was to lower the hooks".

For the record, I back into the bar too depending upon the rack I'm using because I hate looking into the mirror. 
























 I'll have to look for Ripper Street. 




 I highly doubt it would be able to get a lucky shot. Modern tanks move and engage way too quickly. Even if a WW2 tank was lucky enough to surprise a modern battle tank it would not be able to fire quickly enough to engage. And no WW2 tank could take even a glancing blow from a modern 120mm. 




 I've been watching the BBC show "Copper". It's a good crime drama set in NYC during the Civil War.

I watched the WWII drama "Generation War" and really liked it as well. It's a three part series with each episode running approx 90 minutes.

Both are avail on Netflix streaming.
 




 Congrats, great work!

What are your goals for 2015? 




 If that's the worst thing they find then you're doing well....lol.

Just never tell them the real story. Nobody wants to hear about how their parents tie each other up! :-) 




 I see what you did there..... 




 Some of those were really good. Nice find. 




 lol...no, not the Onion. Just a really poor law. 




 Nice ending. 














 It's OK to hate a lift. If you don't compete then don't do it. If you do compete then just accept that you're going to hate it. 




 According to the graphic it's from  Matthew White, "The Great Big Book of Horrible Things"

 That's a great frame of reference. It would be cool to see both superimposed somehow.
