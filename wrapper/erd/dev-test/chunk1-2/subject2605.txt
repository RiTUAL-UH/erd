 Is your friend on Reddit? You mentioned it was inspired by depression, which is the main reason I like it; I have clinical depression, too. I'd like to know the story behind it if he's comfortable sharing.

 The pic reminds me of AC3. 




 Why is this a thing?! 









 I'll allow it. 
























 Mine is an 08. 














 Your friend, sir, is a bad ass. 









 Congrats man stay strong! 




 I'm so sorry for your loss.

 Yeah I'm on medication. It took years to figure out what worked. But life is pretty good now. I hope your friend gets the help he needs. Tell him I'm rooting for him. I'll definitely let you know if I get his drawing as a tattoo. Does he have any other drawings? 









 You are truly a saint.
