 This is incredible! 




 Kipper. I loved his super grown-up British accent. 




 OMG I LOVE THIS SHOW!!! I would probably still watch it today if I could find it. 




 Wait. Lego LoTR is for kids?

 At first I thought he was standing backwards over his bike. 




 I came here to say there's a good pun in here somewhere. This was it. Thanks, redditor. 




 TIL the meaning of the word "scause". 




 Been in that sub now for an hour. Thanks. 




 Good lord. 




 Thanks for being the source of my internet failure this morning, OP. 




 It took me a good minute to figure out what was going on here. 




 I saw this while laying in bed last night and immediately regretted my decision to be on reddit at 3am. 




 I made myself a busy person. Job, school, two companies, significant other, friends who will still come back if I ignore them for a while. I only really get bored on the weekends when I'm trying my best to ignore my work email. 




 OP what are you, gender-wise?

I only date men, but I'm attracted to other women almost as equally. 




 "If you were a true psychopath you wouldn't ever admit it"
or
"You can't be a sociopath because you do xyz-thing-that-normal-people-do"

Bitch shut the fuck up. It took me years of therapy to be able to admit it and start doing normal things and unless you have an advanced degree in abnormal psychology, I don't want to hear your opinionated "facts" about what ASPD/psychopathy is or is not. 




 Can we please go back to this tradition? 




 I-95 south to 295 south, then went the wrong way on 64. Apparently 64 and 295 meet up more than once? 295 always confuses me because I always seem to be taking 295 south, regardless of which way I'm traveling. 




 I have 600+ hours in the Elder Scrolls series. 




 It's a drive I've done a few times, so I didn't bother with the GPS. I was running on maybe 6 or 7 hours of sleep since Friday morning, and had worked 37 hours over the course of two and a half days, so my brain was not anywhere near working properly. 




 I just drove home from an extremely exhausting weekend event. This was suppose to be a four hour drive, and it turned into nearly six and a half, with no stops and no traffic.

I get on the highway to go home, heading south. About 45 minutes in there is a junction and I can either take I-64 East or I-64 West. In my exhausted state, it somehow makes sense for me to go east. I'll note here that I live in southwest VA. So I'm driving along and I see a sign that tells me VA Beach is around 65 miles away or something like that. That should have been my first clue. But instead of wondering why I'm being told how far away VA Beach is when I'm suppose to be traveling away from it, I think "Oh cool I'm close to VA Beach, maybe I'll stop there!" And I keep driving. **For an hour.** Finally, I see a sign about the infamous bridge-tunnel, and that's when the red flags start going up in my head. I very slowly realized my mistake. It was not a good realization. I was already exhausted and just wanted to be home, and I'd just added two hours, at least, to my trip. Also wasted a quarter tank of gas. I angrily turned around and made my way home.

tl;dr Went the wrong direction on the highway, didn't realize for an hour. 




 Example: boyfriend texts me to go pick him up. I'm sitting on reddit writing a particularly lengthy comment. I text him back with a lie, saying that I was finishing up a work email and would be on my way in a minute. I didn't even think about it; I just said it.

Anyone else lie about the most asinine things for no reason at all? 




 I usually become suspicious of somewhen when I notice their reactions to things. I think a huge tell (and one that's really hard for me to fake) is the reaction to a bad situation. Example: my friend left my apt the other night, I immediately got into bed because I was exhausted. Friend knocks on door and says car has been towed. I'm just like "well that sucks. Goodnight". I assume normal people would want to help or something. I got called out on that. So if I see someone have a reaction like that when they should be more engaged, it throws a flag. Then I observe their other behavior and figure out if I think they are part of the 1% or if they just have trouble dealing with certain situations.

Also ITT: "let's argue about how many psychopaths we may or may not come in contact with." C'mon guys, we've been doing so well lately. The reality of it is this: the best guess that science can give is that 1% of the population suffers from some severity of ASPD. That's 1 in 100 people. In a typical day you will probably come into contact with more than 100 people, assuming you do things like go to lunch at a restaurant or work in a building with other people or walk around a college campus, etc. I think the more valid point is that you don't directly interact with over 100 people a day. So while the likelihood of you being in close proximity with a psychopath is not terribly low, the chances of you actually befriending one is slim. 




 It's less mood and more preference. I hate the cold. I hate the rain. I want it to be 75ºF and sunny at all times. When it deviates from that I don't like it. It doesn't change my mood though. 




 You're literally just naming suicide missions. 




 **This is the greatest story I've ever seen in this sub.**

I'm usually the bitch who's guilty of sweater-stealing (I think I have three that belong to the boyfriend right now), and I'm assuming she's not a psychopath, so I have nothing good to offer.

Please keep us updated on how this turns out. 









 The article cuts off the reason why the people who beat up the gay couple can't be charged with a hate crime. Anyone know the reason?

 Yep, pretty much this. 









 Hi all. New to the sub. I've never actually been involved in any migraine help community and I don't actually know anyone else who is afflicted.

I've been having weekly migraines since I was a teenager. I read a lot about going into a dark, quiet room and laying down, but that never seems to make a difference. I noticed a while back though that I seem to be temperature sensitive. During the migraine, I go through hot and cold changes. One minute I'll be burning up and having cold sweats and then the next I'll be shivering, like the cold is coming from the inside and no amount of sweatshirt or blanket can make me warm..

Also, laying down makes everything worse. I find that the pain is most manageable when I'm standing or walking around. I spend a lot of time pacing the floor.

Do these things happen to anyone else? Any opinions or tales from experience? Dunno if it's helpful or not, but I'm on sumatriptan 50mg. 




 We see it all the time. Someone tapping their foot or fingers to the music in their car, or even music in the doctor's office waiting room. Why is that? 




 Here's the background: for as long as I can remember (at least as young as 10 years old) my ears have felt clogged up. I try to yawn or move my jaw around or hold my nose while blowing to try and get them to pop, but they won't. Sometimes I have autophony. When I try to make them pop, I just hear some crackling, like they're trying to, but the pressure won't equalize. I can't go under 5-6 feet of water without it being excruciating because the pressure won't equalize. Oddly, I have zero problems with flying. It's extremely uncomfortable and I just want my ears to be normal. I've had hearing tests done and I have no loss of hearing. They've tested the pressure behind my eardrum and found it to be normal.

I've been to 4 ENTs. The first 2 told me I had allergies and told me to take daily Claritin and stay indoors. Tried daily allergy meds for a few months with no change. Staying indoors is not an option. I've never had allergy problems in my life, but I was willing to give anything a go. After that didn't work, ENT told me I would just have to live with it. Third ENT told me the same thing.

Fourth ENT was the first to actually try real solutions, and even though he couldn't fix me, I still thank him enormously for trying. He put me on two months of steroid nasal spray. When that did nothing, we decided to undergo the placement of tubes in my ears. I had that surgery three weeks ago. There is still no change. At my follow-up yesterday he has now told me there's nothing else to be done. He says sometimes the nerves send a signal of fullness to the brain so that it feels congested when it's really not. I can't accept this, because then the water depth wouldn't be an issue and I wouldn't get that crackling sound when I move my jaw around. Also, the autophony probably would not be an issue if it was just pesky nerves.

reddit, there must be something to be done. The congestion makes me want to stab holes in the side of my face as if that would help relieve it, and it feels like this all day, every day, for the past 15 years at least. I will answer any questions that may help solve this mystery.

Please help! 
























 I have both a MBA and a MBP. I need to transfer the same set of files to 250 USB drives. I've been doing Google searches for good software to complete this, and everything I've found is either Windows only, or it's designed for hard drive back-ups. Any software suggestions? Thanks! 
























 I use the two-finger trackpad gesture to go to the previous web page (quick for looking at pictures and such). Worked fine for the three weeks I've had this laptop. Installed RES 10 minutes ago and now it's not working. It causes Safari to freeze the current web page. The program itself works fine, other tabs that are open are not affected, but the tab that I'm in to try to swipe back freezes, regardless of if it is reddit or not. When it freezes, it moves maybe 10 pixels to the right, as if it's started to swipe back, and then sticks there and becomes unresponsive. I'm unable to open a new tab or navigate away from the current page. If it's the only tab open I have to restart Safari. I am able to close out of the affected tab.

 I'm in the States. I have a tiny portfolio, partly because I can't really share the stuff I've done for the company I work for. I do front-end development/design work. I specialize in HTML5 and CSS3, with some jQuery thrown in for things I can't accomplish in CSS. I can do enough PHP for an email contact form. I would like to do personal/resume websites or small business pages, mainly static pages, but any opportunity I can take to help build a good portfolio would be appreciated.

 I'm creating a video in iMovie 10 that needs to play as portrait on an iPhone 5. I can't find a way to make the video the correct size/aspect ratio. It needs to be 9:16 (I'm pretty sure). I really would just like to be able to crop the sides off the picture. Any advice or help? TIA. 




 My boss has tasked me with doing video editing, and seeing as I'm a programmer, I have zero clue about what I'm doing. I've watched enough YouTube tutorials to know how the software works, but now I'm getting into the content and I'm lost.

There is around 30 minutes of work-out video and I need to cut it down to a 30-ish second preview. There is only one camera angle, and it's relatively wide. I have no control over filming; I just get the finished videos handed to me from above.

There are over 20 series' I need to do this for. I'm using iMovie 10.0.3 on a MacBook Air.

What should I be looking to pull into a preview? Just playing around with the first series I managed 23 seconds, including a 4 second title. I just took a few seconds here and there showing different movements and with the trainer saying motivating or explanatory things, and crossfaded them together. Now I'm stuck on how to end it, and I really don't think the current 23 seconds that I have is any good. This is content that will be pushed to clients, so I need it to be at least halfway decent.

Everything I find by doing a Google search relates to movie editing and things with different camera angles and lots of dialogue and none of it is relevant. Any tips or advice is much needed and greatly appreciated. 




 "“A lot of doctors and other mental health professionals just throw up their arms, and say, ‘What’s the point of even identifying antisocial personality disorder? What are we going to do with these people?’” said Donald W. Black, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City."

Not even the mental health professionals know what to do with us.

Also, that is the longest name of a university department college I have ever seen.

[Article here](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/04/06/surprising-myths-facts-about-antisocial-personality-disorder/)
It's an article titled "Surprising Myths  Facts About ASPD". I'm not sure if the article is worth the read, mainly because I doubt the validity of some of the data. Maybe worth a skim through. 





























 I'm not a particularly active person, but I'm not out of shape by any means. I do this thing every now and then where I'll run a mile and some every day or two, over the course of maybe a week, and then I stop for a month (or three). Is there any actual long-term benefit to doing this? I lack motivation to get into a runner's habit (working on that) and every now and then I get on a running kick. To put it in perspective, I use the Nike Run app and it tells me I've only run 11 miles so far this year. I tried to find some article to post, but no luck. 




 I'm pretty drunk. Thank god for autocorrect. I also just discovered video Snapchat so I think all my friends will either hate me, or be very amused, in the morning.

That is all.

Goodnight Reddit. I'm off to drink another bottle of wine. 




 I've done some reading but have yet to find any good research done on the observed differences in how ASPD presents in each gender. I know it's much more prevalent in men, so most of what I can find online is from the male perspective. What differences, if any, have you noticed when working with ASPD patients of both genders? 




 There have been a few embedded discussions here recently relating to the difference between men and women with ASPD. I've been doing some reading in a few psych medical journals to try and find some concrete research on it, but the majority of the studies use prison inmates. I have found that the current statistics are estimated at there being 1 woman diagnosed for every 3 men.

Has anyone done any research you can share? Or what have you guys observed if you know any ASPD people of the opposite gender? I know we have at least one other active female member on here who I'd like to hear from.

Edit** More info

I posted this over in /r/psychotherapy as well, to see what the therapists and psychology professionals had to contribute. One person said he/she noticed that men usually acted alone, where women usually had an equally antisocial male counterpart. Found that interesting. 




 Slow internet at work, so this is every single one for me. I feel like it takes away from the (supposed) awesomeness to see it before it's fully loaded. 




 I ask because I went to VA Tech and today is the 7th anniversary of the shooting. I went to high school with the shooter and two of the girls who were killed, one of which I knew decently. Because of those things, I always have some semblance of an emotional response to this day, although I can't figure out what it is. Sadness maybe? Remnants of what that day was like? I don't know. My emotional palate is small. Regardless, it's a day I stay away from people because everyone is emotional and doing that whole "we're part of something greater" community thing and I can't stand it. Some people a few years ago wanted me to go to the candlelight vigil at midnight, so I did. I spent the whole time reading everyone else's faces. It was people-watching gold.

I also have the unpopular opinion that 33 Hokies died that day, because I include the shooter in the death count. I said this to one person, once, and will never make that mistake again.

But other shootings and violent acts/natural disasters, I don't feel anything for at all. Boston Marathon, Sandy Hook, hurricanes destroying cities, etc. I have that attitude of, "well, that happened" and I barely give it a second thought. 









 I have a very small, old dog. I've found that I can just feed it and walk it and it doesn't require any attention other than that because he just lazes around the house all day. It's nice because he's barely there, so I haven't had an opportunity to really get bored with it, and he doesn't bother me. It's like having a moving piece of furniture that I have to buy food for.

It should be noted I suppose that I haven't had the desire to harm animals since I was young. People, yes, but I like animals. 




 These are happening naturally.

My first one was about a month ago. I was drifting off, and then my body felt like it was buzzing. It got so intense I could hardly stand it. I assume I entered the dream state at some point while the buzzing was going on because all at once the buzzing stopped and I was floating off of my bed, toward the ceiling. I know it wasn't an OBE because I looked down at the bed and my body wasn't there. I floated until I bumped into the ceiling. I was terrified and mustered all of my strength and screamed, which took me out of the dream. My roommate later told me that he'd heard me scream. I was so scared by what had happened that I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. Instead, I stayed up and researched as much as I could about lucid dreaming.

I was afraid to have another one through the following nights, but enough time passed that I stopped worrying about it, and I wrote it off as a one-time freak occurrence.

Until last night. I was drifting off and felt the buzzing again. Instead of being scared I tried to focus on it. Next I knew, I was floating around and out of my (closed) bedroom window. I dreamed I was exploring a little historical town. I was playing around with running and floating, and just controlling myself in general. The dream was so vivid. Normal dreams for me are blurry, or hazy, but this one was crystal clear, like I was really there on a bright sunny day. I could look around and go where I wanted. It was devoid of other people tho, or any action. It was just a little empty town, and me learning how to control my dream self.

I also noticed that I was aware of what my physical body was doing. I realized in the dream that I could float if I got a running start and kicked my legs, like swimming. I could feel my physical body moving my legs while I was doing that. Or if I turned my head to look at something, I knew my actual head was turning too. It almost felt like a part of me was caught between asleep and awake.

It lasted maybe ten minutes. I came out of it suddenly when I heard someone whisper "hey" in my ear and it sounded like it was whispered into my actual ear, and not my dream-self ear. (Note that I sleep alone.)

I'm very freaked out by the whole experience. I have done some research and looked through r/luciddreaming and noticed that a lot of you do this intentionally. Is it uncommon for it to happen naturally? Any advice as far as controlling it or dealing with it? Is my experience in line with a typical lucid dream? It's a frightening experience for me and any words of wisdom are appreciated.

tl;dr: Started having LD naturally. Freaked out. Help.

 Moves. It's tracks your movement in the background and tells you how many steps you've walked, run, cycled, and driven. Works both with internal accelerometer and GPS, so it works just as well walking around town as it does on the treadmill. It gives you a map of all the places you went and you can tag them (it recognizes businesses, and you can save your home, work, etc). It's nice to see at the end of the day what my normal activity was. I went to an amusement park a few weeks ago and found that I walked a total of 7 miles just walking around the park. It's also very helpful when you were drunk downtown the night before and don't remember which bar you left your tab open at.

 I use SwiftKey on my iPhone. Love it. I mainly like the dark keyboard. 




 Totally agree with all of this. I pay the $10 for Spotify Premium because it gives me access to 99.9% of the songs I would want to listen to, on my phone at all times. It allows me to not have to load my 30+ GB of music onto my phone too, so it's a major storage saver.

Also, the premade Spotify playlists are on point, and the radio is way better than Pandora IMO.

 Music of life*

Silence, my brother. 




 I'm a developer but I need a second one. The issue where I am is that the companies can't even find developers to work for salary, so finding someone who will reliably work for free or even pay into a startup is next to impossible. My area is full of investors and coworking spaces and everything else a startup would need to succeed, but extremely lacking in people wanting to join startups.

I know what you mean though with business people looking for devs for their ideas though. I had someone hit me up once with his idea, which I though was good but not interesting to me personally, but he pretty much asked me to build the whole thing. 




 That would be a helluva lot easier if we didn't live hours apart. I try to get up there as often as I can. I do my best to talk to him and he seems to feel comfortable coming to me when he has an issue or when mother has done something, so that makes me feel better. 




 If I could take my brother in to live with me, it would make me a million times happier, but there is zero chance of that happening. I'd have a better chance of convincing my mom's husband that my brother is in a bad situation and that they need to get out. My step-dad is so easy-going though that he just deals with her shit without seeing how bad it is. 




 Thanks for the input! I've been trying to keep a good line of conversation open with my brother (we live far away from each other) and make him understand that he needs to do his best to not let the things our mother says and does get to him. 




 That's what I was afraid of. She reacts extremely defensively to any and all criticism. 




 Hi all. I'm new to this sub. Someone over in /r/sociopath said I should check it out. I am 100% convinced my mother has NPD; I won't go into the details this time. As a result, I've been diagnosed and stuck with ASPD.

My question is related to getting her the help she needs. I'm in my 20s and have been on my own for years now, so I can just ignore her, but I worry about my kid brother. He's 14 and he's already starting to show the traits for ASPD or other empathy-based personality disorders, and I'm convinced it's because of him growing up with our mother. I don't want to see that happen to him.

Has anyone been successful in getting help for their narcissistic parents? Unfortunately, she's been successful in turning most of the family against anything I have to say, and my diagnosis reinforced that within my family. I'm unsure of how to bring it up with any family members without them telling me I'm crazy or overreacting or something of the sorts. I just really want her to get better so she doesn't fuck up my brother for life. 




 Am I the only one who thought that was an elephant? 




 Precipice has always been one of my favorite words to say.

 Hi. I've recently been involved with Startup Weekend and formed a team, but it fell apart after the event (as many are apt to do). Since then I've been attempting to find founders to make this a thing, with no luck. How did you find people who wanted to work for/with you and who were actually willing to put in a serious amount of commitment? 




 That convo goes like this:

"What are you up to?"

"Nothing"

"Oh cool, let's go do xyzthingIdon'twanttodo"

"No, you misunderstand. I'm doing nothing. Leave me be." 




 Netflix. 




 This makes me uncomfortable. 




 I just want to point out that this is not an issue only affecting big cities. I live in a small town with relatively decent people and it still happens. Not nearly as often as this video portrays, maybe once a week or so, but it's still an issue and it still makes walking around downtown uncomfortable sometimes. I can imagine this is happening in every town all over the country. Thanks OP for the post and raising awareness. 




 Does dogecoin mine off the graphics card like BTC? I have a spare Macbook but I assume I can't mine with that. I'm prepared to buy a computer solely for mining. What should I be considering before making this purchase? Thanks! 




 Oh shit. I'm still on 1.4. That might explain it. This is what I get for not keeping up with things. Sigh. Thanks! 




 My dogecoin wallet has been syncing for close to six months. I thought maybe it was slow internet, so I moved the computer to my office, which is gigabit, and it's still syncing. I've left it alone for three months and it's still going. Please help! 




 Why are fat people offended when we call them out on being fat? I don't get offended when someone tells me I'm short. Jeez.

 Thank you so much for doing this! I was actually in Harry Potter World in Florida over the weekend, so coming home to an AMA by you is great!

So many questions for you already, I hope you get to mine.

Harry Potter was such an integral part of my growing up, and I'm among the many many 20-somethings that followed the series from the first three books and on. As a fan, when the credits rolled on the Deathly Hollows Part 2, the feeling of "it's all over" was overwhelming. How was it for you when the last movie was finished and the series came to an end? 




 I'm sorry but the fact that you said "prolly" instead of "probably" just made my year. 




 I try to be normal in a relationship. I think being open with the other person about my antisocial traits helps that happen. I slip up sometimes. 




 Empathy is when something happens to a person and you feel bad for them or feel what they are feeling. Things happen to other people, even people close to me, and I feel nothing. This doesn't mean I don't care about them. 




 Why would not find things funny? 




 I mainly only sleep with men (I'm female), but I wouldn't be opposed to being with a woman. 




 Therapy got me to be self-aware and the help stopped there. 




 Web design. 




 As I walk slowly back to the car I think: I hope it does.

My favorite line in the whole thing. 




 How old are you? 




 In my state you could lose your gun rights, but that's the only negative I know of. It's also very expensive. It's not like a prison where you don't have to pay for it. It gets billed to your medical insurance and you could end up with a very large bill. 




 In women, borderline and ASPD get confused for each other. 




 I've never cheated. I'm actually extremely loyal in relationships although I imagine I could hide an affair with little to no effort and be successful in it. 




 I don't say "bye" on the phone. I just hang up. In person I hate when my friends want to do the whole 'let's hug goodbye' thing and I'm all, 'I'm gonna see you again in less than 24 hours, why are you acting like I'm going away forever?' 









 This should be the norm. 




 This is my favorite riddle to ask people. Glad to see it on here! 




 It's OK. I'm also 25, with the misfortune of living in a college town. The young people trends are horrendous and make me feel super old. 




 Oh great. It's a yik yak of a joke that's probably from reddit originally. We've come full circle people. 




 Woah, did you just finish Journey? 




 I'm 5'2", so yes I could be a very tall hobbit. I'd be ok with that. 




 Not trolling, and way to only discount a portion of what I said. At the time this article was written, the CDC was still saying we weren't going to get it in the US at all. The operative phrase in your post is "so far". Just one confirmed case is still a start to them happening more and more here. Ebola has an average infection rate of 3 people per infected person, and with an incubation period of up to 21 days, the possibilities are at least mildly troubling.

In a fast-building story like the Ebola coverage is, an article published two weeks ago, let alone two months ago, like this one, is irrelevant.

Do your research. 




 I think self-diagnosis would take hours of research (actual, medical journal research) and an extremely objective look at yourself. 




 I dream every night, and very vividly. Sometimes I lucid dream. 




 What you're saying makes a lot of sense. It's more of a possession thing. When I have someone like that I'll try not to hurt them because I wouldn't want them to leave and not be mine anymore. 




 That's actually the reddit tagline. When the founders were tasked with creating reddit, they were literally told to create "The front page of the internet"

 Not as pricey as some others on here, but once I put my then-bf's Corvette key fob through the washing machine. Ruined it. Cost $250 to replace. He didn't speak to me for a couple of days. 




 Sometimes I eat lunch right before someone invites me to lunch somewhere else. So I eat a second lunch. But I can't just go and sit there and eat a snack. I have to make it look like I was super hungry still, so I eat two full lunches and then want to kill myself and my food baby.

 I'm a self-aware female ASPD person as well, so this is more of a comparison thing.

Being that you're aware of the issue and how it makes you act/feel in society and in personal relationships, are you trying to get better? You say you're seeing a psychologist; do you see a therapist for CBT or anything? I've found that I'm extremely frustrated not having the capacity to have normal human interactions and I'm wondering if you experience the same frustrations.
