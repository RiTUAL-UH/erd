 I looked down at my five dollars and saw the Doctory goodness and just had to make it!

 Im really not familiar with "grades" in America, can someone please tell me how old someone in 9th grade is?

Also, I had a teacher like this in secondary school from year 7 to 9 ish and he was such a racist to this kid (only muslim in class) and it was practically to his face. I guess the kid learnt to just ignore it but because it was our teacher everyone in class was so conflicted. The worst thing about it was that he was our Religeous Education teacher who actually studied to teach history so he was constantly pissed at something. 




 Thats awesome!  




 :D x 















































































 Anyone else red this as "yo mama"? 









 [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybIGOscPtl4 feature=related) is the only real reaction to have.

 I once tried to push two of my girly friends exactly like the bottom frame in reception (preschool) . It did not end well, one got a black eye and the other a bleeding nose. Whilst I got a phone call home from my teachers. To this day I have no idea why I did it.  









 Have you thought about starting your own business in perhaps something similar? 
If not...off the top of my head:

Becoming a lecturer in film and TV production at a college, university or running classes.

Graphic design advertising business? Something maybe more creative based.

Not many examples but I hope I sparked some inspirational mind magic for you! all the best! Also, just so my curiosity doesn't get the better of me which films and such have you produced?

Also, if your not too busy, I am just starting a course at the London College of Fashion doing Technical Effects for performance. I was just wondering do you have any advice on how to get into the prop makers department? Thanks :) x x x  
 




 That is fantastic! It must take a very long time to create each piece?
 




 All I know now is that this is the best [kindle](http://www.thefoosballwizard.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/lots_of_kittens.jpg) ever!
