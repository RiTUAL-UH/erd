 No, not at all! He's just a jokester 




 Thanks a lot! 









 Is there an official tier list? 




 Does anyone know how to make the score list that long? 




 You have your hobbies, and we have ours 




 Friday because everybody is lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend 




 Pokmon because I HAVE TO CATCH 'EM ALL 




 Off-topic, how did you get the score chart to show every score instead of just eight with a scroll bar? 




 It's all fun and games until a deer head falls on you. 




 Pichu and Daisy 




 Off topic, but what is that box with all of the civilizations' emblems at the bottom of the screen, and how do you enable it?

 Are the mega evolutions likely to be final smashes? 




 Do the 3ds pictures just look like this because it is supposed to be "3d" or will they actually have a different appearance than the wii u game?

 I can have her in boxes whenever it's a good time.

 How many hybrids can I have? 




 Do you have any of these pictures? Gwen, Savannah, Antonio, Simon, Rooney, Limberg, Anabelle, Flo 




 I have apple moving soon. What items and hybrids do you have? 




 Oh nevermind. Lol 




 Wait, was there something to cram for? 




 If a villager moves out of my town, and I get a different version of the same villager from another town to move in, will they act like they remember me? 




 Okay, I'll be right over! 




 I'll take her if you get no response! 




  town* in the first line 




 So I pretty much played out my tone a few months ago and got bored, and I'm thinking of restarting my town. I want to get back into the game. However, I put a lot of work into this town and love all my villagers. Should I restart?
