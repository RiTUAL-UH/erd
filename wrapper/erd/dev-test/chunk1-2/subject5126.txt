 7/10 




 Ha! Personally I think monogyny is overrated anyway.  Don't let society pressure you into having to have a bf if it's not what you want. But you're hot, so I'm sure getting what you want shouldn't be a prob! 




 You're young and beautiful.  Please don't go putting on a lot of makeup.  You don't need it and I see so many girls killing they're natural beauty by wearing paint. Also, at 6'4" - I can really appreciate a tall beauty.  9.5/10 




 You're hot. 8/10.  Why do you think you've never had a bf?   




 You're so cute! 7/10 




 Is this thing the size of a truck or is that guy just *really* short? 




 That wasn't a question. It's not efficient to work employees to the point where they kill themselves.  




 8/10 - I'd smash 




 If you're a company making your employees work 100hr weeks you need to create two jobs and hire two people.  Gah. 




 Really. You are a joke and you're hilarious. In a sad way. The other comments ring true and honest. The fact is that I have very high self esteem, I frequently get requests to model, and I'm drowning in pussy. Maybe a slight narcissism exists but there is nothing 'quite tragic' about seeking approval and showing off ones hard earned abs in this sub is to be expected.  Btw; you're full of shit with your obvious contradiction:
 I wouldn't say you're ugly because that is unfair

vs

 you can't accept that you're ugly

You're pathetic.  Get help. 




 Hard work pays off.  Good job. 




 Good one. 




 Enough about some president that was before our lifetime.  Are you on Mount Rushmore?  How will you be forgotten?   




 6/10.  Do some squats or something. 




 Velcro wallets: age 10

Drinking too much: age 25

Not caring about your health: age 30 




 You're a handsome fellow.  7.5/10 




 Athletic high (runners, swimmers, fighters, etc). 




 Carb filler: Brussels Sprouts.  I just eat them raw.  They have a ton of fiber, + some protein, and they fill you up fast and keep you full. 




 You're hawt!  Nice thigh gap.  9.5/10 




 Porn magazines. 




 I agree.  That can't be working for her.  She'll either have to be less of a bitch or be hotter. 




 Stop making a duckface.
That piercing is not flattering at all.
Go with your natural hair color.
6/10 




 I'd eat your ass. 




 It must suck being fat, ugly, and generally unattractive.   




 Undercover shitlord.  I get it. 




 Don't as for honesty if you can't take it.  You're fat, ugly, and age terribly.  Honesty. 




 3/10.  You look like you're in your late 30's.  And you're fat.  And this picture is of horrible quality.   




 Hi.

The website asoftmurmer.com works wonders for me. 




 You're beautiful.  9/10. 




  Step 4: Get new glasses. Those are too small on your face.

OR; get a smaller face.  Your face is too big for your glasses.   




 You look like you're 40.  Are you balding?  
I have a fix: Consume less than you expend (talking calories here).  Repeat this behavior consistently until you are no longer obese.  Then consume as much as you expend.  
 




 Why you Russian, are you late for something? 




 8. I like the bangs but that just might be b/c I live in BK. 




 Good at Google. 
























 People who put raisins in cake should be prosecuted by cake courts.   




 That's a solid vice. 




 I'm literally at work. 




 That took a lot, didn't it? 




 Two for cake. 




 Nice.  I like it.  I have one of the flagship year Mazdaspeed 3's but I'm not super into fixing it up...probably b/c I live in a city and almost never drive. 




 What kind of cake? 




 Books! Now I'm picturing Johnny-5 tearing up a library, shaking a bit from the large dose of books. 









 That is a proper full sentence.  Please learn English, bot. 









 You're doing great! 




 Bruce Banner   




 I got in trouble for throwing an apple core into a heavily wooded apple on school property because I was "littering."  It isn't literally littering.   




 Who orders soda?  Beer please. 




 ( ) 




 /r/fatpeople is also decent 




 I thought it was all the obese mods being butthurt. 




 I can just crush arugula.  It's a vegetable.   




 TIFU

The titles are always misleading that anyone can relate to.

TITLE: "TIFU by going to the grocery store"

TEXT: "I walked around with my cart of groceries, texting, and didn't see the guy on the ladder who I bumped into causing him to fall and knock over a case of soda!"

REALITY: You fucked up by bumping into some dude because you weren't paying attention.  The fuck up was NOT going to a grocery store. 




 It was so *underground* then! 




 I think you're beautiful! 9.5/10 




 Will a hipster still buy its album? 




 Hi. I spent 4 years in the Navy.  During this time, I was required to do a lot of swimming for my job and I also did long distance running (halfs   fulls) in my spare time.  I also lifted heavy.  

Generally gains   distance do not go well together.  I found it almost impossible to keep on weight from lifting.  I was eating A LOT and still, weight would just fall off. I'd be waking up several hours before a race to consume a crap load of high hypoglycemic carbs to fuel throughout the run and dumping on proteins afterwords.

If you're going to prepare for this, know that you will likely lose mass.  On a side note; it's not very good for your joints to carry a lot of mass when doing distance.   




 Beautiful. Fit. Tall? 10/10. 




 Good one. 




 You do not look 19.  Currently 6/10.
Some suggestions: Your skin looks dry.  Try cocoanut oil, this might help you look closer to your age too.  You look sad.  Smiling, even if it's forced, makes us happy.  Try it.  And don't just smile with your mouth, smile with your eyes.   




 Do you actively seek a girlfriend?  What kind of girls are you going for? 




 9/10 - so hot. 




 The odds of me contracting a severe STD, based off of the demographics that I date, are roughly 1 in 100,000.  I'll take those odds.  How's your personality treating ya?  Can't get a bf but you're not fat or ugly?  Good luck with that. 




 Haha, yea man, thanks. Keep being awesome! 




 Dude, when I was your age I used to think of all these things I could do to look older.  Be patient really is a virtue and it *will* pay off.  

I'm m31 living in NYC. I didn't stop growing until I was like 24 and didn't get my true confidence until maybe 27 but now, it's like I can have any girl I want. I love it.

Keep up the gym, stay active, stretch and above all, just believe in yourself - life can get SO awesome! 




 6.5.   




 You look very young and as a fellow young looking late bloomer I can affirm that you can definitely benefit from this later in life.  7/10. Get in shape and you'd be more like a 9.
