 I think there can be differences of opinion about what the 2nd Amendment is about, but do even those who believe it's about the freedom of individuals to arm themselves against a tyrannical government believe that that right is absolute, and that every person in the country should be able to build an arsenal of every conceivable kind of weapon, regardless of the firepower of the weapon or the criminal history or mental competence of the individual? 









 GalantGuy, I agree that the issue is more complex than simply banning assault weapons and I appreciate your reasonableness and civility. I am in favor of being as reality-based, scientific, and results-oriented as possible in trying to solve the problem. 

Studies have shown that violent video games and movies don't seem to increase a person's propensity for killing other people, as does the common-sense observation that they obviously have those things in countries with much lower rates of violence. 

I don't think it's practical to have an armed policeman at every entrance to every school in the country, plus in school parking lots, sporting events, etc. Even if we could do that, kid-shooters could just go elsewhere, like parks, Little League games or Chuckie Cheese.

I don't go for stop and frisk or TSA style screenings. 

I agree that all these measures are overkill. The whole country shouldn't be on lockdown to guard against a relatively few nuts. I do think improved access to mental health and more realistic reporting laws on dangerously unhinged people might help, but even then you have family members who are enablers or in denial, like Nancy Lanza. 

It just seems more logical to me to make the weapons that are designed to kill a lot of people quickly unavailable. I don't see why anyone outside of the military or law enforcement would need those weapons. Mass shootings would still occur from time to time with non-automatic weapons, but at least the killers would be less efficient and a few more people would live.

If we had a way to prevent lightning strikes, wouldn't we try to do that?

 




 I'll concede on that. 




 I think they are all gun deaths and that is what that particular report was measuring, rather than deaths from violent crime.


 



















 I agree that pro-gun control citizens should get off their duffs and call their legislators too, especially because they are in the majority in this instance. If they don't and legislation fails, it will be their own fault. 




 No it doesn't. No one has to turn in their guns. 




 If I were reading a report on drownings I'd expect to see accidental drownings and suicide drownings as well as any murder-by-drownings, so if I'm reading a report on gun deaths I would expect to read about accidental and suicide gun deaths as well as murder gun deaths. 




 They do indeed. 




 I guess it's the thought of some guy blasting his prey full of holes that seems a case of overkill, literally, and not really sport. 




 "You'll never stop them completely, and it is tragic, but at the same time, we need to realize that very few people die in these kinds of shootings."

Tell that to those Newtown parents.
 




 It's "family's." And they are not. But if you think your family is in as vulnerable a position as the family of the leader of the free world, you either have a very inflated sense of your own importance or you are very paranoid. Maybe both. 




 You're not the first person to ask me that question. 




 I guess those academic and journalistic sources I cited are just making the data up...Look for the raw data by state on the CDC site and then compare them.  









 What kind of gun policy do you support? 




 Are you able to take down your prey with a rifle? 




 Here's a report from Penn that references the CDC sources that are used for this data:
http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ficap/resourcebook/pdf/monograph.pdf

 




 Man, the thought of guys hunting with rapid fire arms is just depressing.  




 Do you shoot a deer with multiple rounds? 




 Gun deaths are gun deaths. Having a gun in the house makes it more likely that a gun suicide will occur, and that an accidental shooting of a family member will occur. I don't think it's unreasonable to include suicides and accidents in gun deaths. 




 Even if you don't buy the 25%, what about the 75%? 









 Are military-style weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines designed for hunting? 




 All gun deaths, I believe. 




 Your day is over, NRA. 




 When exactly are you planning to start the revolution?  




 Brady Campaign is actually a good suggestion. They have a new guy in charge who seems very sensible, thinks we should concentrate on things the NRA membership agrees with, like universal background checks. 




 But why would you take out the per capita? Isn't that what matters? 

Also here is how the Daily Beast arrived at the numbers I linked to above:
"Our methodology was simple: Rather than measure the number of guns, we measured the measure of gun deaths per capita in each state, using the most recent data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That counted for 75 percent of the ranking. The other 25 percent was derived from the Legal Community Against Violence's state-by-state comparison of firearm laws, which ranks all 50 states by their relatively severity, incorporating everything from policies on mental-health background checks to whether loaded guns are allowed in bars." 




 No other president has been asked about having armed guards at every school in the country, so we don't know what they would have said. And btw there was an armed guard at Columbine. 




 Actually, Illinois is #43 out of the 50 states in per capita gun deaths. The states with the highest per capita gun deaths are all pro-gun states:

 All presidents get Secret Service protection for family members. You must know that. 














 I hope Anonymous takes on these conspiracy theorists. 




 These people are revealing what they really are and it is very ugly.

 "The negotiating style Obama has displayed in these instances is what poker players call tight-weak. A tight-strong player avoids throwing in his chips, saving them for a big hand, which he plays aggressively in hopes of a huge win. A loose-weak player plays lots of hands, bluffing frequently. Tight-weak is the worst of all worlds  when you have a weak hand, you lose, and when you have a strong hand, you fail to maximize your position."

Ugh. I foolishly thought Obama had learned his lesson. Guess not. 





























 Case-control studies, ecological time-series and cross-sectional studies indicate that in homes, cities, states and regions in the US, where there are more guns, both men and women are at higher risk for homicide, particularly firearm homicide. 




 "The people who fight and lobby and legislate to make guns regularly available are complicit in the murder of those children. They have made a clear moral choice: that the comfort and emotional reassurance they take from the possession of guns, placed in the balance even against the routine murder of innocent children, is of supreme value. Whatever satisfaction gun owners take from their gunswe know for certain that there is no prudential value in themis more important than childrens lives. Give them credit: life is making moral choices, and thats a moral choice, clearly made."

 Yeah, study after study have shown that they do. Here's one from Harvard: 
http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/index.html 




 But the mass killings are the specialty of young white males -- is that what you are? 




 "We have to make ourselves better. Otherwise, the story from Connecticut is too unspeakable to bear." 




 And yet all these mass killings seem to be perpetrated by young WHITE men, don't they? 

And why would you take "urban demograhics" out of the equation, anyway? Don't people killed with firearms in the cities count as much as people killed by firearms out in the country? The majority of people in the US live in metropolitan areas, you know, something like 83% I believe.

Yes the US firearms murders are cultural -- the result of a culture in which access to guns is easy.

Personman04, try getting your stats from a source that is not a propaganda tool. 




 Great Silver piece that shows how the right has successfully shifted the terms of the discussion of gun control.  




 not true 




 ""...If they [Republicans] have entitlement cuts as part of this deal, they would make it, through their marketing ways, and theyre better communications operatives than Democrats, that the president would own the entitlement cuts. Theyre not worried about that. They would say the president owns that in 2014 and 2016." 




 "This isn't just cognitive dissonance. It's irresponsible reporting." 




 I hope Obama pays attention: "Recent events have also demonstrated clearly what was already apparent to careful observers: the deficit-scold movement was never really about the deficit. Instead, it was about using deficit fears to shred the social safety net. And letting that happen wouldnt just be bad policy; it would be a betrayal of the Americans who just re-elected a health-reformer president and voted in some of the most progressive senators ever." 




 Let's hope you're right and that the news media is all over this. 




 Silver weighs the polls when he aggregates them, taking into account their biases and various leans and their history of accuracy. Not foolproof but safer than any one of those polls alone. 




 Problems with women? 




 Definitely see the McGonagall comparison.  




 And Mitt Romney just released an ad endorsing him. 




 "First, Romney's story about seeking women applicants was a lie. Second, during Romney's tenure at Bain Capital, there were exactly zero women partners (not enough binders?). Third, during his one term as governor, he invalidated a half-dozen executive orders establishing affirmative action policies for women."
 




 He's afraid of The View. 




 "Here's the difference between Biden and Ryan: whereas Biden has been studying foreign policy for many decades (over which he's made his share of mistakes), everything Ryan knows about foreign policy, or at least everything he's shown us he knows, comes from interventionist ideologues with talking points that test well among the base and bear little resemblance to reality." 




 Actually, Ryan is a member of the House of Representatives, not a Senator, and what are you talking about with 43 days?  




 "[the window display of] Skuby   Co. Lifestyle Clothing store in Spring Lake, New Jersey...includes this photo of President Obama as a witch doctor. The store's proprietor, Bill Skuby, tells the Asbury Park Press, 'We deal with a 1 percent customer; they come in here and shake my hand. My business is through the roof because of this.' 




 "...can you even imagine Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh tearing their hair out over a weak debate performance by Mitt Romney the way that liberals have been over President Obama's? I can't." 




 "This is not a poetic rallying cry, but there is human suffering to be minimized and a new foundation to defend." 




 "The furor over Fridays report revealed a political movement that is rooting for American failure, so obsessed with taking down Mr. Obama that good news for the nations long-suffering workers drives its members into a blind rage." 




 "During his time at GE, the company began a system of tweaking their earnings that eventually resulted in a $50 million fine. But just because he oversaw a cooking of the books doesn't mean that's a standard national practice." 




 That is super mature, and not desperate. 




 Something might get done! 




 Thanks. 




 Occam's Razor. Simplest and least convoluted explanation makes the most sense to me. I also think it's telling that conservatives seem to be interpreting Romney's statement the same way I do --it's not just the liberals who see it that way. But as you say YMMV.

I also think it's interesting that even your interpretation starts from the same assumption Romney does -- that people always vote only from their own financial self-interest.  It says a lot about the way his type of conservatives vote. I can't find the stats now, but read earlier today that twenty years ago 80-some percent of Republicans believed in some sort of government support for the poor, as opposed to 40-some percent now. 

I live in a reasonably high-earning household but I don't support the government giving me a tax break and raising the taxes of the elderly, the young, and the poor so that my family can pay less. I believe in the concept of citizenship and the social compact. The kind of concentration of wealth we have now is not good for our country and will strangle our competitiveness if we allow it to continue.  




 "Those Americans who paid payroll taxes, but had no income tax liability, still pay about 15 percent of their income, higher than the 13 percent Romney pays." 




 "Those Americans who paid payroll taxes, but had no income tax liability, still pay about 15 percent of their income, higher than the 13 percent Romney pays." 




 Here are links to some of the problems commentators -- liberal and conservative -- have had with what Romney said:

http://www.memeorandum.com/


http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/romney-unplugged.html

And btw, this sentence --  Ill never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives" would seem to imply that the 47% are indeed lazy. That is an inference a reasonable person would draw from that sentence. 




 I think the more salient detail of the article is the rapacious behavior of the guy's hedge fund. Unfortunately that is not in the mojo headline. 




 "Mitt Romney says citizens who don't pay income tax will never vote for him. But eight of the top 10 states with the highest number of nonpayers are red states."
 




 "A triumph of fact and reason." 




 Reporters and commentariat:  Please read these charts. 




 While I don't disagree that Congress deserves scrutiny, realistically any changes in seats are going to come at the margins.

The race for president is too close for us to take our eyes off it now. Even if it's true that Reddit is overwhelmingly for Obama (which I see you got some pushback on), hopefully we go out and propagate these news stories and opinion pieces elsewhere as well, in addition to just talking to each other. 

If we support Obama, we should be trying to get helpful articles out there to undecided folk, via facebook or links in emails or whatever means we have. It's about convincing the undecided and about getting likely Obama voters to actually get out there and vote.  




 But the Republicans will appeal. 




 Note this quote:
"Quite simply, the Romney campaign isn't adhering to the minimum standards required for a real policy conversation." 




 I don't really think that's true. The tax returns are not analogous to the birth certificate.

It is reasonable to expect candidates for president to release their tax returns. It's not reasonable to expect them to repeatedly show a copy of their birth certificate.

The birthers are extreme fringe types asking something of Obama that has not been asked of any other candidate. Those asking for the tax returns include his primary opponents, journalists, and members of his own party who are just asking for information most candidates provide.

Romney saying he won't release any additional returns because opponents would only clamor for more is an excuse, not a reason. If he were to release even five years of returns, reasonable people would probably not ask for more. 

There is obviously something in those returns he doesn't want people to see.  




 Obama is still giving away the farm before the negotiations even get started. 




 If only "the people" would realize that the supposedly grass roots Tea Party is only a tool for right-wing corporate interests.  If only the mainstream media had more interest in pointing that out.

 Time for Democrats to call our senators and the cowardly hack Sen. Reid. 














 You got that right, dominosci. 









 If the amount paid is lowered by an "average" of $2500, that does not mean that every person's bill will be lowered by $2500. Do you know what an average is?  

The article says that some will pay more, most will pay less. Those who pay more will be getting better coverage that will actually cover ailments or injuries they might get in the future. You can be a 20-something healthy male one day and get cancer or get hit by a car the next.  









 Is it an individual policy? 




 Read the article.  












































 Where have we heard that fraction before? 






















































 "Other states considering similar changes include Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which share a common dynamic with Virginia: They went for Obama in the past two elections but are controlled by Republicans at the state level." 









 Ok, thanks for the correction, I edited my post to make the change. 














 For those saying it would take a constitutional amendment to eliminate the electoral college -- there is another way. 

States are allowed to decide how to apportion their electoral votes. To date, 9 states, representing 139 electoral votes, have passed laws giving all their electoral votes to the winner of the popular national popular vote. 

This movement is called the National Popular Vote Movement, and it is worth working for:

 People who swear and get abusive in their posts are revealing the weakness of their arguments. Military-style assault weapons were developed for use in war, to kill people. They are inanimate objects that are used by people.

"Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal came out in favor of gun control restrictions in a Tuesday morning appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."

"I spent a career carrying typically either a M16, and later a M4 carbine," he said. "And a M4 carbine fires a .223 caliber round, which is 5.56 millimeters, at about 3,000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It's designed to do that. That's what our soldiers ought to carry."

Said McChrystal, "I personally don't think there's any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America. I believe that we've got to take a serious look -- I understand everybody's desire to have whatever they want -- but we have to protect our children and our police and we have to protect our population. And I think we have to take a very mature look at that."

So I imagine the general is wrong, according to you. And you know better. 




 If I cared about knowing the total number of deaths by drownings I would include all deaths by drownings. If you only want to look at murders, then find a report that only looks at murders -- that's not what this one does. But from a public safety standpoint, when talking about regulation, all deaths are more relevant than just murders -- including accidents and suicides. 
























 I think we agree on these points.  




 Lack of heritability is not the same as confiscation. And historically guns have not been confiscated from owners in this country.  




 I have not been shooting but do have a family member who is a hunter. 

In my opinion, the previous assault weapon ban was ineffective because NRA-backed members of Congress inserted a lot of loopholes. 

I'm not an absolutist on an assault ban, though, and think we should get what we can on this issue, such as universal background checks and improved mental health reporting. I predict that the NRA will come out as strongly against universal background checks, though.

I agree on the gang violence -- I think universal background checks, and a trafficking provision, would help there. I live in the Chicago area, and recently read that a large percentage of Chicago gang guns are purchased from third parties who buy them in largish batches from our gun-lax neighbor, Indiana. 
 




 So you acknowledge that the government has the right to regulate what kinds of arms people can have, and what types of people should be allowed to have them. We agree.

Also, you realize that corporations and the 1% get a lot of government handouts by means of tax policy, right?
