McGILLAN, JOHN M. "SHORTY" - Delirium Tremens - Died Aug 22, 1891 - Age 30 Years  

He Never Blamed the Booze! 

His liver needed scraping and his kidneys had the gout, He swallowed lots of bitters 'til at last he cleaned 'em out, His legs were swelled with dropsy 'til he had to cut his shoes, He blamed it to the doctors, but he never blamed the booze! 

Then he had the tremens, and he tackled rats and snakes, First he had the fever, then he had the shakes, At last he had a funeral and the mourners had the blues, And the epitaph they carved him ..."He Never Blamed the Booze!"

"An advisory alert has been issued for a remote  volcano in the western Aleutian Islands after dozens of earthquakes were reported in the area, an early sign of volcanic unrest. 

The change means that five volcanoes being monitored in Alaska are now simultaneously active, the most in recent memory, said Matt Haney, a research geophysicist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. "

Too many quakes from Indonesia to the southern Islands, Chile, Acapulco and volcano related swarms in the Aleutians. 

West Coast, US   Japan needs to be on their toes. 






























































































 /r/StormComing is simply this: an Archive of Earth Changing Disasters and Events, manmade or natural.

It's not a place for HAARPtards, Climate Change Deniers, Flat-Earthers, or Eschatology/Rapturists to post theorems. And as we want to attract sane, logical redditors, we don't want to hear about how radiation is good for everyone.

This sub is best read using 'new' rather than 'hot' or 'top' as it is an archive of events.

We cover these types of global stories:

* Extreme Weather (including watches/warnings), torrential rains, record breaking wind events, temperatures, tornados, hurricanes, etc.

* Geologic: Landslides, earthquakes, sinkholes, etc.

* Floods and flood watches/warnings.

* Solar: Solar Storms that may have impact on Earth.

* Disease: Disease outbreaks of all kinds, including rabies threats.

* Food Recalls.

* Near Earth Objects: Upcoming close encounters with Meteors.

* Mass animal die-offs.

* Nuclear accidents and events.

* Oil and chemical spills/explosions/fires.

* Wildfires.

* Drought and impacts of drought, ie: agricultural impacts, etc.

If you want to add an Earth-changing or disaster story from the news or reliable source, please do. Since headline writers often fail, feel free to editorialize titles to fill in important details from the story- especially the location.

We have already heard from someone who saw a flash flood forecast here that saved them from swimming home from work. Other redditors have been alerted to Tornado Outbreaks and took safety precautions. So we feel we are fulfilling the purpose of the sub.

As /r/StormComing is an archive of events, there is nothing subjective about it. Downvoting anything here would be as stupid as downvoting an encyclopedia entry.

Feel free to x-post to other reddits, especially reddits that are geographically related to the area the event or warning concerns.

If you mod a related sub I'll be happy to share sidebar links. If you would like to co-mod this sub, send me a pm.
 





































































































































































































































 So we have this [giant crack](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2ebs4y/giant_crack_appears_in_earth_in_mexico_i_have/) opening up under the Sonoran Desert, [billions of these odd Jellyfish coming ashore](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2edpuz/billions_of_jellyfish_wash_up_on_beaches_from_san/) between San Diego and British Columbia and now I see [hundreds of microquakes in the Alaskan Peninsula over 48 hours](http://www.aeic.alaska.edu/recent/macsub/). 

All we need are a [few Oarfish to rise to the surface](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/7365076/Oarfish-omen-spells-earthquake-disaster-for-Japan.html) and I will be rolling east by a few hundred miles.

 Nothing, still.

 Over the past year I have been noting rainfall records broken worldwide. People describing these events use the words: torrential, apocalyptic, unusual, extraordinary. I remember an elderly Japanese lady describing one such event (in Japan last year) in this way "The water was coming down so hard I could barely breathe, I felt like I was breathing water."

As stated, I started noting a drastic increase in these events last year- out of past 40 years of serious weather watching. 

[Here is the post I made on it 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/1jzh7q/unheard_of_rains_861388_2013_a_few_samples/).

And here is just the last *7 Days*: 

[Months of Rain Flood Burlington in mere hours](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cw4gi/flash_flood_months_of_rain_flood_burlington_in/)

[Mudslides: California Torrential Rain Storm was a nearly 500-year event, officials say](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cw3ai/mudslides_california_torrential_rain_storm_was_a/)

[100 Year Storm Hits Southern Idaho | Torrential Rain- Flooding](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cw1q5/100_year_storm_hits_southern_idaho_torrential/)

[Anger as floods hit hospital a year after 40m catastrophe - 40mm of rain fell in a 15-minute period.](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cw1q5/100_year_storm_hits_southern_idaho_torrential/)

[Heavy rains flood downtown Albuquerque](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2ciw14/heavy_rains_flood_downtown_albuquerque/)

[Floods in Kalyan; 1,500 evacuated | 8in. Rain in several hours.](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cav53/floods_in_kalyan_1500_evacuated_8in_rain_in/)

[One dead, homes evacuated after torrential rains in American Samoa](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cauh9/one_dead_homes_evacuated_after_torrential_rains/)

[India landslide triggered by heavy rain kills at least 30 - World](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2casl0/india_landslide_triggered_by_heavy_rain_kills_at/)

Seven Days; *Eight* extraordinary rain events worldwide. In my experience this is utterly unprecedented. One '500 year' rain event is striking enough in a year. The past 2 years we have had multiple 100 and 500 year rainfalls over just a matter of a month or two.

----------------------

Note from Kolby:

The anomalous movement of the Jet Stream continues to reflect the findings of Jennifer Francis (Rutgers) and her associates. 

In a nutshell: that warming in the Arctic is creating deeper meandering loops in the Jet Stream (Rossby Theory) and that this is *slowing* the Jet Stream, leading to 'stuck' highs and cut off lows. In other words, weather systems that would quickly pass or not be as intense are now intense and longer lasting. For example: two weeks of intense rain instead of an hour or a day. These deeper loops are also pulling in weather systems from deeper south or farther north.

Great little explanatory video: http://youtu.be/_nzwJg4Ebzo

In this case, it is superheated air being pulled up into the UK from Spain by a deep 'loop' in the Jet Stream.

"There are fears about violent winds, high waves and tides and torrential rain that we have never experienced before," Satoshi Ebihara, the Japanese weather agency's chief forecaster, told journalists at a Monday news conference.
