 I had a great dane when I was little and my Dad got rid of him. As soon as I had my own house, I took my first bonus and bought an Akita against my wife's wishes. Like your wife, they were inseparable until he died at 13. 




 My coworker sent flowers to the dental hygienist who was nice to him and got the same response 




 We don't always get it and I wonder if it's when we make it too strong and add water to it. That may allow the solids to have more liquid to saturate or suspend in as it cools 




 I almost saw it like the movie Rob Roy and his clan, but Bilbo wasn't really the clan leader as far as I remember. More like a direct member of the clan family, the Tooks.  




 Tolkien pretty much avoided any references to social divisions with the Hobbits in his books. Other than a mayor and sheriff, I can't remember any other references to government or social structure. How Bilbo even lived was pretty ambiguous. Other than Sam being a Gardener, the other hobbits were of unknown skill and vocation.  
As for their relationship, we see guys walking down the street holding hands or arms around each other and many people think gay. In other places it's not that unusual. I see it a lot in India. To them it is like women doing that in the US. It is not that unusual and doesn't draw certain conclusions.  
I also don't think the traveling companions saw Bilbo or Frodo as masters. They were more the reason they were on the adventure, than a master they were following. There was no indication in the book that Sam was protective of Frodo before he was given the task of protecting the ring bearer. I think they became best friends on their journey. I agree that Sam was likely the stronger of the 2, but we have no way of knowing what the effect would have been if Sam had to carry the ring as long as either Bilbo or Frodo did. I don't recall Sam showing any hesitation giving back the ring in the book, like they made it seem in the movie. 




 Tea has a lot more solids in it than filtered coffee. It's just the solids coming out as it cools down and the solution(water) cannot contain as much solid (tea particles) My wife drinks cappuccino and it has a lot of solids too and it does the same thing but much quicker.  
We also drink a lot of ice tea during the summer and put it in a glass jug. Some teas seem to cloud up more than others. It seems to have something to do with the natural strength and the amount of powder in the tea. Weaker teas that I have to steep longer or with more leaves, and tea bags or powdery teas like a breakfast tea seem to cloud faster for me.  
Aren't most Ceylon teas chopped leaves and not whole leaf? Almost like a good Darjeeling or Assam? 




 Check out our history in South American in general and Venezuela in specific and you will see why the US talking about human rights is taken with a grain of salt there.  
Our actions in South American over the last 100+ years make me doubt our vow to spread democracy and human rights throughout the world. We supported some of the most vicious dictators in the world in Central and South America as well as many other areas in the world. Perfect example: Saudi Arabia. Where are our actions against them to stop the beheadings, lashings, cutting off limbs, preventing women from having any rights at all, etc, etc.  
The issues between Venezuela and the US have little or nothing to do with their human rights and everything to do with their oil. 




 In Daytona Beach you are able to drive on the beach. One of my buddies was driving and we were all scoping some cute girls in their bikini's. Apparently the guys in the car in front of us were scoping the same girls and slowed way down. When we hit him our bumpers locked. Everyone except the 2 drivers were amused. 




 I had about 30% movement in my shoulder prior to surgery. I went to a therapist 3 times per week for 6 weeks. They also gave me a chair that passively manipulated my shoulder, which I used for 6 weeks as well.   
I've had both shoulders done and this Dr was not as involved in my therapy so it was a little slower going. It helped but not as much as when the Dr was involved after the first surgery. People I know who had a similar problem and did not have surgery or did not follow through on their therapy, are still suffering from severe lack of movement. 




 I go to Planet Fitness so I did 1/2 the leg machines on 1 day and the other 1/2 on the other day. Mostly top and bottom thigh and calf on one day and inside and outside thigh and stomach on the other day. Bike is my cool down so I always do that. I avoided all free weights until I was completely done with therapy. 




 All sorts of nations cleared out the natives when they moved in. Step back a bit further and see what the colonists did to the Caribbean natives.   
I have a good friend who's Armenian. They were also killed in large numbers by the Turks and they have never acknowledged what they did and still refuse to admit to genocide.  
I think it about the ability to make others aware that makes a difference.  How many newspapers or radio and tv stations are owned or were owned by the native Americans? Their voices were never heard.

 I had my labrum repaired last summer and I did the same thing. As long as I stretched my shoulder before, during and after, it was ok. I still have to be careful with working the upper body. 




 I did something similar, but I had a ring on and it shattered the glass in my hand. I am still getting slivers coming through my skin 30+ years later. 




 I have a BS in Computer Science. We have people on our team who do not have degrees though. For controller configuration it would probably be something like computer certifications, but for different hardware manufacturers. Allen Bradley is a good example of someone who does this type of work.  
I had 10 years of manufacturing plant experience before I got hired into my current company. I was brought in to do technical installations and configuration of the software, but they needed someone to train the end users so they asked if I would be willing to try it. I have been doing it ever since.  
Travel can be a pain in the bottom too. Most companies fly you out and in on weekends so you may only be home 1 day before you are leaving again. The working hours when you are out of the country can be monstrous too. 12 hour days is not unusual.  
I do not get to see much of the local tourist stuff, but I do get to meet and learn about the people who live there.  
A lot of people started on our team by coming up through the support center where they learned the applications and how to communicate with customers. Personally, I spent 10 years in sales working with the same industries I now do training for. At that time I was just a computer geek on the side. 




 Quite a while ago I read a similar story.  
A guy got a hand job when he was on a trip to China and when he got back to the states started having some problems. The first Dr. had no idea what it was. The 2nd Dr asked him if he got a hand job when he was in China. Turns out there is some virus and he was told they had to amputate. The 3rd and 4th Dr's said the same thing.  
He went back to China to get another opinion from a Dr with experience in his problem and was told; "In the US they always want to cut stuff off. If you wait a couple more weeks it will fall off on its own."
 




 sorry, sw=software.  
There are lots of applications that are used all over the world. I work with industrial applications mostly. There's also lots of work on the configuration side. Those jobs are usually extended stays; 3 months to a year. They need people to configure the robots and other automated systems. They usually work for the automation companies. Training requires less specific knowledge and a lot more general knowledge.  
I have anywhere from 5 to 50 people in my classes or I could be directly on the floor of the plant working with individual users. My trips last for as little as one day for regional manufacturing sites or up to 2 weeks for international sites. 




 Examples to support this?  
My guess what you are seeing is countries like China and the USSR were more concerned with everyone having a job. In capitalist countries it is all about profit and productivity. The owner will fire you if they think they can make more profit without you. 




 Tai Chi would fill a lot of your requirements and offer a lot of other benefits 




 Thank you very much for the link. I will try to find at least the 1st one when I am there. I brought about 1/2 a kilo home with me from Taiwan when I was there in October. I expect to do the same thing in Vietnam. 




 Thanks. My favorite teas come from Yunnan, China. Vietnam shares the same mountain range there and the tea can be very simiar. I am looking forward to trying a nice variety of Vietnamese teas while I am there. 




 That is the story. Thanks for sharing. :-) 




 I train sw applications around the world. I joined the military when I was 20 to see the world. That didn't work out so well because I got jacked around with the contract I had and the school I was guaranteed. Seeing it as a corporate trainer is even better because I travel first class most places and stay in 4 star hotels.  
There is lots of travel involved, but that is a bonus as well. 




 Fat? He didn't look fat to me. He was a big guy though like he once could have played football as something like a linebacker. He made enough to eat and fill his basic needs.  
Public transportation in Detroit sucks and there are no jobs in Detroit. He could not afford a vehicle but he was motivated enough to do what he had to to put money on the table. He has done this for well over a decade.  
And as for the money he got through crowdfunding was because people liked that he worked so hard when so many are willing to sit back and take. They chose to give him 5 or 10 bucks to help him get on his feet. They felt the effort he has put into keeping his job showed that given the chance, he would make good decisions.  
And here is something else for you to chew on; a dealership gave him a car too. 




 There was someone who named their daughter La-A and got upset with the teacher who called her Laa. The mother said, don't you see the dash, it's La dash A. Face palm

 It's been a while, but here are the rolls imo:  
Rogue: sneak roll  
Victim: perception roll  
Rogue: I assume the other hand is using victims throat to control their head so there is a roll to choke  
Victim: reaction roll  
Rogue: -2 on attack to get knife in position  
Victim: reaction  
Act plays out 
Both: reaction roll   
Rogue: +2 to attack, +4 to crit Also -4 to defense during encounter due to both hands being used. 




 I'll be in the old French quarter in Hanoi for a week on business with a Sunday to explore.I'd like to find some nice teas if possible. Are there tea stores like in Taiwan? Also, any suggestions for things to do or be aware of? Thanks 




 When I was in Taiwan the tea store made a 12 year old pu-erh. His method was to boil the tea for about 5 minutes and then put it in the gai wan and pour fresh hot water over it and steep as you said. He said he did that to wake the tea up. 




 With the cups, it was noticeable in the store. The gai wan did not show its crackling until it had been used a few times. Customs opened it and when they put it back together, they didn't secure it so it got a little chip too. I'm heading back in a month and may get another one. The cups were cheap, like 3 US. The gai wan was about 50 US. It's made from a nice clay. 




 A local tea shop has 3 grades of it and I actually like the medium grade more than the top. It's $6 for 50 grams. The top grade one is $9 per 50g, bottom is $4.50 per 50g. 




 Like others have said, I like to switch things up. I love Yunnan black teas. They age like red wine but they are so good fresh, it makes them hard to save for later.  On the other hand a really nice Oriental Beauty oolong from Taiwan is tough to beat. I recently fell in love with old tree black tea from Taiwan. A lot of the black tea harvested in Taiwan is a strain developed when the Japanese controlled the island in WWII. It is a lot more like an Assam tea. The tea from the original tree plants is a bit more rare. I found it incredibly flowery like an oolong but more hearty like a black tea.
My favorite though - TWG Yunnan Gold Needle. It's too expensive to make it a regular tea so it is always appreciated. 




 Here is a gai wan and one of the teacups I bought while I was in Taiwan. It's hard to notice the crackling in the glaze in the picture but it really stands out nicely on both the cups and gai wan.

 http://www.yunnansourcing.us/store/index.php?id_product=461 controller=product Traditional Process Dian Hong Black tea of Feng Qing  It's a really nice fresh tasting tea that compliments the little honey I put in my tea. One of the things I like about Dian Hong's is even if you over brew them, they do not get bitter or overly tannic. They also have a nice malty, slightly smokey taste with lots of floral notes. 




 No, but I will be in Taiwan again at the end of the month and I am looking forward to trying some new teas again. I did just order 7 strains from your Chinese site. They have the 2015 spring teas in. I think one of my problems with trying to find the flavors from T2Tea or TWG is I am trying to hit a moving target. By that I mean that since Yunnan black teas age so nice, I am likely getting much older leaves than I do when I order from you because as multi location retail stores, I am sure they are buying in bulk and sell what they have before they place a new order. For all I know the T2Tea Grand Yunnan that I fell in love with was from a 2007 crop or something and they had it sitting on their shelves and in their warehouse for 2 years. I do absolutely love the freshness of the teas I get from you. I cannot touch your tea quality in any retail store in the area. 




 If you like the Bond movies at all I'd recommend Peter O'Donnell's Modesty Blaise books. He has 13 books and years of comics. The books are excellent because you get a lot more substance, but his stories are very good whether in comic or book form. The books have 2 main characters; Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin. They are ex criminals who now help the Brit's intelligence service. The bad guys are even better than Bond's bad guys. 




 Have you tried any Jo Nesbo? His books deal with serial killers and a cop who chases them. I've found his books to be very well written and his stories are tight. 




 Anything by Pratchett or even Vonnegut. I am a sucker for good satire and they are both excellent satirists. 




 **From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler** is an excellent book for boys and girls around that age. 




 These are for light reading, but the Modesty Blaise books are excellent. They are similar to Fleming's Bond books, but I find O'Donnell's stories a bit more interesting and realistic. And Modesty is a far more interesting character than James Bond. 




 Kafka's The Castle as an example of the futility of life.
Howard Zinn's A People's History of the US as an example of how the little people get stepped on.
Huxley's Brave New World or Orwell's 1984 to show the future and change the framework we view some of society's actions through.
Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment as an example of how we distort our world both to the positive and negative, and it is just a downright depressing book. 




 Also, I use a gaiwan about 20% of the time but typically just use a strainer and place that in a travel cup for 1.5-3 min depending on the tea. 




 70% of the tea I drink is from Yunnan, about 20-25% is from Taiwan and the remaining 5-10% is from India. I get my Yunnan teas from Yunnan Sourcing (Both the US and Chinese sites) and my Taiwanese teas from Dragon Tea House. I still need to try some of their Yunnan's to see how they compare. The 2 best Yunnan's I have had were Grand Yunnan from T2Tea in Australia and TWG's Golden Needle. They both have a scent and flavor I have not found elsewhere. They are both expensive teas to get delivered to the states.
Thanks for sharing the info. I will try to look at the video later. 




 1984 2400 baud modems. Lots of BBS and finding information was harder than finding some subreddits. There was also a lot of sketchy stuff going on. In some ways, it was a lot easier to find the sketchy info on the web than it is now. There was a site called Long John or Pirate something that had all sorts of info on making drugs, explosives, scams to pull, ways to hide from the system, etc. Back then no one thought, who is watching me do this. Now that would be my first thought. 




 I was wondering the same thing. When I switched from Prince of Wales bag to loose, the change was significant. I liked the change, but I had to brew it different. Less tea and less time brewing was what worked for me. 




 10-20sec infusion? Maybe for English Breakfast tea but oolongs and most other teas need more time and even most people who drink breakfast teas want the bite you get from a decent brew time. I just carry a plastic cup to put my strainer in. Even a ziplock works in a pinch. 




 I have bought some tea online that also had a sea water flavor. I didn't drink it after the first try. I assume it had been waterlogged somewhere along the line. You could try different brew methods, gaiwan, strainer, pouring over leaves, putting leaves in hot water, etc. I found tea tastes a lot different depending on how you brew it. 




 Yes I have. I really enjoy that tea. It reminds me of the wild black tea from Taiwan. 




 I think you're right. I was in Taiwan recently and it seemed like it was mostly small farm products that were sold in just one or two stores. I can't find any of them online. 
Feng Qing is a county in Yunnan province. I've tried a few of those and they are nice. I do not know what Jin Ya is. I think Dian Hong is just the bud and top leaf or 2 leaves. 




 a fairly hot milf is my guess 




 I had the same problem. Lent out my original, got a different translation and wondered how I could have liked it. It did not flow at all and it was a chore to read. I found the Penguin translation again and loved it again.
I think it is challenging to maintain the flow or poetry of a book when it is translated. I can't even imagine how challenging it is with poetry where the number of syllables is maybe more important than it is in other literature. 




 vegetarian chili. But make a lot because everyone will eat it. I use 7 beans, red,green and yellow peppers. a couple of habanero's a couple jalapenos and 1 hot cherry pepper. I use both fresh tomatoes and canned and some paste to thicken it up. 




 My son started out with sauces and worked to perfect a couple at a time. He then started to learn Indian flavor profiles. Unfortunately his girlfriend is getting all the benefits of his skills now. It was like having a 4 star chef in the house. He was very good at building flavors. 




 Dosadi experiment by Frank Herbert. It's a much better first book to get into Frank Herbert than Dune imo. It should be easy to find used. 




 There are so many variables. Some strains, especially pure indica's, are known for couch lock. If someone cuts their plants down too late, the chemicals change and you get more of the one that makes you relaxed or tired too.  There are strains in the dispensaries around here that people call house cleaning bud because you cannot sit around really when you smoke it. It really lights a fire under you. But like all strains, the names mean little. The strain I am talking about is Bubba Kush but not all of them do that. Maybe because of crappy growing, genes or even cutting it down too late. 




 The names we get for Dian Hong's are funny. Yunnan Gold Needle, Grand Yunnan, Yunnan gold tips and now I see your White gold. It looks like a nice dian hong though. 




 I love your teas. I am still searching for a replacement for T2Tea's Grand Yunnan, but I am enjoying trying your Yunnan varieties. Some of them are very close to the taste of the Grand Yunnan. So far I have tried about 10 varieties of your Dian Hong's and the Red Alio (I may be getting the spelling wrong) is incredible. 
























 Do you ever have tea in a Chinese restaurant?  If you like that, it is typically an oolong.  If you like coffee, I'd recommend an Assam or even a breakfast tea.  If a friend wanted to get into teas, I'd start with oolongs and jasmine greens as they are the most taste friendly for starting.  
There are lots of decent black teas out there. Harny and Sons has some decent ones, Twinings is a UK standard and is pretty good too. I love their Prince of Wales tea. It is strong but still has nice subtle notes. And their Irish and English breakfast teas are very nice. Strong, but tasty. And try a decent darjeeling if you get a chance too. They are very unusual teas with a lot of subtle flavors. 




 To me it looks metallic. I think either you are not using filtered water and you are seeing the sediment like you do in an iron, or there is metal in the clay and it is showing up now.  




 I don't understand the foofy strainers. Strainers have one function, to give you a nice cupa. A product that forgets that main goal and worries more about style is not for me.  It looks nice though. 




 On the other hand, the Great Lake Alliance may be the strongest alliance. We'd even let Lake Champlain call themselves a great lake then. 




 He has the firecrackers to get through the blow stuff up phase, moving to the sending stuff up to blow up, and soon graduating to combining firecrackers and bottle rockets to blow stuff up in the air, just because. 




 There are so many things wrong with this picture. 




 I recently bought 3 teas from Dragon Tea House.  I ended up giving the other 2 Yunnan's away and I've had mixed feelings about their Wild leaf tea.  It is incredibly mild, almost to the point of no taste. I filled my strainer about 1/3 of the way with tea, and put it in freshly boiled water. Has anyone had better luck with their company? 




 TWG has some of the nicest high end teas I have ever seen.  But you can spend over 700US for 50g of some of their tea.  I also use Yunnan Sourcing and have found their teas to be way above average. I am waiting on a delivery of their spring teas. 




 Most Chinese restaurants I go to server Oolong.  You could even ask at the restaurants if they sell their tea.  Most places I go to will sell boxes to customers.  The great thing is, most restaurants do not use high quality tea so you should have a lot of growth potential in your tea tastes.  Every brew method will give you a different taste. 




 When I get to work I make a travel mug (16oz) of black tea. Typically a Dian Hong, although I bring my Taiwanese black teas in to mix things up sometimes.  If I make a 2nd cup, I typically use the leaves over and just pour the hot water over the leaves instead of filling the cup and putting the strainer in after.  




 T2Tea's Grand Yunnan. I bought 50g in their shop when I was working in Melbourne. Before I left I bought 100g more because it was the most amazing tea I had ever tried.  
After that, my wife or kids would order some for a Christmas present. I think my last order was a crop from a new year and the taste was significantly more mild. I ran out of the last bag of that about 1 month ago.  
TWG's best Dian Hong is very close if not better than T2Tea's Grand Yunnan, but I just happened upon it going through Singapore airport and I only got 50g 




 Sorry, I should have been more specific too. Any Black/Red Yunnan teas.They have some teas that look very interesting but I am worried they will be like Origins Tea and be fairly mediocre. Any input would be appreciated. 




 I guess I should mention, I am not, nor ever have been, involved in unions in any way. I am a systems analyst for industrial software applications. I have also never taken any money from the gov in unemployment or disability, nor has my wife, nor have my kids. I work with both management and union workers in my job. I have spent the last 5 years launching new software around the world. My job does not leave me much time to do touristy things, but I do get to meet the people and have lots of time to talk to them about their country. It is something I am very interested in when I travel. For the most part I am very non political when I am out of the country and I avoid arguments regardless of how strong I feel about a topic.  
I am there professionally to teach them new software, but I am there personally to learn about them and their country. 




 I see your agreements, but you seem to disregard how those policies manifest themselves. It manifests itself quite clearly in those countries.  
Linking to possibly the closest we have in the US to the National Enquirer, Murdoch's Daily Mail and next to The Economist as the most corporate/free market magazine; Forbes, tells me where you validate your opinions and why your opinions are what they are.  
Have you actually been to any of the BRIC countries? Everyone I worked with wanted out. The most common question I get is; how do I get a job with corporate in the US? There is no safety. Your life and your families lives are at constant risk.  
Through the 70's, S and C America, Africa and the islands of the Caribbean and far east were pretty much places the powerful countries put their people in power and sucked the nations dry. Corporations with their nations blessing and often assistance or Russian autocratic communists, would put a leader in power and get long term sweet heart deals on their resources. Effectively preventing that country from ever using their resources for the benefit of their people beyond the pay they got for removing them or harvesting the products. Examine Chiquita's or United Fruit's history in South and Central America to see what I am talking about. Read up on Baby Doc Duvalier's history in Haiti to see the kind of people we put in power. Take any critical resource we get from 3rd world countries and read the history. The western nations and the USSR had no regard for the people in the countries with the resources they wanted.  
Are the neo liberal policies better than dictatorships? Sure. I agree. Is that the best option? Not by any means.   
   
I'd recommend reading Howard Zinn's: A People's History of the United States.  That is what is playing out in the BRIC countries right now. I'd also recommend looking at how Norway has handled their natural resources and used those resources to benefit everyone in their country.  Income disparity in Norway is no where near where it is in other countries because of who owns their natural resources and the benefits the people of the nation get from those resources. The pay difference between top management and the workers is far less than it is in other countries as well. We are one of the top oil producing nations and we only got 2.5 billion in royalties in 2012 from all oil and gas royalties. We give them more subsidies than they gave in royalties. If we treated our resources like Norway does, we would be far better off as a nation.   
The pay gap between the top and bottom in US corporations has gone up by over 300% in the last 30 years. That is the framework that is getting pushed by the IMF and the World Bank. More for the top and far less for the bottom. And it's why graduates can't find jobs in the US. It's all going ot the top.  
As you may have noticed from all the downvotes I am getting for my views, most people agree with your viewpoint. So it appears there is little to worry about as my views are seen as fringe anyway. I've had too many classes in analytic reasoning, logic, and the media to be swayed by all the emotion based distortions we see in the mainstream, corporate owned media and even in media with opinions I support. Everyone distorts and everyone is really presenting opinions. It's just a matter of knowing how your media distorts information and what opinions they are interested in expressing.  
And last, capitalism is a wide net and includes the European socialist systems.  I doubt if many people feel that capitalism is bad. I just feel that it needs to keep it's eye on the health of the community and less on industries leaders and their backers getting extreme profits. I also see countries like Norway who follow that path have less social problems and more social equality. Unbalanced social systems become more autocratic and then fall. 




 In our area, they're in expensive malls which forces them to overprice their tea.  Their selection's also mediocre, other than flavored teas. They may make amazing flavored teas, but that is not my cup of tea. 




 I'm not sure 




 He said it would powder the entire kitchen and the cost and time to clean up would be substantial.

 Wow, I had no idea you could upload without a UID. You could try sending a note to the team, but for user submitted it will be 20 pages down in under an hour so not many people will see it. Well other than posting here so people going and trying to find what you are referencing.  I wish I could help. 




 Top 1% in state, top 5% in nation. Because of bad grades in HS, it actually hurt me. They would rather have people that try hard, than people who skate by on their brains.

 Being shown the Ansul system when I started and told if there is a fire to pull this lever. I was then told I would be fired if I ever pulled the lever. 




 Finding new teas is one of the joys of being a tea nut. I'm glad you found oolongs.  You'll be amazed by the diversity there is in oolongs too. 




 Did the kool aid taste good at least? 




 If you are just calling to threat, it's like they can sense it. You have to be willing to follow through. Most of the time it was the actual person cancelling my service who lowered our rate to keep us on. Because you know, the person you get when you make the selection to cancel the service, can't actually cancel it. They want to send you through the team to see if they can change your mind, why you're doing it, etc. 




 Thanks. The Brits called it black tea because of the color of the dried leaf. Chinese call it red tea because that is the color of the brew.  The Chinese I work with kept calling my tea red tea and even pointed to writing on the label of my tea that said Red Tea in Chinese but black tea in English. 




 I used to call about once a year to cancel because a competitor's rates matched the rate comcast gives new customers. They folded for years (or I guess in their eyes, kept me as a customer)before they actually refused and let me cancel 




 As someone with a background in economics you also know there are a lot of theories. Libertarians think they have all the answers. There are many economists who disagree with them and state the facts far better than I can.  
Free trade agreements have cost us jobs. There are things more important than profit. What I have found in my travels is democratic countries with the strongest social protections have the largest middle class.  
Russia? Really?  
Brazil? They have police with machine guns at the cash machine in the manufacturing plant of a huge company because gangs break in and rip out the machines on pay day. I'm a 5 minute ride into the site to get to the building I was working in. The smoking area was near the cash machines and it was very discerning. Kidnappings are common, and the streets are not really safe to walk on.  
India has a nice growing middle class, but the poverty is something you never forget.  
But, yes, anyone can go to a store and buy an iPhone or the latest Samsung tv. You can also starve on the side of the street.  I actually love both Brazil and India. They certainly are not the US, but the people are pretty nice and the food is great in both places. 




 I'm not sure what this is, but it sure looks like an amazing Yunnan.

 The owner of a tea shop in Taiwan roasted a nice oolong and had me taste the roasted rolled leaf. It was amazing. I would munch on those all day. Talk about an expensive munchie though. 




 We weren't belligerent about it. Our kids were close friends and they pretty much gave everyone a bunch of BS about it and would never give straight answers. 




 It's not about smarts, it's about being informed, and most of the information out there is meant to distort and distract.   
An example in my own community; our neighborhood elementary school was always top 5% in the state. We also had 99% PTA membership in the school.  The city wanted to switch the school to a Jr. High but they knew the community would not agree. So working among themselves and the planning commission, they had a millage to do needed repairs to the school and bring it up to date with computers and the associated wiring. We had always supported school millage's so they were confident it would pass and it did.  
Then they told us after more analysis they were making the school a Jr. High instead and most of the money would be used to update all the bathrooms for older students. We did not pass the next 3 millages in our community. We knew the people on the planning committee and they all swore secrecy about the plan. They knew if it got out, they would all be thrown out of office. This gave them all another term. We are no longer friends with the 2 we knew. 




 I actually did not read the article. Hillary's views on trade deals have been pretty consistent. I also know the bias from the Hill site. I just know Hillary is no populist. She did not get where she is by supporting the little guys. When big biz gives her money, they get a worthwhile return on their investment. Like they do with most of them.  




 I understand. As much as I love my tea from T2Tea in Australia, that shipping stops me from ordering from them 90+% of the time. 




 Most people get their news from major corporations who do not have a populist view. Their view is that any leader who doesn't allow for a global free market in their country is bad, and they present that view to their readers over and over. It's hard to fault people for being ignorant when that is what their leaders want. 




 Yeah, at least in our country if a community is active in their political system, the system works pretty well.  
The problem is getting people off the TV and things like StumbleUpon, Imgur and reddit. ;-p 




 When I have been in S. America people talk about their corrupt gov. When I tell them it is pretty much the same in the US they are surprised. 




 I get tea from both China and Australia. It's almost 20US to ship from Australia but only 7 or 8 from China. I guess the queen has to get her cut. ;-p   
But, are you hoping to provide free shipping, or just worried the cost of shipping from Canada may be cost prohibitive to some? 




 You can get boxes for as little as 28 cents each here, so boxes really shouldn't be that much of a deal breaker, price wise.

I don't worry about tracking. I just make a small order the first time to see how the company handles things. 




 OK, police actions with our military, to satisfy your semantics. Boots on the ground are boots on the ground. Ask some people who were in Cambodia to see if actually being at war with the country in the official sense matters. 




 Same with bringing back a US backed stooge to run your country.  However, the people who now have clean water and access to healthcare sure do seem to think their lives are better off.  I compare it to Cuba. Before Fidel, the rich controlled 90% of the wealth in the country. The poor had little access to education or healthcare. The rich are pissed because the control and wealth they used to have, they don't have anymore. The fact that 90% have more is irrelevant to them.  The 1% wants it all. 




 She looked like the photo on the left in BJ's Diary. 




 So I see. I am an old fart who watches more B W movies than anything released in the last 20 years. My wife and daughter were watching BJ's Diary and I found it a fun light movie. That was my exposure to her. 




 Alpha males are pigs. Unfortunately most women look for alpha males.

 So do I compared to my pictures from 15 years ago. People that are heavy and change weight change even more. I'm pretty much my same weight from college but my friends who have gained or lost weight look so different.  I don't think she has had surgery, but I do not follow that crap too closely. 




 She's not a youngster anymore. She reminds me of Jennifer Lawrence because she seems like she is pretty without all the Hollywood dressings and comes across as less movie starish. 




 I never have enough of a layover in Dubai to get into the city. In Singapore's airport, they have a TWG shop. I had never heard of them before but the gold Yunnan I like so much looked incredible so I bought 50 grams. I think I paid 38 US for 50g.  It's the most expensive tea I have bought and it was good enough I would buy it again. For special occasions. :-) 




 Thanks. I will be in Taoyuan City and will visit the 2 tea shops I found near the hotel I was staying in. Hopefully I will be able to find a couple oolongs and nice black teas like I did in October of last year. 




 I think WMF's tea strainer is perfect. One of the problems I have with putting my tea directly in my cup is the fact that it continues to steep and often gets bitter.
As a new loose leaf drinker, I would recommend trying several different oolongs from Taiwan and China. I have found a relatively inexpensive oolong that I like as much as much higher priced ones. It's just a nice midgrade Tie Guan Yin. For a special treat, try Oriental Beauty from Taiwan. 




 I'm surprised no one has mentioned filtered water. I think the difference between regular tap water and filtered water is night and day.  
I try to switch up each week or every other week so the flavor of Yunnan teas do not get washed away. I find if I exclusively drink them, I do not get the same flavor after a while.  Typically I bounce between black tea from Taiwan or black teas from Yunnan.  
My routine is; as soon as I get into work I heat water in my teapot, add a bit of honey to the cup, pour the hot water into the travel mug I use and decide which of the 3 or 4 teas I keep at work to drink. I place the tea in my strainer and steep anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes depending on what I am wrapped up in. That will usually get me through the work day. When I get home I typically make an oolong or a mild Yunnan and follow the same steps. I use a gaiwan if friends are over and want to share some tea.  
I just ordered 7 new spring teas from Yunnan Sourcing so there will be a tea tasting going on in about 2 weeks that I am looking forward to. 




 That is a bummer. I am heading there in about 3 weeks and was looking forward to getting some more nice oolongs and their incredible old tree black teas. I actually chose to be routed through Taiwan for that reason. Arghh 




 TWG out of Singapore and T2Tea in Australia both have incredible teas. They are expensive though and shipping is not cheap either.  
Yunnan Sourcing offers the best Chinese tea I have found online, for a reasonable price. Yunnan teas have been my favorite for a while and I just found Yunnan Sourcing about a year ago. I've tried about 20 of their teas and haven't found anything I did not like and some I loved. I've also tried about 5 other Chinese tea sites and have given each of those teas away to less particular friends. 




 The owner of the tea store in Taiwan told me the same thing when I bought my gaiwan.   




 What compensation was given to the people who lived on that land? Taking more land and the water is not compensation. 




 I think the delicacy of a nice golden Yunnan is hard to beat. I use Yunnan Sourcing for my tea. I get most of it from their Chinese site. TWG's Golden Needle Yunnan is incredible.
