 Actually that's not true, it only affects your bone color.

 Hawaii and Arizona do not follow daylight-savings time because they recognize that it is a fraud, and a clear and present danger to the spacetime continuum.

When a program shows at 8:00pm Mountain Time during DST, the conflicting signals cause electrical arcs to surge from the ground in Arizona an hour into the future, killing anyone not wearing crocs or rain boots.  This is much like Tesla's experiments with pulling power out of the vacuum using a wet paper bag and a magnetron.  It was far too dangerous and the program was pulled.

 I usually stop thinking about it when I recall that.. he took a beating to get to where he was on more than one occasion, which means he's more dedicated to the experiment of government than I am.

At that point, I can't really knock him - even if I think whatever he's working on might be blas. 




 I think that the parliamentary style should apply:

"NO CONFIDENCE"

That's where I'm really at, to be frank. 




 I was getting ready for work and watched about half, listened to the other half.  Stuff like that gets me thinking in the morning before I have to go think for someone else on the clock [whoops, I'm not doing that right now..] 




 It did allow me to read up on Presidential Candidates, but then had no coverage of John Lewis' positions on major subjects for the congressional seat race, which is then further confusing. 




 It's a sample ballot provided by the AJC, ostensibly meant to allow you to COMPARE candidates.  Doesn't really work if there's just an incumbent.
