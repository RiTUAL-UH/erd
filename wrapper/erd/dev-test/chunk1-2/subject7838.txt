 The flashback to the Trojan war sort of shows his beginnings 




 Bottom part is the Aeneid and the Odyssey, great classics 




 Wowsers.  Here's my own story chart in progress http://i.imgur.com/pOG1NNi.jpg 




 "I'm Always so on top of my game"

Haha 




 Notice how Matthew's character is afraid of time and the spaceship on the poster is like a watch/clock as it is a circle split up into 12 sections 




 Just realized that the ship has 12 different sections, not unlike the face of a watch 




 Thanks.  I'll give it a try soon 




 I'm playing through night 6 of FNAF 1 now and it's a lot of fun.  I like watching videos of people playing FNAF 2 but it doesn't look as cool and looks unnecessarily complicated.  Does anyone else feel the same way?  Or should I change my mind and give it a try? 














 I saw it at TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood.  They started the film and it was playing upside down.  Took them 15 minutes to fix it 





























 For example, some horror movies have been ranked by which produced the highest heart rate (The Shining increases bpm by 28%) and some comedies are measured in "laughs per minute" (Airplane has 3 laughs per minute). 




 That movie is #8 top grossing all time (adjusted for inflation) and yet it's not on very many "top 100" lists at all. 




 Hooray 




 Surely you can't be serious 




 6th grade for me 




 The Lady Vanishes!  It's Hitchcock but no one ever seems to mention it.  I enjoyed it more than The 39 Steps. 




 What happened to Dr. Zhivago...?  Deleted comment, oops.  I liked that one more than Lawrence of Arabia 




 What we have here is a failure to communicate. 




 How are you so good at gardening?  It sure beets me 














 The Lady Vanishes 1938.  Proves that you don't need Hans Zimmer to get your mind blown. 









 I meant 2011 to 2014, sorry.  The Lego Movie is top-ranked so far this year.

Warner Brothers acquired Rotten Tomatoes in 2011, so those are the years in question.

 Yeah I know where you mean.  They have video cameras there?  I've never heard of any parks literally stopping a ride because of video cameras. 




 That's the bottom of the first drop... There ain't no brakes there 


































 The scariest monsters are the ones you don't see...

Some students and I made "The Haunting":

 Brilliant 




 Time to face the facts 




 Frazbear's Freight... look out for the Freddy train! 




 You've got me beat, dangit 




 School film contest 




 Noope 




 Nope 




 There's a link to merchandise on the right side of your page under "The Community" 




 It's Mr. Potato Head, Iron Man version, a.k.a Tony Starch 




 Play it on mobile and don't use headphones, it's less scary 




 That's a good point.  Do we know if anyone is possessing the suit? 




 Freddy Fazbear's Pizza does birthdays!  Reserve the party room! 




 I think "Freddy's: The Ride" would be awesome 









 wut 




 Yeah, Jaws also comes to mind as a good example.  Or some scenes in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. 




 I would be super tempted to eat it

And then you would have to send me another 




 It is about murderous animatronics but one of the reasons why it's so successful is no blood or violence is explicitly presented.   

In this article he talks about trying to keep it "relatively clean with no blood or guts" http://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/developer-spotlight-scott-cawthon/

This reserved approach to horror is rarely seen but super effective, I mean the only comparison I could think of is Alfred Hitchcock (who was Catholic) who made thrillers like Psycho and the Birds 




 What happened to just calling him Golden Bonny? 




 School in LA 




 I never noticed Bonny in/on the arcade machine before 









 Nobody is from California? 




 Here's my story chart http://i.imgur.com/pOG1NNi.jpg 














 What if the character can't go through the vents unless you forget to keep the ventilation systems online? 




 Well here it is in another song 20 years older https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEibygqqLZc 




 Best thing I've seen all day 




 The chord is a sample from "I Love You More" by George Duke 




 I'm a big fan (no, not like the one on the desk) and I've beat night 6 in both games.  However, none of my friends want to play it; they are either too scared or don't understand the concept.  How do you share this game with people?  What are your experiences with this? 




 Just beat it yesterday!  You can do it, the custom nights are worth it.  Wind up the box 4 twists at a time and shine the light for Foxy, those are the tips that helped me finish it 




 Why not just draw one card and use the color on that one to dictate 1-10 vs 11-20?  So you'd only need 4 cards 




 The cameras are definitely going to be in the game. 




 Yeah I did but the way you said that makes me think I didn't 




 Yeah but I don't use it very often 














 Love that new pain job 




 I'd like to think this is what the peeps are thinking in Roller Coaster Tycoon or Sim City 




 Gosh darn it 




 Three entrances, sorry. 




 Just noticed that in FNAF 1, there are 2 doors in your office.  In FNAF 2, there are 3 doors.  In FNAF 3, there is only one apparent door.  Chronologically, Scott is counting down 3, 2, 1... 
























 Made it myself, took me forever to figure out how to make a gif out of it
