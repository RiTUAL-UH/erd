 There is post offering a bitcoins and I am dumbfounded. Some think it's good  and some think it's more of an insult to give a starving family 26 cents.

I do not want this subreddit to be a place where  responses to real problems are answered in pennies. But I admit I am totally ignorant to all of this.

What do all think about this? Please help me. I am clueless to all of this. Does this really offer any real assistance or is it just an insult to those in need? I know every penny counts but we are interested in real solutions, not making people beg for scraps. 

It may be a solution to a small sector of people who are into this but is it really something for the /r/assistance community?

Please give me your opinions and advice.  














 After the McDaniel loss last night, I hear all this talk about how pissed the Tea Party is and how they want to split from the party. But as an outside observer,  I'm find myself confused and really can not tell the difference between the two. They have voted the same in all congressional votes. Basically no no and no and yes on Obamcare repeal.

I mean what is really the difference between the two. I just don't see it. One may talk crazier than the other but they both vote for the exact same things.

What is the actual  difference when it comes to how each of them vote or what they stand for?

 



















 I mean your really honest and candid comments. 









 I can't justify paying $16 a month just for these two shows. Is there another way I can still see them. Doesn't matter if it's later in the week than they appear.

I have never done streaming before.

 I just changed my browser to Chrome and now when I click a link to an image here on reddit the picture is huge. I have to shrink it manually to see what it is.

It's obvious one of my settings somewhere is doing this. Can you tell me what setting I need to change to make these pictures appear a normal size without having to shrink it manually each time? 



















 I have a good friend who is losing his sight. I'm looking to get information about devices that will allow him to still use his computer. Any suggestions on which subreddit to post in? 



















 They seem to have made anything and everything Obama does some sort of act of Satan. To me the question is not if they will, but how they will. 

How long do you think people are going to continue and fall for this obvious smear campaign?

As of now there hasn't been anything. But I'll bet you I can come here two days from now and that will not be the case.

 I want to send out some personal thank yous to folks that contriibuted to the Baes fund raiser. There was a link to click on the first donation that allowed me to do that. Now I can't seem to find it anymore. There are a couple of people I want to thank. How do I do that?

 When I put the key in my 2002 Doge Neon, it just spins and does not lock or unlock the car. I looked at videos online and took off the door panel. The cables going to the lock work perfectly. It's the actual part where you put the key in that isn't working.

I want to get it fixed but fear if I go to the dealer they will way over charge me for a simple job.

How would you smart guys here approach this problem. Or should I say how do you recommend someone like me approach it so I don't get over-charged hundreds of dollars for a simple problem?

 Now that the smoke is clearing, it's pretty evident that the sole issue Dave Brat ran on (immigration) was not much of a factor in this election. Virginians actually support immigration reform by a pretty decent margin. 

So could it be that the candidate that actually won was the "Not-Cantor" candidate? 





























 Being the head mod of r/assistance, I have made it a policy, to make or endorse a request for anyone to avoid any conflict of interest.  But I am making a rare exception because one of our own needs us in the worst way. /u/baes is one of the nicest people I've ever met on reddit.
 
Last year in r/SantasLittleHelpers, I met him and he loved what we were doing and joined in to help in every way he could, even though he was undergoing chemotherapy for the cancer that invaded his life. 

We loved him so much, we made him a moderator in r/assistance and he instantly fit in, continuing the wonderful work he had done during Christmas. But his condition has deteriorated to the point he can barley see the screen anymore. We keep in touch because his wife reads my messages and helps him compose the ones back to me. 

It really saddens me how such a good guy is having to go through so much. And to make it worse, he and his family now face considerable financial troubles. I could go into them but lets just say they need our help in the worst way.

 Trying figure out if someone deleted their account. Will their name still show up on their old posts and comments or will it say **"deleted"** under the part where it says who made the post or comment?

If they had been banned by the administrators, wouldn't their posts show up in light pink? I know the newer ones will but I'm not sure about the old ones.

 




 It seems like the gay marriage ban is being struck down in one state after another. There is now a pending case in every single state that has a gay marriage ban. Should this trend continue and it eventually goes to the Supreme Court, how do you think the nation would react if they nullified every decision made by federal judge after judge in  making it clear the ban is unconstitutional? Of course it would be the usual 5-4 decision.

 Currently a user can initiate a modmail thread that all mods see and can participate in. 

But a mod can only initiate a thread other mods can see. We don't have the ability to include another user in that conversation. 

My reasoning behind this is when we have issues with a user, the mod has to send a personal message to them that only he and the user  see. It would be much more useful for all the mods to see and participate in it. That way all mods know what is going and can offer their input as well. 

It would really help keep the mod team on the same page and for the user to not be singled out by one mod.

I know it can be done. It is exactly what happens when you ban a user. A message is sent from whoever banned the user to the user and to modmail that all the mods and the user can see and participate in.

I think this would help both the mods and the user. Everyone wins.

Thank you considering it. :D 




 I want to ask the administrators to add a tool that would help us. Basically a way we can send a mod message to a user that would start a mod thread all the mods could see.

Just like when you ban a user, that thread appears under the mod that sent it, but all the mods can see it and participate in it.

This way when we have an issue we need to communicate to a user, all the mods will see it and can participate in it. Current we can only do that when the user initiates the thread.  




 When you ban a user, it starts a mod thread that all the mods can see and also the person you banned. You have a mod thread with the user and the mods.

Is there a way to initiate that type of thread from a mod so all the mods will be in on something when we send messages to a user?

 I run /r/assistance and currently it is allowing users to submit linked posts. It never used to allow that. It is important to us that only text posts be allowed.

I have the box checked under subreddit settings to **text posts only.**

Yet it still gives users the option to make a linked post. We've been text post only for a long time now. I don't know how or why it is behaving this way.

Any guesses?

Looks like timotab figured it out. It's only letting the mods do it. Thanks timotab! 









 I just want to know what I can site as reddit's readership. So about how many subscribers and maybe an estimate of their total readership. 




 I'm wondering if it's just me. I actually still have the little cog wheel button to change my settings, but all of the RES features have disappeared.

 I did this room addition last year for my brother's boss. It took several months and I developed a very special bond with their dog. I just heard they had to put him to sleep. I'm not super close to these folks but my brother told me his bosses' wife told him to make sure he let me know. I thought I would send something like flowers but I wasn't sure that would be appropriate. What do you think? Have any other ideas? 












































 I run /r/Assistance and I have a user that needs to communicate with someone right now because they are helping him with an urgent problem.

He made the post with a throwaway account but I have his other account too that he hasn't used for over a year. But now it says he has to wait five hours to sign in to either account. I've never heard of anything like this. Is there a reason they do this and is there anything I can do to help him get around this? 

















































 I've talked with so many other people and no one but U-Verse subscribers in Anaheim (Fullerton) are being deprived of the game. This is the first time in LA sports history that two local teams are meeting head-to-head in a playoff and the most devoted fans are the only ones who don't get to see it. 

And the only reason is we made the mistake of having U-Verse. ATT has really screwed us big time. I've called them and can't even get an explanation. They say it's because it's on a local channel which is a lie. It was during the regular season but not for the playoffs.

And it's not like there should be some contract dispute that doesn't allow it. DISH, Direct, Time Warner and everyone else but U-verse people get it.



-------------------------------

**EDIT:**

After spending two days on the phone being given every excuse in the world and finally being told it is just blacked for me, and there were no options for me to get it..., for some reason I am now getting it. I think I was more frustrated by them not being able to give me a valid reason and telling me lie after after lie. But I am watching the game right now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykpjFjsEdl4 









 The series of the year is being blacked out on my TV (Fullerton, CA) and ATT says it's because they have not negotiated a contract with NBCSN. I think they are BSing me because I still get the channel but it blacks out just during the Kings/Duck game. I near yo folks in Los Angeles are getting it but we in Orange County do not? That does not make sense.

My question to you out there in LA, are you getting the games? And what city do you live in? I am hassling with them right now and need to know whether or not I am going to quit my service.

 The Kings/Ducks hockey games have been blacked out for my area. (Orange County, California) - Not only that, they blacked out the end of the games before that so I wasted hours watching it only to have the last 30 minutes of the game blacked out. They are not blacking them out on Direct TV or Dish from what I hear. They are just being dick heads.

 

What in the heck is going on? This is ridiculous. This is the first time in history two LA sports teams are meeting each other in a playoff and we in the local area don't get to see it. Seriously I am really frustrated about this.

 I have ATT U-Verse and the game is supposed to be on NBCSN. But the channel is black right now. Are they actually blacking out a sold out game for us? If so, does anyone know where I can watch it on the computer? 




 Seriously, men go nuts and want to kick the shit out some guy messing around with his girlfriend. But more times than not, it is the girlfriend who is responsible for the cheating.

 I remember this song from long ago. When I google it all I get is a bunch of violent rap songs. This song is nothing like that. I think it's an acoustical guitar piece by a pretty famous artist from the 70s or 80s. And the song is not violent at all. 

The lyrics may be "turn on the news o see who's shooting who" or "tune in the news to see who's shooting who." 






















































 All of a sudden it takes a couple seconds for the keystrokes and mouse clicks to show up on the screen after I enter them.  I have done malware and virus scans. No help there. I have defragemented, and I still have all kinds of space left on my computer. It also doesn't register anything after I get six or seven characters ahead. So I have to type five ore six letters and then sit and wait for it to catch up. And even then some of the words I typed aren't there.

 The pipe broke and left the inch or so that inserts into the female part of the main sewer pipe. It's flush with the the female sleeve. Here is the generic photo of the connection:

http://cloudfront.zorotools.com/product/full/1CNT9_AS01.JPG

It is a 4" to 2"

I would like to fix this without having to replace the piece above. I just need to get that one or two inch piece out of that fitting so I can put a new pipe in there. Someone  told me to chip it out with a screwdriver but I am afraid I will break the female part in the process.

Another person said there might be some kind of drill bit that looks like a spade that I can use to drill it out. I have no idea what it is called or if it even exists.

At this point I'm not sure how to proceed. I was hoping for some suggestions on how to chip or drill it out with more ease and without breaking the female part of the fitting. Or any other methods you might have up your sleeve.


----------------------------

**EDIT**

Off the advice of a redditor, I used a rubber tee with a clamp and it fit over the female part of the coupling.

It looked like this:

I had given the wrong size in my post but was still able to find a fitting that worked. It ended up being the 2" opening off of a 3 X 2 tee. But all that matters is it worked. Once again washing clothes without flooding the underneath of my house.

Thank goodness for reddit. :D

 Title says it all - Please **VOTE!!!** 





























 I recently read this quote from our president:

 A few timid people who fear progress, will try to give you new and strange names for what we are doing. Sometimes they will call it fascism; sometimes communism; and sometimes socialism. 




 But in so doing, they are trying to make very complex, something that is really very simple, and very practical. 


--------------

And I read what they say about him:


* People everywhere are growing impatient.  On the right  organized by some of the most powerful industrialists charging that the presidents actions are only making things worse.

  That the president has become a dictator, defying the constitution, encouraging class warfare. Saying the president is hell-bent on socialism. There can only be one capital, they say; Washington or Moscow. There can only be one flag. The stars and stripes, or the flag of the godless Soviets. His enemies only referred to him as that man in the White House. Because they cannot bear to say his name. 

  On the left socialist and some communist took to the street denouncing the president as a captive of capitalism; incapable of bringing about real change.

---------------------

Hearing this makes me wonder what they will say about Obama in the history books in the years to come.

What are your thoughts about what they say now and do you believe he will be remembered differently or just like what the say now? I mean has any other president been so hated at the time, ever end up being considered a great president after all the smoke clears or is Obama stuck with the hatred forever? 



















 I have been negligent in sending out thanks for all the support and cards you have sent me and my 92 year old mom. She laughs and smiles when I bring her the cards. It has been rough but all of you have made things more bearable.

It's amazing how the support comes from every corner of the world. I just can not express my appreciation in this challenging time.

She is still in the care facility and her mental capacity has returned. But physically she is still extremely weak. We are hopeful that she will keep getting stronger and eventually may be able to bring her home.

Your support means everything to both me and her. 

Thank you. Thank you so much.

 The time has come and in this last crucial week /r/democrats will be dedicated solely to election issues and getting out the vote.

The only reason democrats lose in the midterms is because of voter turnout.

 We have one of your countrymen starving out there and we want to get this guy a pizza. I live in the US and could not find a way to order and pay for one.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2i7xwv/havent_eaten_since_monday/

I promise I will reimburse you. And I never break a promise.  














 I'm late at sending out thanks to you all. Mom got really sick and has been in the hospital this last week. Up until today it did not look good. Her mental state was gone. I was fearing the worst.

But today when I visited her, she was back. She was asking questions and  her mind was obviously back. I brought the cards you sent for her birthday that are still coming in and she loved them. From Germany, New Zealand, cities throughout the US, Australia and so many other places. She was reading them and smiling. Medicine that could not have come from anywhere else and it was working great.

Thank you all for keeping my mom happy and alive. Say some prayers that her recovery continues. Bless you all! :D

 Today I went to my sister's house for my mom's birthday. I kind of hate going to stuff like that because I always have to hear all that right-wing extremist crap. I mean they make FOX News look liberal. Especially my evil brother. The ignorance that comes out of his mouth is excruciating. I gave up long ago trying discuss anything with him.

So they are going on and on about the football player that beat his wife and the black guy that got killed in Ferguson and somehow made it about how unfair they were being to white people. How they got there I will never know. I was just biting my tongue but finally mentioned Zimmerman. The conversation went on without my participation but it was just so vile and ignorant. Talking about how unfair Zimmerman was treated and what a piece of shit the kid that got killed was. And how the black guy that got killed in Ferguson ruined that cops's life.
After several minutes of listening to this garbage, I finally just stood up and said:

"Yea..., those fucking niggers!"

Everyone just went silent and gasped. Even though for the last 20 minutes, that's what they had been basically saying. They thought it was horrible how I paraphrased it for them. They were not happy with me today. But I was giggling to myself how I actually out-extremed the extremists. 














 You may have noticed I have been pretty absent  here the last couple weeks. It's because I have the flu. And this thing just doesn't seem to want to go away.

Please by all that is holy - 

**GO GET YOUR FLU SHOT!!!**

This thing is the worst.

Here is a government site that will give you locations to get yours:

Please don't wait. This thing sucks. I'll see ya again soon when I get well. God forbid you get this damn thing. 




 Hearing that Scotland is voting to leave the UK is kind of surprising to some of us less UK-knowledgeable Americans. Could you give us the basics of who and what makes up the UK? 




 Some races are very close and upsets are very possible if we join together and just vote. But to do so, you need to register and do it soon.

**PLEASE REGISTER NOW!**

I will gladly find out how and where you can register in your state if you just tell me your city and state. 

**And please vote in November.** 



















 I've had it with ATT. Not because of the price or any other service. But because they continually manipulate and lies to me. Each month for the last six months I had to make that dreaded call to ask why my bill went up $20.  I would win the argument but then they would do it again the next month. 

Anyway, I need a new internet and TV service. Who should I get? 









 A really nice redditor provided us with this link on how to add an address to your Amazon wishlist. It was soooooo helpful. It saved the mods so many headaches trying to explain to people how to do that. They made it in pictures that was so simple anyone could understand it. Check it out:

* https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B37BFyksMPvcNUpNeW9VT0N2TGc/edit

What we really could use is the same thing that explains how to make an Amazon wishlist from scratch. It would be aimned at people who are not good at computers and have never made an Amazon wishlist before. Come Christmas we are running both subs and it is an insane amount of work for us. Explaining the wishlist consumes way too much of our time. The format with the pictures like the one above would be most preferred. 

Is there anyone who would be willing to make this for us? 

P.S. Christmas is closer than you think. :D 




 I promised to buy a needy Canadian some coffee. But every frickin' place I try to order it from will not send it to Canada  from the US. It doesn't have to come from the US. It can be sent from Canada to Canada. I just have to pay for it from the US.

Not looking for anything fancy. Just some plain old regular coffee. I've been trying for hours with no success. It's such a simple thing but is turning into a major hassle. Can you give me an online site that will allow me to send this poor woman some coffee?

----------------------

**EDIT:**

**Thank you all for your help. I finally found a place to do it. :D** 




 I run /r/santaslittlehelpers where we require requests to include am Amazon wishlist. We spend so much of our time coaching people in how to make a wishlist. Some of these users can barely send an email. It is so frustrating and time consuming for us.

We of course had the problem of them not adding their shipping address until a very kind redditor gave us this link to show them how:

*https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B37BFyksMPvcNUpNeW9VT0N2TGc/edit

It really helped out. Now we are looking for the same kind of thing that explains with pictures, how to make a basic wishlist.

Is there one in existence or would someone be willing to make one for us? 

Our subscribers last year provided over $20,000 of gifts from Amazon to those in need so you could see how frustrating it gets instructing so many to make a basic wishlist. To have a link we could give them that would explain it in the simplest of terms, with pictures like the link above, would be awesome beyond awesome.

Anyone out there know of one or would be willing to create one? 





























 I'm curious if people of reddit would consider this as an abuse of presidential powers. So many of you questioned  whether the president can legally authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen fighting for a foreign terrorist group in the past.

If so, what would make this case different than the other ones he targeted. If not, do you think he should be powerless if he can't get at him to bring back to America for trial? 












































 Yes. In fact your votes are the only ones that matter.
Elections are not decided by republicans or democrats. Their votes basically cancel each other out. They sway from one side back and forth, but rarely are the deciding factor.

In most presidential elections, the percentage difference is around 5%. If all the people who say their vote doesn't matter would vote, then they would matter. They would easily sway the vote one way or the other. The direction our country takes can easily be changed by a small percentage that does not vote. The very people who say their vote does not count.

**In practical reality, your votes are the only ones that do count.** 














 Last year saw the launch of our sister-sub, /r/SantaLittleHelpers. It was a smashing success and you awesome people made the difference for so. so many people.

We are currently working behind the scenes to not only supply Christmas for thousands, but to have the time of our lives doing it.

**We need your ideas for events, contests and just fun things to do over the six weeks we will be operating.**

Myself and others will be donating prizes for contests but we are looking for fun ways that keep us all in the spirit of Christmas. Please be creative. Of course we want to bring Christmas to those that who otherwise wouldn't have it. But we want to have fun while doing it. Looking forward to hearing your ideas.

Oh and by-the-way, here is our video from last year, in case you missed it.

And may I be the first to wish you all a Merry Christmas 2014. It'll be here before you know it. :D

 Hi,

I'm train_subject8344 of r/assistance. Each Christmas we provide tens of thousands of dollars worth of toys and presents to redditors around the world in our sister subreddit: /r/SantasLittleHeplers.

Right now the place looks like it was designed by a serial killer. I mean it is terrible. We want it to scream Christmas. Right now the only thing it screams is I don't have a clue how to of how to make a site look like Christmas.

We seriously want it to make it look like Santa had an acid trip there. So we are looking for someone to decorate the place up for us. Here is a real chance to show your creativity and help us bring Christmas joy to the world. Anyone feel like taking up the challenge?

 Some anonymous wonderful person just gave me a years worth of gold. You are a sweetheart and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Whoever you are. :D

**Edit: I knew it was you /u/helen73 - You are a most awesome person. Thank you for the gold and more for the kind words. You help me realize how wonderful of a place this is. :D** 
























 My eye sight sucks and I need an illuminated keyboard that is easy to read. The one I got before totally sucks because the keys are too close together and I am constantly accidentally hitting caps locks. And the shift key is sticky as hell. I absolutely hate it. 

So I am breaking down and getting a new one. I am not a gamer. Just an average smuck on a computer. Would love a recommendation for a medium priced keyboard to make this old man a little less grumpy.

Let me know if I should be posting this elsewhere.

Thanks. 














 The link to register your account has been changed since the old one was getting way to large to mange. (I mean manage) Your old registration is still good. 

From now on if you register use the new link. It is listed on the side bar in the place the old one was. 

Here it is just in case.

This should not effect anything (we hope) so just do business as usual. And let me know if you have any problems. 




 All it says on the page is a community for three years. I know it is more close to four years and just want to know the exact date.

 Something real slow and that uses simple chords. But real pretty when sung solo by a male? An old classic is preferable but not required.

It would be a toward the end song. You know when everyone is tired and ready to call it a night.

Almost like a lullaby type slow.

---------------------

Totally awesome suggestions. Keep 'em coming itf you would. Some of these may not be the ending lullabye but some that I will still want to work in.

But this is the song I think I'm going to go with. Tell me if you agree:

 I can think of no better way to allow legislation that the people want than to have votes on issues in a proposition style election like the states have. I imagine we would have to change the constitution to allow it but doesn't it make sense?
I've just never heard anyone suggest it before. 
























 This our true friend and a couple of the nurses won't let anyone visit here. She'll be gone in few days and it won't make any difference. Shouldn't she be allowed to be comforted by her friends in her last days?

What right do they have to keep people from visiting? 












































 I'm not going to say a word of what myself or the other person thinks  happened. Could you please tell me your expert opinion of what caused this event:

 Currently I can drive because I have epilepsy. I have never had a seizure in the 35 years I been at a driver's age, still they don't allow me to have a license. Do you think they will let have a self driven car? 









 People need to tag their posts in our subreddit. It is a quite simple task:

* http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/29ifmv/how_to_add_a_tag/

But the option to add a tag isn't showing up for some all of a sudden. It's worked perfectly fine in the past. They just click that option pictured here:


* http://i.imgur.com/UO28rZh.jpg


But some say it isn't  showing up for them. We've not had this problem in over a year of using it. Any speculation on what has caused the problem? Is it maybe it's just a temporary glitch? 




 It seems people are having trouble adding a tag.

Just click the add tag option under your post you just made:

* http://imgur.com/UO28rZh

Click on the proper tag (or type one yourself) and press **save**

That's it. It's two clicks and **save**

**Let me know if you still have a problem or the option to tag the post does not appear.**


 









 Something clever. It's at a protest rally at republican's office. 

**EDIT:** Maybe I should say we are protesting the congress' inaction on immigration reform 




 We are protesting congress' inaction on immigration at Ed Royce's (R) office. I need a clever protest sign. Help me please. 




 I'm supposed to be getting all these movies to choose from. Everything I search for costs money. The box is always orange with a price in it. They are supposed to be green and say instant watch. Am I in the wrong place. I am signed in and my Amazon Prime membership is active, but I can't find any free movies.
