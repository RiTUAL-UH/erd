 The third is that to the extent he stands for anything, it is for maintenance of a status quo that continues to wreck the country in order to service the greed of a few oligarchs.  The fourth is that he fundamentally does not understand the powers and the role of the modern presidency.  And the fifth is that he maintains the worst communications apparatus in the White House since Jimmy Carter prowled its corridors.  In fairness to his communications team, though, he has given them almost nothing to sell.  You try singing the praises of bailing out Goldman Sachs one hundred cents on the dollar, or of a health care plan that forces people to buy plans they don't want from hated insurance vultures.  It ain't easy, pal.  Yet, on the other hand, Bush and Cheney had far less than nothing to sell when it came to the Iraq war - indeed, they had nothing but lies - and their team handled that masterfully.

Could an ideology ever have been more obviously shown to be catastrophic in its effects?  And yet here we are arguing in public about doubling down on those policy ideas, while the two major political parties both pretend to be limiting the worst practices of the most predatory actors, as they simultaneously accept bags of money from the very same folks at the very same time."

Even a cursory glance at human history and most other forms of society outside the Western world reveal how culturally specific and temporal Economic Man really is; as the economic historian Karl Polanyi stated, no other society outside of our own has ever raised the pursuit of economic gain to the guiding principle of society or understood it as definitive of the human condition.

 Tangentially related -- my daughter diaper-trained herself at about 2 when we were staying at a beach in Africa where everyone peed and pooped in the sand dunes.  She went naked most of the time but the important thing was being with adults, both male and female, and watching their process, including burying the poop.

Took the mystery out of it for her anyway and gave her something to imitate. 




 Transparency, accountability and oversight -- in government at all levels, in business, Wall Street, Main Street.  These are not even partisan -- independents, sane Republicans, libertarians could get behind them.  They are general overarching goals that need specifics developed.

 Kindergarten through 12th grade.

So the article says. 




 from the article:
Ninety-five percent of criminologists study blue collar crime.

Five percent study white collar crime.

Of the tiny minority who study white collar crime, ninety five percent focus on the individuals who rip off the corporation.

We are left with a small handful of criminologists  think Edwin Sutherland, John Braithwaite, Gil Geis  who have studied or are studying  corporate crime.

That would be crime by the corporation.

Bill Black is one of the most prominent of those living corporate criminologists.

 The author of that quote, Naomi Klein, says elsewhere in the article:

 No, it's just a matter of us all being in this together.  Your health impacts me and my health impacts you.  Just as I'm happy if some of my tax money goes to educate your kids.

 Another single-Xer here, moved to respond by the flurry of thoughts and feelings triggered by your post and all the comments. 

There is something of value in all the comments and I'm heartened by all the good advice.  The basic issues seem to me to be related to how to be in the world, and they apply to all of us, of whatever age or gender.  I don't mean to denigrate the advice about makeup and clothes -- it's good advice and may be more accessible than 'deeper' issues.  

Even though you don't want to move in with your dad, I hope you can find a way to use your relationship with him as a source of strength.  And I suggest that it's helpful to remember that however misguided your mother is, she loves you and mostly intends what she says to be for what she thinks is good for you.  And you can love her back, this deeply flawed woman, without succumbing to her warped views.

Make no mistake, though, Qeraeth is right in characterizing this as emotional abuse.  Not many of us grew up without some abuse, but still I think it's better to call it what it is.  The thing to do is to use that knowledge to free yourself from the entanglements.  Detachment doesn't mean separation, just kind of getting unhooked (huge work at your age, but you're up to it).

Stay tight with friends who understand and support you without a lot of judgement.  You don't need to push the others away unless they're really toxic, just don't tune yourself to their opinions.

This sub-reddit looks like it could be a valuable resource for you.  Use what works and don't let the rest slow you down.  Bless you.

 




 The headline is a quote from two paragraphs above yours.  Though it would have been better without the quotation marks that imply it's a direct quote from Kucinich. 




 Interesting that there we no comments from tailgaters.  Because they dare not reply or because redditors are mostly too smart for that?  I'm inclined to think the latter. 




 Yeah, I do that sometimes.  Once to a cop who I hadn't noticed, but who dropped back quickly.  I've also had someone edge closer though. 




 You do realize the headline is a quote from the article, don't you? 




 Mine too. 




 Wrong presumption. 




 I appreciate the nuance and gentleness with with you approach this.

 Am I the moron for posting the link, or Booman, who posted the linked article, Why Obama Should Stop Forcing the Left to Eat Sh*t, in the Booman Tribune, or both of us? 




 It seems to me the best chance for effectiveness would come from supporting issues a broad spectrum could agree on, not something that would divide for leftists from libertarians, free marketeers from social democrats.  

There are a number of voting reform issues -- some kind of [preference voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_voting);  insuring the [integrity of the vote](http://www.verifiedvoting.org/); providing for expanded but verified registration; insuring that waiting lines for voting are reduced and are not skewed by voting district.

To the extent that we can call for accountability, transparency and oversight without having the arguments devolve into anti-regulatory rhetoric, those are overarching concerns that deserve wide support.  They also importantly allow for a correctable result instead of fixing even a good policy into place that later has unintended consequences.

A couple of personal favorites of mine are the abolition of corporate personhood, and opening media advertising to include issue advocacy so that the networks couldn't deny Adbusters, for example, the right to buy air time.  Those causes may have narrower support though.  




 Notice it said "unemployed or underemployed."

 *I was relegated to having to manage my passwords in a password utility called KeePass. Obviously not ideal.*

 Like its predecessors, the Obama administration treats additional government funding as a solution to unaffordable health care, rather than its cause. The current reform will likely expand our governments already massive role in health-care decision-makingall just to continue the illusion that someone else is paying for our care. 




 All of the health-care interest groupshospitals, insurance companies, professional groups, pharmaceuticals, device manufacturers, even advocates for the poorhave a major stake in the current system. Overturning it would favor only the 300 million of us who use the system andwhether we realize it or notpay for it. 




 The most important single step we can take toward truly reforming our system is to move away from comprehensive health insurance as the single model for financing care. And a guiding principle of any reform should be to put the consumer, not the insurer or the government, at the center of the system. 




 A wasteful insurance system; distorted incentives; a bias toward treatment; moral hazard; hidden costs and a lack of transparency; curbed competition; service to the wrong customer. These are the problems at the foundation of our health-care system, resulting in a slow rot and requiring more and more money just to keep the system from collapsing. 




 Only in the bizarre parallel universe of health care could limiting supply be seen as a sensible approach to keeping prices _down_. 




 Keeping prices opaque is one way medical institutions seek to avoid competition and thereby keep prices up. Without transparency on prices-and the related data on measurable outcomes-efforts to give the consumer more control over health care have failed, and always will. 




 Imagine confiscating all the profits of all the famously greedy health-insurance companies. That would pay for 4 days of health care for all Americans. Lets add in the profits of the 10 biggest rapacious U.S. drug companies. Another 7 days. Indeed, confiscating all the profits of all American companies, in every industry, wouldnt cover even five months of our health-care expenses. 




 For almost all our health-care needs, the current system allows us as consumers to ask providers, Whats my share? instead of How much does this cost?-a question we ask before buying any other good or service. And the subtle difference between those two questions is costing us all a fortune. 




 Insurance is probably the most complex, costly, and distortional method of financing any activity; thats why it is otherwise used to fund only rare, unexpected, and large costs. 




 There was nothing natural or inevitable about the way our system developed: employer-based, comprehensive insurance crowded out alternative methods of paying for health-care expenses only because of a poorly considered tax benefit passed half a century ago. 




 The federal government spends eight times as much on health care as it does on education, 12 times what it spends on food aid to children and families, 30 times what it spends on law enforcement, 78 times what it spends on land management and conservation, 87 times the spending on water supply, and 830 times the spending on energy conservation. Education, public safety, environment, infrastructure-all other public priorities are being slowly devoured by the health-care beast. 




 Unless we fix the problems at the foundation of our health system-largely problems of incentives-our reforms wont do much good, and may do harm. Health care will need to become subject to the same forces that have boosted efficiency and value throughout the economy. 




 The comprehensive reform being contemplated merely cements in place the current system-insurance-based, employment-centered, administratively complex. It addresses the underlying causes of our health-care crisis only obliquely, if at all; indeed, by extending the current system to more people, it will likely increase the ultimate cost of true reform. 




 Accidentally, but relentlessly, America has built a health-care system with incentives that inexorably generate terrible and perverse results. Incentives that emphasize health care over any other aspect of health and well-being. That emphasize treatment over prevention. That disguise true costs. That favor complexity, and discourage transparent competition based on price or quality. That result in a generational pyramid scheme rather than sustainable financing. And thatmost importantremove consumers from our irreplaceable role as the ultimate ensurer of value. 




 There needs to be a _business reason_ why an industry, year in and year out, would be able to get away with poor customer service, unaffordable prices, and uneven results. 




 The issue of "planting" came up in the comments but nothing in the article suggested that.  I didn't find anything in the article that would support the notion that it was a plant. 




 Forced Camel Case.  Even In Email Address. Not Right. 




 Why does americanoddjobs make irresponsible generalizations? 




 What kind of health care should be available to people that employ consistent poor decision-making over many years?  If they are very low income, as many of them are, how should it be funded? 




 How many supporters of life with parole for minors would include their own children and relatives?

 So if the author were charged with a crime, he presumably wouldn't assert a right to a trial by his peers.

Rights may be characterized as intrinsic, but that doesn't mean they can't be granted.  Over time, societies come to grant expanded rights.  

Many countries now treat health care as a right.  Some of wish to join them.

 Resources on aging seem to be mostly about slowing, resisting, preventing, delaying or diminishing.  Where are some resources that deal with *preparing* for dimished capacity?  Examples:

*  Dealing with no longer being able to live in your own home
*  Accepting help with tasks you used to do yourself
*  Allowing health care 'strangers' to assist you with intimate functions
*  Learning to accept that others'judgements may be more competant than your own

 From William Gibson's [Pattern Recognition (2003)] (http://www.scribd.com/doc/10073557/William-Gibson-Pattern-Recognition-2003):
If there's any one thing about England that Cayce finds fundamentally disturbing, it is how "class" works--a word with a very different mirror-world meaning, somehow. She's long since given up trying to explain this to English friends.

The closest she can come is that it's somewhat akin, for her, if only in its enormity, to how the British seem to feel about certain American attitudes to firearms ownership which they generally find unthinkable, and bafflingly self-evidently wrong, and so often leading to a terrible and profligate waste of human life. And she knows what they mean, but also knows how deeply it runs, the gun thing, and how unlikely it is to change.  Except, perhaps, gradually, and over a very long time. Class in England is like that, for her.

I find this provocative.  Does it resonate? 




 Wouldn't that be like someone from Latin America calling him 'amigo'?

 I recently read a href="http://www.economicgangsters.com/" rel="nofollow"Economic Gangsters: Corruption, Violence, and the Poverty of Nations/a.  It fit well with my interests but I was especially impressed by the authors' emphasis on research and the analysis of data rather than ideology.  Their advocacy for randomized trials looks fruitful where they are even possible.  

How is a layman with no economic training supposed to judge among economic explanations and prescriptions?  Either FDR exacerbated the Depression with his policies or he ameliorated it, but where is the objective basis for which side to choose?  Keynes and von Mises may both be wrong, but both can't be right.  

Sometimes I'm able to criticize the premises of an economic argument or definition.  For example, excluding 'women's work' from GDP calculations seems flawed from the start.  But often I am too easily influenced by the most recent argument I encounter, without anything but my gut to help me.

Most economic reasoning looks to me like its coming from different sides of the elephant, with little hope of agreement.  Is this all there is?

Surely there must be a better way.

 I recently had a couple of visits to my VA medical center and was handled at least as well as at my previous HMO.  Even asked about getting a future appointment moved up and they said come in tomorrow around 10am.  I showed up at 8:30 and was quickly registered.  Sure I waited for the procedure but I got out of there about 2pm after a CT scan and was happy with the whole procedure.  They were actually more efficient than the HMO but the HMO experience was years ago. 




 so that they can defend **against** it...  Right? 




 I had been having increasing lower back pain for a couple of months.  My physician did nothing except give the okay for me to take nightly ibuprofen and acetaminophen.  Spent $25 for a brief session with a chiropractor at my local gym and he relieved most of the pain in that session.  Probably the best $25 I ever spent.

 These pieces are all worth reading but I found the one by Roger Schank especially compelling: 

To learn to predict well, one needs to be educated about how to predict and one needs to make predictions and to examine what went wrong when those predictions fail. Curiously the schools teach none of this.

The idea that kids can make predictions is not a really radical point. My point is that prediction has to be the curriculum and not be ancillary to the curriculum.

 




 Kale and chard are good too.  Tasting the greens is something to relish, not avoid.  Just go at it gradually. 




 If we really believed that accountability works, wouldn't we have accountability for all public servants? Why do we not require our legislators to make "Adequate Yearly Progress"? We have the data from their congressional districts, do we not? There is crime data, health care data, poverty figures, and drug use statistics for every state and federal legislative district. Why, exactly, do we not establish annual targets for our legislators to meet? 

Excellent interview.
 




 Thanks for the advice. 




 No offense taken.  Thanks for your perspective from the repair side. 




 Where in the world is killing a giraffe not like shooting fish in a barrel? 




 Yeah, I hadn't understood a triple entendre correctly.  Three-word pun it is. 




 A really old triple I enjoyed was the suggestion of what to call a cattle ranch that a man is setting up for his boys:  Focus.  (Where the sons raise meat.) 




 President Obama tells us that he's asked the Pentagon whether the conditions of confinement of Bradley Manning, the soldier charged with leaking state secrets, "are appropriate and are meeting our basic standards. They assure me that they are."


If Obama believes that, he'll believe anything. I would hope he would know better than to ask the perpetrators whether they've been behaving appropriately.

Even if you believe Manning deserves punishment, this is unconscionable.

 Yeah, the yellow pins on your world map look like they're near AU/NZ but they don't indicate actual distances or travel time.

We had 3 months each in AU and NZ in 2007.  Well worth the time.  Especially NZ.  Their maps had scenic roads marked but I told them I would be better to mark unscenic roads since they only had a couple in the entire country. 




 Did you mean to skip New Zealand and Australia when
 you were so close? 




 Not at all persuasive for me.  I found it superficial. 




 As far as I'm concerned it Ith'nt kuil.  Reminds me of the programming language APL -- so dense a person can't figure out their code an hour after they wrote it. 




 Put a half-gallon pitcher of water in the fridge with 3 or 4 herbal teabags in it.  (My favorites are licorice and spice.)  Just enough flavor and the cost is low. 




 I downloaded 5 in an unusable format, then corrected it for 6 and 7.  That's was a few months ago and now the site that worked before doesn't any longer.

 This is a poignant essay on acting, social roles, empathy and unbearable heaviness.  Recommended. 




 I found the emphasis to be more on the time it takes to arrive at forgiveness than whether to forgive at all.  Reminds me of hearing one of the South African members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission saying that Americans are much too quick to offer what amounts to a shallow forgiveness. 




 Wow, we're all over the place with our comments here.  Connoisseurs recommending fine Scotch, two-buck Chuck fans, Miller Lite as a worthy purchase.  (As a drinker of stout, something like Miller Lite ranks with Kool-Aid.)

I remember reading some wine reviewer who said box wines were perfectly okay, just depending on what's in them, as is the same with bottles.

I asked my local Grocery Outlet to stock 5-liter Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon.  Some while later I found a pallet of Almaden Shiraz for $5.99 a box.  Sorry to say I only bought 4 boxes because there hasn't been any more.  I should have bought the whole pallet. 




 How can you think critical thinking skills are exempt from genetic influence? 




 But while fertility is determined by culture, an individuals predisposition toward religion is likely to be influenced by genetics, in addition to their upbringing.

If there's a religiosity gene, maybe there's a gene that influences the desire for more children. 




 You've got some extra unnecessary redundancy there. 




 There are some issues that cross political boundaries -- accountability, transparency and oversight.  Even moderate Republicans can support some version of these.  The devil is in the details though, so they can be twisted into their evil twins -- bureaucracy, loss of control, nanny-state regulations.

We need to use framing and repetition to promote our version of those issues.  The right wing has mastered framing and repetition.  We should take a note from their play book.

 The headline isn't the OP's, it's from the original article. 




 The real Dominant Paradigm -- the one held by the overwhelming majority of people on the planet -- is more decentralized and amorphous, yet is grounded in shared values that merit enunciation. These include: a belief in the virtues of community; a desire to be part of something greater than oneself; a reciprocal relationship with nature and life's essential resources; an aversion to open hostilities and devastating warfare; an interest in the wellbeing of others as a precondition of personal prosperity; an adherence to culturally-transcendent principles such as the Golden Rule; and a willingness to work hard in return for an equitable existence. 




 1.	On the first legislative day of a new Congress, the Senate may, by majority vote, end a filibuster on a rules change and adopt new rules.

2.	There should only be one opportunity to filibuster any given measure or nomination, so motions to proceed and motions to refer to conference should not be subject to filibuster.

3.	Secret "holds" should be eliminated.

4.	The amount of delay time after cloture is invoked on a bill should be reduced.

5.	There should be no post-cloture debate on nominations.

6.	Instead of requiring that those seeking to break a filibuster muster a specified number of votes, the burden should be shifted to require those filibustering to produce a specified number of votes to continue the filibuster.

7.	Those waging a filibuster should be required to continuously hold the floor and debate.

8.	Once all Senators have had a reasonable opportunity to express their views, every measure or nomination should be brought to a yes or no vote in a timely manner. 




 Thanks.  First thing that worked (Chrome).

 Some cities are using alternative voting, usually some instant runoff system.  I'm hopeful that successes at lower levels could spread upwards.

Some years ago I read/heard an interview with a guy, I think Kalle Lasn of Adbusters, who had worked with anti-tobacco advertising that was successful in reducing the incidence of young people taking up smoking.  You may remember the ads with a cigarette that looked glamorous until it drooped in a display of impotence.  He wanted to do similar things with social issues but was prevented by the media's ability to deny advocacy advertising.  When the interviewer pointed out that even if he were allowed to create such ads, the money backing them would be a pittance against what the monied powers could amass.  Kalle (or whoever) replied that they didn't need to blanket the airways -- with just a foot in the door they could do serious damage to the conventional wisdom.

 Many years ago I heard of a man who single-handedly killed a leopard.  I don't remember if there was any explanation of how he did it but the 'fact' of it was common knowledge among his coworkers.

Seems like a wolf would be easier because of lacking the raking ability of the hind claws. 




 Nope, California. 




 All I know is from spending 3 months there in 2007.  We paid way too much for internet time (5-10 NZ$ per hour).  But if you were there permanently you wouldn't have to pay by the hour. 




 A lot of you youngsters aren't nearly radical enough for me.  Quite a few of us senior citizens in my community are progressive. 




 I'm nave enough to think there are some cross-partisan issues that promise a broad appeal.  **Transparency, accountability, oversight.**  I realize the far right doesn't like these but they line up with notions we learned in Civics class about how democracy is supposed to work.  

Voting reform is important and would increase the percentage of voters if they thought their vote made a difference.  [Range Voting](http://rangevoting.org/) has impressed me the best but almost any alternative to winner-take-all would be an improvement.

Changing the ability of media to deny advocacy advertising would open a wedge for some creative [culture jamming](http://www.adbusters.org/).

There would be plenty of opposition to these kinds of issues but at least they ought not to splinter any movement of ours internally. 




 Thanks for the mention of /r/neoprogs/.  I'm in.

 Hear, hear!  I may be an old fart but I'm not in charge.  And don't forget that Sanders is no youngster, nor is Chomsky and even Kucinich just turned 64.  If we were in charge there would be a very different game. 




 In all the comments about moving, nobody has mentioned New Zealand.  Too far away? 




 Rationality, the idea that individual's purchase decisions are based on value or perceived value in a product, and that firms are motivated by profit-seeking is rarely far from the truth.


What do you think of behavioral economics?  I've only read Dan Ariely, Barry Schwartz, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein.  But they leave me persuaded that there's a lot more irrationality than you seem to think. 




 Nothing in the headline was just my opinion.  It's all from the article. 




 Robert Reich is a **political economist** and his article is titled **The Big Economic Story**.  So maybe there's some overlap between politics and economics. 




  We knew that, politically, once you get it into law, it becomes almost impossible to remove it. Thats not a bad legacy. The fact that we were able to lay the trap does feel pretty good, to tell you the truth.


Disgusting.
 




 Unifying and simple, yes.  How about transparency, accountability and oversight?  These should have appeal across the spectrum. 




 On math as an art form, check out this [25-pg critique of traditional math instruction](http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf).

 We're talking about a major political party, which will control much of Congress next year, possibly undermining the strength of the country -- on purpose, in public, without apology or shame -- for no other reason than to give themselves a campaign advantage in 2012.

Maybe now would be a good time to pause and ask a straightforward question: are Americans O.K. with this?
 




 Do these fit in here? -- months of the year in the modern calendar, days of the week. 




 About some doctors in the Nazi death camps:

They would do what they could to help, except for the most important thing of all, which is they wouldnt question the existence of the entire death camp itself. So they would find themselves working within the rules, however they could, to try to improve conditions marginally. And in retrospect, of course, thats just not sufficient. And as a longtime activist, I see myself and other activists doing the same thing, that what we do is we do everything that is allowed by those in power to attempt to stop their destruction. But the problem is, whenever we figure out a way to use their rules to actually stop them, they change the rules.
 




 Hey, in 1968 I voted for Eldridge Cleaver.  And in 2008, Cynthia McKinney.  No turn to the right for me. 




 I'm one of those who thought so.  I also thought the country was too smart to elect Reagan president.

So now I'm one of the old generation.  Not all of us are in your way. 




 This is unconscionable:

Now they are using their political power and control over the media to attack Social Security. 

This effort is being led by billionaire investment banker Peter Peterson. Mr. Peterson has personally profited to the tune of tens of millions of dollars from the "fund managers' tax subsidy," an obscure provision of the tax code that allows billionaires to pay a lower tax rate than schoolteachers and firefighters. However, Peterson believes in giving back. He has committed $1 billion to an effort that is intended to take away the Social Security benefits that people have worked and paid for.
 




 It's worth reading all 20 of his points, not just #16 that all the comments mention so far. 




 You know this how? 




 I doubt xourtney meant **all** ladies.  I was reading what I assumed was her intent, rather than picking on her locution. 




 Absolutely we need broader cultural change, a paradigm shift. I wasn't looking for a magical solution.  Anyway, you don't think introducing it in middle school is a bad idea, do you? 




 The OP said *sometimes* so your fix didn't correct much. 




 Start introducing it in middle school. 




 One automaton, two automata, three automata, four... 




 My generation has devised a system in which one man can make enough money in a year to pay the salaries of every police officer, firefighter, and public school teacher in the city of Chicago, while paying a lower percentage in taxes than the people cleaning his offices. That's why many of you young people don't have a job. 




 No need to disdain the girl for saying no.   




 "some idea" != "exactly" 




 The Republicans have done their best to make this election about fear and hate. That is their brand of sand.

Democrats are cooperating nicely, by refusing to engage in a values debate.

The only question is, why?

For many people the answer is simple: voters don't really have a choice; the political process is nothing more than a Kabuki dance in which both sides represent corporate America and the uber-rich, while playing their respective roles in public.

That answer is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Believing it makes it so.

But even if it's true, we, the people are the only power capable of changing that reality. We can start by refusing to drink the sand.

 I had a monkey as a kid, a vervet.  One of her traits was that she was extremely jealous.  She would scold anyone she thought was getting too much of my attention and even bite them if she could.  Since then I've thought that monkeys aren't very good pets.

Was Abu jealous? 




 For a religion that is pretty much free of greedy, powermad leaders, look at [Unitarianism](http://uua.org/). 




 Part of the cultural shift we need is to stop referring to those jobs as *menial work*.  Camille Paglia wasn't talking about ditch digging.

 All this advice about getting drunk is not really what you want to follow.  A beer or a glass of wine is fine but you don't want to be drunk.

Even if what you think is in no way under your control, I'm determined to be interested. 




 Man, what a lot of great advice here.  Follow even half of it and you'll be in good shape.

About starting young:  I once heard a comparison between someone who saves a fixed amount over a period of 30 years from the age of 35 until 65 vs someone who saves the same amount over an 11-year period from 19 to 35, and then keeps the money in investments.  At age 65 the early saver has about **twice** the amount as the late starter.

The distinction between needs and wants is critical.  Keep a list and when you see something you want, make it a point not to buy it right away but add it to the list and review and prioritize the whole list before buying anything big.  Make sure the list includes all the responsible stuff such as the 6-month or 12-month emergency fund.

When you're in a store being tempted by some shiny toy, take of picture of it.  You'll find an even more tempting toy soon -- take a picture of that too.  Soon you'll have a photo collection of ephemeral wants that will make you smile embarrassedly like reading your diary from third grade.  




 No one mentioned giving up A/C.  Even without reading the article you can see it's talking about "lavish use" and "reducing our dependence."

 More than my trimmed-down selection. :) 




 After decades of hyper-militant consumerism and its attending alienation, and a national consciousness spun from pure capitalist bullshit and mirrors, it is testimony to the American people that they can still see to piss straight, much less recognize any sort of truth whatsoever. Yet, a portion of Americans are beginning to grasp the truth about what has happened to their country -- that it has been bought and paid for by an elite class in a nation that is supposed to be classless. 




 The ruling class holds all the money, not to mention the media that informs the populace as to what is going on in our country. It controls our health care, our banking and retirement funds. It controls our education or lack of education, and it controls the price, quantity and quality of the food we eat. It controls the quality of the air we breathe, and soon, through pollution credits, even the price they will pay for that air. Most importantly, it holds concentrated legal and governmental authority, not to mention the machinery of both parties to grant itself more authority. 




 We no longer take effective action, because it has become impossible to identify what we might do to change anything. Instead, we react to events. That is what the ruling class wants, because if we are reactive, then outcomes can be controlled by controlling the stimuli. 




 You never hear them say it, but neo-conservatives understand that they have a mean streak down inside. They also know if they want to share in the national plunder, they must win hearts and minds. They must look pious and sound right while lying through their teeth and picking our pockets. In other words, they have an astute grasp of American politics and business -- which are the same thing, of course. 




 I have seldom met an American who understood how the ruling class got so rich. Simply put, it was through constant cultivation of bigger and more labyrinthine government, creating legal and technical complexities to sluice money nationally and globally in their direction, and to cover their asses in the process. 




 America has always had a ruling class, and it has always bullshitted the world that it doesn't. But at least the ruling class of the past was interesting and varied, because diverse sorts of Americans were getting rich. 




 Nobody in Washington disputed the ruling class's right to dictate policy. After all, the political class agreed with the ruling class's major premise: The public does not know shit, never has, never will. 




 Both parties forced banks to make high rate home loans to people who people who did not qualify, because the inflated home values during the expanding bubble would make billions for big investors who knew when to get out. Should they stay too long at the fair and go bust, they would set up the howl of "too big to fail." 




 This political class stands between all of us down here and the tiny minority in the ruling class waaaaaay up there, wherever the hell up there is. No use to squint. You can't see it from where we are. That comes in mighty handy in denying the existence of a ruling class. 




 Reaching out to independents or "moderate" Republicans couldn't hurt though, huh? 




 Thanks, I'll check it out. 




 All I've read so far is the talk by Jonathan Haidt.  I found it to be outstanding and it makes me want to read all the others. 




 Redditculous. 




 If war were undisguisedly as nasty and brutish as it truly is, it might also tend to be short.  Soldiers freed from illusions might mutiny, as many did in Vietnam, or desert and go home.  But this modern, cushier kind of pseudo-war is different.  


The odd thing is that no one seems to question the relative cushiness of this life at war (nor the inequity of the hardscrabble civilian life left behind) -- least of all those best able to observe firsthand the contrast between our garrisons and the humble equipment and living conditions of Afghans, both friend and foe.  Rather, the contrast seems to inspire many soldiers with renewed appreciation of "our American way of life" and a determination to "do good things" for the Afghan people, just as many feel they did for the people of Iraq.  


Most infantry missions are "presence patrols," described by one officer as "walking around in places where we won't get shot at just to show the Afs [Afghans] that we're keeping them safe."  


In a typical mess-up on the actual terrain of Afghanistan, Army experts previously in charge of this base had already had a million-dollar suspension bridge built over a river some distance away, but hadn't thought to secure land rights, so no road leads to it.  Now the local American agriculture specialist wants to introduce alfalfa to these waterless, rocky mountains to feed herds of cattle principally pastured in his mind.

 "...look **good** on a small screen."  See [Good vs. Well](http://data.grammarbook.com/blog/adjectives-adverbs/good-v-well/). ); 




 That's one theory but not the likeliest one.  There are [others](http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20000913). 




 It would appear that this applies to politicians pretty much all the time. 




 I don't care if you went into a stall just to spread disinfectant on your hands -- when you come out of a stall, ffs wash your hands.  The symbolism of the thing is as important as the real health aspect.  I wouldn't want your shoe on my dining table even if it's brand new out of the box and has been disinfected. 




 time appears to be running out on monoculture and many other standard practices of agribusiness, just as it is on so many of the thoughtless ways the civilized world does business. One clue to this: When a problem arises, we fight back with more of the same, except in higher - more lethal - doses. Indeed, that impulse, to *fight back*, to turn everything into a war, rather than to study, ponder and revere our obstacles, is the ultimate manifestation of our unawareness. 




 How about making all error messages selectable so the user can do a cut-and-past with them? 




 You appreciate being able to help others -- wouldn't some of your friends appreciate hearing about your dark thoughts?  Could you try it with one of them who is most likely to listen without trying to fix anything?  

Maybe it doesn't help to remind yourself that you're denying others the very thing you like to provide for them.  But a two-way would likely be more deeply satisfying than a one-way.
