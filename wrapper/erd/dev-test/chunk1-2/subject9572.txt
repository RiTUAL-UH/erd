 Happy Reddit Birthday! 




 I think the special prices are relative to the monthly prices, not relative to the one year price. You get a savings on the one, two or three year prices if you use any of the monthly prices as your reference.

 Particles from the sun, such as those from a solar flare, travel much slower than light and therefore the delay. 




 The article loses credibility when the title states "... Should Hit Early Tuesday Morning (2/13/2011)"  Tuesday is not 2/13. 




 Not really.  The difference between a hard drive and a solid state drive is more than semantics.  They are physically quite different approaches to storage.  I'm betting it's an error in the ad.

 In terms of solar masses, the MW black hole is not 1,000 but 4,000,000.  The article states the M87 black hole 6.6 billion solar masses, while the MW black hole is 4 million solar masses.

6.6 billion / 4 million = 1650 so the M87 black hole is a 1650 times more massive than the MW black hole.

 




 The existence of anti-matter has been proved by many experiments. Scientists generate and measure anti-matter particles every day in particle accelerators. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter 




 mr_lightswitch is correct, I should have stated "... over a thousand times more massive that the Milky Way's central black hole"

 Too late, I closed my account with B of A 15 years ago.  The reason? They said my account was overdrawn.  I checked my account balance and had more than $2K in it.  I called them up and they said, oh sorry we made a mistake.  Two weeks later same thing happened so I went into the branch.  They looked up my account and said, now Mr. Sheridan, we've had this conversation with you before and this is becoming a recurring problem.  I said, no shit, this is a recurring problem. Now close my account and give me my balance right now. They finally realized there was a different Mr. Sheridan whose account was overdrawn.  It was disturbing they couldn't even keep the accounts of two people with the same last name straight.

 Impressive aircraft in many respects.  Example 1: It was designed to leak fuel while on the ground (ok, maybe they couldn't help this) then seal itself as thermal expansion of joints took effect when the aircraft came up to temperature due to heating from air friction at operational speeds.

 Apparently you don't see the number of down votes you're receiving and recognize you're way off base, at least with respect to leading scientific theories.  

Maybe you're starting your own dark matter theory here on Reddit.  If it blows your dress up, go for it. 




 Once you create a facility that deep, you get multiple uses since many experiments are corrupted by cosmic rays. The mine is used to detect muons (product of cosmic ray collisions), neutrinos and dark matter.   




 I've stopped trying to figure out the rationale for up vs down votes. 




 Not to be argumentative, but dark matter is not the same as a black hole, at least according to the leading theories.  Dark matter appears to be more or less uniformly distributed within each galaxy, not necessarily between the galaxies and not tied up in individual localized black holes.  It is affected by gravity but not other forces such as electromagnetism.  Therefore dark matter is gravitationally attracted to galaxies as is ordinary matter.  

Dark matter is the only explanation scientists have for the orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters and the rotational speed of individual galaxies (spinning on their own axes).  Without the extra unseen mass explained by dark matter, galaxies would not behave as they do as they spin.

The vast majority of the dark matter in the universe is believed to be made up of nonbaryonic particles, and thus not formed out of atoms and not wrapped in the confines of black holes.

 At the rate it is traveling (~17 km/sec) it will take Voyager about 60 billion years to arrive at Andromeda, our nearest galaxy at a distance of about 2 million light years.  Keeping in mind our entire universe is a only ~13 billion years old, it is doubtful the sun and earth, let alone the human race, will even exist if/when it arrives.  Doesn't sound like a practical solution. 




 Agreed

 By "accepts wind from any direction" I mean from any direction in the horizontal plane, not from above or below.  This is true because the device is circularly symmetric so wind striking it from N, S, E or W will have the same affect on the turbine's rotation. 




 Yea, would like to see some numbers.  The best we have to go on is "... final costs of about $1.50/watt rated output, which is roughly 2/3 the cost of comparable bladed units."  Not a huge improvement but significant enough to pursue if it can be put to practice. 

I don't think the bladeless turbine needs a swivel base since it accepts wind from any direction unlike a bladed turbine - another advantage for the bladeless design.

 Thank you for that explanation.  Another response from an expert - two for two today.

Follow up question to your statement that we can measure dark energy.  How is that done?  Is the estimate based on the acceleration of the universe's expansion or some other method?   




 Wow, a response from an expert - thank you.  

Do you think the same is true with dark energy, that is no connection with hidden dimensions?

 Actually if you consider both Northern and Southern hemispheres each have a Vernal and Autumnal equinox, just 180 deg out of phase with each other, the article is correct in saying the Vernal equinox happens twice each year.  




 Correction, GMT-7 not GMT-8, at least for the next couple weeks until the rest of the world goes onto daylight savings time.  I really hate that the U.S. decided to mess around with the daylight savings time dates. 




 The article is a bit misleading when it says the Vernal equinox occurs twice a year.  Actually an equinox occurs twice a year but one is the Vernal and the other is the Autumnal.  They sort of clear it up in the last part of the sentence when they mention both. 




 You are correct but the planned shut down won't be for a while.  In a couple weeks they will start slamming the beams together to achieve 7 TeV collisions and keep that up for 18 - 24 months.  After the 7 TeV tests they plan to shut LHC down for a year or more. They need the break to complete repairs for an electrical failure that occurred in 2008 and to prepare the collider for the maximum 14 TeV collisions.  That'll be when the real sparks fly.

 That is sufficiently close to sunset for the satellite to still be in view of the Sun and then pass into the Earth's shadow. 




 CliffDropOver is correct.  Eventually the satellite will pass into the Earth's shadow and appear to fade away.  How close in time to sunset/sunrise were you when you saw the satellite fade? 




 Oh, thanks for the clarification. 




 By the way, reddit put the NSFW tag on the link so they would seem to agree.

 No one has mentioned security yet. OSX has security vulnerabilities just like any OS, but Apple does not respond to these vulnerabilities as quickly as they should. Microsoft has shown an increased vigilance that Apple could learn from. Because Apple has enjoyed decades of small percentage market penetration theyve lulled themselves into thinking theyre more secure, but its really because they havent been attacked. The numbers are growing dramatically, and in my view it's simply a matter of time before the Mac OS experiences a big time hack. This is from a Mac fan boy. 




 I believe you are correct.  The sun is much larger with respect to the planet sizes than shown at any of the planet scale slider settings.  Also the planets are much too large in relation to their orbit sizes when the setting is at 1.0. 




 If so, God help us. 




 I am an electrical engineer and of all the classes I had at the undergraduate level, thermodynamics was the worst.  I could relate entropy to chaos but I couldn't translate the concept to "practical" problems. I'll never forget the problem: "A drop of rain falls from the sky into the ocean.  Does the entropy of the universe increase or decrease?" I had the class for 10 weeks and still couldn't get the answer to make intuitive sense.   




 I believe a photon is a fundamental quantum particle - doesn't break down any further (at least with today's physics). 




 nice 




 Couldn't agree more.  My wife and I who are both Apple fans bought one.  Weren't satisfied with its restrictions so we hacked it with ATVFlash to get more control and access of media not on iTunes.  Hack was too quirky and unreliable so we sold the AppleTV after a couple months and bought a Mac Mini instead.   We realized we needed a much more open media center, not a device that operates through iTunes like a big iPod (or should I say iPad?) 




 I like your take on this and have changed my mind.  U.S. broadband speeds are not shameful, just disappointing.  But I can (and obviously will) live with it.  We are fortunate to live in the times we do. 




 Magnetism is a subcomponent of light.  Light is an electromagnetic (electric + magnetic) phenomenon where both are intimately and orthogonally coupled.  So yes, the effect of magnetism travels at (not less than) the speed of light.

The answer to your question is yes, the other magnet would continue to repel for the time it took light (electromagnetism) to travel the distance between the two magnets. 




 Yes it's much more practical and economical to implement higher speed broadband in smaller countries.  Here's a site to give you a feel for broadband speeds in the U.S. http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/ 




 Understand and it probably won't come to pass, but look where the U.S. broadband speed currently stands wrt other nations http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Images/commentarynews/broadbandspeedchart.jpg

 Thanks for the link.  Aldrin's quote is summarized here:
"There is a monolith there, a very unusual structure on this little potato-shaped object that goes around Mars once every seven hours. When people find out about that, they are going to say 'who put that there?'. Well, the universe put it there, or if you choose, God put it there." 




 Thanks, now that is helpful.

 I'd go for the PS3.  I watch blu-ray and my son does gaming on the PS3.  It has worked well for over two years for both applications.

 The angle subtended by the black hole would be minuscule compared to the angle subtended by the massive galaxy, assuming the black hole was about midway between the Milky Way and the other galaxy.  This means the black hole would create a very small area of distortion in the image of the galaxy as viewed by a high power telescope (say Hubble).  Although some of the galaxy's image will be directly blocked (absorbed) by the black hole, much of this dark area will be filled in by light being bent (due to gravitational lensing) around the black hole.   




 Black holes theorized to be at the center of most galaxies are not good candidates for direct observation.  A black hole in the center of a galaxy is obscured by numerous stars, dust and other galactic debris shrouding the center.  That includes the black hole in the center of our galaxy.  Galactic centers are pretty dense areas. 




 I believe we can estimate the mass of a black hole pretty well for the case you give (a binary system containing a black hole and a star) for the reason you stated.  The path of the visible star is affected in a measurable way.  Scientists can estimate the mass of most visible stars pretty accurately based on distance and brightness.  Given the mass of the visible star and the diameter of its rotation around the unseen object (black hole) they can measure the mass of the black hole fairly accurately.  

I may not understand what you're getting with your comment on the "extra gravity".   You may be thinking that dark matter is matter that falls into a black hole?  If so, that is not dark matter.  Scientists theorize that dark matter is generally distributed around the galaxy and is not localized within black holes.  Although any matter can fall into a black hole (dark or energetic) and increase its mass accordingly.  It's all the same to the black hole.  Once it falls in, it is no longer defined as dark or anything else, it's just added mass to the black hole.

Yes, the black hole's event horizon will increase in size as it becomes more massive and this extra mass is quite measurable when the black hole is paired up with a star.  Other methods can be used to measure a black hole's mass such as gravitation lensing.

Another example of matter that interacts very weakly with other matter is the neutrino.  Neutrinos have almost negligible mass, no charge, travel nearly at the speed of light and do not interact with matter (almost). The mass and speed of neutrinos are still not certain and are being investigated. 




 Tyson is using the term "us" loosely.  Dark matter does not interact with us as individuals in a way we can measure directly on Earth.  But it does interact with the rest of our Milky Way galaxy and other galaxies as well as larger structures (galaxy clusters).  Astrophysicists have measured the rotation of these galaxies and stars within the galaxies.  They can't explain how the galaxies' rotations occur when they consider only the visible stars.  Keep in mind the rotation is not just the galaxy as a whole but the rotation rates of stars within the galaxies at varying distance from the galactic center. The only explanation that explains the internal rotations is additional mass distributed in and around the galaxies that cannot be seen (dark) and does not interact with electromagnetic energy.  
 




 Much better video.  Thank you. 




 A solar system reference frame is defined by the Sun not the Earth.  The Earth revolves around the Sun at many thousands of miles per hour.  If the helicopter is fixed with respect to the Sun, the Earth will immediately either slam into it or zoom away from at many thousands of miles per hour (depending on which side of the earth the helicopter is located with respect to the Earth's motion around the Sun) as it revolves around the Sun.  The pilot will either be crushed by the collision or be left in space to suffocate and freeze.  This won't take 12 hours but seconds
 
Did you possibly mean the Earth as the reference frame?  That is the only reference frame where fractions of a day (12 or 24 hrs) come into play. 




 Yes, you can have a point fixed in an expanding universe.   Think of an expanding balloon where the surface of the balloon is the reference frame. As the balloon (universe) expands, the point will expand with it.  Locally it will appear fixed but it will be moving away from other fixed points like points on the balloon's surface.  

You don't need to have a center to have a fixed point.  In this analogy, the balloon's surface has no center (the interior of the balloon is not part of the analogy, just the surface).  The same holds true with the universe. 




 No 




 Your scenario about a "fixed point in space" is ambiguous.  Space has many frames of reference: the earth, solar system, galaxy, galaxy cluster, super cluster and universe.  Each of these "space" reference frames moves at a different speed and rotates (and expands) at a different rate.  So first clarify your reference frame ... do you really mean the solar system or the earth or something else as your reference frame?  The answer to your question depends entirely on your reference frame.

When I think of a "fixed point in space", I think of the universe. 




 When it comes to advancing science at this level we often can't predict what the benefits will be.  Consider when the lasing effect was predicted by Einstein then later confirmed in the 60's through the invention of the laser.  Uses for the laser are almost too many to list but I'm guessing Einstein or the inventor or even the science community at large had no idea what the laser would eventually bring to our world.  
























 No pun intended.

 Amazing how they captured the crashing sounds of the CME ;-) 




 Well put. 




 I concur with what you're saying, but one point of correction:

 Many particles, such as electrons, are considered "point particles" in that they have zero dimension and take up exactly zero space. They have zero mass as well, and as such, travel at the speed of light.

That is not correct. You may be thinking of a photon. An electron does have mass and does not travel at the speed of light, maybe close but not equal to c.  




 Agreed.  A great many of the empirical tests they ran in '59 would now be run through simulation on a computer. 




 Not sure, but I'd like to know. 




 No, the headline is correct - the first thief reports the (implied second) theft to the police.  Reread the story. 




 I have them an use their color options on occasion.  I agree with Algorab.  The app definitely needs an upgrade.

 Unfortunately, C is for Crash. 




 I have observed this with several people.  It's not guaranteed but Apple will usually do this if:
1) you don't lie about the water damage
2) you are polite to the Apple employee 




 Patent filed a year ago, disclosed this morning. 




 I find it very surprising Apple's graphics chipsets don't support H.264 encoding in Macs as late as early 2011 given 1) how firmly Apple supported this standard and 2) the chipset is in iPads but not Macs.  Does Air Parrot perform the same function in software? 




 My favorite equation.  It brings so many mathematical properties together.

 Favorite part of S05E01: Jesse comes up with the idea to use a magnet.  




 Good question.  I would guess the overall mass of the proton is the determined by the quarks' direct interactions with the Higgs field plus the mass equivalent of the interaction energy between the quarks interacting with the Higgs field.  Otherwise the proton's mass would just reflect the measly sum of the three quarks' mass.   




 Note the comment "all **eligible** Apple products are back on EPEAT."  The intentionally unstated point is that fewer Apple products will be eligible for an EPEAT rating. 




 I have a V shaped scar on my side just below my ribs. Happened when as an 8 year old I was climbing a tree with a friend.  He was out on the end of a branch and i was near the trunk on the same branch.  He climbed out a bit too far and branch gave way. We both fell.  He fell into a mud puddle and I fell onto a wire fence which impaled me in my side.  Luckily no internal organs were damaged but I received 32 stitches in the shape of a V.  I'm amazed I don't have a fear of heights and still like to climb. 




 Ah, I see it is but from another paper (NY Times vs CNN). I checked for the same link before I posted but didn't check for other similar links. My bad. 
 




 Yes it does, but it didn't here. Some people who check the LosAngeles sub reddit may not have visited the other sub reddits that contain this link.  




 Please and fucking don't go together. It's one or the other.

 I know, the name is misleading.  They are actually a fairly reputable and unbiased source of information. Their reporters have been awarded 7 Pulitzer Prizes over the years and they are known "for avoiding sensationalism, producing a "distinctive brand of nonhysterical journalism". 




 Normally I wouldn't post this, but the WSJ is generally accurate with Apple rumors. 




 I like his delivery style.  Like a big kid who can't quite contain his excitement. 




 Yeah, not much of a surprise. 




 Yes, we're buying them.

It's confusing because you'd think that you should use the apostrophe for the possessive, but in the case of "it" you shouldn't.  The apostrophe is reserved for the contraction of it is. 




 Check out the D8 interview. My wife attended and during the Q A at 1:26:35 she asked Jobs a good question about DHCP. 
 




 Good answer - thanks. 




 That would make much more sense. 




 That was a request, not a demand. 




 Camera settings were: 200 mm, f/40 1.6 sec, ISO 6400.  I used three layers of 5% visible light transmission window tinting film.  I think that means there was only 0.05 * 0.05 * 0.05 = 0.000125 (0.0125%) transmission.  That would explain why I needed such a high ISO setting and exposure time. 




 The Milky Way looks WAY to small relative to the Earth. 




 Come on people, the clue that he WASN'T talking about L.A. was the term "Midwest".  How often do you hear people refer of the Midwest area of L.A.? 




 Western Canada is in the path of the partial eclipse so at least you get to see something (see animation above). 




 Interesting.  I've tried this with other color balloons and red seems to work best.  Some other colors don't pop at all.  That would imply red absorbs this laser light better than other colors. 




 Electronista has more info on this http://www.electronista.com/articles/12/05/11/domestic.shipments.ups.fedex.unaffected/.  You could be referring to this statement in the article:

"Other countries have less stringent rules allowing cellphone, iPod, and Kindle batteries to be shipped to other countries, yet prohibiting laptop batteries with their larger weight and higher amp-hour ratings." 




 UPDATE: RIM Australia issued a statement this morning May 1 9:20 AM AEST, with Richelle Gillett, Account Director from Spectrum Communications for Blackberry confirming:

We can confirm that the Australian Wake Up campaign, which involves a series of experiential activities taking place across Sydney and Melbourne, was created by RIM Australia. A reveal will take place on May 7th that will aim to provoke conversation on what being in business means to Australians. 




 My wife noticed it while we were catching up on season 6.  She had just interviewed Robert and he showed us the products he's invented.  I wouldn't be surprised if there are other TV commercials of his products on Dexter episodes. 




 Good point, I should've posted that.  Robert was very careful about spoilers. 




 She clearly is a non technical person who should not attempt to convey technical concepts. 




 They have to shut down the LHC every winter because its high energy requirements are not compatible with the sourrounding population's higher energy needs during the winter (i.e. not enough power to do both). 




 Some people don't like Physorg in general. 




 Gotta be an April fools thing.

 Freaking weirdest funeral procession I have ever seen, probably due to North Korean editing. Commentators are over the top with emotion. The background moaning is a bit much and clearly looped. 




 yep 




 The light source in the middle of the Einstein ring is a luminous red galaxy (LRG) as stated in the text, not just a single star.  It looks like a star since it's so far away and all of the stars in the galaxy appear to be collapsed to a single blob. Sniperchild is correct that the galaxy has a black hole in the middle, as almost all galaxies do.   




 ditto 




 A single atom does not have sufficient density to form a black hole because an atom is mostly empty space - very small nucleus surrounded by a relatively large cloud of light electrons. You have to get rid of the electron cloud and compress the nuclei of multiple atoms to get a sufficiently high density. 




 The point of the article is that a mass of 3x the sun is sufficient, but just barely, to form a black hole.  This does not mean that all stars with a mass of 3x that of our sun are or become black holes.  It requires special conditions for a black hole of such a low mass to develop from gravitational collapse of a star.  Also, black holes with a mass much less than our sun are postulated to exist.  These primordial black holes do not form from the gravitational collapse of a star but are remnants from the big bang.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole 




 These are pretty cool, but Day 25 with the dual deer heads looks like a law suit waiting to happen.

Two car thieves led Los Angeles police on a bizarre high speed chase that at times was reminiscent of the Keystone Cops. The driver was literally driving in circles around the pursuing cruisers, which made for an entertaining chase at times. (1998)

 Favorite line: "Where's the bar?" 




 You mean about his Myspace reference? 




 One word: Cajones! 




 Not clear why he would need to be arrested for the investigation, unless he isn't cooperating with the authorities. 




 I believe Vegas is starting to take bets on this one. You could really score big time with this precise knowledge! 




 Well stated.  

I'm convinced that in addition to science   technology influencing scifi, the converse is true as well.  I'd like to think people who make decisions that affect society in significant ways are influenced by the type of messages Star Trek delivers.  But even if not, positive change can come in small ways by people like us. 




 Yeah, I noticed that.  I think his/her thought was in the right place even if the words were not. 




 I hear you. 




 And the white one is still to be released. 




 Had to be said. 




 It's the Lady Gaga iPhone edition. 




 Agreed, and is that a button I see in the upper right? 




 Yes he is - no fluff on what he says. 




 Oh, that's a softball.  Batter up!... 




 Found the resolution  - only 500 x 500.  You can get an enlarged version at 665 x 665 but still poor.   




 Still looking for it.  Will post when I can find it. 




 You're right - we know of no planets within a 100 light years that could support life capable of receiving our broadcasts.

However, SETI isn't about someone else receiving our broadcasts - it's about us receiving someone else's broadcasts.  If some day they are received, those transmissions will likely have been traveling much longer than 100 years. 




 I see that it has been posted elsewhere in reddit, but I don't see it repeated in TechNewsToday.  Did I miss another post? 




 Reminds me of how M-theory is described, but in only 2 dimensions rather than 11. 




 Why would anyone want to do this? 




 We just celebrate ours a bit later

 I think they have a long way to go. 




 "... will make its five-year home in the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point ..."  Isn't that where Webb is supposed to park?  Hope they coordinate their parking spots. 




 Sorry about that.  I think that's a limitation of the html5 player. You can download the episode but maybe more of a hassle than it's worth.

 Yep, one of the options they list.

That's like having the Alien pop out of your chest and survive! 




 Wikipedia says 23 million light years, so yes this old news ... just new to us. 




 Given that supernova occurred 23 million light years away, that's pretty bright.

 That umbrella would be toast if it were a real lightning strike, but it seems to be intact. 




 Tell him to imagine himself poised precariously on a ledge 20 stories above the street. Then tell him he has the potential to release a lot of energy by simply jumping and plummeting to his death. Lots of blood, broken bones and a high probability of losing his life. Where did it all come from? Potential energy that was turned into kinetic energy then impact. Then  ask if he believes in potential energy. 




 Yes, the Very Long Baseline Array is impressive, but it is an interferometer with lots of spatial ambiguity.  This array would yield more of a focused main beam with very low sidelobes.  That is one of the reasons the individual arrays are somewhat randomly rather than periodically placed.  

The toy comparison was a bit charged.  I am completely enthralled by the LHC and can't wait for full power operation.  I was only indicating it is small in size compared to this array. 




 That's like saying "The pixel on a CCD would fit comfortably in this period."  But that's not the entire sensor.  Sure the central region would fit in the LHC, but the entire collection of arrays spans over 3000 km (see the end of the video).  The LHC at about 9 km in diameter is tiny compared to the entire array.  This array would derive its very fine spatial resolution from its large dimension.  That is what makes it impressive, not the central region by itself.  

Admittedly, this array may never be built.  But the scope would be impressive and the performance unprecedented if it were. 




 Our Sun is quite a dynamic star. 




 Yeah, that's annoying.  SAI seems to enjoy spreading these things over many pages, probably to get more hits. 




 Yes, but in addition the odd shaped earth shows the strength of gravity varying around the globe with the yellow and red areas being the strongest and the blue areas being the weakest.  




 ... and it happens to be April 1st in Europe.
