 I like the line of "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." This is what is going on in Ukraine right now with Chechnyan fighters helping Ukrainian forces put down the Russian rebels. The same with Syria in which many Free Syrian Army fighters having defected to groups such as ISIS because they hate Bashar al-Assad more than they hate ISIS. It makes war very messy, especially once the conflict is over the temporarily united factions under a common enemy might then fight it out after their common enemy falls.  




  Then my brother's alcoholic girlfriend drank it one night. Doesn't even remember it, just wanted more stuff to get her drunk. I will never forgive her.

When someone is stealing other people's booze to get drunk that means that there is a very serious problem. Is she and your brother still together or did he move on?

 If anyone is curious about the reference, this is referring to Emma Sulkowicz a.k.a. Mattress girl. She carried around her mattress as a publicity stunt even though it was shown that she lied about being raped. She made a crazy website where she films herself simulating rape and tells anyone that watches the video that they have committed stare rape if they don't agree with her. She is a nut case that harms not only the people she falsely accused, but real rape victims. When websites like Gawker and Jezebel picked her up as some sort of feminist hero, that is when I stopped reading those sites and I finally realized how terrible they have become.  




 It is sad but true, taxpayer like you and I who are responsible will be stuck footing the bill for her irresponsibility. -_- 
























 You seem like a vindictive person if you are doing this partially out of spite. I am a little bit disappointed in you that you decided to play on that angle in your submission.  









 Can fathers also get this or does this only apply to mothers? It would only be fair for fathers to get the same treatment.  














 It would be even slower, what you have is the purgatory model. 56k modems are for heck, 28k modems are for hell.
