 equals one of my balls being the size of a clementine  




 Thanks for the figurative slap in the face you are right but emotions are powerful things 




 Think I'm gonna retaliate with doxycyclin and learning from this experience sorry to disappoint you 




 This seems to be the general consensus of the thread and I would like to thank all of you for not letting my emotions get the better of me 




 Drunk plus how good sex feels without a condom equals I'm a dumbass 




 I let my emotions get the better of me cause I'm fucking pissed off. Everyone in this thread is right doing anything to him is childish and not going to change anything in the long run 




 Then I find out I'm a horrible judge of character and lose faith in humanity 




 A little fucking callous but you make good points. 




 You could be completely right but I'm usually a very untrusting person because I have had the shit manipulated out of me before. She has proven herself to me thus far but of course she could just be a manipulative bitch and be incredibly good about it. If i find out that's true goddamn I don't know if I could trust anyone ever again. 




 Like I said i trust her a lot and I'm usually a very cynical person. You could definitely be right but I think I'm a good judging people and she has proven herself to me though. But everyone in this thread saying to be the better man are correct. I'm letting my emotions get the better of me. 




 She figured out he was cheating on her about a week after she had gotten an STD test and was clean. She dumped him immediately afterwards and we met about month later. I now have chlamydia and epididymitis because of an admittedly lapse in judgement on my part(bareback).

Her last boyfriend was obviously a huge piece of shit. I trust her story 100% because she got an IUD and had to get tested before that. I had also gotten tested recently and the only girl I have fucked since then is her. I am 99.9999% sure that I am the only guy she has fucked since the breakup, we have a very open and trusting relationship.

I just found out about the STD so obviously emotions are running pretty high. He not only cheated on this girl that I care for a lot but also gave us both chlamydia. What would you do in this situation reddit?

**EDIT**: One of the first times reddit has actually been productive for me instead of counterproductive. Y'all are right I am letting my emotions getting the better of me and this is mostly my fault

 I suggest watch the documentary When you're strange. It's narrated by Johnny Depp and tell the story of the Doors in a very entertaining way. Although I guess you'd have to fuck up hard to make something about Jim Morrison's life not entertaining.

If you like that read the biography No One Here Gets Out Alive

 Let's face it, this school is fucking hard... especially when professors refuse to give out practice tests or only give out one(*cough* physics department *cough*). I think it would benefit everyone if we put together a r/gatech word server where anyone could upload materials from classes they previously took(like a fraternity or sorority word). I could probably set something up if there's any interest... 




 Oh all the time. One time a few friends and I were tripping on acid and we decided to throw milkdrop up on one of the projectors. Got a few weird looks from the kids trying to study(fucking nerds) but it was a great experience 




 I don't think reddit would benefit from people ignoring this so much as not misinterpreting it. It's not saying plagiarize and copy, it's saying take things that speak to you from various sources and make them your own.

 For some reason, my hands and feet sweat excessively at all times. Even as I'm typing this now, I can feel the grimy, clammy sweat building up on my hands and it's really uncomfortable. This always makes handshakes pretty awkward, I definitely would be pretty grossed out if I shook someone's hand only to find it wet with sweat. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Of course I know the ol' wipe your hands on your pants trick, but that just doesn't quite cut it for me any more...

I can do a decent posh accent(or so I've been told by actual british people) and I've thought about just one day starting to talk in a british accent and never stopping. Sure I'd loose all my friends probably but eventually I could make new friends who wouldn't know I'm actually american. I'd get so many more chicks that way it'd be awesome 




 Hmmm, how about saying it was an interesting movie made me think about things I never would have thought about before? Does that make me sound stupid?
 









 Jim Morrison for sure 




 Yeah, he has a ton of really mind blowing videos. My favorite is where he somehow subconsciously convinces like 30 mall goers to raise their hands in the air at the same time with just a few announcements over the loudspeaker.

Honestly, I can't help but be skeptical that he didn't stage some of his videos but everything I've watched paints him as a honest down to earth guy who wouldn't stage things just to increase his ratings.

Here's the video if anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOEKdaXIEHc

 Get outside man. Go hiking or something. Go look at nature and try to comprehend the trillions of complex organic reactions that are occurring right before your eyes.

 Wow I never knew how much of an asshole Edison was. Electrocuting an elephant in front of a crowd of people proves nothing and I'm sure he knew that, its just the general public didn't have much of an understanding of electricity at the time.

 I don't get this viewpoint at all. Technology has progressed enough so that things like instant replay can be used in soccer. Sure coming up with rules so that this could be implemented without drastically changing the game play will take a bit of thought but I believe it is possible. 

In this world cup, in almost every single game I've watched, the refs have made at least one bad call that would have been overturned by an instant replay. Why would you resist trying to make the game more fair? That goal England scored yesterday would have drastically changed the game. The disputed goal this article talks about would have drastically changed the game. 

Change is a good thing if it's done right.

 I took a 4000 level intro to neuroscience class last semester and it blew my mind. What defines 'you', your personality, inhibitions, vocabulary and memory is in fact tangible and malleable.

 Yeah mental illness scares the fuck out of me, I read a story here from a paramedic send to a girls house by her mother because she was having an episode again.

He walked into the house and found the girl sitting by herself in the living room. Apparently as he walked in she stared at him for about 30 seconds and that stood up completely inhuman way that he said looked like something a human could never do. She then said something along the lines of I am the devil incarnate. She then held her hand up in way it seemed like she was holding something and said to him I Hold here the key to enter the gates of hell and walked up to him.
He has absolutely no belief in the supernatural and he still said it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to him and it still freaks him the fuck out to this day. 




 So say the main character of this game is a paranoid schizophrenic. For example maybe he is the only person in this world to have telekinesis or something along these lines and despite his mental illness he has to overcome it to save the world. You would have to deal with that, all along dealing with things like hearing voices, hallucinations and other paranoid schizophrenic presents. You wouldn't be able to tell what was real and what wasn't although maybe there would be a subtle ability to recognize a pattern to get to the bottom of this. The game would be a total mind fuck but it would be really interesting to deal with problems and eye opening for people who don't know much about this disease 




 I think you should reread my post man. Dont think you fully understood it

 So recently I've been on a huge comedy kick and I'm looking for more shows to keep this bender going. I love seinfeld and curb, WLIIA, scrubs, seasons 2-12 of the Simpsons, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Metalocalypse, squidbillies, superjail, venture bros, and a ton more there's no need to list. As you can see my tastes are really diverse and I'm open to anything, recommend me a hilarious new show and you won't regret it. 

I also love british humor  




 Would that entertain you for eternity though or would you eventually get tired of it? I remember in the movie trainspotting they described the the feeling of shooting up heroin as far better than any orgasm you will ever have. This would be the exact same thing everyday and it just makes me wonder would you eventually get bored of pure bliss? 




 I always thought if I was groundhog dayed I would try a bunch of crazy drugs I would never try otherwise. I specifically thought of H, I've dabbled in opiates, even took OCs a couple times but never tried heroin. But in your predicament, you might as well make the best of it.


There are no downsides, you can't OD, you can't build up a tolerance, no money worries, etc. So I was wondering from people who have tried this, would doing heroin all day everyday make you feel good enough that you wouldn't mind being stuck in one day over and over again for an unimaginable amount of time? I think the writers of groundhog day said Bill Murray spent about 9000 years in his day. 


Of course psychedelics would be really fucking interesting too and many other drugs would be a lot of fun but I have a feeling that it'd be kinda hard to find those in Puxatony.

 I'll do my best to explain a 4D cube(hypercube). First we'll relate the 2nd and 3rd dimensions because it is much easier to comprehend. We begin with a 2D square, this is simple enough it exists in only the x and y planes. To get a 3D cube from a square, we draw another square with the same x and y coordinates but change the z coordinate. Now you have two squares, one above the other, and you can simply connect all the vertices to form a cube.

A cube exists in the x, y and z planes which intersect at 90 degree angles with each other. To get to the fourth dimension we need to add another plane which still intersects with the x, y and z plane at a 90 degree angle. I personally can't imagine what this looks like, I'm not sure if it's even possible for us to comprehend it, but mathematically it is possible. Lets call this fourth dimension w for simplicity's sake. A hypercube is simply two cubes with the same x, y and z coordinates, separated in the w direction, and connected at the vertices. Mathematically simple to describe, but a bitch to imagine.  




 I think common sense predicts that 




 It would probably be well before that actually... 




 DUH 




 Yeah I've thought about what a 4D object would be like quite a bit. The 4th dimension would be a direction that is perpendicular to the up and down, left and right, and away and towards directions(x, y, and z). A 4D creature observing us would be able to see all sides of us along with everything inside of us all at once. 

If, say a 4D sphere were to pass through our world, to us it would look like a small sphere that appears out of nowhere and could even hang in midair, gradually gets bigger until it reaches a maximum size and then shrinks and disappears. The easiest way I've found to even kind of understand is to imagine us observing/interacting with a 2D world and kind extrapolate what it would be like to the interactions between a 4D world and a 3D world. 

Carl Sagan has a great video I'm sure you can find on youtube where he explains the 4th dimensions with the poetic yet scientific style he was famous for.  




 I always thought those were called hyper-cubes... but yeah thats four spacial dimensions. I have no idea what the fuck three time demensions would be like.

One spacial dimension is easy enough to imagine however but it's hard to even think of time as a dimension, how the hell can you have 3D time? Such a mind fuck  




 Here's what NASA has to say about it. Still not much explaination though

http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/science_faq.html#36 




 One of the reasons I posted this is I was hoping someone could explain it. Although I doubt it's possible for our brains to comprehend three time dimensions, it's hard enough trying to imagine a fourth spacial dimension. 




 Yeah I know right, I definitely can comprehend this it's so simple and intuitive!

 One good topic is how good at parallel parking I am. Always a great conversation starter 




 I'm about to be 23 years old and I've been depressed since about 14 or 15. At first I really had no reason to be depressed, I had a good group of friends, was part of the "popular" crowd, like that matters. I think what really kicked it off for me was getting pretty bad acne for most of high school. It hurt my self esteem and I don't think I've ever really recovered.

I am seeing a psychiatrist and am on lexapro and klonopin for anxiety. The depression is really just killing my work ethic which mean I'm struggling in school and lately I feel I've been even withdrawing from my friends here in college. I dread being awake and sleep way too much. Here is a little something I wrote while I was feeling really bad that I think outlines how I feel every day.



Suddenly, unexpectedly consciousness returned with a forceful jolt. Whatever he was dreaming, it was long gone to him now, it shattered like a glass dropping from a great height. He could feel a cold sweat encasing his body and threw off the blankets. It all quickly came back to him and, just like every morning, he wished it hadnt. The inanity, the despondence, the overwhelming feeling of dread accompanying each day, he could not imagine life without it. His only solace was that he could feel himself becoming more and more numb to it each morning. Maybe someday he would wake up and it wouldnt bother him anymore, maybe someday this would become normal for him, but today was not that day.

I was just wondering if you could give me any advice on how to get out of this tailspin. The only time I'm happy is when I am seeing a girl and I have been broken up with twice probably due to my depression. I just want to feel motivated and normal again.

No idea why I like it and it disgusts me in real life or if its real but I guess it's the whole domination/power thing. When im having sex with I'll get into dirty talk a bit like "you've been such a naughty girl" etc... Wow that sounds fucking lame typed out but I think the whole exchange is fairly normal. I may be just jaded by porn so someone please let me know if this is odd or I am fucked up freak.

 I agree the fact that he grouped both acid and ecstasy with meth just makes absolutely no sense... I probably thought similarly when I was like 16 but that was 7 years and a few trips ago.

Don't get me wrong they're not healthy for you by any means, ecstasy more so than acid, but they're definitely not meth. 




 Sounds like you really don't know much about drugs at all. Anyone who has any sense would tell you coke is a much worse drug than acid... care to explain your reasoning? 




 I agree about time for me to take off if you know what I mean ;)

 Get better friends 




 Congratulations! I can't really relate, I've been blessed with a really fast metabolism but I'm sure that will slow down as I get older(only 22 now). 

Right now, I can basically eat anything I want, be completely sedentary and not gain any weight whatsoever. Add the fact that unless I'm eating one of the few foods I absolutely love, I see eating more as an inconvenience than anything and you get my 6' 135 lbs self. 

Opposite ends of the spectrum I guess, I can definitely feel the physical effects of being slightly underweight but I still consider myself very lucky.

PS you speak English better than half of the native speakers here.
 









 Well yeah, I wouldn't say it to someone I just met or am just acquaintances with but with my girlfriend or other girls I'm decent friends with I am sure I'm not offending anyone. Maybe it's just my personality but it's very obvious I'm joking as I'm usually a very nice and pleasant person.
