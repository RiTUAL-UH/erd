 There's also a nice set of photos and an interview with the author [here](http://www.theworld.org/2011/11/ants-art-of-war/). 




 If I had to guess, I'd say it ushered in the militarization of the United States. 




 "Maps of Time: an Introduction to Big History" by David Christian is a wonderful book that doesn't focus on any one region and spans from the big bang to 2002. Big History is interested in the history of the world as a whole and Christian points out some surprising trends. 




 For a lie to be believed it must be very big and repeatedly told. 




 The Standard Oil octopus has always been my favorite. 




 Name calling is the last bastion of someone who can't hold up their end of the argument. As for pretending I know what's going on in relation to American history, I fooled two universities into giving me degrees that say just that. Let's see how much you know about this period. I'll ask a simple question that any of my students can answer: What do historians call the period that stretches from 1890-1920s? Extra points if you can name two activists during this time. 




 "Your use of a 1904 poster shows the problem with your analysis. Social darwinism, by definition, requires that there be competition on equal grounds amongst people. In 1904, after slavery had been abolished, there was competition."

Darwinism does require competition, however it's not on equal grounds. White slave owners considered their slaves as inferior, and no better than animals. I'm also not going to argue this point any further in that you don't understand your own nation's history. As for Ron Paul, I could care less about the man or his politics. He is a libertarian, a group that was popular during the early 1900s, and its influence paved the way for the later economic melt down that began in the 1920s, leading to the Great Depression. Libertarians are simply political Luddites. 




 The article's author states each myth and then proceeds to explain why they're true. It makes no sense to me why the author calls them myths.
1. Hoover was gay. Author - Whatever he did behind closed doors are his business.
2. Not a coward - didn't join in WWI because of family responsibilities.
ETC. 




 He may or may not be a social darwinist in re race. I honestly don't know and certainly don't know what you think social darwinism has to do with slavery.

Social Darwinism played a huge part in slavery, and continued to be used as an excuse by American politicians in both the north and the south to enforce Jim Crow laws and the "separate-but-equal-philosophy." For example, [here](http://i.imgur.com/38K02.jpg) is a poster from the 1904 St. Louis Expo that lists the Races of Man according to the Social Darwin scale. Many historians argue that the U.S. Government's [reason](http://i.imgur.com/2PPyj.jpg) for occupying the Philippines and Cuba was to protect its backward citizens from cruel Spain.  




 I attended San Diego State University for graduate school, but looked into attending a Cal school (UCSD) and it was far too expensive. Maybe it's because I'm just not as wealthy as I should be at my age. 




 No sensationalism here. I'm just asking whether you believe that the same contemporary Republican leadership that has purposely hobbled the economy in order to to win back the White House, would risk their political careers to free the slaves? 




 This event just might be the tipping point that leads the FBI to investigate California's police state. You see, those kids go to Berkeley, and their parents have money. Do you think some Berkeley students' parents are now very upset? 




 Discovery channel did a good show on whether racist symbols are hidden within the sculpture and surrounding tunnels. 




 Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity. 




 Honey, the last thing I want to do is hurt you. But it's still on the list. 




 Today is the anniversary of my father's death. I want to die peacefully in my sleep, as he did, not screaming in terror like the passengers in his car. 




 When I think of socially cashing-in Facebook whoring immediately jumps to mind. The people in these photos have actually gotten off the couch and are practicing real democracy. Not to sound too harsh. 




 To really take back our democracy we must place term limits on representatives from both houses. Politicians and diapers, they should both be changed regularly and for the same reasons. 




 My dad grew up during the 40's in the mountains of Asheville. Judging from the little he tells me about his childhood, the area is remote, religious, and hostile to outsiders. 




 Banksy? Is that you? 




 Readers of Cracked, or perhaps on crack. 




 My personal favorite is Old Boy. 




 There is a single page option on the landing page. I'm not too keen on posting content that requires multiple clicks because I understand the Reddit hive-mind doesn't like them.

Edit: It's labeled "view all." 




 From the survey - "Do you think the views of people involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement generally reflect the views of most Americans?" Yes - 46% 




 The idea of Germany going to war sends shivers up my back. I want to say it's a country with a penchant for war, but then I look at the US and realize we're no better. 




 On the flip side, OWS has a 46% approval rating. 




 I see the move as a positive; it will give the students a familiarity with the kinds of jobs they'll be assuming after leaving college. Now that's really getting a college education. 




 Wow...there might be some substance to this idea. Does Goldman Sachs stand to make a boat-load of money? 




 My sentiments exactly - tell a lie long enough and loud enough and it will eventually be believed. I wonder if Sun Power will come out swinging in response to the negative Fox campaign. 




 Not for younger readers in deed. I'm still scarred by Dr. Seuss's book "Horton Hears a Who, and He Better Not Be a Fucking Snitch". 




 The mere idea that if a person needs public assistant they must be on drugs is deeply offensive. The wealthy are in a far greater position to indulge in a chemical holiday. 




 So your okay with the idea of drug testing someone before they can receive a pittance from the government; you must have been inconsolable when the government gave away 750 billion without asking for one single drug test. I'd say they're both forms of government assistance, but one form is actually reaching the people it can help. 




 It is the truth in those words that gives it humor. I heard a comedian once say that all humor was rooted in truth. 




 Hmmm...just waiting for an alum to comment that the address is actually a form of class warfare. 




 South Park - it's a shitty wall (city wall) made by the chinese character who owns a shitty wok (city wok restaurant). Stay out of chinese restaurants in South Park or you might get shot in the balls. 




 [YES]...the politics subreddit has seemed more lucid since the ban went into place. 




 If you do drop acid, may I suggest the lobby of the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas as the location. Just trying to walk across the hotel lobby's carpet while tripping is an adventure in itself. 




 It also breaks the third wall by acknowledging the day-to-day Hollywood routine in the final scenes of the movie. 




 "Get your dirty-dick-beaters off of me!!" 




 I've seen the General quoted in other books, which stressed his stance on foreign involvement by U.S. forces. 




 Readability is a good one for firefox.

But, really, this is the thought that went through my head as I read the post.

"Hello sir/ma'am. I can tell from your post that you're a busy person, and the effort to push a button can seem daunting at times. Could I, perhaps, interest you in a subscription to Readers Digest?"

"Blah, blah, blah, insert lame excuse here."

"I know, I know, even that seems like too much trouble. Might I suggest that you tune into Fox or MSNBC News, there you won't be required to read, or even to think. They'll tell you just what to be angry about and how angry you should be." 




 If I want to make them laugh - "Blazing Saddles".

For the more serious side - "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". 




 This storm system is HUGE!!! 




 So RobotRollCall is incorrect? The way I understand light's property in relation to the universe: Looking at a star is like looking into the past; the light from the star that I'm seeing on Earth happened 150 years earlier - or 150 light years away. So if we see IK Pegasi B's super nova today, it actually took place 150 years earlier. Is this right? 




 I'm researching anomalies for a fiction book. I like my writing to be as accurate as possible.  




 I wasn't sure if time and the speed of light could be different measurements. This means that if a GRB event occurred, civilization would have a hundred fifty years to prepare? 




 I think O'Reilly thought he booked a couple of "yes" men and they didn't play along. I don't like Stein but he did hold O'Reilly's view in check. 




 I'm SO DISAPPOINTED that I didn't make the list. Yet. 




 That would make a great Saturday Night Live skit. You should email the idea to the show. 




 or perhaps to shape the conversation. But then again, aren't we all? 




 No class warfare here. I just looked at your overview and it's a relatively new account with a minimum of submitted links. For an experienced redditor, an account such as yours screams right-wing troll. 




 After looking through your Reddit overview I'm going to take your opinions with a grain of salt. I also believe your user name is associated with the patrician side of the U.S. political/economic system. 




 This cartoon is a snapshot of the political process. I think therefore I don't think. 




 Ooooohhhh...that almost sounds like a challenge. I'm with you on the couch-politician moniker. I believe sharing ideas on reddit has some value. 




 I'm considering taking a bullhorn to some of the political rallies and yelling "doublethink" when the pol starts slinging the bullshit. 




 You're going to have to elaborate on your point because at present it sounds like you're passing the buck. Who ultimately has the responsibility for generating "doublethink"? 




 I thought this would be about Arrested Development. 




 Okay...I watched this film and it's a very simplistic explanation for a very complicated system. It doesn't take into account political, social, or economic climate. If you live in a zoo this video might mean something. 




 Thank you, the link is very helpful. 




 Ender does learn a combat art but the author doesn't say how. He even laments not learning advanced combat arts before his fight in the shower.
The military base is a very large population within a captured former bugger tunnel complex.
There were at least eight previous commander trainees who washed out before Ender completed the final test. The commander who teaches Ender admits this during his instruction. 




 A good article that deserves a deeper contemplation. 




 "This is about exposing the corrupt power relationship between Wall Street and the government. Corporations have way too much influence, and this occupation is about fighting against it, taking a stand on principle, and exposing corruption."

I believe most Americans recognize the relationship between Wall Street and government. What I also believe is that this protest will warn both parties that Americans are now angry enough about the BS to nonviolently protest. 




 I just posted this to see if it would get downvoted. I'm pleased to see that Palin is losing her popularity, even as a divisive figure. 




 I'm at a loss for words at how desperate poor people can be. Guess the other country that has a high portion of the young unemployed. With the new social media devices available to the masses, flash mobs may become the norm for the dispossessed and powerless. Where are the young peoples' parents? Working two jobs so that they can exist day-to-day. If the poor cannot reach the wealthy (gates, dogs, fences) then they'll vent their rage on the more accessible middle class. I'm not advocating for violence or looting, but I do understand the underlying anger that's driving these actions. 




 I'm more interested in Bain Capital's [lobbying](http://buchaada.imgur.com/bain_capital#l5RQI) with another lobbying group [Public Strategies Washington](http://buchaada.imgur.com/bain_capital#wWam2)and [who](http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=F07 year=2011) it's associated with in the lobbying process. 




 Fox doesn't report on the news, it just gives commentary. Delicious, divisive, skewed, and spun, it delivers opinions that are no good for anyone. 




 From all that I've seen the corporate-political hegemony isn't really keeping things bearable for the middle class. 




 Just as Americans are [losing faith in their own government](http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/08/05/what-happens-when-citizens-lose-faith-in-government/) corporations move on to its next victims. 




 But what if that lightning is the product of two leprechauns playing hide the sausage? 




 I'm going to suggest one book for you, but it is a very long book. "Maps of Time: an introduction to big history" by David Christian is a book that documents the history of earth from its inception to the 2000s. I recommend this book because it discusses patterns and cycles that are hidden unless the individual views the big picture. It is a peer-reviewed book by a noted and well-respected historian that places mankind in context to the planet. We humans seem to believe that manipulating our environment comes with no consequences. Much like Carl Sagan described the Earth in relation to the cosmos, Christian performs the same service for our planet and species. As any planetary scientist could tell you, we are a small speck on an inconsequential planet that sits on a back-water portion of a spiral in the Milky Way. We are nothing in cosmic terms and if humans were to disappear do you believe the cosmos would notice?  




 I'm no Luddite and love technology as much as the next person, however, I'm also a realist. In geological terms, Homo sapiens have only spent an eye blink on this planet. During this short period we are responsible for an extinction level event that is on par with the loss of the dinosaurs. You won't have to decide on who lives/dies during the great die off, nature will do that. I hear people say, "We must save the planet, we're killing it." This planet will be just fine; it will bounce back and continue to spin. It's the people that really have to worry.  




 For the working poor the sky is falling. I can only hope you're not the sort of person who looks up at the sky with an open mouth; unless, of course, you're one of the wealthy, in which case I kind of hope you drown. 




 Your post is basically saying, "Fight the man, but be sure to look like him." Part of this protest is rooted in a social realm and asking for anyone to curtail his/her own individuality is a direct assault on diversity. 




 Because you need evidence of the government's involvement in creating and punishing race related crimes, I'm giving a nice list of books to help you along. If you're still confused about government or corporate responsibility in creating a police state dependent on racial profiling after reading this list, then there really isn't much hope that you'll ever understand the problem.

 No, I won't stop it. That is the problem with the U.S.; too many people are willing to lay down and let shit happen to them. We are in the middle of a culture war with the nation's wealthy who base their opinions on appearance. The right car, college, diction, and associations all play into this paradigm. The reason no one is getting hired today is because there are no jobs. The wealthy have gutted the labor unions leaving very few institutions powerful enough to represent the poor. The latest budget fight is a glaring example of the lengths politicians are willing to go to protect the wealthy. Instead of stopping, you should be getting angry. 




 Meanwhile, over on [digg](http://socialhype.com/offbeat/10-of-the-funniest-barack-obama-pictures-ever-3/). 




 I'm with you on this one Patrick; I'd love to know what kind of vehicle those being attacked were driving. Imagine these kids living in poverty but having to watch people have fun at a fair the AA can't afford to attend. The AA's decide to protest and look for victims driving late model BMWs, Mercedes, SUVs, Audis, or Lincolns. This is only the start of the violence; if an individual appears to have wealth they become a target. 




 Let me just be clear here, no one should be allowed to steal a family driveway critically needed to transport a disabled child. 




 I'm betting that the drop continues. In fact, I hope the drop continues. Why? Because I'm poor, underemployed ($6000 ytd), and miserable. I could say misery enjoys company but that's not why I want the stocks to drop. In my opinion, the political and economic system in the U.S. needs fixing and the only way that will happen is if enough middle-class people REALLY feel the financial pain a large proportion of Americans already experience. I welcome these numbers because they're another step in that direction. 




 Ahhh, but can you bend over at the waist and still spell RUN. This is supposed to be impossible; try it with a friend.

Edit: I should also warn that this is incredibly difficult for females to accomplish. 




 upvoted for wit, then. 




 Can you clarify your point for me? I'm confused with whether I should be righteously pissed or admiring your tongue-in-cheek wit. 




 Many times the original submission has been submitted to an inappropriate subreddit. Since you subsist on submission karma, you should substitute the original submission, and subject it to the correct subreddit. I understand you feel subjugated by a subordinate redditor, but I hope my sublime advice will launch your reddit karma into the suborbital karmasphere. 




 [Reddit](http://www.alternet.org/story/151850/8_reasons_young_americans_dont_fight_back_how_the_us_crushed_youth_resistance?page=entire) is [teeming](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/09/20/903538/-Huge-voter-suppression-plot-exposed-in-Wisconsin) with posts on the efforts to sway the U.S. political system. As a young man, I didn't care about politics. It took a graduate degree in American history to wake me up to the reality of a professional-run political system with a revolving door leading straight to the open arms of big business. 




 I'm with socks on his critique of your comment. It is an ad hominem argument likely to draw upvotes from like-minded individuals. It adds nothing to the argument and inspires a knee-jerk response. Now, were you to produce a response such as that of SpeedSteamBoat, posted below, and include your critical comments, I would find that much more productive. Instead, your comment is on the same level as the original poster's lede, thus mirroring an action that you supposedly despise. 




 Edison was the king of stealing other's ideas and making them his own. He was the modern-day equivalent of Dane Cook or Carlos Mensia. By the way, do a search of "fake mexican comedian" on Google and check out the number one spot. 




 Point 3 is especially important because it explains children's initial introduction to authority. Michel Foucault spoke about the close association between prisons and the school system in his book ["Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison".](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish) He argued that children are taught from a very young age to line up, sit, answer bells, and be watched over by an authority figure. I believe this is the very first step in teaching our population to submit. 




 How is that any different from the U.S. Tea Party's objective? 




 We have a political system in the U.S. that's deeply wedded to the nations corporate moneyed elite. Until we find a way to divorce the two systems out nation will continue to decline. [Joshua Holland](http://www.alternet.org/economy/151705/why_the_wealthiest_americans_are_the_real_%27job-killers%27) discusses the myth between wealth and job creation, and he found no correlation. 




 How have I not heard of this man? Thoreau would be proud. DeChristopher is just the first actor in what will soon be a flood of civil disobedience. 

"And after 150 years of making other people rich, West Virginia is almost dead last among the states in per capita income, education rates and life expectancy.  And its not an anomaly.  The areas with the richest fossil fuel resources, whether coal in West Virginia and Kentucky, or oil in Louisiana and Mississippi, are the areas with the lowest standards of living.  In part, this is a necessity of the industry.  The only way to convince someone to blow up their backyard or poison their water is to make sure they are so desperate that they have no other option."

This statement is dead on, but the poor are close to their tipping point. When that point comes, no amount of government protection will stand in the way of civil disobedience. 




 I think he was confusing [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s51unxcyMVQ feature=player_detailpage) event with a Hitler Youth Rally. 




 IMHOP, the writer had a specific character in mind during the process; they would probably have the best opinion on the actor/actress who should play the part. 




 This opinion seems to be the consensus. 




 Apparently movie subredditors don't have a sense of humor (downvotes). It came out of nowhere. This, sir/ma'am, is funny. 




 The killer should be forced to read the victim's bios and look at their pictures. Religion and nationalism, two sides of the same coin. 




 Okay, that's just funny. 




 Juan Williams never mentioned Reddit by name. He could be talking about Delicious, Popurls, or Digg for all you know. Stop jumping to conclusions. 




 That is a matter of opinion. Words only have power if you give it to them. I myself prefer the term ["SuperPatriot"](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Parenti/Superpatriotism.html) because it describes the tea party's ideology much better. 




 "In the west, having kids isn't something you can just do without a thought. You need to pay for their education, and child labor laws and the like mean that kids are a money pit for the first 20 years of their lives."

You should probably qualify this statement by saying "in the west today." In the undeveloped western world, having a large number of babies was the norm. With a plethora of resources, many of the children survived but child mortality remained a big problem. Famine in Africa is not new. [This](http://imgur.com/uWcvp) photo won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Kevin Carter. [This](http://imgur.com/Zdeff) photo and [this](http://imgur.com/0MIna) are from the 1930s Dust Bowl area.

 Fred Astaire called this dance performance the greatest he'd ever seen. 




 I wouldn't say Reddit is pro-democrat because its users are a population that spans the globe. I would characterize the average Redditor as against any forms of unfairness. As the [Stiglitz](http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105?printable=true) post states, most politicians are part of the 1%, so democrat or republican, their political affiliation just doesn't seem to matter. 




 I miss San Diego and Comicon soooooo much. 




 Would the percentage values remain the same? I guestimated a 30% downvote margin. 




 "As we gaze out at the popular fervor in the streets, one question to ask ourselves is this: When will it come to America?"
"The top 1 percent rarely serve in the militarythe reality is that the all-volunteer army does not pay enough to attract their sons and daughters, and patriotism goes only so far."

When the violence comes, and it is coming, whose side do you think the military will be on? I don't condone violence, however, it may be the only way to make the 1% listen.

Even more disturbing, as I look at the story's trending numbers, 32% of Redditors downvoted this posting. WTF, Stiglitz offered a concise, well thought out, and intelligent argument and yet 336 redditors disagreed (1/3). 




 [This](http://files.g4tv.com/ImageDb3/269365_S/stool-sample.jpg) is the best way I know to take a stool sample. 




 I hope your wife buys the lube because lotion can be a massive irritant that I rely on as a last resort. 




 I'm proud to say that I'm already Murdoch free. 




 I'm down with that. 




 So you're saying she received a fair trial but she's still a "scumbag?" 




 I'm currently reading "Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military-Industrial Complex" by William Hartung, and he argues that the military is part of the problem. There is such competition among the different branches that they will continue to support a defense contractor's project even if it's a failure and a waste of taxpayer money. Hartung also credits Lockheed with developing the political strategy of "too big to fail." When congress threatened to pull MIC funding during the 70s because of the C-5A scandal, Lockheed said it would fail without a Bailout. The company claimed that financial failure and job losses within the aircraft production industry could cause a financial meltdown. 




 Like that little play on the word? I've developed this opinion after listening to Michael Parenti's talk on "the Superpatriot." 




 Upvote for superior word play. 




 The sad reality is that most Americans rely on Marxist terminology when discussing societal classes. The markers utilized to define class are malleable and subject to change as societies progress. 




 Working class: average male (adding a family [wife,2kids] places an even greater strain)
1. Lives paycheck-to-paycheck.
2. Cannot afford to put money in savings on a monthly basis.
3. One car still being paid on.
4. Rents house, apartment, trailer, condo (sometimes).
5. Can only occasionally go out to eat.
6. Heavily reliant on credit cards to get through the average month.
7. Employment is limited to low/moderate pay (30-40k). 




 I avoided Facebook because I like my privacy. 




 Not yet. 




 I don't think Americans think along class lines; Race is more the American cup of tea. 




 You need re-familiarize yourself with that linked piece. I'll give you a little help here: DoD tracks "representativeness" - as Gilroy calls it - very closely. And representativeness can take a whole host of forms - race, education, social status, income, region and so on. "When you look at all of those, you find that the force is really quite representative of the country," he said in a recent interview. "It mirrors the country in many of these. And where it doesn't mirror America, it exceeds America."

It mirrors the country, which is majority working class. The article alludes to education but that has no relation to class. 




 Now that your inhibitions are down, do you have any racy picks to share with your fellow redditors?

Edit: I'm such a pussy. Let me try that again. Show us your tits. 




 Did you get a picture. Without proof it's hearsay. 




 Really? Do you thinks all those upper-class/middle-class families are going to let their babies go to war. No, it's the working-class, only-way-I-can-afford-college families that watch their children go to war.  




 Of course, this got voted down immediately. 




 It's a show about tweekers. DO NOT KEEP TWEEKERS WAITING!!! 




 I'm with you on this one. I've said for years that the Legislative branch should only be allowed two terms, which is the same limit for the president. We now have congress people whose only goals are reelection, making money, and stepping into the revolving door of private industry. Remove the monetary incentive from the legislative process and the U.S. just might discover new leaders who want to improve their country instead of raping it.

Edit: [Here](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20075586-503544.html) is a little something to chew on. 




 Thank you for offering the community a very nice example of "keeping your outrage to comment sections" and demonstrating a sweeping generalization regarding "hard line hate mongering liberals." 




 Blue Beard - "The Great Depression was going on, so that the station and the streets teemed with homeless people, just as they do today. The newspapers were full of stories of worker layoffs and farm foreclosures and bank failures, just as they are today. All that has changed, in my opinion, is that, thanks to television, we can hide a Great Depression. We may even be hiding a Third World War." (p. 71-72)

"He suggested that we build a Money Hall of Fame out there, with busts of the arbitrageurs and hostile-takeover specialists and venture capitalists and investment bankers and golden handshakers and platinum parachutists in niches, with their statistics cut into stone -- how many millions they had stolen legally in how short a time." (p. 90) 




 Welcome to the reality of 90% of American workers. 




 Depends on your fantasy.

edit: Coincidently, I've been informed by friends that Depends is also the flavor of old lady p*****. 




 I'll miss this [guy](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm589597184/nm0000469) more. 




 Wait...what's this 'we' shit? I didn't vote for Bush the first time around, and I certainly didn't vote twice for that sad, sad piece-of-crap. 




 I reject your reality and substitute my own. 




 I'd rather have the ability to fully understand their conversation. 




 Yes, we all know how hard insurance companies have it these days. Instead of hugs, why not just deny a few claims? Your son needs a bone marrow transplant? Denied - gotta save the money to protect a wealthy person's porsche from flooding. Cancer treatment? Have you seen this porsche that's threatened by a flood? Stop whining about needing cancer treatments?  




 It's nice to see my wealthy friends being taken care of by the lower castes. This story warms my heart. If only the porsche in new orleans had been saved. Oh wait, its owner was not white. 




 For just a moment there I was confused with your [logic!](http://www.pbs.org/peoplelikeus/resources/stats.html), and then I checked out your past comments and decided not to waste my time. If you're comfortable with working-class wages remaining stagnant since 1972, while professional politicians vote themselves regular pay raises, then why ask you to pull your head out of A HOLE? 




 Shopped...so obvious. 




 Does anyone know why Web of Trust (WOT) has such a low ranking for this blog? 




 Can you imagine how they'd market to women? Anyone up for granny panties wrapped in an oven mitt?

 Your GF gives you the same card every year? I remember this meme coming around at about this time last year. At least take the meme to a new level by adding pictures. One for every year. And then it becomes its own meme. And on to evil infinity. 




 No! The original must have lacked a snappy headline, or was posted in the wrong subreddit. Now, stop whining and find me some content that's worth upvoting. Chop chop. 




 I "StumbledUpon" this article, found it interesting, and posted it to Reddit for like-minded individuals to enjoy. I wasn't aware the original poster was Vanity Fair.  I apologize and in the future will be more conscious of the content's origin.

 I'm not on the streets. I live in a vet shelter. 




 I always believed that my experience and education would shield me from becoming unemployed and homeless. I also believed that federal and state assistance was in place to help if I needed it. I was wrong on both accounts. I'm sharing my experience so that others may learn from it. 




 I don't have a disability, and though it's been offered, I won't game the system. 




 Federal employment (hell, almost all employment) and security clearances are hampered by a negative credit background. If you're already living paycheck-to-paycheck and then experience seven months of unemployment without benefits it doesn't take long to achieve a negative credit rating. I also encourage you to demand any member of the intelligence community to explain in detail the particulars of their job. After you're finished meeting with Homeland Security drop me a line. 




 I'll respect your opinion. 




 Women are natural targets for prostitution, especially if they have some form of addiction. Their children become pawns for the pimp to keep their mothers working. Some women are so deeply possessed by their addictions that they only peripherally care for the children and they will often leave the children with "friends" while they party.

 I truly respect, and to the extent that someone can love the intangible, I love the reddit community. Just being a member means you bring something to the table. It's up to you to decide the quality of that something you contribute. 




 Thank you for your kind words. 




 After reading your last three replies, I'll just say that we have a couple of guys here that are bipolar. That sounds mean, but it was the first impression that popped into my head. 




 Again, let me reply with all the patience and kindness that I can muster - I understand your inability to believe a story like mine. It doesn't fit into the narrative that governs your life. But my reality is that I will go to sleep tonight in my small room, and to the room on my right is an alcoholic, and to my left is a heroin addict, both fighting their own inner demons. I'm sure if someone sat down to talk with them that their lives would appear unbelievable as well. As for myself, I'm not some mysterious soldier; anyone possessing a TS/SCI clearance and signed that little paper given at the beginning and end of any debriefing can attest to the fact that there are mandatory monetary and penal consequences for anyone who reveals state secrets. I also didn't say there are no friends or family I can rely on; I did say that most of them are walking that thin line that I've fallen below. This is my current reality and I will recover from it, but the barriers in my path are very real whether or not they fit into your narrative. 




 Thank you. 




 Not that I'm aware of, but I do wish people could understand that race is a social construct. It's like discriminating between people by saying they have big bones in a world that prefers small bones. 




 Okay, but I don't care. 




 I'm on both and have reached the second level of employment for consideration as a historian. I believe both education and experience are equally important; those that can find a balance between the two are the most successful, imo. If I had to do it all over again, I would still have attempted the masters. Knowledge is a resource that, once earned, can't be taken away. As for advice:
1. try to stay close to home or family
2. find a way to maintain a means of communication
3. don't believe the state or federal social system will be there for you, it won't. the social systems that will help help you are most often found at the community level.
4. don't become too personally attached to anything of value; recognize its future value as a means to make it another day.
5. don't be afraid to ask for help; swallow your pride because there are people who take real pleasure in helping others. 




 No, the shelter doesn't provide these items. My situation is different from the other clients here in that I'm not alcohol or drug addicted, or have a service connected disability. I do suffer from PTSD, but once an individual's labeled with a mental disability, it sticks. Federal and state social agencies provide some source of income for these individuals, from which the shelter expects the clients to buy their own hygiene products. 




 That's the problem, people don't have an understanding. I have blanketed all the job sources you've mentioned. I start my search very early in the morning, for example, looking at the listings of new opportunities, and when I apply for the job there's a info graphic on the job boards stating 250-300 other people also applied for it. With transportation being cost prohibitive, only those jobs within walking distance are realistically in reach. Imagine spending the entire day walking from place to place and being rejected at every turn. There are no jobs to be had. I'm not limiting myself to just Washington, I'm putting in for any job anywhere. This is the longest I've ever been unemployed. And please don't think I'm throwing a pity-party here; this is the reality of today's job market. The kids leaving college in May will have an even more difficult time. 




 I'm a grown man who can take care of himself in most cases. But, I shudder to think about women with children placed in my situation. The threat of human predation is very real, and from what I've seen of the streets, there are entire industries that specialize in taking advantage of the disadvantaged. The poor have the smallest voice in our society, and only the most sensational instances of injustice receive any attention. If there is any chance you may become homeless plan ahead and protect your children. 




 The items most needed by the homeless are for hygiene and a means to utilize public transportation. This is the United States, and as I've repeatedly told my family, I'll never starve. Assistance with food is readily available, but hygiene products are not covered by government assistance. Shampoo, razors, soap, deodorant, and clothing are in high demand, but often unattainable. Transportation is another big issue for the homeless. Often, the means to reach a job interview aren't available because they don't have the money for public transportation. I considered myself lucky to have my car, however, I went for a job interview in downtown Seattle. I parked on the street and used what little change I had to pay the meter. Unaware that the street became a through-way for buses after a certain time, my car was ticketed, towed, and impounded. Those individuals living in Seattle will agree that the signs posted in these areas don't clearly warn the uniformed about these parking traps. When I parked, it was with a long line of cars and I paid the fare. I returned to discover my car was gone and thought it'd been stolen. After asking a student, she was unsurprised to tell me it was probably towed. With great sadness, I sold one of my two laptops to get my car back. Without the money for gas, I'm now reliant on the Seattle public transportation system, and the kindness of this shelter which has provided me with a ORCA card. It has fifty dollars on it to be used on public transportation, of which Seattle's is very good. 




 There was no offer of compensation, and litigation is reserved for those with deeper pockets than I have. 




 I'm not a religious person, so the holidays are not that important. I do volunteer work, so that's how I'm spending the holidays. Yesterday I did an event for the animal shelter by photographing people with their pets at a PetSmart. My family does know about my situation, but we come from the working class and they're all just barely making it. There are many individuals in my situation, and the numbers will continue to grow. If you saw the photos from my flikr page, there was an entire line of cars filled with people in my situation. That was only one side of the parking lot; there was another entire section filled with people living out of their cars. I studied as an historian, and understand the problems of homelessness. In fact, understanding the system that placed me in this situation makes it that much more frustrating. After moving into this shelter, I was asked by the director to represent the clients in an interview with the E network. I had mixed feelings about this, because I was a college instructor for a short period, and the thought of my students seeing how far I'd fallen was shameful. However, the benefit of helping not only other veterans, but the homeless as well, overrode my prideful side. My situation is what it is, but it doesn't define who I am, and it has humbled me. 




 I give up on this line of questioning. You win. 




 I'm desperate for any job which is why I've taken education and experience off my resume. There aren't any jobs out there. I'm on every job board I'm aware of, but there are many, many individuals out of work and looking for employment. I apply in person, however, being forty-five-years-old places me in an under/unemployable age bracket. If I could find a job washing dishes, I would do it. 




 A large part of my day was spent trying to find food, a place to shower, and avoiding the police. Authorities seem to have a second sense when it comes to homeless people, who they consider a bad image for the city. Libraries are a great resource, but many of them have rules in place to discourage use by the homeless. I'm someone who is attentive to hygiene, so having to go days without bathing absolutely annoyed me. To save money on razors, I grew a beard, which I keep neatly trimmed. Maintaining clean clothing is another big challenge. Laundromats are expensive and there aren't many resources for the homeless in this area. I want to share a photo of my shelter, but for the privacy of other residents, I'm simply not allowed. 




 You can AMA but expect me to get angry if I'm called a liar. 




 Every day the financial hole gets deeper. I've just found a part-time job teaching, but it doesn't begin until late January. I've removed the education portion and any dates from my resume, and started receiving more replies. My daily goal is to apply for 5 jobs per day. I've been passed on to the second round of the interview process with the federal government for a historians position. This is a first in a vast number of attempts. My fear is that the financial portion of the background check will preclude me from consideration. After securing a steady paycheck, the next six months will be spent trying to dig my way out of this financial morass. 




 I don't mind giving particulars about my homeless situation, but don't ask me what I did in the military. 




 I was a 98j10 mos. Look it up and then KMA. 




 I felt my education and work background insulated me from ever becoming homeless. I was wrong. As a member of the working class in the U.S., my drop into the truly indigent was short and painful. I didn't mean the description to sound creepy, but if a redditor is in the working class, my situation can serve as an abject example. 




 Please see my posted reply to redfoxrun. 




 I am a 45-year-old male who found himself homeless because of the current financial downturn. In 2006 I completed two bachelors, one in journalism, the other in history. Over the next four years I worked toward a masters in history. With the economy worsening, I realized the opportunity to finish my masters was limited. No one in my family has gone beyond a bachelors so my efforts were considered a matter of pride for my dad. In order to pass the summer exams, I quit my job to study. I paid for school and living expenses using a small retirement 401K and a savings account of about $2000. I believed that earning a masters would provide more job opportunities, so the gamble was worth it, imo. As I studied over the summer, I flooded the job market with resumes. After taking and passing my exams on August 21, I received a job offer in public relations from a large company in Seattle. I jumped at the opportunity, and having exhausted all my financial resources, sold all my household goods on craigslist. After arriving in Seattle, I received an email from the HR head of this large firm stating the PR position was an entry level job and I was over qualified for it. He went on to state that someone with my education background and work experience was unlikely to remain with their corporation at the entry level position. The offer was rescinded and I found myself without a job, home, or funds outside of Tacoma, Washington. I'd held back a few items to sell if I reached a desperate state, such as needing gas or food. The first item to go was my favorite dress watch, pawned for food and gas money. My vacuum cleaner went next, and then several wall clocks. These were all small items that fit in the trunk of my car. I had two laptops, but didn't want to part with either because I consider them indispensable for finding work. I attempted to enter a homeless shelter in Tacoma, but after two failed robberies by individuals trying to break into my car, I decided to find a rest stop to park and live. [This](http://www.flickr.com/photos/55230349@N04/) is where I lived for the next two months. As the days grew colder, I turned to Veterans Affairs for help. First, I went to the VA hospital in American Lake just south of Tacoma. Because I didn't suffer from an alcohol or drug addiction, my options were limited. I continued searching for jobs, but because I'd never been homeless or lived on food stamps, I didn't know where or how to apply for these services. Because I'd quit my job, unemployment benefits were not available. When asked by Washington State officials if I was unable to work because of a disability, I had to answer in the negative. This meant I wasn't eligible for monetary assistance but I was given food stamps. I continually contacted the VA social worker at American Lake to ask for help, but there just wasn't much assistance for someone in my position. I was eventually referred to a VA social worker in Seattle, and within days he placed me in the veterans shelter where I'm now living. I'm still angry and confused about a system that I've paid into for my entire adult life only to find it of no use when I needed it the most. 




 I served from Oct 1983 to Oct 1991; I can't tell you the particulars of my enlistment because it's considered classified and the consequences would mean many, many years in a federal prison. There's also a financial penalty, but it doesn't mean much to someone who has nothing to take. I'll post the circumstances of my situation in a reply to redFoxRun. 




 It is a nice shelter, but more importantly, it is safe. Most homeless shelters are populated by individuals with drinking or drug abuse problems; individuals in such a shelter are prone to rapid mood changes and they're always on the hunt for the means to carry on their addictions. They make no distinctions between wealthy or poor; if you have anything worth selling, they will attempt to take it. I need to stress, however, that individuals such as these are in the grip of a disease they can control but don't know how. They aren't really bad people. They're simply desperate.
