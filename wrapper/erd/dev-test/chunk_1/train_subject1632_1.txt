 I love this story of his!  I've heard him tell it in a recording of a 3 hour lecture, just before a break.  Great punchline... :D

 Why show up in the thread if you only came to impose a hierarchy, where only your version of anarchism is allowed?  It's evident in this thread and elsewhere in the sub that at least a few anarchists disagree about the particulars of personal property. 




 This is an effective response in many situations where people want to talk about "good cops."  Of course police officers are human beings, and many of them are reasonably nice people; as mentioned elsewhere, police work is attractive to a certain set of society for purely practical reasons (e.g. nice pension   pay, no degree required).

But these folks have dedicated their careers to actively supporting and taking part in a system that violently oppresses entire classes of society.  Debating whether the people involved are good or bad is generally a diversion from meaningful discussion about the causes of police brutality and possible solutions. 




 Wow...beautiful track.  A bit simplistic, but nice. 




 I recently acquired a few ounces of Plum Pudding, which is the first genuine English style blend I've smoked.

My first reaction was...wow.  How many distinct flavors can there be in one tobacco!  In particular, I was amazed at how nuanced and unique the smokey flavors of (I believe) the Latakia were.  I've smoked and enjoyed many blends by now, each with their own character and evolution...but nothing with this level of complexity.  And yet, I didn't find it harsh or overwhelming.

For those of you who are familiar with many English blends and with Plum Pudding - do you find the general qualities of this blend are common to many other English?  Are there specific other blends you'd recommend, knowing that I enjoy Plum Pudding?  How does it compare?

Have you had a similar experience when you first tried English style blends? 




 Other people are debating already.  Debate can be a powerful learning process; you don't have to be knowledgeable in a subject to have a useful debate with someone on that subject. 




 Ah, yes...these are all good points, and that is a fascinating read.

In fact, it offers solutions to most of the problems posed by OP. 




 Those are bold claims.  You believe that lobbying is less powerful as a political force than decentralized communication between individuals on the internet?

Why is it, then, that [voting behavior in America serves the aims of capital holders at the expense of the people](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online aid=9354310)?  




 In actuality, I'd probably contact all my friends and relatives and see what they were doing about it.  Isn't that what most folks would do?

I'm pretty sure with 100 or so twenty and thirty somethings + their parents and no private property rights we could figure out a reasonably self-sufficient existence for ourselves.

But how does that relate to my hypothetical?  You think everybody would get food by doing oddjobs for this guy? 




 No, no.  I appreciate that OP is genuinely trying to debate this, and that they have some basic understanding of debate being a contest of ideas, where one tries to show through reason that an idea is true or false.

There are many folks in this sub who think it's a great place to call people names and dismiss their ideas as unworthy of discussion on the basis of their ethnic, political, or ideological group affiliation.

At least OP is trying.  Why not try to refute OP's ideas, or to convince OP of some alternate point of view? 




 I guess you've abandoned the claim that 3rd world labor exploitation is a problem with non-capitalist 3rd world governments, and isn't a fault of capitalist systems and firms. :P

...

You've offered several ideas about how to keep capitalism and lose exploitation of labor from poorer countries.  Imposing a minimum wage on foreign labor sounds like a great way to drive innovation in robotics and artificial intelligence, which would certainly reduce exploitation of labor forces.

I doubt that it could ever pass in a country committed to capitalism and democracy, though.  Just imagine an American Congressperson introducing such legislation!  It'd be political suicide; their capital-holding supporters would withdraw their financial and mainstream media support and pour millions into pro-exploitation opponents in the next election. 




 It's not necessarily idealistic.  I think gigacannon is saying that it's *possible* to create a good anarchist society, and that we could do it together *with a great deal of hard work, without which it would fail*.

Sounds pretty realistic to me.

Where does gigacannon assume that everyone will commit their time and effort?  While we're at it, why should such a thing require *everyone*? 




 I don't believe that's true at all, in this context.

If I had no means of obtaining food, I would not cling to my individualism and start looking for seeds in the wild so that I could grow something and eat it.  I would look for others who knew how to get some food, or who had food and might give it to me.

I don't believe that I'm unique in that.

If everybody had to work directly with others to survive because no imposed system existed, I imagine most people would start working together.

That doesn't require that everybody become selfless or that nobody ever screwed anybody else in order to get what they want.  It just requires that it's in most people's apparent self-interest to cooperate.

Incidentally, that's what we've got right now:  it's in most people's self-interest to go along with whatever imposed system exists in order to get their needs met, so that's what people tend to do.

Perhaps anarchist systems exist in which it's in most people's interest to cooperate with others in a decentralized, non-hierarchical way. 




 Hmm...I'm not sure that's relevant to Nihilozero's objection.  Don't you see how exploitation of 3rd world laborers, accomplished through the control of capital by multinational corporations in order to export and sell goods in capitalist economies is relevant to your claim that state and corporate capitalism isn't working?

If you believe that the problem is with the governments in countries where laborers are being exploited, and that existing capitalist systems are not responsible for it, you should at least formulate an argument in favor of this view.

It seems fairly obvious to me that the entities doing the exploitation are responsible for their actions, and that the system that enables concentrated control of capital by those entities is also responsible. 




 That's a very different and more reasonable claim than the one you led with.  I wonder if the anarchists here have a good reply. 




 Most of this is not true; you seem to have false beliefs about what we know about prehistoric humans.

We don't know that prehistoric humans had single leaders.  We don't know that they lived in small, scattered groups; there is some evidence that they lived in small family groups during some periods, but we certainly don't know. We have no reason whatsoever to believe that they lacked complex emotions *or language*, nor that they were any less rational than humans are today (unless you go back to other *species* with a smaller brains; farther than the time you're talking about).

Where you getting these ideas?  Has some great scientific discovery been made of which I am ignorant? 




 Pot calling the kettle black :/  PM_ME_YOUR_BBQ may not be familiar with anarchism, but at least they have some understanding of debate and are attempting to engage in it. 




 Interesting...

How can socialist economics be implemented without a governing body that collects taxes under threat of force? 




 Ah, for sure.

Without the deterrent of existing criminal justice systems, violence and fear of violence would be widespread? 




 You're saying that without a government and police force like we have now, individuals would have inadequate defense against the violence of others.  Right? 




 I suppose those things are both true.  How does that imply that anarchism could only succeed if all people were perfect? 




 It's a necessary and good comment for this sub; I hope to see many more like it.  /r/Anarchism is filled with hierarchies. 




 Go outside and play! 




 Then why are you posting in /r/DebateAnarchism? 




 OP made an argument in support of his claim.  You claimed it was a straw man.  You each have a burden of proof, but only OP has attempted to deliver.

If you want to debate, it's on you to show why OP failed.  Simply claiming that he has is no refutation. 




 Why isn't it true?  This is a debate subreddit. 




 Why couldn't it work without everybody being perfect? 




 Is there any specific statement made in the OP that you take issue with?  Your comment adds nothing to this. 




 You might really enjoy taking MDMA with a friend you trust, or perhaps alone.  Since you have a tendency toward anxiety, you should only take it if you can get a reliably pure and measure dose, and take a small dose to start.

[MDMA](http://maps.org/research/mdma) is a very beautiful and healing substance in the right setting.  At low-moderate doses (~100mg) with good hydration and no overheating it is perfectly safe.  It can help you get back in touch with feelings of love and empathy for yourself and others.  It's not a psychedelic drug, but it has some similarities.

Taking psychedelic drugs is a more challenging thing for a person prone to anxiety and perhaps depression.  You will almost certainly experience anxiety on psychedelic drugs.  It can be very good - a transformative experience, even.

You can also have very difficult and unpleasant experiences.  You anxiety could come up, and grow, transforming into a psychedelic fueled beast.  There are many things you can do to influence the kind of experience you have, and techniques that you or a friend can use to guide psychedelic experiences.  But you can't necessarily control this experience, and you may be terrified by that at times (as most people who've used psychedelics sometimes are).

So I see psychedelics as an undertaking, especially for folks who come to them with a particular negative experience they'd like to transform.  A noble and good undertaking!  But not one to be taken lightly.

I encourage you to try it out, though.  You should only use psychedelics if you can obtain a reliably measured and pure dose.  For example, you could buy a few grams of shrooms and a scale.  2 grams of psilocybe cubensis is a good starting point; it won't be very strong, so you can get familiar with what shrooms are like without feeling overwhelmed.  Then you can try 2.5 or 3 grams next time, if you like (a week or more later). 




 Psychedelics can burn you hard, but the mental health industry can easily convince you that there's little hope for great change and that you have to take these little pills forever that block out many aspects of human experience.

Whatever you decide to consume, be careful. :) 




 In many psychedelic and consciousness expansion oriented communities, I see this strong interest in forming new ways of conceptualizing or explaining consciousness and/or reality.

It seems to me like the most wrong-headed approach a person could possibly take, short of setting out to confirm an existing conceptual model of consciousness / reality.

In my life, the most important thing I have learned from my efforts to learn by exploring the depths of human experience is to accept the primacy of subjective experience.  I know that everything I have experienced and ever could experience has been just that - a subjective experience.  Every conceptual model of reality, every idea, every perception, everything has been just that.

You say:

But folks, it's just in your brain. Breathe, close your eyes, exhale taking your horizon to the farthest stars, the depths of the mind, reckon reality's weight, open your eyes and realize it's all in your head.

And I'm with you - with one small, but extremely important shift.  That idea, that perception, that this is all in a *location*, and in the *brain* in particular, is itself subject to that same truth - this is all in my head, my brain.  The idea and experience of location is located?  In my brain?  And what is a brain?  Another idea, ultimately.  You might say "no, no - the *actual* brain, the *actual* location!"  What's that?  It's the idea of a brain beyond the idea of a brain.

If I truly believe in a brain, that belief seems psychotic - it contradicts itself in an infinitely repeating spiral of brains.  It's not unlike the belief that "everything is one."  ^Everything ^is..^one?  ^^What's ^^one?  ^^Is ^^one ^^one?  ^^^AGHSGHGHGh

Similarly, if I believe my experience to be a completely separate entity from some other existent something somewhere else, that belief contradicts itself.  My conception of a separate entity is part of this experience; my conception of subjective experience is part of this experience.  There's no escaping this; nothing outside this, and nothing beyond this.

As human beings, we have this tendency, this habit, to go about conceptually modeling our experience.  It's an imperfect system.  In my experience, examining the edge case contradictions carefully has relaxed my attachment to it and allowed me to see it for what it is - an imperfect tool for dealing with practical problems.

So I don't try to conceptualize reality as an end in itself.  I'm curious about future conceptual models, especially those that come from analytic philosophers operating on the findings and ideas of scientists.  But I have no expectation that they'll come up with a model that doesn't suffer this same problem, because it's not a problem of lacking information - it's a problem with the system of mind.  Mind did not evolve in order to apprehend the absolute truth of reality.  It appears to exist in order to solve day-to-day practical problems well enough to keep us animals alive long enough to successfully breed.

...

That act, though, of looking up into the stars, of taking in the most vast and expansive scene...and acknowledging that it's reality.  I don't believe that the words, the conceptualization if necessary.  It can provoke an incredible shift, to acknowledge that this experience of vastness is apparently quite small, between my ears, and so on.  The activity of a brain.

But to stick on that idea, believing it to be true...what a mistake.  Not to say that you've made that mistake, in particular; your thought gave me quite a platform to launch from, but I do not know what was behind it (nor do I mean to assume that you believe any thought I've shared above).  Look at what is there, before your eyes!  In your mind!  In nobody's mind!  Before any idea about any brain or cosmos or you ever happened at all... 




 He's pretty easy to deal with before he's snowballed on ganks.  He has terrible stat gain and limited late-game damage.  He can be hit with untargeted spells while invisible, because his position is revealed.

What's the big deal? 




 Fuck that.  I see people in all kinds of ethnic groups espousing naive liberal bullshit. 




 He didn't say they fired live ammunition - only that they pointed guns loaded with live ammunition at him.  It's a big deal. 




 Oh god no please don't this swimming nonsense into reddit. 




 You've assumed that the pineal gland and the third eye are synonymous.  Why? 




 I've experienced strong effects from binaural beats and other forms of brainwave entrainment.  I've never used streamed audio for it; I wonder if the effect still works on heavily compressed source material. 




 I see "check your privilege" as one of those memes that only this special brand of simple-minded idiocy brought to you by years of mainstream/social media consumption can make appealing.  It's function seems to be to let you feel knowledgeable and superior while crippling any meaningful discussion of the complexities of life. 




 Not checking privilege is not an error in reasoning at all; it is simply an omission, a non-act.  A fallacy is a specific use of faulty logic.  It is like making a mistake on a math problem; when revealed, it is indisputable.  Ignorance alone is not a fallacy.

In this example, the error is the assumption that one's own experience is great evidence for what others have experienced.  It's pretty easy to point out this sort of error to a somewhat reasonable person in a way that they can hear and consider.  This is a great way to change the view of an intelligent person who's not on the defensive.

Aggressive demands like "check your privilege" are not a great way to change a person's view.

Just imagine...

"Check your privilege!"

"Why should I check my privilege?  I don't see any reason to believe I'm privileged - I worked hard for what I have.  All you see is an educated white guy, but I grew up poor and my grandma is from Israel.  Anyway I feel assaulted and this person is rude and doesn't make sense.  Fuck these anarchists - I'm going back to /r/politics!" 




 To me, that seems like such a strange thing to care about and identify with.  A person who is 1/8th Native must have about 7/8ths of other ancestries - and likely another ancestry holds the majority.  Why should such a person identify so strongly with their Native 1/8th as to be saddened by their lack of obvious Native features?

I don't mean this to be dismissive or unkind - I'm genuinely curious about your views on this, as you obviously have first-hand experience and care about it a great deal.  But on reading this now, it seems to me that I have about as much reason to identify as Irish, having an Irish-born great grandparent in my family tree.  But it would be a bit silly for me to lament my lack of visible Irish traits, wouldn't it? 




 :/ 




 Why is that a sad fact?  What's wrong with looking white? 




 What use can it serve to reply to a fallacious argument with "check your privilege," which would not be better served by pointing out the error in reasoning?  Any time fallacy has been committed, a direct and straightforward refutation can be made.

Why respond to faulty logic in a way that invites the person to miss the point entirely, when you could simply point out the faulty logic? 




 I don't believe that such people exist; there's no way to answer this question without acknowledging its baseless assumption that drugs turn people into nutters. 




 Hmm...yeah, sure.  Though it's far off topic.

You said:

 News is easy to digest. The media feeds us small bites of trivial matter, tidbits that don't really concern our lives and don't require thinking.

 lol, no it isn't. maybe the news you read is like that, but most news that actually is interesting enough to read has humoungous complex ramifications that not even a expert could fully understand on their own.

The article says that news is easy to digest.  Indeed, a great deal of news is easy to digest and trivial.  Instead of disputing this, you say that the claim is false because any news that's "interesting enough to read" isn't this way.

On a strict literal reading of the article's statement, you might think this is just fine.  But the argument's intent is clearly not to claim that every bit of news ever made is trivial and easy to digest.  It's talking about the general trend, the majority.

That there is some interesting and thought-provoking news somewhere is no contradiction to the claim that the vast majority of news is simplistic drivel.  In common speech, that would be said "News is simplistic drivel."  Kind of like how we can say "cats have four legs."  I'm not claiming that there are no three-legged cats when I say that.

* News is simplistic drivel
* But *real* news is actually quite thought-provoking
* Therefore news is not simplistic drivel

The conclusion does not follow.  You could characterize this as a variant of "No True Scotsman."  Is there some news somewhere that's actually quite complex and thought provoking?  Perhaps.  Does that change the rest of the news?  No. 




 I guess it doesn't bother you then.  You have patterns of thinking that lead to false conclusions, and you like it that way.  Oh well! :D 




 Haha, yeah.  If you accepted the idea that claims argued poorly are necessarily false, you'd have quite a collection of false claims... 




 There are important differences.  In particular, using a loan to start a business doesn't satisfy the hypothetical situation posed by your capitalist debate partner.

Although plenty of people use cash to start businesses, and occasionally even small businesses, this hypothetical is irrelevant to most compelling situations where anarchists and capitalist libertarians disagree.

Yes, sometimes a worker is able to generate enough money or equity to acquire means of production and work for themselves or even start a corporation.  But this represents a vanishingly small proportion of economic activity in capitalist economies on the scale of an actual state (let alone multinational economies).  In reality, the vast majority of economic activity comes from a relatively small number of entities that together control almost all capital.  

Do workers ever start small businesses?  Yes.  Marxism has a word for these folks, and it isn't flattering.  They do not matter, and it does not matter if their contribution to the economy is simultaneously capitalist and ethical.  In any existent capitalist economy, they are utterly dwarfed by the true players - whose actions cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be construed as ethical.

For what it's worth.  There are many ways to go with this kind of hypothetical, but I honestly don't have any patience for it.  It's just a diversion from the actual problems of capitalism, imo. 




 Yeah...it's not salvia, and there's a good chance that its impregnated with dangerous novel synthetic chemicals.  Don't test it on human subjects. 




 Of course, of course.  It won't hurt, but it isn't something to rely on either.

Urinary pH influences the rate of elimination of amphetamine; perhaps taking a large dose of vitamin C or of citric acid (juice) would influence this enough to reduce the duration of an experience already underway, but I'm quite skeptical.

Coadministration with acidic juices is another matter, and certainly can effect absorption of amphetamine on an empty stomach. 




 Yes, that's true.  Although half-life doesn't translate directly into duration of effect, given such a long half-life I wouldn't expect the effect to be mostly gone by hour 6.

My experience with IR adderall was that I would not sleep for at least 8 hours after a low dose (10 or 20mg).

People do vary quite a bit in their ability to sleep on the trailing end of a stimulant drug experience, though.  I wouldn't take oral amphetamine past noon if I wanted to sleep at 10:30, but I also wouldn't drink a cup of coffee past 2pm. 




 This isn't true at all. :/ 




 That's highly unlikely.  I did a quick search but was unable to find an easy, kitchen chemistry method for defeating the time release of dextromethorphan polistirex.  Perhaps it's out there.  There are whispers all over drugs forums about some post somewhere that reports a lemon juice method that works, but I couldn't find a reliable description.

If you're dosing tonight, I'd just take it as is. 




 Yeah, I have no problem with your answer dude. 




 The degree of dependence differs between them.  It's relevant.  Askdrugs is a harm reduction sub. 




 Dependence will occur with regular use of benzodiazepenes at a decent dosage in just about anybody...it should certainly be a factor considered in a decision between benzodiazepenes.  OP's doctor has surely considered it, and that may even be their primary reason for switching OP off Xanax. 




 Lorazepam (Ativan) is shorter acting than Clonazepam, which makes it a better candidate for recreational use.  However, it is slightly more habit forming; you'll likely have greater difficulties with dependence and withdrawal on lorazepam than clonazepam.

They have quite similar effects apart from duration in my experience. 




 Well, I think you'd benefit greatly from reading through your post with the poster up, identifying each fallacy you used.  I don't imagine you care.  But I thought I'd give it a try.  The errors in reasoning are there; your thinking is faulty.

Doesn't that bother you? 




 For sure...I had a good chuckle at the irony as I began reading, too. 




 It's not a news article.  It's a reprinted excerpt of an essay. 




 This is an edited extract from an essay first published at dobelli.com. The Art of Thinking Clearly: Better Thinking, Better Decisions by Rolf Dobelli

It's ironic for the Guardian to republish an extract of this essay, but it's not a news piece.  Did you read it?  It's quite obviously an analytic essay, which is about as far from news copy as you can get without being a novel. 




 This is an edited extract from an essay first published at dobelli.com. The Art of Thinking Clearly: Better Thinking, Better Decisions by Rolf Dobelli

Reading news inhibits your ability to distinguish the source of the material you're reading! :P 




 It's no refutation to simply claim that an argument is baseless, its author a moron, and so on.  You would benefit from a [basic education in common errors in reasoning](http://i.imgur.com/OOA8QzF.jpg).  Most of your replies contain at least one - all of which can be found on the linked poster!

If you truly believe that any specific statement in the article was false, you could do yourselves and us a service by attempting to refute it.  Go ahead - find a line or reasoning in the article with a conclusion that you believe doesn't follow, quote it here, and then show why it's wrong. 




 (Just in case anybody cares to read this long, tangential rambling)

Well...I don't have a particular take on plant consciousness, I guess.

But I don't have a particular take on human consciousness, either.  I studied cognitive neuroscience, comparative neurobiology, philosophy, and psychology for a few years at university.  I've practiced mindfulness and used psychedelics and other tools to learn about human experience directly.  I lost a lot of beliefs about life and consciousness through all of this, because I realized that I have no reason to believe that I am conscious - that consciousness is in any way particularly associated with me or my humanness.

There are things that it's like to be human.  There's something that it's like to see blue, to feel a touch, to think a particular thought, and so on.  These experiences depend on different parts of the human body functioning a certain way. Some of these dependencies are well mapped by scientists, like the parts of the visual cortex that do the calculations that map the edges of objects.  You won't see edges without that activity occurring.

But there's no particular reason why those cells relating to one another that way should look like edges; they do the math that calculates edges, but so can many things.  They're cells, but so are many cells.  People have told me that the perception of edges must be in the neurons that calculate the shape of edges, and other variations on that theme.  Well, which part?  Is it this neuron, or that?  Is it the whole network?  If so, then shouldn't any network of neurons have a subjective experience associated?  And what about other cells?  And what about non-cell molecules that are arranged similarly?  Etc.

There doesn't seem to be any way to draw a line between any particular thing that has subjective experiences (like a part of a network of cells, or a brain, or an organism) and some other thing that doesn't without entailing some logical contradiction.  And when I examine my own experience directly through mindfulness, I notice that things I take to be conscious, to be me, easily lose that quality of seeming awareness and dissolve whenever I cease to identify with them.  Subjectively, there doesn't seem to be any entity that consciousness is associated with in particular.

But there's something that it's like to experience everything I've ever experienced, and I have no reason to believe that's different beyond what I can experience.  So, I imagine there's something that it's like to be a plant, or some part of a plant, or any part of a plant, and that it's related to the way that plants interact with other things (the way that the particulars of human visual experience are related to the way our eyes and nerves and brains and so on interact with our world).  And I imagine there's something that it's like to be dirt, and rocks, and air, that's somehow related to what air and dirt and rocks are from other perspectives.

...

It's quite funny to me, now, that to many people, the idea that plants (or bacteria, or rocks) have some kind of experience is controversial, is a claim that requires evidence.  Has anybody ever seen anything that wasn't some kind of experience?  Of course not.

So shouldn't the controversial claim, the claim that would require some great weight of evidence, be the claim that something somewhere *isn't* having an experience? 




 Great article.  Much of what they say about news applies equally to most of reddit. 




 Only the orientals are safe 




 Seconded.  Remember not to scrimp on quality thermal compound, either.  Correctly applied, it'll drop your core temperature by 12 to 16 C. 




 Really?  I read through the thread and I honestly can't see how banning Nyoza would improve the subreddit.  Is the goal to become a circlejerk where everybody sees everything exactly the same way? 




 I resonate with much of what you said, but I do feel that it's oversimplifying very complex social dynamics.

I see your opening as a kind of false middle ground appeal.  The existence of extremes doesn't imply that a middle ground would be superior to either extreme, nor that both extremes have their place - any more than it implies that one or the other extreme is superior.

Do you know what I mean?  It's very bold to claim that some balance between violence and complete obedience is the way of progress.  Many great things have been accomplished through violent revolution, and many great things have been accomplished through pacifism.  It's not obvious what any particular person or movement should do at any particular time. 




 Ho ho!  May the clear light of an unclouded intellect shine upon your ebony man-curls as the first rays of dawn!  May the frigid salty spray of incontrovertible insight dash upon the rocks of your chiseled captainesque countenance!

edit: seriously I wish you no ill.  cheers.. 




 I never called you childish - I called your line of reasoning childish.  Was it a personal attack?  I don't think so, but it's debatable.  In the context of that conversation it was no more impolite than what it followed.

Anyway, goodbye.  I only have so much time and I'd like to spend it another way now.  I wish you the best.  May the light of reason one day shine upon your blessed black beard! 




 It's no lie.  Look at each reply you made.  Not one of them addresses the *actual claim being made and its underlying reasoning*.  You quote me, and then you attack me.  But what you don't do is make any specific logical objection to any specific thing I've said.

Debate is not just vehement disagreement going back and forth.  When you quoted me saying that your definition of racism is not common or useful, you support that I never claimed it was not valid.  You know why?  Because I never used the word valid, and you didn't make any argument to show that my argument entailed it not being valid.

If you had, then I could have conceded the point or offered  rebuttal or whatever, and we could debate.  Because all you've done is quote me and express violent disagreement, there is no debate to be had.

Do you see the difference?  It's about reason.  Logic.  Addressing the idea instead of making it personal. 




 Really...you tell me that pointing out flaws in your reasoning and trying to convince you to address the idea instead of abusing me *in a debate subreddit* is bad because I should "refute the central point, and not the character of the person" as per the rules.  In the same post, you look up my posting history, call me a libertarian because I've posted in r/bitcoin, and tell me to go back to /r/libertarian and leave /r/debateanarchism?

Meh.  I guess I'll give up on you seeing reason for now.

I keep trying to think of something to say to how you still think I've questioned whether your definition of racism is valid, but all I would say is what you already quoted me saying.  It's as though you don't speak English. :/

Ok bye. 




 I have seen similar things.  It's a real bummer to meet people who seem to be into anarchism, freedom, dismantling oppression, etc...and then it turns out they're the evil twins of white bigotry.

Like most anti-rational hate mongering, this too is weak and failing.  Yay :D 




 Come on!  I am not arrogant and I'm not a troll.  I'm trying to get you to engage in debate, which is the purpose of this sub.

Debate can only happen when at least two people agree to engage in rational discourse.  When you reply to my postings only to insult me or to pretend that I've said one thing when in fact I said another, no debate can occur.

Which is a bummer, because debate is excellent!  That is why I keep suggesting that you address the logic, the reason.  You know things that I don't know.  I know things that you don't know.

I could be wrong about everything I've claimed in this thread!  I don't know yet because nobody has attempted to refute me. 




 Why don't you follow the rules of this subreddit and its topic?  This is a debate sub.

If you disagree with an argument I've made, please tell me why it's flawed.  Then we could have a debate ! :D

I never questioned whether it was a valid definition, whatever that means to you.  It's internally consistent.  I said it was a useful concept.  But it's not a common definition.  I did a little reading and learned that it's a significant, but fringe definition used by some sociologists.  Perhaps its also common among some anarchist subcultures? 

Your source wasn't relevant to my claim that its not a common definition.  You have yet to address that..

edit:  /r/Libertarian is not how I came to this sub.  There is little or no good debate to be had there. 




 Hey, I made a light jab at you while making a relevant point about your linguistics derail trolling, and I moved on.  My jab doesn't change anything about the value of the arguments I've made before, during, and after it.

Whether any particular argument I've posed to you is sound remains to be seen, as you have yet to address anything I've said...

Or, for that matter, anything anybody has said.  Every reply I see by you here misses the point and attempts to refute a straw-person.. at best. 




 Capn Blackbeard, I'm beginning to suspect that your interest in posting in /r/DebateAnarchism is not, in fact, to debate anarchism.  I've pointed out a clear and, at this point, obvious flaw in your reasoning - and your response is to flame me.

Why?  Why not refute my reasoning, as I appear to have refuted yours? 




 I never claimed that you are the only person who uses the definition of racism that, in this thread, only appears to be held by you.  I claimed that it is not a commonly held or particularly useful definition of racism.  That it's been used in a book, a blog post, and on an anarchist website is no contradiction.

Perhaps it would be more useful to discuss the use of this definition within various subcultures at present, or to discuss the merits and detriments of various definitions of racism, or to discuss anything at all without resorting to faulty rhetoric and personal attacks. 




 Blatant straw person argument - come on, Capn Blackbeard. blackrosesinwinter did not claim that words work just fine without any consensus of meaning at all - they simply claimed, quite reasonably, that language works without "having strict definitions for every word."

You're not trying to understand other people's point of view, or even to understand their posts in the most basic sense.  Why even talk? 




 I'm with you.  Capn Blackbeard has a boner for making everybody use their definition of racism, correcting people for using language the way they use language.  It's childish and accomplishes nothing. 




 You're just nitpicking semantics now.  Like several others in this thread, I don't think your definition of racism is commonly held or useful.  You should find a new word.

edit:  It's a useful concept, it just doesn't make sense to call it racism when the etymology and common usage of the word directly contradict your preferred use. 




  I really don't agree that they "only perpetuate racism," as using racism like that robs it of any power. If we can say that me calling a black person the n word, and them calling me a cracker are both racism, then its useless as a word because those are such qualitatively different things.

I suspect that you have a good point, but you've overstated it so strongly as to be absurd.  There is use for a concept that captures derogatory use of the word nigger, that also captures derogatory use of the word cracker.  If you think that racism should only refer to discrimination based on race that is directed toward people who aren't white, you should present an argument in favor (or at least present a coherent, rational position). 




 I've dealt with a fair amount of psychedelic anxiety.  My approach has been to buy a scale and measure doses, taking fairly low doses often as a way to engage with my anxiety and learn to relax with the experience of a drug.  It's worked well for me.  Over time, I've grown much more accepting of the loss of control that comes with high doses.

A scale that can accurately weigh doses of 10, 20, or 30mg is fairly expensive, but is an absolute necessity when preparing doses of a substance like psilacetin.

Psilacetin is comparable to psilocin and shrooms.  Just use the same literature as a guide you would use for shrooms, but dose according to specific advice for dosing psilacetin (like the advice from tozy92 above). 




 No - it's not normal.  But for now, try to take your mind off it, stay hydrated, don't take any more drugs until you've come down.  Relax.

But unless you start feeling worse, the best thing you can do now is to chill out and sober up.  If you feel worse, go to the ER.  Otherwise, call a doctor tomorrow, tell them you had chest pain that scared you, and get your heart checked out.  It's the only sane thing to do.

And, of course, **don't do any more stimulant drugs**.  And lay off the weed as well until you've seen a doctor and confirmed that you're ok. 




 Sounds like a pretty normal low dose experience.  Visual effects come at higher doses than effects on internal perceptions, mood, thought process, etc.  Though most would experience some visuals at a 3 gram dose, people vary in their response, and shrooms vary in potency.

I'd suggest trying the same dose with a proper week-long break from the SSRI before upping the dose, though.  But if that yields a similar result, he could try 4g after that.  Could be quite a different experience. ^_^ 




 I disagree.  It sounds to me like he was quite conflicted, and tried to change what was happening while working there until he finally gave up and then *continued to try to change it from the outside*.  There's no need to demonize someone just because he happened to be a cop for a few years. 




 You shouldn't have.  Almost every piece of writing intended for popular consumption has some disgustingly common misuse of jargon that will offend any person who knows the field where that jargon originated.  Why let that stop you from reading a thought-provoking and insightful opinion piece by a former cop who should really know better than to call a magazine a clip? 




 The internet, unlike real life, never forgets.  That isn't a good thing.  People change constantly, and their past should be allowed to soften and...well, pass.

Yet I see a string of hateful comments from people who won't accept your apology, or at least keep their anger about things long gone to themselves.  Why hold on to things said years ago, views expressed that are no longer held?  Life is not like that.  Why behave so childishly just because you're on the internet?

If you can't forgive, at least let your misguided anger go unspoken.  It serves no useful purpose. 




 The negative effects that marijuana has on memory are substantial, and you have good reason to be concerned for your girlfriend's ability to perform in school.

Perhaps you could help her by sharing this excellent news from the world of science: [at least some of the negative effects on memory can be blocked by pretreatment with an NSAID or other anti-inflammatory food or drug](http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/in-mice-anti-inflammatories-amelior-13-11-21/).

Your girlfriend could keep smoking just as she is now, but add some anti-inflammatory foods to her diet (e.g. ginger, turmeric) and take less of a hit to her memory. 




 If it does effect the trip, it will only reduce the effects of the shrooms.  So you have nothing to fear from an interaction; the worst case is disappointment.

Although by now, I suppose you've already tripped.  Please share how it went!  It could be useful information for another Celexa user searching reddit one day. 




 Yes, whey protein is absorbed very quickly relative to casein and common whole food proteins.  This is probably why it's so effective post-workout. 




 Yeah...JigabooFriday needs to share more details, this doesn't sound like any DXM-only reaction I've ever heard of. 




 That's true, but misleading.  Black market synthetic drugs often contain active byproducts of the production process.  Perhaps purity is not the right word here, as it's common for amphetamine to be combined with an inert binder and pressed into pills (which is obviously not a problem).

At any rate, I can't advise you about judging the quality of black market amphetamine as I haven't used it since my early college years.  It should be easy enough [in this day and age](/r/darknetmarkets) to buy some diverted pharmaceutical amphetamine if you have concerns about the quality of what's available.   




 If you get reasonably pure amphetamine, there should be little or no noticeable difference.  The only significant difference you should find is with Adderall extended release.  You can approximate the effect of extended release by dividing a single dose into two doses, taken several hours apart.

There will be minor differences in the effect and potency because of differing ratios between the two isomers of amphetamine.  Amphetamine is a chiral molecule; it exists in multiple, chemically equivalent forms that mirror one another but behave slightly differently.  In the case of amphetamine, the difference in activity between the two isomers is not great.  Adderall has a set ratio between them (1:3).  I'm not sure about street amphetamine's isomer ratio, but I imagine it varies.

That said, you're unlikely to be able to tell the difference at equivalent doses. 







































 Hello!  I've been smoking a pipe for a few months and enjoy it quite a bit.  I'm about to restock on tobacco and am looking for suggestions.

I've only tried a few blends so far.  I tried Orlik Golden Sliced and didn't really care for it.  I enjoyed Peter Stokkebye Luxury Bulls Eye Flake quite a bit.  I didn't like the smoky taste of a generic English blend I found locally, nor the ketchup of a Mclelland's bulk Virginia/Perique.

I don't have a clear understanding of what flavors and characteristics correspond to different varieties of tobacco, beyond some basics (e.g. Orlik probably burned hot because it's mostly Virginia, Latakia is smoky), so I'm at a bit of a loss going forward.

Anybody have a suggestion that someone who enjoyed Peter Stokkebye Luxury Bulls Eye Flake and doesn't like smokey Latakia flavors or ketchup might enjoy as well?

edit:  thanks for the suggestions, plenty of good ideas to go on for this restock. :)
