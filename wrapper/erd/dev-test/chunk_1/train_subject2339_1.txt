If we can oust the rogue mod. I would personally volunteer to mod the astrophysics page. I just hate to see some troll take over like that.  
























 Hey I have had an idea, what if every week or every month or something we posted a city or area that we want to map and then everybody works together to map that area for the week.  We can make it fun by taking a before and after screenshot or something.  I just think it would be a fun way to make a lot of progress on specific areas to help and make the map better.  


A lot of times there it just feels like you can map for days and days but not much progress is being made.  I think this would be a fun way to realize a lot of progress in a specific area very quickly, and help keep people enthused.


PS: Please submit your thoughts. 









 A few days ago this ask reddit post asking about divorse made it to the front page. (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2mk3kp/divorced_redditors_why_did_you_get_divorced/)


Here Huffington Post article from 3 days ago literaly going through and copying the top comments.  At least they cited Reddit with hyper links. (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/21/why-people-get-divorced-_n_6200210.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular) 

















































 I have read the osm wiki on it but I still feel like it is a bit vague on when you should use one over the other.  Does anyone have an opinion on which to use, and when? 














 I recently decided to take the leap from the ID editor into JOSM I expected it to be a difficult transition but I didn't expect it to be almost impossible.  I have enjoyed editing in the ID editor, but it does have its moments of frustration,  it lags when you haven't saved for a while, you cant zoom out to get the big picture which can get claustrophobic and make large edits hard to impossible, and it wont load large objects completely, which can get confusing. For all of these reasons I decided it was time to try JOSM.  

I expected things to be different and more complicated, but after finally booting up JOSM and trying it out I have found I have trouble even drawing a simple road, much less getting back to the power editing i am used to.  I cant figure out how to pan the the view and every time i try i just end up drawing a new way.  The list goes on. 

What I have discovered is what I really want is the simplicity of the ID editor paired with the ability of JOSM to edit large areas.
Is there anything like this out there?  

I feel like i am stuck in the middle, where the ID editor is starting to feel confining and limiting, but JOSM is so complicated, that i end up spending 5 minutes just trying to trace a simple road.


Edit: thanks for all the help the shortcuts make a huge difference, thank you for all the help guys. 




 So i am trying to buy a motor and ESC's and it was recomended to me [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/2le7uo/trying_to_build_quad/clu1ha0) to use a motor that has a max draw of around 6-8 amps with a 10 amp esc, you can see the links.  The problem is the ESC's are out of stock.  Is there any problem (besides extra weight) with going with a [20 Amp ESC](http://www.myrcmart.com/rcx-20a-sky-simonk-brushless-esc-for-multicopter-24s-p-8063.html) instead of the recommended [10 Amp ESC](http://www.myrcmart.com/product_info.php?products_id=6994)?


Edit:sorry The motor is this one here http://www.myrcmart.com/zmr-1804-2400kv-micro-outrunner-brushless-motor-clockwise-p-6281.html 




 I am trying to build a quad for as cheap as possible.  I have a 4 channel transmitter and receiver but that is it.  I am wondering what combination of ESC's, motors, and logic boards would be cheapest.  Please be specific I have flown quads and planes before but they have always been RTF or minimal assembly. 



















 So I have been doing a lot of mapping in southern Mexico and Guatemala  There is this one spot of complete forrest, but it is gigantic.  I am wondering how to go about mapping this? one giant polygon? many small polygons?  Are there other options?  As you can see I have already drawn two relatively large polygons.  


Forrest area I am referring to [here](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/16.1448/-91.0193).


Ps: Also if anyone is looking for a project this area is almost completely unmapped. Would love help if anyone is interested. 














 How did you deal with it?


Did it end up breaking you up?


What would you watch out for? 




 For anyone else playing the Volvo Ocean Race Game do you know what the wind change scheduel is?  It seems to be every 12 hours but it seems to be slowly shifting over time. 









 So we know now that comet [Siding Spring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2013_A1) is not going to hit Mars, just give it a close shave.  When it was first discovered though we were not sure. My question is If the comet were to impact Mars how would that affect the two rovers, [Curiosity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_rover) and [Oportunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_rover), that are currently on mars? 














 I just finally updated to .24, and while the new boosters are really cool, they seem like they are just a bit too powerful for the game. What I mean is with my very first rocket I managed to build a single stage to orbit. All I did was put two large fuel tanks and the super powerful quad engine on and tada I made it to orbit with fuel to spare.  That just seems too easy and defeating the purpose of the game. 


Edit: To clarify I am talking about the new super powerful engines and super large tanks not the little white SRB's. 














 So I am mapping in the middle of nowhere in Chiapas Mexico and i come across this little town (http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=17/16.48792/-91.30753) unlike many of the other towns that I have seen in the local area, this one seems to have a cleared out area at the center of the town which looks an awful lot like a runway.  What do you guys think?  Is it a runway?


Edit: (http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=17/16.56118/-91.36165) This is another example this one seems much more likely to be a runway but would like to know for sure before i go runway mapping crazy.


Edit2: Now that I am getting way farther into the back country I am seeing this a lot more.  I am seeing a lot of towns that also don't seem to have any roads leading to them which would make it seem very likely that these are grass runways, which seems to be a common phenomenon in jungle villages of Central and Southern America .


Edit:3 This is a real thing, many central american towns do not have any roads, and their main connection with the outside world is through small bush planes.

 I have seen so many posts where the two different posts are linked to the same content, but one has made the front page while the other has 3 votes.  How is it that links to the same thing can have such different results?

Edit: Example the first two went big

 If you zoom you can see that the whole state of Georgia has been mapped with forrest and farms where the surrounding states are the normal blank color.  http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=8/33.103/-83.647 



















 I have seen it come up a couple times about relations.  I have looked it up(http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:multipolygon), but it still doesn't make sense to me. 









 For people that are from places with stricter islamic law how do you date?  I know some of these countries are pretty restrictive on how males and females are allowed to interact. 









 I have noticed the county line in my area is drawn in the wrong location. About ten years ago the county obtained a significant amount of land moving the boundary 3-4 miles how do we get this changed?

Edit:Here is the county in question http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2528711#map=10/35.7632/-80.7063
Here is a link to how the county should be drawn http://www.co.iredell.nc.us/Departments/Planning/images/officialzoningmapbig.jpg
The south western Corner is obviously different the new county line includes the end of the peninsula. 



































































































 I understand that the computers in an airbus will not let the airplane preform beyond its minimums and maximums for example the computer will not let the plane stall.  I have heard that these computer imposed limits make it so that the pilot can not cross control an airbus i was wondering if this was true? 




 I just watched a movie called The Snow walker, it was a great movie, I would definitely suggest it if you haven't seen it.  
For those that have seen it, what did you guys think, especially about the ending?

[**Warning spoilers**]

I thought the ending was so sad I was wondering what the meaning of her foot steps ending, and the white owl were.  
In my opinion I really wish that they both had made it, it was so sad when she disappeared to die, and the scene of him creating a tomb for her and him putting her things inside, was almost more sad for me than when he couldn't find her. 














 I have seen quite a few videos of kerbals walking around without their helmets.  How do you do this? 










































































 Hello Everyone My friend who is a little person is thinking about taking flight lessons.  I was wondering how he would be able to accommodate for his short stature.  I think the main issue would be reaching the rudder pedals.  Does anybody know what is typical for something like this. 




 Hello I am trying to decide wether to install the Ferram Aerospace Research mod and i was wondering if anybody who had done it before had any opinions what are the advantages, disadvantages, annoying things.  Right now I am running remote tech and Mech Jeb. 









 Hello I am a private pilot and earned my license about 8 months ago, so I am still pretty new.  I was wondering if there were any recourses on the procedure for interacting with class B and C airspace, so I could study.  I have worked with a  control tower before but have not had the chance to go into class B or C space and wanted to study up so I don't screw it up when I do need to fly into controlled space like this. 





























 Ok so yesterday I hit a few caches and found a couple trackables.  Neither were in the inventory of the caches online.  When I went to log them it let me grab the trackable but now it will not let me drop it off it only gives me the option discovered it and write a note when i try to log it.  Anybody know whats going on? 




 I am playing the in career mode and am currently sending some landers to Minmius to get a bunch of science.  The only problem is because Minmius has lower gravity, the thrust to weight ratios change in their SOI.  I have given them very small Engins with low TTWR but I am afraid when I get there the engine might still be too powerful (lowest power setting is still too much).  Is there any way to calculate the change without actually going to Minmius?  Basically TWR of 1 on Kerbal is equal to x TWR on Mun and x TWR on Minmius.  












































 I am in the career mode and currently have a rocket with a very low thrust to weight ratio 1.3-2.5 depending on what stage I'm on.  When this is the case is it better to fly higher than normal (normal = 10,000m) before starting my gravity turn? does it make any difference?
