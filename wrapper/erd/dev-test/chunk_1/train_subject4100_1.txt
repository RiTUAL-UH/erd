 I'm here to answer questions, mainly, but I do want to respond with one thing. Apostasy is something that is not supported anywhere in the Qur'an. What you are getting that fact from is the Hadith. The hadith are scriptures people wrote 200 years after the Prophet Muhammad died, and claimed he said this and that. The specific hadith this is coming from stated that if a muslim deconverts, kill him. 

That'd probably look true, if it didn't contradict the Qur'an itself. In the Quran, it is stated that killing a man is like killing humanity. The only two reasons it is justified in that text is when one is under attack and needs to defend himself, or if the man is causing harm humanity itself, under which a trial needs to be set forth with a judge. 




 Concerning your first link, these articles are mainly going into not what the Qur'an is saying itself, but what Islam itself has said about science, and how people of Islam have committed to modern science. One thing this article does say is that a group of people were saying that studying science from a point of nature leads people astray from 'God's path', which is completely disagreeable by me. reading these articles themselves, you can find that scholars and scriptures in Islamic history have condoned and encouraged to learn more about this universe we live in.

For the second link, I read the criticism of science in the Qur'an,and it all came down to evolution as the argument. This leads back to the book's statement that though life has evolved through natural selection, which is agreed both by modern scientists and the Quran today, humans had their own path of evolution. The criticism here is that the Qur'an is basically preaching Creationism. I don't see this as a case of complete creationism.  




 I do believe in this. I can give the verses from the Qur'an that actually support this statement. The exception was man in this common descent. Humans had their own descent, is what is basically believed by muslims. 




 I believe in evolution, and the fact that Homo Sapiens have indeed changed over time. The timeline in which Adam and Eve existed according to the Qur'an is thousands and thousands of years ago. They definitely did not look the same. The differing part here is that what the Quran states is that humans evolved in their own way. They were the ones who were different, having a conscience and a soul. Hopefully that answered your question. 




 An array of personal experiences and the thought that pretty much anything is just belief when one is something as small in this universe as a human. I chose not to state the fact that God is there and that I need to make sure everyone knows about this, but I chose to believe that it is possible he is there.

And by personal experiences I don't mean seeing Muhammad on my toast or anything. Hope that doesn't throw anyone off. 




 I actually finished the arabic translation of the Qur'an when I was 8, but I don't speak arabic. It's one of the reasons I never truly went tolearn about it in the first place. 




 I'll look into those readings, thanks!


And just out of curiosity, can you lead me somewhere that supports Islamic studies against science? 




 This I agree with. It was something I kept in mind while reading the Qur'an. What it stated in its text was, rather, that the universe itself was created within six days, and no mention of God resting was given, considering the fact that for something to be so divine, it must be perfect in its own way too. Though I think the six days phrase was given to give the people of Muhammad's time an estimate of how long it would take for Him to make something so vast.  




 For clarification, I was referring to the part where God created the earth 6000 years ago, and then put animals on land first. 

EDIT: To make things clear, I get that people are gonna bring up arguments against me, but if that happens, please give me something to argue with. If you disagree with the fact that it is parallell to scientific discoveries, then let me know how. Give context. I'm not downvoting anyone here, but don't take advantage of this and troll around. Let's actually talk. 




 I get what you're saying. But to me, if this is the case, then all religious people can be considered agnostic. They choose to believe in something divine and have their own ways of believing.

However, I also think this can apply to atheists as well. As much as many people can claim to know that there is no god, or a religious person can 'know' there is a god, it is beyond any human's capacity to know the truth. Like Carl Sagan has said, we are nothing but this pale blue dot. We can't ever truly know what caused this universe, but given the evidence and explanations we have, we can make a belief.

Stephen Hawking himself has said that there isn't a necessity for a divine being to have the universe created. A certainty for that, however, is still always debated. 




 Check conundri's comment for the response. 




 In short, yes. I am a religious person, but a big factor I want to highlight is that the main reason I returned to be religious was because the religion itself valued science. Your question's better answered in the response I gave to conundri somewhere in this thread. :) 




 So like I said, being a muslim and not knowing much about its background and logic caused me to look back at religion as a whole, and atheism as well.

I'd find time to try and learn different things and see what I fit with. For example, at a hotel I tried checking out the Bible, which resulted with me stopping after two pages of Genesis. 

As for Islam, I went back and read it's history, read the Qur'an in the many translations I could find. I read annotations, philosophies, and the writings of Islamic scholars. In the end, after choosing that God is real to me, Islam made the most sense for it. I'll answer any questions of the religion itself if you want to go into details.

One big thing, though, was the fact that Islam let me keep my belief in evolution. I was reassured by the fact that Islam was parallel to scientific facts and encouraged studying life straight from the Qur'an itself. 




 Pretty much the story. I've been raised as a Muslim, and had a point in time a year back when I turned agnostic and went into trying to learn everything I could of religious and alternative perspectives on life.

I've been a Redditor for almost a year now, and tend to visit r/atheism quite a bit along with other subs (you guys have my sense of humor). I haven't really seen many religious people having conversations with atheists that are as intellectual as I'd hope for them to be. Maybe I can answer your questions in a clear way considering I've been pretty open with both theist and atheist views. :)

EDIT: It's 12:30 AM here, and I have class in the morning. I promise I'll get to answering questions tomorrow, whenever time allows me to. Thanks to the few who are criticizing in their questions, but debate respectfully!  




 Haha, nah I get it now. I'm just sleepy.

Pretty much, I was 17, and around that age, pretty much everyone starts to question things. When one's learning, his mind is gradually taking in ideas that become more and more unfamiliar with what he's already used to. With me being raised as a Muslim, I never really went into studying other religions, or atheism itself. I'd always see atheism as this 'OMG HOW COULD YOU NOT BELIEVE IN GOD' thing, actually. 

But around that age, it was my turn to start questioning things. I started thinking that if I'm devoting my life to this one religion, I honestly don't know that much about it, and the things around me are making me feel like there might not be a divine being to begin with. At that point, when I wasn't sure, I was an agnostic.

Eventually, I wanted to find a place to settle, whether that be Islam or something else. I researched many sides, and to put it in short, I chose to believe in a god. Once that was over with, I settled at Islam  because it made sense to me.

Hope that answers it! 




 I think I'm doing both that and r/atheism. And I don't exactly get what you're referring to when you say 'why?'..

 Hah, no we've all been in that spot before. It happens with me, no worries. But I've gotten that a lot, that my drawings are really sketchy. In a way, I kind of go for that. I'd like to call it my style. My art teacher would always have to deal with it when we had to do natural, or photographic drawings. 

The whole caption thing isn't the idea of it though. What I'd do with the quote is design it around him. I made it more blank space for that, because otherwise it does look boring. It's more of a part of the sketch,  rather than a caption at the side if you know what I'm trying to get at. Thanks though, man! 




 I actually don't think that highly of it. I started on this thing two hours ago after wanting to do it for so long. This isn't really anything to make me feel like I'm bothering anyone here. You guys *are* the ones that choose what happens. Just downvote it if you think otherwise. 




 That's actually really interesting. 




 I love this one. I thought of it as well. I'm trying to pick out which might be the best. It was between this and the Captain Planet one that I can't decide for now, unless someone gives something different. 




 So I pretty much feel like this guy is about to make history, and I highly, highly respect what he does. I also like drawing. So I decided to put that stuff together. I have his portrait pretty much done (I wish I could have edited a few things, but I do my stuff in pen), but I want to add a quote and design it around the sketch in a way. 

tl;dr: **What's a good quote to design over a sketch of Julian Assange?**

It doesn't really even have to be from him. Anything emphasizing his message can be suitable. One I had in mind was the one from Captain America you guys upvoted a while back:

"When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world - 'No, you move.'"

**Here's the drawing in question. It's a bit high-res so everything's gonna be in too much detail. Sorry!**

 **A Thousand Suns** - Linkin Park


Yeah, I said it. Downvote me. 




 Sharia law has become the cause of some of the worst ways to handle crimes in Islamic countries today. Not for what it stands for, but for what these guys have turned it into. I don't think there is one reasonable Islamic scholar helping countries like Iran out with their ways of law, or otherwise we wouldn't have shit like this happening: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/02/iran-stoning-sakineh-mohammadi-ashtiani
 
So we're gonna have people stoned for adultery, right? Because that's what the hadith, the said spoken words of the prophet Muhammad himself,  say in context to Sharia law? Alright then. Let's play it that way. Hopefully those countries still at least read how to do this whole stoning thing, right? Because what they've done so far is a completely half-assed job so far. Let's check the rules.
 
**1. If there's ever even a case for adultery, then there needs to be *four* witnesses of said case.**
 
But that's completely stupid, isn't it? Why in the world would two people ever have a legit affair in public? Especially in Iran? Oh, they just decided to get shit on in the middle of a public place in one of the most oppressed places in the East? I guess some people do roll that way. Okay, fine. So we have our criminals prosecuted. Let's get to the stoning?
 
**2. Only a sinless man may be the one to throw the stone.**
 
So here's where shit is supposed to go down. Except only someone who isn't guilty of sin themselves are allowed to throw the stone. Which is funny, because I've always thought we all are sinful. Aren't we? Isn't that the point of being human?
 
Damn, why was this stupid law even made? Why was this punishment made if we can't even get through with it? Is a divine being out there really hell bent on having his creations brutally murdered for being unfaithful? 

Or, to take a different way to look at it, was this law really made by a god who instead, made this punishment so hard to get to, that it has even other people look back at themselves before throwing that stone? Was this law simply made to give the human being a look on his own mistakes, before being the judge and executioner of someone else? By doing so, was this punishment even made to never be able to hit the criminals, the adulterers, leaving them to an open path to seek forgiveness?

If the latter, I seriously think it has been used in the wrong ways. From an outside perspective that takes a punishment like this at face value, it is one of the most barbaric rulings mankind has ever set, let alone a god. Then again, law was never made for stupid people. Everything has to be looked into, with detail. The above is the conclusion I came to about this ruling, which for me made it seem like it has reason embedded in it. To me, maybe these laws were set to be granted to a sane, responsible, and intelligent decision maker. I doubt those exist at all in the shithole of governments stationed in the Middle East.
 
So for the guys who control the way Iran works, take a good perspective at the way this whole stoning thing works. I really, really doubt one of you douchebags are completely clean yourselves. If not, I honestly pray you guys end up taking your own lives out of depression because there is absolutely no way you are benefiting life on this earth. If you were gone, life would be better preserved and protected. We are better off without you.
 
And don't call yourselves Muslims either. You guys sucked at that too, and you're making life harder as a Muslim for me.

/I know none of this may even get to the actual leaders. It just helps me focus when I actually direct the thing to the actual people. 




 I completely do. This guy's a great man and I'm glad he's getting attention. All I'm saying is he should have gotten it earlier. Before all this. 




 It is interesting, I agree with that. I guess I just feel irritated that it's when something this intense happens that we all of a sudden give him his spotlight. I would never, ever, ever hear of him like that back before he started hitting headline stories. 




 His legs crossed in the near-last panel just does it for me.  




 I don't understand why we're getting so involved with his past all of a sudden these days. 




 The links are up there now. Thanks, man!

 Once I was walking to my car after working at a studio in school. A cop stopped and started driving idly next to me to ask me what kind of guitar I have. I told him, and he asked me if I know any Johnny Cash, who happens to be one of my idols. We then go off into a conversation that lasted a good five minutes, naming any songs by him, whether I can play them, the AMAZINGNESS of the Walk the Line movie. The cop then wished me a good day and drove off. 

Most of these guys really are just normal people doing what they gotta do. I've got respect. That conversation made my day. 




 This is one of the reasons I love being at UT Dallas. 




 I'm not asking based on an atheistic bias or a religious bias, but if the video concerns the existence of a higher being being responsible for anything at all appearing, watching it makes me instinctively ask how the basic atoms that started this process came to be.
