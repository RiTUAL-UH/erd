 That's it. Cat fur denies all existing physics regarding volume. I'm sure the amount of fur my cat sheds in a month is enough to create whole another cat. 




 I'm a fridge.
I'm okay with this. 




 Pretty ok. My life isn't filled with excitement but I'm appreciated at work and earn enough. I don't have stats to confirm it, but it's probably along or more than the average.  Working abroad though so I miss home a lot.

The last time I heard from my hs friends, the so-called popular girls lived lives I wouldn't envy: gone into drug dealing, had crap jobs, etc. 




 I think you did a good job telling him off. I would have frozen up and just hung up on him. And a few minutes later come up with a long detailed fuck-you. Damn this escalator wit. 




 From what I've heard: "what's wrong with it? It dries anyway." Yeahhh well do you spit in your room then? Ugh. 




 English grammar broken down into formulae and students were asked to identify which formula it was. E.g. A boy runs home = No.1.

Then I moved to Canada and realized no one gives a damn about that kind of stuff. 




 I just watched it again a few minutes ago.

"Become vengeance, David. Become Wrath." 




 Intensity of positive emotions.

When I was looking forward to something I couldn't sleep the night before because I was so excited. When I was happy, I could really feel my heart pumping fast. It is no longer the case. Everything is "meh" to me. I still feel negative emotions to the fullest extent though.

I'm not sure if I can do anything about this. I'm always told to be grateful for what I have but it's very difficult to keep that in mind. 




 Catching the bus to work / home right on time without waiting for too long. 




 And how would that change affect your current life? 




 Wow he does an excellent job! Looks like an interesting movie... What are those horns doing there? 




 About 7 years ago I read from a psych textbook that Russian scientists managed to breed tame foxes. I wonder how that's going? I doubt foxes will become house pets anytime soon but looking at this cutiepie really makes me wish I could pet one! 




 "Hey. Heyyy... Come onnnnn...." XD He is adorable. 




 The last bit put a big smile on my face. Clonk is so endearing! Never thought I'd find a big green orc dude cute (aside from Shrek but he's an ogre) but damn. More please! 




 I chuckle at the thought of him holding in that position while someone took that picture. So cute. Keanu is one of those people who are hot and seem like a great guy to hang out with. Plus he can turn water into wine... Do you even miracle bro? 




 Damn cat. REVEAL YOUR ANTI-AGING SECRETS 




 I hope you allowed them to collect the droppings? It will be good to see the king give  *a crap*  when it comes to the freedom of religion.

I'll see myself out. 




 That is fucking brilliant. I don't use profanity in compliments usually but this is so impressive it must be emphasized with an expletive. I love the use of the colours! Being on mobile I had to look hard for Bender haha. 




 I can't separate Ramsay from wellingtons. Or poached scallops. "It's RAWWWW" 




 As I play the League I've grown to like champs that non-League players wouldn't find cute, like Cho and Kog. Now you made me find Vel'Koz cute. Well done. 




 "You've lured me with a false promise." 




 Oh that's why the gif was a bit gritty. I will look forward to seeing your cat in HD! (What's her name by the way?)

Here's my [Leon](http://imgur.com/5it7hIJ). He will be ten next January. I moved to Asia for work three years ago from Canada and he's stuck by me all these years :) 




 She's beautiful! I love that little bit of tabby stripes on her legs. My cat is a mix of siamese-turkish angora-tabby and he only has very feint stripes on his tail. Looks like your kitty had more blessing! :D Please share more photos when she comes home! 




 This has nothing to do with the racist trp dick in question but I can totally see Homer yelling the townspeople away and then being chased by a pitchfork wielding mob. 




 Is it possible you guys are blood related? Hair-coat colour match! 




 He sounds like a great guy to have around. 




 She could pass for a 2-3 year old. Cats don't seem to age after a certain point! I hope you two spend many hours cuddling up in warm blankets. 




 I would like to delude myself into thinking that Fox only wanted to keep her company until someone came around to help her. :p

I hope she goes to a wonderful home.3 




 Please Anivia. I'm so sick of looking at a frozen chicken when she's supposed to be a majestic cryopheonix 




 Thanks to Fantastic Mr. Fox the movie I think of Bill Murray whenever I see badgers. 




 How do they have that kind of perfectly assigned coat pattern of cute white mittens? I MUST KNOW 




 He can give me a full physical anytime. I think he's qualified.

Also I'd like to bang him. 




 In addition to Ferrous being a beautiful kitty, whoever wrote on that box has excellent handwriting. 




 A guy wearing a tight-fitted classic black suit with a white shirt loosening the collar. 




 Me just found Clonk. Clonk the best. Want more Clonk. 




 "You're carcinogenic."

Applicable to a wide range of situations and qualities. 

 




 There's a wiki article about the Canadian raising that could shed some light on this issue. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_raising

Personally, being a Canadian, I don't really see a whole lot of difference from English in the American midwest.  




 Wow. I mean MAYBE I could understand that this actually took place if the two were in the same place, but calling up the mom when she's at work? This guy is unbelievable. He does give dads a bad name :( I'm hoping he has some redeeming qualities but right now I can't think of one that could work in his favour. 




 So pretty. Jinx looks like she took a chill pill XD Kudos to your talented gf! 




 This reminds me of Baby Blues comics :( I don't know much about child rearing but what I gather from second-hand experience is that it takes a toll on mom especially. Hang in there! Hope you two get some real sleep soon. 




 As opposed to originating from Anglo Canadian provinces. -.- ugh 




 Not sure about the Anglo Canadians claiming poutine as their own but it was my understanding the vast majority of us enjoy the dish. Also isn't it pretty well-known that poutine originates from Quebec? Even the damn name is very French. 




 Look at that face. Just born and looks so zen and enlightened. 




 As someone who had hots for Dr. Grant I appreciate your story. Thanks so much for sharing it in such detail. 




 The shield looks beautiful! Can't wait. 




 I agree. Actually for someone who attends LSE her expressive power is pretty mediocre. 




 Thrillerrrr 




 Someone dipped his face into the ink jar! 




 I'm a big fan of the current Lee Sin portrait so the new update is a bit disappointing for me. The one we have now has a somber tone and his lips are not so thick... 




 Meanwhile I'm sad Zedd is not following the one true master race. Not too late Zedd, come over to the right side. 




 I love how he's standing above Fight Club. "You are not a... special... snowflake... AWW WHO'S A LITTLE CUTIE" 




 White socks3 




 Chris Crocker has been on /r/ladyboners before and we were debating whether his whole "leave Britney alone" thing was sincere or a parody. :p 




 The pro team champs look great! Female Luc looks bad ass too. 




 I'm patching right now and it's so good to hear the rework turned out great! I really like Viktor but I had some trouble dealing a lot of damage with him but it seems like that's the thing of the past now. The old ult was especially frustrating. It was like tickling champions ._. But not the case now it seems! 




 This is some dedication. Awesome job! 




 Didn't know this was coming out! So psyched now. I really want to get a new skin for Karma but frankly I don't like any of the current ones :( Except for the (new) classic. 




 Yeah I listened to it expecting it to be really sweet but then it turned funky. Wasn't prepared for that! 




 From this alone you don't sound like you were being clingy and what you expected was perfectly normal. But I suppose she wasn't looking for a serious relationship? She should've been more tactful in telling you so but I do agree that continuing seeing each other without clarifying het position would be just leading you on. She handled things the wrong way :(

Being a woman who doesn't enjoy casual encounters I don't understand her pov. 




 Watching him eat the burger makes me crave one instantly. 




 You didn't like that episode? I loved the beginning especially complete with the old Windows opening theme. 




 I hope you talk to (or already have) your doctor about it! Certain side effects are unavoidable but things like narcolepsy would basically make going on about a daily routine impossible. 




 Regardless of how much time you spent together breaking up via text messages is a pretty shitty thing to do. I'm sorry you had to go through with it. From what I read I don't know if you guys had any issues or what kind of person she is. So it's a bit difficult to come up with any perspective on that note :(

But know that we're here for you and ready to listen. Break ups suck even if you're the one who initiates them. There's really no way to make the pain subside fast.

I would encourage you to eat something if you can. Perhaps some fruit or cereal?

If you want to tell me more about the relationship or talk about anything else, let me know. 




 Wow I've been feeling the exact same way... It feels like I reached a plateau and am just stuck here... 




 I'm a bit late but Happy Birthday! 




 When will cats tell us the secret to anti-aging?! She's beautiful. 




 So cute that your camera got distracted out of focus? XD

But in all seriousness, thank you for providing a good home for this little cutiepie. I mean, you'll have to give up your ownership to all things that he(she?) likes, but that just comes with being a cat person, amirite? 




 I love the fact that you named your cats Lunchbox and Bento 3 




 Wow congrats! Though I have little knowledge of the condition I'm happy that you're healthier, not to mention looking better! keep it up dude :) 




 Now this wouldn't make sense in most worlds, but this is Skyrim where you can shoot down dragons by shouting at them. Sharpening swords with air isn't all that implausible. 




 Why does that springy thingy in her crotch bother me so much.. 




 ... you were saying? 




 "Hey, I got a busted ass and I see no one kissing it!"

"*exasperated sigh* alright I'm coming..." 




 I personally like S1-3 Zoidberg the best. His first appearance gets me every time. "My mother was a saint! GET OUT" 




 *squeal of joy* look at those pink jelly beans! She's so adorable. Have you named her yet?  




 Being the boring person I am, I'll just put it in my savings account. And then immediately find something to splurge on the very next month, totally invalidating the point of depositing it in the first place! 




 Exactly, one billion dollars. 




 I love how the background is also dark and snowing as if lamenting. So sorry for your loss. Stay strong. 




 Also taking SNRI here. And lost much of my sex drive too :( If your condition is more or less under control with the pills, could you consider decreasing the dosage, or switching to milder alternatives? I used to take citalopram (SSRI) before and that didn't seem to affect my sex drive.

In any case you should really talk to your physician about this if it's a major issue. I don't think many of us here are qualified to talk about the specifics of the meds. 

Good luck! 




 Graduated in 2011, so the memory is more or less fresh.

First off, don't think it's the end of the world and wait for the professor to respond. With any luck, and I find this to be true with most profs, he/she will give you another deadline but with some penalty. That's far better than receiving a zero right? Most profs don't enjoy giving out Fs and they will try to accommodate as long as the student shows the initiative. And I recommend that you disclose your situation (how depression is affecting your life). Some may think this is just laziness/carelessness. It wasn't the case. So unless you're very uncomfortable, telling him/her about your condition would definitely help. If the prof says no and you can't do anything about the essay, you can also ask if there are extra assignments you can hand in.

If all fails? Still, it's not the end of the world. You fucked up, but you can still recuperate. Maybe do better in the exam, or other courses? This may sound too callous, but it really is not the end. Don't worry yourself to death.

As for coping with depression itself: I'm one of the luckier ones that found meds that worked for me. I've talked to counselors a few times but I've found them to be very inefficient. They always told me what I already know. Meds kept me balanced and gave me at least minimum motivation to work on assignments and stuff.

I'm sorry to hear about your friend. I don't know the detail so I'm not sure how to comment on that. :( Talking smack about you to your boyfriend seems like a really shitty thing to do...

But for now your essay situation seems to be the more dire problem, so I hope you get that in order before tackling the friend issue. 

Anyhoo, I hope my comment can give you at least a little bit of courage. Again, it's an obstacle you can handle! PM me if you want to vent. :) 




 I don't know much about art but I really like the colours you used. Especially green. It's something that you wouldn't expect to see in a portrait but it reveals the mood perfectly. Well done. 




 Just reading his comment history makes me sad. I would be angry, but it's too depressing to make me angry. I see he's also posted on white supremacy subreddits. Sigh. Sometimes I fantasize about rounding up all the racist people on earth and putting them in an isolated island... 




 I hope months turn into years. Congrats :) 




 "Dude... I like... totally forget I was doing" 




 Wait... colours in Skyrim? Burn the heretic!! 









 I can't find the link right now and the reverse image search on both Google and Karma Decay shows that it's gone, but there was a photo of a woman wearing an engagement ring in the comment section of another photo. The ring seemed a bit tight for her and everyone was blatantly making a crack at that, or saying how it looked cheap. Someone said something along the line of: "who says you can't buy an engagement ring where you can buy tires?"

Today I logged onto facebook and discovered my friend got engaged on her birthday. I was so psyched. I made an international call to her (I'm working overseas), congratulated her, and we were both so happy. I've known her for a long time and she's such a sweetheart.

I got off the phone and scrolled further down her profile only to see the exact same photo that was ridiculed on Reddit.

That's when I did the reverse image search. It seems like there's no trace of it now for some reason.

I'm very sure it's the exact same photo because it popped up recently and the angle / the shape of the ring -- everything really matches up. 

I really didn't want to upset my friend when she was so happy but I told her about it just so she would increase the privacy setting on her FB and go through the friends list to get rid of people who might do this.

Whoever posted that link in the comment was a friend of my friend. I guess that's what's pissing me off, not so much that it happened on Reddit. I have a vague idea who might have done this based on what my friend told me before but I have no proof. And the link is gone now, for the better or worse.

Sigh. 




 I moved to Asia for work and my cat (9 y/o) is trapped inside a highrise apartment with very little to observe outside. It's been like this for about three years now and I feel so bad. 

He shows little interest when I try to play with him using the "traditional" cat toys. I know he's really bored and would like to bring in another cat, but that's not in the cards right now.

I also tried bringing him outside in a stroller (all sides closed but he can still look outside) but he was very stressed out and would yeowl until I brought him home. Mind you I did this in a residential area with no traffic or loud noises. There were some kids playing about but I always kept them at a safe distance where he wouldn't be subjected to any unwanted attention.

Could someone suggest ways to entertain him? Even though his appetite and weight haven't changed I'm afraid he's depressed. 














 (Or for that matter, any other "deem/consider/perceive" type of verbs)

e.g. "He deemed the policy unfair." vs. "He deemed the policy to be unfair."

I always thought these were interchangeable but perhaps they are not? How are they different exactly? 









 The variation of the main theme + really unsettling, even barbaric tunes when the Wildlings are butchering the Brothers. Every aspect of the episode was superb but I was especially immersed in the music. It almost reminded me of that used back in the Charlton Heston era. Very epic, traditional, and hits right in the nostalgia. Music definitely gave the mammoths and giants the more threatening atmosphere. 









 I've been using Firefox for nearly five years now and all was well and suddenly it reports a certification issue with gmail/google. When I google something I have to add an exception for EVERY SINGLE KEYWORD I type in. For Gmail it doesn't even give me an option to rule it out as an exception.

At first I thought this was Firefox-specific so I tried it again with IE but it has the same issue. I've been checking my mail via phone :( I guess I can make do with it but I don't understand why it's suddenly acting up this way.

Has anyone else had a similar problem? 




 I used to like the Watch Later function. I would add a bunch of videos, sort them to my liking, and add them to a neat little list. It would also show which one I watched so when I went back I could either restart or move onto the next one. 

Now it only has a "remove watched video" function and the ability to leave notes (which makes me wonder just how many people actually use this).

Switching to Google+ is one thing. Now the comment section works fine, it doesn't share everything I write to Google Circle automatically, so I can begrudgingly accept the change.

Why tamper with what already worked fine?

Please, if I'm missing something here and complaining about this because I don't know better, someone let me know. I'd rather admit that I'm an idiot than continue on with this nonsense. 




 I considered posting here when I was feeling particularly low but I always think that there's someone worse off than me and I should buck up. (But I never use this logic on someone else as I hate hearing it from others myself.) Instead I've decided to post some of the things I do when I feel really down in spite of meds. Perhaps it will be of some help to some.

- Watching the Simpsons and Futurama

I find Matt Groening's work incredibly therapeutic. I also watch South Park and Family Guy too but the Simpsons and Futurama have a warm edge that its contemporaries don't really seem to have. Futurama is especially endearing. I watch episodes nonstop and just lose myself in the story and characters. They make jokes that might be considered dumb/outdated by today's standard but that makes it so nostalgic and cozy.

- Reorganizing and cleaning out the desk / closet

Sometimes my mind is off-limits. I can't deal with it. But the physical act of cleaning my room gives me a sensation similar to reorganizing my thoughts. A neater, well-organized room is just a byproduct. I fold my clothes, do laundry, do the vacuum cleaning, etc. I play music I love loudly and focus intensely on cleaning and that only. It's like workout except I'm enjoying it. I wish I loved exercise but I really, really hate it. So much. I could never relate to people's advice on working out for expelling thoughts that get me down. Cleaning is a good substitute I think.



Perhaps hackneyed and worn out ideas, but I thought these may help and that I should just write these down to remind myself again. I'm at work and I can do neither right now. I feel trapped and am forcing myself to smile. I'm on the verge of just giving up but I have to move on. I don't know why I feel this way. I just am. 




 Context: I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was in high school (i.e. 7+ years ago). I was on cytalopram for a while but it didn't do much for me. Luckily about three years ago I found medications that worked for me. The current pills I'm taking are SNRIs, the primary agent being venlafaxine.

Last Monday I was supposed to go see my psychiatrist but I was making an important call during my lunch break and I forgot. I thought to myself: what harm could it do? I had some leftovers from previous appointments and I would only miss a day's worth. How callous I was.

So this is how I felt: sensory overload in every turn.

Every sound delved into my head like a jackhammer. I put on earphones without listening to anything but it didn't do anything. My coworker's keyboard typing which I would normally ignore was so painful that I had to leave the room for a while. Secretaries walking fast-paced here and there hit me like a gong. It resonated within me. They irritated me and numbed me to the core at the same time. I wanted to attack someone.

I turned to work to maintain focus. I work as a translator at a law firm. I usually work on court decisions, briefs, complaints, etc. I'm always fascinated by the stories I read. It lessens the inevitable boredom destined to come with the line of my profession. I picture them in my head and it helps me visualize. Concentrate.

I was assigned to translate a complaint a few days ago so I was working on it. I tried to calm myself as I tried to regain control over my senses and just work. It was okay for a while until I hit the word SUICIDE. A former rep director of a company being sued had committed suicide.

Normally I would just look upon it with some dismay and move on. It's really unfortunate but what can I do?

In this instance I couldn't just move on. My eyes were fixed on the word. I felt like I was about to throw up. I didn't know the person. And yet the word stabbed me and I was left in shock. I wanted to cry.

That was when I decided I couldn't stay in the office. I had taken the meds at that point but it wasn't working fast enough. I had to go home.

I feel better now. I can withstand my surroundings once more. The words don't send me into shock like before.


I thought I'd share this with you while the memory and the sensations are still fresh. My mom always tells me to "will the depression away". I'm not just having a bad day. I can't function without these pills. Call me a weak-willed person if you want. That doesn't change the fact that I'd just crawl into a corner and do nothing without meds. 









 I've seen action figures and plush toys, but these are pretty common throughout any series. 

What kind of novelty items would you like to see for Futurama specifically? (e.g. an F shirt with a fake mutant arm attached?)

I've seen on Reddit someone knitted a Zoidberg mask for their kid for Halloween and would love to own one myself it was for sale.

Other random things: "Nixon 30xx" bumper stickers, Slurm (sans the secret ingredient), Bender's purple camera, a digital photo frame shaped like the What-If machine, Gemerald ring candy 









 I've been seeing him for the last two and a half years now.

I come from a culture where going to university is a norm. If you failed to get post-secondary education, you're deemed as a failure.

I spent the majority of my life in North America and on papers and in my heart I consider myself as a westerner, though I don't look it. I moved to the country I was born in to get a job and I'm living with my parents. I insisted on moving out but they wouldn't let me. They went so far as to say that they would disown me if I did. But I digress...

I'm turning 26 this August and due to the said culture I'm considered a marrying age. But I don't think I'll get married any time soon if ever. If I were back home I might have moved in with this guy but here cohabitation is frowned upon. Big time.

I've been lying to my parents in regards to my relationship with him. I said we broke up and are now just friends. Maybe it's because they suspect something but they still don't like the fact that I stay in touch with him.

It's not like my boyfriend is a socially unacceptable human being. I admit there were some times when I wished he'd studied more, but I've come to accept that I can't rely on romantic relationships to satisfy my intellectual needs. We have fun together and most importantly, when we argue about something and he's at fault, he admits it, apologizes, and tends not to repeat the same mistake. His open mindedness is what won me over in the first place. I come from a drastically different background and he was very accepting.

On the CV he appears to have all things that are considered to be "red flags" in the Asian cultures: had an abusive father, his parents are divorced, he didn't attend university, etc.

I'm having an increasingly difficult time letting my parents see the fact that I'm not looking to get married and I'm just in a stable relationship. And even if I DO end up marrying him, would that be the end of the world? So what if I'm enrolled in a graduate school program and working at the same time, making twice as much as his annual salary? Does that somehow make me a better person? We're compatible and have fun. Our attitudes on important issues are similar. When we have an argument it's a clean fight without emotional scars. Isn't that the most important thing in a relationship?

I feel so cornered. I feel so pressured to break up with him because I don't know how to handle my parents. I don't know whether I want to marry him so I don't even know if I should take a stronger stance on this and force them to accept things as they are. 




 Hi Reddit,

very first post here. I'm in a bit of trouble with my newly purchased BB gun and I was wondering if any of you can help me out.

I just bought a Walther P99Q with metal pellets and I'm moving to South Korea (Seoul) soon. I'm sending most of my bulky stuff via sea, and I thought this would be okay. From my research it seems like it's a definite no-no on flight, be it a check-in or carry-on, but no one has given me an answer about shipping it through, well, a ship. (I know I should've checked this first, but my desire trumped reason... ugh.) 
If it comes to the worst, I guess I'll have to sell it to an acquaintance before I leave. (The store takes no refund. Again, very stupid of me.)

I'm sending it from Vancouver, Canada, to Seoul, ROK. Anyone who knows anything about the customs/security, I'd really appreciate your advice.

*Wow I just mispelled internationally and can't edit the title. Damn.
