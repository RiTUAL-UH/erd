 I looked down at my five dollars and saw the Doctory goodness and just had to make it!

 Im really not familiar with "grades" in America, can someone please tell me how old someone in 9th grade is?

Also, I had a teacher like this in secondary school from year 7 to 9 ish and he was such a racist to this kid (only muslim in class) and it was practically to his face. I guess the kid learnt to just ignore it but because it was our teacher everyone in class was so conflicted. The worst thing about it was that he was our Religeous Education teacher who actually studied to teach history so he was constantly pissed at something. 




 Thats awesome!  




 :D x
