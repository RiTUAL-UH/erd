 These fields are close enough that it seems fairly natural of a progression of interests. I wouldn't worry about coming off as flakey. 




 Still, as far as I can tell, society has become more accepting of stem cell research, or possibly it just got old for their short attention spans. 




 Jenny is the worst. Fuck her. 




 So after reading this my guess is that there's a miscommunication. A quick google search suggests that "phanton traffic jams" really refers to are traffic jams with no obvious cause such as an accident or construction. I can see how someone would interpret that as "really is no reason for it [the traffic jam]" (my "chaos"), while you interpret that differently. I don't thinks there's actually a conflict here. The one thing I will criticize is that your first sentence seems to misconstrue shockwave as a cause of jams (which it can't, no one's saying that is the case) vs as the reason why they persist, though I don't think you mean to. 




 I don't think these explanations are mutually exclusive. The theory of traffic jam as waves requires that the rate of cars entering the back of the shockwave is greater than the rate at which cars leave at the front of the shockwave. Entering is a function of how many people are traveling and increases with number, while leaving is basically a constant, since cars only ever reach and accelerate so fast. If the former is greater than the latter, the shockwave persists, until it gets late enough that cars aren't entering faster than they are exiting. However, if there's no traffic jam, none of the above applies, there's no shockwave to speak of (at least, not yet)--if we all kept it smooth, we'd all get home faster. However, driving is chaotic, and all it takes to trigger the shockwave is someone suddenly breaking. (It's kind've like how water will superboil if there's no nucleation site to trigger a boil). If there are enough people traveling, the shockwave will start to grow; if there aren't, it won't form in the first place. It's a threshold.

That said, maybe you live in like NYC or some other absurdly over dense place where the number of cars entering is completely beyond the maximum flow rate possible by human drivers, in which case it would be oversaturated. 




 ? Ocean waves are destroyed because they hit a boundary and dissipate. There are no front and back boundaries on a high way; traffic jam waves propagate backwards at a slow rate and are only destroyed because eventually the rate of cars coming into the jam drops below a certain threshold. 




 Yup, hunter gatherer cultures are far more egalitarian and while they may have status it's not tied to property. There's no need to write things down when you have oral traditions, no real concept of property, and when you know everyone in your small community. There's no desire to lug around written things when you move around so much and everything you need to know about the wider world is encoded in oral traditions. Writing seems very much a invention that grew out of settlements and the rise of the elite status, who until recently were the sole writers and readers. My hypothesis (which I admit I have not looked into the literature on this) is that writing was invented for accounting (ledgers) with the rise of status, property, and trade, and soon evolved into law (written code of ethics) and scholarly traditions (engineering, philosophy, literature etc). It may in part be related to older clay and drawn artforms. 




 I like this answer, there's no set career track for a (socio-cultural) anthropology major, it's the ability to understand people through their perspective and be able to interpret and communicate another person's experiences that is very valuable. The kind of critical multi-dimensional thinking that comes with anthropological coursework helps deconstruct preconceptions underlying barriers to understanding between peoples. To add to your list, such a mindset can be useful as a medical practitioner in the third-world or who works with immigrant communities (e.g. The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down is a great book on the barriers between medical practitioners and the Hmong diaspora community who had very different mindset on health and illness), in the military to build rapport and understanding with local communities, and I've seen articles about corporate anthropologists who provide insight into the relationships between their types of products and consumers in a changing world. I think it can be very useful when combined with other skill sets and internship/professional experiences. 




 There are plenty of recent papers on the Hadza, just one example. 




 I think within a few hundred years, science will advance far enough that we can use computational tools to beat pathogens faster than they could evolve naturally, to the point that while we may still get new infections (as the diversity of microbes on Earth is incredible), even new pathogens will be rapidly treatable, and there will be very little suffering and death. Our tools will allow us to stay far far ahead of pathogens, while they remain forever limited by the "cost of natural selection"--basically, we automate the evolutionary arms race to our machines without incurring the cost ourselves. The only problem is that that same technology will allow a similar pace of biowarfare (artificial pathogens). 




 Hunter gatherer cultures who lack writing can be quite organized, in an egalitarian sense. Oral tradition is perfectly fine means of sharing knowledge. Non-verbal artwork also.

My guess is that writing had more to do with the rise of private property and governmental/social hierarchies due to settlement resulting in a need for a means of keeping records, ledgers, coded ethics and the like, leading eventually to ancient scholarship. Writing was lik

I don't know anything about this presumed overpopulation. Pre-settlement peoples did not have overpopulation problems; hunter gatherers are population regulated by both social (marital practices, abortion, infanticide) and biological (lactational amenorrhea) factors. 




 Agricultural diets were not necessarily any better than hunter gather diets (which btw still exist, and don't suffer mental issues). Sedentary farming diets are don't have a lot of variety and risk crop failure, leading to malnourishment. We can see cycles of plenty and not in the bone remains of agriculturalists. Hunter gatherers in contrast are better at hedging and migrating in times of need, and are actually more efficient in food labors. The transition is often due to social (status, property) and population factors (the need to intensify food production). 




 Reschedule the second school. 




 The online thing has various reasons, and not insignificantly is the unique demographic and changing relationship between older viewers and content w.r.t. to where they prefer to watch shows, potentially scheduling conflicts, misunderstandings, who knows; whatever the reasons (plural) it's probably more complicated than can be inferred from outside.

Merch I'll give you.

I don't understand why you're implying Korra was cancelled. It was never cancelled. It was always planned to be a 52 episode show ever since around 2012 sometime during book 1 production. Your last two sentences are not relevant to Korra at all. 




 Ice, Fire, Candy, and Slime. 




 Science fantasy. Whatever it is, I bet it'll have huge worldbuilding potential, the creativity and realism they inject in to their settings sets them apart from any other western animation. 




 I don't think that's a problem. There's less incentive for Nick to run the franchise into the ground. That said, *what is your source that Avatar was not profitable*. I call bullshit, you're just guessing.

Also, it's been almost two months since the finale. Can we please just let this rest, these kinds of comments have become a recurring circle jerk. 




 The chances of another series happening was very low. I think the best we can reasonably hope for is that they'll let someone else do Korra comics like they did for ATLA. 




 That's rough buddy.

 The premise of the question is flawed: there's no a priori reason to assume that religion persists due to a evolutionary advantage for the individual. It persists through social, cultural, political, and economic forces. There are however arguments for and against the analogy that religion acts as a cultural virus--it persists not because it confers a fitness advantage to the host, but because it itself is very good at persisting in the population; this is Dawkins "virus of the mind". Criticisms of this cite studies showing that religious people are often happier, e.g. the Amish seem fairly content in their communities. I personally think the two arent mutually exclusive, religion, depending on context and strain can be both pathogenic and mutualistic, depending on the kinds of behaviors it confers as shaped by environmental contexts. At the same time this view understates the use of religion as a political and social weapon, or the vast abilities of the human mind to overinterpret patterns in the world where there may be none, or the inherent biases of people towards the in-group and the need to feel like they belong and not like an outcast.

 Bryan said they used a lot more cgi models in Korra, and that they were very hard yo work on, but he seemed quite satisfied with how they turned put.

 Bryan Konietzko ended up showing about 420 slides (his count) of artwork from all four books. (Phil Rynda who worked on Bill and Mandy, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, and The Lego Movie followed and was also awesome). Most of it was stuff we've already seen in art books, his blog, and at Cons.

Early Lin concept with helmet (iirc). Early Mako variation with ponytail (iirc). Early concept of the work in the book 1 art book where Korra beats up some metalbender cops on the rooftops of republic city. Early Wan concept with a very different look (beard, no spiky hair) and very different cat deer.

Reiterated what we already knew, that they had overseas production problems on Book 2, and thought it was unfortunate that a lot of the great artwork made for Book 2 didn't translate to screen, but that such is what happens in tv animation. Book 3 went a lot better.

Perspective, lighting, perspective, color, perspective. A lot of wonderful bg paintings and expression sheets. 

A lot of the characters were hard for the animators because of how realistic the designs were, a lot of that due to Joaquim (e.g. Tenzin, Bumi, Unalaq, Earth Queen). Minghua was based on a friend (design, not personality).

Bryan jokingly said he regretted that the characters in ATLA had such big heads, thus why The Legend of Korra had a more realistic design. He also joked that it would have been much easier to do both series in the style of Beginnings, despite how unique the style was for those episodes, it was still easier to draw than the rest of Korra (particularly the bg paintings). Compared Beginnings to doing a mini-movie in the middle of the book, though actually it was one of the first things they started working on for book 2.

Some great artwork from book 4 that I hope will be in the book 4 art book. The one that I remember most clearly were some early Prince Wu concepts--he looked VERY different btw, and NOT in a good way (kinda ugly and douchebag looking imo), the final version is much better. Hopefully it will be in the book 4 art book for you all to see =P. 




  could this element be bended(bent?)

That's essentially what Korra did in the finales of book 2 and 4. 




 That's kinda unfair, she learns the ability to see remotely, and that she that her energybending powers is basically limitless.

 Shower thought: Dragons. 














 Rewatching ATLA, I'm struck by how Toph plays a very unique role in Team Avatar. There's no denying, she's one of the strongest benders in either series, invaluable against large enemies and other feats of large-scale bending. Her presence significantly upped the scale of the threats the gaang could face. That also means she has some of the fewest 1v1 matches in the franchise: the Boulder (easy win), Aang (loss), Katara (mud fight, draw), and Bumi in the comics (draw) (edit: and Korra in the swamp (easy win), and Aang again in The Rift, which IIRC was a draw (?)).

She's actually one of the most situationally dependent fighters in the franchise. Take a look at her element matchups. Against earthbenders, she's godly, her innate affinity with the element gives her a hard advantage in the matchup, to the point that only Bumi is a real match. Airbenders, however, are a soft counter, with their ability to keep off the ground. The waterbender matchup is always gonna be the most situation dependent, it depends heavily on the availability of earth and water--in both her 1v1s, it's a mud environment. That said, her airbender 1v1s or waterbender 1v1s could be said to be no more than sparring matches, and she has no 1v1 firebender matches. Speculatively, firebenders keep rooted stances, and Toph defeats Fire Nation soldiers quite easily. Against a master, it's unclear if a master firebender could avoid the same fate, and take advantage of Toph's considerable weaknesses. And she has quite a few weaknesses: she can't swim, she's vulnerable if her feet are burned, and we have no idea how well she can take a physical hit that isn't earth--pretty much everyone else gets hit hard enough at some point to get thrown around (often by Toph), but we don't know how Toph (especially as a 12 year old) would take a heavy hit. I'm guessing chi-blockers could also have an advantage over her. Her portrayal as a fighter is completely different from every other character in either franchise, all of whom at some point face an intense duel. Instead, Toph uniquely specializes in large-scale epic combat. (That said, my comments are mostly about Toph in ATLA, there's less to go on about how Toph was as a metalbending cop, which is a very different style, which brings up the question of whether the metalbender cops we see the series, with their wire acrobatics and airships was something that was only introduced by Lin). 




 I'm interested in opinions and works on how people with utilitarian positions actually apply utilitarianism to the real-world given the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of the consequences of choices. To my limited understanding, when I think of utilitarianism, I think of thought experiments like the trolley problem, but my main criticism with such thought experiments is that they are ideal well-defined problems with definite outcomes. Disregarding the time limitations of the human mind to fully assess a real-world problem of choice in most situations, even if a person had as much time as they needed to make a choice, real-world situations involve uncertainty of utility, and subjective assessments of probabilities, outcomes, consequences etc. Moreover, choices don't exist in a vacuum like thought experiments do. And the real-world scenarios tends to have many many potential choices, with varying degrees of risk all with their own uncertainties. How does the utilitarian reconcile this? 




 Intro: Seeing the list (link below) of top 10 most torrented shows of 2014 (8.1m for GoT at 1st place, and 2.4m for South Park at 10th place), I decided to see how Korra compares.
http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/12/29/game-of-thrones-most-pirated-show/

Methods: I looked through KickAT, using the search term "Korra", looking through the first 4 pages of results ordered by seeds (by then, the number of seeds had dropped from over 2000 to about 200), and summed the number of episode torrents for Book 4 and Book 3 separately.

Results: Book 4 had at least 1.8m episode torrents. Book 3 had at least 450k episode torrents. Assuming I only looked at about 80% of all the downloads (a conservatively high number), I estimate at least 2.2m torrents for Book 4, and 560k torrents for Book 3.

Discussion: My guess is that my Book 3 estimate is actually much too low, since more time has passed since Book 3, and seed number has decayed, it's probably at least 1m if not more, as I can believe it being lower than Book 4 but not by such a huge amount (though being on tv for most of its run probably reduced torrents). Both estimates are probably too low, but I assumed a conservative yield. Regardless, it is very possible that Korra has been torrented more in 2014 than 10th place South Park, though a proper comparison would require applying the above method to those shows as well, and seeing how well the numbers recovered match those given in the article (since I can't reproduce the article's methodology itself). Though it is somewhat an unfair comparison since Book 4 alone had 30% more episodes than South Park, and Book 3 and 4 together had 26 episodes all together, which is many more than most shows air in a year. Nonetheless, my guess is that Korra episodes have been torrented at least 3 million times in the past 6 months since Book 3 aired, which should make it one of the 10 most popular episodes in terms of illegal downloads of 2014, possibly higher than Suits, Vikings, Grey's Anatomy, and Arrow. This is pretty good considering that Korra is freely available to view online without a network or cable subscription on Nick (for most people), and also doesn't include non-torrent illegal streaming, and legal paid streaming distributors like Amazon and iTunes. Nick is probably aware that the show did very well based on Nick.com, Amazon, iTunes, and TV views.

tl;dr Korra was torrented at least 3 million times by a conservative episode between Books 3 and 4, which likely means it was one of the top 10 most torrented shows in 2014. 




 Just noticed the "ba-bi-di-ba-bi-di-ba-bi-di" singing. Anybody know culture this kind of singing is from? 



















 So many characters in both series have been shaped by tragedy in their lives for better or worse. 









 One thing I love about Avatar is how Aang and Korra have learned so much from so many different people.

Aang's masters: Monk Gyatso (airbending), Katara (waterbending), Pakku (waterbending), Toph (earthbending), Zuko (firebending), Jeongjeong (firebending philosophy), Bumi (earthbending philosophy), Iroh (life), Avatar Roku, Avatar Kyoshi, Avatar Kurruk, Avatar Yangchen, Lion Turtle (energybending) = 13 total, Edit: Dragons (firebending), Guru Pathik (chakras) [thanks /u/tiger66261, /u/MelonLooord]

Korra's masters: Tonraq (waterbending, presumably), Tenzin (airbending), Avatar Aang (energybending), Unalaq (spiritbending), Avatar Wan (history of the avatar), Jinora (spirit guide), Iroh (life), Suyin (metalbending), Katara (healing, both waterbending and physical therapy), Toph (spiritual connection, rational acceptance of the past), Zaheer (emotional/spiritual acceptance of the past) = 11 total, + Bolin (proearthbending), and Asami (driving), Edit: Iroh (life) [/u/restinpeace24]

Also notice the following connection about Korra's road to recovery in Book 4:

mind (Toph), body (Katara), and spirit (Zaheer) 




 If Kuvira would to succeed, is Air Temple Island considered part of the URN, or has it always been an independent area right off the coast? 




 Korra: Confronting Zaheer was her last step in self-healing. Now she is both physically and mentally prepared to face her foil, Kuvira, who unfortunately is now at her most dangerous. Zaheer believes completely in Korra's "limitless" potential. I find this intriguing. Either he's saying, Korra, the avatar really is important and you can and will do your job very well (acknowledging his own futility in trying to remove her from the world). Or foreshadows a final growth in power Korra will achieve in response to the superweapon threat--though I hope it's not a deus ex.

Kuvira: Now controls all of the Earth Empire--she values unity and security for her country. Her goal is probably Republic City--I mostly base this off the foreshadowing from the world leader meeting, the pieces (both the United Republic and Fire Nation forces) are on the border. Her actions towards her endgame include creating a spirit weapon, but also acquiring large amounts of metal--Yi was said to have "ore", ZaoFu's dome has been dismantled, a fact Opal references in the sneak peak. What could she possibly want with all the metal? Is the answer as mundane as just supplying her army (I don't think the writers would have mentioned it so many times if it wasn't important), or does the metal itself have a bigger role in... combining with the superweapon... or somehow advancing her endgame. *Maybe a giant ass mech or airship with a spirit laser* (death staresque). Big question, will she die? I say no. If Korra's potential is truly limitless, she'll be able to end things without taking a life. This would also parallel the ATLA finale. Most likely she's captured, or she takes her own life, but Korra won't kill her. Also, we have yet to see her POW camps, which we now know from the sneak peak to be where the Beifongs are captured. but it looks like 

Toph, Opal, Bolin, and Lin are on that.

Asami: Is working with Varrick on a plan to stop Kuvira's superweapon. If Raiko could pick one other genius to help, it would have to be Hiroshi Sato. Is Hiroshi's role this book just to reconcile Asami's relationship, or is there more to that arc? It's possible that he will be offered a path to redemption in helping stop Kuvira, which will close Asami's main arc, that of her relationship with her father, that has been present since book 1. Asami was underdeveloped last book, so it makes sense to give her a small final closing arc.

Bolin and Mako: Bolin's arc this season was learning he was an idiot for following Kuvira, and the path is now open for him regaining Opal's love. His endgame seems to be that he'll succeed, no surprise there.
Mako's an interesting case. I will say Bryke redeemed his character a lot in Book 3, and it doesn't seem they have set him up for much in the way of a character developing arc. Either he stays with Wu (unlikely) or he goes back to being a detective. Other than his current employment, he seems to be at his final destination. He participates in the final confrontation somehow, though at Wu's side, unfortunately.

Wu: Comedy relief, hasn't really grown as a character in NINE episodes. There's some hints (scene at Little Ba Sing Se) that he may learn to become a good leader of his people, but I just can't see him right now being the Earth Empire endgame. That said, Bryke have been known to utilize quite sudden character shifts, and why else would he be a character. On the other hand, he may exist by necessity of the Earth Kingdom needing a monarchial heir for Kuvira to usurp. He could really just be comedic bait and switch. I do find it unlikely that the Earth nation will revert to a Kingdom in the finale, too much has changed. That said, the Fire Nation is still a (now benevolent) monarchy, so I see a few possibilities for what will come out of the Earth Empire. 1) It becomes a (competent) monarchy with Wu as King. 2) A constitutional monarchy with a parliament. 3) A non-monarchy independent democratic nation. 4) Dissolve into independent states. 5) A confederacy of states. 6) Joins the United Republic (far fetched). The impending liberation of Zao Fu probably points at 2-5. Will Su take an active role in government? She has been and still is the only competent potential leader. Maybe in an advisorial role.

Varrick and Zhuli: Zhuli betrays Kuvira somehow, unknown. Or potentially, she backstabs Baltar Jr, likely since she's working with him now--though really, she should have done that before Baltar Jr. figured out how to weaponize the swamp. Varrick realizes his love for Zhuli. What exactly counts as a countermeasure to a superweapon anyways? Asami and Varrick don't exactly have many resources other than... their own spirit vines. Cold war?

Jinora: Hopefully not captured again. Reunion with Kai (where is that little scamp), who's main arc was last book.

Baltar Jr: Dies, hopefully. At least, won't be redeemed.

General Iroh will lead the United Forces in the final confrontation, small cameo. Izumi, Raiko, and Tenzin + Jinora will have their small roles leading their respective factions, but Korra will avert major conflict. I just don't think this book will get that dark, though it will get *worse* in about two episodes.

Kai, Ikki, Meelo, Rohan, Pema, Tonraq, Mako and Bolin's family, Desna, and Eska have had their small roles this season. Bumi and Kya will have a cameo in the epilogue. And Katara and Zuko will have a flirty moment (okay, I don't think we'll actually see them again). Toph will disappear back in the swamp after saying goodbye. 














 It's not actually recent at all.

 Sometime around a year and a half ago we were similarly duped on a large scale. We got the news from the higher-ups that our Book 4 budget was getting slashed, almost to the tune of an entire episodes budget. - Bryan Konietzko

Do you remember what we were doing a year and a half ago? We were still waiting for Book 2 to air. Book 2 was still in post-production, Book 3 in production, and Book 4 was likely in pre-production. This was probably when Bryke was working on 30+ episodes at some stage of production at the same time. This decision came out before any of the public mess with Nick. In any case, I'm glad that Nick decided, with only Book 1 having aired, and having just ordered 3 more books, that in evaluating their budget for the next... year and a half... they only reduced Korra's budget by one episode. It could've been a whole book. I find it amazing that Nick supported the show for 4 whole books since mid 2012, when originally they only ordered 1. Let's remember how excited we were back then. And now we're almost at the end! 





























 Rewatched The Terror Within from Book 3. Dat mole. Maybe it's actually Envy in disguys again guise. 




 Sandbending is probably the least explored type of bending, now that almost every other type has been expanded on Korra (except plantbending). I really wish we got to see more of it, there just seems to be a lot of potential and creativity with a powerful sand bending character, especially if it was easy to compactify and liquefact sand. Similar to lavanending, but more obviously parallel to air and waterbending techniques. Imagine a powerful sandbender arriving in Republic City and just bending all the stone buildings away like they were windy earth, or sinking them into the ground. Or giant sand storms blinding opponents plus seismic sense. Or Kya's water ring form but with sand. Or sand arms. Or sandsurfing. Or landscapes of glass from a sandbender vs firebender fight. Maybe we'll meet Toph this book and she has become a beast at it.

Edit: damn it jumbled up words in title 




 Goddamn it Korra. 




 Korra telling Toph that her daughters have reconciled. I want to know if she blames herself for her family problems, and what her response is to the news. Oh, and to learn that her granddaughter is an airbender. I hope she still has her sense of humor. 














 It's surprisingly hard emotionally to rewatch Korra from the beginning, she's so happy and gung-ho about being the avatar. Also, for anyone who says she's a weak bender, she makes some kick-ass fireblasts in her firebending test. 














 Jinora and Korra already are. Well, Jinora at least gets a tattoo. I think it would be incredibly exciting if they all got new hair styles. Mako also does not have his scarf anymore. If not hair change, at least other major cosmetic changes. The fandom would implode itself if Asami started wearing pigtails. 














 Unalaq: After today there will be no more Water Tribe; no more nations of any kind. The world is about to be transformed into something magnificent, and new. And I will lead this glorious revolution.

Zaheer: Together, we will forge a world without kings and queens, not borders and nations, where Man's only allegiance and those he loves. We will return to the true balance of natural order. And though you'll never again be reborn, your name will echo throughout history: Korra, the last Avatar.

---

However, compare

Unalaq: You think what Avatar Wan did was good? Driving almost all the spirits from this world? The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos. You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds, but there shouldn't be a bridge: we should live together as one.

vs

Korra: But that won't bring balance. It will throw the world into chaos.

Zaheer: Exactly. The natural order is disorder.

---

Btw, speaking of revolutions,

Amon: The revolution has begun!

Unalaq (from above): [...] And I will lead this glorious revolution.

Zaheer: The revolution has already begun! 




 The Ultimatum, Enter the Void, and Venom of the Red Lotus had near perfect 9.9 and 10.0 scores on IMDB the last time I checked them. The last thread to point this out was posted 15 hours ago. In fact, they still do on this page
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1695360/eprate
which is usually slow to be updated (I have archived the page in case it changes).

But if you look at the episodes themselves (click on the link on the above page), all the scores have dropped significantly since that page was last updated. There is evidence of sabotage. A lot of the episodes now have somewhere between 22-24 new 1 ratings that weren't there before. And the female, female 18-29, 30-44 ratings are much lower than their male counterparts, which makes no sense, since this show isn't sexist (edited). The 1 raters seem to be consistently split between about 8 males and about 14 female accounts. 









 We know of three separate plans associated with the Red Lotus.

1. The original plan, according to Zaheer, which involved Unalaq, was to kidnap Korra and train her under the influence of the RL philosophy of "restoring the natural order of disorder." Note that I did not say the philosophy of "anarchy", and I'll discuss why later. There's some possibility that this plan was a lie (since it was never shown), but they did have four members trained in the four elements, so the Korra training part is likely true. Opening the spirit portals and releasing Vaatu was part of their endgame, though what they expected to do afterwards with Vaatu (other than spreading general chaos) and with Korra after she released Vaatu is unknown. All we know is that it did not involve the creation of a dark avatar. However, since Vaatu has to defeat Raava, I'm guessing their plan was to destroy the avatar anyways, but then why train Korra, unless that was a lie? Perhaps Korra must be fully realized to open the spirit portals. Or was their endgame really to take control of the avatar?

2. Once the original plan failed and the RL 4 were captured, Unalaq abandoned the Red Lotus and pursued his own plan, to still get Korra to open the spirit portals and release Vaatu, but now fuse with Vaatu to become a dark avatar, and destroy the avatar--essentially taking control of the role of the avatar for himself. Was this his goal from the beginning? Were the RL 4 betrayed? Or did he just take advantage of the situation in Zaheer's absence to satisfy his own greed in the name of spreading disorder?

3. The new Red Lotus plan. The spirit portals have been opened, but Vaatu has been defeated. The new plan is to destroy the avatar and bring anarchy/disorder to the world by targeting nations and governments themselves in order to empower the individual. This doesn't seem to match the plan to release Vaatu, who doesn't seem to want to empower humans at all, so my guess is that this is Zaheer's personal variation on the Red Lotus philosophy. Possibly, he just really hated prison, and wanted to be free.

Thoughts? 



















 melts the entire base of the mountain on which the Northern Air Temple is built on. It looks like in the finale there will be some kind of confrontation on a rocky lifeless landscape.

edit: w00t! 




 The finale's should have a LOT of characters vs the Red Lotus. Who should battle who? I hope Tonraq fights Ming-Hua. 




 Spirit Bend. If Unalaq could do it, the rest of the Red Lotus probably at least knows about spirit bending. Ming-hua doesn't seem spiritual enough to know how, but it would be cool if she could, and used her water arms to do so. Or if Zaheer could do it with airbending, that would probably look awesome. 




 Unalaq was a part of the Red Lotus, but he was also the head of a nation, how exactly was he supposed to fit into the part of the Red Lotus plan that involved taking out oppressive leaders?  




 A Breath of Fresh Air

Shiro Shinobi; "What other *changes* are in store for our city?"

Jinora to Korra: "You've *changed* the world. We're connected to the spirits again."

Kya to Bumi: "I have been noticing a *change* in your aura lately."

Tenzin to Korra: "You did what you thought was best for the world, and now things have *changed*. *Change* can be good or bad, depending on your point of view."

Korra to Daw: "Look, I know you're scared. You've gone through a big *change* and its kinda my fault."

Tenzin to Daw: "I have never met a new airbender before. Well, at least one whose diapers I didn't have to *change*."

Korra to Raiko: "Listen, I know you're having a tough time getting used to these *changes* and I'm sorry for that,"

Zaheer to Lolguards: "Now you might want to ration that bowl of rice. You've got three weeks till the next shift *change*."

Rebirth

Lolguards: "Finally. Our shift *change* is here."

Tenzin to Not A Happy Farmer: "Well, you're so much more than just a farmer now. Harmonic Convergence *changed* everything."

Kai: "The person who stole that stuff was the old me. Once I got airbending, I *changed*."

Kai: "Woah! Hey, lighten up. I'm turning over a new leaf, making a *change*."

The Earth Queen

Jinora: "Uncle Bumi, you've got to work on your stance *changes*."

Kai: "Keep the *change*. I love Ba Sing Se."

In Harm's Way

The Metal Clan

Aiwei: "I'm a truth seer. When people lie, their heart rate and breathing increase. I can sense the most subtle of *changes*."

Lin to Su: "You haven't *changed* one bit, have you?"

Su: "Ease up, Lin. Sure Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past, but that doesn't mean he should pay for it for the rest of his life. My chef was a pirate, but now he's a culinary master. People *change*."

Korra to Lin: "Su's right. You're never going to *change*. You're always gonna be a bitter, lonely woman."

Old Wounds

Su to Bolin: "Okay, Earth Guy. Well, let me know if you *change* your mind."

Su: "You know what, Lin? You're the one who hasn't *changed*. You're still a bitter loner who only cares about herself. No wonder Tenzin ended things with you years ago." OOO SNAP

Original Airbenders

Yung: "Can I *change* out of my robe now? It's itchy."

The Stakeout

Zaheer: "You're a very smart young woman, Korra. But you must realize that once *change* begins, it cannot be stopped, even by the Avatar."

23 changes in Book 3: Change so far as of Ep 9. Wonder how many "Air" and "Spirits" there are in Book 1 and 2. Needs compilation vid after Book is over.

 Opal is Tenzin's bastard daughter. Sokka is Su Yin's father. And the true leader of the Red Lotus is none other than

Toph "tough" Beifong.

Yes, Toph Beifong. It all makes sense now. Ai Wei saying that she has gone off in search of "enlightenment", much like how Zaheer seeks to "enter the void". That no one has seen her in many many years. That Ai Wei, the traitor, would be the one to admit this information. Why Toph had to protect Su Yin from jail time. It explains the hints that we might see her this season. Why she didn't help capture Zaheer's group 13 years ago, and why she retired from the police force years before that. Why Zaheer's group consists of unique benders, including one that is handicapable, like herself. She is the leader of the Red Lotus. Something happened between her and Aang just before his death. She disappeared from the world and is pulling the strings in the shadows. She is in collusion with Ai Wei, Su Yin, and the creation of Zao Fu is just part of the Red Lotus conspiracy. Opal Beifong is the promised child, Guru Laghima reborn, sent to destroy the unrightgeous of the Northern Air Temple. Toph killed Sokka, who is her baby daddy, because he knew something he shouldn't have. Toph Beifong is the ultimate enemy Korra and the gaang will face at the end of this season. What could probably be more surprising than our own esteemed Toph Beifong being the true antagonist of Book 3? What else could possibly cap off Lin's character development this season more than realizing the monsters that her own sister and mother truly are? Why else would Korra and Bolin need to learn metalbending? Who other than the greatest earthbender who ever lived could possibly be a worthy successor to Book 1's Amon, and Book 2's world ending manifestation of evil itself? Only the blind can see when we enter the Void.

It's the dawning of a new age, and the Blind Bandit will rise again to impose her vision of a new world order on us all. 




 We know Zaheer's the leader of his gang of four, but now with Ai Wei's betrayal, speculations that Su Yin is also involved, and a possible connection to the Earth Queen, it seems possible that the real mastermind behind this Red Lotus conspiracy may not be Zaheer as we thought. Zaheer seems more like a fanatic following a path laid out from him, a master plan of sorts. Ai Wei is intelligent and also looks to be a strong fighter, I wouldn't be surprised if he was the true mastermind or current leader of the conspiracy. I really do hope we get to see him fight. Huo Ting, if she is involved, seems more likely to have joined due to her prejudice against the avatar, her and the Dai Li's motivation seems clear. I doubt at this point the main players in the conspiracy haven't been shown yet, which is one reason I find Ai Wei's reveal to be fascinating. There might be other minor members of the conspiracy to be revealed. Who else might be involved? Raiko? Varrick? MEELO? I feel like this season just imploded in awesomeness.
 









 Was Aang just like gtfo? 




 So we got our evil airbender leader, chaos incarnate, chi-blockers, bloodbenders, and more. Some villains bring in fresh new ideas (Vaatu), others are twists on established concepts in the franchise (Amon). What ideas do you have for awesome final season of Korra villains? 




 Summary: Spirits = Souls. Humans are weak spirits which gain by inhabiting physical bodies. Non physical spirits are strong enough to not need physical bodies. Spirits (and thus humans) die permanently, except when (like horcruxes) a part of them remains somewhere else, and in which case they can revive (that is, they don't really ever reincarnate). When spirits gain physical forms (without killing the host), they become vulnerable to death, as in Raava/Avatar and Unavaatu in the avatar state, AND Yue/the moon spirit/fish, which are the same phenomena. Thus, Unavaatu is perma-dead. Lastly, I briefly talk about how does Korra bend her inner spirit, and what happened when Aang and Raava fuse with the Ocean spirit, with no real answers to these questions.

Long Version: Firstly, "Spirit" and "soul" are indistinguishable. [When Unalaq tries to spirit bend Jinora, he threatens her eternal soul]. Spirits (non-human or animal) as we know them are those which do not inhabit physical bodies. Their spiritual bodies are sufficient to interact with the worlds (both Spiritual and Physical worlds), some seem always solid [most spirits], others can become invisible or visible at will [dragonfly bunnies]. Therefore,

~~~Humans Are Really Spirits. 

Spirits (non-human or animals such as dragons, air bison, and badger-moles) as we know them do not *need* to inhabit physical bodies. The converse is that human spirits must inhabit physical bodies. Human spirits can thus be considered *weak* spirits in this regard. The human being consists of a human spirit (a soul), which is indistinguishable from the self, and which inhabits a physical body, which acts as the medium by which a human spirit can interact with the world(s). They compensate their weakness buy having physical bodies. One advantage of having a physical body is that the body is necessary to bend the elements [disembodied human spirits cannot bend, elemental attacks seem to harm spirits both non-human and human, as when Korra is attacked by Unalaq, or when any spirit is attacked in Book 2].

Most human spirits cannot be separated from their physical bodies (at least until death, see below). Some human beings are sufficiently spiritually inclined that they can leave their physical bodies. As a disembodied human spirit, they can interact in the spirit world (possibly due to its heightened spiritual energy), but not in the physical world, in which they are invisible ghosts [Aang, Book 1]. [The exception which proves the rule is Jinora Book 2, who is visible and can interact in the physical world. The appearances of Avatar Roku at the Winter Solstice and Avatar Kyoshi during her trial are also exceptions which prove the rule]. Moreover, only the sufficiently spiritually inclined can continue to exist as spirits after death [All avatars, the Painted Lady, and Iroh].

There is another reason why human spirits can be considered *weak* spirits, and that is spiritual possession. Spirits (non-human) can possess a human's body [Beginnings, the Avatar, Unavaatu, Yue]. In doing so, the spirit can easily overpower the human's own control over their body, the human body starts to take on characters of the spirit, and the spirit if it remains too long will eventually kill the human body. All of these properties suggest that spirits are *stronger* than the spirit which is the human soul. (Or, it suggests that a physical body rejects a spirit which does not belong and eventually dies). 

~~~Yue/Moon are the same as Avatar/Raava

There are exceptions to the rule that spirit possession kills the human body: 1) a spirit and human can bond using the power of Harmonic Convergence and share a body [The Avatar, Unavaatu]. I claim a second exception: when the moon spirit imbues baby Yue with a part of its life force. Both Yue and the part of the moon spirit which lives within Yue's body without harming her, possibly because neither are particularly strong; Yue's spirit was weak at birth, and the moon spirit only parted with a tiny bit of itself.

I further claim that the bond between the Avatar and Raava and that between Yue and the moon spirit are much the same thing, a mutually beneficial sharing of a physical body. Both get stronger when bonded than when not. Both take on characteristics of the spirit; Yue's hair turns white, the Avatar state, and possibly why Korra could do amazing cosmic things when separated from Raava. A third example can also be said to fit this: Tui and La becoming mortal fishes may very well be another bond between spirit and physical being. Why do I say this? Because while we know Tui and La take on physical forms, we don't know how, and the only way we see this happening elsewhere is when Raava bonds with Wan to become the Avatar, and similar with Unavaatu. It is possible there are other ways a spirit can become physical without bonding with an existing physical being, in that instead perhaps they created or were endowed with physical forms, possibly suggesting that the first animals and humans were also once spirits which gained physical forms. Regardless, one thing seems certain, and that is

~~~Spirits Really Die, They Don't Reincarnate (and Unavaatu is Perma-Dead)

When a spirit becomes physical, it becomes *mortal* (or at least *vulnerable to death*, as I do think spirit bending actually kills spirits, since Korra words imply that it is similar to 'passing on'). Physical beings, like animals and humans, age and die and are mortal. Tui and La's physical forms can be killed. And we know that *if* the avatar is killed in the avatar state, then the avatar spirit will cease to exist; this suggests that Raava could really die permanently if the avatar dies in the avatar state. It is possible that this only means that Raava dies until the next Harmonic Convergence and is reborn in Vaatu. However it is ambiguous, and it makes sense that while Raava and Vaatu cannot die as spirits, by becoming mortal they become vulnerable to permanent death. If we take this as possible, then it is very possible that Vaatu at the bend of Book 2 had been permanently defeated; by bonding with Unalaq and becoming a giant avatar state being, and is permanently gone due to spirit bending. The other implication of this is that Unavaatu was foolish in separating Raava from Korra and killing Raava independently, as that reduced her fate to the case where Raava is a spirit and not vulnerable to permanent death.

What happens after death? There seem to be two possibilities. Reincarnation, and permanent death. The Avatar is said to be reincarnated into the next generation; however, we now know that it is really Raava's essence which survives, and that the human spirit part of the Avatar remains a separate identity which can be communicated with by future avatars by their connection with Raava. Thus, all avatars have separate human souls. That makes sense since Raava is said to be what is is reincarnated, but we don't know if the past avatars are still around now that Korra's connection is broken. Possibly, those avatars are still around, but they are just impossible to reach. Or, they could have 'passed on' when the connection was broken. It is never said that other human souls are reincarnated, only ever the Avatar, i.e. Raava.

Alternatively, all human souls (and spirits as well) are reincarnated in new human bodies (or new spirits) at death, and all avatars share the same soul, but are cognizant of old memories due to Raava. This explains how Raava transfers from one body to the next, by following the reincarnations of Wan. This would mean that breaking the connection to them really means that those past memories of the same soul are no longer available, in the same way that no other human can remember. However, I think this is less likely than that human souls actually pass on in death (except when they transcend into spirits), for the reasons discusses in the previous paragraph. But then, why do Raava and Vaatu remember their past reincarnations even when defeated? Is it because they are powerful spirits?

~~~Some Spirits Basically Use Horcruxes

Or is it because they aren't really destroyed if part of them exists in the other (while *connections* to other Avatar spirits *can* be broken). Instead, they seem to escape death because, when they break apart from each other, they leave a little bit of themselves behind, and in turn, take a bit of the other with them. Like Yin and Yang symbols, literally. This matches what is said in Book 2, that when one defeats the other, they come back in the other. This is an alternative to them being *reincarnated* in the other; instead they were never fully defeated in the first place, because (like horcruxes), in the name of balance, they cannot help but leave a part of themselves in the other. 

If this is the case, then it likely holds in general for spirits. This is similar to how the moon spirit was able to revive; by leaving a part of itself in Yue, the moon spirit was able to escape death, and the bond between Yue's and the old moon spirit become the new moon spirit. There really was a risk of the moon spirit permanently dying, except, there does seem to be an allowance in the avatar universe for prophecy and destiny for the sake of balance: Yue and her father knew her destiny was to become the new moon spirit, so there really wasn't a risk at all. Likewise, the spirits Raava and Vaatu cannot really kill each other, except in the possibility that they are in the avatar state when bonded with a human being. (Bye Vaatu).

Open Questions: How exactly does Korra bend her inner spirit in the Book 2 finale? Going by the above, my best answer is that because of her bond with Raava, she takes on some of Raava's ancient connections to the cosmos.

Open Question: What exactly is happening when Aang (+Raava) joins with the Ocean spirit to defeat the FN fleet? My best answer is that it is similar to spiritual possession (the Ocean spirit was in control), but *weird* since there were three entities in the same place, and there was also the Avatar state power-up going on at the same time.

Open Question: Why does killing the moon spirit stop waterbending and eclipse the moon? How to reconcile needing physical bodies to bend elements and the ocean and moon spirits? Perhaps the moon is the old physical body of the moon spirit which it leaves behind, but is still connected to.

Edit: This was way longer than I thought it would be. Thanks for your time (if anyone reads this)! 




 If either Mako or Asami had been just slightly more careful that day, they might not have ever met. What would have happened to the story? The fire ferrets would never have been sponsored in the tournament. The championship may or may not have happened (though Amon did say "everything's going according to plan" so I'm going to lean on the side of did happen). Mako and Korra would have been together earlier. Mako would not have been such a tool. Korra would never have found out about Hiroshi. This may or may not be bad. Lin's metalbenders would not have been captured. Lin herself would probably still have been head of police. This may have affected her interactions with Tarlok and his taskforce, perhaps not precipitating the events leading to Korra's capture and Yakone realization. Hiroshi's mechatanks would have been revealed during the attack on Republic City, and would have more of an element of surprise. But most importantly, would Asami have joined Team Avatar, or would she have joined her father? Imagine Asami as the corporate businesswoman villain of Book 2, avenging her father, teaming up or competing with Varick. Oh how Korra's heart, bless her, would hurt from her absence. 




 What's your favorite feels moment in ATLA and Korra? I recently rewatched the entire series and was surprised at how many times it made me tearbend. The Tale of Iroh being one of the best, obvi. 




 Armless waterbender = awesome concept.

Armless airbender, earthbender, or firebender = it would've just been bad. 




 Anyone think he could be ex-white lotus? It is an ancient society after all, and Zaheer seems well learned in ancient teachings. It also might provide him a motive for wanting to take down the white lotus and the avatar. 




 So those white lotus guys can just totally metalbend, earthbend, firebend out of that prison. 




 Rewatching ATLA, it didn't occur to me until now that while most other master benders had 1v1 fights, Toph did not (Aang, Zuko, Katara, Azula, Bumi, Ozai, Pakku, Iroh...ish). The closest that comes to mind is her fight in The Blind Bandit, a fight which was entirely in her favor. She almost always played a support role: first scout through seismic sense, incredibly powerful heavy offense and defense, and the ability to affect terrain. She is probably one of the best benders compared on ability to fight many lesser benders at one time, if not the best. Her usefulness in large scale battle cannot be understated. However, I think that 1v1, she'd be at a disadvantage in every matchup except vs earth, in which she's on the same order as Bumi (only Bumi's incredible intelligence, power, and experience can make up for Toph's unparalleled affinity to earth). This realization kinds makes me sad in that we actually never really get to see her fight 1v1 vs any other master bender (not counting her mud fight with Katara). In any case, Toph probably wouldn't win, since while incredibly powerful, she also has the most obvious exploitable vulnerabilities (ground reliance, feet reliance, weak hand to hand combat, physical vulnerability--we never really see her get thrown around like Zuko or Aang) that a master bender of any other element could easily exploit. Though maybe by sheer power and terrain control, she could take her opponent out faster than they can exploit her weaknesses. This gets me thinking, it seems to me that almost every other master bender level character has a decent matchup vs any other element--Toph is unique in that regard, and thus her combat role is treated very differently (in a good way). 




 I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the multiple personality/psycho murderer lore. It's based on some reset silliness that happened at the VERY beginning of the game, before anything actually happened in the game. I'm far more partial to the recent Lovely Sunday artwork.

But the real reason I'm not a fan of the multiple personality/psychomurderer lore is that it's driving attention away from the stream itself. People want a protagonist with personality; that's fine. But a personality disorder is not a personality. It isn't IRL and it isn't in TPP. People want an interesting protagonist for which to ascribe an interesting personal narrative; that is also fine. But how is any kind of narrative going to form if we're ignoring the events in the stream itself?

What ever happened to us having to fight Roxanne nine times?
What ever happened to marill rollout hilarity or PC antics?
What ever happened to our inability to evolve torchic?

Instead of focusing on the developing narrative, we're stuck on this multiple personality/psycho murderer lore. Narrative can only develop by paying attention to what's happening on the stream, it is Pokemon's classic RPG elements + the unpredictability of the stream which generates novel narrative elements. Instead, we've replace developing real personality with a personality disorder, and now A and her 'mons have very little narrative development. Instead of hilarious antics, which was what made TPP so great in the first place, we've replaced that with dark humor and references that have quickly gotten old (A is a psychopath is not funny the umpteenth time without there being actual development on the theme). It doesn't fit into what's happening in the stream, or at least the community has not done a good job incorporating events from the stream. Instead, it's stalling creativity and development, and either it needs to start developing into a actual narrative, or be replaced. (I'm personally partial to the rebellious adventure story of girl and 'mons with occasional craziness reflected by Lovely Sunday, something closer to the in-game narrative of Pokemon). We're stuck making passing references to batman, or mirai nikki, or whatever. Gen I incorporated into it's narrative an utterly ridiculous and hilarious faux mythology from unpredictable in-game events and archetypal biblical stories; Gen II built on that developed characterization based on in-game events, and it worked because ultimately it fit into our destiny of fighting red.

Can we make more artwork and lore based on things happening in the stream, please? Or at least come up with some interest/operations/plans for playing the game itself?
