 this argument needs to stop, i don't think plot holes are real, i don't know what people think plot holes are, i think its one of those bandwagon things people say like "hey they don't like this movie because it has plot holes i hate this movie too because of that" christ "plot holes are defined differently from person to person JUST STOP IT PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the star trek movies are what they are if you see something wrong with the plot TOO BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
