 I still love Lombardi's on Spring Street. 




 I really like your picture. Where's it taken from? 




 The benefit of these being your 1L grades is that you have 2 years to improve before you take the bar exam and start practicing. Your grades are not as terrible as I expected by reading your title but they are also not great. If you are not going to be able to raise them in the upcoming years I recommend getting involved in other activities at your school. Average grades can be offset by moot court participation, clinics, student organizations, etc. Also, depending on which activity or activities you choose, you may get real world experience that your peers won't have. 




 The video is better with the sound off. 




 I agree with you that cops are often dicks but generally for violations arrests you do not spend the night in jail but rather are given a Desk Appearance Ticket (DAT) and told to appear in court a month later. As RuleLawyer said passing drugs is considered sale in NY but marijuana is specifically excluded from the definition of a narcotic or a controlled substance. It is charged differently. Also having weed or any other drug in a baggie is not intent to sell in itself. Police can always find a way to cause people problems but this makes it more difficult for them. 




 There seems to be a lot of confusion here. As of right now if you are found with a small amount of marijuana not in public view it is only a violation. If it is in public view it is a B Misdemeanor. For those of you that think this won't effect the NYPD's policing behavior you may be right but what is important is that it will lessen the effects. For example cops often claim they saw marijuana in public view after they illegally searched someone and found it in their pockets. A common lie is that they saw it in the person's hand and then they put it in their pocket or they threw it on the ground. They also do this when they illegally search cars, the officer will say it was clearly visible in the center console. Now these lies will not benefit them because whether or not it was public view the charge will only be a violation. For those of you that do not know NY law, a violation is not a crime and is sealed from your record after 1 year. 




 He's more than a jerk. He filed false police reports when he faked his own kidnapping and said that transit police were the ones who kidnapped him. He created multiple fake crimes and events to gain publicity. He's a media whore. 




 You do not have a right to withheld convictions or even arrests that were sealed, expunged, dismissed, etc. Most states have an exception that allows the bar access to those cases. And probably the worse thing that can happen is that the bar finds you lied to them on an application for admission. That being said it is very unlikely that something as minor as this, especially considering the low punishment and the rest of your circumstances, will prevent you from going to law school or practicing law. 









 I sympathize with criminal defense attorneys but as a criminal defense attorney I have an obvious bias. 




 The best part of that is when you try to organize it for them and then you get a phone call about how they can't find anything and that you broke their computer.
