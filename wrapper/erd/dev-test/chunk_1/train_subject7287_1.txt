 Do you mean job shadow now? Is there even such a thing as job shadowing at 16? This program allows me automatic acceptance to UCF but I really want to go to MIT or Stanford and I feel that UCF is a considerable step down from those goals. Plus I heard top tier schools like that won't take an AS. 




 Yah it says computer programming and analysis. I know it's pretty obscure. That's why I said it doesn't matter if it transfers. By the time I would finish I would be 18, would anyone even give an 18 year old an internship or higher paying job because I have a degree in computer science vs. math? 




 That's really the problem, I don't know what I want to do. I just want to do something with engineering but I have no idea what type because they are all interesting to me. 




 No, it's to also to do dual enrollment but wouldn't get me a as in programming. My hs only offers up to Calc 2. 




 I'm 16 and about to enter my junior year. My area has a local community college that offers a dual enrollment program. I've already been accepted and had a plan that involved me finishing linear algebra before I graduate (just finished Calc 1 this year) and being done with physics. Then I realized I could get my AS in programming and now I have no idea what to do. Just to let you know, I don't care what is more transferable for when I go to a four year college.
