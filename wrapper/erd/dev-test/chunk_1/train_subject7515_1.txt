 Title says it all. No harm in 3 years aside from punching the occasional wall, but compared to the hundreds of previous cuts I'll call that good. Even got better without the family ever knowing it was a problem. But I'm worse than ever before. Went off to grad school. In less than a year it sucked all the life from me. The hidden self hatred is like an exposed nerve without anything pleasurable to cover it up. Between my awful grades, disappointed professor, lack of any friends in a 75 mile radius, and lack of any romantic connections I'm losing my mind. I'm slowly driving my only true friend away via text because there's only so long s person can put up with this shit. Tonight I snapped a door off my kitchen cabinet and shattered  my mirror. I'm not angry at anyone but myself. I'm constantly angry at myself, screaming at me when no one else is around because just... Everything. I want to cut so badly but knowing I can't let myself just makes it even worse, like a firework in a tin can. I'm trying to hold on but damn... It's like my own mind is consciously trying to kill me and that's what drives me mad. It's conscious decisions, not blind impulse. Conscious decisions  I know I'll regret but feel compelled to do anyway. 




 I'm there right now. At my school, 4 grades below B- and you're out. I've got 4 now. Makes it damn hard to focus on my research and I'm drinking way more than I should be. I'm going back and forth between wall punching mad at myself and just... empty.

Hang in there, you aren't the only one lost in limbo. But I will tell you this. I'm working here until they kick me off the campus. Do what you can, and don't let it kill ya 




 No. I'm not asking for sympathy or I wouldn't have used a burner account. You can tell me I'm a piece of shit, should drop out and be a fry cook, or put a fucking bullet in my skull for all I care actually.

I came here to vent because I'm alone in this city and I'm tired of putting my fist through the wall when I hate myself. Noone said you have to listen or care. 




 I lied, he wasn't disappointed, apparently the reason he hung up is because "he is so mad that he isn't mad". Also he told the other students last night on the phone with them that "it doesn't look good for me", so we will see what happens... 




 burner account is obviously a burner

So I'm an engineering grad from a physics background, and was convinced, against the suggestion of the professor teaching the course, to take a strictly engineer type course my first year here. NEedless to say it was going awfully, but the department decided not to let me drop without revoking my TA, so again under the advice of my advisor, I pushed on. I'm not sure if it's the ADHD or if I'm just fucking stupid, but despite throwing myself at the class and focusing solely on the class, I bombed the fuck out of the final.

My advisor just called (it's 11pm) to ask how my exam went, and when I told him that I did better than the midterm but not nearly as well as I hoped, he didn't take it well. Instead of being his normal "swear at you and question your manhood" self, he just got quiet, and hung up on me.

I gave it everything I had, but after weeks of studying and a hell of a mental breakdown last night, it just wasn't enough. I don't know if I'm just too fucking stupid, or if I'm willfully trying to screw myself over, but my advisor's voice had that "you could die for all I care, I'm disappointing and I'm done with you" tone to it, and if I didn't hate myself before well after two semesters of this I sure as fuck sake do now.


Sorry, rant over.
