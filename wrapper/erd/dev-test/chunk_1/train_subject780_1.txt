 "turkey boob"

now inserting into local lexicon. 




 True Story - go hitup Blue Ribbon Q in Newtown (or Watertown ? Can't remember) Mass right off the turnpike.  Great true q in Massachusets, I swear.  Better than some 'famous' places down south. 




 Amen Good, real, smoke BBQ is BBQ whether north, south, east or west.  I'd want to qualify that as true q though, cause up here in the Mid Atlantic there's a whole lotta people brainwashed into thinking that if it's meat served with corn syrup glopped all over it then it's q.
 




 Man that looks absolutely fantastic.  Good thing I just ate or I'd really be starving.  I love a good hot pastrami on rye, but never thought about making my own.   I may have to give this a go sometime.  




 they aren't exclusive ! Believe it or not there are people of both the pastrami and the corned beef persuasions. LoL.  




 Until the lady at the very end, I was 100% certain this was a parody commercial. 




 just got this.  Id been looking at wind shirts/jackets all winter, but wasn't about to pay "Big R" prices on them.  Dropped in at a local Sports Authority and found one on clearance for about 20 bucks. 

it's basically a windblock layer with a dwr, ultra light and compact, so perfect for running with in winter/shoulder season weather; work up a sweat, then when you stop throw this one to avoid freezing.  or use as a shell on a misty windy day at summit.   only dwr though, not an actual hard shell.   




 I think I'm going to go pitch a hammock at the school playground until I get thrown out. 




 True story.  When I was in high school my Dad bought me an EMS book bag.  Years the zipper stitching finally gave, I took it to a store, they sent it in and replaced it.  At the time the bookback was probably somewhere between 15 and 20 years old. 

I have absolutely no reservations about EMS standing behind their products.  




 I picked up a Rippack backpack at my local Eddie Bauer after checking out the Flash 22. Same idea - super light, "perfect size", except cheaper. I think I got mine for half the price of a Flash, and I much prefer the looks of it as well.     




 That's why you never look at "percent discounted".  It's all bullshit.   




 I've been really impressed by Dobbin Auto recently.  I took a chance having a new car and having used specialists for my previous car, and I'm glad I took the chance on them.  I actually just had some mail order winters installed by them and was really surprised at how reasonably priced and service oriented they were. The tire co shipped the wrong lug nut key, and Dobbin actually lent me theirs to hold on to until a new one was shipped.   




 I had a less than good experience with them, including bill padding.  




 It's just absurd this is even an issue.  I'm ashamed our state politicians are even wasting air on it.   




 Ah geez, thanks for the reminder. 




  I can bring way more than I need (like delicious, heavy goodies, beer, burgers

Wow, that's some pretty awesome backpacking ! 




 Yes, sorry about the mix up.   It  just says "Osprey" on the bag and my memory wasn't helping. 

 Hip belt pockets are handy to hold snacks, camera, sunblock, and various goodies you'll need often. 

Ive been thinking about this. If nothing else, having my compass there would be very handy, and my phone as well actually since I typically map and take photos with it (and a big external battery pack).    I usually just carry these things in my pockets, but there HAVE been times when I start  to do a scramble and have to stop and think about where my phone is and whether it's going to fall out. 

[What i mean by the exterior water pockets](http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/detail-pages/B00AOICPE2-1.jpg)

I think unless a sleeping bag compartment is very waterproofed or has some other really unique thing about it beyond just the zipper, than it's really just a zipper access.  Which, frankly, the more I think about the more I like.  In my "bring the kitchen sink just in case" days I would have so much crap in like my 90l bag that getting to stuff could be a pain.   However, I'm very, very quickly getting out of that mentality, so I'm still going to think about that one. 

I use air mattresses.  Really need to.  Did foam pads for a very long time and just can't do them anymore. 

thank you !

 




 Lucky.  




 I have that kind of bag - the ginormous, bombproof super poofy belted bag.  It's awesome, but it weighs a ton compared to newer smaller bags which is why I'm looking. 




 Thank you /!  Sorry, I was wrong, my existing bag is a Variant 55, not an Atmos.  I had to dig up the original tag with the sticker to figure that out.   I'm really, really enjoying it so far and can't wait to actually go climbing with it !! 

I appreciate your rundown on the features you use.  Sounds like I may definitely enjoy a smaller bag for little day trips, and that trekking pole attachment sounds worth while.

By "exterior water pocket" I don't mean a slab/shovel/shove pocket on the rear of the pack. Some backpacks are now featuring the same old large pockets for water bladders, but now instead of putting them inside the main compartment they are putting them outside of the main compartment, in the harness area so that you can more easily get to it.  I sense that it makes refilling a LOT easier, and may also save some  main compartment space, and I like the idea of not carrying water in my main compartment space.

Thank you for your feedback it really helps.  
 




 Sorry, my bad.  It's a Variant 55.  I had to go dig up the original hang tag ... definitely a climbing bag, plenty of loops for hardware, and some nice axe straps.    




 Don't know if subaru's come this way, or if previous owner did this,b but my rear wiper use a roc lock 3 attachment.  Actually looks like a great attachment and really does go on and off easier than a pin/hook type except .... except .... apparently NOBODY carries blades for this retail, and plenty of manufacturers don't even have blades for it.  

Should I just replace the arm with a normal one, or is there some reason this would have a roc lock on the back but not the fronts ?  




 no fucking way.  




 how are these different from freezer bags ? just stronger or something?  




 Looks like a ruck glued onto a drag bag.  Wouldn't it make more sense to attach the rifle to outside portion of the bag, so that you could have a more anatomical harness system ? Also wonder if the weight of the bag leveraging into the rifle may cause discomfort, like pressing the rifle into the back of your legs, etc.  




 NFW. That's amazing.  And a physical security nightmare.
 




 do sleeping bag burritos work ? I've been told they don't ... although oddly the same folk told me to buy a liner ...  




 So, I'd figure out the real temperature youneed.  There can be a big price difference between a 20 and a zero.  I've done 5 degrees in a non-zero bag (it's a "10" that's actually EN rated 6 for men). If it gets to 20 degrees, I'd use a REAL 20 degree bag (EN rated, no Big Agnes or any other exagerators) and then just carry clothing  (ie a base layer) or a liner to accomodate any freak swings.  

The EN ratings are also for sleeping comfort, and their actual "surviving, but not sleeping anymore" temps are way, way lower.  So it's not like if you have a proper 20 and it dips to 10 you're going to die.  It means you put in the liner and continue sleeping in the buff, or perhaps you add a base or thermals. 

The key though is only buying an EN rated bag. Anything else is subject to a lot of bullshit, even these days.   




 -External frame backpack.  The type with the large flap covering.  Steel tube frame, preferrably heavy as hell. 
- A steel mess kit.
-Big round steel  canteen with a canvas cover and neck strap.  
- Items made of leather and canvas duck.  I've seen very stylish, anachronistic "bushcraft" gear like this.  Completely useless in terms of modern performance, but definitely old school cool. 

Searching "hiking in the 1950's" on Bing suggests you should also buy a bra.  Google returns less Marilyn focused results though. Odd. 




 So I took a chance on an Opsrey Variant 52 (climbing optimizied) that was on sale and finally gave it a proper breaking in.  LOVE it.  Now have absolutely no qualms about spending good money on a high end pack.  I get it now.

Thing is, this bag is optimized for climbing.  I do climb, but I do alot more 4 season day hiking, and hope to do more single night backpacks as well, perhaps with the occasional double overnight. 

Yesterday I noticed that even with my bag completely tightened up, it was pretty roomy. Another dude had a 33 liter and didn't even seem to fill that and it was a pretty rough hike. So I'm really thinking that while the 65 climber bag was a good way to test the waters, long term I'd be better off with a different bag ? 

Like should I swap this one, or perhaps keep it for when I need the size (backpacking, cold winter hikes when I want 40 layers with me, hiking with the kids, actually climbing etc) and maybe get an additional one ?  So I'm wondering: 

- Does having say a 24 or 33 for a day hike make anything easier ? Guessing they may be lighter ? 
- Has anyone used those trekking pole keepers  on the Osprey - theones that keep them parked under your arm ? I played with them in the store but can't quite get the feel for them.  Do they really let you transition to /from poles without mssing a step ? Or can you just as easily take the pack off, tie in the poles and put it back on ? 
- Sleeping bag compartments - a benefit ? My old bag had one, and it was heavier duty material so as to be more water resistant and prevent puncturing if I threw/sat on my pack. 
- Exterior water pouch slab.  This actually seems to make a lot of sense to me.  I was never really that jazzed about keeping a 3 liter water ballon inside my pack. 
- Pockets on the waist belt.  I have a gut.  I can't really see those pockets anyhow. Some of them seem to be really far back and difficult to access anyhow.  I still can't figure out if these are really nice,or just a gimmick.  I usually have pockets. 
- Bed roll straps on the bottom - seems like a nice way to save room by lashing the tent, or even the sleeping bag.  Truly useful ? 

thanks people.

EDIT: Sorry, originally I said I had an Atmos 65.  I was wrong.  It's a Variant 52... I had to dig up the original hang tags to figure that out.  I'm sorry for the confusion, thanks for everyone's patience. 




 That's absurd.  Everyone knows anything from Land's End or LL Bean isn't real technical gear that can be used for any outdoor activity.  You have to go to an outdoors store and spend 4 times as much for the same thing before it's good for outdoors use. 

I hope the facetiousness came through that well enough. I have a cheap (ie sub 50 dollar) LL Bean down puffy coat that I've had so long I can't even remember when I got it.... thinking about 8 years now, and it still beats the heck out of these wimpy, ridiculously over priced "light weight sweaters" they're selling in the stores.

And looks like Lands End is dumping their winter gear, making for some stupid good deals on jackets. 

 




 THIS.  I'm stunned how  many people don't buy the right clothes because all they see everywhere is the Gucci labels shoved down their throats at ridiculous prices.   Some of the best gear I have has come from Walmart.  Literally.  




 All the trucker's caps I've seen use plastic for the mesh.  Besides, if you don't get some fancy logo or band name on it, it should be pretty  cheap. 




 Even good ones ? I haven't toaken my new Nokian's on a rink yet, but I've definitely been on some ice with them.  They have plastic aggregate embedded in them. 




 yep, I didn't have a problem in the snow untril I tried snow tires and realized how much better it can be.  And these Nokian's didn't cost any more than any other good tire.  




 Never thought of that.  I'll have to try that technique.  




 I go to a super cheap gym that everyone makes fun of, and everyone there is  awesome.  everything wiped down in between, even when you're like "don't sweat it I'm good" they're like "it'll only take a second",  weights always put away.  I think the customers of the gym make more difference than the gym itself.  




 Yep, just did. Giant difference. AWD is completley overhyped ... even my dealership still says on their website "and with all wheel drive your wheels will stay glued to the road !" That's complete bullshit.  With AWD, all wheels will spin, that's all.  The entire rest of the difference is in maintaining traction.   AWD alone just seems to make it easier to mount obstacle and get out of mud/snow pits, etc. But definitely not to stop or turn. 

Good winter tires, however, make tracking, cornering and stopping more effective.  I just got some Nokian Hakka R2's puton my Sub right before about 10 inches of snow, and the difference is definite and obvious.  Not PERFECT - it doesn't make driving in snow and ice like driving on dry asphalt, but the first thing I noticed is that I could now STOP.   On my all seasons, driving to the mechanic, I had to slow for a turn into his driveway and slid about 50 feet with traction control bumping the whole time - basically a total loss of traction. With the hakka's, however, I can actually *slam* on the brakes at a low speed, and do a nice controlled longer distance brake at higher speeds with no loss of traction.  

So while others have pointed out that perhaps this article doesn't bring the proofs, I'd still generally agree with it's point - that it's the tires that make the difference, not awd or 4wd, when it comes to winter driving.  

 




 that helps !  




 march to april is exactly what I'm thinking. even late march you can get a snap freeze here in central MD.  




 lol. well, bring an umbrella if you don't want it to rain right?  I was lucky enough to get them just in time for what is probably goingto be our last big snow (unfortunately) 




 hmm, calling the land mgr is  a good idea. thanks !  




 I shall call them "Hakka" then :)   Unfortunately where i live we aren't allowed to use studded or spiked tires, so these are the closest I can get.  




 Yeah, we're already going into full melt here in central Md.  I HATE the melt.  I'd much rather just have freezing cold and snow.... so few people understand this though.    




 I can't even tell what happened there.   The camera must have been tilted, because it looked like (s)he slid sideways on a flat surface.   I'm guessing those were all season tires, because honestly that snow and terrain didn't look at all challenging ( just got some Nokians and having fun being unstoppable for a bit ;)  









 I love snow camping, and even snow hiking.  I recently equipped for snow fun, with crampons and some killer tires on the Subie.  

I haven't been to MNF in 20 years .... how bad an idea would Spruce Knob or other easy trails on the Monongahela be this weekend for a man and his faithful dog ?   My friends aren't as adventurous as I so I'm stuck solo.   Thinking an overnight backpack or car camp.   









 Hello, 

Getting some winters for my Subie.  I haven't had this car long and this would be my first real shadetree work with it (aside from oil).   Can anyone recommend the best TPMS activation and registration kit for Subaru ? I know with VW's there's a very specific ODB computer software that's highly recommended, but I don't know if there's one for Sub's.  I'll need to activate my sensors to get their serials, and then register them with the system.  

OR, will the ECU remember two sets of sensors so I don't have to register with each change of wheels ?

Thanks !  




 I heard that some Tire shops will let you rent space to keep your seasonal tires when you aren't using them.   I'm guessing this is probably in much cooler states than Maryland ... anyone ever hear of that here ?  




 I want some R2's for my Subaru, but the closet location on the dealer list is 75 miles away.  Surprisingly they don't list a single dealer in my State. 

For those of you driving Nokian's, how did you get them ? Mail order ? Or just lucky enough to have a local dealer ? 
 




 Got caught in the snow trying to get out of town last Saturday.  Columbia was a complete mess, took forever to get out of Howard C and never saw a plow.  Every other county the roads were nicely cleared and plenty of plows everywhere. 

Still trying to figure that one out.  Did Howard even try or was Columbia hit harder than adjoining towns ?  




 I see the sidebar recommends PayPal, but I'm not even sure what protections that in particular offers.  What are the accepted best practices for trading here so that the seller and buyer are both protected ?  




 Me again, the guy with the Subaru Rack.  Here's Part Tow.  Not a typo ;)  Well okay, Part TWO since I didn't ACTUALLY have to tow it, I managed to limp it in, but it was a scary limp. 

So, I get the rack replaced by local indie shop.  Great service, they do it same day.   Reasonably priced, I"m super happy to have it in time for a trip.  Life is good. 

Drive around town that evening doing some errands.  Next morning load it up, hit the highway, suddenly starts swerving left and right when I get it beyond a certain speed (around 55ish).   If I slow it down, it's okay.  

Limped it back to the shopw, we move everything to a buddy's car and go about out trip.  Come Monday, mechanic says he can't reproduce the swerving.  I test drive it with him, sure enough, it's gone.  

He does say that they had accidentally put power steering flud in, but the Cardone's take hydraulic fluid so they changed it out.  Today he's replacing the rack witht a "new Cardone one" just in case it was something in the rack like a bad seal.  Apparently the rack's dont have any way of leak down testing the interior seals. 

Here's the thing, I KNOW it was swerving.  It happened multiple times, it wasn't snow or wind.  It was obvious, and pronouced and clearly a car problem.   Would changing the oil out have that big a change ?  Or could a rack have an intermittent issue like that ? 

Thanks again guys and gals. 

Edit: Sorry, forgot this is a 2009 Subaru Outback with 121k.     




 hating life right now and feel like I can't win at losin, cause of course this issue's been nagging at me for months now, but by the time I made it in, 2,000 miles out of warranty. ... So typical.  

So, my 2009 Outback steering rack is leaking. Dealer says 1500 to replace, they can only replace with new parts.  Nothing against this dealer; they actually seem like a good group of folks, but that seems like good money after bad.   The car has 121k on it already ... should I call around and look for someone who's install a reman'd one instead ?  I figure it could be half price.   Still painful, but at least a kick right to the nuts. 

your thoughts ? thanks guys.

Edit: Hey guys, thanks for all the help.  I got it fixed today by a new indie (that I was really very, very pleasantly surprised by).   I just need the car for a planned trip on Saturday and also need the wife to be able to use it, so I was in a bit of a bind. 

I don't know what brand they used, didn't see those comments until just now, but they were literally half the price of the dealer.  THe car has over 120 on it, so if I get 50k out of it I think I'll be doing pretty well eh. 

But yeah, honestly, now that the honeymoon is over I'm pretty meh toward the car.  I used to drive a VW TDI and despite some of the maintenance pains of that (dsg fluid change,ftw ! ) it really drove and handled very nicely even at high mileage.  

But hey seriously thanks alot guys, I really appreciate the advice.  









 I'm experimenting with some bags trying to figure out what's working and what isn't.   Using liners, bags inside a bag etc I can get my core and legs comfortable no problem, but my feet are forever cold. 

I'm not aware of having any circulatory, metabolic or neural issues. 

Are down booties the solution here, or do I really need to stop messing around with bags that are not EN rated and trying to make them work, and just drop the dime to get a high quality rated bag that really is comfort to zero, or comfort to five etc ? 

Edit, forgot to mention, I wore wool socks all last night, but even made a point of putting on large ones that are not particularly elasticy or compressive.  DID have thermal tops and bottoms on, so my core and legs had an advantage, and went to "bed" fully dressed, thermals, pants, thermals, shirt, fleece but on my footsies just the wool socks. REALLY trying to find a winter combination that works. I thought buying this Lost Ranger ("15") was the trick but it isn't.  




 Going car camping with some friends next week.  I have a propane stove, but nothing for cooking over the campfire.  Like those tripods with the chains that hold a grill.  I've seen pictures of like a coffee pot brewing over the campfire, dutch ovens, etc.   It does look homy, but I've only ever cooked on a propane stove.   

Is the "campfire" experience really worth all the added kit ?  




 REI's having a clothing sale, and there's some midweight Capilene for sale. I was thinking this may be good for the remaining winter. 

Right now for a winter base I use some generic Champion brand quick dry leggings.  Does the job, they're thin though.  

I also have some old school white cotton waffle thermals.  Other than the obvious issues of cotton, any idea how capilene would compare to them, or the Champion leggings ? 
 




 I love my Vomero 9's but I reserve them just for running.   

Can anyone recommend a good Nike for  NOT running, just for walking, errands, daily stuff ?  I had previously been running in some 50 dollar "Downshifts" that fell apart, and learned that not all Nike's are quality. 

thanks ! 

 




 Been having an unseasonably warm winter, and decided to buy some new gear in hopes of going out this weekend.  May have picked the wrong weekend, cold snap moving in with lows expected at 12 deg F.   Have a Lost Ranger and a Nemo Cosmo on the way now, and plan on testing it out in the backward before wandering with them. Think that bag/pad combo will suffice if I wear thermals, socks, hat, and a down coat ? Can also add insulated ski pants and insulated boots if need be. 


Would be a single overnight, either in an open car camping spot, or in an AT 3 walled/overhead shelter.  Tent is 2 walled. 

 




 Baked ziti she said  when I rang her.   No need to pick anything up, it will be ready when I get home.  Except it isn't.  It's some sort of whole grain pasta that tastes like wrong. And low calorie, low fat cheese.   

So here I am at /r/food pretending I'm in a Norwegian burger joint.  




 TLDR: Bought first ever fancy sneakers, paid a ton, 4 months of being pampered across a mere 17 visits to the gym and they're falling apart. Wondering if all  Nike's are this undurable.

The long: 

Pretty much like the title says. My whole life I've kept it on the cheap buying clearance sneaks from discounters.  Finally venture out and buy some Nikes since I reason "If I'm going to start running, I should probably get some better quality shoes". 

That was exactly 17 trips, guesstimating about 45 miles, 51 total gym hours ago.  The shoes are used for exactly one thing, and one thing only: the gym.  They go to the gym in the gym bag, them come home in the gym bag, and they've never seen a sidewalk or a lawn. I don't even wear them around the house. 

One of them has developed frayed stitching on both the medial and lateral sides, and is now separating at a seam.

Are they all this bad  ?  




 This is essentially my next post in a series of "trying to resume backpacking after years of Dad'ing".   It's amazing how time gets away from you.   All my awesome gear that was so top of the line when I bought it, now it just makes me feel so old...

I found my old filter, a Pur Scout.  You know the one, grey plastic with a gloriously turqoise accents, just like my tent.  Oddly enough also just like my master bathroom before I rebuilt it, so it must have been a 60's thing before it was a 90's thing.   

This is a glass fiber filter to .3 micron's.  It USED to be iodine impregnated for an attempt at killing viruses.  Pumps water just fine.  Housing in great shape, the filter itself is physically "to the eye" clean, zero effort pumping, no smells, no slimes, no obvious indications of issue.   Sadly I probably only ever pumped maybe 20 liters through it over the years, it's aging is all shelf life. 

Think I can still use it ? Aside from the iodine, I can't find any reference to a shelf life on them.   

The new Katadyn's are also glass fiber, also .3 micron's.  They offer a few functional differences (like more easily detached tubes) but the filtering capabilities look identical.  

Any advice on whether I can chug away with my existing filter, if I should find a replacement cartridge for it (they DO exist) or if there's really any reason to I haven't identified to upgrade to a new one?   

Gracias mi amigos. 




 I've done my homework.  If I missed this somewhere just point me to it and I'll delete this post. 

As you improve your cardio conditioning, will a certain heart rate always feel the same even though you're running faster ? 

For instance, I can complete x miles at x speed which keeps my heart in the 160's. That's a challenge, but I can do it.   As I improve, if I increase speed and distance so that I keep my heart rate consistent, will it be the same challenge ? 

Does this also mean that if I want to continuously improve my cardio strength, ignoring running for the moment, that I actually need to increase my speed and distance not to become a better runner, but to keep my heart rate the same so that I'm providing the same level of relative excursion ?  As in if you run the same distance, same speed all the time won't you reach an equilibrium where you no longer get the same level of cardio training from it ? 

thanks !  









 Had a bonafide emergency and haven't lifted in 11 days and am going in tonight.   Last session I progressed my weights.  Tonight should I continue with the progressed weights, or go back to my previous weight ? 

Edit: Hey, thanks everyone. Man, thanks for the encouragement.  I just had a fantastic workout.  Took 2 minutes off my 2m run, and progressed 5 lbs on all my lifts.  I was worried that I was approaching too long a delay and would never make it back but now I'm back in the swing.  thankx !  




 Hey guys, me again, skeptical old skool guy transitioning to modern pricey stuff.

I've been hiking in desert boots forever now (when I'm not just wearing sneaks).  I decided to try some new commercial boots and really liked the Asolo Restons.  Spent a long time trying them again other boots, buy them, and with an hour of wearing them at home get alot of pain where my left lateral metatarsal joins the cuboid (basically the bony protrusion below the little toe).   I loosen the lacing, try to accommodate it, but at that point it was too hot already. This morning that area was still red.   

Not sure why, because in the store they felt really good.  I like the 'narrow through the arch' fit as my running shoes are  like that. 


Does this mean I need wider boots, or is this just a matter or breaking them in? Do synthetic shoes even break in ? Will they conform to my foot like leather does ? 

I'm wearing them now and they feel only snug, not painful.  I paid more attention to give the lower laces slack while cranking only the ankle portion. 

Back when I played hockey the pro shot was able to heat my skate's boot up and bump out a hotspot for me; can you do that with synthetic hiking boots ? 

And if I really just need different boots, how is big R with taking stuff like this back ?  I'm a little sheepish about it because I'm not one to gratuitously return stuff, and I spent forever trying on different boots.  

thanks again for your patience and advice.  




 If anyone has "hiked" in both BDU or ACU pants, as well as dedicated 'hiking pants', could you give me some feedback on why you think the hiking pants are worth it ?  

I've spent plenty of time in bdu's or just cheap cotton civie cargo pants, and wondering what I'm missing. 

they don't seem to have very good carrying capacity, ie few pockets and not very deep.  They also dont seem designed to tuck in at the boots, but i suppose the threat of ticks and critters isn't as high on a maintained trail as it is when say laying prone for hours on end.  




 I've decided the first and best use case for us to migrate to newer HA tech is to replace the Hunter remotes in our fans (since we can never find the remotes anyhow, and replacement/additionals are ridiculously priced).   But, in all my searching, it seems there's exactly ONE ceiling fan controller that goes in the canopy and controls the lights and fan ?

 




 Bought a pricey DLINK wireless camera DCS 5222L yesterday and returned it same day.  I was seriously disappointed in the image quality from 5 feet away in a brightly lit room. 

Are they all that bad ? Or does PoE offer better images.   




 I just bought this DCS-5222L and it feels like a blast from the past.  I mean that in a bad way.   For the 160-190 price tag I expect much, much better images than this at much higher resolution.  The MyDlink site and software doesn't exactly wow either.  I mean seriously, it's 2015 and you want me to run an APPLET ? skeptical look on face 

Do all wireless cameras suck as cameraing ? Can anyone suggest a better one ? 

I just want something I can mount outside that uses PIR to trigger video which I can then view from a mobile device or web app.  Preferrably which dispalys events on a timeline.  

I'm willing to pay for something like a Sensr as well, particularly if it employs any advanced imagry analysis techniques beyond just showing me a video. 

 




 All I'm planning for winter packing and camping and am trying to figure out how cold rated of a bag I really need.  Does anyone have any beta on low temps in the Maryland portion or surrounding areas please ?  I see bags that seem plenty fine, then people call them 3 season so not really sure what I need. Really only wander around Md AT sections and various state parks around Deep Creek going as far as Ohiopyle, would definitely love to get back to WVa like Dolly Sodds. Thanks! 




  Question for folks who have transitioned from mummy bags to rect/semi-rect - does the increase in comfort by having more wiggle room outweigh the extra size and weight ?  Or you do you kind of wish you stayed with lighter smaller bags ? 

My 15-20 y/o cat's meow just makes me claustrophobic now.   




 I received a new dock for my M7 and noticed that it occasionally slow charges, and my phone will display the slow charge message.  But not all time, and it does this despite using the same cable and adapter that consistently provide fast-charge. 

The dock does say "power and data transfer" on it, but if the dock itself only allowed 500ma through, then I'd get the slow charge message all the time, not intermittently.  It may be a quality issue with the dock pinouts, but in the meantime does the M7 do anything like intentionally switch to slow charge mode as it's nearing topping off ?  I hadn't noticed before, but I honestly don't track when updates are pushed, or what's in the updates.  

AND ... is it just me, or is this sub's CSS using white-on-white for stuff ?  




 My M7 lags horrendously and I have to suspect it was due to enabling encryption.  I swear there are times when it takes 15 seconds to register a touch.  When it's acting up it becomes an infuriatingly useless collection of precious metals.  

Anyone else have this issue ? I've already gone through and removed many apps, disabled a bunch of the pointless carrier spam apps, cleared caches, etc.  I'm only using 20 out of 32 gigs storage.   

I have at least 5 other Android devices in my household which have never experienced anything like this - and they don't have encryption  - so I can't help but point the finger at encryption.   




 I'm old enough that I was around for a lot of technologies when they were new, and then things changed. Looks like HA is one of those. 

I picked  up some X10 around, I don't know, 6 years ago ? 8 ?  And used it on or two thing than really got into it.  I have their desktop controller, and some keychain fobs as well.  Those things are the best - come home late at night, foyer light automatically on.  

I picked up plenty of receptacle controllers for very cheap at RadioShack a couple years ago as well, and actually  still have several new in their packaing. I installed several light switches, the neat kind that work both as addressable but also as regular manual switches as well. 

When my outdoor lamp finally gave way, I replaced it with an X10 one a couple years ago, love it and it's still going strong.  Great deal too. 

I just read this: http://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/z9a60/insteon_zwave_x10_or_something_else/  that said X10 was basically a dead company, yet their website it still alive (I'm old enough to remember when they ruined the Web with popunders).  

I never could figure out how to get a decent interface into it though and really build "automation" into it; always used it more as "remote control".  I remember installing software and buying a home and using what seemed to be their first or second approach at software control and not liking it. 

I see alot of discussion against x10 in many cases but it appeared to be related more to having problems with it.  I'm not having any problems with it.  It works on my wiring just fine for whatever reason (old house, built around the time the x10 protocol was, I suppose that's why). 

So aside from not being able to (easily) control my stuff from my phone/tablet/phablet/wearable, are there compelling reasons to buy into the new fangled stuff ?  

Don't get me wrong - a rock solid, reliable, affordable solution that also gives me great mobile access will get my money for sure, but I"m hesitant to go buy new just because it's new. 

As an example I did spend on a Nest last year, and had to return both of them.  They literally wouldn't stfu.  They were still babbling at the Home Depot return desk, which was funny; certainly didn't require much explanation as to why I was returning them. 
 




 Hi all, 

Not intending this as asking medical advice, really more product advice if that's ok.   But first, I want to thank y'all for what you do for folks.  My PT's were really awesome and I came out with not just a stronger foot but really kind of a whole new lease on life and a renewed focus on fitness, so PT's of the world I thank ya.

They used an OTPT stretch Ez on it and that thing will change your life if you've never *really* stretched before (I thought I knew what stretching was, PT and Yoga taught me I had no clue what stretching was).   I'd like to buy one, but I see there's also generic stretching straps that can be used for more stretches as well like upper body.  I don't want to buy more than I need - does anyone know if a regular stretching strap can provide the same "through the foot" stretch that the stretch ez will, even though they don't have the booty ?  Or perhaps I should really buy both. 

Thanks !  









 hey all, 

I'm not on the program, but this seemed like a better sub to ask than /r/running since this program resembles what I've been doing on my own. I started walking routinely about a year and a half ago and getting my legs back.  Recently I started hitting the treadmill and am happily making gains. I started a couple months ago walking around 3-3.5 mph with the occasional run around 6mph for a minute, than back down.  I've been making gains, and my baseline speed is now 4ish, with sprints up to 8.5.  

Both are fine.  I mean, I'm sweating like a pig, I'm definitely seriously focusing but I love it, and both feel bio mechanically correct, both feel like I should be doing it. But jogging is the suxor and I can't stand it.  No specific pain, not shin splints (know them), not a sprain, strain or fracture (yup, know them too )  but just an overall lower body rejection of what I'm doing. 

Is it normal to have trouble with jogging despite being very comfortable walking and running ? Maybe it's a weight thing (I'm over 200 lbs) or a form thing ( I'm graceful  like an elephant) ?  Or is this just a suck it up and it'll improve thing ? 

thx. 




 Our cars are showing their age so at point last year I started researching polishers and detailing and had different items in a wishlist to compare and keep learning.  My bad, I was really just using it as placeholders and had  3 or 4 polishers in it... but well, awesome wife sees wishlist, sees I'm looking at polishers and knowing the brand decides to get me a Dewalt.  So now I'm the proud owner of a Dewalt DWP849X. 

BEAUTIFUL tool.   Clearly exceptional build quality with many useful features.  This is perhaps only the second Dewalt I've ever splurged for, but boy you literally feel the difference except ... I've never used a polisher.  I was doing research to start off.

So now I have this awesome polisher, but it's straight up rotary and I'm trying to decide whether to keep it, or return it and get a DA.

Pros I see, as in leaning to keep: 
- Shipping it back would cost me at least something. 
- Variable power as low as 600 rpm which seems to be lower than most DA's. Probably not as risky to use as fixed-speed rotary's.
- Dewalt. 
- Would grow with my skills
- Can use it for polishing wordworking as well, although that wouldn't be often at all
- Large size means working large panels faster especially on her van.
- Able to grow with me should I ever start learning how to correct. 
- Have done plenty of work with my hands, learn pretty quickly, not klutzy.

Cons I see: 
- Expensive.  
- Only working on my own cars. Need to fix up some scratches and chips, other than that just routine beautification. 
- Never used one before. 
- Larger means not being able to easily work tight spaces
- Larger pads seems harder to find, less selection
- Different spindle size/threads  than smaller DA's means getting backer more difficult

The car's themselves are pretty well dinged up.  Mine has a bunch of rock chips, and hers has all sorts of fine scratches.  Do any of them really require a rotary or would I be able to address them with a DA ? 

Pictures here: http://imgur.com/a/84FmA

This has honestly been a minor dilemna for us.  Wife keeps asking if she should return it and I'm not sure what to tell her.  Appreciate any advice y'all give.

 




 I'm really not finding any dog barriers that thrill me, so I'm considering just making my own out of 1" webbing.  

Has anyone ever installed any sort of tiedown/lashing points *inside* their car ?  Any tips, urls, search terms you could point me to ? 

 




 Looking for folks to go out and be active with. I've done Meetup in the past, it's great, but it's always fixed schedules, RSVP first, large groups, etc.   I've been making good progress in the gym and want to get more active in the outdoor rec dept. before the monotony of the gym sets in.  

I'm into hiking, climbing, backpacking, camping (as in car) and have plenty of gear including kayaks, TR setups, etc.   Looking for cool progressive, educated (self or otherwise) motivated folks, figured Reddit would be a good place to look.  No crime/420 please. 
 




 I'm not vegetarian but my daughter is. For Christmas each year I like to make homemade peppermint marshmallows for everyone and as gifts.  They're a big hit, but there's a couple ingredients that are no-no's for strict vegetarians: sugar and gelatine.  My daughter's choice has had a great positive impact on the rest of the family's nutrition.   I for one don't identify vegetarian but literally can't remember the last time I ate meat now.  Out of respect for her I'd really like to make some vegetarian marshmallows.   I already use char-free natural sugar, so no problems there.  The issue comes with gelatine which is an animal product.   Even "kosher" gelatine is animal based.   I managed to track down some agar flakes (agar is basically processed kelp, it's used to make all those super-firm asian gelatine treats), and was very careful about researching conversions from flakes to power, agar to gelatine, etc. I experimented with two different batches, taking notes.  the first batch was just "fluff"and wouldn't aerate at all, despite having slightly overcooked the sugar past soft-ball more towards hard-ball.  I figured they would aerate and set too hard, but the opposite happened.   Second batch aerated better, came out with more of a gelatenous composition, so I poured it to set in the casserole dish... but it never set.  Basically ended up being really smooth, nice frosting. It was tasty, but not a marshmallow.

I really want to perfect this.  I've read and studied plenty of internet recipes but this one particular area of vegetarian cooking seems to be pretty mythical, or I'm doing something very wrong, or I'm doing it right and vegetarian marshmallows will just never come out the same as gelatine based ones.  I do know now not to buy flakes again, as the conversion from flakes to powder is just another area to go wrong with.   Having to boil the agar is another twist that changes the mechanics of "normal" recipes. 

If you'd successfully made vege/vegan marshmallows, would you mind sharing some tips with me ?  I can google recipes, did plenty of that, but it's just not working.   I feel bad that my daughter suddenly can't enjoy one of our favorite winter treats and out of respect for her I'd really like to nail this recipe.  I promise if I can nail it I"ll make a full write, with photos, ingredient sources, etc since this seems to be a unicorn of vegetarianism.

thanks ! 


 




 I've pretty much stopped clicking any Reddit links to YouTube.   




 I'm amazed at how professionally and positively you guys approach a tough job full of constant asshole customers and just couldn't resist saying something about it.  

I'll go back to lurking now.

 I read about Fannie's homestyle and am interested in the potential for using that to reduce renovation cash outlays on investment property. 



If I understand it correctly, I can borrow up to 100% of the completely value based on an appraisal, but I have to put 10% of the reno costs down, plus whatever cash down the mortage lender requires, but then I get to ammortize those reno costs over the life of the loan, drastically reducing cash outlays when buying.  Unfortunately my costs of reno will be increased by their requirements to use contractors and reducing my sweat equity opportunities only their approved tasks (which I can't find). 



I'm really having a lot of trouble finding good information though; just a lot of copypasta of their marketing verbiage.  Couldn't even get search hits on Reddit, and you can get search hits on *anything* on Reddit. Is this a brand new product, or a product that just doesn't have a market ? I'm guessing there are few lenders I could get one through, and it probably comes with a higher rate.  I don't see it mentioned on my CU's site either, so I'm guessing they don't offer it :( 



Does anyone have any idea where I can find good hard info on it ? I need the deetz ....thank you ! 





EDDIT: I just read the title.  Phrasing.  "Fannie Mae Homestyle Renovation Loans" would be a bit more appropriate.

 Hello, 

Pulled a report today, it was a really odd report - nothing wrong or inaccurate, but it had accounts on there from 20 years ago, all marked OK, paid as agreed, etc, but I had to jog down memory lane to recognize some of it.  

Is that normal ? Should I be worried about it ? 

There were also some hard pulls and soft pulls I didn't recognize.  I'll have to sort those out a bit and then refute.  But if I'm already in the high 760's, is there any benefit to trying to get my credit higher than that ?  Will I get a better mortgage rate or car loan ?

Thanks

 














 We get reminded of this every year. 




 
I'm a slug who just got off PT, I've been getting into basic shape with a yoga/pilates class (love it)  but I want to add an extra class to build on the momentum and add diversity. 

I was wondering if there are branches of bodyweight that aren't quite strictly bodyweight only, but may incorporate some of the toys we used in PT, like elastic bands for doing sideways walking, medicine balls, bosu's, etc.  I realize I could incorporate all this at home myself into traditional bodyweight routines, but I'm really hoping that it exists as a "thing" so I can start googling nearby classes.  

thanks !  




 HI everyone, 

I've been using lumbar support pillows them religiously for about 5 years but I still had posture problems and plenty of back pain.  Standing up straight was still an effort that I couldn't maintain long.  

Recently I started doing a combination of yoga and pilates with great results.  I  noticed that the instructor continuously emphasizes keeping the back down, not arched up, and suspected maybe my pillow was hurting me by arching my lower back out.  So I removed it from the car, and I've been driving for a week without it. 

It felt odd at first, and hurt a bit - my back hadn't felt the unmodified contours of a car seat for half a decade, but now I feel as if my back is getting stronger and my posture is improving. 

Could it be that the pillow long term was actually pushing my back into a curve ? I think maybe it was crutching me - pushing my back into a curve but supporting it for me, but then when I'm out of the car/office chair my back wants to stay curved and now with no support. 

Sound feasible, or maybe it's just the yoga/pilates only ?  




 Hey y'all,

I'm new here.  I was poking around /r/bbq for a bit saw this /r/smoking. That confused me a bit, since we *all know* (right?) that barbecue is smokin. If it ain't smoked, it ain't que. 

But this sub looks like my people.  So I wanted to ask y'all, I'm sure we've all smoked new/ slightly unusual things (like trying beef ribs for the first time, smoking a turkey) but I was hoping to hear some of the unusual things folks have smoked.   

In addition to all the usual stuff like beer, pork, chicken, sausage, stuffed jalapenos, I've smoked a whole salmon (Costco, it was fawesome), filet, crabcakes, lobster tail (that trio is typically reserved for birthday dinners for a special someone), cheese (HOT smoked, made a smoked fondue, highly recommended), and ... I've smoked tandoori chicken, which is definitely a favorite.  

What kind of interesting "out of the ordinary" stuff have y'all smoked ?

 Hey hey, I got a Subaru Outback, and I'm really digging it.  I also have some wildling dogs though, and could use some advice on best seat covers and compartment separators if you wouldn't mind.  I love the leather interior and don't want them clawing it up when they're roaming, and one dog is so big and crazy she just needs a little solitary in the back when we're driving. 

Do they make neoprene seat covers ? 

thanks !

Profiles are too mis-matched to just butt and caulk, so  I'll be coping it.

Question is - rip the base so that the top edges of the molding are at the same level, or rip is so that the curves are at  the same level ?  

I really wanted a shorter base molding that would hit the curb on the flat part only, but wife kept insisting on full height base molding... sure none'ya ever been in that position before right .... 

thanks! 
 




 tl;dr: I have forgotten how to carpentry and a small task is turning into a comical ordeal. What do you do when a simple project kicks your butt ? 


Finishing up a major bath overhaul, and it's time for casing and molding. Did a great job painting, thinking "man, in 2 more days I'll be bathing in this bad boy".  That was a week ago. How little did I know.

The drywall didn't come close to flush anywhere along the jamb.  Sure, I've dealt with that before; just ripped some extensions, putty and finish well and it looks great.  So I rip some extensions. Except on one upright the edge waves back and forth between proud and recessed.  That's a new twist, I start trying to deal with it.

Grab the casing in the garage, case out the door.  Rosettes instead of mitres, looking good, grab the base molding, cut to length, fits great. Except wots this ? the base molding is thicker than the casing ? How did I NOT notice that before installing it ? Seriously ?

Go buy new molding with the wife.  Goes well; we agree on the pieces,, she pulls I cut (by the foot at the shop), get home, perfect lengths, goes with room, great.  Start measuring and cutting, my brain goes numb and I cut my first mitre backwards.  Ok, I have two other sticks.  hmmm, this one's pine, this one's mdf.  And this one is uncorrectably warped; in our hurry neither one of us did a good job picking the sticks. And now it's cut and useless.  For real. I bought millwork from a box store without checking it.  It's like I've never done this before. 

go back later, get new molding, carefully culling this time. Get back, study the job some more, there's really no easy way to work the jamb extensions... it's a toughie.  Decide to mash the drywall down a bit instead.  Forget to score it.  So there's a fresh crack running up the wall now. Yup, put down the tools and walk away.  Sir, step away from the nailer. 

I am honestly not an incapable person. I've done some great carpentry work around the house, but for this one project- which really should be like an hour max-  I feel like I've stepped into some sort of Twilight Zone and have suddenly forgotten everything I ever knew and am now a bumbling idiot with all thumbs who have never seen a compound mitre saw. You'd laugh watching me fumble with this. 

Have any of you ever had to deal with this sort of situation where you're doing a pretty run of the mill project, and for some reason it just kicks your butt ? How do you deal  with it ?  Do I need to just walk away from it for a day, clear my head ?  Or is it time to admit defeat and call someone ?


Edit: Hey thanks everyone.  Glad to know I'm not the only one who's been in this boat.   SO - I just finished casing the door, and it looks good.  Even the mitre's - my first - came out pretty darn good. 

I needed to get away from it a bit, and take my time more.  ALSO, brutalzing the drywall turned out to be the right thing to do.  Between pounding it with a block, and shaving off a high spot I actually got a much better fit without jamb extensions than I did with it.  Using lots of clamps to hold all the pieces in place helped me tweaking the mitre,  and definitely using straight lumber was a huge help; one area in particularly where I swore the jamb was swelling was actually just crowning in the stick.  So  a combination better sticks, trying a new technique, and just getting my head out of it for a while really helped.  

My day is much better now, thanks.  Now I'm done with the door casing and ready to ~~fuckup~~ start the window casing.  Thanks all, happy Friday !  




 Up until earlier this year I hadn't really eaten in an "Italian restaurant" for about 20 years. Then earlier this year my son and I make a trip to the city, and we end up on a late night binge in Little Italy.  I have no idea where we ended up ; probably like the only place still open.  Can't remember what he got, but I had risotto for the first time... risottoe con fungi. In February. In the city.   I died and went to heaven. 

Fast forward several months, and I finally work up the courage to try eating Italian out back home.  Twice, two different restaurants.  Now I'm sad.  I'm spoiled forever for great Italian.   

Is it really that hard to find solid, top quality Italian food outside of NYC ? 
Is it a case of stupid consumers who think anything with tomato sauce on it is "good italian food" as long as it's served with bread and oil ?   




 I jumped on neighborgoods (http://neighborgoods.net/) a couple months ago because I have a ton of tools that don't get used enough.  Seems like a great way to build community; tools are expensive, contractors are expensive, and alot of DIY is having the right tool for the job.  

Plenty of folks can afford to buy tools, but it doesn't always make sense if you're only going to use it once.  Some tools can be rented, some cannot, and why rent if you don't have too ? Access to tools and DIY experience can be a powerful economic enabler as well.  

Hop on the site though and check it out.  It's free.  We need more Columbia on there.  Other smaller, closer knit communities are really active on it and some towns even have public "Tool Sheds" for folks to use. 

Ironically I told a couple neighbors about it and let them know I have stuff on there to lend, and they gave me the "u trying to sell me something" look.  I'm not. It's free.  The sites free, borrowing is free.   I did it to be a little more civic minded and neighborly. 

check it out.

 Hey everyone, new to this sub. 

I've been thinking about soloar for a while now, but I'm having trouble digesting all the data.  I'm in central Maryland and I'd like to have someone come out, take a look and give me ideas of my options.  Thing is, I'm not married to solar yet and if the payback time is forever than I may not do it.  Is there an 'average payback time' ?  Any recommendations of  folks to call in central  Md ? 

thanks!

Edit: Wow, I"m impressed.  I only recently joined Reddit and thought it was all about memes and pet photos.  I can't believe how much really helpful advice there is (I've been contributing as well, not just asking).  It's like having  every specialty forum under one roof.  Thank you all very much for the extremely helpful info. 









 howdy,
Title says it all. have to paint some fresh drywall. good mud job, no skimcoat and for the life of me I can't find any Gardz or Drawtite. SW carries R-35, anyone ever use it ? Think it will do the job ? This is in a bath room with only late afternoon sunlight, one window, but bright overhead lighting with a semi going on the wall. shower, not tub, expecting some humidity.
thank y'all !

I had originally posted this in /r/painting before I realized that was an artist sub, doh.

 I'm a new Subie driver, bought mine used around 100k miles.  I came off a VW that had more miles than this on it, and the VW drove really tight; the steering, the cornering, everything on it felt way more put together. 

On the Subaru, it all feels kind of loose if that makes sense. Nothing specific, like it's not obviously pulling to one side, or there isn't obvious play when turning the streeting wheel, it just doesn't feel well put together. 

 I've heard that Subarus have been known to have rattles and just kind of odd stuff, although they have good bones.  Is this just how Subies drive, or should I get my alignment and steering checked ?  I still have a few months left on the warrant, so I'd like to stem off anything major while I still can.  

thanks !

 I'm in the finishing stages of my epic bathroom r/m and am ready to install the electrical fixtures.  

I love the look of Adorne, and really have to commend them for actually considering design.  But they're pricey, so out of due diligence does anyone have real-world feedback they wouldn't mind sharing ?  




 I've been googling but for some reason my brain won't make this clear to me.  I have a Roth @ ScottTrade that isn't doing too hot, and I'd like to put it into a Vanguard index fund.  Can I do buy that from within my ScottTrade account or do I have to create an account at vanguard and somehow transfer it over ?  Is there any disadvantage to just buying it from withing ScottTrade, like will  they charge me an unnecessary fee ? 
The actual amount is a mere pittance, like 4k.
