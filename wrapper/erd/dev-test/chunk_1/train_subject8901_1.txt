 Actually, scratch that last comment, she drank potion and didn't die, so there must be some kind of power in her.

Unless, of course, she was expecting to be poisoned and drank some antivenom from her many, many tiny jars with love dust and whatnot...

Hmmm  




 I know, also, why does she need potions to conjure magic and trap men? *cough, cough* Stanis *cough, cough* 




 I don't think she will, she was very surprised when that happened and was like: I don't know how to do that *sob, sob* 




 Always wanted a pet rat but decided to get married.

Worked out though I got a mother in law *lol* 




 Actually I just realized that, also, the fact that she has failed to fulfill prophecies.

I don't think she has the power to resurrect Jon Snow so him coming back as a white walker is quite possible.

Damn it George, get your shit together man! 




 True that, true that 




 What about the death of Joffrey Cuntface and Rob Stark?

Or was that just a strange coincidence? 




 I actually don't like her much 




 The drug dealer neighbor that throws badass parties with donkeys, cheap booze and a lot of Brown nipples 









 Hey guys,  I don't really know how this works yet, so forgive me if I screw up.

Been a quiet observer for a while but now decided to join reddit, and now am totally confused.

So yeah...
