 I learn that the solar panel generate more power than required by the stadium. Just curious to know what they do with the excess energy produced? And how is the stadium managed? Does the government take care of the management or is it privately managed? 




 Honestly, Pluto shouldn't be a part of the family portrait. It's not a planet anymore - the dwarf planet it is.
