 The third is that to the extent he stands for anything, it is for maintenance of a status quo that continues to wreck the country in order to service the greed of a few oligarchs.  The fourth is that he fundamentally does not understand the powers and the role of the modern presidency.  And the fifth is that he maintains the worst communications apparatus in the White House since Jimmy Carter prowled its corridors.  In fairness to his communications team, though, he has given them almost nothing to sell.  You try singing the praises of bailing out Goldman Sachs one hundred cents on the dollar, or of a health care plan that forces people to buy plans they don't want from hated insurance vultures.  It ain't easy, pal.  Yet, on the other hand, Bush and Cheney had far less than nothing to sell when it came to the Iraq war - indeed, they had nothing but lies - and their team handled that masterfully.

Could an ideology ever have been more obviously shown to be catastrophic in its effects?  And yet here we are arguing in public about doubling down on those policy ideas, while the two major political parties both pretend to be limiting the worst practices of the most predatory actors, as they simultaneously accept bags of money from the very same folks at the very same time."

Even a cursory glance at human history and most other forms of society outside the Western world reveal how culturally specific and temporal Economic Man really is; as the economic historian Karl Polanyi stated, no other society outside of our own has ever raised the pursuit of economic gain to the guiding principle of society or understood it as definitive of the human condition.

 Tangentially related -- my daughter diaper-trained herself at about 2 when we were staying at a beach in Africa where everyone peed and pooped in the sand dunes.  She went naked most of the time but the important thing was being with adults, both male and female, and watching their process, including burying the poop.

Took the mystery out of it for her anyway and gave her something to imitate. 




 Transparency, accountability and oversight -- in government at all levels, in business, Wall Street, Main Street.  These are not even partisan -- independents, sane Republicans, libertarians could get behind them.  They are general overarching goals that need specifics developed.

 Kindergarten through 12th grade.

So the article says. 




 from the article:
Ninety-five percent of criminologists study blue collar crime.

Five percent study white collar crime.

Of the tiny minority who study white collar crime, ninety five percent focus on the individuals who rip off the corporation.

We are left with a small handful of criminologists  think Edwin Sutherland, John Braithwaite, Gil Geis  who have studied or are studying  corporate crime.

That would be crime by the corporation.

Bill Black is one of the most prominent of those living corporate criminologists.

 The author of that quote, Naomi Klein, says elsewhere in the article:

 No, it's just a matter of us all being in this together.  Your health impacts me and my health impacts you.  Just as I'm happy if some of my tax money goes to educate your kids.

 Another single-Xer here, moved to respond by the flurry of thoughts and feelings triggered by your post and all the comments. 

There is something of value in all the comments and I'm heartened by all the good advice.  The basic issues seem to me to be related to how to be in the world, and they apply to all of us, of whatever age or gender.  I don't mean to denigrate the advice about makeup and clothes -- it's good advice and may be more accessible than 'deeper' issues.  

Even though you don't want to move in with your dad, I hope you can find a way to use your relationship with him as a source of strength.  And I suggest that it's helpful to remember that however misguided your mother is, she loves you and mostly intends what she says to be for what she thinks is good for you.  And you can love her back, this deeply flawed woman, without succumbing to her warped views.

Make no mistake, though, Qeraeth is right in characterizing this as emotional abuse.  Not many of us grew up without some abuse, but still I think it's better to call it what it is.  The thing to do is to use that knowledge to free yourself from the entanglements.  Detachment doesn't mean separation, just kind of getting unhooked (huge work at your age, but you're up to it).

Stay tight with friends who understand and support you without a lot of judgement.  You don't need to push the others away unless they're really toxic, just don't tune yourself to their opinions.

This sub-reddit looks like it could be a valuable resource for you.  Use what works and don't let the rest slow you down.  Bless you.

 




 The headline is a quote from two paragraphs above yours.  Though it would have been better without the quotation marks that imply it's a direct quote from Kucinich. 




 Interesting that there we no comments from tailgaters.  Because they dare not reply or because redditors are mostly too smart for that?  I'm inclined to think the latter. 




 Yeah, I do that sometimes.  Once to a cop who I hadn't noticed, but who dropped back quickly.  I've also had someone edge closer though. 




 You do realize the headline is a quote from the article, don't you? 




 Mine too.

 I appreciate the nuance and gentleness with with you approach this.

 It seems to me the best chance for effectiveness would come from supporting issues a broad spectrum could agree on, not something that would divide for leftists from libertarians, free marketeers from social democrats.  

There are a number of voting reform issues -- some kind of [preference voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_voting);  insuring the [integrity of the vote](http://www.verifiedvoting.org/); providing for expanded but verified registration; insuring that waiting lines for voting are reduced and are not skewed by voting district.

To the extent that we can call for accountability, transparency and oversight without having the arguments devolve into anti-regulatory rhetoric, those are overarching concerns that deserve wide support.  They also importantly allow for a correctable result instead of fixing even a good policy into place that later has unintended consequences.

A couple of personal favorites of mine are the abolition of corporate personhood, and opening media advertising to include issue advocacy so that the networks couldn't deny Adbusters, for example, the right to buy air time.  Those causes may have narrower support though.  




 Notice it said "unemployed or underemployed."

 Like its predecessors, the Obama administration treats additional government funding as a solution to unaffordable health care, rather than its cause. The current reform will likely expand our governments already massive role in health-care decision-makingall just to continue the illusion that someone else is paying for our care. 




 All of the health-care interest groupshospitals, insurance companies, professional groups, pharmaceuticals, device manufacturers, even advocates for the poorhave a major stake in the current system. Overturning it would favor only the 300 million of us who use the system andwhether we realize it or notpay for it. 




 The most important single step we can take toward truly reforming our system is to move away from comprehensive health insurance as the single model for financing care. And a guiding principle of any reform should be to put the consumer, not the insurer or the government, at the center of the system. 




 A wasteful insurance system; distorted incentives; a bias toward treatment; moral hazard; hidden costs and a lack of transparency; curbed competition; service to the wrong customer. These are the problems at the foundation of our health-care system, resulting in a slow rot and requiring more and more money just to keep the system from collapsing. 




 Only in the bizarre parallel universe of health care could limiting supply be seen as a sensible approach to keeping prices _down_. 




 Keeping prices opaque is one way medical institutions seek to avoid competition and thereby keep prices up. Without transparency on prices-and the related data on measurable outcomes-efforts to give the consumer more control over health care have failed, and always will. 




 Imagine confiscating all the profits of all the famously greedy health-insurance companies. That would pay for 4 days of health care for all Americans. Lets add in the profits of the 10 biggest rapacious U.S. drug companies. Another 7 days. Indeed, confiscating all the profits of all American companies, in every industry, wouldnt cover even five months of our health-care expenses. 




 For almost all our health-care needs, the current system allows us as consumers to ask providers, Whats my share? instead of How much does this cost?-a question we ask before buying any other good or service. And the subtle difference between those two questions is costing us all a fortune. 




 Insurance is probably the most complex, costly, and distortional method of financing any activity; thats why it is otherwise used to fund only rare, unexpected, and large costs. 




 There was nothing natural or inevitable about the way our system developed: employer-based, comprehensive insurance crowded out alternative methods of paying for health-care expenses only because of a poorly considered tax benefit passed half a century ago. 




 The federal government spends eight times as much on health care as it does on education, 12 times what it spends on food aid to children and families, 30 times what it spends on law enforcement, 78 times what it spends on land management and conservation, 87 times the spending on water supply, and 830 times the spending on energy conservation. Education, public safety, environment, infrastructure-all other public priorities are being slowly devoured by the health-care beast. 




 Unless we fix the problems at the foundation of our health system-largely problems of incentives-our reforms wont do much good, and may do harm. Health care will need to become subject to the same forces that have boosted efficiency and value throughout the economy. 




 The comprehensive reform being contemplated merely cements in place the current system-insurance-based, employment-centered, administratively complex. It addresses the underlying causes of our health-care crisis only obliquely, if at all; indeed, by extending the current system to more people, it will likely increase the ultimate cost of true reform. 




 Accidentally, but relentlessly, America has built a health-care system with incentives that inexorably generate terrible and perverse results. Incentives that emphasize health care over any other aspect of health and well-being. That emphasize treatment over prevention. That disguise true costs. That favor complexity, and discourage transparent competition based on price or quality. That result in a generational pyramid scheme rather than sustainable financing. And thatmost importantremove consumers from our irreplaceable role as the ultimate ensurer of value. 




 There needs to be a _business reason_ why an industry, year in and year out, would be able to get away with poor customer service, unaffordable prices, and uneven results. 




 The issue of "planting" came up in the comments but nothing in the article suggested that.  I didn't find anything in the article that would support the notion that it was a plant. 




 Forced Camel Case.  Even In Email Address. Not Right. 




 Why does americanoddjobs make irresponsible generalizations? 




 What kind of health care should be available to people that employ consistent poor decision-making over many years?  If they are very low income, as many of them are, how should it be funded? 




 How many supporters of life with parole for minors would include their own children and relatives?

 So if the author were charged with a crime, he presumably wouldn't assert a right to a trial by his peers.

Rights may be characterized as intrinsic, but that doesn't mean they can't be granted.  Over time, societies come to grant expanded rights.  

Many countries now treat health care as a right.  Some of wish to join them.

 Resources on aging seem to be mostly about slowing, resisting, preventing, delaying or diminishing.  Where are some resources that deal with *preparing* for dimished capacity?  Examples:

*  Dealing with no longer being able to live in your own home
*  Accepting help with tasks you used to do yourself
*  Allowing health care 'strangers' to assist you with intimate functions
*  Learning to accept that others'judgements may be more competant than your own

 From William Gibson's [Pattern Recognition (2003)] (http://www.scribd.com/doc/10073557/William-Gibson-Pattern-Recognition-2003):
If there's any one thing about England that Cayce finds fundamentally disturbing, it is how "class" works--a word with a very different mirror-world meaning, somehow. She's long since given up trying to explain this to English friends.

The closest she can come is that it's somewhat akin, for her, if only in its enormity, to how the British seem to feel about certain American attitudes to firearms ownership which they generally find unthinkable, and bafflingly self-evidently wrong, and so often leading to a terrible and profligate waste of human life. And she knows what they mean, but also knows how deeply it runs, the gun thing, and how unlikely it is to change.  Except, perhaps, gradually, and over a very long time. Class in England is like that, for her.

I find this provocative.  Does it resonate? 




 Wouldn't that be like someone from Latin America calling him 'amigo'?

 I recently read a href="http://www.economicgangsters.com/" rel="nofollow"Economic Gangsters: Corruption, Violence, and the Poverty of Nations/a.  It fit well with my interests but I was especially impressed by the authors' emphasis on research and the analysis of data rather than ideology.  Their advocacy for randomized trials looks fruitful where they are even possible.  

How is a layman with no economic training supposed to judge among economic explanations and prescriptions?  Either FDR exacerbated the Depression with his policies or he ameliorated it, but where is the objective basis for which side to choose?  Keynes and von Mises may both be wrong, but both can't be right.  

Sometimes I'm able to criticize the premises of an economic argument or definition.  For example, excluding 'women's work' from GDP calculations seems flawed from the start.  But often I am too easily influenced by the most recent argument I encounter, without anything but my gut to help me.

Most economic reasoning looks to me like its coming from different sides of the elephant, with little hope of agreement.  Is this all there is?

Surely there must be a better way.
