 To be honest man, I would wait until next fall. I know at my school, spring pledges are kind of a joke, and most fraternities don't really even do spring pledgeship. Fall pledgeship is when most guys pledge and this means your pledge class will be a lot bigger. My advice, rush all this spring. Find the guys you fit in with the best. Then come summer you can work a save up for dues. That's just my opinion but best of luck man!
